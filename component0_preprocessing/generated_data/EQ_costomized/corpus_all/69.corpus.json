Schelter is credited with the development of the GNU Common Lisp (GCL) implementation of Common Lisp and the GPL'd version of the computer algebra system Macsyma called Maxima. Schelter authored Austin Kyoto Common Lisp (AKCL) under contract with IBM. AKCL formed the foundation for Axiom, another computer algebra system. AKCL eventually became GNU Common Lisp. He is also credited with the first port of the GNU C compiler to the Intel 386 architecture, used in the original implementation of the Linux kernel. Schelter obtained his Ph.D. at McGill University in 1972. His mathematical specialties were noncommutative ring theory and computational algebra and its applications, including automated theorem proving in geometry. In the summer of 2001, age 54, he died suddenly of a heart attack while traveling in Russia."

        "content": "John Quincy Adams (; July 11, 1767 \u2013 February 23, 1848) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, and diarist, who served as the 6th president of the United States from 1825 to 1829. He previously served as the 8th United States Secretary of State from 1817 to 1825. During his long diplomatic and political career, Adams also served as an ambassador, and as a member of the United States Senate and House of Representatives representing Massachusetts. He was the eldest son of John Adams, who served as the second U.S. president from 1797 to 1801, and First Lady Abigail Adams. Initially a Federalist like his father, he won election to the presidency as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and in the mid-1830s became affiliated with the Whig Party. Born in Braintree, Massachusetts (now part of the town of Quincy), Adams spent much of his youth in Europe, where his father served as a diplomat. After returning to the United States, Adams established a successful legal practice in Boston. In 1794, President George Washington appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands, and Adams would serve in high-ranking diplomatic posts until 1801, when Thomas Jefferson took office as president. Federalist leaders in Massachusetts arranged for Adams's election to the United States Senate in 1802, but Adams broke with the Federalist Party over foreign policy and was denied re-election. In 1809, President James Madison, a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to Russia. Adams held diplomatic posts for the duration of Madison's presidency, and he served as part of the American delegation that negotiated an end to the War of 1812. In 1817, President James Monroe selected Adams as his Secretary of State. In that role, Adams negotiated the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, which provided for the American acquisition of Florida. He also helped formulate the Monroe Doctrine, which became a key tenet of U.S. foreign policy. In 1818, Adams was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. Adams, Andrew Jackson, William H. Crawford, and Henry Clay \u2014 all members of the Democratic-Republican Party \u2014 competed in the 1824 presidential election. Because no candidate won a majority of electoral votes, the House of Representatives held a contingent election, which Adams won with the support of Speaker of the House Clay, whom Adams would go on to controversially appoint as his Secretary of State. As president, Adams called for an ambitious agenda that included federally funded infrastructure projects, the establishment of a national university, and engagement with the countries of Latin America, but Congress refused to pass many of his initiatives. During Adams's presidency, the Democratic-Republican Party split into two major camps: the National Republican Party, which supported President Adams, and Andrew Jackson's Democratic Party. The Democrats proved to be more effective political organizers than Adams and his National Republican supporters, and Jackson soundly defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, making Adams the second president after his father to fail to win re-election. Rather than retiring from public service, Adams won election to the House of Representatives, where he would serve from 1831 until his death in 1848. He remains the only ex-president to be elected to the chamber. After narrowly losing his bids for Governor of Massachusetts and Senate re-election, Adams joined the Anti-Masonic Party in the early 1830s before joining the Whig Party, which united those opposed to President Jackson. During his time in Congress, Adams became increasingly critical of slavery and of the Southern leaders who he believed controlled the Democratic Party. He was particularly opposed to the annexation of Texas and the Mexican\u2013American War, which he saw as a war to extend slavery and its political grip on Congress. He also led the repeal of the \"gag rule\", which had prevented the House of Representatives from debating petitions to abolish slavery. Historians concur that Adams was one of the greatest diplomats and secretaries of state in American history; they typically rank him as an average president, as he had an ambitious agenda but could not get it passed by Congress."

        "content": "John Quincy Adams was born on July 11, 1767, to John and Abigail Adams (n\u00e9e Smith) in a part of Braintree, Massachusetts that is now Quincy. He was named after his mother's maternal grandfather, Colonel John Quincy, after whom Quincy, Massachusetts, is named, who died two days after Adams's birth. Young Adams was educated by private tutors \u2013 his cousin James Thaxter and his father's law clerk, Nathan Rice. He soon exhibited literary skills, and in 1779 he started a diary that he kept until just before he died in 1848. Until the age of ten, Adams grew up on the family farm in Braintree, largely in the care of his mother. Though frequently absent because of his participation in the American Revolution, John Adams maintained a correspondence with his son, encouraging him to read works by authors such as Thucydides and Hugo Grotius. With his father's encouragement, Adams would also translate classical authors such as Virgil, Horace, Plutarch, and Aristotle. In 1778, Adams and his father departed for Europe, where John Adams would serve as part of American diplomatic missions in France and the Netherlands. During this period, Adams studied law, French, Greek, and Latin, and attended several schools, including Leiden University. In 1781, Adams traveled to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where he served as the secretary to the American diplomat, Francis Dana. He returned to the Netherlands in 1783 and accompanied his father to Great Britain in 1784. Though Adams enjoyed Europe, he and his family decided he needed to return to the United States to complete his education and eventually launch a political career. Adams returned to the United States in 1785 and earned admission as a member of the junior class of Harvard College the following year. He joined Phi Beta Kappa and excelled academically, graduating second in his class in 1787. After graduating from Harvard, he studied law with Theophilus Parsons in Newburyport, Massachusetts, from 1787 to 1789. Adams initially opposed the ratification of the United States Constitution, but he ultimately came to accept the document, and in 1789 his father was elected as the first Vice President of the United States. In 1790, Adams opened his own legal practice in Boston. Despite some early struggles, he was successful as an attorney and established financial independence from his parents."

        "content": "Adams initially avoided becoming involved in politics, instead focusing on building his legal career. In 1791, he wrote a series of pseudonymously published essays arguing that Britain provided a better governmental model than France. Two years later, he published another series of essays attacking Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat, a French diplomat who sought to undermine President George Washington's policy of neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1794, Washington appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands. Adams considered declining the role, but ultimately took the position on the advice of his father. While abroad, Adams continued to urge neutrality, arguing that the United States would benefit economically by staying out of the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. His chief duty as the ambassador to the Netherlands was to secure and maintain loans essential to U.S. finances. On his way to the Netherlands, he met with John Jay, who was then negotiating the Jay Treaty with Great Britain. Adams supported the Jay Treaty, but it proved unpopular with many in the United States, contributing to a growing partisan split between the Federalist Party of Alexander Hamilton and the Democratic-Republican Party of Thomas Jefferson. Adams spent the winter of 1795\u20131796 in London, where he met Louisa Catherine Johnson, the second daughter of American merchant Joshua Johnson. In April 1796, Louisa accepted Adams's proposal of marriage. Adams's parents disapproved of his decision to marry a woman who had grown up in England, but he informed his parents that he would not reconsider his decision. Adams initially wanted to delay his wedding to Louisa until he returned to the United States, but they married in All Hallows-by-the-Tower in July 1797. Shortly after the wedding, Joshua Johnson fled England to escape his creditors, and Adams did not receive the dowry that Johnson had promised him, much to the embarrassment of Louisa. Adams noted in his own diary that he had no regrets about his decision to marry Louisa. In 1796, Washington appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to Portugal. Later that year, John Adams defeated Jefferson in the 1796 presidential election. When the elder Adams became president, he appointed his son as the U.S. ambassador to Prussia. Though concerned that his appointment would be criticized as nepotistic, Adams accepted the position and traveled to the Prussian capital of Berlin with his wife and his younger brother, Thomas Boylston Adams. The State Department tasked Adams with developing commercial relations with Prussia and Sweden, but President Adams also asked his son to write to him frequently about affairs in Europe. In 1799, Adams negotiated a new trade agreement between the United States and Prussia, though he could never complete an agreement with Sweden. He frequently wrote to family members in the United States, and in 1801 his letters about the Prussian region of Silesia were published in a book titled Letters on Silesia. During his time in Prussia, Adams befriended the German diplomat and writer Friedrich von Gentz, whose work, The Origins and Principles of the American Revolution, Compared with the Origins and Principles of the French Revolution, Adams would translate into English in 1800. In the 1800 presidential election, Jefferson defeated John Adams, and both Adams and his son left office in early 1801."

        "content": "On his return to the United States, Adams re-established a legal practice in Boston, and in April 1802 he was elected to the Massachusetts Senate. In November of that year, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives. In February 1803, the Massachusetts legislature elected Adams to the United States Senate. Though somewhat reluctant to affiliate with any political party, Adams joined the Federalist minority in Congress. Like his Federalist colleagues, he opposed the impeachment of Associate Justice Samuel Chase, an outspoken supporter of the Federalist Party. Adams had strongly opposed Jefferson's 1800 presidential candidacy, but he gradually became alienated from the Federalist Party. His disaffection was driven by the party's declining popularity, disagreements over foreign policy, and Adams's hostility to Timothy Pickering, a Federalist Party leader whom Adams viewed as overly favorable to Britain. Unlike other New England Federalists, Adams supported the Jefferson administration's Louisiana Purchase and expansionist policies. Adams was the lone Federalist in Congress to vote for the Non-importation Act of 1806 that punished Britain for its attacks on American shipping during the ongoing Napoleonic Wars. Adams became increasingly frustrated with the unwillingness of other Federalists to condemn British actions, including impressment, and he moved closer to the Jefferson administration. After Adams supported the Embargo Act of 1807, the Federalist-controlled Massachusetts legislature elected Adams's successor several months before the end of his term, and Adams resigned from the Senate shortly thereafter. While a member of the Senate, Adams served as a professor of logic at Brown University and as the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard University. Adams's devotion to classical rhetoric shaped his response to public issues, and he would remain inspired by those rhetorical ideals long after the neo-classicalism and deferential politics of the founding generation were eclipsed by the commercial ethos and mass democracy of the Jacksonian Era. Many of Adams's idiosyncratic positions were rooted in his abiding devotion to the Ciceronian ideal of the citizen-orator \"speaking well\" to promote the welfare of the polis. He was also influenced by the classical republican ideal of civic eloquence espoused by British philosopher David Hume. Adams adapted these classical republican ideals of public oratory to the American debate, viewing its multilevel political structure as ripe for \"the renaissance of Demosthenic eloquence\". His Lectures on Rhetoric and Oratory (1810) looks at the fate of ancient oratory, the necessity of liberty for it to flourish, and its importance as a unifying element for a new nation of diverse cultures and beliefs. Just as civic eloquence failed to gain popularity in Britain, in the United States interest faded in the second decade of the 19th century, as the \"public spheres of heated oratory\" disappeared in favor of the private sphere."

        "content": "After resigning from the Senate, Adams was ostracized by Massachusetts Federalist leaders, but he declined Democratic-Republican entreaties to seek office. In 1809, he argued before the Supreme Court of the United States in Fletcher v. Peck, and the Supreme Court ultimately agreed with Adams's argument that the Constitution's Contract Clause prevented the state of Georgia from invalidating a land sale to out-of-state companies. Later that year, President James Madison appointed Adams as the first United States Minister to Russia in 1809. Though Adams had only recently broken with the Federalist Party, his support of Jefferson's foreign policy had earned him goodwill with the Madison Administration. Adams was well-qualified for the role after his experiences in Europe generally and Russia specifically. After a difficult passage through the Baltic Sea, Adams arrived in the Russian capital of St. Petersburg in October 1809. He quickly established a productive working relationship with Russian official Nikolay Rumyantsev and eventually befriended Tsar Alexander I of Russia. Adams continued to favor American neutrality between France and Britain during the Napoleonic War. Louisa was initially distraught at the prospect of living in Russia, but she became a popular figure at the Russian court. From his diplomatic post, Adams observed the French Emperor Napoleon's invasion of Russia, which ended in defeat for the French. In February 1811, President Madison nominated Adams as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. The nomination was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, but Adams declined the seat, preferring a career in politics and diplomacy, so Joseph Story took the seat instead."

        "title": "John Quincy Adams_Treaty of Ghent and ambassador to Britain",
        "content": "Adams had long feared that the United States would enter a war it could not win against Britain, and by early 1812, he saw such a war as inevitable due to the constant British attacks on American shipping and the British practice of impressment. In mid-1812, the United States declared war against Britain, beginning the War of 1812. Tsar Alexander attempted to mediate the conflict between Britain and the United States, and President Madison appointed Adams, Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin, and Federalist Senator James A. Bayard to a delegation charged with negotiating an end to the war. Gallatin and Bayard arrived in St. Petersburg in July 1813, but the British declined Tsar Alexander's offer of mediation. Hoping to start negotiations at another venue, Adams left Russia in April 1814. Negotiations finally began in mid-1814 in Ghent, where Adams, Gallatin, and Bayard were joined by two additional American delegates, Jonathan Russell and former Speaker of the House Henry Clay. Adams, the nominal head of the delegation, got along well with Gallatin, Bayard, and Russell, but he occasionally clashed with Clay. The British delegation initially treated the United States as a defeated power, demanding the creation of an Indian barrier state from American territory near the Great Lakes. The American delegation unanimously rejected this offer, and their negotiating position was bolstered by the American victory in the Battle of Plattsburgh. By November 1814, the government of Lord Liverpool decided to seek an end to hostilities with the U.S. on the basis of status quo ante bellum. Even though a return to the status quo would mean the continuation of the British practice of impressment, Adams and his fellow commissioners had hoped for similar terms. The treaty was signed on December 24, 1814. The United States did not gain any concessions from the treaty but could boast that it had survived a war against the strongest power in the world. Following the signing of the treaty, Adams traveled to Paris, where he witnessed first-hand the Hundred Days of Napoleon's restoration. In May 1815, Adams learned that President Madison had appointed him as the U.S. ambassador to Britain. With the aid of Clay and Gallatin, Adams negotiated a limited trade agreement with Britain. Following the conclusion of the trade agreement, much of Adams's time as ambassador was spent helping stranded American sailors and prisoners of war. In pursuit of national unity, newly elected president James Monroe decided a Northerner would be optimal for the position of Secretary of State, and he chose the respected and experienced Adams for the role. Having spent several years in Europe, Adams returned to the United States in August 1817."

        "title": "John Quincy Adams_Secretary of State (1817\u20131825)",
        "content": "Adams served as Secretary of State during Monroe's eight-year presidency, from 1817 to 1825. Many of his successes as secretary, such as the convention of 1818 with the United Kingdom, the Transcontinental Treaty with Spain, and the Monroe Doctrine, were not preplanned strategies but responses to unexpected events. Adams wanted to delay American recognition of the newly independent republics of Latin America to avoid the risk of war with Spain and its European allies. However, Andrew Jackson's military campaign in Florida and Henry Clay's threats in Congress forced Spain to cut a deal, which Adams negotiated successfully. Biographer James Lewis says, \"He managed to play the cards that he had been dealt \u2013 cards that he very clearly had not wanted \u2013 in ways that forced the Spanish cabinet to recognize the weakness of its own hand\". Apart from the Monroe doctrine, his last four years as Secretary of State were less successful because he was preoccupied with his presidential campaign and refused to make compromises with other countries that might have weakened his candidacy; the result was a small-scale trade war but a successful election to the White House. Taking office in the aftermath of the War of 1812, Adams thought that the country had been fortunate in avoiding territorial losses, and he prioritized avoiding another war with a European power, particularly Britain. He also sought to avoid exacerbating sectional tensions, which had been a major issue for the country during the War of 1812. One of the major challenges confronting Adams was how to respond to the power vacuum in Latin America that arose from Spain's weakness following the Peninsular War. In addition to his foreign policy role, Adams held several domestic duties, including overseeing the 1820 Census and writing an extensive report on weights and measures. The weights and measures report, a particular passion of Adams', provided an extensive historical perspective on the topic and advocated for adoption of the metric system. Monroe and Adams agreed on most major foreign policy issues: both favored neutrality in Latin American independence wars, peace with the United Kingdom, rejection of a trade agreement with the French, and peaceful expansion into the Spanish Empire's North American territories. The president and his secretary of state developed a strong working relationship, and while Adams often influenced Monroe's policies, he respected that Monroe made the final decisions on major issues. Monroe met regularly with his five-person cabinet, which initially consisted of Adams, Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford, Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Crowninshield, and Attorney General William Wirt. Adams developed a strong respect for Calhoun but believed that Crawford was unduly focused on succeeding Monroe in 1824. During his time as ambassador to Britain, Adams had begun negotiations over several contentious issues that had not been solved by the War of 1812 or the Treaty of Ghent. In 1817, the two countries agreed to the Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty, which limited naval armaments on the Great Lakes. Negotiations between the two powers continued, resulting in the Treaty of 1818, which defined the Canada\u2013United States border west of the Great Lakes. The boundary was set at the 49th parallel to the Rocky Mountains, while the territory to the west of the mountains, known as Oregon Country, would be jointly occupied. The agreement marked a watershed moment in United Kingdom\u2013United States relations, as the United States focused on its southern and western borders and British concerns about American expansionism subsided."

        "title": "John Quincy Adams_Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty",
        "content": "When Adams took office, Spanish possessions bordered the United States to the south and west. To the south, Spain retained control of Florida, which the U.S. had long sought to purchase. Spain struggled to control the Indian tribes active in Florida, and some of those tribes raided United States territory. To the west, New Spain bordered the territory acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase, but no clear boundary had been established between United States and Spanish territory. After taking office, Adams began negotiations with Luis de On\u00eds, the Spanish minister to the United States, for the purchase of Florida and the settlement of a border between the United States and New Spain. The negotiations were interrupted by an escalation of the Seminole War, and in December 1818, Monroe ordered General Andrew Jackson to enter Florida and retaliate against Seminoles that had raided Georgia. Exceeding his orders, Jackson captured the Spanish outposts of St. Marks and Pensacola and executed two Englishmen. While Jackson's actions outraged the rest of the cabinet, Adams defended them as necessary to the country's self-defense, and he eventually convinced Monroe and most of the cabinet to support Jackson. Adams informed Spain that its failure to police its own territory had compelled Jackson to act, and he advised Spain to either secure the region or sell it to the United States. The British, meanwhile, declined to risk their recent rapprochement with the United States, and did not make a major diplomatic issue out of Jackson's execution of two British nationals. Negotiations between Spain and the United States continued, and Spain agreed to cede Florida. The determination of the western boundary of the United States proved more difficult. American expansionists favored setting the border at the Rio Grande, but Spain, intent on protecting its colony of Mexico from American encroachment, insisted on setting the boundary at the Sabine River. At Monroe's direction, Adams agreed to the Sabine River boundary, but he insisted that Spain cede its claims on Oregon Country. Adams was deeply interested in establishing American control over the Oregon Country, partly because he believed that control of that region would spur trade with Asia. The acquisition of Spanish claims to the Pacific Northwest also allowed the Monroe administration to pair the acquisition of Florida, which was chiefly sought by Southerners, with territorial gains favored primarily by those in the North. After extended negotiations, Spain and the United States agreed to the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, which was ratified in February 1821. Adams was deeply proud of the treaty, though he privately was concerned by the potential expansion of slavery into the newly acquired territories. In 1824, the Monroe administration would strengthen US claims to Oregon by ratifying the Russo-American Treaty of 1824, which established Russian Alaska's southern border at 54\u00b040\u2032 north."

        "content": "As the Spanish Empire continued to fracture during Monroe's second term, Adams, Monroe and Clay became increasingly concerned that the \"Holy Alliance\" of Prussia, Austria, and Russia would seek to bring Spain's erstwhile colonies under their control, to the point of even contemplating a Holy Alliance of their own to defend democracy. In his 1821 Fourth of July address, Adams addressed this issue, noting a shared \"chain of sympathy\" between the U.S. and Latin America, but arguing for neutrality rather than a Holy Alliance. In 1822, following the conclusion of the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, the Monroe administration recognized the independence of several Latin American countries, including Argentina and Mexico. In 1823, British Foreign Secretary George Canning suggested that the United States and Britain should work together to preserve the independence of these fledgling republics. The cabinet debated whether to accept the offer, but Adams opposed it. Instead, Adams urged Monroe to publicly declare the United States' opposition to any European attempt to colonize or re-take control of territory in the Americas, while also committing the United States to neutrality in European affairs. In his December 1823 annual message to Congress, Monroe laid out the Monroe Doctrine, which was largely built upon Adams's ideas. In issuing the Monroe Doctrine, the United States displayed a new level of assertiveness in international relations, as the doctrine represented the country's first claim to a sphere of influence. It also marked the country's shift in psychological orientation away from Europe and towards the Americas. Debates over foreign policy would no longer center on relations with Britain and France, but instead focus on western expansion and relations with Native Americans. The doctrine became one of the foundational principles of U.S. foreign policy."

        "content": "Immediately upon becoming Secretary of State, Adams emerged as one of Monroe's most likely successors, as the last three presidents had all served in the role before taking office. As the 1824 election approached, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun (who later dropped out of the race), and William H. Crawford appeared to be Adams's primary competition to succeed Monroe. Crawford favored state sovereignty and a strict constructionist view of the Constitution, while Clay, Calhoun, and Adams embraced federally funded internal improvements, high tariffs, and the Second Bank of the United States, which was also known as the national bank. Because the Federalist Party had all but collapsed after the War of 1812, all the major presidential candidates were members of the Democratic-Republican Party. Adams felt that his own election as president would vindicate his father, while also allowing him to pursue an ambitious domestic policy. Though he lacked the charisma of his competitors, Adams was widely respected and benefited from the lack of other prominent Northern political leaders. Adams's top choice for the role of vice president was General Andrew Jackson; Adams noted that \"the Vice-Presidency was a station in which [Jackson] could hang no one, and in which he would need to quarrel with no one\". However, as the 1824 election approached, Jackson jumped into the race for president, and Calhoun ended up receiving the Vice-presidential support of Adams supporters. While the other candidates based their candidacies on their long tenure as congressmen, ambassadors, or members of the cabinet, Jackson's appeal rested on his military service, especially in the Battle of New Orleans. The congressional nominating caucus had decided upon previous Democratic-Republican presidential nominees, but it had become largely discredited by 1824. Candidates were instead nominated by state legislatures or nominating conventions, and Adams received the endorsement of the New England legislatures. The regional strength of each candidate played an important role in the election; Adams was popular in New England, Clay and Jackson were strong in the West, and Jackson and Crawford competed for the South. In the 1824 presidential election, Jackson won a plurality in the Electoral College, taking 99 of the 261 electoral votes, while Adams won 84, Crawford won 41, and Clay took 37. Calhoun, meanwhile, won a majority of the electoral votes for vice president. Adams nearly swept the electoral votes of New England and won a majority of the electoral votes in New York, but he won just six electoral votes from the slave states. Most of Jackson's support came from slave-holding states, but he also won New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and some electoral votes from the Northwest. As no candidate won a majority of the electoral votes, the House was required to hold a contingent election under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment. The House would decide among the top three electoral vote winners, with each state's delegation having one vote; thus, unlike his three rivals, Clay was not eligible to be elected by the House. Adams knew that his own victory in the contingent election would require the support of Clay, who wielded immense influence in the House of Representatives. Though they were quite different in temperament and had clashed in the past, Adams and Clay shared similar views on national issues. By contrast, Clay viewed Jackson as a dangerous demagogue, and he was unwilling to support Crawford due to the latter's health issues. Adams and Clay met before the contingent election, and Clay agreed to support Adams in the election. Adams also met with Federalists such as Daniel Webster, promising that he would not deny governmental positions to members of their party. On February 9, 1825, Adams won the contingent election on the first ballot, taking 13 of the 24 state delegations. Adams won the House delegations of all the states in which he or Clay had won a majority of the electoral votes, as well as the delegations of Illinois, Louisiana, and Maryland. Adams's victory made him the first child of a president to serve as president himself. After the election, many of Jackson's supporters claimed that Adams and Clay had reached a \"Corrupt Bargain\" whereby Adams promised Clay the position of Secretary of State in return for Clay's support."

Adams's first choices for Secretary of War and Secretary of the Treasury were Andrew Jackson and William Crawford, but each declined to serve in the administration. Adams instead selected James Barbour of Virginia, a prominent supporter of Crawford, to lead the War Department. Leadership of the Treasury Department went to Richard Rush of Pennsylvania, who would become a prominent advocate of internal improvements and protective tariffs within the administration. Adams chose Henry Clay as Secretary of State, angering those who believed that Clay had offered his support in the 1824 election for the most prestigious position in the cabinet. Though Clay would later regret accepting the position since it reinforced the \"Corrupt Bargain\" accusation, Clay's strength in the West and interest in foreign policy made him a natural choice for the top cabinet position."

        "content": "In his 1825 annual message to Congress, Adams presented a comprehensive and ambitious agenda. He called for major investments in internal improvements as well as the creation of a national university, a naval academy, and a national astronomical observatory. Noting the healthy status of the treasury and the possibility for more revenue via land sales, Adams argued for the completion of several projects that were in various stages of construction or planning, including a road from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans. He also proposed the establishment of a Department of the Interior as a new cabinet-level department that would preside over these internal improvements. Adams hoped to fund these measures primarily through Western land sales, rather than increased taxes or public debt. The domestic agenda of Adams and Clay, which would come to be known as the American System, was designed to unite disparate regional interests in the promotion of a thriving national economy. Adams's programs faced opposition from various quarters. Many disagreed with his broad interpretation of the constitution and preferred that power be concentrated in state governments rather than the federal government. Others disliked interference from any level of government and were opposed to central planning. Some in the South feared that Adams was secretly an abolitionist and that he sought to subordinate the states to the federal government. Most of the president's proposals were defeated in Congress. Adams's ideas for a national university, a national observatory, and the establishment of a uniform system of weights and measures never received congressional votes. His proposal for the creation of a naval academy won the approval of the Senate but was defeated in the House; opponents objected to the naval academy's cost and worried that the establishment of such an institution would \"produce degeneracy and corruption of the public morality\". Adams's proposal to establish a national bankruptcy law was also defeated. Unlike other aspects of his domestic agenda, Adams won congressional approval for several ambitious infrastructure projects. Between 1824 and 1828, the United States Army Corps of Engineers conducted surveys for a bevy of potential roads, canals, railroads, and improvements in river navigation. Adams presided over major repairs and further construction on the National Road, and shortly after he left office the National Road extended from Cumberland, Maryland, to Zanesville, Ohio. The Adams administration also saw the beginning of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal; the construction of the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal and the Louisville and Portland Canal around the Falls of the Ohio; the connection of the Great Lakes to the Ohio River system in Ohio and Indiana; and the enlargement and rebuilding of the Dismal Swamp Canal in North Carolina. Additionally, the first passenger railroad in the United States, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, was constructed during Adams's presidency. Though many of these projects were undertaken by private actors, the government often provided money or land to aid the completion of such projects."

        "content": "In the immediate aftermath of the 1825 contingent election, Jackson was gracious to Adams. Nevertheless, Adams's appointment of Clay rankled Jackson, who received a flood of letters encouraging him to run. In 1825, Jackson accepted the presidential nomination of the Tennessee legislature for the 1828 election. Though he had been close to Adams during Monroe's presidency, Vice President Calhoun was also politically alienated from the president by the appointment of Clay, since that appointment established Clay as the natural heir to Adams. Adams's ambitious December 1825 annual message to Congress further galvanized the opposition, with important figures such as Francis Preston Blair of Kentucky and Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri breaking with the Adams administration. By the end of the first session of the 19th United States Congress, an anti-Adams congressional coalition consisting of Jacksonians (led by Benton and Hugh Lawson White), Crawfordites (led by Martin Van Buren and Nathaniel Macon), and Calhounites (led by Robert Y. Hayne and George McDuffie) had emerged. Aside from Clay, Adams lacked strong supporters outside of the North, and Edward Everett, John Taylor, and Daniel Webster served as his strongest advocates in Congress. Supporters of Adams began calling themselves National Republicans, while supporters of Jackson began calling themselves Democrats. In the press, they were often described as \"Adams Men\" and \"Jackson Men\". In the 1826 elections, Adams's opponents picked up seats throughout the country, as allies of Adams failed to coordinate among themselves. Andrew Stevenson, a Jackson supporter, replaced John Taylor, an Adams supporter, as Speaker of the House. As Adams himself noted, the United States had never seen a Congress that was firmly under the control of political opponents of the president. After the elections, Van Buren and Calhoun agreed to throw their support behind Jackson in 1828, with Van Buren bringing along many of Crawford's supporters. Though Jackson did not articulate a detailed political platform in the same way that Adams did, his coalition united in opposition to Adams's reliance on government planning. Adams, meanwhile, clung to the hope of a non-partisan nation, and he refused to make full use of the power of patronage to build up his own party structure."

After Jacksonians took power in 1827, they devised a tariff bill designed to appeal to Western states while instituting high rates on imported materials important to the economy of New England. It is unclear whether Van Buren, who shepherded the bill through Congress, meant for the bill to pass, or if he had deliberately designed it to force Adams and his allies to oppose it. Regardless, Adams signed the Tariff of 1828, which became known as the \"Tariff of Abominations\" by opponents. Adams was denounced in the South, and he received little credit for the tariff in the North."

Yet Adams was also deeply committed to the westward expansion of the United States. Settlers on the frontier, constantly seeking to move westward, cried for a more expansionist policy that disregarded the concerns of Native Americans. Early in his term, Adams suspended the Treaty of Indian Springs after learning that the Governor of Georgia, George Troup, had forced the treaty on the Muscogee. Adams signed a new treaty with the Muscogee in January 1826 that allowed the Muscogee to stay but ceded most of their land to Georgia. Troup refused to accept its terms and authorized all Georgian citizens to evict the Muscogee. A showdown between Georgia and the federal government was only averted after the Muscogee agreed to a third treaty. Though many saw Troup as unreasonable in his dealings with the federal government and the Native Americans, the administration's handling of the incident alienated those in the Deep South who favored immediate Indian removal."

The administration also reached commercial agreements with the Kingdom of Hawaii and the Kingdom of Tahiti. Agreements with Denmark and Sweden opened their colonies to American trade, but Adams was especially focused on opening trade with the British West Indies. The United States had reached a commercial agreement with Britain in 1815, but that agreement excluded British possessions in the Western Hemisphere. In response to United States pressure, the British had begun to allow a limited amount of American imports to the West Indies in 1823, but United States leaders continued to seek an end to Britain's protective Imperial Preference system. In 1825, Britain banned United States trade with the British West Indies, dealing a blow to Adams's prestige. The Adams administration negotiated extensively with the British to lift this ban, but the two sides could not reach an agreement. Despite the loss of trade with the British West Indies, the other commercial agreements secured by Adams helped expand the overall volume of United States exports."

Adams and Clay instead sought engagement with Latin America to prevent it from falling under the British Empire's economic influence. As part of this goal, the administration favored sending a United States delegation to the Congress of Panama, an 1826 conference of New World republics organized by Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. Clay and Adams hoped that the conference would inaugurate a \"Good Neighborhood Policy\" among the independent states of the Americas. However, the funding for a delegation and the confirmation of delegation nominees became entangled in a political battle over Adams's domestic policies, with opponents such as Van Buren impeding the confirmation of a delegation. While Van Buren saw the Panama Congress as an unwelcome deviation from the more isolationist foreign policy established by President Washington, many Southerners opposed involvement with any conference attended by delegates from Haiti, a republic that had been established through a slave revolt. Though the United States delegation finally won confirmation from the Senate, it never reached the Congress of Panama due to the Senate's delay."

        "content": "The Jacksonians formed an effective party apparatus that adopted many modern campaign techniques. Rather than focusing on issues, they emphasized Jackson's popularity and the supposed corruption of Adams and the federal government. Jackson himself described the campaign as a \"struggle between the virtue of the people and executive patronage\". Adams, meanwhile, refused to adapt to the new reality of political campaigns, and he avoided public functions and refused to invest in pro-administration tools such as newspapers. In early 1827, Jackson was publicly accused of having encouraged his wife, Rachel, to desert her first husband. In response, followers of Jackson attacked Adams's personal life, and the campaign turned increasingly nasty. The Jacksonian press portrayed Adams as an out-of-touch elitist, while pro-Adams newspapers attacked Jackson's past involvement in various duels and scuffles, portraying him as too emotional and impetuous for the presidency. Though Adams and Clay had hoped that the campaign would focus on the American System, it was instead dominated by the personalities of Jackson and Adams. Vice President Calhoun joined Jackson's ticket, while Adams turned to Secretary of the Treasury Richard Rush as his running mate. The 1828 election thus marked the first time in United States history that a presidential ticket composed of two Northerners faced off against a presidential ticket composed of two Southerners. In the election, Jackson won 178 of the 261 electoral votes and just under 56% of the popular vote. Jackson won 50.3% of the popular vote in the free states, but 72.6% of the vote in the slave states. No future presidential candidate would match Jackson's proportion of the popular vote until Theodore Roosevelt's 1904 campaign, while Adams's loss made him the second one-term president, after his own father. By 1828, only two states did not hold a popular vote for president, and the number of votes in the 1828 election was triple that in the 1824 election. This increase in votes was due not only to the recent wave of democratization, but also because of increased interest in elections and the growing ability of the parties to mobilize voters. Adams did not attend Jackson's inauguration, making him one of only four presidents who finished their terms but skipped the event."

        "content": "Adams considered permanently retiring from public life after his 1828 defeat, and he was deeply hurt by the suicide of his son, George Washington Adams, in 1829. He was appalled by many of the Jackson administration's actions, including its embrace of the spoils system and the prosecution of his close friend, Treasury Auditor Tobias Watkins, for embezzlement. Though they had once maintained a cordial relationship, Adams and Jackson each came to loathe the other in the decades after the 1828 election. Adams grew bored with his retirement and still felt that his career was unfinished, so he ran for and won a seat in the United States House of Representatives in the 1830 elections. His election went against the generally held opinion, shared by his own wife and youngest son, that former presidents should not run for public office. Nonetheless, he would win election to nine terms, serving from 1831 until his death in 1848. Adams and Andrew Johnson are the only former presidents to serve in Congress. After winning election, Adams became affiliated with the Anti-Masonic Party, partly because the National Republican Party's leadership in Massachusetts included many of the former Federalists that Adams had clashed with earlier in his career. The Anti-Masonic Party originated as a movement against Freemasonry, but it developed into the country's first third party and embraced a general program of anti-elitism. Adams expected a light workload when he returned to Washington at 64 years old, but Speaker Andrew Stevenson selected Adams chair of the Committee on Commerce and Manufactures. Though he identified as a member of the Anti-Masonic Party, Congress was broadly polarized into allies of Jackson and opponents of Jackson, and Adams generally aligned with the latter camp. Stevenson, an ally of Jackson, expected that the committee chairmanship would keep Adams busy defending the tariff even while the Jacksonian majority on the committee would prevent Adams from accruing any real power. As chair of the committee charged with writing tariff laws, Adams became an important player in the Nullification crisis, which stemmed largely from Southern objections to the high rates imposed by the Tariff of 1828. South Carolina leaders argued that states could nullify federal laws, and they announced that the they would bar the federal government from enforcing the tariff in their state. Adams helped pass the Tariff of 1832, which lowered rates, but not enough to mollify the South Carolina nullifiers. The crisis ended when Clay and Calhoun agreed to another tariff bill, the Tariff of 1833, that furthered lower tariff rates. Adams was appalled by the Nullification Crisis's outcome, as he felt that the Southern states had unfairly benefited from challenging federal law. After the crisis, Adams was convinced that Southerners exercised undue influence over the federal governmen through their control of Jackson's Democratic Party. In the 1833 Massachusetts gubernatorial election, the Anti-Masonic Party nominated Adams in a four-way race between Adams, the National Republican candidate, the Democratic candidate, and a candidate of the Working Men's Party. The National Republican candidate, John Davis, won 40% of the vote, while Adams finished in second place with 29%. Because no candidate won a majority of the vote, the state legislature decided the election. Rather than seek election by the legislature, Adams withdrew his name from contention, and the legislature selected Davis. Adams was nearly elected to the Senate in 1835 by a coalition of Anti-Masons and National Republicans, but his support for Jackson in a minor foreign policy matter annoyed National Republican leaders enough that they dropped their support for his candidacy. After 1835, Adams never again sought higher office, focusing instead on his service in the House of Representatives."

        "content": "In the mid-1830s, the Anti-Masonic Party, the National Republicans, and other groups opposed to Jackson coalesced into the Whig Party. In the 1836 presidential election Democrats put forward Martin Van Buren, while the Whigs fielded multiple presidential candidates. Because he disdained all the major party contenders for president, Adams did not take part in the campaign; Van Buren won the election. Nonetheless, Adams became aligned with the Whig Party in Congress. Adams generally opposed the initiatives of President Van Buren, long a political adversary, though they maintained a cordial public relationship. The Republic of Texas won its independence from Mexico in the Texas Revolution of 1835\u20131836. Texas had largely been settled by Americans from the Southern United States, and many of those settlers owned slaves despite an 1829 Mexican law that abolished slavery. Many in the United States and Texas thus favored the admission of Texas into the union as a slave state. Adams considered the issue of Texas to be \"a question of far deeper root and more overshadowing branches than any or all others that agitate the country\", and he emerged as one of the leading congressional opponents of annexation.  When he served as secretary of state, Adams had sought to acquire Texas, but he argued that, because Mexico had abolished slavery, the acquisition of Texas would transform the region from a free territory into a slave state. He also feared that the annexation of Texas would encourage Southern expansionists to pursue other potential slave states, including Cuba. Adams's firm stance may have played a role in discouraging Van Buren from pushing for the annexation of Texas during his presidency. Whig nominee William Henry Harrison defeated Van Buren in the 1840 presidential election, and the Whigs gained control of both houses of Congress for the first time. Despite his low regard for Harrison as a person, Adams was enthusiastic about the new Whig administration and the end of the long-standing Democratic dominance of the federal government. However, Harrison died in April 1841 and was succeeded by Vice President John Tyler, a Southerner who, unlike Adams, Henry Clay, and many other prominent Whigs, did not embrace the American System. Adams saw Tyler as an agent of \"the slave-driving, Virginia, Jeffersonian school, principled against all improvement\". After Tyler vetoed a bill to restore the national bank, Whig congressmen expelled Tyler from the party. Adams was appointed chairman of a special committee that explored impeaching Tyler, and Adams presented a scathing report of Tyler that argued that his actions warranted impeachment. The impeachment process did not move forward, though, because the Whigs did not believe that the Senate would vote to remove Tyler from office."

        "content": "Tyler made the annexation of Texas the main foreign policy priority of the later stages of his administration. He attempted to win ratification of an annexation treaty in 1844, but, to Adams's surprise and relief, the Senate rejected the treaty. The annexation of Texas became the central issue of the 1844 presidential election, and Southerners blocked the nomination of Van Buren at the 1844 Democratic National Convention due to the latter's opposition to annexation; the party instead nominated James K. Polk, an acolyte of Andrew Jackson. Though he once again did not take part in the campaigning, Adams was deeply disappointed that Polk defeated his old ally, Henry Clay, in the 1844 election. He attributed the outcome of the election partly to the Liberty Party, a small, abolitionist third party that may have siphoned votes from Clay in the crucial state of New York. After the election, Tyler, whose term would end in March 1845, once again submitted an annexation treaty to Congress. Adams strongly attacked the treaty, arguing that the annexation of Texas would involve the United States in \"a war for slavery\". Despite Adams's opposition, both houses of Congress approved the treaty, with most Democrats voting for annexation and most Whigs voting against it. Texas thus joined the United States as a slave state in 1845. Adams had served with James K. Polk in the House of Representatives, and Adams loathed the new president, seeing him as another expansionist, pro-slavery Southern Democrat. Adams favored the annexation of the entirety of Oregon Country, a disputed region occupied by both the United States and Britain, and was disappointed when President Polk signed the Oregon Treaty, which divided the land between the two claimants at the 49th parallel. Polk's expansionist aims centered instead on the Mexican province of Alta California, and he attempted to buy the province from Mexico. The Mexican government refused to sell California or recognize the independence and subsequent American annexation of Texas. Polk deployed a military detachment led by General Zachary Taylor to back up his assertion that the Rio Grande constituted the Southern border of both Texas and the United States. After Taylor's forces clashed with Mexican soldiers north of the Rio Grande, Polk asked for a declaration of war in early 1846, asserting that Mexico had invaded American territory. Though some Whigs questioned whether Mexico had started an aggressive war, both houses of Congress declared war, with the House voting 174-to-14 to approve the declaration. One of the 14 dissenting votes was Adams, who believed that Polk was seeking to wage an offensive to expand slavery. After the start of the war, he supported the Wilmot Proviso, an unsuccessful legislative proposal that would have banned slavery in any territory ceded by Mexico. After 1846, ill health increasingly affected Adams, but he continued to oppose the Mexican\u2013American War until his death in 1848."

A longtime opponent of slavery, Adams used his new role in Congress to fight it, and he became the most prominent national leader opposing slavery. After one of his reelection victories, he said that he must \"bring about a day prophesied when slavery and war shall be banished from the face of the Earth\". He wrote in his private journal in 1820: In 1836, partially in response to Adams's consistent presentation of citizen petitions requesting the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, the House of Representatives imposed a \"gag rule\" that immediately tabled any petitions about slavery. Democrats and Southern Whigs favored the rule, but Northern Whigs, like Adams, opposed it. In late 1836, Adams began a campaign to ridicule slave owners and the gag rule. He frequently attempted to present anti-slavery petitions, often in ways that provoked strong reactions from Southern representatives. Though the gag rule remained in place, the discussion ignited by his actions and the attempts of others to quiet him raised questions of the right to petition, the right to legislative debate, and the morality of slavery. Adams fought actively against the gag rule for another seven years, eventually moving the resolution that led to its repeal in 1844. In 1841, at the request of Lewis Tappan and Ellis Gray Loring, Adams joined the case of United States v. The Amistad. Adams went before the Supreme Court on behalf of African slaves who had revolted and seized the Spanish ship Amistad. Adams appeared on February 24, 1841, and spoke for four hours. His argument succeeded: the Court ruled that the Africans were free and they returned to their homes."

In Smithson's will, he stated that should his nephew, Henry James Hungerford, die without heirs, the Smithson estate would go to the government of the United States to create an \"Establishment for the increase and diffusion of Knowledge among men\". After the nephew died without heirs in 1835, President Andrew Jackson informed Congress of the bequest, which amounted to about US$500,000 (US$75 million in 2008 dollars after inflation). Adams realized that this might allow the United States to realize his dream of building a national institution of science and learning. Adams thus became Congress's primary supporter of the future Smithsonian Institution. The money was invested in shaky state bonds, which quickly defaulted. After heated debate in Congress, Adams successfully argued to restore the lost funds with interest. Though Congress wanted to use the money for other purposes, Adams successfully persuaded Congress to preserve the money for an institution of science and learning. Congress also debated whether the federal government had the authority to accept the gift, though with Adams leading the initiative, Congress accepted the legacy bequeathed to the nation and pledged the faith of the United States to the charitable trust on July 1, 1836. Partly due to Adams's efforts, Congress voted to establish the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. A nonpolitical board of regents was established to lead the institution, which included a museum, art gallery, library, and laboratory."

On February 21, 1848, the House of Representatives was discussing the matter of honoring United States Army officers who served in the Mexican\u2013American War. Adams had been a vehement critic of the war, and as Congressmen rose up to say, \"Aye!\" in favor of the measure, he instead yelled, \"No!\" He rose to answer a question put forth by Speaker of the House Robert Charles Winthrop. Immediately thereafter, Adams collapsed, having suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Two days later, on February 23, he died at 7:20\u00a0p.m. with his wife at his side in the Speaker's Room inside the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.; his only living child, Charles Francis, did not arrive in time to see his father alive.

He always preferred solitary reading to social engagements, and he was repeatedly persuaded to stay in public service by others. Historian Paul Nagel states that, like Abraham Lincoln after him, Adams often suffered from depression, for which he sought treatment in early years. Adams thought his depression was due to the high expectations demanded of him by his father and mother. Throughout his life, he felt inadequate and socially awkward because of his depression, and was constantly bothered by his physical appearance. He was closer to his father, with whom he spent much of his early life with abroad, than he was to his mother. In his youth, while the American Revolution raged on, Adams heard from his mother about his father's work and the substantial risks he took to support it. As a result, he developed a deep respect for his father. In contrast, Adams had a rocky relationship with his mother, due to her high expectations of him, and her fear that her children would follow in the footsteps of her brother, who died of alcoholism. His biographer, Nagel, concludes that his mother's disapproval of Louisa Johnson motivated him to marry Johnson in 1797, despite Adams's reservations that Johnson, like his mother, had a forceful personality. Though Adams wore a powdered wig in his youth, he abandoned this fashion and became the first president to adopt a short haircut instead of long hair tied in a queue and to regularly wear long trousers instead of knee breeches. It has been suggested that John Quincy Adams had the highest I.Q. of any U.S. president. Dean Simonton, a professor of psychology at UC Davis, estimated his I.Q. score at 165. He reportedly spoke eight foreign languages (English, Latin, Greek, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Russian)."

Adams is remembered as a man eminently qualified for the presidency, yet hopelessly weakened in his presidential leadership potential because of the 1824 election. Most importantly, Adams is remembered as a poor politician in an era when politics had begun to matter more. He spoke of trying to serve as a man above the \"baneful weed of party strife\" at the precise moment in history when the Second Party System was emerging with nearly revolutionary force. Biographer and historian William J. Cooper notes that Adams \"does not loom large in the American imagination\", but that he has received more public attention since the late 20th century due to his anti-slavery stances. Cooper writes that Adams was the first \"major public figure\" to publicly question whether the United States could remain united so long as the institution of slavery persisted. Historian Daniel Walker Howe writes that Adams's \"intellectual ability and courage were above reproach, and his wisdom in perceiving the national interest has stood the test of time\". Historians have often included Adams among the leading conservatives of his day. Russell Kirk, however, sees Adams as a flawed conservative and imprudent in opposing slavery. He has also been praised as a strong prose stylist, with James Parker describing him as one of the \"three authentically muddy-eyed and pained-by-subjectivity writers\" that the White House has harbored, along with Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama."

Adams House, one of twelve undergraduate residential Houses at Harvard University, is named for John Adams, John Quincy Adams, and other members of the Adams family associated with Harvard. John Quincy Adams tower is named for the president and resides in the South West residential area of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In 1870, Charles Francis built the first presidential library in the United States, to honor his father. The Stone Library includes over 14,000 books written in twelve languages. The library is located at Peacefield (the \"Old House\") at Adams National Historical Park in Quincy, Massachusetts. Adams's middle name of Quincy has been used by several locations in the United States, including the town of Quincy, Illinois. Adams County, Illinois and Adams County, Indiana are also named after Adams. Adams County, Iowa, and Adams County, Wisconsin, were each named for either John Adams or John Quincy Adams. Some sources contend that in 1843 Adams sat for the earliest confirmed photograph of a United States president, although others maintain that William Henry Harrison had posed even earlier for his portrait, in 1841. The original daguerreotype is in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution."

He also made contributions to many branches of recreational mathematics, most notably the invention of the cellular automaton called the Game of Life. Born and raised in Liverpool, Conway spent the first half of his career at the University of Cambridge before moving to the United States, where he held the John von Neumann Professorship at Princeton University for the rest of his career. On 11 April 2020, at age 82, he died of complications from COVID-19."

        "content": "Conway was born on 26 December 1937 in Liverpool, the son of Cyril Horton Conway and Agnes Boyce. He became interested in mathematics at a very early age. By the time he was 11, his ambition was to become a mathematician. After leaving sixth form, he studied mathematics at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. A \"terribly introverted adolescent\" in school, he took his admission to Cambridge as an opportunity to transform himself into an extrovert, a change which would later earn him the nickname of \"the world's most charismatic mathematician\". Conway was awarded a BA in 1959 and, supervised by Harold Davenport, began to undertake research in number theory. Having solved the open problem posed by Davenport on writing numbers as the sums of fifth powers, Conway began to become interested in infinite ordinals. It appears that his interest in games began during his years studying the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, where he became an avid backgammon player, spending hours playing the game in the common room. He was awarded his doctorate in 1964 and was appointed as College Fellow and Lecturer in Mathematics at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. After leaving Cambridge in 1986, he took up the appointment to the John von Neumann Chair of Mathematics at Princeton University."

His initial experiments in that field were done with pen and paper, long before personal computers existed. Since the game was introduced by Martin Gardner in Scientific American in 1970, it has spawned hundreds of computer programs, web sites, and articles. It is a staple of recreational mathematics. There is an extensive wiki devoted to curating and cataloging the various aspects of the game. From the earliest days, it has been a favorite in computer labs, both for its theoretical interest and as a practical exercise in programming and data display. Conway used to hate the Game of Life\u2014largely because it had come to overshadow some of the other deeper and more important things he has done. Nevertheless, the game did help launch a new branch of mathematics, the field of cellular automata. The Game of Life is known to be Turing complete."

        "content": "Conway's career was intertwined with that of mathematics popularizer and Scientific American columnist Martin Gardner. When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his Mathematical Games column in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity. Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work. For instance, he discussed Conway's game of Sprouts (Jul 1967), Hackenbush (Jan 1972), and his angel and devil problem (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book On Numbers and Games and even managed to explain Conway's surreal numbers. Conway was a prominent member of Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine. He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the Penrose tilings which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings. Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column. The cover of that issue of Scientific American features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway. Conferences called Gathering 4 Gardner are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics."

He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the Soma cube, peg solitaire, and Conway's soldiers. He came up with the angel problem, which was solved in 2006. He invented a new system of numbers, the surreal numbers, which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by Donald Knuth. He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly large numbers, the Conway chained arrow notation. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ONAG."

Lombardero's 1968 Princeton Senior Thesis, which distinguished this one, but not the other, from all others, based on its Alexander polynomial].) The Conway knot is named after him."

This work made him a key player in the successful classification of the finite simple groups. Based on a 1978 observation by mathematician John McKay, Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as monstrous moonshine. This subject, named by Conway, relates the monster group with elliptic modular functions, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014finite groups and complex function theory. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to string theory. Conway introduced the Mathieu groupoid, an extension of the Mathieu group M12 to 13 points."

His 1890 masterpiece Cavalleria rusticana caused one of the greatest sensations in opera history and single-handedly ushered in the Verismo movement in Italian dramatic music. While it was often held that Mascagni, like Ruggiero Leoncavallo, was a \"one-opera man\" who could never repeat his first success, L'amico Fritz and Iris have remained in the repertoire in Europe (especially Italy) since their premieres. Mascagni wrote fifteen operas, an operetta, several orchestral and vocal works, and also songs and piano music.

In 1876, at the age of 13, Mascagni began musical studies with Alfredo Soffredini, who founded the Instituto Musicale di Livorno (later called Istituto Cherubini). Soffredini had just completed his musical studies in Milan. Also a native of Livorno, Soffredini was a composer, teacher and musical critic. Mascagni started composing rapidly: between 1879 and 1880, he wrote several works: Sinfonia in do minore, Prima sinfonia in fa maggiore, Elegia, Kyrie, Gloria and Ave Maria."

Performed at a musical contest in Milan, the cantata won the first prize. In the same year Mascagni met the musicians Arrigo Boito and Amilcare Ponchielli in Milan. In 1882, he composed his Cantata alla gioia from a text by Friedrich Schiller, followed by La stella di Garibaldi for voice and piano, and La tua stella. On 6 May Mascagni left Livorno for Milan.  He passed the admission examination of the Milan Conservatory on 12 October. In Milan, Mascagni met the noted composer Giacomo Puccini. On 9 January 1883, Mascagni's sister, Maria, died. The cantata In Filanda became Pinotta, and was proposed for the musical contest of the Conservatorio, but as his registration was late, it was not accepted. In 1884, he composed Ballata for tenor and piano; M'ama non m'ama, scherzo for soprano and piano; Messagio d'amore, and Alla luna. In 1885, Mascagni composed Il Re a Napoli in Cremona, a romance for tenor and orchestra, on a text by Andrea Maffei.  He left Milan without completing his studies. That year, he began touring as a conductor in the operetta companies of Vittorio Forl\u00ec, Alfonso and Ciro Scognamiglio, and, in Genoa, the company of Luigi Arnaldo Vassallo. Mascagni met the impresario Luigi Maresca in 1886 and started working with him. That December, Mascagni arrived in Cerignola with Maresca's company. He was accompanied by Argenide Marcellina Carbognani (Lina), his future wife. Helped by the mayor Giuseppe Cannone, Mascagni soon left the company of Maresca, though not without problems. He was appointed as the master of music and singing of the new philharmonia of Cerignola. His reputation grew. He also gave piano lessons. In February 1888, he began work on the Messa di Gloria. In July, Casa Sonzogno announced in the Teatro Illustrato its second competition for a one-act opera. The following year, Mascagni completed his composition of Cavalleria rusticana on 27 May and sent the manuscript to Milan. Mascagni married Lina Carbognani on 3 February 1889. The next day their first son, Domenico Mascagni (\"Mim\u00ec\"), was born. Their son Dino was born on 3 January 1891. A daughter, Emi, was born in 1892."

It had outstanding success, and the opera was soon performed in both the north and south of Italy: Florence, Turin, Bologna, Palermo, Milan, Genoa, Naples, Venice and Trieste. In December, Gustav Mahler conducted the opera in Budapest. Soon thereafter, the cities of Munich, Hamburg, St. Petersburg, Dresden and Buenos Aires welcomed the opera. In March 1891, it was sung in Vienna. At age 26, Mascagni had become internationally famous. Mascagni premiered his L'amico Fritz, his second most successful opera, on 31 October 1891 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. I Rantzau was premiered on 10 November at the Teatro La Pergola, in Florence, under his personal direction. The composer next completed Silvano  (1894). On 16 February 1895 he premiered  Guglielmo Ratcliff at the Teatro alla Scala of Milan. On 15 March Silvano was premiered at the same theatre. That year, Mascagni accepted the directorship of the Liceo Rossini in Pesaro and moved his family there. On 2 March 1896, Mascagni conducted the premi\u00e8re of Zanetto at the Liceo. He continued his composing and directing. On 29 June 1898 in Recanati, Mascagni conducted the premi\u00e8re of a symphonic poem, A Giacomo Leopardi.

The tour was mostly a fiasco, except for the visit to San Francisco where Mascagni was extremely well received. In 1903, Mascagni left Pesaro after problems with the authorities. He became director of the Scuola Musicale Romana, in Rome. In the same year he signed a contract with the French editor Paul de Choudens. Amica, based on a poem by Choudens with French libretto by Paul Collin, was premiered on 16 March 1905, in Monte-Carlo. That year, he had disputes with Ruggiero Leoncavallo and Giacomo Puccini. He also had the Livornese premi\u00e8re of Le maschere. Mascagni was director of the Costanzi for the season beginning in August 1909."

Mascagni ceased his activity as director of the Scuola Musicale Romana in 1911. That May he left for Buenos Aires, beginning a seven-month tour in South America. The premi\u00e8re of Isabeau took place in Buenos Aires on 2 June. The Italian premi\u00e8re of Isabeau was held simultaneously at La Scala in Milan (conductor Tullio Serafin) and at La Fenice in Venice (conductor Mascagni) in 1912. On 28 March, he began to work on Parisina in Bellevue, near Paris, sometimes with his daughter Emi, his mistress Anna Lolli, and the librettist Gabriele d'Annunzio. Parisina was premiered in Milan on 15 December of that year. Almost all the important Italian composers of the time were present, among them Puccini, Umberto Giordano and Riccardo Zandonai. The new work was premiered in Livorno and Rome in 1914. On 28 July occurred the events that shortly led to World War I: Puccini and Mascagni were against the involvement of Italy in this war, in which Mascagni's son Dino was later made a prisoner. In 1915 Mascagni wrote music for Nino Oxilia's movie Rapsodia Satanica; the custom was for silent films to be accompanied live in a theater by organ, piano, or an orchestra, often using a prepared score (sometimes with original music) with cues for the conductor or musician. Mascagni had a quarrel regarding the rights of Louise de la Ram\u00e9e's Two Little Wooden Shoes (I due Zoccoletti), that inspired both Puccini and Mascagni. The subject was retained by Mascagni for Lodoletta. The latter opera was premiered on 30 April 1917 in Rome.  The Livornese premi\u00e8re of the opera was on 28 July with Beniamino Gigli as Flammen. S\u00ec, Mascagni's operetta, which he had been manoeuvred into writing by the impresario Carlo Lombardo, was premiered on 13 December in Rome."

The opera was recorded for La Voce del padrone (\"His Master's Voice\") at La Scala under the direction of Mascagni, who recorded a special spoken introduction. EMI later reissued the recording on LP and CD. In 1942, after an audience with Pope Pius XII, newspapers quoted Mascagni, a Roman Catholic, as saying that his tuberculosis-stricken niece was cured after receiving a rosary and silver medal blessed by the pope. In April 1943, Mascagni appeared for the last time at La Scala to conduct L'amico Fritz. By that time he had to conduct sitting on a chair. The last season of Mascagni at the Rome Opera (Cavalleria rusticana and L'amico Fritz) was 1944\u201345. Mascagni died on 2 August 1945 in his apartment at the Grand Hotel Plaza in Rome. The funeral ceremony was on 4 August.  The Italian authorities were not present. In 1951, his body was transferred from Rome to Livorno, where Mascagni finally received an official homage. On 7 December 1963, the centenary of Mascagni's birth, a plaque was erected in Rome on the Albergo del Sole where Mascagni stayed during the premiere of Cavalleria rusticana."

He published on a diverse range of subjects, and from multiple views as his perspective changed over the years. Among his students was Alexander Luria and Kharkiv school of psychology. He is known for his concept of the zone of proximal development (ZPD): the distance between what a student (apprentice, new employee, etc.) can do on their own, and what they can accomplish with the support of someone more knowledgeable about the activity. Vygotsky saw the ZPD as a measure of skills that are in the process of maturing, as supplement to measures of development that only look at a learner's independent ability. Also influential are his works on the relationship between language and thought, the development of language, and a general theory of development through actions and relationships in a socio-cultural environment. Vygotsky is the subject of great scholarly dispute. There is a group of scholars who see parts of Vygotsky's current legacy as distortions and who are going back to Vygotsky's manuscripts in an attempt to make Vygotsky's legacy more true to his actual ideas."

        "content": "Despite his claim for a \"new psychology\" that he foresaw as a \"science of the Superman\" of the Communist future, Vygotsky's main work was in developmental psychology. In order to fully understand the human mind, he believed one must understand its genesis. Consequently, the majority of his work involved the study of infant and child behavior, as well as the development of language acquisition (such as the importance of pointing and inner speech) and the development of concepts; now often referred to as schemas or schemata. Early in the psychological research period of his career (1920s), which focused upon mechanistic and reductionist \"instrumental psychology\" in many ways inspired by the work of Ivan Pavlov (his theory of \"higher nervous activity\") and Vladimir Bekhterev (and his \"reflexologist\" followers), Vygotsky argued that human psychological development could be formed through the use of meaningless (i.e., virtually random) signs that he viewed as the psychological equivalent of instrument use in human labor and industry. It was later during the \"holistic\" period of his career (the first half of the 1930s) that Vygotsky rejected this earlier reductionist views on signs. While Vygotsky never met Jean Piaget, he had read a number of his works and agreed on some of his perspectives on learning. At some point (around 1929\u201330), Vygotsky came to disagree with Piaget's understanding of learning and development, and held a different theoretical position from Piaget on the topic of inner speech; Piaget asserted that egocentric speech in children \"dissolved away\" as they matured, while Vygotsky maintained that egocentric speech became internalized, what we now call \"inner speech\". However, in the early 1930s he radically changed his mind on Piaget's theory and openly praised him for his discovery of the social origin of children's speech, reasoning, and moral judgements. Piaget only read Vygotsky's work after his death. Nearing the end of his life, Vygotsky's later work involved adolescent development. However, his most important and widely known contribution is his theory for the development of \"higher psychological functions,\" which considers human psychological development as emerging through unification of interpersonal connections and actions taken within a given socio-cultural environment (i.e., language, culture, society, and tool-use). Vygotsky eventually came to dialogue with the mainstream Gestalt line of thought and adopted a more holistic approach to understanding development. Under the increasing influence of the holistic thinking of the scholars primarily associated with the German-American Gestalt psychology movement, Vygotsky adopted their views on \"psychological systems\" and\u2014inspired by Kurt Lewin's \"topological (and vector) psychology\"\u2014introduced the enigmatic construct of the \"zone of proximal development\". It was during this period that he identified the play of young children as their \"leading activity\", which he understood to be the main source of preschoolers' psychological development, and which he viewed as an expression of an inseparable unity of emotional, volitional, and cognitive development. At this time, Vygotsky fully revealed his long-time interest in the philosophy of Spinoza, who would remain one of his favorite thinkers throughout his life. A fervent Spinozist in many respects, Vygotsky was profoundly influenced by Spinoza's thought, largely in response to Spinoza's examinations concerning human emotion. As his work matured, Spinoza's thought became a more central visitation in Vygotsky's later work, increasingly focused on the issue of human emotion and its role in higher psychological functions and development that he largely omitted in his earlier work and utterly needed for creating a holistic psychological theory. As early as the mid-1920s, Vygotsky's ideas were introduced in the West, but he remained virtually unknown until the early 1980s when the popularity among educators of the constructivist developmental psychology and educational theory of Jean Piaget (1896-1980) started to decline and, in contrast, Vygotsky's notion of the \"zone of proximal development\" became a central component of the development of \"social constructivist\" turn in developmental and, primarily, educational psychology and practice. A Review of General Psychology study, published in 2002, ranked Vygotsky as the 83rd top psychologist of the twentieth century and the third (and the last) Russian on the top-100 list after Ivan Pavlov and Vygotsky's longtime collaborator Alexander Luria."

        "content": "Lev Semionovich Vygotsky (;  \u2013 June 11, 1934) was born to the Vygodskii family in the town of Orsha, Belarus (then belonging to Russian Empire) into a non-religious middle-class family of Russian Jewish extraction. His father Simkha Vygodskii was a banker. Lev Vygodskii was raised in the city of Gomel, where he was homeschooled until 1911 and then obtained formal degree (with distinction) in a private Jewish Gimnasium, which allowed him entrance to a university. In 1913 Lev Vygodskii was admitted to the Moscow University by mere ballot through a \"Jewish Lottery\": at the time a three percent Jewish student quota was administered for entry in Moscow and Saint Petersburg universities. He had interest in humanities and social sciences, but at the insistence of his parents he applied to the medical school in Moscow University. During the first semester of study he transferred to the law school. There he studied law and, in parallel, he attended lectures at Shaniavskii University. Vygodskii's early interests were in the arts and, primarily, in the topics of the history of the Jewish people, the tradition, culture and Jewish identity. In contrast, during this period he was highly critical of the ideas of both socialism and Zionism, and proposed the solution of the \"Jewish question\" by return to the traditional Jewish Orthodoxy.  His own academics, however, included a wide field of studies including linguistics, psychology, and philosophy. Lev Vygotsky never completed his formal studies at the Imperial Moscow University and, thus, he never obtained a university degree: his studies were interrupted by the October Bolshevik uprising in 1917 in the country's capital Petrograd and the second largest city Moscow. Following these events, he left Moscow and eventually returned to Gomel, where he lived after the October Socialist Revolution of 1917 occurred. There is virtually no information about his life during the years in Gomel (that administratively belonged to the Ukrainian State at the time) after the German occupation during WWI, until the Bolsheviks captured the town in 1919. After that, he was an active participant of major social transformation under the Bolshevik (Communist) rule and a fairly prominent representative of the Bolshevik government in Gomel from 1919 to 1923. By the early 1920s, as reflected in his journalistic publications of the time, he informally changed his Jewish-sounding birth name, 'Lev S\u00edmkhovich V\u00fdgodskii' (), with the surname becoming Vyg\u00f3tskii and the patronymic 'S\u00edmkhovich' becoming the Slavic 'Semi\u00f3novich'. It was under this pen-name that the fame subsequently came to him. His daughters (subsequently born in 1925 and 1930)  and other relatives, though, preserved their original family name 'Vygodskii'. The traditional English spelling of his last name nowadays is 'Vygotsky'. In January 1924, Vygotsky took part in the Second All-Russian Psychoneurological Congress in Petrograd (soon thereafter renamed Leningrad). After the Congress, Vygotsky received an invitation to become a research fellow at the Psychological Institute in Moscow. Vygotsky moved to Moscow with his new wife, Roza Smekhova. He began his career at the Psychological Institute as a \"staff scientist, second class\". He also became a secondary teacher, covering a period marked by his interest in the processes of learning and the role of language in learning. By the end of 1925, Vygotsky completed his dissertation in 1925 entitled \"The Psychology of Art\" that was not published until the 1960s and a book entitled \"Pedagogical Psychology\" that apparently was created on the basis of lecture notes that he prepared in Gomel while he was a psychology instructor at local educational establishments. In the summer of 1925 he made his first and only trip abroad to a London congress on the education of the deaf. Upon return to the Soviet Union, he was hospitalized due to relapse of tuberculosis and, having miraculously survived, would remain an invalid and out of work until the end of 1926. His dissertation was accepted as the prerequisite of scholarly degree, which was awarded to Vygotsky in fall 1925 in absentia. After his release from the hospital, Vygotsky did theoretical and methodological work on the crisis in psychology, but never finished the draft of the manuscript and interrupted his work on it around mid-1927. The manuscript was published later with notable editorial interventions and distortions in 1982 and was presented by the editors as one of the most important of Vygotsky's works. In this early manuscript, Vygotsky argued for the formation of a general psychology that could unite the naturalist objectivist strands of psychological science with the more philosophical approaches of Marxist orientation. However, he also harshly criticized those of his colleagues who attempted to build a \"Marxist Psychology\" as an alternative to the naturalist and philosophical schools. He argued that if one wanted to build a truly Marxist Psychology, there were no shortcuts to be found by merely looking for applicable quotes in the writings of Marx. Rather one should look for a methodology that was in accordance with the Marxian spirit. From 1926 to 1930, Vygotsky worked on a research program investigating the development of higher cognitive functions of logical memory, selective attention, decision making, and language comprehension, from early forms of primal psychological functions. During this period he gathered a group of collaborators including Alexander Luria, Boris Varshava, Alexei Leontiev, Leonid Zankov, and several others. Vygotsky guided his students in researching this phenomenon from three different perspectives: The instrumental approach, which aimed to understand the ways humans use objects as mediation aids in memory and reasoning. A developmental approach, focused on how children acquire higher cognitive functions during development A culture-historical approach, studying how social and cultural patterns of interaction shape forms of mediation and developmental trajectories In the early 1930s, Vygotsky experienced deep crises, both personal and theoretical, and after a period of massive self-criticism, he made an attempt at a radical revision of his theory. The work of the representatives of the Gestalt psychology and other holistic scholars was instrumental in this theoretical shift. In 1932\u20131934, Vygotsky aimed to establish a psychological theory of consciousness, but because of his death, this theory remained only unconfirmed and unfinished."

        "content": "Vygotsky was a pioneering psychologist and his major works span six separate volumes, written over roughly ten years, from Psychology of Art (1925) to Thought and Language [or Thinking and Speech] (1934). Vygotsky's interests in the fields of developmental psychology, child development, and education were extremely diverse. His philosophical framework includes interpretations of the cognitive role of mediation tools, as well as the re-interpretation of well-known concepts in psychology such as internalization of knowledge. Vygotsky introduced the notion of zone of proximal development, a metaphor capable of describing the potential of human cognitive development. His work covered topics such as the origin and the psychology of art, development of higher mental functions, philosophy of science and the methodology of psychological research, the relation between learning and human development, concept formation, interrelation between language and thought development, play as a psychological phenomenon, learning disabilities, and abnormal human development (aka defectology). His scientific thinking underwent several major transformations throughout his career, but generally Vygotsky's legacy may be divided into two fairly distinct periods, and the transitional phase between the two during which Vygotsky experienced the crisis in his theory and personal life. These are the mechanistic \"instrumental\" period of the 1920s, integrative \"holistic\" period of the 1930s, and the transitional years of, roughly, 1929\u20131931. Each of these periods is characterized by its distinct themes and theoretical innovations."

        "content": "Vygotsky studied child development and the significant roles of cultural mediation and interpersonal communication. He observed how higher mental functions developed through these interactions, and also represented the shared knowledge of a culture. This process is known as internalization. Internalization may be understood in one respect as \"knowing how\". For example, the practices of riding a bicycle or pouring a cup of milk, initially, are outside and beyond the child. The mastery of the skills needed for performing these practices occurs through the activity of the child within society. A further aspect of internalization is appropriation, in which children take tools and adapt them to personal use, perhaps using them in unique ways. Internalizing the use of a pencil allows the child to use it very much for personal ends rather than drawing exactly what others in society have drawn previously."

        "content": "In the 1930s, Vygotsky was engaged in massive reconstruction of the theory of his \"instrumental\" period of the 1920s. Around 1929\u20131930, he realized numerous deficiencies and imperfections of the earlier work of the Vygotsky Circle and criticized it on a number of occasions: in 1929, 1930, in 1931, and in 1932. Specifically, Vygotsky criticized his earlier idea of radical separation between the \"lower\" and \"higher\" psychological functions and, around 1932, appears to abandon it. Vygotsky's self-criticism was complemented by external criticism for a number of issues, including the separation between the \"higher\" and the \"lower\" psychological functions, impracticality and inapplicability of his theory in social practices (such as industry or education) during the time of rapid social change, and vulgar Marxist interpretation of human psychological processes. Critics also pointed to his overemphasis on the role of language and, on the other hand, the ignorance of the emotional factors in human development. Major figures in Soviet psychology such as Sergei Rubinstein criticized Vygotsky's notion of mediation and its development in the works of students. Following criticism and in response to a generous offer from the highest officials in Soviet Ukraine, a major group of Vygotsky's associates, the members of the Vygotsky Circle, including Luria, Mark Lebedinsky, and Leontiev, moved from Moscow to Ukraine to establish the Kharkov school of psychology. In the second half of the 1930s, Vygotsky was criticized again for his involvement in the cross-disciplinary study of the child known as paedology and uncritical borrowings from contemporary \"bourgeois\" science. Considerable critique came from alleged followers of Vygotsky, such as Leontiev and members of his research group in Kharkov. Much of this early criticism was later discarded by these Vygotskian scholars as well."

        "content": "\"Zone of Proximal Development\" (ZPD) is a term Vygotsky used to characterize an individual's mental development. He originally defined the ZPD as \u201cthe distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers.\u201d He used the example of two children in school who originally could solve problems at an eight-year-old developmental level (that is, typical for children who were age 8). After each child received assistance from an adult, one was able to perform at a nine-year-old level and one was able to perform at a twelve-year-old level. He said \"This difference between twelve and eight, or between nine and eight, is what we call the zone of proximal development.\" He further said that the ZPD \u201cdefines those functions that have not yet matured but are in the process of maturation, functions that will mature tomorrow but are currently in an embryonic state.\u201d The zone is bracketed by the learner's current ability and the ability they can achieve with the aid of an instructor of some capacity. Vygotsky viewed the ZPD as a better way to explain the relation between children's learning and cognitive development. Prior to the ZPD, the relation between learning and development could be boiled down to the following three major positions: 1) Development always precedes learning (e.g., constructivism): children first need to meet a particular maturation level before learning can occur; 2) Learning and development cannot be separated, but instead occur simultaneously (e.g., behaviorism): essentially, learning is development; and 3) learning and development are separate, but interactive processes (e.g., gestaltism): one process always prepares the other process, and vice versa. Vygotsky rejected these three major theories because he believed that learning should always precede development in the ZPD. According to Vygotsky, through the assistance of a more knowledgeable other, a child is able to learn skills or aspects of a skill that go beyond the child's actual developmental or maturational level. The lower limit of ZPD is the level of skill reached by the child working independently (also referred to as the child's developmental level). The upper limit is the level of potential skill that the child is able to reach with the assistance of a more capable instructor. In this sense, the ZPD provides a prospective view of cognitive development, as opposed to a retrospective view that characterizes development in terms of a child's independent capabilities. The advancement through and attainment of the upper limit of the ZPD is limited by the instructional and scaffolding-related capabilities of the more knowledgeable other (MKO).  The MKO is typically assumed to be an older, more experienced teacher or parent, but often can be a learner's peer or someone their junior. The MKO need not even be a person, it can be a machine or book, or other source of visual and/or audio input."

This problem was explored in Vygotsky's book, Thinking and speech, entitled in Russian, Myshlenie i rech, that was published in 1934. In fact, this book was a mere collection of essays and scholarly papers that Vygotsky wrote during different periods of his thought development and included writings of his \"instrumental\" and \"holistic\" periods. Vygotsky never saw the book published: it was published posthumously, edited by his closest associates (Kolbanovskii, Zankov, and Shif) not sooner than December, 1934, i.e., half a year after his death. The first English translation was published in 1962 (with several later revised editions) heavily abbreviated and under an alternative and incorrect translation of the title Thought and Language for the Russian title Mysl' i iazyk. The book establishes the explicit and profound connection between speech (both silent inner speech and oral language), and the development of mental concepts and cognitive awareness. Vygotsky described inner speech as being qualitatively different from verbal external speech. Although Vygotsky believed inner speech developed from external speech via a gradual process of \"internalization\" (i.e., transition from the external to the internal), with younger children only really able to \"think out loud\", he claimed that in its mature form, inner speech would not resemble spoken language as we know it (in particular, being greatly compressed). Hence, thought itself developing socially."

        "content": "Vygotsky died of tuberculosis on June 11, 1934, at the age of 37, in Moscow, Soviet Union. One of Vygotsky's last private notebook entries gives a proverbial, yet very pessimistic self-assessment of his contribution to psychological theory: This is the final thing I have done in psychology \u2013 and I will like Moses die at the summit, having glimpsed the promised land but without setting foot on it. Farewell, dear creations. The rest is silence. Immediately after his death, Vygotsky was proclaimed one of the leading psychologists in the Soviet Union, although his stellar reputation was somewhat undermined by the decree of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 1936 that denounced the mass movement, discipline, and related social practice of the so-called pedology. Yet, even despite some criticisms and censorship of his works\u2014most notably, in the post-Stalin era in the Soviet Union of 1960s-1980s by his Russian alleged and self-proclaimed best students and followers\u2014Vygotsky always remained among the most quoted scholars in the field and has become a cult figure for a number of contemporary intellectuals and practitioners in Russia and the international psychological and educational community alike."

The members of the group subsequently laid a foundation for Vygotskian psychology's systematic development in such diverse fields as the psychology of memory (P. Zinchenko), perception, sensation, and movement (Zaporozhets, Asnin, A. N. Leont'ev), personality (Lidiya Bozhovich, Asnin, A. N. Leont'ev), will and volition (Zaporozhets, A. N. Leont'ev, P. Zinchenko, L. Bozhovich, Asnin), psychology of play (G. D. Lukov, Daniil El'konin) and psychology of learning (P. Zinchenko, L. Bozhovich, D. El'konin), as well as the theory of step-by-step formation of mental actions (Pyotr Gal'perin), general psychological activity theory (A. N. Leont'ev) and psychology of action (Zaporozhets). Andrey Puzyrey elaborated the ideas of Vygotsky in respect of psychotherapy and even in the broader context of deliberate psychological intervention (psychotechnique), in general. Laszlo Garai founded a Vygotskian research group."

        "content": "In North America, Vygotsky's work was known from the end of the 1920s through a series of publications in English, but it did not have a major effect on research in general. In 1962 a translation of his posthumous 1934 book, Thinking and Speech, published with the title,Thought and Language, did not seem to change the situation considerably. It was only after an eclectic compilation of partly rephrased and partly translated works of Vygotsky and his collaborators, published in 1978 under Vygotsky's name as Mind in Society, that the Vygotsky boom started in the West: originally, in North America, and later, following the North American example, spread to other regions of the world. This version of Vygotskian science is typically associated with the names of its chief proponents Michael Cole, James Wertsch, their associates and followers, and is relatively well known under the names of \"cultural-historical activity theory\" (aka CHAT) or \"activity theory\". Scaffolding, a concept introduced by Wood, Bruner, and Ross in 1976, is somewhat related to the idea of ZPD, although Vygotsky never used the term."

        "content": "A critique of the North American interpretation of Vygotsky's ideas and, somewhat later, its global spread and dissemination appeared in the 1980s. The early 1980s criticism of Russian and Western \"Vygotskian\" scholars  continued throughout the 1990s. Van der Veer & Valsiner (1991) called these strands of Vygotskian thought \"neo-Vygotskian fashions in contemporary psychology\" and Cazden (1996) called them \"selective traditions\" in Vygotskian scholarship. Palincsar (1998) said that the zone of proximal development was \"one of the most used and least understood constructs to appear in contemporary educational literature\", and Fischer & Mercer (1992) said that the construct was \"used as little more than a fashionable alternative to Piagetian terminology or the concept of IQ for describing individual differences in attainment or potential\". Van der Veer and Valsiner also suggest clearly distinguishing between Vygotsky's original notion of \"zona blizhaishego razvitiia\" (ZBR) and what they think of as its \"superficial interpretations\" collectively known as \"zone of proximal development\" (ZPD). Valsiner and Van der Veer also identify certain statements in Vygotskian literature as mere \"declarations of faith\", i.e. hollow statements often repeated. Whereas Gillen (2000) talks of different \"versions of Vygotsky\" and Van der Veer (2008) speaks of \"multiple readings of Vygotsky\", Gradler (2007) simply speaks of \"concepts and inferences curiously attributed to Lev Vygotsky\". Toomela (2000) calls the strand known as \"activity theory\" a \"dead end\u201d for cultural-historical psychology  and, moreover, for methodological thinking in cultural psychology. Gredler & Schields (2004) question \"if anyone actually reads Vygotsky\u2019s words\" and Gredler (2012) asks whether it is \"too late to understand Vygotsky for the classroom\", while Rowlands (2000) suggests \"turning Vygotsky on his head\". According to Miller (2011), inconsistencies, contradictions, and at times fundamental flaws in \"Vygotskian\" literature were revealed in critical publications on this subject and are typically associated with - but certainly not limited to - the North American legacy of Michael Cole and James Wertsch and their associates. Smagorinsky (2011) speaks of \"challenges of claiming a Vygotskian perspective\". Lambert (2000) claims that Vygotsky's writings on play were too brief to be called a theory and furthermore were hardly relevant anymore. According to Zhang (2013), Vygotsky's theories are fundamentally flawed from a contemporary linguistic standpoint and Newman (2018) claims that \"the support claimed from Vygotsky in accounts of second language acquisition is misplaced, first because of those difficulties and, second, because many who claim support from Vygotsky, do not need or even use his theory but instead focus their attention on his empirical observations and assume incorrectly that if their own empirical observations match Vygotsky's, then Vygotsky's theory can be accepted\"."

        "title": "Lev Vygotsky_Revisionist movement in Vygotsky Studies",
        "content": "During the early twenty-first century, several scholarly reevaluations of the popular version (sometimes disparagingly termed \"Vygotsky cult\", \"the cult of Vygotsky\", or even \"the cult of personality around Vygotsky\") of Vygotsky's legacy have been undertaken and are referred to as the \"revisionist revolution in Vygotsky Studies\". Vygotsky studies conducted within the framework of the \"revisionist turn\" during the 2010s revealed systematic and massive falsifications and distortions of Vygotsky's legacy., but also demonstrated a rapid and dramatic decrease of this author's popularity in international scholarship that began in 2017. The reasons of this crisis are not entirely clear yet and are being discussed in scholarly circles. The revisionist movement in Vygotsky Studies was termed a \"revisionist revolution\" to describe a relatively recent trend that emerged in the 1990s. This trend is typically associated with growing dissatisfaction with the quality and scholarly integrity of available texts of Vygotsky and members of Vygotsky Circle, including their English translations made from largely mistaken, distorted, and even in a few instances falsified Soviet editions, which raises serious concerns about the reliability of Vygotsky's texts available in English. However, unlike critical literature that discusses Western interpretations of Vygotsky's legacy, the target of criticism and the primary object of research in the studies of the revisionist strand are Vygotsky's texts proper: the manuscripts, original lifetime publications, and Vygotsky's posthumous Soviet editions that most often were subsequently uncritically translated into other languages. The revisionist strand is solidly grounded in a series of studies in Vygotsky's archives that uncovered previously unknown and unpublished Vygotsky materials. Thus, some studies of the revisionist strand show that certain phrases, terms, and expressions typically associated with Vygotskian legacy as its core notions and concepts\u2014such as \"cultural-historical psychology\", \"cultural-historical theory\", \"cultural-historical school\", \"higher psychical/mental functions\", \"internalization\", \"zone of proximal development\", etc. in fact, either occupy not more than just a few dozen pages within the six-volume collection of Vygotsky's works, or never even occur in Vygotsky's own writings. Another series of studies revealed the questionable quality of Vygotsky's published texts that, in fact, were never finished and intended for publication by their author, but were nevertheless posthumously published without giving proper editorial acknowledgement of their unfinished, transitory nature, and with numerous editorial interventions and distortions of Vygotsky's text. Another series of publications reveals that another well-known Vygotsky's text that is often presented as the foundational work was back-translated into Russian from an English translation of a lost original and passed for the original Vygotsky's writing. This episode was referred to as \"benign forgery\"."

Therefore, an essential part of this revisionist strand is the ongoing work on \"PsyAnima Complete Vygotsky\" project that for the first time ever exposes full collections of Vygotsky's texts, uncensored and cleared from numerous mistakes, omissions, insertions, and blatant distortions and falsifications of the author's text made in Soviet editions and uncritically transferred in virtually all foreign translated editions of Vygotsky's works. This project is carried out by an international team of volunteers\u2014researchers, archival workers, and library staff\u2014from Belarus, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, and Switzerland, who joined their efforts and put together a collection of L. S. Vygotsky's texts. This publication work is supported by a stream of critical scholarly studies and publications on textology, history, theory and methodology of Vygotskian research that cumulatively contributes to the first ever edition of The Complete Works of L.S.

        "content": "Hislop was born on 13 July 1960 in Mumbles, Swansea, to a Scottish father, David Hislop, from Ayrshire, and a Channel Islander mother born in Jersey, Helen Rosemarie Hislop (n\u00e9e Beddows), who left for Wales in her late teens. Hislop did not know his grandparents. His paternal grandfather, David Murdoch Hislop, died just before he was born. His maternal grandfather, William Beddows, was originally from Lancashire. When he was five months old, Hislop's family began to travel around the world because of his father's job as a civil engineer. During his infant years, Hislop lived in Nigeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Hong Kong. While in Saudi Arabia, Hislop has said he potentially went to school with Osama Bin Laden. When Hislop was 12 years old his father died; his mother died when he was 32. On his return to Britain he was educated at Ardingly College, an independent boarding school, where he became head boy, and began his satirical career directing and appearing in revues alongside Nick Newman. Hislop's and Newman's association continued when they attended Oxford University together; later they worked together at Private Eye and on a number of comedy scriptwriting jobs. Hislop applied to read philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, but changed to English literature before arriving at Magdalen College. His Oxford tutors included Bernard O'Donoghue, John Fuller and David Norbrook. While at university, Hislop was actively involved in student journalism; he relaunched and edited the satirical magazine Passing Wind. He graduated with a 2:1 in 1981. Hislop is married to Victoria; they have two children, Emily and Will. They live in Sissinghurst in Kent. Hislop's wife has a career as an author, and in 2010 Hislop played a small role in the Greek television series The Island, which was based on his wife's bestselling novel. The series premiered on 11 October 2010 on Greece's Mega television channel. His son, Will Hislop, is an actor, writer and stand-up comedian."

        "content": "At Oxford, Hislop revived and edited the magazine Passing Wind, for which he interviewed Richard Ingrams, who was then editor of Private Eye, and Peter Cook, then the majority shareholder. Hislop's first article appeared in 1980 before he sat his university finals. A parody of The Observer magazine's \"Room of My Own\" feature, it described an IRA prisoner on the dirty protest decorating his cell in \"fetching brown\". Hislop joined the publication immediately after leaving Oxford, and became editor in 1986 following Ingrams's departure. This met opposition from Eye journalists Peter McKay and Nigel Dempster, who attempted a revolt against Hislop with the former taking Peter Cook out for lunch in an attempt to dissuade him from appointing Hislop. Cook, reportedly drunk after the lunch, instead announced Hislop was \"welcome aboard\". The new editor, dismissive of society gossip, sacked both McKay and Dempster from the magazine without hesitation. As editor of Private Eye, Ian Hislop is reputedly the most sued man in English legal history, although he is not involved in as many libel actions as he once was. A libel case was brought against Private Eye and Hislop in 1986 by the publisher Robert Maxwell after the magazine accused him of funding Labour leader Neil Kinnock's travel expenses as a means of gaining a peerage. After the case Hislop quipped: \"I've just given a fat cheque to a fat Czech\". After his death in 1991, Maxwell was revealed to be an extensive fraudster, illegally drawing on his companies' pension funds; his last writ for libel against the Eye and Hislop was about this \"malicious\" and \"mendacious\" claim. Another libel case in May 1989 threatened the magazine's existence when it was ordered to pay \u00a3600,000 in damages following an action for libel by Sonia Sutcliffe, wife of the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe. Hislop told reporters waiting outside the High Court: \"If that's justice, then I'm a banana.\" The award was dropped to \u00a360,000 on appeal. In an interview with Third Way Magazine in 1995 he explained his intentions in his work: \"Satire is the bringing to ridicule of vice, folly and humbug. All the negatives imply a set of positives. Certainly in this country, you only go round saying, 'That's wrong, that's corrupt' if you have some feeling that it should be better than that. People say, 'You satirists attack everything.' Well, we don't, actually. That's the whole point.\" In April 2017, Hislop won the London Press Club's print journalist of the year award; in his acceptance speech he said that Private Eye obtaining its best ABC sales figures since the magazine's launch 55 years earlier proved that \"journalism is A, worth doing, and B, worth paying for both in terms of paying journalists and the public paying up for it\". In January 2022, Hislop alongside fellow Eye journalists  Richard Brooks and Solomon Hughes presented evidence on MPs' conduct to the House of Commons' Standards Committee."

        "content": "Hislop's television debut was on the short-lived Channel 4 chat show Loose Talk in 1983, an experience he disliked so much that he included it on his list of most hated items when he first appeared on the BBC show Room 101. Hislop, usually in partnership with Nick Newman, was a scriptwriter on the 1980s political satire series Spitting Image, in which puppets were used to depict well-known figures, mostly politicians. He even had a puppet of himself, which sometimes appeared as a background character in sketches. Hislop has been a team captain on Have I Got News for You since it began airing in 1990. He is the only person to have appeared in every episode of its run, even filming an episode in the seventh series in spite of suffering from appendicitis (he had discharged himself from hospital immediately before the show). With regular writing partner Nick Newman, Hislop wrote the BBC Radio 4 series Gush, a satire based on the first Gulf War, in the style of Jeffrey Archer. With Newman he also wrote the family-friendly satirical sitcom My Dad's the Prime Minister and in the early nineties for the Dawn French vehicle Murder Most Horrid. Hislop and Newman wrote the Radio 4 series The News at Bedtime, a satire on fairy tales which aired over the 2009 Christmas season. The series starred Jack Dee as 'John Tweedledum' and Peter Capaldi as 'Jim Tweedledee'; the two present the \"news of the day\" in the world of fairy tales, while arguing with each other as did their namesakes. Hislop has presented serious television programmes. These include School Rules, a three-part Channel 4 study on the history of British education; an edition of the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are?, in which he attempted to trace his ancestry, and Not Forgotten, a four-part series on Channel 4 detailing the impact on British society of the First World War. A further programme, Not Forgotten: Shot at Dawn, was broadcast in January 2007, and a sixth episode, Not Forgotten: The Men Who Wouldn't Fight, featuring the stories of conscientious objectors such as Ronald Skirth, was aired on 10 November 2008. He also presented one episode of the BBC's Great Railway Journeys, in which he travelled in India (\"India East to West\" from Calcutta to Rajasthan). In May 2007 he presented a programme on BBC Four, Ian Hislop's Scouting for Boys, celebrating Robert Baden-Powell's book which inspired the Scout movement. (He is also an Ambassador for The Scout Association.) He has also written and presented factual programmes for Radio 4 about such subjects as tax rebellions, female hymn composers, scouting and patron saints of Britain and Ireland. In 2007 he became the only person to make a second guest appearance on Room 101. He has also been a screenwriter for comedian Harry Enfield. Hislop has presented several programmes for BBC 4, dealing with topics such as the Beeching Axe and the role of the Poet Laureate. The former, Ian Hislop Goes off the Rails, about the Beeching Report and its impact on the British railway network, was first aired on 2 October 2008, and achieved the second-highest audience to date for any BBC Four programme (and the highest for a documentary) with 1.3\u00a0million viewers. The latter, Ian Hislop's Changing of the Bard, launched the May 2009 BBC 4 Poetry season, and Hislop recounted the history of the post from the first official holder, John Dryden, to the then recently announced first female, first Scot and first openly bisexual laureate, Carol Ann Duffy. His series on Victorian social reformers, Ian Hislop's Age of the Do-Gooders, aired on BBC Two beginning on 29 November 2010. His programme on the history of banks, When Bankers were Good, first aired on BBC Two in November 2011, and dealt with famous bankers from history, such as the Rothschilds, the Gurneys and the Lloyds, as well as 19th-century philanthropists and reformers such as Charles Dickens and Elizabeth Fry. He has also appeared on Question Time. In one edition he made an open attack on Jeffrey Archer, who had been imprisoned for perjury, when his wife, Mary Archer, was a fellow panellist. She was noticeably angry that the matter had been raised. In 2003 he was listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. In 2004, Question Time'''s 25th anniversary celebrations included a vote in which viewers chose the confrontation as the best moment in the programme's history; it won 51% of the votes, double the number for the second-placed entry. In another episode he criticised the premise of capital punishment, something which had been advocated by a Conservative panel member Priti Patel, and more recently has discussed Britain's vote to leave the European Union.Ian Hislop's Stiff Upper Lip - An Emotional History of Britain, about how a meme for repression of emotions spread through British culture, began on 2 October 2012 and ran for three episodes on BBC Two. Beginning on 9 April 2014, Hislop presented a three-part BBC Two series Ian Hislop's Olden Days. In 2016, he presented The Secret of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, the personal and creative story behind the symphony. Later in the same year, Hislop gave the prestigious George Orwell Lecture at London's UCL. Hislop has also curated an exhibition for the British Museum, called I Object: Ian Hislop's Search for Dissent, which was presented from 6 September 2018 to 20 January 2019. As the editor of Private Eye, Hislop has received an award for Outstanding Contribution to British Media at the Campaign British Media Awards 2019. Hislop has also been recognised for his broadcasting career, having produced TV and radio documentaries on immigration and the First World War."

Appearing on Question Time on 18 September 2008, he praised Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable for his analysis of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, and apparently expressed support for the Liberal Democrats, jocularly stating \"I'm standing for them.\" In a 2009 \"Five minutes with\" interview with Matthew Stadlen for BBC News, Hislop stated that if he were required, \"at the point of a gun\", to stand in an election for any British political party, he would stand for the fictional \"Vince Cable for Treasurer Party\". After the formation of the coalition government in 2010, Hislop remarked in an interview, \"I like the idea of this coalition neutralising the loonies on both sides\". He has also been highly critical of the leadership of the European Union, calling for a referendum on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in a 2003 recording of Have I Got News for You. However, referring to Britain's vote to leave the European Union, Hislop said on Question Time that \"after an election or a referendum, even if you lose the vote, you are entitled to go on making the argument\". A joke on the front of Private Eye titled \"BREXIT LATEST\" mocking the reaction to Brexit received \"fifty or so\" letters of complaint in the next issue. Hislop mocked this, saying that \"There was one [letter] from a vicar, too, who told me that it was time to accept the victory of the majority of the people and to stop complaining. ... I wrote back and told him that this argument was a bit much, coming from a church that had begun with a minority of 12\". He has expressed dismay over the level of public debate in the aftermath of Britain's vote to leave the EU and the election of Donald Trump, describing it as Orwellian in nature, saying that \"one is unsure whether to feel relieved at the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or worried about the possibility of history repeating itself, not as farce, but as tragedy again.\" In 2019, an outtake from Have I Got News for You went viral, featuring Hislop saying that he would like to see Boris Johnson \"have a fair trial, with a desirable result of him being in prison forever\". The comment was made in response of the High Court's ruling that Johnson would not have to face a criminal prosecution for claims he made during the EU referendum."

        "content": "Sir Matthew Hale  (1 November 1609 \u2013 25 December 1676) was an influential English barrister, judge and jurist most noted for his treatise Historia Placitorum Coron\u00e6, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown. Born to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was 5, Hale was raised by his father's relative, a strict Puritan, and inherited his faith. In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he joined Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 May 1636. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas. As a judge, Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. He sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676. Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written work, published after his death. However, more recently, his execution of at least two women for witchcraft, his defense of marital rape, and his belief that capital punishment should extend to those as young as fourteen might bring this into question. His Historia Placitorum Coron\u00e6, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \"of the highest authority\", while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \"appeal to reason\" and John Selden's \"appeal to contract\", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009."

        "content": "Hale was born on 1 November 1609 in West End House (now known as The Grange or Alderley Grange) in Alderley, Gloucestershire to Robert Hale, a barrister of Lincoln's Inn, and Joanna Poyntz. His father gave up his practice as a barrister several years before Hale's birth \"because he could not understand the reason of giving colour in pleadings\". This refers to a process through which the defendant would refer a case over the validity of his title to land to a judge instead of a jury, through claiming a (false) allegation about this right. Such an allegation would be a question of law rather than a question of fact, and as such decided by the judge with no reference to the jurors. Although in common use, Robert Hale apparently saw this as deceptive and \"contrary to the exactness of truth and justice which became a Christian; so that he withdrew himself from the inns of court to live on his estate in the country\". John Hostettler, in his biography of Matthew Hale, points out that his father's concerns about giving colour in pleadings could not have been very strong \"since he not only retired to his estate at Alderley where he managed to live on his wife's inherited income, but also directed in his will that Matthew should make a career in the law\". Both of Hale's parents died before he was five; Joanna in 1612, and Robert in 1614. It was then revealed that Robert had been so generous in giving money to the poor that at his death his estate provided only \u00a3100 of income a year, of which \u00a320 was to be paid to the local poor. Hale thus passed into the care of Anthony Kingscot, one of his father's relatives. A strong Puritan, Kingscot had Hale taught by a Mr. Stanton, the vicar of Wotton known as the \"scandalous vicar\" due to his extremist puritan views. On 20 October 1626, at the age of 16, Hale matriculated at the University of Oxford as a member of Magdalen Hall, with the goal of becoming a priest.  Both Kingscot and Stanton had intended this to be his career, and his education had been conducted with that in mind. He was taught by Obadiah Sedgwick, another Puritan, and excelled in both his studies and fencing. Hale also regularly attended church, private prayer-meetings, and was described as \"simple in his attire, and rather aesthetic\". After a company of actors came to Oxford, Hale attended so many plays and other social activities that his studies began to suffer, and he began to turn away from Puritanism. In light of this, he abandoned his desire to become a priest and instead decided to become a soldier. His relatives were unable to persuade him to become a priest, or even a lawyer, with Hale describing lawyers as \"a barbarous set of people unfit for anything but their own trade\". His plans to become a soldier died after a legal battle concerning his estate, in which he consulted John Glanville. Glanville successfully persuaded Hale to become a lawyer, and, after leaving Oxford at the age of 20 before obtaining a degree, he joined Lincoln's Inn on 8 November 1628. Fearing that the theatre might dissuade him from his legal studies as it had at Oxford, he swore  \"never to see a stage-play again\". At around this time he was drinking with a group of friends when one of them became so drunk he fainted; Hale prayed to God to forgive and save his friend, and forgive him for his previous excesses. His friend recovered, and Hale was restored to his Puritan faith, never drinking to someone's health again (not even drinking to the King) and going to church every Sunday for 36 years. He instead settled into his studies, working for up to 16 hours a day during his first two years at Lincoln's Inn before reducing it to eight hours due to health concerns. As well as reading the law reports and statutes, Hale also studied the Roman civil law and jurisprudence. Outside of the law, Hale studied anatomy, history, philosophy and mathematics. He refused to read the news or attend social events, and occupied himself entirely with his studies and visits to church."

        "content": "On 17 May 1636, Hale was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn, and immediately became the pupil of William Noy. Hale and Noy became close friends, to the point where he was referred to as \"the young Noy\", and more crucially he also met and befriended John Selden, a \"man of almost universal learning, whose theories were to dominate much of [Hale's] later thought\". Selden persuaded him to continue with his studies outside the law, and much of Hale's written work is concerned with theology and science as well as legal theory. Hale gained a good legal practice, although he allowed his Christian faith to govern his work. He sought to help the court reach a just verdict, whatever his client's concerns, and normally returned half his fee or charged a standard fee of 10 shillings rather than allow costs to inflate. He refused to accept unjust cases, and always tried to be on the \"right\" side of any case; John Campbell wrote that \"If he saw that a cause was unjust, he for a great while would not meddle further in it but to give his advice that it was so; if the parties after that would go on, they were to seek another counsellor, for he would assist none in acts of injustice\". Despite this, he was wealthy enough to purchase land worth \u00a34,200 in 1648. He was in great demand; law reporters began recording his cases and in 1641 he advised Thomas Wentworth, the first Earl of Strafford, over his attainder for high treason. Although unsuccessful, Hale was then called to represent William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, during his impeachment by the House of Lords in October 1644. Hale, along with John Herne, argued that none of Laud's alleged offences constituted treason, and that the Treason Act 1351 had abolished all common law treasons. John Wilde, arguing for the prosecution, admitted that none of Laud's actions amounted to treason, but argued that all of them together did. Herne, in his arguments written by Hale, retorted that \"I crave your mercy, [Wilde]. I never understood before this time that two hundred couple of black rabbits would make a black horse!\" The case against Laud began to fail, but Parliament issued an Act of Attainder which declared him guilty, and sentenced him to death. After the capture of Charles I, Hale was expected to defend him, and indeed offered to do so; the King refused to submit to the court, claiming he did not recognise its jurisdiction. Edward Foss writes, based on the statement of Charles Runnington, that it was Hale who actually provided the King with this defence, and that it was only because the defence prevented any counsel being called for the King that Hale did not appear in court. When it became clear that the King was losing the Civil War, and only Oxford held out, Hale decided to act as a commissioner to negotiate its surrender, fearing that the city might otherwise be destroyed. Thanks to his intercession, honourable terms were reached, and the libraries preserved. Despite practising in the politically charged environment of the English Civil War and primarily defending opponents of the resulting Commonwealth of England, Hale's reputation did not suffer. First, he largely kept out of the war, even ignoring news of its progress, and instead translating The Life and Death of Pomponious Atticus into English. Second, he was acknowledged as universally able and of high integrity during his cases, retorting to those who complained of his defence of the Royalists that he was \"pleading in defence of the laws which they professed they would maintain and preserve; and that he was doing his duty to his client and was not to be daunted by such threatenings\"."

        "title": "Matthew Hale (jurist)_Hale Commission",
        "content": "During the rule of both the Commonwealth and the Protectorate, there was considerable desire for law reform. Many judges and lawyers were corrupt, and the criminal law followed no real reason or philosophy. Any felony was punishable by death, proceedings were in a form of Norman French, and judges regularly imprisoned juries for reaching a verdict they disagreed with. Oliver Cromwell and the Rump Parliament aimed to establish a \"new society\", which included reforming the law.  To that end, on 30 January 1652 Hale was appointed chairman of a commission to investigate law reform, which soon became known as the Hale Commission. The Commission's official remit was defined by the Commons; \"taking into consideration what inconveniences there are in the law; and how the mischiefs which grow from delays, the chargeableness and irregularities in the proceedings in the law may be prevented, and the speediest way to reform the same, and to present their opinions to such committee as the Parliament shall appoint\". The Commission consisted of eight lawyers and 13 laymen, which sat from 23 January approximately three times a week. The Commission recommended various changes, such as reducing the use of the death penalty, allowing defendants access to legal counsel, legal aid and the abolition of peine forte et dure as a torture mechanism. Dissolved on 23 July 1652 after producing 16 bills, none of the Commission's recommendations immediately made it into law, although two (to abolish fines for original writs and to develop procedures for civil marriages) were brought into force through statutes by the Barebone's Parliament. Almost all of the recommendations eventually became part of English law, with John Hostettler, in his biography of Hale, writing that if the measures had been put into law immediately, \"we would have been honouring such pioneers for their farsightedness in enhancing our legal system and the concept of justice\"."

        "content": "Oliver Cromwell, noting Hale's abilities, asked him to become a Justice of the Common Pleas. Although Hale considered that taking this commission would make others think he supported the Commonwealth, he was persuaded to do so, replacing John Puleston. Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges, and as such Hale was made a Serjeant on 25 January 1653. He was formally appointed a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, one of the three principal Westminster courts, on 31 January 1653, on the condition that he \"would not be required to acknowledge the usurper's authority\". He also refused to put people to death for offences against the government; he believed that because the government authorising him to do so was an illegal one, \"putting men to death on that account was murder\". William Blackstone later wrote that \"if judgment of death be given by a judge not authorized by lawful commission, and execution is done accordingly, the judge is guilty of murder; and upon this argument Sir Matthew Hale himself, though he accepted the place of a judge of the Common Pleas under Cromwell's government, yet declined to sit on the crown side at the assizes, and try prisoners, having very strong objections to the legality of the usurper's commission\". Hale also made decisions which negatively impacted on the Commonwealth, executing a soldier for murdering a civilian in 1655, and actively refusing to attend a court hearing outside term time. On another occasion, Cromwell personally selected a jury in a trial he was concerned with, something contrary to law; as a result, Hale dismissed the jury and refused to hear the case. On 15 May 1659, Hale chose to retire, and was replaced by John Archer."

        "content": "On 3 September 1654, the First Protectorate Parliament was called; of the 400 English members, only two were lawyers \u2013 Hooke, a Baron of the Exchequer, and Hale, who was elected Member of Parliament for his home county of Gloucestershire. Hale was an active MP, persuading the Commons to reject a motion to destroy the Tower of London's archives, and introducing several motions to preserve the authority of Parliament. The first was that the government should be \"in a Parliament and a single person limited and restrained as the Parliament should think fit\", and he later proposed that the English Council of State be subject to re-election every three years by the House of Commons, that the militia should be controlled by Parliament, and that supplies should only be granted to the army for limited periods. While these proposals got support, Cromwell refused to allow any MPs into the Commons until they signed an oath recognising his authority, which Hale refused to do. As such, none of them were passed. Dissatisfied with the First Protectorate Parliament, Cromwell dissolved it on 22 January 1655. A Second Protectorate Parliament was called on 17 September 1656, which wrote a constitution titled Humble Petition and Advice that called for the creation of an Upper House to perform the job of the former House of Lords. Cromwell accepted this constitution, and in December 1657 nominated the Upper House's members. Hale, as a judge, was called to it. This new House's extensive jurisdiction and authority was immediately questioned by the Commons, and Cromwell responded by dissolving the Parliament on 4 February 1658. On 3 September 1658, Oliver Cromwell died and was replaced by his son, Richard Cromwell. Richard Cromwell summoned a new Parliament on 27 January 1659, and Hale was returned as MP for Oxford University.  Richard Cromwell was a weak leader, however, and ruled for only 8 months before resigning. On 16 March 1660 General Monck forced the Parliament to vote for its own dissolution and call new elections. At the same time, Charles II made the Declaration of Breda, and when the Convention Parliament met on 25 April 1660 (with Hale a member from Gloucestershire again) it immediately began negotiations with the King. Hale moved in the Commons that \"a committee might be appointed to look into the overtures that had been made, and the concessions that had been offered, by [Charles I]\" and \"from thence to digest such propositions, as they should think fit to be sent over to [Charles II]\" who was still in Breda. On 1 May Parliament restored the King, and Charles II landed in Dover three weeks later, prompting the English Restoration."

        "title": "Matthew Hale (jurist)_Chief Baron and Chief Justice",
        "content": "Hale's first task in the new regime was as part of the Special Commission of 37 judges who tried the 29 regicides not included in the Declaration of Breda, between 9 and 19 October 1660. All were found guilty of treason, and 10 of them were hanged, drawn and quartered. Sitting as a judge in this trial led to some viewing Hale as hypocritical, with F.A. Inderwick later writing \"I confess to a feeling of pain at finding [Hale] in October 1660, sitting as a judge at the Old Bailey, trying and condemning to death batches of the regicides, men under whose orders he had himself acted, who had been his colleagues in Parliament, with whom he had sat on committees to alter the law\". Perhaps as reward for this, he became Chief Baron of the Exchequer on 7 November 1660, replacing Sir Orlando Bridgeman. Hale had no wish to receive the knighthood that accompanied this appointment and so tried to avoid being near the King; in response, the Lord Chancellor Lord Clarendon invited him to his house, where the King was present. Hale was knighted on the spot. There were many instances of parties to a case attempting to bribe Hale. When a Duke approached him before a case \"to help the judge understand a case that was to come before him\", Hale said that he would only hear about cases in court. In another case, he was sent venison by a party. After noticing the man's name and verifying that he had indeed sent Hale some venison, Hale refused to let the case proceed until he had paid the man for the food. When Sir John Croke, suspected in engaging in a conspiracy, sent him some sugar loaves to excuse his absence from a case, Hale remarked that \"I cannot think that Sir John believes that the King's Justices come into the country to take bribes. Some other person, having a design to put a trick upon him, sent them in his name\". Hale returned the loaves, and refused to continue until Croke appeared before him. Hale was noted during this period for giving latitude to those accused of religious impropriety, and through doing so \"secured the confidence and affection of all classes of his countrymen\". His knowledge of equity was considered as great as his knowledge of the law, and Lord Nottingham, considered the \"father of equity\", \"worshipped Hale as a great master\". On 2 September 1666, the Great Fire of London broke out. Over 100,000 people were made homeless, and by the time the fire ended over 13,000 houses and 400 streets had been destroyed. An Act of Parliament enacted on 8 February 1667 constituted a Court of Fire, tasked with dealing with property disputes over ownership, liability and the rebuilding of the city. Hale was tasked with sitting in this court, which met in Clifford's Inn, and heard 140 of the 374 cases the court dealt with during its first year in operation. On 18 May 1671, Hale was made Chief Justice of the King's Bench after the death of John Kelynge. Edward Turnour replaced him as Chief Baron of the Exchequer. Hale was not noted as a particularly innovative judge, but took pains to ensure that his decisions were easy to understand and informative. Roger North wrote that \"I have known the Court of King's Bench sitting every day from eight to 12, and the Lord Chief Justice Hale's managing matters of law to all imaginable advantage to the students, and in that he took a pleasure or rather pride; he encouraged arguing when it was to the purpose, and used to debate with counsel, so that the court might have been taken for an academy of sciences as well as the seat of justice\". He was noted for allowing counsel to fix any problems with pleadings, and for letting them correct him if he made an error in his summing up. He disliked eloquence, writing that \"If the judge or jury has a right understanding it signifies nothing but a waste of time and loss of words, and if they are weak, and easily wrought upon, it is a more decent way of corrupting them by bribing their fancies and biassing their affections.\" As a judge, however, he was noted by Lord Nottingham as the greatest orator on the bench."

His initial attempts to resign as Chief Justice were declined by the King, but when Hale applied for a writ of ease the King reluctantly allowed him to retire on 20 February 1676, granting him a pension of \u00a31,000 a year. He was replaced as Chief Justice by Richard Raynsford. After suffering for ten more months, Hale died on 25 December 1676 at his country home, The Lower House (now the site of the present day Alderley House). He was buried next to his first wife's tomb in the churchyard of St Kenelm's, the church which adjoined his home at Alderley, with a monument erected that reads: His estate was largely left for his widow, with his legal texts given to his grandson Gabriel if Gabriel chose to study the law, and his more valuable manuscripts and books given to Lincoln's Inn.

Moore and Hale had 10 children, but she was evidently a highly extravagant woman, with Hale warning his children that \"an idle or expensive wife is most times an ill bargain, though she bring a great portion\". Moore died in 1658, and in 1667 Hale married Anne Bishop, his housekeeper. Descriptions of Bishop differ; Roger North wrote that \"[Hale] was unfortunate in his family; for he married his own servant made, and then, for an excuse, said there was no wisdom below the girdle\". Richard Baxter, on the other hand, described Anne as \"one of [Hale's] own judgment and temper, prudent and loving, and fit to please him; and that would not draw on him the trouble of much acquaintance and relations\". Hale himself described her as a \"most dutiful, faithful, and loving wife\" who was appointed an executrix on his death."

        "content": "Hale is universally considered an excellent judge and jurist, particularly due to his writings. Edward Foss wrote that he was an \"eminent judge, whom all look up to as one of the brightest luminaries of the law, as well for the soundness of his learning as for the excellence of his life\". Similarly, John Campbell in his Lives of the Chief Justices of England, wrote that Hale was \"one of the most pure, the most pious, the most independent, and the most learned\" of judges. Henry Flanders, writing in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, describes Hale during his lifetime as \"the most learned, the most able, the most honorable man to be found in the profession of the law\". Hale's writings have been cited as recently as 1993, in the case of R v Kingston, where the Court of Appeal relied on his statement that \"drunkenness is not a defence\" to uphold a conviction. William Holdsworth argues that it was his learning in Roman law and jurisprudence which allowed him to work so effectively; because he had seen other legal systems at work, he \"could both criticise the defects of English law and state its rules in a more orderly form than they had ever been stated before\". Hale's political neutrality and personal integrity has been attributed to his Puritanism, and his support of the common law; \"Regimes come and go, the common law abides...For Hale...legal continuity was vital for civic identity\". Much comparison has been made of Hale with Edward Coke. Campbell considered Hale to be the superior lawyer, because while he failed to engage in public life he treated law as a science, and maintained judicial independence and neutrality. Hostettler, while considering Hale a better lawyer than Coke and more influential, says that Coke was better overall. While Hale was in possession of judicial impartiality, and his written works are considered highly important, his lack of venture into public affairs limited his progressive influence. Coke's active intervention allowed him to \"breath new life into medieval law and use it to oppose conciliar justice\", encouraging judges to be more independent and \"unfettered except by the common law whose supremacy it was their duty to uphold\". J.H. Corbett, writing in the Alberta Law Quarterly, notes that with Hale's popularity at the time (Parliamentary constituencies \"fought over the privilege of returning him\") he could have been just as successful as Coke if he had chosen to take an active role in public affairs."

        "title": "Matthew Hale (jurist)_Writings",
        "content": "Hale's posthumous legacy is his written work. He wrote a variety of texts, treatises and manuscripts, the most major of which are The History and Analysis of the Common Law of England, published in 1713, and the Historia Placitorum Coron\u00e6, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown, published in 1736. The Analysis was based on lectures he gave to students, and was most likely not intended to be published; it is considered the first history of English law ever written. Divided into 13 chapters, the book dealt with the history of English law and some suggestions for reform. William Blackstone, when writing his Commentaries on the Laws of England, noted in his preface that \"of all the earlier schemes for digesting the Laws of England the most natural and scientific, as well as the most comprehensive, appeared to be that of Sir Matthew Hale in his posthumous Analysis of the Law\". Hale proposed the creation of county courts, and also drew a strong distinction between written laws, such as statutes, and customary, unwritten laws. He also argued that the common law was subject to Parliament, far before the confirmation of Parliamentary supremacy, and that the law should protect the rights and civil liberties of the King's subjects. He also argued for the confirmation of trial by jury, which he described as \"the best mode of trial in the world\", while the 13th chapter divided the law into the laws of persons and of property, and dealt with the rights, wrongs and remedies recognised by the law at the time. William Holdsworth, himself considered one of the greatest common law historians, described it as \"the ablest introductory sketch of a history of English law that appeared till the publication of Pollock and Maitland's volumes in 1895\". The Historia is perhaps Hale's most famous work. Pleas of the Crown were capital offences committed \"against the peace of our Lord the King, his Crown and dignity\"; as such, the book dealt with capital crimes and the associated procedure. The 710-page work followed the pattern of Coke's Institutes of the Lawes of England, but was far more methodical; James Fitzjames Stephen said that Hale's work \"was not only of the highest authority but shows a depth of thought which puts it in quite a different category from Coke's Institute... [it] is far more of a treatise and far less of an index or mere work of practice\". The book dealt with the criminal capacity of infants, insanity and idiocy, the defence of drunkenness, capital offences, treason, homicide and theft. In the 19th century, Andrew Amos wrote a critique of the Historia titled Ruins of Time exemplified in Sir Matthew Hale's History of the Pleas of the Crown, which both criticised and praised Hale's work while directing the main criticism at the judges and lawyers who cited the Historia without considering that it was dated. Hale also reorganised the first of Coke's Institutes, which dealt with Thomas de Littleton's Treatise on Tenures; Hale's edition was the most commonly used, and the first to extract Coke's broader philosophical points. His written works, however, were fragmentary, and did not individually lay out his jurisprudence. Harold J. Berman, writing in the Yale Law Journal, notes that it is only \"possible by a study of the entire corpus of Hale's writings to reconstruct the coherent legal philosophy that underlies them\". Hale's writings on witchcraft and marital rape were extremely influential. In 1662, he was involved in \"one of the most notorious of the seventeenth century English witchcraft trials\", where he sentenced two women (Amy Duny and Rose Callender) to death for witchcraft. The judgment of Hale in this case was extremely influential in future cases, and was used in the Salem witch trials to justify the forfeiture of the accused's lands. G. Geis, writing in the British Journal of Law and Society, ties Hale's opinions on witchcraft in with his writings on marital rape, which are found in the Historia. Hale believed that a marriage was a contract, which merged the legal entities of husband and wife into one body. As such, \"The husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract\". This exception to the law of rape existed in England and Wales until 1991, primarily due to his influence, until it was repealed by the House of Lords in R v R. Although Hale wrote voluminously, he published little in his lifetime: his writings were discovered and published by others after his death. There are still dozens of volumes of his manuscripts that remain unpublished, including numerous theological treatises. The majority of these manuscripts are found in the Fairhurst Papers at Lambeth Palace Library. His largest work in manuscript, \"De Deo\" (ca. 1662\u20131667), consists of ten books filling five volumes and is estimated to contain nearly a million words. There are also three copies of a treatise on natural law at the British Library. A critical edition of this treatise on natural law has been published as Of the Law of Nature (2015), which contains chapters on law in general and the law of nature. In the same work, Hale criticizes the reduction of natural law to self-preservation as \"the only Cardinall Law\" (the view normally associated with Thomas Hobbes), cites John Selden's De jure naturali et gentium juxta disciplinam Ebraeorum repeatedly, and appears to share conceptual continuities with both Hugo Grotius's De jure belli ac pacis and Francisco Su\u00e1rez's Tractatus de legibus ac deo legislatore."

        "content": "During Hale's period as a barrister and judge, the general conclusion in England was that the repository of the law and conventional wisdom was not politics, as in Renaissance Europe, but the common law. This had been brought about thanks to Sir Edward Coke, who in his Institutes and practice as a judge advocated judge-made law. Coke asserted that judge-made law had the answer to any question asked of it, and as a result, \"a learned judge... was the natural arbiter of politics\". This principle was known as the \"appeal to reason\", with \"reason\" referring not to rationality but the method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws. Coke's theory meant that certainty of the law and \"intellectual beauty\" was the way to see if a law was just and correct, and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable. John Selden held similar beliefs, in that he thought that the common law was the proper law of England. However, he argued that this did not necessarily create judicial discretion to play with it, and that proper did not necessarily equal perfect. The law was nothing more than a contract made by the English people; this is known as the \"appeal to contract\". Thomas Hobbes argued against Coke's theory. Along with Francis Bacon, he argued for natural law, created by the King's authority, not by any individual judge. Hobbes felt that there was no skill unique to lawyers, and that the law could be understood not through Coke's \"reason\" (the method used by lawyers) but through understanding the King's instructions. While the judges did make law, this was only valid because it was \"tacitly confirmed (because not disapproved) by the [King]\". Hale's legal theory was highly influenced by both Coke and Selden. He argued that the making of the law was a contract, but that it was subject to a test of \"reasonable\" character, something that only the judges could rule on. In this way, he sat in a middle ground between Selden and Coke. This was in conflict with the argument of Hobbes. In 1835, Hale's \"Reflections on Hobbes' Dialogue\" was discovered; Frederick Pollock posits that since Hobbes' Dialogue was first published in 1681, six years after Hale's death, Hale must have seen an early copy or draft. D.E.C. Yale, writing in the Cambridge Law Journal, suggests that Chief Justice Vaughan had access to the Dialogue, and may have passed a copy on to Hale before his death. In his Reflections, Hale agreed with Coke that the judge's task was to bring the reason of the common law (the coherence of the legal system) in line with the reason of the law in question (to justify that law). He disagreed with Hobbes that a layman could understand the law, saying that \"he that hath been educated in the study of the law hath a great advantage over those that have been otherwise exercised\". The distinction between Coke and Hale is that Hale agreed with Selden that law was created through agreement, and disagreed that reason had an inherent binding power. Hale agreed with Hobbes that the interpretation of the law could not be left to individual reason, and that the law is not an exact science; the best that can be produced is a set of laws which give a reasonable outcome in the majority of cases."

        "content": "Arthur James Balfour, 1st Earl of Balfour,  (,  ; 25 July 184819 March 1930), also known as Lord Balfour, was a British Conservative statesman who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1902 to 1905. As foreign secretary in the Lloyd George ministry, he issued the Balfour Declaration in 1917 on behalf of the cabinet. Entering Parliament in 1874, Balfour achieved prominence as Chief Secretary for Ireland, in which position he suppressed agrarian unrest whilst taking measures against absentee landlords. He opposed Irish Home Rule, saying there could be no half-way house between Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom or becoming independent. From 1891 he led the Conservative Party in the House of Commons, serving under his uncle, Lord Salisbury, whose government won large majorities in 1895 and 1900. An esteemed debater, he was bored by the mundane tasks of party management. In July 1902, he succeeded his uncle as prime minister. In domestic policy he passed the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903, which bought out most of the Anglo-Irish land owners. The Education Act 1902 had a major long-term impact in modernising the school system in England and Wales and provided financial support for schools operated by the Church of England and by the Catholic Church. Nonconformists were outraged and mobilised their voters, but were unable to reverse it. In foreign and defence policy, he oversaw reform of British defence policy and supported Jackie Fisher's naval innovations. He secured the Entente Cordiale with France, an alliance that isolated Germany. He cautiously embraced imperial preference as championed by Joseph Chamberlain, but resignations from the Cabinet over the abandonment of free trade left his party divided. He also suffered from public anger at the later stages of the Boer war (counter-insurgency warfare characterised as \"methods of barbarism\") and the importation of Chinese labour to South Africa (\"Chinese slavery\"). He resigned as prime minister in December 1905 and the following month the Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat at the 1906 election, in which he lost his own seat. He soon re-entered Parliament and continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition throughout the crisis over Lloyd George's 1909 budget, the narrow loss of two further General Elections in 1910, and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911. He resigned as party leader in 1911. Balfour returned as First Lord of the Admiralty in Asquith's Coalition Government (1915\u201316). In December 1916, he became foreign secretary in David Lloyd George's coalition. He was frequently left out of the inner workings of foreign policy, although the Balfour Declaration on a Jewish homeland bore his name. He continued to serve in senior positions throughout the 1920s, and died on 19 March 1930 aged 81, having spent a vast inherited fortune. He never married. Balfour trained as a philosopherhe originated an argument against believing that human reason could determine truthand was seen as having a detached attitude to life, epitomised by a remark attributed to him: \"Nothing matters very much and few things matter at all\"."

His father was a Scottish MP, as was his grandfather James; his mother, a member of the Cecil family descended from Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, was the daughter of the 2nd Marquess of Salisbury and a sister of the 3rd Marquess, the future prime minister. His godfather was the Duke of Wellington, after whom he was named. He was the eldest son, third of eight children, and had four brothers and three sisters. Arthur Balfour was educated at Grange Preparatory School at Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire (1859\u20131861), and Eton College (1861\u20131866), where he studied with the influential master, William Johnson Cory. He then went up to the University of Cambridge, where he read moral sciences at Trinity College (1866\u20131869), graduating with a second-class honours degree. His younger brother was the Cambridge embryologist Francis Maitland Balfour (1851\u20131882)."

        "content": "Balfour met his cousin May Lyttelton in 1870 when she was 19. After her two previous serious suitors had died, Balfour is said to have declared his love for her in December 1874. She died of typhus on Palm Sunday, 21 March 1875; Balfour arranged for an emerald ring to be buried in her coffin. Lavinia Talbot, May's older sister, believed that an engagement had been imminent, but her recollections of Balfour's distress (he was \"staggered\") were not written down until thirty years later. The historian R. J. Q. Adams points out that May's letters discuss her love life in detail, but contain no evidence that she was in love with Balfour, nor that he had spoken to her of marriage. He visited her only once during her serious three-month illness, and was soon accepting social invitations again within a month of her death. Adams suggests that, although he may simply have been too shy to express his feelings fully, Balfour may also have encouraged tales of his youthful tragedy as a convenient cover for his disinclination to marry; the matter cannot be conclusively proven. In later years mediums claimed to pass on messages from hersee the \"Cross-Correspondences\". Balfour remained a lifelong bachelor. Margot Tennant (later Margot Asquith) wished to marry him, but Balfour said: \"No, that is not so. I rather think of having a career of my own.\" His household was maintained by his unmarried sister, Alice. In middle age, Balfour had a 40-year friendship with Mary Charteris (n\u00e9e Wyndham), Lady Elcho, later Countess of Wemyss and March. Although one biographer writes that \"it is difficult to say how far the relationship went\", her letters suggest they may have become lovers in 1887 and may have engaged in sado-masochism, a claim echoed by A. N. Wilson. Another biographer believes they had \"no direct physical relationship\", although he dismisses as unlikely suggestions that Balfour was homosexual, or, in view of a time during the Boer War when he was seen as he replied to a message while drying himself after his bath, Lord Beaverbrook's claim that he was \"a hermaphrodite\" whom no-one saw naked. Balfour was a leading member of the social and intellectual group The Souls."

In spring 1878, he became private secretary to his uncle Lord Salisbury. He accompanied Salisbury (then foreign secretary) to the Congress of Berlin and gained his first experience in international politics in connection with the settlement of the Russo-Turkish conflict. At the same time he became known in the world of letters; the academic subtlety and literary achievement of his Defence of Philosophic Doubt (1879) suggested he might make a reputation as a philosopher. Balfour divided his time between politics and academic pursuits. Biographer Sydney Zebel suggested that Belfour continued to appear an amateur or dabbler in public affairs, devoid of ambition and indifferent to policy issues. However, in fact he actually made a dramatic transition to a deeply involved politician. His assets, according to Zebel, included a strong ambition that he kept hidden, shrewd political judgment, a knack for negotiation, a taste for intrigue, and care to avoid factionalism. Most importantly, he deepened his close ties with his uncle Lord Salisbury. He also maintained cordial relationships with Disraeli, Gladstone and other national leaders. Released from his duties as private secretary by the 1880 general election, he began to take more part in parliamentary affairs. He was for a time politically associated with Lord Randolph Churchill, Sir Henry Drummond Wolff and John Gorst. This quartet became known as the \"Fourth Party\" and gained notoriety for leader Lord Randolph Churchill's free criticism of Sir Stafford Northcote, Lord Cross and other prominent members of the Conservative \"old gang\"."

        "content": "In 1885, Lord Salisbury appointed Balfour President of the Local Government Board; the following year he became Secretary for Scotland with a seat in the cabinet. These offices, while offering few opportunities for distinction, were an apprenticeship. In early 1887, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, resigned because of illness and Salisbury appointed his nephew in his place. The selection was much criticized. It was received with contemptuous ridicule by the Irish Nationalists, for none suspected Balfour's immense strength of will, his debating power, his ability in attack and his still greater capacity to disregard criticism.  Balfour surprised critics by ruthless enforcement of the Crimes Act. The Mitchelstown Massacre occurred on 9 September 1887, when Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) members fired at a crowd protesting against the conviction under the Act of MP William O'Brien and another man. Three were killed by the RIC's gunfire. When Balfour defended the RIC in the Commons, O'Brien dubbed him \"Bloody Balfour\". His steady administration did much to dispel his reputation as a political lightweight. In Parliament he resisted overtures to the Irish Parliamentary Party on Home Rule, which he saw as an expression of superficial or false Irish nationalism. Allied with Joseph Chamberlain's Liberal Unionists, he encouraged Unionist activism in Ireland. Balfour also helped the poor by creating the Congested Districts Board for Ireland in 1890. Balfour downplayed the factor of Irish nationalism, arguing that the real issues were economic. Regarding ownership and control of the land, he believed that once violence was suppressed and land was sold to the tenants, Irish nationalism would no longer threaten the unity of the United Kingdom. The slogan \"to kill home rule with kindness\" characterized Balfour's new policy toward Ireland. The Liberals had begun land sales to Irish tenants with the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881 and this was expanded by the Conservatives in the land purchase scheme of 1885.  However the depression in agriculture kept prices low. Balfour's solution was to keep selling land and in 1887 lowering rents to match the lower prices, and protected more tenants against eviction by their landlords. Balfour greatly expanded the land sales. They culminated in the final Unionist land purchase programme of 1903,  when Balfour was prime minister and George Wyndham was the Irish secretary.  It encouraged landlords the sell by means of a 12% cash bonus. Tenants were encouraged to buy with a low interest rate, and payments drawn out over 68 years. In 1909, Liberal legislation required compulsory sales in certain cases. As the landlords sold out, they relocated to Britain, giving up their political power in Ireland. Tensions in the countryside dramatically declined as some 200,000 peasant proprietors owned about half the land in Ireland. After 1890 violence declined sharply, and as Balfour had hoped, Irish nationalism was a relatively minor factor. The situation suddenly was transformed when the Easter rebellion of 1916 radicalised Ireland."

Smith in 1891, Balfour became First Lord of the Treasurythe last in British history not to have been concurrently prime minister as welland Leader of the House of Commons. After the fall of the government in 1892 he spent three years in opposition. When the Conservatives returned to power, in coalition with the Liberal Unionists, in 1895, Balfour again became Leader of the House and First Lord of the Treasury. His management of the abortive education proposals of 1896 showed a disinclination for the drudgery of parliamentary management, yet he saw the passage of a bill providing Ireland with improved local government under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 and joined in debates on foreign and domestic questions between 1895 and 1900. During the illness of Lord Salisbury in 1898, and again in Salisbury's absence abroad, Balfour was in charge of the Foreign Office, and he conducted negotiations with Russia on the question of railways in North China. As a member of the cabinet responsible for the Transvaal negotiations in 1899, he bore his share of controversy and, when the war began disastrously, he was first to realise the need to use the country's full military strength. His leadership of the House was marked by firmness in the suppression of obstruction, yet there was a slight revival of the criticisms of 1896."

        "content": "With Lord Salisbury's resignation on 11 July 1902, Balfour succeeded him as prime minister, with the approval of all the Unionist party. The new prime minister came into power practically at the same moment as the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra and the end of the South African War. The Liberal party was still disorganised over the Boers. In foreign affairs, Balfour and his foreign secretary, Lord Lansdowne, improved relations with France, culminating in the Entente Cordiale of 1904. The period also saw the Russo-Japanese War, when Britain, an ally of the Japanese, came close to war with Russia after the Dogger Bank incident. On the whole, Balfour left the conduct of foreign policy to Lansdowne, being busy himself with domestic problems. Balfour, who had known Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann since 1906, opposed Russian mistreatment of Jews and increasingly supported Zionism as a programme for European Jews to settle in Palestine. However, in 1905 he supported the Aliens Act 1905, one of whose main objectives was to control and restrict Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe. The budget was certain to show a surplus and taxation could be remitted. Yet as events proved, it was the budget that would sow dissension, override other legislative concerns and signal a new political movement. Charles Thomson Ritchie's remission of the shilling import-duty on corn led to Joseph Chamberlain's crusade in favour of tariff reform. These were taxes on imported goods with trade preference given to the Empire, to protect British industry from competition, strengthen the Empire in the face of growing German and American economic power, and provide revenue, other than raising taxes, for the social welfare legislation. As the session proceeded, the rift grew in the Unionist ranks. Tariff reform was popular with Unionist supporters, but the threat of higher prices for food imports made the policy an electoral albatross. Hoping to split the difference between the free traders and tariff reformers in his cabinet and party, Balfour favoured retaliatory tariffs to punish others who had tariffs against the British, in the hope of encouraging global free trade. This was not sufficient for either the free traders or the extreme tariff reformers in government. With Balfour's agreement, Chamberlain resigned from the Cabinet in late 1903 to campaign for tariff reform. At the same time, Balfour tried to balance the two factions by accepting the resignation of three free-trading ministers, including Chancellor Ritchie, but the almost simultaneous resignation of the free-trader Duke of Devonshire (who as Lord Hartington had been the Liberal Unionist leader of the 1880s) left Balfour's Cabinet weak. By 1905 few Unionist MPs were still free traders (Winston Churchill crossed to the Liberals in 1904 when threatened with deselection at Oldham), but Balfour's act had drained his authority within the government. Balfour resigned as prime minister in December 1905, hoping the Liberal leader Campbell-Bannerman would be unable to form a strong government. This was dashed when Campbell-Bannerman faced down an attempt (\"The Relugas Compact\") to \"kick him upstairs\" to the House of Lords. The Conservatives were defeated by the Liberals at the general election the following January (in terms of MPs, a Liberal landslide), with Balfour losing his seat at Manchester East to Thomas Gardner Horridge, a solicitor and King's Counsel. Only 157 Conservatives were returned to the Commons, at least two-thirds followers of Chamberlain, who chaired the Conservative MPs until Balfour won a safe seat in the City of London."

In foreign policy, the Anglo-French Convention (1904), which formed the basis of the Entente with France. The Education Act lasted four decades and eventually was highly praised. Eugene Rasor states, \"Balfour was credited and much praised from many perspectives with the success [of the 1902 education act]. His commitment to education was fundamental and strong.\" At the time it hurt Balfour because the Liberal party used it to rally their Noncomformist supporters. Ensor said the Act ranked: For most of the 19th century, the very powerful political and economic position of the Church of Ireland (Anglican) landowners blocked the political aspirations of Irish nationalists, who by 1900 included both Catholic and Presbyterian elements. Balfour's solution was to buy them out, not by compulsion, but by offering the owners a full immediate payment and a 12% bonus on the sales price.  The British government purchased 13 million acres (53,000 km2) by 1920, and sold farms to the tenants at low payments spread over seven decades. It would cost money, but all sides proved amenable.  Starting in 1923 the Irish government bought out most of the remaining landowners, and in 1933 diverted payments being made to the British treasury and used them for local improvements. Balfour's introduction of Chinese coolie labour in South Africa enabled the Liberals to counterattack, charging that his measures amounted to \"Chinese slavery\". Likerwise Liberals energized the Nonconformists when they attacked Balfour's Licensing Act 1904 which paid pub owners to close down. In the long run it did reduce the great oversupply of pubs, while in the short run Balfour's party was hurt. Balfour failed to solve his greatest political challengethe debate over tariffs that ripped his party apart. Chamberlain proposed to turn the Empire into a closed trade bloc protected by high tariffs against imports from Germany and the United States. He argued that tariff reform would revive a flagging British economy, strengthen imperial ties with the dominions and the colonies, and produce a positive programme that would facilitate reelection. He was vehemently opposed by Conservative free traders who denounced the proposal as economically fallacious, and open to the charge of raising food prices in Britain. Balfour tried to forestall disruption by removing key ministers on each side, and offering a much narrower tariff programme. It was ingenious, but both sides rejected any compromise, and his party's chances for reelection were ruined. Balfour may have been personally sympathetic to extending suffrage, with his brother Gerald, Conservative MP for Leeds Central married to women's suffrage activist Constance Lytton's sister Betty. But he accepted the strength of the political opposition to women's suffrage, as shown in correspondence with Christabel Pankhurst, a leader of the WSPU. Balfour argued that he was \"not convinced the majority of women actually wanted the vote\", in 1907. A rebuttal which meant extending the activist campaign for women's rights.  He was reminded by Lytton of a speech he made in 1892, namely that this question \"will arise again, menacing and ripe for resolution\", she asked him to meet WSPU leader, Christabel Pankhurst, after a series of hunger strikes and suffering by imprisoned suffragettes in 1907. Balfour refused on the grounds of her militancy. Christabel pleaded direct to meet Balfour as Conservative party leader, on their policy manifesto for the General Election of 1909, but he refused again as women's suffrage was \"not a party question and his colleagues were divided on the matter\". She tried and failed again to get his open support in parliament for women's cause in the 1910 private member's Conciliation Bill. He voted for the bill in the end but not for its progress to the Grand Committee, preventing it becoming law, and extending the activist campaigns as a result again. The following year Lytton and Annie Kenney in person after another reading of the Bill, but again it was not prioritised as government business.  His sister-in-law Lady Betty Balfour spoke to Churchill that her brother was to speak for this policy, and also met the Prime Minister in a 1911 delegation of the women's movements representing the Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association. But it was not until 1918 that (some) women were given the right to vote in elections in the United Kingdom, despite a forty-year campaign. Historians generally praised Balfour's achievements in military and foreign policy.  stress the importance of the Anglo\u2010French Entente of 1904, and the establishment of the Committee of Imperial Defence. Rasor points to twelve historians who have examined his key role in naval and military reforms. However, there was little political payback at the time. The local Conservative campaigns in 1906 focused mostly on a few domestic issues. Balfour gave strong support for Jackie Fisher's naval reforms. Balfour created and chaired the Committee of Imperial Defence, which provided better long-term coordinated planning between the Army and Navy. Austen Chamberlain said Britain would have been unprepared for the World War without his Committee of Imperial Defence. He wrote, \"It is impossible to overrate the services thus rendered by Balfour to the Country and Empire....[Without the CID] victory would have been impossible.\" Historians also praised the Anglo-French Convention (1904), which formed the basis of the Entente Cordiale with France that proved decisive in 1914."

An early attempt to score a debating triumph over the government, made in Balfour's usual abstruse, theoretical style, saw Campbell-Bannerman respond with: \"Enough of this foolery,\" to the delight of his supporters. Balfour made the controversial decision, with Lord Lansdowne, to use the heavily Unionist House of Lords as a check on the political programme and legislation of the Liberal party in the Commons. Legislation was vetoed or altered by amendments between 1906 and 1909, leading David Lloyd George to remark that the Lords was \"the right hon. Gentleman's poodle. It fetches and carries for him. It barks for him. It bites anybody that he sets it on to. And we are told that this is a great revising Chamber, the safeguard of liberty in the country.\" The issue was forced by the Liberals with Lloyd George's People's Budget, provoking the constitutional crisis that led to the Parliament Act 1911, which limited the Lords to delaying bills for up to two years. After the Unionists lost the general elections of 1910 (despite softening the tariff reform policy with Balfour's promise of a referendum on food taxes), the Unionist peers split to allow the Parliament Act to pass the House of Lords, to prevent mass creation of Liberal peers by the new King, George V. The exhausted Balfour resigned as party leader after the crisis, and was succeeded in late 1911 by Bonar Law. Balfour remained important in the party, however, and when the Unionists joined Asquith's coalition government in May 1915, Balfour succeeded Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty. When Asquith's government collapsed in December 1916, Balfour, who seemed a potential successor to the premiership, became foreign secretary in Lloyd George's new administration, but not in the small War Cabinet, and was frequently left out of inner workings of government. Balfour's service as foreign secretary was notable for the Balfour Mission, a crucial alliance-building visit to the US in April 1917, and the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a letter to Lord Rothschild affirming the government's support for the establishment of a \"national home for the Jewish people\" in Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire. Balfour resigned as foreign secretary following the Versailles Conference in 1919, but continued in the government (and the Cabinet after normal peacetime political arrangements resumed) as Lord President of the Council. In 1921\u201322 he represented the British Empire at the Washington Naval Conference and during summer 1922 stood in for the foreign secretary, Lord Curzon, who was ill. He put forward a proposal for the international settlement of war debts and reparations (the Balfour Note), but it was not accepted. On 5 May 1922, Balfour was created Earl of Balfour and Viscount Traprain, of Whittingehame, in the county of Haddington. In October 1922 he, with most of the Conservative leadership, resigned with Lloyd George's government following the Carlton Club meeting, a Conservative back-bench revolt against continuance of the coalition. Bonar Law became prime minister.  Like many Coalition leaders, he did not hold office in the Conservative governments of 1922\u20131924, but as an elder statesman, he was consulted by the King in the choice of Stanley Baldwin as Bonar Law's successor as Conservative leader in May 1923. His advice was strongly in favour of Baldwin, ostensibly due to Baldwin's being an MP but in reality motivated by his personal dislike of Curzon. Later that evening, he met a mutual friend who asked 'Will dear George be chosen?' to which he replied with 'feline Balfourian satisfaction,' 'No, dear George will not.' His hostess replied, 'Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. He will be terribly disappointed.' Balfour retorted, 'Oh, I don't know. After all, even if he has lost the hope of glory he still possesses the means of Grace.' Balfour was not initially included in Baldwin's second government in 1924, but in 1925, he returned to the Cabinet, in place of the late Lord Curzon as Lord President of the Council, until the government ended in 1929. With 28 years of government service, Balfour had one of the longest ministerial careers in modern British politics, second only to Winston Churchill ."

Four years previously he had been the first president of the International Lawn Tennis Club of Great Britain. At the end of 1928, most of his teeth were removed and he suffered the unremitting circulatory trouble which ended his life. Before that, he had suffered occasional phlebitis and, by late 1929, he was immobilised by it.  Balfour died at his brother Gerald's home, Fishers Hill House in Hook Heath, Woking, on 19 March 1930. At his request a public funeral was declined, and he was buried on 22 March beside members of his family at Whittingehame in a Church of Scotland service although he also belonged to the Church of England. By special remainder, his title passed to his brother Gerald. His obituaries in The Times, The Guardian and the Daily Herald did not mention the declaration for which he is most famous outside Britain."

At an exhibition in August 1919, it drew many criticisms; the commission's principal architect, Sir John Burnet said that Balfour's cross, if used in large numbers in cemeteries, would create a criss-cross visual effect, destroying any sense of \"restful diginity\"; Edwin Lutyens called it \"extraordinarily ugly\", and its shape was variously described as resembling a shooting target or bottle. His design was not accepted but the Commission offered him a second chance to submit another design which he did not take up, having been refused once. After a further exhibition in the House of Commons, the \"Balfour cross\" was ultimately rejected in favour of the standard headstone the Commission permanently adopted because the latter offered more space for inscriptions and service emblems."

Balfour was the subject of two parody novels based on Alice in Wonderland, Clara in Blunderland (1902) and Lost in Blunderland (1903), which appeared under the pseudonym Caroline Lewis; one of the co-authors was Harold Begbie. The character Arthur Balfour plays a supporting, off-screen role in Upstairs, Downstairs, promoting the family patriarch, Richard Bellamy, to the position of Civil Lord of the Admiralty. Balfour was portrayed by Adrian Ropes in the 1974 Thames TV production Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill. Balfour was portrayed by Lyndon Brook in the 1975 ATV production Edward the Seventh. A fictionalised version of Arthur Balfour (identified as \"Mr. Balfour\") appears as British prime minister in the science fiction romance The Angel of the Revolution by George Griffith, published in 1893 (when Balfour was still in opposition) but set in an imagined near future of 1903\u20131905. The indecisive Balfour (identified as \"Halfan Halfour\") appears in \"Ministers of Grace\", a satirical short story by Saki in which he, and other leading politicians including Quinston, are changed into animals appropriate to their characters."

Trevelyan: As the prime author of the Education Act, the Licensing Act, Irish Land Purchase and the Committee of Imperial Defence, Balfour has a strong claim to be numbered among the successful Prime Ministers. But Trevelyan admits that, \"owing to the portentous character of the electoral catastrophe of 1906 that claim is not always been allowed; yet Balfour had done great things on his own initiative and by his own strength of character.\"  John L. Gordon pays more attention to the defeats he suffered, stating: Although Balfour's achievements during his brief prime ministry are noteworthy... he is usually seen as an ineffective leader. He was unable to prevent a split in his party over trade policy, and the Unionist-Conservatives suffered a massive defeat in the election of January 1906. Failing to lead his party to victory in the two general elections of 1910, he resigned as leader in 1911. Balfouria, a moshav in northern Israel, along with many streets in Israel, are named after him. The town of Balfour in Mpumalanga, South Africa, was named after him. A portrait of Balfour by Philip de Laszlo is in the collection of Trinity College, Cambridge.

Hnatyshyn was born and educated in Saskatchewan and served in the Royal Canadian Air Force prior to being elected to the House of Commons in 1974. On June 4, 1979, Hnatyshyn was sworn into the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and served as a minister of the Crown in two non-successive governments until 1988. He was appointed governor general by Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II in 1989, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. He replaced Jeanne Mathilde Sauv\u00e9 as viceroy, and occupied the post until succeeded by Rom\u00e9o LeBlanc in 1995. As the Queen's representative, Hnatyshyn proved to be a populist, reversing some exclusive policies of his predecessor, such as by opening up Rideau Hall to ordinary Canadians and tourists alike, and was praised for raising the stature of Ukrainian Canadians. He subsequently practised law and sat as Chancellor of Carleton University before dying of pancreatitis on December 18, 2002."

John practised as a lawyer, but also became involved in politics, running unsuccessfully in three federal elections in the riding of Yorkton before becoming Canada's first Ukrainian-born senator in 1959. John's political links and friendship with John Diefenbaker, the future prime minister, would provide his son with frequent exposure to high-calibre political debate. Ray Hnatyshyn attended Victoria Public School and Nutana Collegiate Institute in Saskatoon, then went on to study at the University of Saskatchewan, earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1954, and a Bachelor of Laws two years later. He was called to the bar of Saskatchewan in 1957 and briefly worked at a Saskatoon law firm, then moved to Ottawa in 1958 to take a position as an assistant to Walter Aseltine, the Government Leader in the Canadian Senate. Hnatyshyn returned to Saskatoon in 1960 and resumed his career as a lawyer. That year, on January 9, he married Karen Gerda Nygaard Andreasen, eventually having and raising two sons with her. In the 1964 Saskatchewan general election, he ran unsuccessfully as a Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan candidate in the electoral district of Saskatoon City. In 1966 he began teaching at the University of Saskatchewan's College of Law as a sessional lecturer, and in 1973 he was appointed Queen's Counsel in Saskatchewan. In his youth, Hnatyshyn enrolled in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, where he was a member of 107 Spitfire Squadron in Saskatoon. He was enlisted as a reservist with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) from 1951 to 1956, then served in the RCAF's 23 Wing (Auxiliary) from 1956 to 1958."

He was appointed the PCs' deputy house leader in 1976. When Saskatoon\u2014Biggar was abolished ahead of the 1979 election, Hnatyshyn followed most of his constituents into the newly established riding of Saskatoon West, where he won re-election. The PCs won a minority government in that election, and Hnatyshyn was appointed on June 4 to the Cabinet chaired by Joe Clark as Minister of Energy, Mines, and Resources, as well as Minister of State for Science and Technology. The PC minority government fell in December 1979, and the Liberals regained power in the subsequent federal election held on February 18, 1980. Hnatyshyn was re-elected MP in Saskatoon West, and was named opposition critic for justice. Brian Mulroney replaced Joe Clark as PC leader following the 1983 leadership election, and named Hnatyshyn Opposition House Leader in April 1984. The PCs won a landslide majority government in the 1984 federal election, and Hnatyshyn was named Government House Leader in November 1984, before adding President of the Privy Council to his portfolio in February 1985.

He was called to the bar of Ontario the same year, and was appointed Queen's Counsel in Canada in 1988. Saskatoon West was abolished before the election of 1988, and Hnatyshyn attempted to follow most of his constituents into Saskatoon\u2014Clark's Crossing, but lost to New Democratic Party challenger Chris Axworthy.

        "content": "On December 14, 1989, Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II, by commission under the royal sign-manual and Great Seal of Canada, appointed Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's choice of Hnatyshyn to succeed Jeanne Sauv\u00e9 as the Queen's representative. He was the second consecutive Saskatchewan-born Governor-General. Hnatyshyn was sworn in during a ceremony in the Senate chamber on January 29, 1990. Hnatyshyn thereafter made an effort to open up Rideau Hall\u2014the monarch's and governor general's residence in Ottawa\u2014to the public, establishing a visitors' centre and initiating guided tours of the palace and the royal park in which it sits. These moves marked a complete reversal of the policies of his predecessor Sauv\u00e9, who had closed Rideau Hall to the general public. In 1991, Hnatyshyn staged on the grounds the first of the annual Governor General's Summer Concert Series and, the year after, mounted His Excellency's Most Excellent Rock Concert and re-opened the skating rink to the public. These events blended with some of Hnatyshyn's self-imposed mandates during his viceregal tenure, which included a desire to engage Canadian youth and focus attention on education and to encourage the arts. To these ends, he established in 1992 the Governor General's Performing Arts Award, the Ramon John Hnatyshyn Award for Voluntarism in the Arts, and the Governor General's Flight For Freedom Award for Lifetime Achievement in Literacy. Further, he founded the International Council for Canadian Studies, the Governor General Ramon John Hnatyshyn Education Fund, the Ramon John Hnatyshyn Award for Law, and the Governor General's International Award for Canadian Studies. Among numerous other official and ceremonial duties, the Governor General presided over celebrations to mark the 125th anniversary of Confederation and welcomed to Rideau Hall the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with a host of foreign dignitaries such as President of Russia Boris Yeltsin and King Hussein and Queen Noor of Jordan. Further, Hnatyshyn undertook a number of state visits, including one to Ukraine, before his time serving at Her Majesty's pleasure ended on February 6, 1995. Throughout his tenure as the Canadian viceroy, Hnatyshyn was both defended and criticised by the Monarchist League of Canada. In their final summary of Hnatyshyn's years in office, though, the former governor general was generally viewed to have not stood up for the Canadian Crown that he represented, choosing to follow, instead of Vincent Massey's example, that of Sauv\u00e9, who was herself seen as a republican. This lack of loyalty, it was argued, left Hnatyshyn with few defenders when he was targeted by members of the Reform Party for his salary and taxes. It was thought by John Pepall that Hnatyshyn's name had been selected by Mulroney to put forward to the Queen for appointment as governor general because Hnatyshyn, who had just recently been a member of the Cabinet headed by Mulroney until losing his parliamentary seat in the 1988 election, was someone Mulroney could \"hardly feel any deference for\", allowing Mulroney to continue to show the \"juvenile extreme of the politician's craving for publicity and centre stage\" he had while Jeanne Sauv\u00e9 was governor general."

In November 2002 he was installed as Chancellor of Carleton University in Ottawa; however, he died of complications from pancreatitis shortly before Christmas that year. Per tradition, and with the consent of his family, Hnatyshyn lay in state for two days in the Senate chamber. Though he was Ukrainian Orthodox, he was commemorated in his state funeral in a multi-faith ceremony on December 23, 2002, at Ottawa's Christ Church Cathedral. The service included the funeral rite of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church\u2014officiated by Archbishop Yurij, Bishop of Toronto, and the clergy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church\u2014and a eulogy from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's chief correspondent, Peter Mansbridge. Adrienne Clarkson, by that time the sitting governor general, paid tribute to him via video, as she and her husband were en route to spend Christmas with Canadian troops stationed in the Persian Gulf. Hnatyshyn was then buried at Beechwood Cemetery in Ottawa. Various memorials followed Hnatyshyn's death: On March 16, 2004, Canada Post unveiled at a ceremony, attended by Hnatyshyn's widow, a $0.49 postage stamp designed by Vancouver graphic artist Susan Mavor, and bearing the formal portrait of Hnatyshyn taken by Canadian Press photographer Paul Chaisson on the day Hnatyshyn became governor general, along with a tone-on-tone rendering of part of Hnatyshyn's coat of arms. Two years later, a 48-minute documentary DVD examining the life of Hnatyshyn, A Man for all Canadians was released in Canada by IKOR Film."

Serving as a lawyer, judge, and politician in the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland, he played a major role in the movement for Finnish independence, because he was one who presented the Declaration of Independence to the Parliament. In 1917\u20131918, Svinhufvud was the first Head of State of independent Finland, first as Chairman of the Senate and subsequently as Protector of State or Regent. He also served as Prime Minister from 1930 to 1931. As a conservative who was strong in his opposition to communism and the Left in general, Svinhufvud did not become a President embraced by all the people, although as the amiable Ukko-Pekka (\"Old Man Pekka\"), he did enjoy wide popularity. Svinhufvud's sharp line as a defender of Finland's legal rights during the period of autonomy was especially valued from the 1920s until the end of the World War II, unlike in later decades. Ever since communism and the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, appreciation of Svinhufvud has begun to increase."

        "content": "Pehr Evind Svinhufvud af Qvalstad was born in S\u00e4\u00e4ksm\u00e4ki. He was the son of Pehr Gustaf Svinhufvud af Qvalstad, a sea captain, and Olga von Becker. His father drowned at sea off Greece in 1863, when Pehr Evind was only two years old. He spent his early childhood at the home of his paternal grandfather, Per Gustaf Svinhufvud af Qvalstad (a provincial treasurer of H\u00e4me), at Rapola, where the family had lived for five generations. The Svinhufvuds (literally translated as \"Swine-head\") are a Finland-Swedish noble family tracing their history back to Dalarna, Sweden. Pehr Gustaf Svinhufvud af Qvalstad, an army lieutenant in the reign of Charles XII, had moved from there to Rapola after the Great Northern War. The family had been ennobled in Sweden in 1574, and it was also introduced to the Finnish House of Nobility in 1818. Rapola was sold when his grandfather shot himself in 1866, and Svinhufvud moved to Helsinki with his mother and his sister. He attended the Swedish-language high school in Helsinki. In 1878, at the age of 16, he enrolled at the Imperial Alexander University of Helsinki. There he gained a Bachelor's degree in 1881, and then completed a Master of Arts degree in 1882; his main subjects being Finnish, Russian and Scandinavian History. After this, he took a Master of Laws degree, graduating in 1886. In 1889, Svinhufvud married Alma (Ellen) Timgren (1869\u20131953). They had six children, Yngve (1890\u20131991), Ilmo Gretel (1892\u20131969), Aino Mary (1893\u20131980), Eino (1896\u20131938), Arne (1904\u20131942), and Veikko (1908\u20131969)."

        "content": "Svinhufvud's career in law followed a regular course: he worked as a lawyer, served at district courts, and served as a deputy judge at the Turku Court of Appeal. In 1892 he was appointed as a member of the Senate's law-drafting committee at the relatively young age of 31. For six years he worked in the committee, initially redrafting taxation laws. As head of his family, Svinhufvud participated as a member of the Estate of Nobles in the Diet of Finland in 1894 and 1899\u20131906. He found his work on the law-drafting committee tedious and moved to the Court of Appeal as an assistant judge in 1902, his long-term goal being the easy life of a rural judge. Svinhufvud stayed mainly in the background until 1899, when Imperial Russia initiated a Russification policy for the autonomous Grand Duchy. The Finnish answer was mainly legislative and constitutional resistance, of which Svinhufvud became a central figure as a judge in the Court of Appeals. When some inhabitants of Helsinki lodged a complaint with the Turku Court of Appeal in 1902, concerning violence employed by the Russian Governor of Uusimaa to break up a demonstration against military call-ups, the court initiated proceedings against Governor-General Bobrikov. Bobrikov demanded that they be stopped, and when this did not happen, he used a decree which the Finns regarded as illegal to dismiss sixteen officials of the court, including Svinhufvud. Originally a moderate of the Finnish Party or Old Finnish Party, after his dismissal Svinhufvud became a strict constitutionalist who regarded the resistance of judges and officials as a question of justice, not believing that political expediency offered compromises. He moved to Helsinki to work as a lawyer and participated in the political activities both of the Diet and of a secret society, Kagal. Svinhufvud played a key role in the birth of a new parliamentary system in 1905 and he was elected as a Young Finnish Party member of the new Parliament in 1906. Svinhufvud went on to serve as a member of Parliament on four occasions (1907\u20131908, 1908\u20131914, 1917, and 1930\u20131931). After being appointed as a judge in Heinola in 1906, he attempted to keep out of the front line of politics. However he was elected Speaker of the Parliament in 1907, largely because the majority Social Democrats considered him \"the best-known opponent of illegality\". Svinhufvud's parliamentary opening speeches, in which he laid emphasis on legality, led to the Tsar dissolving Parliament in both 1909 and 1910. He served as Speaker until 1912. Svinhufvud also served as a judge in Lappee 1908\u20131914. During the First World War Russia replaced various Finnish officials with Russians. Svinhufvud refused to obey the orders of the Russian procurator Konstantin Kazansky, which he considered illegal, and this led to his removal from office as a judge and being exiled to Tomsk in Siberia in November 1914. In his Siberian exile, he spent his time hunting and mending his clothes, still keeping secret contact with the independence movement. When he left Finland, he had promised to return \"with the help of God and Hindenburg\". When news of the February Revolution reached Svinhufvud, he walked to the town's police station and bluntly announced, \"The person who sent me here has been arrested. Now I'm going home.\" In Helsinki he was greeted as a national hero."

        "content": "Svinhufvud was appointed as Chairman of the Senate on 27 November 1917, and was a key figure in the announcement of Finland's declaration of independence on 6 December 1917. He also personally went to Saint Petersburg with Carl Enckell and Gustaf Idman to meet Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, who gave his official recognition of Finnish independence. This is how the meeting is told in Svinhufvud's biography Svinhufvud ja itsen\u00e4isyyssenaatti written by Erkki R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen: Svinhufvud's Senate also authorized General Mannerheim to form a new Finnish army on the basis on White Guard, the (chiefly Rightist) volunteer militia called the Suojeluskunta, an act simultaneously coinciding with the beginning of the Civil War in Finland. During the Civil War, Svinhufvud went underground in Helsinki and sent pleas for intervention to Germany and Sweden. The conflict also turned him into an active monarchist, though not a royalist. In March 1918 he managed to escape via Berlin-Stockholm to the Senate, now located in Vaasa, where he resumed his function as Head of Government. In this role he pardoned 36,000 Red prisoners in the autumn of 1918. On 18 May, Svinhufvud became Protector of State or Regent, retaining this post as Head of State after he stood down as Chairman of the Senate on 27 May. After Germany's defeat in World War I, and the failed attempt to make Finland a Monarchy under the King of Finland (Frederick Charles of Hesse was elected), Svinhufvud withdrew from public life and was active only in the anti-communist Suojeluskunta-militia."

        "title": "Pehr Evind Svinhufvud_Prime Minister and President",
        "content": "In 1925 he was the Presidential candidate for the conservative Kokoomus party, but was not elected. After the emergence of the anti-communist Lapua Movement, President Relander appointed him as Prime Minister of Finland on the Lapua Movement's insistence. Svinhufvud was elected President in 1931, and appointed Mannerheim as Chairman of the Defence Council, not least of all as an answer to the Lapua Movement's fear of having fought the Civil War in vain. He resisted both communist agitation and the Lapua Movement's exploits. All Communist members of parliament were arrested. In February 1932 there was a so-called M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 Rebellion, when the Suojeluskunta-Militia and the Lapua Movement demanded the Cabinet's resignation. The turning point came with the President's broadcast radio speech, in which he called on the rebels to surrender and ordered all Civil Guard members who were heading for M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 to return to their homes: His speech stopped the rebellion before anything serious happened. Svinhufvud was not a supporter of Parliamentarism, or to put it differently, he believed that the President had a right to choose the Cabinet ministers after first consulting the parliamentary parties. Evidence of this semi-presidential attitude was the minority government of Toivo M. Kivim\u00e4ki, which survived for 3 years and 10 months (December 1932 \u2013 October 1936). Svinhufvud strongly supported it, because he believed that it could effectively fight the Great Depression (which it did, generally speaking), he believed that Kivim\u00e4ki had a strong personality like himself, and possibly because he hoped that the Agrarians and Swedish People's Party would let the Kivim\u00e4ki government remain in office as a lesser evil, the greater evil being an Agrarian-Social Democratic government. On the other hand, when a right-wing Conservative member of Parliament, Edwin Linkomies, proposed in 1934 that Finland abandon parliamentarism in favour of a government led by the President and that the President be given an absolute veto power over the laws passed by the Parliament, Svinhufvud opposed his ideas. In Svinhufvud's opinion, the Finnish President had enough power to lead the country, provided that the President had a strong personality. He believed it to be better for Finland if the Social Democrats could be kept outside of the Cabinet. In his opinion, they would implement too radical reforms that would lead the Finnish society into chaos or Marxism. On the other hand, he was realistic enough to admit privately to the German Ambassador to Finland, Wipert von Bl\u00fccher, that if he was re-elected, he would be unable to keep the Social Democrats in the opposition. They were, after all, Finland's largest political party with over 40% of the deputies (see, for example, Seppo Zetterberg et al., ed., \"A Small Giant of the Finnish History\" / Suomen historian pikkuj\u00e4ttil\u00e4inen, Helsinki: Werner S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m Publications Ltd., 2003; Virkkunen, \"The Finnish Presidents I\"). It was due to this that, in the Presidential election of 1937, the Social Democrats and the Agrarian party voted against him. He was not re-elected. At the end of Winter War, he unsuccessfully sought audience with both Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini but met only Pope Pius XII. During the Continuation War he supported the idea of an expansionistic war. Svinhufvud's most important and beloved hobbies were hunting and precision shooting. His grandson Jorma Svinhufvud describes: Svinhufvud died at Luum\u00e4ki in 1944, while Finland was seeking peace with the Soviet Union. He refused to Finnicize the name of his 500-year-old noble house."

Breyer served as a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States between 1990 and 1994 and the United States Sentencing Commission between 1985 and 1989. On the sentencing commission he played a key role in reforming federal criminal sentencing procedures, producing the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which were formulated to increase uniformity in sentencing."

But after the retirement of Harry Blackmun, Clinton nominated Breyer as an associate justice of the Supreme Court on May 17, 1994. Breyer was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, 1994, by an 87 to 9 vote, and received his commission on August 3. He was the second-longest-serving junior justice in the history of the Court, close to surpassing the record set by Associate Justice Joseph Story of 4,228 days (from February 3, 1812, to September 1, 1823); Breyer fell 29 days short of tying this record, which he would have reached on March 1, 2006, had Samuel Alito not joined the Court on January 31, 2006. Since Ginsburg's death in September 2020, Breyer has been the oldest serving justice. In 2015, Breyer broke a federal law that bans judges from hearing cases when they or their spouses or minor children have a financial interest in a company involved. His wife sold about $33,000 worth of stock in Johnson Controls a day after Breyer participated in the oral argument. This brought him back into compliance and he joined the majority in ruling in favor of the interests of a Johnson Controls subsidiary which was party to FERC v. Electric Power Supply Ass'n."

In an August 2021 New York Times interview, Breyer said he wished to retire before his death, and recounted a conversation he had with Justice Antonin Scalia in which Scalia mentioned that he did not want his successor to \"reverse everything I've done for the last 25 years\". Breyer said that Scalia's point will \"inevitably be in the psychology\" of his decision to retire. In a September 2021 interview with Fox News'''s Chris Wallace, Breyer said activists calling for his resignation are \"entitled to their opinion\" and \"I didn\u2019t retire because I had decided on balance I wouldn\u2019t retire\". He said he took several factors into account when deciding his retirement plans, and reiterated that he did not plan to \"die on the court\". On January 26, 2022, news outlets reported Breyer's intention to retire from the court at the end of the 2021\u201322 term. Breyer confirmed his pending retirement in a White House announcement alongside Biden on January 27.

In a mostly concurring opinion, he wrote: \"Yet the decision was ill considered in a number of critically important respects. The Secretary did not give adequate consideration to issues that should have been central to his judgment, such as the high likelihood of an undercount, the low likelihood that a question would yield more accurate citizenship data, and the apparent lack of any need for more accurate citizenship data to begin with. The Secretary\u2019s failures in considering those critical issues make his decision unreasonable\". On December 18, 2020, Breyer was one of three dissenters in Trump v. New York. In a 20-page dissent, he argued that the Court should not have sidestepped the case and should have ruled in favor of the challengers, who wanted the Court to block the Trump administration's last-minute attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census. The census ultimately did not exclude undocumented immigrants, due to a lack of time and the subsequent issuance of Executive Order 13986."

In his 28-page dissent, Breyer argued that the 20-year retroactive extension of existing copyright granted by the Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA) amounted effectively to a grant of perpetual copyright that violated the Copyright Clause of the Constitution, read in light of the First Amendment. He argued that the extension would produce a period of protection worth more than 99.8% of protection in perpetuity and that few artists would be more inclined to produce work knowing that their great-grandchildren would receive royalties. He also wrote that the fair use defense came to no avail either, as it could not help \"those who wish to obtain from electronic databases material that is not there\", e.g. teachers who can find from online no ideal material to be used in the class as it has been deleted. In Google v. Oracle, decided on April 5, 2021, Breyer wrote the 38-page majority opinion, holding that Google's copying of 11,500 lines of Java declaring code (0.4% of all Java code) constituted fair use because \"three of these packages were ... fundamental to being able to use the Java language at all\". Breyer explained, \"By using the same declaring code for those packages, programmers using the Android platform can rely on the method calls that they are already familiar with to call up particular tasks (e.g., determining which of two integers is the greater); but Google's own implementing programs carry out those tasks. Without that copying, programmers would need to learn an entirely new system to call up the same tasks.\""

On April 23, 2020, Breyer wrote the majority opinion in County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund. The Court ruled that the County of Maui must have a permit under the Clean Water Act in order to release groundwater pollution into the ocean. Although the ruling was less broad than the 9th Circuit's ruling, environmentalist groups saw the ruling as a win and an affirmation of the Clean Water Act.

The case concerned the Sierra Club's request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for \"draft opinions\" concerning rules governing underwater structures that are used to cool industrial equipment. The Sierra Club argued that it had the right to access the documents. The majority opinion limits environmental groups' ability to obtain government documents under FOIA. Breyer wrote in his dissent, \"Agency practice shows that the Draft Biological Opinion, not the Final Biological Opinion, is the document that informs the EPA of the Services\u2019 conclusions about jeopardy and alternatives and triggers within the EPA the process of deciding what to do about those conclusions. If a Final Biological Opinion is discoverable under FOIA, as all seem to agree it is, why would a Draft Biological Opinion, embodying the same Service conclusions (and leaving the EPA with the same four choices), not be?\u201d In Hollyfrontier Cheyenne Refining v.

        "content": "Breyer's pragmatic approach to the law \"will tend to make the law more sensible\", according to Cass Sunstein, who added that Breyer's \"attack on originalism is powerful and convincing\". Breyer has consistently voted in favor of abortion rights,Stenberg v. Carhart, . one of the most controversial areas of the Supreme Court's docket. He has also defended the Court's use of foreign law and international law as persuasive (but not binding) authority in its decisions. Breyer is also recognized to be deferential to the interests of law enforcement and to legislative judgments in the Court's First Amendment rulings. He has demonstrated a consistent pattern of deference to Congress, voting to overturn congressional legislation at a lower rate than any other Justice since 1994. Breyer's extensive experience in administrative law is accompanied by his staunch defense of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Breyer rejects the strict interpretation of the Sixth Amendment espoused by Justice Scalia that all facts necessary to criminal punishment must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In many other areas on the Court, too, Breyer's pragmatism was considered the intellectual counterweight to Scalia's textualist philosophy. In describing his interpretive philosophy, Breyer has sometimes noted his use of six interpretive tools: text, history, tradition, precedent, the purpose of a statute, and the consequences of competing interpretations. He has noted that only the last two differentiate him from textualists such as Scalia. Breyer argues that these sources are necessary, however, and in the former case (purpose), can in fact provide greater objectivity in legal interpretation than looking merely at what is often ambiguous statutory text. With the latter (consequences), Breyer argues that considering the impact of legal interpretations is a further way of ensuring consistency with a law's intended purpose."

        "doc_id": "69_18002",
        "title": "Stephen Breyer_Active Liberty",
        "content": "Breyer expounded his judicial philosophy in 2005 in Active Liberty: Interpreting Our Democratic Constitution. In it, Breyer urges judges to interpret legal provisions (of the Constitution or of statutes) in light of the purpose of the text and how well the consequences of specific rulings fit those purposes. The book is considered a response to the 1997 book A Matter of Interpretation, in which Antonin Scalia emphasized adherence to the original meaning of the text alone. In Active Liberty, Breyer argues that the Framers of the Constitution sought to establish a democratic government involving the maximum liberty for its citizens. Breyer refers to Isaiah Berlin\u2019s Two Concepts of Liberty. The first Berlinian concept, being what most people understand by liberty, is \"freedom from government coercion\". Berlin termed this \"negative liberty\" and warned against its diminution; Breyer calls this \"modern liberty\". The second Berlinian concept\u00a0\u2013 \"positive liberty\"\u00a0\u2013 is the \"freedom to participate in the government\". In Breyer's terminology, this is the \"active liberty\" the judge should champion. Having established what \"active liberty\" is, and positing the primary importance (to the Framers) of this concept over the competing idea of \"negative liberty\", Breyer makes a predominantly utilitarian case for rulings that give effect to the democratic intentions of the Constitution. The book's historical premises and practical prescriptions have been challenged. For example, according to Peter Berkowitz, the reason that \"[t]he primarily democratic nature of the Constitution's governmental structure has not always seemed obvious\", as Breyer puts it, is \"because it's not true, at least in Breyer's sense, that the Constitution elevates active liberty above modern [negative] liberty\". Breyer's position \"demonstrates not fidelity to the Constitution\", Berkowitz argues, \"but rather a determination to rewrite the Constitution's priorities\". Berkowitz suggests that Breyer is also inconsistent in failing to apply this standard to the issue of abortion, instead preferring decisions \"that protect women's modern liberty, which remove controversial issues from democratic discourse\". Failing to answer the textualist charge that the Living Documentarian judge is a law unto himself, Berkowitz argues that Active Liberty \"suggests that when necessary, instead of choosing the consequence that serves what he regards as the Constitution's leading purpose, Breyer will determine the Constitution\u2019s leading purpose on the basis of the consequence that he prefers to vindicate\". Against the last charge, Cass Sunstein has defended Breyer, noting that of the nine justices on the Rehnquist Court, Breyer had the highest percentage of votes to uphold acts of Congress and also to defer to the decision of the executive branch. However, according to Jeffrey Toobin in The New Yorker, \"Breyer concedes that a judicial approach based on 'active liberty' will not yield solutions to every constitutional debate\", and that, in Breyer's words, \"respecting the democratic process does not mean you abdicate your role of enforcing the limits in the Constitution, whether in the Bill of Rights or in separation of powers.\" To this point, and from a discussion at the New York Historical Society in March 2006, Breyer has noted that \"democratic means\" did not bring about an end to slavery, or the concept of \"one man, one vote\", which allowed corrupt and discriminatory (but democratically inspired) state laws to be overturned in favor of civil rights."

        "content": "In 2010, Breyer published a second book, Making Our Democracy Work: A Judge's View. There, Breyer argued that judges have six tools they can use to determine a legal provision's proper meaning: (1) its text; (2) its historical context; (3) precedent; (4) tradition; (5) its purpose; and (6) the consequences of potential interpretations. Textualists, like Scalia, only feel comfortable using the first four of these tools; while pragmatists, like Breyer, believe that \"purpose\" and \"consequences\" are particularly important interpretative tools. Breyer cites several watershed moments in Supreme Court history to show why the consequences of a particular ruling should always be in a judge's mind. He notes that President Jackson ignored the Court's ruling in Worcester v. Georgia, which led to the Trail of Tears and severely weakened the Court's authority. He also cites the Dred Scott decision, an important precursor to the American Civil War. When the Court ignores the consequences of its decisions, Breyer argues, it can lead to devastating and destabilizing outcomes. In 2015, Breyer released a third book, The Court and the World: American Law and the New Global Realities, examining the interplay between U.S. and international law and how the realities of a globalized world need to be considered in U.S. cases."

In 1832, Wilde was bound as an apprentice to Abraham Colles, the pre-eminent Irish surgeon of the day, at Dr Steevens' Hospital in Dublin. He was also taught by the surgeons James Cusack and Sir Philip Crampton and the physician Sir Henry Marsh. Wilde also studied at the private and highly respected school of anatomy, medicine, and surgery in Park Street (later Lincoln Place), Dublin. In 1837, he earned his medical degree from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. In the same year, Wilde embarked on an eight-month-cruise to the Holy Land with a recovering patient, visiting various cities and islands throughout the Mediterranean. Porpoises were flung on board the ship, Crusader, and Wilde dissected them. Taking notes, he eventually composed a two-volume book on the nursing habits of the creatures. Among the places he visited on this tour was Egypt. In a tomb he found the mummified remains of a dwarf and salvaged the torso to bring back to Ireland. He also collected embalmed ibises. Once back in Ireland, Wilde published an article in the Dublin University Magazine suggesting that one of the \"Cleopatra's Needles\" be transported to England (eventually in 1878 one of the Needles was transported to London, and in 1880 the other one was brought to New York's Central Park). In 1873 he was awarded the Cunningham Gold Medal by the Royal Irish Academy."

Wilde had a very successful medical practice and was assisted in it by his natural son, Henry Wilson, who had been trained in Dublin, Vienna, Heidelberg, Berlin, and Paris. Wilson's presence enabled Wilde to travel and he visited Scandinavia, where he received an honorary degree from Uppsala, and was welcomed in Stockholm by Anders Retzius, among others. King Karl XV of Sweden conferred on him the Nordstj\u00e4rneorden (Order of the North Star). In 1853,  he was appointed Surgeon Occulist in Ordinary to the Queen in Ireland, the first position of its kind, probably created for him. He was awarded a knighthood in a ceremony at Dublin Castle on 28 January 1864 more for his involvement with the Irish census than for his medical contributions, although he had been appointed medical commissioner to the Irish census in 1841.

Legal costs of \u00a32,000 were awarded against Lady Wilde. The case was the talk of all Dublin, and Wilde's refusal to enter the witness box during the trial was widely held against him as ungentlemanly behaviour. From this time onwards, Wilde began to withdraw from Dublin to the west of Ireland, where he had started in 1864 to build what became Moytura, his house overlooking Lough Corrib in Connemara. He died aged 61 in 1876, and is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery in Dublin."

        "content": "Darren Aronofsky (born February 12, 1969) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. His films are noted for their surrealism, melodramatic, and disturbing elements, often based in psychological fictions. Aronofsky attended Harvard University, where he studied film and social anthropology, and then the American Film Institute where he studied directing. He won several film awards after completing his senior thesis film, Supermarket Sweep, which went on to become a National Student Academy Award finalist. Aronofsky's feature debut, the surrealist psychological thriller Pi, was shot in November 1997. The low-budget, $60,000 production, starring Sean Gullette, was sold to Artisan Entertainment for $1 million, and grossed over $3 million; Aronofsky won the Directing Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay. Aronofsky's follow-up, the psychological drama Requiem for a Dream, was based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby Jr. The film garnered strong reviews and received an Academy Award nomination for Ellen Burstyn's performance. After writing the World War II horror film Below, Aronofsky began production on his third film, the romantic fantasy sci-fi drama The Fountain. The film received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box-office, but has since garnered a cult following. His fourth film, the sports drama The Wrestler, was released to critical acclaim and both of the film's stars, Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei, received Academy Award nominations. In 2010, his fifth feature film, the psychological horror film Black Swan, received further critical acclaim and many accolades, being nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director; Natalie Portman won Best Actress for her performance in the film. Aronofsky also received nominations for Best Director at the Golden Globes, and a Directors Guild of America Award nomination for his work on Black Swan. Aronofsky's sixth film, the biblically inspired epic Noah, was released in 2014, becoming Aronofsky's first film to open at No.1 at the box office. His seventh film, the psychological horror mother! (2017), sparked controversy upon release due to its biblical allegories and depiction of violence, and polarized audiences."

        "content": "Aronofsky was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, the son of teachers Charlotte and Abraham Aronofsky, and grew up in the borough's Manhattan Beach neighborhood. He said he was \"raised culturally Jewish, but there was very little spiritual attendance in temple. It was a cultural thing\u2014celebrating the holidays, knowing where you came from, knowing your history, having respect for what your people have been through.\" He graduated from Edward R. Murrow High School. He has one sister, Patti, who attended a professional ballet school through high school. His parents would often take him to Broadway theatre performances, which sparked his keen interest in show business. During his youth, he trained as a field biologist with The School for Field Studies in Kenya in 1985 and Alaska in 1986. He attended school in Kenya to pursue an interest in learning about ungulates. He later said, \"[T]he School for Field Studies changed the way I perceived the world\". Aronofsky's interest in the outdoors led him to backpack his way through Europe and the Middle East. At the age of 18, he entered Harvard University, where he majored in social anthropology and studied filmmaking; he graduated in 1991. He became seriously interested in film while attending Harvard after befriending Dan Schrecker, an aspiring animator, and Sean Gullette, who would go on to star in Aronofsky's first film, Pi. His cinematic influences included Akira Kurosawa, Roman Polanski, Terry Gilliam, Shinya Tsukamoto, Hubert Selby Jr. Spike Lee, Satoshi Kon, and Jim Jarmusch. Aronofsky's senior thesis film, Supermarket Sweep, was a finalist in the 1991 Student Academy Awards. In 1992, Aronofsky received his MFA degree in directing from the AFI Conservatory, where his classmates included Todd Field, Doug Ellin, Scott Silver and Mark Waters. He won the institute's Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal."

        "content": "Aronofsky's debut feature, titled Pi\u2014sometimes stylized as \u03c0\u2014was shot in November 1997. The film was financed in part from $100 donations from 600 of his friends and family. In return, he promised to pay each back $150 if the film made money, and they would at least get screen credit if the film lost money. Producing the film with an initial budget of $60,000, Aronofsky premiered Pi at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, where he won the Best Director award. The film itself was nominated for a special Jury Award. Artisan Entertainment bought distribution rights for $1 million. The film was released to the public later that year to critical acclaim and it grossed a total of $3,221,152 at the box-office. Pi was the first film to be made available for download on the Internet. Aronofsky followed his debut with Requiem for a Dream, a film based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel of the same name. He was paid $50,000, and worked for three years with nearly the same production team as his previous film. Following the financial breakout of Pi, he was capable of hiring established actors, including Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, and received a budget of $3,500,000 to produce the film. Production of the film occurred over the period of one year, with the film being released in October 2000. The film went on to gross $7,390,108 worldwide. Aronofsky received acclaim for his stylish direction, and was nominated for another Independent Spirit Award, this time for Best Director. The film itself was nominated for five awards in total, winning two, for Best Actress and Cinematography. Clint Mansell's soundtrack for the film was also well-regarded, and since their first collaboration in 1996, Mansell has composed the music to every Aronofsky film, (except for Mother!, 2017). Ellen Burstyn was nominated for numerous awards, including for an Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the Independent Spirit Award. Aronofsky was awarded the PRISM Award from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation with the National Institute on Drug Abuse for the film's depiction of drug abuse. In May 2000, Aronofsky was briefly attached to make an adaptation of David Wiesner's 1999 children's book Sector 7 for Nickelodeon Movies, the project remains unmade. In mid-2000, Warner Bros. hired Aronofsky to write and direct Batman: Year One, which was to be the fifth film in the Batman franchise. Aronofsky, who collaborated with Frank Miller on an unproduced script for Ronin, brought Miller to co-write Year One with him, intending to reboot the series. \"It's somewhat based on the comic book\", Aronofsky later said. \"Toss out everything you can imagine about Batman! Everything! We're starting completely anew\", who intended to re-imagine the titular character in a darker, adult-oriented and grounded style, with his adaptation aiming for an R-rating. Regular Aronofsky collaborator Matthew Libatique was set as cinematographer, and Aronofsky had also approached Christian Bale for the role of Batman. Bale later would be cast in the role for Batman Begins. After that project failed to develop, Aronofsky declined the opportunity to direct an entry in the Batman franchise. In March 2001, he helped write the screenplay to the horror film Below, which he also produced. In April 2001, Aronofsky entered negotiations with Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow to direct a then-untitled science fiction film, with Brad Pitt in the lead role. In June 2001, actress Cate Blanchett entered talks to join the film, which Aronofsky, wanting the title to remain secret, had given the working title of The Last Man. Production was postponed to wait for a pregnant Blanchett to give birth to her child in December 2001. Production was ultimately set for late October 2002 in Queensland and Sydney. By now officially titled The Fountain, the film had a budget of $70 million, co-financed by Warner Bros. and New Regency, which had filled the gap after Village Roadshow withdrew. Pitt left the project seven weeks before the first day of shooting, halting production. In February 2004, Warner Bros. resurrected it on a $35 million budget with Hugh Jackman in the lead role. In August, actress Rachel Weisz filled the vacancy left by Blanchett. The Fountain was released on November 22, 2006, a day before the American Thanksgiving holiday; ultimately it grossed $15,978,422 in theaters worldwide. Audiences and critics were divided in their responses to it."

        "content": "In 2007, Aronofsky hired writer Scott Silver to develop The Fighter with him. He had approached actor Christian Bale for the film, but Aronofsky dropped out because of its similarities to The Wrestler and to work on MGM's RoboCop remake. In July 2010, Aronofsky had left the project due to uncertainty over the financially distressed studio's future. When asked about the film, he said, \"I think I'm still attached. I don't know. I haven't heard from anyone in a while\". Later during 2007, Aronofsky said he was planning to film a movie about Noah's Ark. Aronofsky had the idea for The Wrestler for over a decade. He hired Robert Siegel (filmmaker) to turn his idea into a script. The actor Nicolas Cage entered negotiations in October 2007 to star as Randy, the film's protagonist. The following month Cage left the project, and Mickey Rourke replaced him in the lead role. Aronofsky said that Cage pulled out of the movie because Aronofsky wanted Rourke to star; Aronofsky said, stating that Cage was \"a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but, you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race.\" Cage responded, \"I wasn't quote 'dropped' from the movie. I resigned from the movie because I didn't think I had enough time to achieve the look of the wrestler who was on steroids, which I would never do\". The roughly 40-day shoot began in January 2008. The Wrestler premiered at the 65th Venice International Film Festival. Initially receiving little attention, the film wound up winning the Golden Lion, the highest award at the world's oldest film festival. The Wrestler received critical acclaim, and both Rourke and co-star Marisa Tomei received Academy Award, Golden Globe, SAG, and BAFTA nominations for their performances. Rourke won a Golden Globe, as did Bruce Springsteen for his original song written for the film. The Wrestler grossed $44,674,354 worldwide on a budget of $6,000,000 making it Aronofsky's highest-grossing film to that point. Aronofsky's next film was Black Swan, which had been in development since 2001, a psychological thriller horror film about a New York City ballerina. The film starred actress Natalie Portman, whom Aronofsky had known since 2000. She introduced Aronofsky to Mila Kunis, who joined the cast in 2009. Black Swan had its world premiere as the opening film at the 67th Venice Film Festival in September 2010. It received a standing ovation whose length Variety said made it \"one of the strongest Venice openers in recent memory\". Black Swan has received high praise from film critics, and received a record 12 Broadcast Film Critics Association nominations, four Independent Spirit Award nominations, four Golden Globe nominations, three SAG nominations, and many more accolades. Aronofsky received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Director. The film broke limited-release box-office records and grossed an unexpectedly high $329,398,046. On January 25, 2011, the film was nominated for a total of five Academy Awards; Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing. On February 27, 2011, Portman won for Best Actress. The film was awarded the PRISM Award from the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration for its depiction of mental health issues. Aronofsky served as an executive producer on The Fighter, which was also nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars and won two for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress for Christian Bale and Melissa Leo."

        "content": "Aronofsky was attached to The Wolverine, which was scheduled to begin production in March 2011, but he left the project due to scheduling issues. The film was set to be sixth entry of the X-Men film series, featuring a story revolving around Wolverine's adventures in Japan. In December 2011, Aronofsky directed the music video for Lou Reed and Metallica's \"The View\" from their album Lulu. Aronofsky was set to direct an HBO series pilot called Hobgoblin. Announced on June 16, 2011, the series would have depicted a group of magicians and con artists who use their powers of deception to defeat Hitler during World War II. He was set to work on the project with Pulitzer Prize winning author Michael Chabon and his wife Ayelet Waldman. In June 2013, it was announced that HBO had dropped the show and Aronofsky had pulled out, as well. In 2011, Aronofsky tried to launch production on Noah, a retelling of the Bible story of Noah's Ark, projected for a $115 million budget. By the following year, the film had secured funding and distribution from New Regency and Paramount Pictures, with Russell Crowe hired for the title role. The film was adapted into a serialized graphic novel written by Aronofsky and Ari Handel, published in French in October 2011 by the Belgian publisher Le Lombard. By July 2012, Aronofsky's crews were building an ark set in Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York. Aronofsky announced the start of filming on Noah on Twitter in the same month, tweeting shots of the filming in Iceland. The film featured Emma Watson, Anthony Hopkins, Logan Lerman, and Jennifer Connelly, with the latter having also starred in Requiem for a Dream. During its opening weekend, Noah held the largest non-sequel opening within Russia and Brazil, and the fourth-largest opening of all time. Aronofsky did not use live animals for the film, saying in a PETA video that \"There's really no reason to do it anymore because the technology has arrived\". The HSUS gave him their inaugural Humane Filmmaker Award in honor of his use of computer-generated animals. Aronofsky's next film, mother!, was released by Paramount Pictures on September 15, 2017. It stars Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Michelle Pfeiffer, Domhnall Gleeson, Ed Harris and Kristen Wiig. The film sparked controversy upon release for its depiction of violence, and, though it received generally positive reviews, it polarized audiences, becoming one of few films to receive a \"F\" CinemaScore grade. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 69% based on 278 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"There's no denying that mother! is the thought-provoking product of a singularly ambitious artistic vision, though it may be too unwieldy for mainstream tastes.\" His next film would be \"A courtroom drama of Artificial intelligence\", in which he would cooperate again with Paramount Pictures, having doing so in mother!. In 2018, he was the co-executive producer of SPHERES, a virtual reality journey through the universe, that was acquired in a seven figure deal at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. In January 2021, his next film was announced to be The Whale, a film adaptation of Samuel D. Hunter's play of the same name, starring Brendan Fraser."

        "content": "Aronofsky's first two films, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, were low budget and used montages of extremely short shots, also known as hip hop montages. While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts Requiem for a Dream features more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with extremely tight closeups. Long tracking shots, including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam, and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices. Often with his films, Aronofsky alternates between extreme closeups and extreme wide shots to create a sense of isolation. With The Fountain, Aronofsky restricted the use of computer-generated imagery. Henrik Fett, the visual effects supervisor of Look Effects, said, \"Darren was quite clear on what he wanted and his intent to greatly minimize the use of computer graphics\u00a0... and I think the results are outstanding.\" He used more subtle directing in The Wrestler and Black Swan, in which a less-visceral directing style better showcases the acting and narratives. Aronofsky filmed both works with a muted palette and a grainy style. Part of this consistent style involves collaborations with frequent partners cinematographer Matthew Libatique, editor Andrew Weisblum and composer Clint Mansell. Mansell's music is often an important element of the films."

        "content": "Pi features several references to mathematics and mathematical theories. In a 1998 interview, Aronofsky acknowledged several influences for Pi: \"I'm a big fan of Kurosawa and Fellini. In this film in particular I think there's a lot of Roman Polanski influence and Terry Gilliam influence as well as a Japanese director named Shinya Tsukamoto\u2014he directed The Iron Man, Tetsuo.\" The visual style of Pi and Requiem for a Dream features numerous similarities to Tetsuo: The Iron Man. The majority of reviewers characterized Requiem for a Dream in the genre of \"drug movies\", along with films like The Basketball Diaries, Trainspotting, Spun, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. But, Aronofsky placed his movie in a wider context, saying: Dream logic is another leitmotif. With his friend Ari Handel, Aronofsky developed the plot for The Fountain; the director wrote the screenplay. In 1999, Aronofsky thought that The Matrix redefined the science fiction genre in film. He sought to make a science fiction film that explored new territory, as did The Matrix and its predecessors Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey. He wanted to go beyond science fiction films with plots driven by technology and science. In the Toronto International Film Festival interview conducted by James Rocchi, Aronofsky credited the 1957 Charles Mingus song \"The Clown\" as a major influence on The Wrestler. It is an instrumental piece, with a poem read over the music about a clown who accidentally discovers the bloodlust of the crowds and eventually kills himself in performance. Aronofsky called Black Swan a companion piece to The Wrestler, recalling one of his early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina. He eventually separated the wrestling and the ballet worlds, considering them as \"too much for one movie\". He compared the two films: \"Wrestling some consider the lowest art\u2014if they would even call it art\u2014and ballet some people consider the highest art. But what was amazing to me was how similar the performers in both of these worlds are. They both make incredible use of their bodies to express themselves.\" About the psychological thriller nature of Black Swan, actress Natalie Portman compared the film's tone to Polanski's 1968 film Rosemary's Baby, while Aronofsky said Polanski's Repulsion (1965) and The Tenant (1976) were \"big influences\" on the final film. Actor Vincent Cassel also compared Black Swan to Polanski's early films, commenting that it was also influenced by Alejandro Jodorowsky's movies and David Cronenberg's early work."

Requiem for a Dream was originally set for release in 2000, but it met with controversy in the United States, being rated NC-17 by the MPAA due to a graphic sex scene. Aronofsky appealed the rating, claiming that cutting any portion of the film would dilute its message. The appeal was denied and the film's distributor Artisan Entertainment decided to release the film unrated. The question of who had designed 40 ballet costumes for Portman and the dancers in Black Swan was one publicized controversy related to the film. The media gave substantial coverage to the dance double controversy: how much credit for the dancing in the film was being given to Portman and how much to her \"dance double\", Sarah Lane, an American Ballet Theatre soloist. Lane claimed to have danced more than she was credited. The director and Fox Searchlight disputed Lane's claim. Their released statements said, \"We were fortunate to have Sarah there to cover the more complicated dance sequences and we have nothing but praise for the hard work she did.

Bolin was involved in organising use of the new satellite tools for climate research, which led to the formation of the ICSU Committee on Atmospheric Sciences (CAS) in 1964, with Bolin becoming its first Chairman. CAS started the Global Atmospheric Research Programme (GARP) in 1967, which Bolin also chaired; GARP became the World Climate Research Programme in 1980. Bolin served on the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases from 1985.  In 1987, the 500-page Brundtland Report which Bolin was involved with contributed to the setting up of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Under his chairmanship (from 1988 to 1997), the IPCC produced its First Assessment Report (1990) and Second Assessment Report (1995), contributing to the IPCC sharing the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former US Vice President Al Gore. Bolin was asked to accept the Prize on behalf of the IPCC, but was too ill to attend. Bolin is credited with bringing together a diverse range of views among the panel's 3,500 scientists into something resembling a consensus.

        "content": "Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, 1st Earl of Midlothian,  (7 May 1847 \u2013 21 May 1929) was a British Liberal politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from March 1894 to June 1895. Between the death of his father, in 1851, and the death of his grandfather, the 4th Earl of Rosebery, in 1868, he was known by the courtesy title of Lord Dalmeny. Rosebery first came to national attention in 1879 by sponsoring the successful Midlothian campaign of William Ewart Gladstone. He briefly was in charge of Scottish affairs. His most successful performance in office came as chairman of the London County Council in 1889. He entered the cabinet in 1885 and served twice as foreign minister, paying special attention to French and German affairs. He succeeded Gladstone as prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party in 1894; the Liberals lost the 1895 election. He resigned the party leadership in 1896 and never again held political office. Rosebery was widely known as a brilliant orator, an outstanding sportsman and marksman, a writer and historian, connoisseur and collector. All of these activities attracted him more than politics, which grew boring and unattractive. Furthermore, he drifted to the right of the Liberal party and became a bitter critic of its policies. Winston Churchill, observing that he never adapted to democratic electoral competition, quipped: \"He would not stoop; he did not conquer.\" Rosebery was a Liberal Imperialist who favoured strong national defence and imperialism abroad and social reform at home, while being solidly anti-socialist. Historians judge him a failure as foreign minister and as prime minister."

        "content": "Archibald Philip Primrose was born on 7 May 1847 in his parents' house in Charles Street, Mayfair, London. His father was Archibald Primrose, Lord Dalmeny (1809\u20131851), son and heir apparent to Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery (1783\u20131868), whom he predeceased. Lord Dalmeny was a courtesy title used by the Earl's eldest son and heir apparent, during the Earl's lifetime, and was one of the Earl's lesser Scottish titles. Lord Dalmeny (died 1851) was MP for Stirling from 1832 to 1847 and served as First Lord of the Admiralty under Lord Melbourne. Rosebery's mother was Lady (Catherine Lucy) Wilhelmina Stanhope (1819\u20131901), a historian who later wrote under her second married name \"the Duchess of Cleveland\", a daughter of Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl Stanhope. Lord Dalmeny died on 23 January 1851, having predeceased his father, when the courtesy title passed to his son, the future Rosebery, as the new heir to the earldom. In 1854 his mother remarried to Lord Harry Vane (later after 1864 known as Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland). The relationship between mother and son was very poor. His elder and favourite sister Lady Leconfield was the wife of Henry Wyndham, 2nd Baron Leconfield."

At Eton, he formed a close attachment to his tutor William Johnson Cory: they visited Rome together in 1864, and maintained correspondence for years afterwards. Dalmeny proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating in January 1866. He left Oxford in 1868: Dalmeny bought a horse named Ladas, although a rule banned undergraduates from owning horses. When he was found out, he was offered a choice: to sell the horse or to give up his studies. He chose the latter, and subsequently was a prominent figure in British horseracing for 40 years. The three Prime Ministers from 1880 to 1902, namely Gladstone, Salisbury and Rosebery, all attended both Eton and Christ Church. Rosebery toured the United States in 1873, 1874 and 1876. He was pressed to marry Marie Fox, the sixteen-year-old adopted daughter of Henry Fox, 4th Baron Holland. She declined him."

However, in 1828, Rosebery's grandfather had been created 1st Baron Rosebery in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which did entitle Rosebery to sit in the Lords like all peers of the United Kingdom, and barred him from a career in the House of Commons."

        "content": "At Eton, Rosebery notably attacked Charles I of England for his despotism, and went on to praise his Whig forebears \u2013 his ancestor, James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope, was a minister to George I of Great Britain. Benjamin Disraeli often met with Rosebery in the 1870s to try to recruit him for his party, but this proved futile. Disraeli's major rival, William Ewart Gladstone, also pursued Rosebery, with considerable success. As part of the Liberal plan to get Gladstone to be MP for Midlothian, Rosebery sponsored and largely ran the Midlothian Campaign of 1879. He based this on what he had observed in elections in the United States. Gladstone spoke from open-deck trains, and gathered mass support. In 1880, he was duly elected Member for Midlothian and returned to the premiership. Rosebery served as Foreign Secretary in Gladstone's brief third ministry in 1886. He served as the first chairman of the London County Council, set up by the Conservatives in 1889. Rosebery Avenue in Clerkenwell is named after him. He served as President of the first day of the 1890 Co-operative Congress. Rosebery's second period as Foreign Secretary, 1892\u20131894, predominantly involved quarrels with France over Uganda. To quote his hero Napoleon, Rosebery thought that \"the Master of Egypt is the Master of India\"; thus he pursued the policy of expansion in Africa. Rosebery helped Gladstone's Second Home Rule Bill in the House of Lords; nevertheless it was defeated overwhelmingly in the autumn of 1893. The first bill had been defeated in the House of Commons in 1886."

        "content": "Rosebery became a leader of the Liberal Imperialist faction of the Liberal Party and when Gladstone retired, in 1894, Rosebery succeeded him as Prime Minister, much to the disgust of Sir William Harcourt, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and leader of the more left-wing Liberals. Rosebery's selection was largely because Queen Victoria disliked most of the other leading Liberals. Rosebery was in the Lords, but Harcourt controlled the Commons, where he often undercut the prime minister. Rosebery's government was largely unsuccessful, as in the Armenian crisis of 1895\u201396. He spoke out for a strongly pro-Armenian and anti-Turkish policy. Gladstone, a prime minister in retirement, called on Britain to intervene alone. The added pressure weakened Rosebery. His designs in foreign policy, such as expansion of the fleet, were defeated by disagreements within the Liberal Party. He angered all the European powers. The Unionist-dominated House of Lords stopped the whole of the Liberals' domestic legislation. The strongest figure in the cabinet was Rosebery's rival, Harcourt. He and his son Lewis were perennial critics of Rosebery's policies. There were two future prime ministers in the Cabinet, Home Secretary H. H. Asquith, and Secretary of State for War Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Rosebery rapidly lost interest in running the government. In the last year of his premiership, he was increasingly haggard: he suffered insomnia due to the continual dissension in his Cabinet. On 21 June 1895, the government lost a vote in committee on army supply by just seven votes. While this might have been treated merely as a vote of no confidence in Secretary for War Campbell-Bannerman, Rosebery chose to treat it as a vote of censure on his government. On 22 June, he and his ministers tendered their resignations to the Queen, who invited the Unionist leader, Lord Salisbury, to form a government. The following month, the Unionists won a crushing victory in the 1895 general election, and held power for ten years (1895\u20131905) under Salisbury and Arthur Balfour. Rosebery remained the Liberal leader for another year, then permanently retired from politics."

With the Liberals in opposition divided over the Boer War which started in 1899, Rosebery, although officially politically inactive, emerged as the head of the \u201cLiberal Imperialists\u201d faction of the party, opposed to Irish Home rule. He supported the war, and brought along many nonconformists likewise. However the war was opposed by a younger faction of Liberals, including David Lloyd George and the party leader Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Rosebery's acolytes, including H. H. Asquith and Edward Grey, regularly implored him to return as party leader and even Campbell-Bannerman said he would serve under Rosebery, if he accepted fundamental Liberal party doctrine. In a much trailed speech to the Chesterfield Liberal Association in December 1901, Rosebery was widely expected to announce his return but instead delivered what Harcourt's son and private secretary Lewis described as \"an insult to the whole past of the Liberal party\", by telling the party to \"clean its slate\". In 1902 Rosebery was installed as president of the newly formed \u201cLiberal League\u201d which superseded the Liberal Imperialist League and counted amongst its vice presidents Asquith and Grey."

Rosebery turned to writing, including biographies of Lord Chatham, Pitt the Younger, Napoleon, and Lord Randolph Churchill. Another one of his passionate interests was the collecting of rare books. The last years of his political life saw Rosebery become a purely negative critic of the Liberal governments of Campbell-Bannerman and Asquith. His crusade \"for freedom as against bureaucracy, for freedom as against democratic tyranny, for freedom as against class legislation, and ... for freedom as against Socialism\" was a lonely one, conducted from the crossbenches in the Lords. He joined the die-hard unionist peers in attacking Lloyd George's redistributive People's Budget in 1909 but stopped short of voting against the measure for fear of bringing retribution upon the Lords. The crisis provoked by the Lords' rejection of the budget encouraged him to reintroduce his resolutions for Lords reform, but they were lost with the dissolution of parliament in December 1910. After assaulting the \"ill-judged, revolutionary and partisan\" terms of the 1911 Parliament Bill, which proposed to curb the Lords' veto, he voted with the government in what proved to be his last appearance in the House of Lords. This was effectively the end of his public life, though he made several public appearances to support the war effort after 1914 and sponsored a \"bantam battalion\" in 1915. Though Lloyd George offered him \"a high post not involving departmental labour\" to augment his 1916 coalition, Rosebery declined to serve."

Her father had died four years previously in 1874, and bequeathed to her the bulk of his estate. Later on the same day the marriage was blessed in a Christian ceremony in Christ Church, Down Street, Piccadilly. In January 1878 Rosebery had told a friend that he found Hannah \"very simple, very unspoilt, very clever, very warm-hearted and very shy ... I never knew such a beautiful character.\"  Both Queen Victoria's son the Prince of Wales and her cousin, the army commander Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, attended the ceremony.  Hannah's death in 1890 from typhoid, compounded by Bright's disease, left him distraught. More than a decade after his wife's death, in July 1901, it was speculated that Rosebery intended to marry the widowed Princess Helena, Duchess of Albany, widow of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, 4th son of Queen Victoria. Rosebery never remarried."

        "content": "Throughout his life, it was rumoured that Rosebery was homosexual or bisexual. He was a notorious misogynist, and liked to surround himself with younger men. As a student at Eton, beyond his close relationship with his tutor, William Johnson Cory, he fell madly in love with at least one fellow student, Frederick Vyner, by whose murder at the hands of Greek brigands in 1870 he was devastated, keeping the anniversary sacred for the rest of his life. Like Oscar Wilde, he was hounded by John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry for his association with Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig, Queensberry's first born son \u2013 who had become his private secretary in 1892 when Rosebery became Foreign Secretary. A few months later he arranged for Drumlanrig, who was 26 at the time, to be made a junior member of the government with a seat in the House of Lords. During the preliminary hearing of the case against Wilde, a letter from Queensberry was produced referring to him as 'a damned cur and coward of the Rosebery type'. On 18 October 1894, sixteen months after his ennoblement, Drumlanrig died from injuries received during a shooting party. The inquest returned a verdict of \"accidental death\", but his death was rumoured potentially to be suicide or murder. It was speculated at the time that Drumlanrig may have had a romantic, if not sexual, relationship with Rosebery. The suggestion was that Queensberry had threatened to expose the Prime Minister if his government did not vigorously prosecute Wilde for Wilde's relationship with Drumlanrig's younger brother, Lord Alfred Douglas. Queensberry believed, as he put it in a letter, that \"Snob Queers like Rosebery\" had corrupted his sons, and he held Rosebery indirectly responsible for Drumlanrig's death. He claimed to have evidence of Rosebery's transgressions but that was never confirmed. Using a minor defeat in Parliament that didn't warrant such action, Rosebery resigned from the Premiership on 22 June 1895. This was a few months after the death of Drumlanrig and not quite a month after Wilde was convicted on 25 May, his life and reputation destroyed by a man who was also pursuing Rosebery for the same reason he was after Wilde. In August 1893, Queensberry had followed Rosebery to the spa town of Bad Homburg with the declared intention of giving him a horse-whipping, and had to be dissuaded by the Prince of Wales who was also staying there. In his recollections, Rosebery wrote: \"I cannot forget 1895. To lie awake night after night, wide awake, hopeless of sleep, tormented of nerves, and to realise all that was going on, at which I was present, so to speak, like a disembodied spirit, to watch one's own corpse, as it were day after day, is an experience which no sane man would repeat.\" Sir Edmund Backhouse wrote in his unpublished memoirs that he had been one of Rosebery's lovers - although it has been suggested that many of Backhouse's claims were dubiously made. Robert Rhodes James, who wrote a biography of Rosebery in 1963 (when homosexuality was still illegal in Britain), makes no mention of homosexual relationships at all, while for Leo McKinstry, who was writing in 2005, the evidence that Rosebery was homosexual is circumstantial. Michael Bloch, in 2015, has, however, no doubt that Rosebery was at least romantically interested in men, making him one of the four figures presented in the first chapter of his book on homosexual and bisexual British politicians of the 20th century. In his view, any remaining evidence (of which he gives a long list) can only be circumstantial in any case, considering Rosebery's paranoid taste for secrecy."

He served in India, where he did research on enteric fever and kala-azar. He returned to the United Kingdom and was stationed at the Victoria Hospital in Netley in 1897. In 1900 he was made Assistant Professor of Pathology in the Army Medical School, and described a method of staining blood for malaria and other parasites\u2014a modification and simplification of the existing Romanowsky method using a compound of methylene blue and eosin, which became known as Leishman's stain. In 1901, while examining pathologic specimens of a spleen from a patient who had died of kala azar (now called \"visceral leishmaniasis\"), he observed oval bodies and published his account of them in 1903.  Charles Donovan of the Indian Medical Service independently found such bodies in other kala azar patients, and they are now known as Leishman\u2013Donovan bodies (not to be confused with Donovan bodies, which are found in Granuloma inguinale, which is caused by Klebsiella granulomatis) and recognized as the protozoan that causes kala azar, Leishmania donovani. Leishman's name was engraved into the history of parasitology by Sir Ronald Ross, who was impressed by Leishman's work and classified the etiologic agent of kala azar into the separate genus Leishmania. The parasitic organisms from this genus were described earlier by Peter Borovsky in 1892. Leishman also helped elucidate the life cycle of Spirochaeta duttoni, which causes African tick fever, and, with Almroth Wright, helped develop an effective anti-typhoid inoculation. He was president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 1911\u20131912 and Director General of the Army Medical Services from 1923 to 1926. He is buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery."

        "content": "Nunn first entered politics as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives in 1968. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1972, defeating appointed U.S. Senator David H. Gambrell in the Democratic primary and U.S. Rep. Fletcher Thompson in the general election. Nunn retired from the Senate in 1997, offering a lack of \"zest and enthusiasm\" as justification. During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Nunn served as chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He also served on the Intelligence and Small Business Committees. His legislative achievements include the landmark Department of Defense Reorganization Act, drafted with the late Senator Barry Goldwater, and the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which provided assistance to Russia and the former Soviet republics for securing and destroying their excess nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program deactivated more than 7,600 nuclear warheads. He was supposedly a top choice to be Secretary of Defense or State in 1992 and 1996 and in a prospective Gore cabinet in 2000. Overall, Nunn was a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who often broke with his party on a host of social and economic issues. He opposed the budget bill of 1993, which included provisions to raise taxes in order to reduce the budget deficit. He neither supported nor opposed Hillary Clinton's attempt to establish universal health care, though he spoke out very strongly against the proposed insurance mandate. Nunn actively worked to block President Bill Clinton's proposal to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the military. In 2008, Nunn endorsed a new Pentagon study to examine the issue of homosexuals serving openly in the military: \"I think [when] 15 years go by on any personnel policy, it's appropriate to take another look at it\u2014see how it's working, ask the hard questions, hear from the military. Start with a Pentagon study.\" According to opensecrets.org, Sam Nunn received about $2.4 million during his 1989\u20131994 political career.  His main contributors were the finance/insurance/real estate sector (totaling $411,665; $46,660 was received from Goldman, Sachs & Co), the defense industry, lawyers and lobbyists, the alcohol and non-alcoholic beverages industry (including Coca-Cola), and the agriculture sector. He voted in favor of school prayer, capping punitive damage awards, amending the U.S. Constitution to require a balanced budget, and limiting death penalty appeals. On certain issues like abortion, the environment, gun control, and affirmative action, Nunn took a more liberal line. He consistently voted in favor of increased immigration. One of his most controversial votes was his vote against the Gulf War. In September 1994, Nunn, former President Jimmy Carter and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell were asked by President Bill Clinton to go to Haiti in order to force the departure of the military dictator Lieutenant General Raoul C\u00e9dras. In 1994 Clinton publicly demanded that the Haitian government step aside and restore democratic rule. Clinton deployed a large military force to surround the country in September 1994. Just before the troops reached Haiti, Clinton sent a delegation led by Carter, Nunn and Powell to urge C\u00e9dras to step down and leave the country. C\u00e9dras agreed and surrendered the government, and he and his top lieutenants left the country in October. Just days later, American forces escorted the country's elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, into the capital. Afterwards, Clinton lavished praise on Nunn's delegation for averting a military strike on the nation. \"As all of you know, at my request, President Carter, Gen. Colin Powell, and Sen. Sam Nunn went to Haiti to facilitate the dictators' departure. I have been in constant contact with them for the last two days. They have worked tirelessly, almost around the clock, and I want to thank them for undertaking this crucial mission on behalf of all Americans\", Clinton said. Upon his exit from the Senate at the end of 1996, Nunn was the recipient of bipartisan praise from his colleagues. Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia concluded, \"Senator Nunn quickly established himself as one of the leading experts in the Congress and, indeed, all of the United States on national security and foreign policy. He gained a reputation in our country and, indeed, worldwide as a global thinker, and that is where I think he will make his greatest contribution in the years to come, wherever he may be, in terms of being a global thinker. His approach to national security issues has been guided by one fundamental criteria: What Sam Nunn believes is in the best interest of the United States of America.\""

In addition to his work with the Nuclear Threat Initiative, Nunn continued his service in the public policy arena as a distinguished professor in the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at Georgia Tech. There, he hosted the biennial Sam Nunn Policy Forum, a policy meeting that brings together noted academic, government, and private-sector experts on technology, public policy, and international affairs to address issues of immediate importance to the nation. Nunn was an active Advisory Board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. He signed a number of the organization's bipartisan policy statements on important issues ranging from climate change to enhanced interrogation practices and nonproliferation. Additionally, Nunn served as Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. At CSIS Nunn and former Senator and United States Secretary of Defense William Cohen joined together for a series of public roundtable discussions designed to focus Americans on the seminal issues that the United States must face. The Cohen-Nunn Dialogues featured top thought leaders, public policy experts, prominent journalists, and leading scholars. Nunn was a retired partner in the law firm of King & Spalding. He was a board member of The Coca-Cola Company. In 2005, Nunn teamed up with former Senator Fred Thompson to promote a new film, Last Best Chance, on the dangers of excess nuclear weapons and materials. The film aired on HBO in October 2005. He gave a full presentation outlining his goals at the Commonwealth Club of California. Nunn\u2014along with William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and George Shultz\u2014called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in five Wall Street Journal op-eds proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda. Nunn reinforced that agenda during a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School on October 21, 2008, saying, \"I'm much more concerned about a terrorist without a return address that cannot be deterred than I am about deliberate war between nuclear powers. You can't deter a group who is willing to commit suicide. We are in a different era. You have to understand the world has changed.\" In 2010, the four were featured in a documentary film entitled Nuclear Tipping Point, also produced by the Nuclear Threat Initiative. The film is a visual and historical depiction of the ideas laid forth in the Wall Street Journal op-eds and reinforces their commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and the steps that can be taken to reach that goal. Nunn was a Member of the Supervisory Council of the International Luxembourg Forum on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe, a not-for-profit organization uniting leading experts on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, materials and delivery vehicles. He also served on the Board of Advisors for the National Bureau of Asian Research, a non-profit, nonpartisan research institution. In June 2013, Nunn added his voice to public support for an updated nuclear-arms limitation agreement with Russia. The 1992 Nunn-Lugar agreement had just expired at a time of increasing political tension between the two nations. Nunn applauded the determination of Presidents Obama and Putin to renew its core provisions, while urging further work to agree on chemical and biological weapons limits also. Nunn served as a member the Board of Curators for the Georgia Historical Society. He was an advisory board member of Theranos, a fraudulent biotech company."

Despite having publicly declared his lack of interest in being a candidate for vice president, Nunn continued to be mentioned by some political pundits and politicians as a potential running mate for Obama. In an interview published June 4, 2008 by The Guardian, former President Jimmy Carter said that he favored Nunn (a fellow Georgian) as Obama's possible choice for Vice President. Peggy Noonan, a columnist and former Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush speechwriter also expressed her support for Nunn.

According to the Lee Iacocca book, Talking Straight (1988), Chrysler Corporation came under scrutiny for selling new vehicles which were driven by company executives before the odometers were connected. Iacocca, Chrysler's CEO, was not concerned about the scandal at first but, within days of a meeting with Nunn in 1987 in which Nunn spoke of his own recently purchased Chrysler Fifth Avenue, Iacocca launched a detailed investigation into the claims, and extended warranties \u2014 and public apologies \u2014 to numerous current Chrysler owners. In 1989, it was reported that Nunn had had a drunk driving accident in 1964. This report emerged during the United States Secretary of Defense confirmation hearings of ex-Senator John Tower. Nunn was opposing Tower due to Tower's alleged drinking problems. Senator Nunn's membership in Augusta National Golf Club became the focus of a campaign by women seeking membership in the exclusive all-male club in 2002.

        "content": "Mrs. Norton was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She studied as a child at the University of Minnesota with William Lindsay, who later introduced her to Dame Myra Hess. Hess was so impressed with the 15-year-old Norton's playing that she arranged for Norton to study in England in 1923 with Hess's own mentor, the famed pedagogue Tobias Matthay, with whom Norton would remain in association for 8 years. Mrs. Norton made her first appearance within that same year with the Queen\u2019s Hall Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Sir Henry Wood, who subsequently took Norton on tour as soloist throughout the provinces. She played many recitals at that time in Wigmore Hall, and was soloist with the Manchester, Birmingham, and B.B.C. Symphonies under Sirs Hamilton Harty and Adrian Boult. After winning the Chappell Gold Medal and the London Bach Prize in 1927, she performed in Vienna, The Hague, Paris, and Leipzig with the famous Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. In Berlin alone, she gave more than twenty concerts to dazzling critical reviews, including a Bach concert about which musicologist and critic Alfred Einstein wrote, \"Her Bach is played as Bach would have wished to hear it.\" In Amsterdam, Paderewski said after hearing her Chopin, \"You will play in all the great halls of the world.\" As if fulfilling this prediction, Norton soon played in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Budapest. In the United States, she made her formal debut at Carnegie Hall and later premiered many new works at frequent concert appearances at Town Hall. She was invited by Koussevitzsky to play with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and was heard from coast to coast as recitalist and soloist with the New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, and Chicago symphonies under Dobrowen, Verbrugghen, Stokowski, Ormandy, Stock, Reiner, and Steinberg. One highlight from this period was her premiere performance and recording with RCA Victor of Hindemith's Kammermusik No. 2, with Stokowski conducting. An important milestone occurred in Mrs. Norton's development when she heard Artur Schnabel's performances of Beethoven's piano sonatas in 1932. She spent three successive seasons under his tutelage in Berlin and Italy, and later enjoyed many rewarding years of friendship and association with him. Yet, possibly the most important factor in Mrs. Norton's evolution as an artist occurred during the years which she spent away from the concert stage developing her playing through more secluded work. In 1934, Mrs. Norton married chemist Bernard Lewis and settled in Pittsburgh in 1942 to raise a family when he was hired by the U.S. Bureau of Mines. She continued to perform, soloing with the PSO under music director William Steinberg in 1954 and giving numerous local recitals. With her husband she founded Pittsburgh\u2019s chapter of the New Friends of Music, which still exists today as the Pittsburgh Chamber Music Society, the city\u2019s premiere chamber music series. She was an honorary member of the Tuesday Music Club. She later founded the Peacham Music Festival in Vermont, where many live recordings of her maturing performances were produced. Mrs. Norton performed with the American Chamber Orchestra, the Juilliard, Budapest, Griller, and Curtis String Quartets, at the White House for President Hoover, a Schnabel memorial concert at Lincoln Center, an all Beethoven recital at Rockefeller University, and the first radio broadcast of Bach's Goldberg Variations in the USA. She is well known for her master classes at her studios in Pennsylvania, Vermont, and at numerous universities throughout the United States, and has taught at the University of Pittsburgh, the Catholic University of America, the University of Minnesota, and was Visiting Professor of Piano at Carnegie-Mellon University. Her series of four lectures on the teaching of Artur Schnabel was documented at the University of Pittsburgh in 1987, and her lecture on Matthay\u2019s teaching was filmed in November 1995 at Carnegie-Mellon University. She died in Vienna, Austria at 97."

        "content": "DeVore grew up in Joy, Texas, and attended the University of Texas for his undergraduate studies. He later pursued his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago upon receiving the Danford Scholarship, which paid the full costs for his and his wife's, Nancy DeVore, graduate education. DeVore went on to do field research on the behavior and ecology of baboons in 1959, at the same time Jane Goodall was doing her research on chimpanzees and Robert Ardrey was writing African Genesis (1961), a book that DeVore used to use as an example of how not to explain human evolution scientifically. DeVore's own mentor was Sherwood Washburn, a distinguished physical anthropologist and primatologist whom DeVore followed from the University of Chicago, where he received his Ph.D. in 1962, to the University of California at Berkeley, where he held a prestigious Miller Fellowship. Under Washburn's wing, he carried out pioneering studies of baboon behavior and ecology, and in 1965 published a collection of research chapters on various primates, a volume under DeVore's editorship that helped define the field of behavioral primatology. His many field trips to the baboons were a natural focus for a young man who, growing up in and around Joy, Texas, had steeped himself in nature. Throughout life he was known for delightedly adopting odd pets, and his trips to Africa put him back in touch with the natural world he had loved since childhood."

        "content": "However, by the mid-'60s he had turned his attention to humans, through his collaboration with Richard B. Lee. Together they organized (despite their youth) an influential international conference called Man the Hunter, which included Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss in cultural anthropology, Lewis Binford in archeology, and other experts in disciplines relevant to hunter-gatherer studies, a sub-field Lee and DeVore helped create. The conference led to a landmark book in 1968; although the title seemed anachronistic within a few years, the book posited that women were the main breadwinners in that type of society. Meanwhile, Lee and DeVore had also made their first, exploratory visit to northwestern Botswana, where they contacted San (or \"Bushman\") people who were still hunting and gathering for a living. Together they mounted a years-long, multidisciplinary project to study the way of life of the group known as the !Kung or Ju/'hoansi, involving a number of graduate students and visiting scientists. The study became a model for multidisciplinary anthropological field work, which DeVore often contrasted with the classic approach of \"one ethnographer with his people against the sky.\" He did not shrink from making barbed statements and he cast a narrow critical shadow, but for those whose work he liked, his support was legendary. DeVore's kind of field research was more expensive, but he was vigorous and successful in raising grant funds for research that he believed in, by himself and others. In the late 1970s he began another major multidisciplinary study, together with Robert Bailey and Nadine Peacock, among the small-stature hunter-gatherers of the Ituri rain forest. This too produced a stream of monographs and scientific papers that contributed to our understand of this way of life, which DeVore believed shed light on the human past. This claim became widely accepted. DeVore was sometimes accused of treating the San and Ituri people as relics of that past, but he always explained that they were people like us who happened to still be subsisting in this very old way."

        "content": "DeVore, not one to shy away from controversy, was also an early enthusiast of the fields of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, fostering their development through mentoring and teaching as well as through interviews, lectures, debates, and writing for scientific and popular audiences. He became an advocate for the evolutionary biological approach after being one of the few to listen to the ideas of Robert Trivers, who was shunned due to his mental illness. Several years into this new way of looking at animal and human behavior, DeVore was asked whether the data were really supporting it. He liked to say, \"The data are sitting up and begging.\" By the turn of the millennium sociobiology and evolutionary psychology had become normal science, although still controversial. One of the painful consequences for DeVore in the '80s and '90s was that his mentor and close friend, \"Sherry\" Washburn, was a bitter opponent of the new approach. They eventually reconciled, but never agreed. DeVore had a sometimes caustic but compelling personality and intellect that worked their influence in and out of the classroom. He appeared on many television programs as an expert or narrator. He played an instrumental role in developing supplementary school curricula, one of which, \"Man: A Course of Study\" (MACOS) became a subject of Congressional debate because of its emphasis on evolution. The son of an itinerant Methodist preacher in East Texas, DeVore had sold Bibles door-to-door for a time as a very young man, but when he became convinced of the validity of Darwin's theory, he taught and defended it with what many said was a compelling art of persuasion. He suggested that, due to sexual selection, \"Males are basically a breeding experiment run by females\" and that \"Males are the safest, most consistent way to contribute variation to the system...\" Irven DeVore once said that \"There is no excuse for boring students when you're talking about human nature. It's too interesting.\" He taught in large lecture halls that were perennially full as well as in the smaller but influential \"Simian Seminar,\" which met in his living room on Wednesday evenings, in his rambling, comfortable home on a quiet wooded street in Cambridge. Leading or rising figures in the fields he was interested in came to address the seminar, which was a center of intellectual ferment in those fields for decades. Through these seminars, the ideas of evolutionary biology rose to prominence as group selection (with regard to explaining behaviour) faded, albeit not directly through Irven's work. Leda Cosmides and John Tooby, two attendees of the seminars, stated \"DeVore's intellectual impact is less well known because his ideas were realized through his students and colleagues.\""

        "content": "Joseph Kabila Kabange ( , ; born 4 June 1971) is a Congolese politician who served as President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo between January 2001 and January 2019. He took office ten days after the assassination of his father, President Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila in the context of the Second Congo War. He was allowed to remain in power after the 2003 Pretoria Accord ended the war as the president of the country's new transitional government. He was elected as president in 2006 and re-elected in 2011 for a second term. Since stepping down after the 2018 election, Kabila, as a former president, serves as a senator for life. Kabila's term was due to expire on 20 December 2016, according to the terms of the constitution adopted in 2006. Officials suggested that elections would be held in November 2016, but on 29 September 2016, the nation's electoral authority announced that the election would not be held until early 2018. Talk focused on the need for a census before holding elections. In August 2018, Kabila announced that he would step down and not seek reelection in the December 2018 general election. He was succeeded by F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi in the country's first peaceful transition of power since independence. While in power, Joseph Kabila faced continuous wars in eastern Congo and internal rebel forces supported by the neighboring governments of Uganda and Rwanda."

According to official accounts, the twins were born at Hewabora, a small village in the Fizi territory of the South Kivu province, in eastern Congo. Rumors have abounded that Kabila was actually born in Tanzania, which would make him a citizen of that country. He is the son of long time rebel, former AFDL leader and president of the Congo Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila and Sifa Mahanya. Kabila's childhood coincided with the low point of his father's political and military career. He was raised in relative remoteness, with few records of his early days. Kabila attended a primary school organized by his father's rebel forces, before moving to Tanzania where he completed primary and secondary school. Due to his father's status as an enemy of Zairean strongman Mobutu Sese Seko, Kabila posed as a Tanzanian in his school years to avoid detection by Zairean intelligence agents."

In October 1996, Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila launched the campaign in Zaire to oust the Mobutu regime with his newly formed army, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL). Joseph Kabila became the commander of an AFDL unit that included \"kadogos\" (child soldiers) and likely played a key role in major battles on the road to Kinshasa, but his exact whereabouts during the war have been difficult to establish. Joseph Kabila appears to have been present at the liberation of Kisangani where media reports identified him as commander of the rebel force that took the city after four days of intense fighting. Following the AFDL's victory, and Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila's rise to the presidency, Joseph Kabila went on to get further training at the PLA National Defense University, in Beijing, China. When he returned from China, Kabila was awarded the rank of major-general, and appointed Deputy Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 1998. He was later, in 2000, appointed Chief of Staff of the Land Forces, a position he held until the elder President Kabila's assassination in January 2001. As chief of staff, he was one of the main military leaders in charge of government troops during the time of the Second Congo War (1998\u20132003)."

        "content": "Kabila rose to the presidency on 26 January 2001 after the assassination of Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, becoming the world's first head of government born in the 1970s. Aged 29, he was considered young and inexperienced. He subsequently attempted to end the ongoing civil war by negotiating peace agreements with rebel groups backed by Rwanda and Uganda, the same regional armies who had brought Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila's rebel group to power three years before. The 2002 peace agreement signed at the Inter-Congolese Dialogue in Sun City, South Africa, which nominally ended the Second Congo War, maintained Joseph Kabila as President and head of state of the Congo. An interim administration was set up under him, including the leaders of the country's two main rebel groups as vice-presidents (two other vice-presidents were representatives of the civilian opposition and government supporters respectively). On 28 March 2004, an apparent coup attempt or mutiny around the capital Kinshasa, allegedly by members of the former guard of former president Mobutu Sese Seko (who had been ousted by Kabila's father in 1997 and died in the same year), failed. On 11 June 2004, coup plotters led by Major Eric Lenge allegedly attempted to take power and announced on state radio that the transitional government was suspended, but were defeated by loyalist troops. In December 2005, a partial referendum  approved a new constitution, and a presidential election was held on 30 July 2006, having been delayed from an earlier date in June. The new constitution lowered the minimum age of presidential candidates from 35 to 30; Kabila turned 35 shortly before the election. In March 2006, he registered as a candidate. Although Kabila registered as an independent, he is the \"initiator\" of the People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD), which chose him as their candidate in the election. Although the new constitution stipulates that a debate be held between the two remaining candidates for the presidency, no debates took place and many declared this unconstitutional. According to widely disputed provisional results announced on 20 August, Kabila won 45% of the vote; his main opponent, vice-president and former rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba, won 20%. The irregularities surrounding the elections results prompted a run-off vote between Kabila and Bemba which was held on 29 October. On 15 November, the electoral commission announced the official results and Kabila was declared the winner, with 58.05% of the vote. These results were confirmed by the Supreme Court on 27 November 2006, and Kabila was inaugurated on 6 December 2006 as the country's newly elected president. He named Antoine Gizenga, who placed third in the first round of the presidential election (and then backed Kabila in the second round) as prime minister on 30 December. In 2006, Kabila responded to evidence of widespread sex crimes committed by the Congolese military by describing the acts as \"simply unforgivable\". He pointed out that 300 soldiers had been convicted of sex crimes, although he added that this was not enough."

        "content": "In December 2011, Kabila was re-elected for a second term as president. After the results were announced on 9 December, there was violent unrest in Kinshasa and Mbuji-Mayi, where official tallies showed that a strong majority had voted for the opposition candidate Etienne Tshisekedi. Official observers from the Carter Center reported that returns from almost 2,000 polling stations in areas where support for Tshisekedi was strong had been lost and not included in the official results. They described the election as lacking credibility. On 20 December, Kabila was sworn in for a second term, promising to invest in infrastructure and public services. However, Tshisekedi maintained that the result of the election was illegitimate and said that he intended also to \"swear himself in\" as president. In January 2012, Catholic bishops in DR Congo also condemned the elections, complaining of \"treachery, lies and terror\", and calling on the election commission to correct \"serious errors\". On 17 January 2015, Congo's parliament passed an electoral law requiring a census before the next elections. On 19 January protests led by students at the University of Kinshasa broke out. The protests began following the announcement of a proposed law that would allow Kabila to remain in power until a national census could be conducted (elections had been planned for 2016). By Wednesday 21 January clashes between police and protesters had claimed at least 42 lives, although the government claimed only 15 people had been killed. The Senate responded to protests by striking the census requirement from its law. Mo\u00efse Katumbi announced in October 2015 that he would leave the ruling party due to disagreements over the scheduled election. Jaynet Kabila, the sister of Kabila, was named in the Panama Papers. Document leaks in 2016 revealed that she is a part-owner of a major Congolese television company, , through offshore subsidiaries. Kabila is vastly unpopular, partly because of the conflicts in the Congo, but also because of the widespread belief that he has enriched himself and his family while ignoring millions of poor Congolese. There have been protests against his attempts to change term limits and extend his rule. Harsh demonstrations erupted on 20 April 2016 in Lubumbashi, one of Congo's biggest cities. When Moise Katumbi, the former governor of Katanga Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo and now an opposition figure, announced that he was running for president in an election that was supposed to be held by the end of 2016, his house was surrounded by security forces wanting to arrest him. Although Kabila's forces have scored an important victory against one large rebel group, the M23, in 2013, many other armed groups have splintered into dangerous movements. And by 2016 new ones had risen, like militias in the Nyunzu area that have killed hundreds of people."

On 19 September 2016, massive protests rocked Kinshasa calling for him to step down as legally mandated. Seventeen people were killed. Elections to determine a successor to Kabila were originally scheduled to be held on 27 November 2016. On 29 September 2016, the nation's electoral authority announced that the election would not be held until early 2018. According to the electoral commission's vice president, the commission \"hasn't called elections in 2016 because the number of voters isn't known.\" However, the opposition alleges that Kabila had intentionally delayed the election to remain in power. Partially in response to the delayed election, the United States issued sanctions against two members of Kabila's inner circle, John Numbi and Gabriel Amisi Kumba, on 28 September. These actions were seen as a warning to President Kabila to respect his country's constitution. More demonstrations were planned to mark the passing of the end of the presidential mandate. Opposition groups claim that the outcome of late elections would be civil war. Maman Sidikou, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for DR Congo and head of MONUSCO, said that a tipping point into uncontrollable violence could come about very quickly if the political situation is not normalised. Kabila's second term as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo was due to end on 20 December 2016. A statement issued by his spokesperson on 19 December 2016, stated that Joseph Kabila would remain in post until a new president is in place following elections which will not be held until at least April 2018. Kabila subsequently installed a new cabinet led by prime minister Samy Badibanga, resulting in protests in which at least 40 people were killed. Under articles 75 and 76 of the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Congo, should the office of the president become vacant, the Chairman of the Senate, presently L\u00e9on Kengo would assume the presidency in an acting capacity. On 23 December, an agreement was proposed between the main opposition group and the Kabila government under which the latter agreed not to alter the constitution and to leave office before the end of 2017.  Under the agreement opposition leader \u00c9tienne Tshisekedi will oversee that the deal is implemented and the country's Prime Minister will be appointed by the opposition. In late February 2018 the ministry of international affairs of Botswana told Kabila that it was time to go and said the \"worsening humanitarian situation\" in DRC is compounded by the fact that \"its leader has persistently delayed holding elections, and has lost control over the security of his country\". On December 30, 2018 the presidential election to determine the successor to Kabila was held. Kabila endorsed Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, his former interior minister. On January 10, 2019, the electoral commission announced opposition candidate F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi as the winner of the vote."

The U.S. Championship was organized in a round-robin format during that era. When in 1936 Frank Marshall voluntarily gave up the American Championship title he had held since 1909, the result was the first modern U.S. Championship tournament. Fine scored 10\u00bd/15 in the U.S. Championship, New York City 1936, and tied third\u2013fourth, as Reshevsky won. In the U.S. Championship, New York 1938, Fine placed second with 12\u00bd/16, with Reshevsky repeating as champion. In the U.S. Championship, New York 1940, Fine again scored 12\u00bd/16 for second place, as Reshevsky won for the third straight time. Then in the 1944 U.S. Championship at New York, Fine scored 14\u00bd/17 for second, losing his game to Arnold Denker, and finishing half a point back, as the latter won his only national title. Fine tallied 50/64 in his four U.S. title attempts, for 78.1%, but was never champion. Not being national champion seriously hurt Fine's prospects for making a career from chess."

Fine shared 1st\u20133rd at Ostend 1937 with Keres and Henry Grob on 6/9. At Stockholm 1937, Fine won with 8/9, 1\u00bd points ahead of Gideon St\u00e5hlberg.

It was organized with the hope that the winner of AVRO, a double round-robin tournament, would be the next challenger to world champion Alexander Alekhine. Since Alekhine won the title in 1927, he had been avoiding a rematch with his predecessor, Capablanca, whom many considered the strongest possible challenger. Fine finished ahead of future champion Mikhail Botvinnik, current champion Alekhine, former world champions Max Euwe and Capablanca, and Samuel Reshevsky and Salo Flohr. Fine won both of his games against Alekhine. Fine got out to a tremendous start, scoring five wins and a draw in his first six games, but then lost in round seven to Keres, and this wound up as the decisive game for the tournament victor, providing his tiebreak."

In 1939, Fine became the first world-class player to edit the classic opening guide Modern Chess Openings. His work on the sixth edition of the book led to a significant increase in sales. In 1941 he wrote Basic Chess Endings, a compendium of endgame analysis which, some 70 years later, is still considered one of the best works on this subject. His book was the most comprehensive on the subject written to that time, included significant original work by Fine, and received worldwide acclaim. His The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings, though now out of date, is still useful for grasping the underlying ideas of many standard chess openings; it was revised in 1989. Fine played a few serious American events during World War II, with international chess at a virtual standstill, and continued his successes with dominant scores. He won the U.S. Open at New York 1939 with 10\u00bd/11, half a point ahead of Reshevsky. In the 23rd Marshall Club Championship of 1939, Fine won with 14/16. He won the 1940 U.S. Open at Dallas with a perfect 8/8 in the finals, three points ahead of Herman Steiner. Fine won the New York State Championship, Hamilton 1941, with 8/10, a point ahead of Reshevsky, Arnold Denker and Isaac Kashdan. Fine won the 1941 Marshall Club Championship with 14/15, ahead of Frank Marshall. Fine won the 1941 U.S. Open at St. Louis, with 4/5 in the preliminaries, and 8/9 in the finals. Fine won the 1942 Washington, D.C. Chess Divan title with 7/7. He defeated Herman Steiner in match play for the second time by 3\u00bd\u2013\u00bd at Washington 1944. Fine won the U.S. Speed Championships of both 1944 (10/11) and 1945 (10/11). In the Pan-American Championship, Hollywood 1945, Fine placed 2nd with 9/12, behind Reshevsky.

        "content": "As the World War ended in early September 1945, Fine was 30 years of age, and working on his doctorate in psychology. After World Champion Alekhine died in March 1946, FIDE (the World Chess Federation) organized a World Chess Championship tournament to determine the new champion. Alekhine was the first champion to die as title-holder, creating an unprecedented problem. As co-winner in the AVRO tournament, Fine was invited to participate, but he declined, for reasons that are the subject of speculation even today. Fine had played a third match against Herman Steiner at Los Angeles 1947, winning 5\u20131; this match was training for his potential world championship appearance. Publicly, Fine stated that he could not interrupt work on his doctoral dissertation in psychology. Negotiations over the tournament had been protracted, and for a long time it was unclear whether this World Championship event would in fact take place. Fine wrote that he didn't want to spend many months preparing and then see the tournament cancelled. However, it has also been suggested that Fine declined to play because he suspected there would be collaboration among the three Soviet participants to ensure that one of them won the championship. In the August 2004 issue of Chess Life, for example, Larry Evans gave his recollection that \"Fine told me he didn't want to waste three months of his life watching Russians throw games to each other.\" Fine's 1951 written statement on the matter in his book The World's Greatest Chess Games was: Unfortunately for the Western masters the Soviet political organization was stronger than that of the West. The U.S. Chess Federation was a meaningless paper organization, generally antagonistic to the needs of its masters. The Dutch Chess Federation did not choose to act. The FIDE was impotent. The result was a rescheduling of the tournament for the following year, with the vital difference that now half was to be played in Holland, half in the U.S.S.R. Dissatisfied with this arrangement and the general tenor of the event, I withdrew. Edward Winter discusses the evidence further in a 2007 ChessBase column."

During World War II, Fine worked for the U.S. Navy, analyzing the probability of German U-boats surfacing at certain points in the Atlantic Ocean. Fine also worked as a translator. After World War II, he earned his doctorate in psychology from the University of Southern California. After receiving his doctorate he abandoned professional chess to concentrate on a new profession as a professor. Fine continued playing chess casually throughout his life (including several friendly games played in 1963 against Bobby Fischer, one of which is included in Fischer's My 60 Memorable Games). In 1956 he wrote an article, \"Psychoanalytic Observations on Chess and Chess Masters\", for a psychological journal. Later, Fine turned the article into a book, The Psychology of the Chess Player, in which he provided insights steeped in Freudian theory. Fine is not the first person to have examined the mind as it relates to chess: Alfred Binet, the inventor of the IQ test, had studied the mental functionality of good chess players, and found that they often had enhanced mental traits, such as a good memory. He went on to publish A History of Psychoanalysis (1979) and a number of other books on psychology. Journalist Gilbert Cant observed: A great chess player, Manhattan's Reuben Fine, has popularized a psychology of chess studded with phallic symbols, spattered with anal-sadistic impulses and imbued with latent homosexuality. In successive rounds, Fine once defeated Botvinnik, Reshevsky, Euwe, Flohr and Alekhine, and drew with Capablanca. When Fine switched his major interest from chess to psychoanalysis, the result was a loss for chess\u2014and a draw, at best, for psychoanalysis. Many psychologists, some Freudians included, now believe that the sexual symbolism in chess is vastly overdrawn. Fine served as a visiting professor at CCNY, the University of Amsterdam, the Lowell Institute of Technology, and the University of Florence. Fine founded the Creative Living Center in New York City."

From February 1960 until November 2002, he held the courtesy title Lord Mauchline. Loudoun was born in England and educated at Ampleforth College in Yorkshire, but emigrated to Jerilderie, New South Wales, as a teen, where he was a rice farmer and family man. He was the heir-general of George Plantagenet, the younger brother of Edward IV of England. If Edward IV had been illegitimate and the crown of England had descended by male-preference primogeniture before 1500, then George (and his heirs) would have been monarchs of England.

He was the founder of his namesake Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute. Raised in Bannu, Ghulam Ishaq graduated from Peshawar University and entered the Indian Civil Service, opting for Pakistan after the independence in 1947. Appointed the first chairman of the Water and Power Development Authority by President Ayub Khan in 1961, Ghulam Ishaq also served as Finance Secretary from 1966 to 1970. A year later, he was appointed Governor of the State Bank by President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, before being made Defence Secretary in 1975, assisting with Pakistan's atomic bomb programme. He was retained by President Zia-ul-Haq as Finance Minister in 1977, overseeing the country's highest GDP growth average. Elected Chairman of the Senate in 1985, Ghulam Ishaq was elevated to the presidency after Zia's death in an air crash on 17 August 1988. He was elected president on 13 December, as the consensus candidate of the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad and Pakistan People's Party. The oldest person to serve as president, Ghulam Ishaq played a hawkish role against Communist Afghanistan, while relations with the United States deteriorated following the Pressler amendment. Domestically, Ghulam Ishaq's term faced challenges: ethnic riots flared in Karachi, and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto accused him of frustrating her government as part of an alliance with conservative opposition leader Nawaz Sharif and the post-Zia military establishment. Ghulam Ishaq invoked the Eighth Amendment and dismissed Benazir's government after just 20 months, on charges of rampant corruption and misgovernance. Sharif was elected Prime Minister in 1990, but Ghulam Ishaq dismissed his government on similar charges three years later. The Supreme Court overturned the dismissal, but the gridlock ultimately led to both men resigning in 1993. Retiring from public service, Ghulam Ishaq served as rector of the GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology in his native province, dying from pneumonia in 2006. He is viewed contentiously by Pakistani historians; he is credited for personal austerity, but criticized for wielding an autocratic presidency that ousted two governments."

It was a fortuitous move in that it brought him into close contact with the Pakistani military establishment and enabled him to closely manage the nuclear weapons program. Though an unusual assignment for a financial expert, this appointment made him a powerful bureaucrat in the country. During that time, Khan became closer to General Zia-ul-Haq and had later coveted for General Zia-ul-Haq's appointment as the chief of army staff. As Defence Secretary, he helped manage Pakistan's atomic bomb project and had been directly associated with the program. Khan was a vehement support of the program and saw it as a \"national priory\". He backed the advocacy of theorist Abdul Qadeer Khan and helped establishing the Engineering Research Laboratories in Kahuta. He headed the Uranium Coordination Board (UCB) which consisted of AGN Kazi, Munir Ahmad and Agha Shahi.  Khan recommended S A Nawab for the Hilal-i-Imtiaz medal in recognition of Nawab's work in establishing Khan Research Laboratories. Later, in the 1980s Khan helped consolidate the efforts at ERL under Lt. Gen. Zahid Ali Akbar as its first military director. He approved the survey by field officer, Brigadier Akbar in 1976.  Khan also helped secure the funds for the ERL and lobbying for General Akbar's promotion as the Engineer-in-Chief in 1980. Khan cemented close relations with Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan and Munir Ahmad Khan, and remained Qadeer Khan's staunch loyal. His involvement and support earned him the nickname as \"Mr Nuke\" by the U.S. diplomats, while the new media dubbed him as \"Baba Atom Bomb \". On the contrary, Ishaq Khan did not have the directorial role in the atomic bomb program until Munir Ahmad Khan retired. However, he maintained complete logistic and operational control over ERL project from the time of its inception using Major General S A Nawab who reported to Ghulam Ishaq at the Ministry of Defence. After Munir Ahmad Khan took retirement from Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), President Ghulam Ishaq Khan eventually consolidated the entire program under the civic-military control, and supervised the classified projects of the program."

After meeting with the military leadership at the JS HQ, Khan reportedly marked that: \"this action was going to harm the country, but since it could not be reversed, they should do their best to salvage whatever they could.\" He was immediately elevated as Finance Minister by General Zia-ul-Haq, who acted as the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA). A team of economic experts and technocrats were assembled in the management of Khan, giving him the authority over the Planning Commission, Economic Coordination Committee, and Executive Committee of the Space Research Council. Khan worked towards controlling the national economy while harnessing the damaged Private sector. In 1977, Khan endorsed General Haq's bid for becoming the President of Pakistan, who tightened the grip of martial law in the country. In the 1980s, Khan backed the implementation of the economic Islamization by introducing the risk-free interest rate system as well as establishing the corporatization in the industrial sector. Khan managed the revenue collection and provided the modern shape in the state\u2013owned enterprises (SOEs) that were established in a nationalization in the 1970s. His policies and economic expertise ultimately resulted in the improvement in GDP and GNP progress, helping Pakistan's economy become among the fastest-growing in South Asia. He maintained his ties with the nuclear society and gave strong priority for the nuclear deterrence as channeling financial funds for the development of the atomic bomb projects. Khan gave tax free status to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).

Khan consolidated his position in controlling the nuclear deterrence program, keeping all the control over its direction. Problems arose when Prime Minister Bhutto made contact with Munir Ahmad and Abdul Qadeer Khan over the program's direction, which frustrated Khan.

The political deadlock persisted and after the joint intervention of the judiciary and the military, both Khan and Sharif were forced to resign."

His great uncle was Nobel prize laureate Frits Zernike, and his grandmother was married to Pieter Nicolaas van Kampen, a professor of zoology at Leiden University. His uncle Nico van Kampen was an (emeritus) professor of theoretical physics at Utrecht University, and his mother married a maritime engineer. Following his family's footsteps, he showed interest in science at an early age. When his primary school teacher asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up, he replied, \"a man who knows everything.\" After primary school Gerard attended the Dalton Lyceum, a school that applied the ideas of the Dalton Plan, an educational method that suited him well. He excelled at science and mathematics courses. At the age of sixteen he won a silver medal in the second Dutch Math Olympiad."

        "content": "After Gerard 't Hooft passed his high school exams in 1964, he enrolled in the physics program at Utrecht University. He opted for Utrecht instead of the much closer Leiden, because his uncle was a professor there and he wanted to attend his lectures. Because he was so focused on science, his father insisted that he join the Utrechtsch Studenten Corps, a student association, in the hope that he would do something else besides studying. This worked to some extent, during his studies he was a coxswain with their rowing club \"Triton\" and organized a national congress for science students with their science discussion club \"Christiaan Huygens\". In the course of his studies he decided he wanted to go into what he perceived as the heart of theoretical physics, elementary particles. His uncle had grown to dislike the subject and in particular its practitioners, so when it became time to write his doctoraalscriptie (former name of the Dutch equivalent of a master's thesis) in 1968, 't Hooft turned to the newly appointed professor Martinus Veltman, who specialized in Yang\u2013Mills theory, a relatively fringe subject at the time because it was thought that these could not be renormalized. His assignment was to study the Adler\u2013Bell\u2013Jackiw anomaly, a mismatch in the theory of the decay of neutral pions; formal arguments forbid the decay into photons, whereas practical calculations and experiments showed that this was the primary form of decay. The resolution of the problem was completely unknown at the time, and 't Hooft was unable to provide one. In 1969, 't Hooft started on his doctoral research with Martinus Veltman as his advisor. He would work on the same subject Veltman was working on, the renormalization of Yang\u2013Mills theories. In 1971 his first paper was published. In it he showed how to renormalize massless Yang\u2013Mills fields, and was able to derive relations between amplitudes, which would be generalized by Andrei Slavnov and John C. Taylor, and become known as the Slavnov\u2013Taylor identities. The world took little notice, but Veltman was excited because he saw that the problem he had been working on was solved. A period of intense collaboration followed in which they developed the technique of dimensional regularization. Soon 't Hooft's second paper was ready to be published, in which he showed that Yang\u2013Mills theories with massive fields due to spontaneous symmetry breaking could be renormalized. This paper earned them worldwide recognition, and would ultimately earn the pair the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics. These two papers formed the basis of 't Hooft's dissertation, The Renormalization procedure for Yang\u2013Mills Fields, and he obtained his PhD degree in 1972. In the same year he married his wife, Albertha A. Schik, a student of medicine in Utrecht."

        "content": "After obtaining his doctorate 't Hooft went to CERN in Geneva, where he had a fellowship. He further refined his methods for Yang\u2013Mills theories with Veltman (who went back to Geneva). In this time he became interested in the possibility that the strong interaction could be described as a massless Yang\u2013Mills theory, i.e. one of a type that he had just proved to be renormalizable and hence be susceptible to detailed calculation and comparison with experiment. According to 't Hooft's calculations, this type of theory possessed just the right kind of scaling properties (asymptotic freedom) that this theory should have according to deep inelastic scattering experiments. This was contrary to popular perception of Yang\u2013Mills theories at the time, that like gravitation and electrodynamics, their intensity should decrease with increasing distance between the interacting particles; such conventional behaviour with distance was unable to explain the results of deep inelastic scattering, whereas 't Hooft's calculations could. When 't Hooft mentioned his results at a small conference at Marseilles in 1972, Kurt Symanzik urged him to publish this result; but 't Hooft did not, and the result was eventually rediscovered and published by Hugh David Politzer, David Gross, and Frank Wilczek in 1973, which led to their earning the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1974, 't Hooft returned to Utrecht where he became assistant professor. In 1976, he was invited for a guest position at Stanford and a position at Harvard as Morris Loeb lecturer. His eldest daughter, Saskia Anne, was born in Boston, while his second daughter, Ellen Marga, was born in 1978 after he returned to Utrecht, where he was made full professor. In the academic year 1987-1988 't Hooft spent a sabbatical in the Boston University Physics Department along with Howard Georgi, Robert Jaffe and others arranged by the then new Department chair Lawrence Sulak. In 2007 't Hooft became editor-in-chief for Foundations of Physics, where he sought to distance the journal from the controversy of ECE theory. 't Hooft held the position until 2016. On July 1, 2011 he was appointed Distinguished professor by Utrecht University."

        "content": "'t Hooft is most famous for his contributions to the development of gauge theories in particle physics. The best known of these is the proof in his PhD thesis that Yang\u2013Mills theories are renormalizable, for which he shared the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics. For this proof he introduced (with his adviser Veltman) the technique of dimensional regularization. After his PhD, he became interested in the role of gauge theories in the strong interaction, the leading theory of which is called quantum chromodynamics or QCD. Much of his research focused on the problem of color confinement in QCD, i.e. the observational fact that only color neutral particles are observed at low energies. This led him to the discovery that SU(N) gauge theories simplify in the large N limit, a fact which has proved important in the examination of the conjectured correspondence between string theories in an Anti-de Sitter space and conformal field theories in one lower dimension. By solving the theory in one space and one time dimension, 't Hooft was able to derive a formula for the masses of mesons. He also studied the role of so-called instanton contributions in QCD. His calculation showed that these contributions lead to an interaction between light quarks at low energies not present in the normal theory. Studying instanton solutions of Yang\u2013Mills theories, 't Hooft discovered that spontaneously breaking a theory with SU(N) symmetry to a U(1) symmetry will lead to the existence of magnetic monopoles. These monopoles are called 't Hooft\u2013Polyakov monopoles, after Alexander Polyakov, who independently obtained the same result. As another piece in the color confinement puzzle 't Hooft introduced 't Hooft operators, which are the magnetic dual of Wilson loops. Using these operators he was able to classify different phases of QCD, which form the basis of the QCD phase diagram. In 1986, he was finally able to show that instanton contributions solve the Adler\u2013Bell\u2013Jackiw anomaly, the topic of his master's thesis."

        "content": "When Veltman and 't Hooft moved to CERN after 't Hooft obtained his PhD, Veltman's attention was drawn to the possibility of using their dimensional regularization techniques to the problem of quantizing gravity. Although it was known that perturbative quantum gravity was not completely renormalizible, they felt important lessons were to be learned by studying the formal renormalization of the theory order by order. This work would be continued by Stanley Deser and another PhD student of Veltman, Peter van Nieuwenhuizen, who later found patterns in the renormalization counter terms, which led to the discovery of supergravity. In the 1980s, 't Hooft's attention was drawn to the subject of gravity in 3 spacetime dimensions. Together with Deser and Jackiw he published an article in 1984 describing the dynamics of flat space where the only local degrees of freedom were propagating point defects. His attention returned to this model at various points in time, showing that Gott pairs would not cause causality violating timelike loops, and showing how the model could be quantized. More recently he proposed generalizing this piecewise flat model of gravity to 4 spacetime dimensions. With Stephen Hawking's discovery of Hawking radiation of black holes, it appeared that the evaporation of these objects violated a fundamental property of quantum mechanics, unitarity. 't Hooft refused to accept this problem, known as the black hole information paradox, and assumed that this must be the result of the semi-classical treatment of Hawking, and that it should not appear in a full theory of quantum gravity. He proposed that it might be possible to study some of the properties of such a theory, by assuming that such a theory was unitary. Using this approach he has argued that near a black hole, quantum fields could be described by a theory in a lower dimension. This led to the introduction of the holographic principle by him and Leonard Susskind."

Shortly thereafter, Merritt joined with former FBI Agent Frank Perry to form the Foundation for Ethics in Public Service. Perry had also served as the lead investigator at the Auditor's Office. Merritt was executive director of the foundation from 2009 through 2011. In 2013 he was appointed to the state Ethics Commission, but had to resign after almost ten months in office over a perceived conflict regarding his status as a state contractor. In February 2012, Merritt joined the board of directors of the NC Alliance for Public Charter Schools. Merritt was born and raised in rural Sampson County.  He and his wife now live in the eastern Wake County town of Zebulon.  After earning degrees in economics and accounting from North Carolina State University and becoming a Certified Public Accountant, Merritt served as the president of the Zebulon Lions and Rotary clubs, and of the Zebulon Elementary School PTA. Merritt was elected to the Wake County Board of Commissioners in 1994, a post he held until 1998. Professionally, he served as president of Merritt, Petway, Mills & Hockaday, an accounting & auditing firm with offices in Zebulon and Raleigh, prior to being elected State Auditor. In 2000, he challenged incumbent Democratic State Auditor Ralph Campbell and was narrowly defeated. In a 2004 rematch against Campbell, Merritt narrowly defeated the three-term incumbent, campaigning on a platform of fiscal conservatism. During his campaign, Merritt touted his record on the Wake County Board of Commissioners.

Easley has defended the use of taxpayer dollars for the trips. Mary Easley took two trips out of the country, one to France and one to Russia and Estonia, for \"cultural exchanges\" at a cost of $109,000, including $27,000 for rental of a French Mercedes and almost $9,000 in hotel and Monet tour costs, months after the North Carolina Museum of Art's Monet exhibit had ended. A separate trip to Italy in April 2008 taken jointly by the Easleys resulted in more than $100,000 in charges to taxpayers, including $51,640 for a Mercedes and a chauffeur. Critics called the trips overly lavish in a time of economic downturn for the state. Although the director of the North Carolina Museum of Art defended Mary Easley's trips as possibly helping the museum to receive loaned art items from The Hermitage in St. Petersburg, the Raleigh News and Observer noted that no results of the trips were yet evident as of July 2008. As state auditor, Merritt released a report October 31, 2008 that found that 40% of the overseas charges were \"unreasonable or unallowable.\" Mary Easley has hired state Senator Tony Rand as her lawyer in dealing with Merritt. Merritt found that the $27,000, on-call chauffeured SUV often followed Mary Easley's tour bus through the countryside rather than serving as her transportation. In Russia, hundreds of dollars were charged to the state for both caviar and alcohol purchases. $45,000 in private funds from the NC Art Museum's foundation were used to reimburse the state following Merritt's findings."

They lived on Sherrif Brae. His early education was spent at Leith Grammar School, after which he became the apprentice of the Leith surgeon John Cheyne (father of John Cheyne), with the aim of going to sea. He also attended classes at the University of Edinburgh (1792\u201393), studying medicine, botany, chemistry, and natural history. His father's brother Robert Jameson, was also a physician and lived with them on Rotten Row. By 1793, influenced by the Regius Professor of Natural History, John Walker (1731\u20131803), Jameson abandoned medicine and the idea of being a ship's surgeon, and focused instead on science, particularly geology and mineralogy. It is worth noting that Walker was a presbyterian Minister who had actually combined the Regius Professorship with a period of service as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1790. In 1793, Jameson was given the responsibility of looking after the University's Natural History Collection. During this time his geological field-work frequently took him to the Isle of Arran, the Hebrides, Orkney, the Shetland Islands and the Irish mainland. In 1800, he spent a year at the mining academy in Freiberg, Saxony, where he studied under the noted geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner (1749 or 1750\u20131817). As an undergraduate, Jameson had several noteworthy classmates at the University of Edinburgh including Robert Brown, Joseph Black, and Thomas Dick. In 1799 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Andrew Coventry, Thomas Charles Hope and Andrew Duncan."

        "content": "In 1804, Jameson succeeded Dr Walker as the third Regius Professor of Natural History at the University of Edinburgh, a post which he held for fifty years. During this period he became the first eminent exponent in Britain of the Wernerian geological system, or Neptunism, and the acknowledged leader of the Scottish Wernerians, founding the Wernerian Natural History Society in 1808 and presiding from 1808 until around 1850, when his health began to decline, together with the fortunes of the Society. Jameson's support for Neptunism, a theory that argued that all rocks had been deposited from a primaeval ocean, initially pitted him against James Hutton (1726\u20131797), a fellow Scot and eminent geologist also based in Edinburgh (but not in the university), who argued for the uniformitarian deistic concept of Plutonism, that features of the Earth's crust were endlessly recycled in natural processes powered by magmatic molten rocks. Later, Jameson was willing to join forces with the proponents of Hutton, in 1826 writing that \"the Wernerian geognostical views and method of investigation, combined with the theory of Hutton; the experiments and speculations of Hall; the illustrations of Playfair\", had taken root in Edinburgh and spread to give Britain unsurpassed success in geology. In the April\u2013October 1826 edition of the quarterly Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal edited by Jameson, an anonymous paper praised \"Mr. Lamarck, one of the most sagacious naturalists of our day\" for having \"expressed himself in the most unambiguous manner. He admits, on the one hand, the existence of the simplest infusory animals; on the other, the existence of the simplest worms, by means of spontaneous generation, that is, by an aggregation process of animal elements; and maintains, that all other animals, by the operation of external circumstances, are evolved from these in a double series, and in a gradual manner.\" \u2013 this was the first use of the word \"evolved\" in a modern sense, and was the first significant statement to relate Lamarckism to the geological record of living organisms of the past. Attribution has been disputed, the concepts point to Jameson as the author, combining the directional geological history of Earth proposed by Neptunism with progressive transformism (transmutation of species) shown by fossils. It is possible that the article was written by one of his students, Ami Bou\u00e9 or Robert Edmond Grant. Jameson's references to the Deluge in notes to his translation of Georges Cuvier's Essay on the Theory of the Earth had done much to foster Catastrophism, but his 1827 edition referred to a \"succession of variations\" caused by environmental conditions having \"gradually conducted the classes of aquatic animals to their present state\". and a later chapter described how \"like the formation of rocks, we observe a regular succession of organic formations, the later always descending from the earlier, down to the present inhabitants of the earth, and to the last created being who was to exercise dominion over them\", summarising elements of the ideas of Giambattista Brocchi. As a teacher, Jameson had a mixed reputation for imparting enthusiasm to his students; Thomas Carlyle, who gave serious attention to Natural History, described Jameson's lecturing style as a \"blizzard of facts\" and Charles Darwin found the lectures boring, saying that they determined him \"never to attend to the study of geology\". The detailed syllabus of Jameson's lectures, as drawn up by him in 1826, shows the range of his teaching. The course in zoology began with a consideration of the natural history of human beings, and concluded with lectures on the philosophy of zoology, in which the first subject was Origin of the Species of Animals. (The Scotsman, 29 October 1935: p.\u00a08). Over Jameson's fifty-year tenure, he built up a huge collection of mineralogical and geological specimens for the Museum of Edinburgh University, including fossils, birds and insects. By 1852 there were over 74,000 zoological and geological specimens at the museum, and in Britain the natural history collection was second only to that of the British Museum. Shortly after his death, the University Museum was transferred to the British Crown and became part of the Royal Scottish Museum, now the Royal Museum, in Edinburgh's Chambers Street. He was also a prolific author of scientific papers and books, including the Mineralogy of the Scottish Isles (1800), his System of Mineralogy (1808), which ran to three editions, and Manual of Mineralogy (1821). In 1819, with Sir David Brewster (1781\u20131868), Jameson started the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal and became its sole editor in 1824. He died at his home, 21 Royal Circus in Edinburgh, on 19 April 1854 after two years of illness, and was interred at Warriston Cemetery. He lies on the north side of the main east\u2013west path near the old East Gate. He was succeeded in his post at Edinburgh University by Prof Edward Forbes."

He was soon supported by Prime Minister Alenka Bratu\u0161ek and Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel Erjavec. In January 2014 the Slovene government endorsed T\u00fcrk as its candidate for UN Secretary-General. He was later also supported by Prime Minister Miro Cerar and President Borut Pahor, as well as by Speaker of the National Assembly of Slovenia Milan Brglez (also a professor at the University of Ljubljana). In accordance with the UN procedure, the government of Slovenia nominated Danilo T\u00fcrk as candidate for UN Secretary-General on 8 February 2016. T\u00fcrk is an experienced member of the United Nations community. He served as the first Permanent Representative of the Republic of Slovenia to the UN and remained in New York as ambassador for eight years, from 1992 until 2000. As Slovenian representative he also presided over the United Nations Security Council twice. His work was recognised by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who chose T\u00fcrk as one of his close advisors and appointed him Assistant Secretary-General in 2000. He served in this position until 2005, when he returned to Slovenia to teach international law at the University of Ljubljana. T\u00fcrk has long been recognised as an expert and global advocate for human rights and his work has been connected with human rights and the fight for equality for more than 40 years. One element of human rights that Turk has been questioned about is the UN's role in the Haiti cholera outbreak that has been widely discussed and criticized. There has been indisputable evidence that the UN is the proximate cause for bringing cholera to Haiti. Peacekeepers sent to Haiti from Nepal were carrying asymptomatic cholera and they did not treat their waste properly before dumping it into Haiti's water stream. In an interview with the New York Times, T\u00fcrk was asked if cholera victims should receive compensation. He responded by saying he hopes the UN would \"provide the victims with a fair process and an effective remedy.\" St. Vincent followed this up during the UN informal dialogues by asking Mr. T\u00fcrk how he would place the pursuit of an effective remedy on his list of priorities. T\u00fcrk's response was that though the UN enjoys immunity from prosecution, \"there are other ways of establishing fair process and effectiveness\". He also stated \"current discussions that I know exist within the Secretariat and between the Secretariat and member states will produce such effectiveness and fairness.\" Following-up at the media stakeout, Inner City Press questioned T\u00fcrk about his statement that there may be some process going on behind the scenes to pay compensation. T\u00fcrk responded by saying that there have been informal conversations about the Haitian situation, and though he does not have full knowledge, he can say that \"this story is not closed.\" He admits that he values the importance of legal regulation including UN immunity, but he also believes in remedies and fair processes. 37 human rights organizations recently signed onto a UN Secretary General accountability pledge. This pledge asks the candidates to take action on two human rights violations that have tarnished the United Nations' image: failing to provide remedies for victims of cholera in Haiti, and sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers. T\u00fcrk issued a statement responding to Aids Free World and the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti, expressing his support for the organizations' efforts. While he acknowledges that he has \"clearly expressed [his] commitment to fairness towards the victims of cholera in Haiti and for substantial, credible and speedy investigations of the cases of sexual abuse committed by peacekeepers\", he cannot undertake formal pledges. Nevertheless, he reaffirms his commitment to better UN accountability and says \"it is abundantly clear where my heart is.\""

His mother, Renata Aldrovandi, played the piano to him as a child. Her father, Waldo Aldrovandi, was a pianist, opera conductor, and composer who emigrated to Australia after World War II. Einaudi started composing his own music as a teenager, first writing by playing a folk guitar. He began his musical training at the Conservatorio Verdi in Milan, obtaining a diploma in composition in 1982. That same year he took an orchestration class taught by Luciano Berio and was awarded a scholarship to the Tanglewood Music Festival. According to Einaudi, \"[Luciano Berio] did some interesting work with African vocal music and did some arrangements of Beatles songs, and he taught me that there is a sort of dignity inside music. I learnt orchestration from him and a very open way of thinking about music.\" He also learned by collaborating with musicians such as Ballak\u00e9 Sissoko from Mali and Djivan Gasparyan from Armenia.  His music is ambient, meditative, and often introspective, drawing on minimalism and contemporary pop."

After the multi-media-inspired Time Out in 1988, in 1992 he released Stanze, which he had composed for harp. The album was performed by Cecilia Chailly, one of the first musicians to use an electric harp. Einaudi released his first solo piano album, Le Onde, in 1996, under BMG. The album is based on the novel The Waves by British writer Virginia Woolf, and enjoyed mainstream success, particularly in Italy and the UK. His 1999 followup, Eden Roc, was also released on BMG, with shorter pieces. For the project he collaborated with the Armenian duduk musician Djivan Gasparyan. His next solo piano release, I Giorni (2001), was inspired by his travels in Africa. The solo piano track \"I Giorni\" was featured in a BBC promotion for arts and culture programs, and attracted much interest due to Greg James' airing of the piece on BBC Radio 1 in June 2011. James mentioned that he found the piece therapeutic when he was studying at university. Due to repeated airings that month, the track entered the UK Singles Chart at #32 on 12 June 2011. In 2003, Einaudi released the live album La Scala Concert 03.03.03, which was recorded at the famous La Scala opera house in Milan. His 2003 album Diario Mali is another collaboration, with Einaudi on piano and Malian musician Ballak\u00e9 Sissoko on kora. In 2004, Einaudi released the album Una Mattina on Decca Records. The 2006 album Divenire consists of piano accompanied by orchestra. The album also includes the artist's critically acclaimed track \"Primavera.\" It was recorded by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, with Einaudi as the piano master. Shortly after its release, Einaudi went on tour to various places in the UK, playing both the music on Divenire and orchestral arrangements of his other works. The album topped the iTunes classical chart. In October 2009, Nightbook was released. The album saw Einaudi take a new direction with his music as he incorporated synthesized sounds alongside his piano. The album was conceived and recorded in response to the German painter and sculptor Anselm Kiefer, as well as an exhibit space where Einaudi performed for a gallery opening for Kiefer. It was also inspired by the drums and electronics of the Whitetree Project, a performing trio Einaudi formed with Robert and Ronald Lippok of To Rococo Rot, a German electronic group. In Italy, the album went Gold with more than 35,000 copies sold. Einaudi's album In a Time Lapse was released on 21 January 2013, with US and Canadian supporting tours. He also appeared on KCRW in Los Angeles. On 17 September 2013, Einaudi performed various songs from In a Time Lapse, together with a new ensemble, at the annual iTunes Festival held at the Roundhouse in London. The group intimately rehearsed this performance in the barn of Einaudi's house. In March 2016, the world premiere of a new piano concerto, \"Domino\", took place at the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra."

He wrote several grammars and worked on comparative phonology and morphology. Rask traveled extensively to study languages, first to Iceland, where he wrote the first grammar of Icelandic, and later to Russia, Persia, India, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Shortly before his death, he was hired as professor of Eastern languages at the University of Copenhagen. Rask is especially known for his contributions to comparative linguistics, including an early formulation of what would later be known as Grimm's Law. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1829."

        "content": "Rask was born to Niels Hansen Rasch and Birthe Rasmusdatter in the village of Br\u00e6ndekilde near Odense on the Danish island of Funen. His father, a smallholder and tailor, was well-read and had a decently-sized book collection. As a child, Rask's scholastic abilities became apparent, and, in 1801, at the age of thirteen, he was sent to the Latin school in Odense, now known as the Odense Katedralskole. One of his friends from Latin school, Niels Matthias Petersen (1791\u20131862), who went on to be the first professor of Nordic languages at the University of Copenhagen, later remarked that \"His short stature, his lively eyes, the ease with which he moved and jumped over tables and benches, his unusual knowledge, and even his quaint peasant dress, attracted the attention of his fellow students\". At the Latin school, Rask's interest in Old Norse and Icelandic language and literature was awakened. His teacher, Jochum E. Suhr, loaned him a copy of Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla in Icelandic, and the rector, Ludvig Heiberg, gave him a new translation of the same work as a prize for his diligence. By comparing the original work and the translation, he was able to make an Icelandic vocabulary, cross-referencing the Icelandic words with cognates in Danish, Swedish, German, Dutch and English. In addition to Danish and Latin, Rask studied Greek, Hebrew, French and German at Odense. An interest in orthography also led Rask to develop his own spelling system for Danish that more closely resembled its pronunciation, and it was at this time that he changed the spelling of his last name from \"Rasch\" to \"Rask\"."

Although he was not particularly religious and even had expressed serious doubts, he signed up as a student of theology, although in practice he simply studied the grammar of various languages of his own choosing. By 1812, he had systematically studied Sami, Swedish, Faroese, English, Dutch, Gothic, Old English and Portuguese, and had started studies of German, French, Spanish, Italian, Greek, Latin, Russian, Polish and Czech, although Icelandic continued to be his main interest. In 1809, he finished his first book, Introduction to the Icelandic or Old Norse Language, which he published in Danish in 1811. It was a didactic grammar based on printed and manuscript materials accumulated by his predecessors in the same field of research. According to Hans Frede Nielsen, it exceeded anything previously published on the topic."

        "content": "In 1811, the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters put out a call for a prize essay on the topic of language history that would \"use historical critique and fitting examples to illuminate the source whence the old Scandinavian tongue can be most probably derived, to explain the character of the language and the relations that it has had through the middle ages to the Nordic as well as Germanic dialects, and to accurately ascertain the basic tenets upon which all derivation and comparison of these tongues should be constructed.\" In order to conduct research for the prize essay, Rask traveled to Sweden in 1812 with his friend Rasmus Nyerup. There, he studied Sami and Finnish in order to determine whether they were related to the Scandinavian languages. When he returned to Denmark, he was recommended to the Arnamagn\u00e6an Institute, which hired him to edit Bj\u00f6rn Halld\u00f3rsson's Icelandic Lexicon (1814), which had long remained in manuscript. From 1813 to 1815, Rask visited Iceland, where he became fluent in Icelandic and familiarized himself with Icelandic literature and customs. In 1814, while still living in Iceland, he finished his prize essay, \"Investigation of the Origin of the Old Norse or Icelandic Language\" (1818), in which he argued that Old Norse was related to the Germanic languages, including Gothic, to the Baltic and Slavic languages, and even to Classical Latin and Greek, which he grouped together under the label Thracian. He also argued that the Germanic languages were not related to Basque, Greenlandic, Finnish or the Celtic languages (on this last instance he was wrong, and he later acknowledged this). The academy accepted the essay but suggested that he could have spent more time comparing Icelandic with Persian and other Asian languages. Because of this, Rask envisioned a trip to India to study Asian languages such as Sanskrit, which was already being taught by philologists such as Franz Bopp and Friedrich Schlegel in Germany. In 1814, after returning from Iceland, Rask worked as a sub-librarian at the University of Copenhagen library."

He traveled first to Sweden, where he stayed for two years. During his time in Sweden, he took a short trip to Finland to study Finnish and published his Anglo-Saxon Grammar (1817) in Swedish. That same year, he published the first complete editions of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda and S\u00e6mundr fr\u00f3\u00f0i's Poetic Edda. The editions were bilingual, with the original Icelandic accompanied by his Swedish translations. In 1819, he left Stockholm for St. Petersburg, Russia, where he wrote the paper \"The Languages and Literature of Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Finland,\" which published in German in the sixth volume of the Vienna Jahrb\u00fccher. Leaving Russia, he traveled through Central Asia to Persia, where he stayed in Tabriz, Tehran, Persepolis, and Shiraz. In about six weeks, he was said to have mastered enough Persian to be able to converse freely. In 1820, he traveled from Bushehr, Persia to Mumbai, India (then called Bombay), and during his residence there, he wrote (in English) \"A Dissertation on the Authenticity of the Zend Language\" (1821). From Bombay, he traveled through India to Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon), arriving in 1822. Soon afterwards, he wrote (in English) \"A Dissertation respecting the best Method of expressing the Sounds of the Indian Languages in European Characters\"."

Grant. Morrill was an accomplished politician serving in several elected and appointed offices throughout his lifetime. Morrill, as Secretary of Treasury, was devoted to hard currency rather than paper money. He dedicated himself to serve the public good rather than party interests. Morrill was popularly received as Treasury Secretary by the American press and Wall Street, and was known for his financial and political integrity.  Morrill was President Grant's fourth and last Secretary of the Treasury. A native of Maine, Morrill was educated in public school and after briefly attending Waterville College served as principal of a private school in New York. He studied law and passed the bar in 1839, afterwards setting up law practices in Readfield and Augusta, Maine.  Morrill, known for his eloquent speaking, soon become popular among Democratic friends advocating temperance.  Morrill was elected to Maine's House of Representatives in 1854 as a Democrat and served as Chairman of the Maine Democratic Party. However, as the nation divided over slavery during the 1850s, Morrill's politics changed and he went over to the Republican Party for the sole reason that the Republicans were opposed to the expansion of slavery. He was elected Maine's state senator in 1856 as a Republican, and elected Governor of Maine in 1858, serving until 1861 during the outbreak of the American Civil War. Morrill was elected Maine's U.S. Senator in 1861 when a vacancy opened in the U.S. Senate, after Sen. Hannibal Hamlin assumed the office of Vice President under President Abraham Lincoln.  Morrill's extended tenure for almost 15 years as U.S. Senator took place during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Morrill sponsored legislation that outlawed slavery in Washington D.C. and advocated education and suffrage for African American freedmen. In 1876, Sen. Morrill was appointed U.S. Secretary of the Treasury by President Grant, to fill in a vacancy after Sec. Benjamin Bristow resigned from office. His political rival James G. Blaine was appointed Maine's Senator after Morrill resigned from the Senate to accept the position of Secretary of Treasury.  Morrill's tenure was less than a year. Upon his retirement from the Treasury Department, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Morrill to the Collector of Customs in Portland, Maine, where he held this position until his death in 1883."

As a speaker, Morrill gained much experience in state politics.  Morrill started a law practice in Augusta; his partners were James W. Bradbury and Richard D. Rice. In 1849, Morrill became Chairman of Maine's Democratic Party and served in this position until 1856. As a Democrat, Morrill was elected to Maine's House of Repusentatives in 1854. Morrill began to break from his party's platform starting in 1855 eventually changing over to the Republican Party; having opposed Democratic concessions to slave states. During the Presidential election of 1856, Morrill believed James Buchanan was a good candidate, however he stated the Democratic Party's platform was \"a flagrant outrage upon the country and an insult to the North\".  Morrill's change of political views were shared by his brother, Anson P. Morrill, and his friend and future Vice President Hannibal Hamlin. Morrill, completely severed ties with the Democratic Party and formally became a Republican in 1856.  As a member of the Republican Party, Morrill was elected a Maine state senator in 1856, serving as Senate President.  He was the first Republican to hold the position which would be held by Republicans until 1964, with one brief exception.  He was elected Governor of Maine in 1858. (His brother Anson P.

In February 1861, Morrill attended the Peace Conference of 1861 and opposed John J. Crittenden's compromise arguments, similar to those made in the Crittenden Compromise. In March 1862, Morrill supported legislation that permitted the freedom of confiscated Confederate slaves captured during the War. Morrill believed this would be an effective military weapon against the Southern rebellion. In April 1862, Morrill spoke in favor of a bill that passed Congress; signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln that freed slaves in Washington, D.C. By the end of the war, he argued against punishing the southern states for the rebellion, and in favor of higher education for people of all races."

He was then apprenticed to his maternal uncle, Dr James Mundell, a surgeon in Dumfries. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University, and became a surgeon in the navy in 1807. He traveled with John Franklin in search of the Northwest Passage on the Coppermine Expedition of 1819\u20131822. Richardson wrote the sections on geology, botany and ichthyology for the official account of the expedition. Franklin and Richardson returned to Canada in 1825 and went overland by fur trade routes to the mouth of the Mackenzie River. Franklin was to go as far west as possible and Richardson was to go east to the mouth of the Coppermine River.  These were the only known points on the central coast and had been reached in 1793 and 1771 respectively. He had with him two specially-built boats which were more ocean-worthy than the voyageur canoes used by Franklin on his previous expedition. They gave their names to the Dolphin and Union Strait near the end of his route. His journey was successful and he reached his furthest east the same day that Franklin reached his furthest west (16 August 1826). He abandoned his boats at Bloody Falls and trekked overland to Fort Franklin which he reached three weeks before Franklin. Together they had surveyed 1,878 miles of previously unmapped coast. The natural history discoveries of this expedition were so great that they had to be recorded in two separate works, the Flora Boreali-Americana (1833\u201340), written by William Jackson Hooker, and the Fauna Boreali-Americana (1829\u201337), written by Richardson, William John Swainson, John Edward Gray and William Kirby. At the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in 1842, Richardson described the diving apparatus and treatment of diver Roderick Cameron following an injury that occurred on 14 October 1841 during the salvage operations on . Richardson was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1846. He traveled with John Rae on an unsuccessful search for Franklin in 1848\u201349, describing it in An Arctic Searching Expedition (1851). He retired to the Lake District in 1855. He died at his home Lancrigg House north of Grasmere on 5 June 1865, and is buried at St Oswald's Church, Grasmere."

Born in Hollywood, California and raised in Ventura, Larrabee was a young running talent in the mid-1950s. In 1952, his athletic performances earned him a scholarship at the University of Southern California, from which he graduated as a geology major. A series of injuries hampered his running career, causing him to miss out on the 1956 and 1960 Olympics, but he had his best season in 1964. He won his only AAU title in 400 m, then he won the 400 m (tying the world record of 44.9 seconds) at the 1964 Olympic Trials in Los Angeles. In the Tokyo Olympics final, Larrabee was in fifth place going into the final turn, then passed everyone in front of him with a burst of speed to win the gold medal in 45.1. Larrabee also ran the second leg on United States gold medal winning 4 \u00d7 400 m relay team that won in the world record time of 3:00.7. After the Tokyo Olympics Larrabee worked as a mathematics teacher at James Monroe High School, ran a beverage distributing company with his brother and worked part-time as Adidas\u2019 U.S. shoe representative to track and field, a position that allowed him to travel and keep connected to the sport. Larrabee remained physically active well after his running career had wound down, taking up tennis, scuba diving, skiing, hiking (for which he raised llamas as pack animals) and mountain climbing. Although he was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer in 2001 and was only expected to live a few weeks, he continued to live life to the fullest for two more years, thanks to chemotherapy treatments.  Mike Larrabee died in his home at Santa Maria, California, aged 69.  He was posthumously added to the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in December 2003. The stadium at Ventura High School, which he attended, is named for him."

        "content": "In 1902 Barringer learned of the existence of a large (1.5\u00a0km in diameter) crater, located 35 miles east of Flagstaff, Arizona. The crater, now called Meteor Crater, had previously been studied by the geologist Grove Karl Gilbert in 1891. Gilbert had hypothesized that the crater must have been the result of either a gas explosion or a meteorite. After performing experiments in the crater, however, Gilbert's conclusion was that the crater could not be the result of an impact, and therefore could only be the result of an explosion. He concluded this despite the clear presence of thousands of small meteoritic particles in the vicinity of the crater. Upon hearing of the existence of the crater and the meteoritic iron, Barringer became convinced that the crater was of meteoritic origin. With both scientific and monetary aims in mind, Barringer created the \"Standard Iron Company\" in order to mine the crater for the iron that he assumed must be buried below its surface. The Standard Iron Company conducted drilling operations in and around the crater between 1903 and 1905, and concluded that the crater had indeed been caused by a violent impact. It was unable to find the meteorite, however."

Tilghman, presented their first papers to the U.S. Geological Survey outlining the evidence in support of the impact theory. The papers were published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. By the late 1920s, Barringer had convinced most of the scientific community that his impact theory was correct. The theory has been further confirmed with new evidence since then, most notably by Eugene Shoemaker during the 1960s. The mining of the crater continued until 1929 without ever finding the ten-million ton meteorite that Barringer assumed must be hidden. By this point Barringer had spent over $600,000 with no iron profits to show for it, nearly bankrupting him. At this time the astronomer Forest Ray Moulton performed calculations on the energy expended by the meteorite on impact, and concluded that the meteorite had most likely vaporized when it landed."

He helped bring the Golden Eagles to the Final Four for the first time since their 1977 national championship season. Wade was subsequently named to the All-America First Team by the Associated Press (AP), making him the first basketball player from Marquette to receive the distinction since 1978. Wade's performance during the Midwest Regional final drew national attention. Against a top-seeded Kentucky team, he delivered 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists, including a memorable breakaway dunk, as Marquette upset the Wildcats, 83\u201369, and advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 1977. Wade's triple double was the fourth ever recorded in NCAA tournament history. The Golden Eagles finished their season as No.6 in the AP Poll, Marquette's highest ranking since 1976\u201377. Wade was named the MVP of the Midwest Regional. His performance earned him a high NBA draft projection. As a result, Wade skipped his senior year to enter the 2003 NBA draft. Marquette retired his jersey on February 3, 2007. It ordinarily requires student-athletes to have graduated for jersey retirement, but made an exception for Wade."

On offense, he was one of the quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well as one of the best slashers in NBA history. Wade's signature one-two step allowed him to dash past bigger defenders and draw fouls. Wade ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48 minutes in 2004\u201305 and again in the 2006\u201307 season. Wade was an unselfish player, averaging 5.4 assists for his career. After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the league's premier clutch players. David Thorpe, an athletic trainer who runs a training center for NBA players, cited Wade's post-up game as one of his strengths. Thorpe said that Wade's best moves from the post were his turnaround jump shot, double pivot, and what Thorpe termed a \"freeze fake\", a pump fake Wade used to get his opponent to jump, so that he could drive around him. Wade's main weakness was three-point shooting; he averaged 29% for his career. Wade was best known for his ability to convert difficult lay-ups, even after hard mid-air collisions with larger defenders. His style drew concerns over the dangers of playing in this manner, as Wade had hurt his knees and wrists after mid-air collisions with larger players. Wade established himself on defense for his ability to block shots and accumulate steals. He holds the NBA record for blocks for players listed  and under, which he achieved in only 679 games, over 400 games less than the previous record-holder: Dennis Johnson (1,100)."

        "content": "Wade married his high school girlfriend Siohvaughn Funches in 2002. They split in 2007, and he divorced her in 2010 after an acrimonious court battle. In 2011, Wade was granted sole custody of his two children. Wade also raises a nephew, the son of Wade's sister Deanna. Wade began dating actress Gabrielle Union in 2008. According to Wade, he and Union briefly split up at some point early in 2013 due to career demands. During that time, Wade and Aja Metoyer conceived a son. Wade and Union became engaged in December 2013, and married on August 30, 2014, in Miami. On November 7, 2018, Wade became a father for the fourth time, when he and Union welcomed their daughter, who was born via surrogate. In 2020, Wade's 12-year-old child came out as a transgender girl and changed her name to Zaya. Wade's nicknames include D-Wade and Flash, which was given to him by former teammate Shaquille O'Neal who would sing, \"He's the greatest in the Universe\", in reference to the Queen song of the same name from the 1980 film Flash Gordon. The Heat's 2005 NBA playoffs run and Wade's performances while O'Neal was hampered by injury, led to media attention and rapid increase in Wade's popularity. During those playoffs, Wade's jersey became the league's top-selling jersey and remained so for nearly two years. After the Heat's success and Wade's memorable performances during the 2006 NBA playoffs, Wade appeared on several talk shows, including Late Show with David Letterman and Live with Regis and Kelly. He also made a guest star appearance on Disney Channel's Austin & Ally as himself, who is an obsessed fan of Austin Moon. Wade has been featured in magazine articles and publications. In 2005, he was featured on People's 50 Most Beautiful People, and in 2006 he was named the NBA's best-dressed player by GQ. In 2007, Esquire named him to their 4th annual Best Dressed Men in the World list for the second straight year. Wade's endorsement deals included Gatorade, Lincoln, Staples, Sean John, T-Mobile (his TV commercials paired him with Charles Barkley), and Topps. He had his own line of shoes with Converse named \"The Wade\" and a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition with T-Mobile. During the 2009\u201310 season, Wade switched from Converse to Nike's Jordan Brand. Wade was chosen by Jordan and debuted the Air Jordan 2010 during the 2010 NBA All-Star break. During the 2011 NBA playoffs, Wade debuted his first signature shoe for the Jordan Brand, joining Anthony and Chris Paul, who had their own signature shoes. After his Jordan Brand contract expired in 2012, Wade signed with the Chinese athletic brand Li-Ning. Wade was included in Time's list of the 100 most influential people of 2020. In April 2021, Wade became a minority owner of the Utah Jazz. In October 2021, Wade's eldest son, Zaire Wade got drafted by the Salt Lake City Stars, which is the NBA G League affiliate of the Utah Jazz. In March 2021, when asked about Michael Jordan, Wade stated that Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. He explained, \"I come from a Jordan era. I am biased and I'm going to be biased until the day I pass away. Michael Jordan will be my GOAT. I'm not taking anything away from LeBron. LeBron is amazing. But Michael Jordan is my GOAT.\" Wade stated that Michael Jordan was his favorite player growing up. He explained, \"For me, from Chicago, where I grew up, I made it out the hood because I seen a dude, No. 23, play the game of basketball at a level that I was like, I just want to do some of that.\""

In 2003, he founded The Wade's World Foundation, which provides support to community-based organizations that promote education, health, and social skills for children in at-risk situations. He hosts a variety of community outreach programs in Chicago and South Florida. In 2008, he announced his partnership with former teammate Alonzo Mourning's charitable foundation and co-hosted ZO's Summer Groove, an annual summer event. On December 24, 2008, Wade purchased a new home for a South Florida woman whose nephew accidentally burned down the family home. In addition, Wade donated furnishings, clothing and gifts to the family. After breaking his own Miami Heat single-season scoring record, Wade gave the jersey he wore in that night's victory to 8-year-old Michael Stolzenberg, an avid Heat fan who lost his hands and feet due to a bacterial infection. Wade stated that he knew Stolzenberg previously and wished to add to his collection of Heat memorabilia. Wade is known for visiting other sick children, usually in private to avoid the media spotlight. In September 2009, Wade donated money from his foundation to keep the Robbins, Illinois public library from having to shut down. He handed library director Priscilla Coatney a $25,000 check in order to resurrect the building. In January 2010, Wade and Mourning co-founded The Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti\", which raised money to help the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the three days after the fund began soliciting donations from athletes, Wade announced that the \"Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti\" had already raised over $800,000. Wade stated, \"I expected nothing less from my friends and colleagues in the sports community, our commitment to this cause knows no bounds, and we will continue to accept any and all donations throughout the days ahead.\" Wade is also an avid supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and served as an Ambassador for their Hoops for St. Jude basketball initiative."

She then returned to Manitoba to work for the provincial government. She ran in the 2011 federal election in the district of Winnipeg North, receiving 35.41 per cent of the vote, narrowly losing to Kevin Lamoureux of the Liberal Party by 44 votes (0.17 per cent)."

He was the son of Samuel Gilman Brown (1813\u20131885), president of Hamilton College from 1867 to 1881, and the grandson of Francis Brown, whose removal from the presidency of Dartmouth College and later restoration were incidental to the famous Dartmouth College case. The younger Francis graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover in 1866, from Dartmouth in 1870 and from the Union Theological Seminary in 1877, and then studied in Berlin. In 1879 he became instructor in biblical philology at the Union Theological Seminary, in 1881 an associate professor of the same subject, and in 1890 Davenport Professor of Hebrew and the cognate Languages. Brown's published works won him an honorary doctorate of Divinity from the University of Glasgow (1901), and a D.Litt. from the University of Oxford, as well as honorary doctorates from Dartmouth and Yale. The works are, with the exception of The Christian Point of View (1902; with Profs. A. C. McGiffert and G. W. Knox), almost purely linguistic and lexical, and include Assyriology: its Use and Abuse in Old Testament Study (1885), and the important revision of Gesenius' Lexicon, undertaken with S. R.

Born in a wealthy home, Bou\u00e9  studied in Hamburg and Geneva before going to study medicine at Edinburgh from  1814 to 1817. Here he came under the influence of Robert Jameson, whose teachings in geology and mineralogy inspired his future career. Bou\u00e9 was thus led to make geological expeditions to various parts of Scotland and the Hebrides, and after taking his degree of M.D. in 1817 he settled for some years in Paris. In 1820 he issued his Essai g\u00e9ologique sur l'\u00c9cosse, in which the eruptive rocks in particular were carefully described. He travelled much in Germany, Austria and southern Europe, studying various geological formations, and becoming one of the pioneers in geological research; he was one of the founders of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9ologique de France in 1830, and was its president in 1835.

        "content": "Eugene Talmadge was born in 1884 in Forsyth, Georgia, to Thomas and Carrie (Roberts) Talmadge. He attended the University of Georgia and graduated from the university's law school. While at UGA, he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society and Sigma Nu fraternity. Talmadge set up a law practice in Telfair County, Georgia and joined the Democratic Party. He twice ran for the Georgia state legislature and lost both times. He was elected as state agriculture commissioner in 1926. Talmadge was re-elected commissioner in 1928 and 1930. In 1908 the Democratic-dominated legislature passed a constitutional amendment that effectively disenfranchised most African Americans in Georgia. This institutionalized the Democratic Party's dominance in the state, in a pattern that had been repeated across most of the former Confederate states since 1890, when Mississippi was the first to pass such legislation. As commissioner, Talmadge used the newspaper of his department to give advice to farmers and promote  his political views, extolling the virtues of a laissez-faire economic policy and individual action to improve the well-being of farmers. During his time as agriculture commissioner, Talmadge also developed a reputation for being a corrupt, freewheeling individual who disregarded standard ethics and played by his own set of rules.  He maintained widespread support among Georgia's rural white communities. He was an \"admitted flogger and racial demagogue who presided over a Klan-ridden regime\". The State Senate concluded that Talmadge violated a state law requiring that fertilizer fees collected by the agriculture department be deposited in the state treasury.  He was criticized for paying himself and family members more than $40,000 in salaries and expenses, and using department funds to make trips to the Kentucky Derby.  Accused of \"stealing\" $20,000 in order to raise the price of hogs, Talmadge told one group of farmers, \"Sure, I stole it!  But I stole it for you.\" The State House declined requests to impeach Talmadge but agreed to sue him to recover state funds spent on the hog price manipulation scheme.  When Governor Richard B. Russell Jr. referred the suit to the state attorney general, however, the request to sue Talmadge was rejected."

        "title": "Eugene Talmadge_Governor",
        "content": "In 1932, Governor Richard B. Russell, Jr. ran as a candidate for the United States Senate. Talmadge ran for governor, appealing to white rural Georgia by idealizing the small farmer, and preaching what he said were the true values of rural America, such as rugged individualism, frugality, governmental economy, segregation, limited government, and low taxes. Talmadge won a majority of the county unit votes and therefore the primary. Winning the nomination of the Democratic Party was tantamount to automatic victory in the general election. The Republican Party in the state had been essentially hollowed out and made non-competitive by the effective disenfranchisement of African-American voters after 1908. Because all counties were given equal weight, the County Unit System gave outsized power to the rural counties, which were Talmadge's base. He boasted, \"I can carry any county that ain't got street cars.\"  He made twelve campaign promises, the most controversial of which was to lower the price of an automobile license to $3, putting them within reach of the poorest farmers.  The state legislature intensely debated the $3 license fee issue, but did not pass it. After it adjourned, Talmadge fixed the $3 fee by proclamation. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt developed the New Deal with programs to hire unemployed men to work on various public works projects. These were often for needed infrastructure identified by the states. In the South, these jobs offered higher wages than men could obtain in the private sector, and black men were paid the same rate as white men. Many of the wealthy white land-owning families in Georgia soon complained to Talmadge that their sharecroppers preferred to work on the better-paying New Deal public works projects rather than as sharecroppers, and asked the governor to intercede with the president. In 1933, one sharecropper wrote to Talmadge: \"I wound't [wouldn't] plow nobody's mule from sunrise to sunset for 50 cents a day when I could get $1.30 for pretending to work on a DITCH\". A disgusted Talmadge forwarded the letter to Roosevelt, together with his own letter that stated: \"I take it that you approve of paying farm labor 40 to 50 cents per day\". Roosevelt wrote back: \"Somehow I cannot get into my head that wages on such a scale make possible a reasonable American standard of living\". For all his populism and his self-image as the defender of the small white farmers of Georgia, Talmadge tended to side with the interests of the wealthier land-owning families of the state. He was strongly opposed to Roosevelt's efforts to raise wages in the South, believing that this would undercut the South's only economic advantage, namely of having the lowest wages in the United States. Roosevelt by contrast believed that raising wages would increase consumption and hence spur the economy out of the Great Depression. When Georgia textile workers went on strike on September 1, 1934, Talmadge declared martial law during the third week of the strike. He directed four thousand National Guard troops to arrest all picketers throughout the state. He ordered the prisoners to be held behind the barbed wire of a former World War I prisoner of war camp for trial by a military tribunal. While the state interned about one hundred or so picketers, the show of force effectively ended picketing throughout most of the state. When Talmadge discovered that one of the employers had hired the notorious strikebreaker Pearl Bergoff, he had Bergoff and his two hundred men detained by the Georgia National Guard and deported to New York City. Although often tied to both controversy and corruption, Talmadge was re-elected in 1934, carrying every county but three in the state's Democratic primary. When the Public Service Commission, a body elected by the voters, refused to lower utility rates, he appointed a new board to get it done.  When the Highway Board resisted his efforts to control it, Talmadge declared martial law and appointed more cooperative members to the board. When the state treasurer and comptroller general refused to cooperate, the governor ordered state police to remove them physically from their offices in the state capitol. Critics denounced him as a dictator, a demagogue, and a threat to the tranquility of the state. His supporters considered him to be a friend of the \"common man\" and one of the state's most outstanding governors. In October 1934, Talmadge ousted John Cohen, the pro-New Deal chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party, and replaced him with Hugh Howell, a Talmadge partisan. Roosevelt met with Talmadge to ask him to save Cohen's job, a request that was refused, leading the president to suspect that this was the first step by Talmadge toward a possible presidential run in 1936. By late 1934, Talmadge's relationship with Roosevelt was fraying. In December 1934, when Roosevelt decided to spent Christmas at Warm Springs, Georgia, Talmadge sent a note requesting a private meeting with the president. His staff responded by a note apologizing for Roosevelt not having the time to see the governor, and vaguely promising him a private meeting at the White House sometime in 1935. By early 1935, Talmadge was working on an alliance with US Senator Huey Long (D-Louisiana), who was planning on running against Roosevelt in 1936. When asked what was discussed at his meetings with Long, Talmadge replied: \"We both cussed Roosevelt\". But, Long had a low opinion of Talmadge's intelligence, saying: \"That Talmadge ain't got the brains to match his ambition\". Beyond a shared antipathy to Roosevelt, the two had almost nothing in common politically. Long, a left-wing populist, had the slogan of \"share the wealth\", promising if elected president he would confiscate all the wealth of the richest Americans and redistribute it to the poor, whereas Talmadge was essentially an old-fashioned Southern conservative. Long criticized Roosevelt for not going far enough with the New Deal, while Talmadge had felt he had gone too far. Finally, both men wanted to run for president and wanted the other to serve as vice president, which proved to be the issue that ended their alliance and made them enemies. Talmadge governed as a Southern conservative, vehemently attacking the nationalization of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. He objected to policies favorable to black people (President Roosevelt did not introduce any civil rights measures), the farm programs, and relief-work programs such as the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps. Talmadge believed the New Deal relief programs were encouraging people to be lazy, telling a reporter: \"The way to handle a relief program was like how Mussolini was handling it in Italy, namely to line these people up and take the troops and make them work\". Talmadge tried to build a region-wide coalition, making a national speaking tour in preparation for a challenge to FDR in 1936. Talmadge's main allies were the Reverend Gerald L. K. Smith, who had been the principal organizer of Long's Share Our Wealth Clubs; John Henry Kirby, a wealthy Texas businessman who had been a leading Long supporter; and novelist Thomas Dixon Jr., a white supremacist whose books glorifying the Ku Klux Klan were very popular at the time. Talmadge's bid was being financed with some $41,000 dollars contributed by Alfred Sloan, CEO of General Motors, together with money from the Raskob and du Pont families. His Southern Committee to Uphold the Constitution organized a convention in Macon, Georgia, in January 1936 that brought together fragments of the old Huey P. Long coalition. The Macon convention turned out to be a media disaster that ended Talmadge's presidential hopes. The populist platform that Talmadge drafted at his Macon convention, with its call for more silver to be mined to support the silver standard, more protectionism, more states rights, more isolationism, and less immigration was widely mocked as more appropriate for the 19th century than the 20th. Talmadge pledged to defend the \"sovereignty of our states and local self-government\" at the upcoming Democratic National Convention. However, Roosevelt, who visited Warm Springs, Georgia, often because of his past polio, was more popular with the poor farmers. Unable to run for re-election in 1936, Talmadge chose to challenge Senator Russell in the primary, but Russell defeated Talmadge by a landslide and Talmadge's presidential hopes collapsed.  Talmadge's handpicked candidate for governor, Charles Redwine, lost the 1936 Georgia gubernatorial election to pro-New Deal Democrat Eurith D. Rivers by an overwhelming margin. In 1936, according to a United Press (UP) article printed in the Atlanta Constitution on August 21, 1936, titled \"Gene Selects Hitler as Favorite 'Author'\", Talmadge reportedly told a Los Angeles newspaper that while he didn't have time to read many books, he read Adolf Hitler's book Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\") seven times. The Nazi publication Die Bewegung reprinted the interview with Talmadge and praised him, stating that \"Governor Eugene Talmadge, of Georgia, is obviously a very intelligent man.\" In 1938, Talmadge challenged incumbent U.S. senator Walter F. George. Though George had sided with 34 of Roosevelt's 44 New Deal proposals, he refused to support some of the proposals in Roosevelt's second term. The president believed George had been \"put out to pasture\". Roosevelt tried to purge George and campaigned for his own candidate, Lawrence Camp. George, however, refused to criticize Roosevelt during the campaign and blamed the purge on Roosevelt's advisers.  Despite the divide among the New Deal vote, George easily won the renomination, securing 141,922 popular votes and a majority of 246 county unit votes, while Talmadge won just 102,464 popular votes and 148 unit votes. Talmadge's victory over Roosevelt's candidate Camp, who secured just 78,223 popular votes and 16 unit votes, surprised his critics."

        "content": "Talmadge was elected again as governor in 1940 and returned to the governor's office in 1941, emerging as the leader of racist and segregationist elements in Georgia.  Responding to reports that Walter Cocking, a dean at the University of Georgia, had advocated bringing black and white students together in the classroom, Talmadge launched an attack on the university, charging elitism, and called for the regents to remove Cocking and purge the university of communists, \"foreigners\" (non-Georgians), and subscribers to racial equality. The university board of regents at first refused Talmadge's demands, but after the governor restructured the board, the university dismissed numerous staff. This intervention into academic affairs caused the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to remove accreditation from the Georgia state universities. It also contributed to Talmadge's defeat by Ellis Arnall in 1942. In 1940\u20131941, Talmadge took a strongly isolationist line and was opposed to Roosevelt's policy of having America be the \"arsenal of democracy\". He said that money spent in aiding Britain, China and the Soviet Union would have been better spent on helping the poor farmers of Georgia. The fact that Talmadge had an admiration for Hitler and voiced such strong support for Japan's war against China that the Japanese government invited him to visit Japan on all-expenses paid vacation (an offer he declined) led to allegations that he was an Axis-sympathizer. Some commentators felt that Talmadge was merely naive, a man who knew nothing about the affairs of Europe and Asia, while others charged that his authoritarian style of leadership made him naturally sympathetic towards fascist regimes. About the charge that he acting like a dictator, Talmadge replied: \"I'm what you call a minor dictator. But did you ever see anybody that was much good who didn't have a little dictator in him?\" Talmadge's biographer, William Anderson, wrote that Talmadge's admiration for Nazi Germany, his tendency to surround himself with paramilitary followers, and his frequent calls for martial law gave \"an eerie backing\" for his words. At the same time, the Cocking Affair had badly damaged Talmadge's reputation. Arnall was a supporter of segregation, whose views on race were essentially the same as Talmadge's, but he presented himself as a supporter of better education for Georgians. Arnall noted that nobody could beat Talmadge in what he cynically called the \"nigger-hating contest\", and argued that the issue in the \"Cocking Affair\" was not white supremacy, as Talmadge claimed, but education. Arnall charged that Georgia's universities losing their accreditation, which Talmadge presented as an achievement on his part, put at risk the futures of all the students attending the universities.\u00a0At a time when most Georgians were living in poverty and few attended higher education, the possibility that those young people who were lucky enough to attend university or might be would lose their chances to escape lives of poverty was widely regarded as unacceptable. Those Georgians whose children were attending the university were outraged that the futures of their children had been at risk, and those whose children were not attending university had hopes that someday they might. The students at Georgia's universities and colleges championed vigorously against Talmadge, putting on skits that mocked the governor as a power-crazed buffoon just before football games. They were disproportionately over-represented as volunteers in the Arnall campaign. When Talmadge held campaign rallies, students showed up to chant \"To Hell with Talmadge!\" At one Talmadge campaign rally on 2 July 1942, a Talmadge supporter threw a canister of tear gas at the students, an incident that attracted much negative comment and led to demands that Talmadge discipline his \"hoodlums\" who always patrolled his rallies. Talmadge was so unpopular with students that his campaign workers in the university town of Athens urged him not to hold a campaign rally there, predicting that more people would come out to boo him than cheer him. Realizing that Arnall had cast himself as stronger on the education issue, Talmadge changed tactics and announced simply that the loss of accreditation to Georgia's universities did not matter, saying at one rally in a rural area: \"They talk about education. It ain't never taught a man how to plant cotton. It ain't made a garden bloom. It ain't never taught the experience necessary to raise cows and chickens. You gotta git out and do them things, and no school education is going to help ya\". This message was intended to appeal to the white farmers who traditionally supported Talmadge, but may have inadvertently hurt him as even many of Talmadge's rural supporters knew that a better education represented their children's best hope of escaping poverty, and did not appreciate the implied message that the best thing that could happen to their children would be to follow their parents in lives of drudgery and poverty. As was always the case, Talmadge presented himself as an aggressive defender of white supremacy, arguing keeping the black people disfranchised and segregated was far more important than education, a message that appealed to his core supporters, but to nobody else. At one campaign rally, Talmadge stated: \"We in the South love the Negro in his place-but his place is at the back door\". The fact that Arnall had also declared himself a supporter of segregation, albeit not in quite the same crude terms as Talmadge had, meant that for many white Georgians there was no difference between the candidates on \"the Negro question\", and therefore neutralized Talmadge's advantage as an defender of white supremacy. Furthermore, men were more likely to vote for Talmadge than women, and in 1942, many Georgian men were serving in the military, thus leading to women being over-represented in the Democratic primary. In the primary, Arnall won 174,575 votes to Talmadge's 128,394. Even the \"county unit system\", which worked to Talmadge's advantage in the past, failed to save him in 1942. Arnall won 242 unit votes to Talmadge's 149."

        "content": "Just after Talmadge left office in January 1943, it emerged that since 1940 that he had been receiving food grown on the state prison farms for free, an allegation that he admitted to, saying he was saving the state of Georgia money by not paying for his food. Shortly afterwards, it emerged that he attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, which he again admitted to, saying that \"everyone had a good time\" at the Klan banquet.\u00a0In his retirement, Talmadge grew increasingly bitter and became consumed with a violent hatred for Roosevelt. The isolationist Talmadge also deplored the United States fighting in World War II, all the more so as the social changes caused by the war were threatening Talmadge's vision of what an ideal America should be. In particular, the first tentative gains made by the Civil rights movement in the war years enraged Talmadge, who predicated that even the modest gains being made by black Americans during the war would eventually lead to the end of white supremacy in the South. Talmadge convinced himself that Roosevelt had deliberately engineered the United States's entry into World War II because he wanted to create the social changes that would end white supremacy, causing him to engage in long tirades against Roosevelt, the New Deal, World War II and black Americans. Talmadge's newspaper, The Statesmen printed editorials written by himself claiming that Roosevelt was compromising American sovereignty, making the allegation that the British prime minister Winston Churchill was being allowed to \"meddle\" in the affairs of Congress with Roosevelt's support. In the 1944 election, The Statesmen ran a headline reading \"Election of Roosevelt Means Promoting Negroes in Georgia\".\u00a0Anderson wrote during the war Talmadge became a \"total cultural isolationist\", a man who saw the world outside of the United States as a dangerous, menacing place and believed increasing American involvement with the world beyond would destroy everything that he held sacred. At the same time, Talmadge, always a heavy drinker, started to drink on a scale that began to seriously damage his health. Anderson described Talmadge as \"a ghost's voice hellbent on halting the future. But it was a frightened voice, scared that the wave of history had at last washed over the impenetrable culture of his fathers. So easily had his people succumbed to the siren call of change that Gene found himself with one hoary root left, one last undeniable link to yesterday-the black. He alone anchored the old consciousness, the tenacious culture, the old consciousness. Gene Talmadge knew if this one tie was uprooted, his world would be gone forever.\" When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the 1944 Smith v. Allwright decision that white-only primaries were illegal and ordered Southern states to hold color-blind primaries, Talmadge was enraged and based his entire effort on a political comeback on a virulently racist platform of upholding white supremacy."

        "content": "During Arnall's term, the state legislature lengthened his term to four years and prohibited him from seeking re-election in 1946. Talmadge ran for governor and used the Smith v. Allwright decision, ruling that the closed white primary was unconstitutional, as his main red flag issue. Talmadge promised that if he were to be elected, he would restore the \"Equal Primary\". Talmadge's family and advisers sought to persuade him not to run, warning that due to his failing health that a grueling campaign might kill him, but he refused to step aside in favor of his son Herman who had been groomed as his heir, saying \"Naw, I'm the only goddamn son of a bitch who can win\". Talmadge's campaign was noted for its violent racist rhetoric as he boasted about assaulting and flogging the black sharecroppers who worked for his family as a young man and he claimed to have chased a black man down the street with an ax because he sat next to a white woman. In June 2007, previously sealed FBI files revealed that Talmadge was investigated by the FBI over suspicions he sanctioned the Moore's Ford lynching. Through Talmadge was unpopular in the more populous urban areas, his relative popularity in rural areas gave him a fighting chance of still winning the Democratic nomination under the  \"county unit votes\" system in which (essentially) the candidate who won the most counties, not the most popular votes, would receive the nomination. Even then, Talmadge's opponent, James V. Carmichael, still polled well in rural counties, though not as well as in urban counties. Several witnesses stated that they overheard Talmadge speaking to George Hester, the brother of a white man stabbed by a black man named Roger Malcolm, outside of the courthouse in Monroe, Georgia, promising he would \"take care of the Negro\" in exchange for the Hester family using their influence to help win Walton County. On July 25, 1946, the car carrying Malcolm, who had been bailed out of jail, was stopped by a group of about 30 white men at Moore's Ford.  Malcolm, his wife Dorothy, and the other black couple riding in the car, George and Mae Murray Dorsey, were marched out of the car, lined up and shot. The FBI agent investigating the lynching called the allegation that Talmadge led the lynch mob  \"unbelievable\", but he forwarded the allegation to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover \"as it may be of some possible future interest.\" Talmadge's grandson, Herman Talmadge Jr, told the press: \"I don't think my grandfather's involved in any lynching. If y'all are that far off, I feel sorry for you.\" About the allegations that it was Talmadge who led the lynch mob at Moore's Ford, the historian Robert Pratt stated: \"I'm not surprised\u00a0... historians over the years have concluded the violently racist tone of his 1946 campaign may have been indirectly responsible for the violence that came at Moore's Ford. It's fair to say he's one of the most virulently racist governors the state has ever had.\" In 1946, Talmadge won Walton County by only 200 votes. Talmadge lost the popular vote in the Democratic primary to James V. Carmichael but won a majority of the \"county unit votes\". He died in December 1946, before he could be sworn in for his fourth term. The cause of death was hepatitis complicated with the effects of liver cirrhosis caused by his heavy drinking. Talmadge's coffin, while lying in state at the Georgia capital, was decorated with a wreath reading KKKK (Knights of the Ku Klux Klan), an organization that Talmadge had at least been friendly with. His  1946 death right before his inauguration precipitated the 1947 \"Three Governors Controversy\" among Arnall, Melvin E. Thompson, and Talmadge's son Herman. While the general assembly elected his son, Herman Talmadge to take his father's place, the newly elected lieutenant governor Melvin E. Thompson claimed his right to the governor's office, and also the outgoing governor Ellis Arnall refused to leave office. Following the court's decision, Herman Talmadge ceded the office of governor to Thompson, ending the controversy. This controversy damaged Georgia's national reputation."

In 1949, a statue honoring Talmadge was unveiled on the grounds of the Georgia State Capitol. The Talmadge Memorial Bridge (1953/1991) in Savannah, Georgia, is named after him. It connects downtown Savannah, Georgia with the Carolina Low Country via the Savannah River. In the early 21st century, renaming of the bridge has been suggested because of Talmadge's history as a white supremacist."

His father was a lawyer who gave up his practice due to ill health and studied music instead, while also officiating as priest at the village temple. Dhan Gopal describes his childhood and adolescence in the first part ('Caste') of his autobiography, Caste and Outcast (1923). Caste details Dhan Gopal's induction into the Brahminical tradition of his ancestors, and his experiences of wandering for a year as an ascetic, as was the custom for boys in strict priestly households. However, disillusioned with the traditional role and impatient of the backward-looking element in strict Hindu society, he left the ascetic life to study at the University of Calcutta. Here, in the circle of his brother Jadugopal Mukherjee's friends, he came in contact with the ideas of the Bengal resistance. Jadu Gopal was subsequently jailed without trial from 1923 to 1927. Dhan Gopal later wrote a memoir about Jadu Gopal, titled My Brother's Face."

His experiences among them, in San Francisco and New York, are detailed in 'Outcast', the second section of his autobiography. In 1910, he enrolled at University of California, Berkeley but transferred to Stanford University, where he eventually received his A.B. degree in Philosophy in 1914. In San Francisco Bay Area, he looked about for a way to support himself and pay for his college education, and soon lit upon writing. Around 1916 he wrote Sandhya, Songs of Twilight and Rajani or Songs of the Night, two books of poems, and Laila Majnu, a musical play in three acts, all published by Paul Elder and Company of San Francisco. He married Ethel Ray Dugan, an American artist and educator, and in 1918 they had a son, also called Dhan \"Dan\" Gopal Jr."

        "content": "In the 1920s, Mukerji moved to New York City and began his most prolific period of writing, published mainly by E.P. Dutton. Of his many children's books, Kari the Elephant was the first to see publication, in 1922, followed by Hari, the Jungle Lad two years later and Gay Neck, the Story of a Pigeon in 1927. Gay was the most successful; Mukerji won the 1928 Newbery Medal from the American Library Association recognising it as the year's best American children's book. The story features a carrier pigeon, Gay-Neck: his training and care in the flock owned by the narrator, his drafting as a messenger for the Indian army in France during World War I, and his return to India where he and his handler deal with the wounds and memories of war in the seclusion of a lamasery. One theme is \"man and winged animals as brothers\". Mukerji's other children's books include Ghond, the Hunter (1928), The Chief of the Herd (1929), Hindu Fables for Little Children (1929), Rama, the Hero of India (1930, produced for the children of Dalton School where his wife taught), The Master Monkey (1932), and Fierce-Face, the Story of a Tiger (1936). All these children's books were published by Dutton with professional illustrations, most in about 200 pages. Many of his works were reworkings of stories he had heard as a child. Others were inspired by his own experiences in India as a child among the jungles of Bengal, or as a yogi in various holy places. Among Mukerji's writings for adults are A Son of Mother India Answers (1928) (partly in response to Katherine Mayo's Mother India), Devotional Passages from the Hindu Bible and Visit India with Me (1929), Disillusioned India (1930) and My Brother's Face (1932). The Face of Silence (1926) is about the nineteenth-century saint and visionary Ramakrishna Paramhansa and is said to have deeply influenced Romain Rolland. The details of his later life are hazy, but there is some evidence to believe that relations with his wife entered a difficult phase at the end of his life. In spite of his many friends he felt deeply isolated and marginalised in America, as he could do very little, beyond raising funds and entertaining visiting celebrities, to further the cause of the Indian independence movement. The choices he had made in life prevented him from ever returning permanently to India, and it is possible to see his urge to write of the jungles and animals of his native land as a means of compensating for their absence. The unhappiness of his final years drove him further into spirituality, fuelled his interest in the spiritual heritage of his motherland and gave urgency to his desire to interpret and explain India to the West."

        "content": "On 14 July 1936, his wife discovered Mukerji had hanged himself his New York City apartment. No note was left. Dhan Gopal Mukerji is probably the first popular Indian writer in English. He pre-dates G.V. Desani and Mulk Raj Anand by some ten or twenty years. Krupabai Satthianadhan, the woman who wrote the novels Kamala and Saguna in the late nineteenth century, was certainly an accomplished writer, but her works did not reach a mass audience until she was rediscovered in the twentieth century. Scattered writings in English by Indians are encountered throughout the nineteenth century, such as the famous Rajmohan's Wife, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's first novel, written in English after the manner of Scott. There was also notable work by figures such as Roquia Sakhawat Hussain, writer of Sultana's Dream (1905), the first science fiction piece in English by an Indian, comparable to Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland. But usually these are byproducts of Indian language work, and Dhan Gopal Mukerji is the first to write seriously and consistently in English. This was not by choice, but was a product of his unfortunate situation. Dhan Gopal never lost the sense of mission which he shared with his brother, and throughout his life strove to complete the task he had set himself: to emancipate India from foreign rule and win for her culture and philosophy the respect he felt it deserved. In America he associated with fellow exiles like M.N. Roy, the founder of the Communist Party of India, to whom he is said to have suggested the adoption of the pseudonym 'Manabendra'. Forbidden the more satisfying outlet of activism, he poured his feelings into his writing. Consequently, his language is magical and persuasive, and his observation of animals and their ways is accurate and unsentimental. In his work the Gond hunter and the Brahmin child are equals in their travels in the jungle, and Dhan Gopal Mukerji never (unlike Kipling) anthropomorphises the animals or draws a facile moral from them. Although he was acutely conscious of his high caste, he saw it more as a responsibility than a privilege, and neither patronised nor denigrated the so-called lower castes and communities. He was, however, less sound on the subject of women. He writes movingly of child prostitutes in America in the 1910s and 1920s, especially of their plight during the Great Depression, but he also romanticises the life of Rangini, a 'tawaif' (courtesan) encountered in Caste and Outcast. He also praises his mother's and sisters' strict asceticism, all the more so since his mother is at that time a widow, performing all the hard penances prescribed to Hindu widows of her caste."

He pointed to the German Waldsterben (Forest dieback) hype of the 1980s: Research about the forest die back in Germany may serve as an example at the other end of the spectrum. The science of forest damages was in the 1980s heavily politicized, and used as support for a specific preconceived \"good\" policy of environmental protection. The resulting overselling and dramatization broke down in the 1990s, and news about adverse developments in German forests is now a hard sell in Germany. An observer wrote in 2004: \"The damage for the scientists is enormous. Nobody believes them any longer.\" Of course, the damage was not only limited to the forest researchers, but also to other environmental scientists and politicians as well. On 20 June 2013 Storch stated \"So far, no one has been able to provide a compelling answer to why climate change seems to be taking a break. We're facing a puzzle. Recent  emissions have actually risen even more steeply than we feared. As a result, according to most climate models, we should have seen temperatures rise by around 0.25 degrees Celsius (0.45 degrees Fahrenheit) over the past 10 years. That hasn't happened. In fact, the increase over the last 15 years was just 0.06 degrees Celsius (0.11 degrees Fahrenheit) -- a value very close to zero. This is a serious scientific problem that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will have to confront when it presents its next Assessment Report late next year.\""

Storch drafted and circulated an editorial on the new regime, reserving the right as editor-in-chief to reject articles proposed for acceptance by one of the editors. Following the publisher's refusal to publish the editorial unless all editors serving on the board endorsed the new policy, Storch resigned four days before he was due to take up his new position.

The test suggested that the method used in MBH98 would inherently underestimate large variations had they occurred; but this was subsequently challenged: see hockey stick graph for more detail. To reach this conclusion, Storch et al. used a climate model to generate a series of annual temperature maps for the world over the past several centuries. They then added white noise to the proxy data and  applied the methods used in MBH98, a variation of principal component analysis, to the computed temperature maps and found that the amount of variation was considerably reduced. In April 2006, Science published a comment authored by Wahl and collaborators, asserting errors in the 2004 paper, stating that \"their conclusion was based on incorrect implementation of the reconstruction procedure\" a mistake with Repercussions; and a disputing VS Reply. In this reply, VS and his team demonstrated that caveats raised in the Wahl comment did not invalidate their original conclusion. The inadequacy of the MBH98 methodology for climate reconstructions was later independently confirmed in other publications, for instance by Lee, Zwiers and Tsao, 2008 or by Christiansen et al., 2009. In 2010, Storch received the IMSC achievement award at the International Meetings on Statistical Climatology in Edinburgh, to \"recognize his key contributions to statistical downscaling, reconstruction of temperature series, analyses of climatic variability, and detection and attribution of climate change\"."

        "content": "Louis-Antoine de Noailles was born at the Ch\u00e2teau of Teyssi\u00e9re in Auvergne, France, on 27 May 1651 to Anne, 1st duc de Noailles and captain- general of Roussillon, and his wife, Louise Boyer, a former lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne of Austria. Noailles received his doctorate in theology from the Sorbonne on 14 March 1676.  He was appointed bishop of Cahors in March 1679 but served only briefly before Pope Innocent XI ordered him transferred in 1680 to head the diocese of Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne, which made him a peer of France.  On 19 August 1695, in recognition of Noailles's family connections, King Louis XIV made him archbishop of Paris and Duke of Saint-Cloud, and in 1700 Pope Innocent XII made him a cardinal. According to Antoine Degert, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia, although Noailles was not brilliant, \"he was possessed of piety, zeal, and activity.\" He is noted for having raised money to feed famine victims by selling his silver tableware in 1709, and for having spent a considerable part of his inheritance on redecorating Notre Dame. Noailles was a friend of Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon, with whom he had studied at the Coll\u00e8ge du Plessis before entering the Sorbonne.  Nonetheless, he was among the bishops who condemned F\u00e9nelon's Maximes des Saints, ending the theologian's career. Noailles came to know the controversial young Lutheran Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf in 1719 during the young man's Grand Tour.  The two found great spiritual connection despite their historic denominational differences.  They maintained a relationship and correspondence the rest of Noailles' life; and Noailles became a member of Zinzendorf's Order of the Grain of Mustard Seed, a secret society where nobles and church leaders committed to work together to build the spiritual Kingdom of God. The Cardinal also served as Godfather to Zinzendorf's son Christian Renatus (1727\u20131756). Noailles acted as a staunch moralist when at the end of March 1719 he firmly stood behind the cur\u00e9 of Saint-Sulpice. who refused to administer the sacraments to the Regent's daughter, Louise \u00c9lisabeth, Duchess of Berry, who was in a critical condition giving birth to an illegitimate child in the Palais de Luxembourg. Despite all the pleas of the Regent, Philip II, Duke of Orleans, Noailles refused categorically to overturn the decision of the parish priest. Noailles had a complex relationship with the Jansenists; while he condemned their propositions, more orthodox theologians saw in his own teachings hints of Jansenism, and Noailles was an opponent of the Jesuits in their attacks on the sect.  His position on Pope Clement XI's 1713 bull Unigenitus was also controversial; he opposed it, despite papal disapproval, up to 1728 but then abruptly reversed himself shortly before his death. He was succeeded as archbishop of Paris and Duke of Saint-Cloud by Charles-Gaspard-Guillaume de Vintimille du Luc."

This was a regiment in the Yeomanry, and it saw service in the Middle East, first in the Gallipoli Campaign and then Egypt. Butler next gained a position in the Directorate of Military Operations in the War Office and ended the war serving in the general staff of the British forces in France. His service led to him being appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and he was twice mentioned in despatches. At the end of the war Butler returned to Cambridge. In 1922 he stood as a member of parliament for Cambridge University. His greatest achievement during his short tenure in the House of Commons was the passage of the Oxford and Cambridge Universities Act 1922, which put into law the proposals of the Royal Commission established in 1919 to review the organisation and constitutions of the universities and the statutes of their colleges. He was defeated in the 1923 general election by his cousin Sir George Butler.  Promotion to tutor came in 1928, a lectureship in history in 1929 and then as senior tutor in 1931. Another world war intervened in his academic career. During the Second World War, Butler returned to military service in the Army Intelligence Corps, recruiting many former students including Bernard Willson to work on code breaking at Bletchley Park. From 1942 he worked in the field of civil affairs and military government, with particular focus on France. After the conclusion of hostilities, he was appointed editor United Kingdom Military Series of the History of the Second World War by the Prime Minister Clement Attlee. He was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History in 1947, holding the chair until 1954. He wrote two of the volumes concerning grand strategy published in that series. In 1958 he was given a knighthood for his work on the books. Butler resigned his chair in 1954 and was then appointed emeritus professor. The following year he was elected vice-master of Trinity College, a post he held until 1960."

In 1997, Jenness left Leo Burnett to become CEO of the retail consultancy Integrated Merchandising Systems in Chicago. He resigned as its CEO upon being named CEO at Kellogg. Although regarded by some as an outsider to Kellogg, Jenness has had a long association with the company. His first assignment at Leo Burnett in 1974 was an advertising campaign for the Special K brand of cereal. Since then, he worked on campaigns for most of Kellogg's brands. He was named to Kellogg's board of directors in July 2000."

        "content": "Thomas Joseph Odhiambo Mboya (15August 19305July 1969) was a Kenyan trade unionist, educator, Pan-Africanist, author, independence activist, and statesman. He was one of the founding fathers of the Republic of Kenya. He led the negotiations for independence at the Lancaster House Conferences and was instrumental in the formation of Kenya's independence party \u2013 the Kenya African National Union (KANU) \u2013 where he served as its first Secretary-General. He laid the foundation for Kenya's capitalist and mixed economy policies at the height of the Cold War and set up several of the country's key labour institutions. Mboya's intelligence, charm, leadership, and oratory skills won him admiration from all over the world. He gave speeches, participated in debates and interviews across the world in favour of Kenya's independence from British colonial rule.  He also spoke at several rallies in the goodwill of the civil rights movement in the United States. In 1958, at the age of 28, Mboya was elected Conference Chairman at the All-African Peoples' Conference convened by Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana. He helped build to the Trade Union Movement in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, as well as across Africa. He also  served as the Africa Representative to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). In 1959, Mboya called a conference in Lagos, Nigeria, to form the first All-Africa ICFTU labour organization. Mboya worked with both John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. to create educational opportunities for African students, an effort that resulted in the Kennedy Airlifts of the 1960s enabling East African students to study at American colleges. Notable beneficiaries of this airlift include Wangari Maathai and Barack Obama Sr.   In 1960, Mboya was the first Kenyan to be featured on the front page cover of Time magazine in a painting by Bernard Safran."

Mboya's father Leonard Ndiege was later promoted as an overseer at this sisal plantation and worked for 25 years. Eventually Leonard and Marcella had seven children, five sons and two daughters. When Mboya was 9 years old, his father sent him to a mission school in Kamba region."

In 1946, he attended the Holy Ghost College (later Mang'u High School), where he passed well enough to proceed to do his Cambridge School Certificate. In 1948, Mboya joined the Royal Sanitary Institute's Medical Training School for Sanitary Inspectors at Nairobi, qualifying as an inspector in 1950. He also enrolled in a certificate course in economics at Efficiency Correspondence College of South Africa. In 1955, he received a scholarship from Britain's Trades Union Congress to attend Ruskin College, University of Oxford, where he studied industrial management. After his graduation in 1956, he returned to Kenya and joined politics at a time when the British government was gaining control over the Kenya Land Freedom Army Mau Mau uprising."

        "title": "Tom Mboya_Political life",
        "content": "Mboya's political life started immediately after he was employed at Nairobi City Council as a sanitary inspector in 1950. During his stint at  Nairobi City Council, Mboya was elected as African Staff Association's president and immediately embarked on moulding the association into a trade union named the Kenya Local Government Workers' Union. This made his employer suspicious, but he resigned from his position before he could be laid off.  He was, however, able to continue working for the Kenya Labour Workers Union as secretary-general before embarking on his studies in Britain. In 1953, during the Mau Mau War for Independence, Jomo Kenyatta and other leaders of the independence party, Kenya African Union (KAU), were arrested. They asked Mboya to lead the KAU and continue the struggle. However, the government banned the KAU. Mboya then turned to use the trade unions as a platform to fight for independence. He was elected as Secretary General of the Kenya Federation of Labour (KFL), the umbrella body for trade unions in Kenya. In that role, Mboya gave speeches in London and Washington against British atrocities in Kenya. He also organized several strikes seeking better working conditions for African workers. At that point, the colonial government nearly closed down the labour movement in the effort to suppress his activities. Mboya reached out to other labour leaders across the world, more so in the ICFTU, including American A. Philip Randolph, with whom he was close. Mboya raised funds to build a headquarters for the KFL. In 1956, after Mboya had returned from the United Kingdom, the colonial government allowed black Africans to run for office and serve in the Legislative Assembly. Tom Mboya was elected from Nairobi. He was elected secretary of the African Caucus (called African Elected Members Organization \u2013 AEMO) and continued a campaign for independence, as well as seeking freedom for Jomo Kenyatta and other political prisoners. He used his incredible diplomacy skills to get support for the independence movement from foreign countries. In 1957, he became dissatisfied with the low number of African leaders (only eight out of fifty at the time) in the Legislative council and decided to form his party, the Nairobi People's Convention Party. At that time, Mboya developed a close relationship with Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana who, like Mboya, was a Pan-Africanist. In 1958, during the All-African Peoples' Conference in Ghana, convened by Kwame Nkrumah, Mboya was elected as the Conference Chairman at the age of 28. In 1959, Mboya along with the African-American Students Foundation in the United States organized the Airlift Africa project, through which 81 Kenyan students were flown to the U.S. to study at U.S. universities. Barack Obama's father, Barack Obama, Sr., was a friend of Mboya's and a fellow Luo who received a scholarship through the AASF and occasional grants for books and expenses.  Barack Obama, Sr. was not on the first airlift plane in 1959, because he was headed for Hawaii, not the continental US.  In 1960, the Kennedy Foundation agreed to underwrite the airlift, after Mboya visited Senator Jack Kennedy to ask for assistance, and Airlift Africa was extended to Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar (now Tanzania), Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and Nyasaland (now Malawi). Some 230 African students received scholarships to study at Class I accredited colleges in the United States in 1960, and hundreds more in 1961\u201363. In 1961, Jomo Kenyatta was released and, together with Oginga Odinga and Mboya's Nairobi People's Convention Party, joined with Kenya African Union and Kenya Independence Movement and formed the Kenya African National Union (KANU) in an attempt to form a party that would both transcend tribal politics and prepare for participation in the Lancaster House Conference (held at Lancaster House in London) where Kenya's constitutional framework and independence were to be negotiated. As Secretary General of KANU, Mboya headed the Kenyan delegation. Mboya also designed the flag for the new republic."

He created the National Social Security Fund, Kenya's social security scheme. He also established an Industrial Court to hear labour-management cases. When Kenya became a republic on 12 December 1964, the new President Kenyatta appointed Tom Mboya to the Economic Planning and Development Ministry and transferred all functions of his former Justice ministry to the office of Attorney General under Charles Mugane Njonjo. Together with his deputy then Mwai Kibaki,  he issued Sessional Paper 10, which defined Kenya's form of economic policies, when it was debated and passed by parliament in 1965. Mboya presented the Sessional Paper No. 10  for debate in parliament in April 1965 covering the period of 1964 \u2013 1970 under the title African Socialism and its Application to Planning in Kenya. Kenyatta and Mboya were known advocates of a non-aligned international policy, not wanting blanket application of capitalism while completely abhorring scientific socialism. In 1966,Tom Mboya was removed from the economic planning ministry and Kibaki was appointed for the first time as full Minister for Commerce and Industry. Mboya's development plans at the  Economic Planning Ministry were credited for Kenya's development rate of 7%, which was sustained during his tenure as the Planning Minister."

Nahashon Isaac Njenga Njoroge was convicted for the murder and later hanged. After his arrest, Njoroge asked: \"Why don't you go after the big man?\" Due to such statements, suspicions arose that Mboya's shooting was a political assassination. Outrage over his assassination led to riots in the major cities of Kenya. President Jomo Kenyatta gave a eulogy at Mboya's requiem mass, saying of his colleague, \"Kenya's independence would have been seriously compromised were it not for the courage and steadfastness of Tom Mboya.\" A statue of Mboya was installed on Moi Avenue, where he was killed, and the nearby busy Victoria Street was renamed Tom Mboya Street in his honour. Mboya left a wife and five children. He is buried in a mausoleum on Rusinga Island, which was built in 1970. Mboya's role in Kenya's politics and transformation is the subject of increasing interest, especially with the prominence of American politician Barack Obama. Obama's father, Barack Obama, Sr., was a US-educated Kenyan who benefited from Mboya's scholarship program in the 1960s, going on to get married during his stay there, siring the future Illinois Senator and President. Obama Sr. had seen Mboya shortly before the assassination and testified at the ensuing trial. Obama Sr. believed he was later targeted in a hit-and-run incident as a result of this testimony."

In his most well-known and controversial paper (The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime (2001), co-authored with John Donohue), he shows that the legalization of abortion in the US in 1973 was followed approximately eighteen years later by a considerable reduction in crime, then argues that unwanted children commit more crime than wanted children and that the legalization of abortion resulted in fewer unwanted children, and thus a reduction in crime as these children reached the age at which many criminals begin committing crimes."

        "content": "Revisiting a question first studied empirically in the 1960s, Donohue and Levitt argued that the legalization of abortion could account for almost half of the reduction in crime witnessed in the 1990s. This paper sparked much controversy, to which Levitt has said \". . . John Donohue and I estimate maybe that there are 5,000 or 10,000 fewer homicides because of it. But if you think that a fetus is like a person, then that\u2019s a horrible tradeoff. So ultimately I think our study is interesting because it helps us understand why crime has gone down. But in terms of policy towards abortion, you\u2019re really misguided if you use our study to base your opinion about what the right policy is towards abortion\" In 2003, Theodore Joyce argued that legalized abortion had little impact on crime, contradicting Donohue and Levitt's results. In 2004, the authors published a response, in which they claimed Joyce's argument was flawed due to omitted-variable bias. In November 2005, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston economist Christopher Foote and his research assistant Christopher Goetz, published a paper, in which they argued that the results in Donohue and Levitt's paper were due to statistical errors made by the authors. When the corrections were made, Foote and Goetz argued that abortion actually increased violent crime instead of decreasing it. In January 2006, Donohue and Levitt published a response, in which they admitted the errors in their original paper, but also pointed out that Foote and Goetz's correction was flawed due to heavy attenuation bias. The authors argued that, after making necessary changes to fix the original errors, the corrected link between abortion and crime was now weaker but still statistically significant. In 2019, Levitt and Donohue published a new paper to review the predictions of the original 2001 paper. The authors concluded that the original predictions held up with strong effects. \"We estimate that crime fell roughly 20% between 1997 and 2014 due to legalized abortion. The cumulative impact of legalized abortion on crime is roughly 45%, accounting for a very substantial portion of the roughly 50-55% overall decline from the peak of crime in the early 1990s.\" Levitt discusses this paper and the background and history of the original paper (including its criticisms) in an episode of the Freakonomics podcast."

Past studies had been inconclusive because of the simultaneity inherent in police hiring (when crime increases, more police are hired to combat crime). The findings of this paper were found to be the result of a programming error. This was pointed out in a comment by Justin McCrary published in the American Economic Review in 2002. In a response published with McCrary's comment Levitt admits to the error and then goes on to offer alternative evidence to support his original conclusions. Levitt's 1997 paper was also criticized in another comment that demonstrates the weakness of the instrumental variables used in the original study, rendering the interpretation difficult if not impossible."

It concludes that campaign spending has a very small impact on election outcomes, regardless of who does the spending. On the subject of federal spending and elections, previous empirical studies were not able to establish that members of Congress are rewarded by the electorate for bringing federal dollars to their district because of omitted variables bias.  Levitt and Snyder (1997) employ an instrument which circumvents this problem and finds evidence that federal spending benefits congressional incumbents; they find that an additional $100 per capita spending is worth as much as 2 percent of the popular vote. The 1996 paper on the median voter theorem develops a methodology for consistently estimating the relative weights in a senator's utility function and casts doubt on the median voter theorem, finding that the senator's own ideology is the primary determinant of roll-call voting patterns."

Str\u00f6mgren was born in 1870 in Helsingborg, in the Scania province of Sweden. He received his doctorate at Lund University in 1898, becoming docent there the same year. He worked at the University of Kiel from 1901, and assisted in the publication of Astronomische Nachrichten from 1901 to 1904. He became Professor of Astronomy and director of the Copenhagen Observatory of the University of Copenhagen in 1907. He died in Copenhagen in 1947. The minor planet 1422 Str\u00f6mgrenia was named in his honour. Str\u00f6mgren worked in a variety of fields but was particularly interested in theoretical astronomy and celestial mechanics, publishing works on the origin and orbits of comets. He also worked on the calculations for Jens Olsen's World Clock after 1928. His spouse, the dentist and writer Hedvig Lidforss (1877\u20131967), was daughter of the philologist Edvard Lidforss in Lund, and sister of the publicist and botanist Bengt Lidforss. Elis Str\u00f6mgren's sons were the astronomer Bengt Str\u00f6mgren, who succeeded his father in Copenhagen in 1940 and Erik Str\u00f6mgren notable danish psychiatrist."

        "content": "Boully's first book, The Body, sold out of its first printing  and was re-issued by Essay Press in 2007. A groundbreaking use of form, described by American poet and critic Arielle Greenberg as a \"text on absence, love, ontology and identity\u2014minus the text,\" the content of The Body is delivered only in footnotes, while the usual \"body\" of work is missing. Comparing it to Thalia Field's Point and Line, Greenberg praised The Body as \"an invigorating new approach to the idea of a text, of fiction, of essay, of poetry collection,\" signaling a \"courageous and thoughtful new voice in literature.\" [one love affair]*, Boully's second book, was nominated for five awards and won two (Best Book of New Poetry Published in 2006, and Best Second Book) from Coldfront Magazine. \"Through three sections rife with asterisks and superscript roman numerals,\" using  a mixture of fiction, essay, prose poetry, and memoir,  [one love affair]* \"challenges the ways in which we construct narratives and read texts,\"  as it \"wends a story of broken relationships, deploying everything from mimosa trees and spring to nightclubs and crack-smoke,\" and explores \" the way we learn to love and love again.\" Boully's third collection, The Book of Beginnings and Endings, \"consists of beginnings and endings of more than 30 different texts, spliced together seemingly at random. The subject matter ranges wildly: invertebrate zoology, probability, the psychology of a scream, the retirement of an ice cream man, a plague of frogs. Slowly, the reader notices thematic connections and the shadow of a narrative arc.\" As with Boully's previous collections, The Book of Beginnings and Endings accrues meaning and import through \"use of association, rather than spelled-out narrative.\" It \"resembles poetry. The texts themselves are essayistic, except that they are all fictional.\" A reviewer for the Los Angeles Times focused on another shared element in all of Boully's books--love, the affair of love, its beginning and it ending: \"Like Ana\u00efs Nin, Boully believes exclusively in love; it's her religion.\" On the relationship between this author and her readers, the reviewer added: It's uncommonly good to read the work of a writer who believes so unabashedly in the miracle of writing\u2014that some dimension, unlike any other, exists between the writer and the reader; that literature is an 'open system,' a 'living system.'\""

        "content": "Charles Eric Leiserson is a computer scientist, specializing in the theory of parallel computing and distributed computing, and particularly practical applications thereof. As part of this effort, he developed the Cilk multithreaded language.  He invented the fat-tree interconnection network, a hardware-universal interconnection network used in many supercomputers, including the Connection Machine CM5, for which he was network architect.  He helped pioneer the development of VLSI theory, including the retiming method of digital optimization with James B. Saxe and systolic arrays with H. T. Kung.  He conceived of the notion of cache-oblivious algorithms, which are algorithms that have no tuning parameters for cache size or cache-line length, but nevertheless use cache near-optimally.  He developed the Cilk language for multithreaded programming, which uses a provably good work-stealing algorithm for scheduling.  Leiserson coauthored the standard algorithms textbook Introduction to Algorithms together with Thomas H. Cormen, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. Leiserson received a B.S. degree in computer science and mathematics from Yale University in 1975 and a Ph.D. degree in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1981, where his advisors were Jon Bentley and H. T. Kung. He then joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is now a Professor.  In addition, he is a principal in the Theory of Computation research group in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and he was formerly Director of Research and Director of System Architecture for Akamai Technologies.  He was Founder and Chief Technology Officer of Cilk Arts, Inc., a start-up that developed Cilk technology for multicore computing applications.  (Cilk Arts, Inc. was acquired by Intel in 2009.) Leiserson's dissertation, Area-Efficient VLSI Computation, won the first ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award.  In 1985, the National Science Foundation awarded him a Presidential Young Investigator Award.  He is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).  He received the 2014 Taylor L. Booth Education Award from the IEEE Computer Society \"for worldwide computer science education impact through writing a best-selling algorithms textbook, and developing courses on algorithms and parallel programming.\"   He received the 2014 ACM-IEEE Computer Society Ken Kennedy Award for his \"enduring influence on parallel computing systems and their adoption into mainstream use through scholarly research and development.\"  He was also cited for \"distinguished mentoring of computer science leaders and students.\"  He received the 2013 ACM Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award for \"contributions to robust parallel and distributed computing.\""

        "content": "He was born on July 15, 1901, in Tullahoma, Tennessee, to a family of professional musicians. His grandfather, John Wesley Work, was a church choir director in Nashville, where he wrote and arranged music for his choirs. Some of his choristers were members of the original Fisk Jubilee Singers. His father, John Wesley Work, Jr., was a singer, folksong collector and professor of music, Latin, and history at Fisk, and his mother, Agnes Haynes Work, was a singer who helped train the Fisk group. His uncle, Frederick Jerome Work, also collected and arranged folksongs, and his brother, Julian, became a professional musician and composer. Work began his musical training at the Fisk University Laboratory School, moving on to the Fisk High School and then the university, where he received a B.A. degree in 1923. After graduation, he attended the Institute of Musical Art in New York City (now the Juilliard School of Music), where he studied with Gardner Lamson. He returned to Fisk and began teaching in 1927, spending summers in New York studying with Howard Talley and Samuel Gardner. In 1930 he received an M.A. degree from Columbia University with his thesis American Negro Songs and Spirituals. He was awarded two Julius Rosenwald Foundation Fellowships for the years 1931 to 1933 and, using these to take two years leave from Fisk, he obtained a B.Mus. degree from Yale University in 1933. Work spent the remainder of his career at Fisk, until his retirement in 1966. He served in a variety of positions, notably as a teacher, chairman of the Fisk University Department of Music, and director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers from 1947 until 1956. He published articles in professional journals and dictionaries over a span of more than thirty years. His best known articles were \"Plantation Meistersingers\" in The Musical Quarterly (Jan. 1940), and \"Changing Patterns in Negro Folksongs\" in the Journal of American Folklore (Oct. 1940). In 1953, he was a member of the charter class of the Zeta Rho chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity, the national fraternity for men in music. The Fisk chapter was the third chapter of the Fraternity chartered at a historically black college or university, the first being chartered at Howard University in 1952. Work began composing while still in high school and continued throughout his career, completing over one hundred compositions in a variety of musical forms\u2014for full orchestra, piano, chamber ensemble, violin and organ\u2014but his largest output was in choral and solo-voice music. He was awarded first prize in the 1946 competition of the Federation of American Composers for his cantata The Singers, and in 1947 he received an award from the National Association of Negro Musicians. In 1963 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Fisk University. Following Work's collection Negro Folk Songs, the bulk of which was recorded at Fort Valley, he and two colleagues from Fisk University, Charles S. Johnson, head of the department of sociology (later, in October 1946, chosen as the university's first black president), and Lewis Jones, professor of sociology, collaborated with the Archive of American Folk Song on the Library of Congress/Fisk University Mississippi Delta Collection (AFC 1941/002). This project was a two-year joint field study conducted by the Library of Congress and Fisk University during the summers of 1941 and 1942. The goal of the partnership was to carry out an intensive field study documenting the folk culture of a specific community of African Americans in the Mississippi Delta region. The rapidly urbanizing commercial area of Coahoma County, Mississippi, with its county seat in Clarksdale, became the geographical focus of the study. Some of the correspondence included in this collection between Work and Alan Lomax, then head of the Archive of American Folk Song, touches on both the Fort Valley and the emerging Fisk University recording projects. The legendary Muddy Waters was first recorded as part of this project. John Wesley Work died on May 17, 1967."

His research included studies on the transformation of pneumococci and on the biological variants of the streptococcus and other microorganisms.  Dawson's studies on the nature and treatment of arthritis made him a recognized authority in this disorder.  He was a pioneer in penicillin therapy, and was the first in the world to prepare it and use it in human disease. This included the successful treatment of bacterial endocarditis with penicillin, and the use of gold salts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Dawson became the first person in history to stick a needle full of an antibiotic (penicillin) into a patient, on October 16, 1940."

As a National Research Council fellow he worked with Oswald Avery at the Rockefeller Institute. Over Avery's strong objections, Dawson recreated Fred Griffith's discovery that a soluble substance from dead bacteria of one type can effect a repeatable and inheritable change in bacteria of another type - a process Dawson termed transformation in his six articles on the subject - in which he was the first person in history to put the substance to work in a test tube and even to partially extract it. The phrase stuck and eventually Avery along with Colin Munro MacLeod proved the substance was in fact DNA. In 1929 Dawson became associated with the Presbyterian Hospital and the Department of Medicine at Columbia University. In 1942 Dawson became the victim of myasthenia gravis, a chronic progressively disabling disease."

In the 1930s, he bought the Knoydart estate in Lochaber, Scotland, and became an infamous absentee landlord, opposing the rights of crofters and dismissing and evicting workers, preferring the estate for shooting and fishing. He eventually owned 13,000 acres (53\u00a0km2) in England and 62,000 in Scotland."

He became a committed member of the Anglo-German Fellowship, and his homes were used for entertaining supporters of Germany.  So identified was Brocket with the cause of Nazi Germany that he attended Hitler's 50th birthday celebration in 1939, and was a close friend of Joachim von Ribbentrop. According to Neville Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary, the Earl of Halifax used Brocket as a conduit to convey the views of the British government to the leading German Nazis. After the outbreak of World War II, Brocket continued to work for an understanding between Britain and Germany. He urged a negotiated peace settlement and tried to arrange talks with Hitler. He had a contact with Hermann G\u00f6ring through a Swedish intermediary called Bengt Berg. Brocket worked closely with the historian Arthur Bryant, who shared his views and helped bring the negotiations to the attention of the Foreign Office. However, Brocket was informed that the proposal to grant Germany control over Poland and Czechoslovakia was not acceptable to the British government."

He was educated at Edinburgh Academy then studied philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. He received his doctorate from Cambridge University in 1940. He then had a fellowship to St John's College, Cambridge in 1941, where he worked with Magdalen Dorothea Vernon and published papers with her about dark adaptation in 1941 and 1943. He was appointed to be the first director of the Medical Research Council's Cambridge-based Applied Psychology Unit in 1944. During the Second World War he served in the fire-fighting sections of the Civil Defence. Together with Gordon Butler Iles he made major advances on flight simulators for the RAF and did major studies on the effects of fatigue on pilots. He died at the age of 31 following an accident, where a car struck his bicycle on the Kings Parade in Cambridge on 7 May 1945. He died in hospital on the following day: VE Day. He is buried in the northern section of Dean Cemetery. His parents Marie Sylvia Craik and James Craik were later buried with him. The Kenneth Craik Club (an interdisciplinary seminar series in the fields of sensory science and neurobiology) and the Craik-Marshal Building in Cambridge are named in tribute to Craik.

Weibull came from a family that had strong ties to Scania. He was a cousin of the historian brothers Lauritz, Carl Gustaf and Curt Weibull. He joined the Swedish Coast Guard in 1905 as a midshipman. Weibull moved up the ranks with promotion to sublieutenant in 1907, Captain in 1916 and Major in 1940. While in the coast guard he took courses at the Royal Institute of Technology. In 1924 he graduated and became a full professor. Weibull obtained his doctorate from the University of Uppsala in 1932. He was employed in Swedish and German industry as a consulting engineer. In 1914, while on expeditions to the Mediterranean, the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean on the research ship Albatross, Weibull wrote his first paper on the propagation of explosive waves. He developed the technique of using explosive charges to determine the type of ocean bottom sediments and their thickness. The same technique is still used today in offshore oil exploration. In 1939 he published his paper on the Weibull distribution in probability theory and statistics. In 1941 he received a personal research professorship in Engineering Physics at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm from the arms producer Bofors. Weibull published many papers on strength of materials, fatigue, rupture in solids, bearings, and of course, the Weibull distribution, as well as one book on fatigue analysis in 1961. 27 of these papers were reports to the US Air Force at Wilbur Wright Field on Weibull analysis. In 1951 he presented his paper on the Weibull distribution to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), using seven case studies. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers awarded Weibull their gold medal in 1972. The Great Gold Medal from the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences was personally presented to him by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in 1978. Weibull died on 12 October 1979 in Annecy, France."

As such, he was responsible for four structural reforms: the creation of a retirement system based on private personal accounts (the AFP system), the opening of the private health and disability insurance system, the redesign of the labor code changing the terms of trade union elections, and the constitutional law on mining. Pi\u00f1era entered the cabinet in December 1978 when Chile faced two serious external threats: a possible war with Argentina over the disputed Beagle Islands and a trade boycott by the American AFL-CIO labor confederation. Pi\u00f1era quickly announced that Chile would soon promulgate a new trade union law reestablishing labor democracy in Chile (suspended since the coup d'\u00e9tat, September 11, 1973) and a new collective bargaining law.

        "content": "On November 4, 1980, Pi\u00f1era's Social Security Reforms were instituted via Decree Laws 3.500 and 3.501). These allowed workers to opt out of the government-run pension system and instead put the former payroll tax (10% of wages) in a privately managed Personal Retirement Account (PRA). New workers were automatically enrolled in the new system. These measures resulted in a privatization of Chile's social security system. This same Reform introduced two important changes to the health system: a) it fully privatized the disability insurance system, which became an integral part of the so-called \"AFP system\" (the AFPs are the private companies that manage the PRAs on workers' behalf); and, b) it allowed workers to opt out from the government health insurance system with all their mandatory contribution (another 7% of wages), as long as they were willing and able to buy with that money a minimum health insurance plan in what became the \"ISAPRE system\" (ISAPREs are private companies that offer diverse health insurance plans). The above-mentioned reform had a major impact on Chile's economy and society. By February 2011, 8.8 million individuals had a PRA. Because of movements in and out of the labor force, this number cannot be directly related to the current labor force of 7 million, out of a working-age population of 12.6 million. As regards ISAPREs, they counted for 1.2 million contributors in December 2010, who with their dependants provided health coverage to 2.7 million persons, representing about one-sixth of the total Chilean population of 16.5 million at that time. The proportion of persons covered by ISAPREs has been reducing since the mid-1990s, when it peaked at just over 25% of the population. The PRAs annual average rate of return since inception in May 1981 has been 9.27% a year, above inflation, according to the official statistics (for Fondo C) compiled by the Superintendency of Pensions (www.safp.cl). The resources accumulated in the workers accounts amount to $150 billion, or approximately 72% of Chile's GNP.  According to William Lewis, total government expenditures in Chile as a percentage of GDP declined from 34.3% in 1984 to 21.9% in 1990, and of that 12.4 points decline, social security and welfare changes accounted for half. Economist Paul Craig Roberts, who is known as the \"Father of Reaganomics\", has noted, that \"Chile was the first country in the world to privatize Social Security. Pi\u00f1era played the key role. Privatizing the pension system would have been enough to earn Pi\u00f1era his place in history, but he also oversaw the privatization of health care\". Some analysts and journalists have criticized the Chilean Pension system, pointing out, for example, that it did not require the self-employed to contribute or arguing that it imposed excessive administrative costs. From a different angle, a paper published by the Institute of Economic Affairs showed that the Chilean model had indeed some shortcomings. But surprisingly to some, it argued that these were a result of overregulation. A report submitted in 2006 by a bipartisan, government-appointed, Commission concluded that the system was working better than expected for the employed workers, that it was now technically possible and socially advisable to make the capitalisation system also compulsory for the self-employed, and that the fiscal savings arising from the transition process allowed for a strengthening and extension of the already existing safety net (consisting of a \"pension asistencial\" and a \"pension minima\", that will be combined into a \"pens\u00edon basica\")."

In August 1980, Pi\u00f1era signed the 1980 Constitution that established the transition path toward free elections in Chile. In April 1981, Pi\u00f1era, while Secretary of Mining, confronted General Pinochet in a cabinet meeting to prevent the leading trade union leader, Manuel Bustos, from being exiled. As a result, the order was rescinded. A year after Pi\u00f1era resigned his Ministry position in December 1981, Manuel Bustos was exiled to Rio de Janeiro. On December 2, 1981, the day after approval of the Mining Law, Pi\u00f1era resigned in order to restart his opinion magazine Economia y Sociedad, which was dedicated to fight for the transition to a democratic system and the consolidation of the free-market economy. In those years, still under the military regime, Pi\u00f1era wrote seventy articles  in the press in defense of human rights and democracy. In March 1990, after Chile's transition to democracy, he founded the \"Proyecto Chile 2010\". He described the goal as making Chile a developed country at its bicentenary. In 1992, in order to prove that the poor could understand free market solutions to their problems, he ran and was elected city councilman with the highest vote for one of Santiago's poorest neighborhoods, Conchal\u00ed. In 1993, in order to defend and explain to the population at large his free market reforms, he ran a testimonial presidential campaign as an independent. As a result, his legacy has been kept intact by the four Concertacion governments in the period 1990\u20132010. In December 2009, Pi\u00f1era shared a panel with the Polish trade union leader Lech Walesa in an International Conference in Zagreb dedicated to the theme of the prospects of democracy in Europe 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The conference was organized by Damian von Stauffenberg, member of the famed aristocratic family that opposed Hitler, and president of the Educational Initiative for Central and Eastern Europe (EICEE). Diario Financiero of Chile published this note  and Ian Vasquez, Director of Cato's Institute for Global Liberty, wrote  that both Pi\u00f1era and Lech Walesa \"have done so much to increase human freedom: Walesa for leading a workers' movement that played a key role in the collapse of Soviet communism; and Jos\u00e9 Pi\u00f1era for leading a revolution in private pensions that is turning workers into capitalists around the world.\""

In 1995, he became also the co-chair of the United States Cato Institute's Project on Social Security Choice. Since then he is said to have visited around 80 countries, 28 of which have implemented personal retirement accounts following the \"Pi\u00f1era model\". Unable to finance the transition toward a fully funded system, most of them combined it with their former state-run defined-benefit pension scheme. The President of the \"International Federation of Pension Fund Managers\" has commented: \"Towards the end of the year 2006, 28 countries (11 in Latin America, 12 in Central and Eastern Europe and five in other parts of the world) had already introduced mandated pension programs based on individual capitalization in their respective social security systems. A total of 100 million workers now have pension savings accounts in this type of program and have built up funds of over US$ 255 billions. Ukraine and Romania have already enacted reforms \u2013 to be implemented between 2008 and 2009 which include the introduction of mandated capitalization programs in their respective social security systems.\" In June 2007, the South African press published an article titled \"Applying passion to break poverty\" reporting on Pi\u00f1era's conferences in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. In May 2008, Richard Rahn, Chairman of the Institute for Global Economic Growth, wrote in The Washington Times: \"If you were asked to name one person who has enabled more people to gain wealth and security than any other person on the globe, who would you name? In 1881, here in Berlin, Otto von Bismarck started the world's first modern pay-as-you-go social security system which served as the model for the U.S. Social Security system and that of many other countries, including setting the retirement age at 65. No, Bismarck is not the answer to the opening question. The answer is Jose Pinera.\""

He was called up to the Dodgers late in the 1951 season but did not appear in a game. He was part of a September 27 game in which the entire Brooklyn bench was cleared from the dugout for arguing with the home plate umpire over a ruling at the plate. This has led to the legend that Sharman holds the distinction of being the only player in baseball history to have ever been ejected from a major league game without ever appearing in one. However, although Sharman was among the Dodger bench players that had to go to the clubhouse, none of them were actually barred from playing in the game. In fact, in the top of the ninth, one of the other dismissed players, Wayne Terwilliger, was used as a pinch-hitter in the game."

Sharman played a total of ten seasons for the Celtics, leading the team in scoring between the 1955\u201356 and 1958\u201359 seasons and averaging over 20 points per game during three of them. Sharman was one of the first NBA guards to shoot better than .400 from the field. He led the NBA in free throw percentage a record seven times (including a record five consecutive seasons), and his mark of 93.2% in the 1958\u201359 season remained the NBA record until Ernie DiGregorio topped it in 1976\u201377.  Sharman still holds the record for consecutive free throws in the playoffs with 56.  Sharman was named to the All-NBA First Team from 1956 through 1959, and was an All-NBA Second Team member in 1953, 1955, and 1960. Sharman played in eight NBA All-Star games, scoring in double figures in seven of them.  He was named the 1955 NBA All-Star Game MVP after scoring ten of his fifteen points in the fourth quarter.  Sharman still holds the NBA All-Star Game record for field goals attempted in a quarter with 12. Sharman ended his NBA playing career after 11 seasons in 1961."

He next went on to coach Los Angeles State (now California State, Los Angeles) for two seasons. In 1970\u201371 he coached the Utah Stars to an ABA title and was a co-recipient of the ABA Coach of the Year honors. After resigning as coach for the Utah Stars, Sharman signed a contract to coach the Los Angeles Lakers.  Controversy later ensued when the owner of the Utah Stars brought suit against Sharman for breach of contract stemming from his resignation, and a tort case against the owner of the Los Angeles Lakers for inducing such breach of contract.  Sharman was originally ordered to pay $250,000 in damages, but later appealed the trial court decision and reversed the judgement. The following season, he guided the Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West-led Los Angeles Lakers to an NBA record 33 game win streak, a then-record 69\u201313 win-loss mark, the first Lakers championship in Los Angeles and the first for the team in more than a decade.  That season, Sharman was named NBA Coach of the Year. He is one of two men to win NBA and ABA championships as a coach; coincidentally, the other, Alex Hannum, also coached a Chamberlain-led team (the 1967 Philadelphia 76ers) to an NBA championship. Sharman invented the morning shootaround as a way to burn off nervous energy on game days. He took the shootaround with him to his first coaching jobs in the ABL, the ABA, and later, the NBA.  After the Lakers won the championship in 1972, every other team in the league added the shootaround to its game-day regimen."

After his graduation, he worked as an investment banker with Goldman Sachs specialising in media and telecom. After a brief stint with the investment banking and securities firm, he returned to Pakistan in 2002. Until 2002, the electronic media in Pakistan was largely dominated by state-owned institutions like Pakistan Television Corporation and the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation. This monopoly was thwarted when the Musharraf regime regulated electronic media allowing for private television channels to be operated independently. It was during this liberalisation of the media in Pakistan that Rahman saw an opportunity to expand his family business. In 2002, he co-founded the privately owned television network, Geo TV. What started as a 5-member operation out of a hotel room turned into one of largest television broadcast networks in Pakistan. Geo TV was later recognised as a pertinent driver of change in the media landscape of the country. \"Geo has changed Pakistan's media landscape, consistently challenging the monopoly-and monotony of state-run Pakistan Television, or PTV.\" \"For the first time, analysts say, television in Pakistan is reflecting this predominantly Muslim country's diverse society and offering an independent source of news.\" Rahman has since served as the CEO of the television network that now employs more than 2,500 workers across the globe. In 2009, he joined the Harvard University John F Kennedy School of Government while pursuing his master's degree in public administration. He later had to take a sabbatical alongside his wife Sheena following her pregnancy. Sheena was also a fellow Harvard alumni pursuing her master's degree in education.

GEO's campaign, clarified the difference between man-made laws and divine law that the Hudood Ordinances was deliberately associated with. The campaign included testimony and unprecedented debate between the main liberal and conservative religious forces in the country and was credited to be the tipping point that led the Government to finally amend the ordinances. After much controversy and criticism from the Pakistani public, parts of the 1977 law were extensively revised in a 2006 amendment, called Women's Protection Bill by the Pakistani Parliament. Under Mir's supervision, GeoFilms launched its first films project titled Khuda Kay Liye (2007 film) which literally means 'In the Name of God' (2007 film) against whom a fatwa was issued by the terrorist leader of the Red Mosque, Islamabad. The project not only became Pakistani film industry's biggest blockbuster but also prompted much needed dialogue and discussion facing Islam and Pakistan today. GEO Network has been known to take on daring projects, including supporting the cause for justice, which created a tussle with the previous military and current civilian government. All of GEO's channels were shut down for almost 90 days, creating a net revenue loss of over $25 million. Most political analysts have been quoted to confirm GEO's role was unique in the country's historic independent judiciary movement and the eventual restoration of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. GEO took the daring lead to do stories on many important issues to not only educate the masses but also spread awareness on vital social issues like the polio vaccine, the MeToo Movement etc. GEO and Jang Group has tried to work for bigger causes that have a regional or global impact. The Group has worked on a project of peace between Pakistan and India in the past, working in collaboration with India's largest media group Times of India Group to launch a civilian peace initiative with India.

Early in his career, he became known for his research at Yale's Cowles Foundation in the first half of the 1960s on the sources of economic growth. His demonstration of the golden rule savings rate, a concept related to work by John von Neumann, started a wave of research on how much a nation should spend on present consumption rather than save and invest for future generations. Phelps was at the University of Pennsylvania from 1966 to 1971 and moved to Columbia University in 1971. His most seminal work inserted a microfoundation, one featuring imperfect information, incomplete knowledge and expectations about wages and prices, to support a macroeconomic theory of employment determination and price-wage dynamics. That led to his development of the natural rate of unemployment: its existence and the mechanism governing its size. In the early 2000s, he turned to the study of business innovation. He is the founding director, since 2001, of Columbia's Center on Capitalism and Society. He was McVickar Professor of Political Economy at Columbia from 1982 to 2021.

In 1951, he went to Amherst College for his undergraduate education. At his father's advice, Phelps enrolled in his first economics course in his second year at Amherst. Economist James Nelson gave the course, which was based on the famous textbook Economics by Paul Samuelson. Phelps was strongly impressed with the possibility of applying formal analysis to business. He quickly became aware of an important unsolved problem with the existing economic theory and the existing gap between microeconomics and macroeconomics. After receiving his B.A. at Amherst in 1955, Phelps went to Yale University for graduate studies. At Yale, he studied under future Nobel laureates James Tobin and Thomas Schelling, among others. Phelps was also strongly influenced by William Fellner whose course emphasized the expectations of agents. Phelps received his Ph.D. in Economics from Yale in 1959."

        "content": "After receiving his Ph.D., Phelps went to work as an economist for the RAND Corporation. However, feeling he could not pursue macroeconomics at RAND (which focused on defense work), Phelps decided to return to the academic world. In 1960, he took a research position at the Cowles Foundation while he was also teaching at Yale. At the Cowles Foundation, his research focused mainly on neoclassical growth theory, following the seminal work of Robert Solow. As part of his research, in 1961 Phelps published a famous paper on the Golden Rule savings rate, one of his major contributions to economic science. He also wrote papers dealing with other areas of economic theory, such as monetary economics or Ricardian equivalence and its relation to optimal growth. His position at Cowles gave Phelps the chance to interact with Arthur Okun and other notables in the field. He was able to collaborate with other top economists working on growth theory, including David Cass and fellow Nobelist Tjalling Koopmans. During the 1962\u201363 academic year, Phelps visited MIT, where he was in contact with future Nobel Prize winners Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow and Franco Modigliani. In 1966, Phelps left Yale and moved to the University of Pennsylvania to take up a tenured position as a professor of economics. At Penn, Phelps's research focused mainly on the link between employment, wage setting and inflation, leading to his influential 1968 paper \"Money-Wage Dynamics and Labor Market Equilibrium\" and others. The research contributed important insights in the microeconomics of the Phillips curve, including the role of expectations (in the form of adaptive expectations) and imperfect information in the setting of wages and prices. It also introduced the concept of the natural rate of unemployment and argued that labor market equilibrium is independent of the rate of inflation and so is no long run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation. That, if accurate, would have the crucial implication that the Keynesian policy of demand management has only transitory effects and so cannot be used to control the long-term rate of unemployment in the economy. In January 1969, Phelps organized a conference at Penn in support of the research on the microfoundations of inflation and employment determination. The conference papers were published the next year in a book that had a strong and lasting influence; it became known as the \"Phelps volume\". Along with his research on the Phillips curve, Phelps also collaborated with other economists on research regarding economic growth, the effects of monetary and fiscal policy, and optimal population growth. In the following years, an element in Phelps's foundations came under heavy criticism with the introduction of John Muth's rational expectations, which was popularized by future Nobel prize winner Robert Lucas, Jr. Phelps, with Calvo and John Taylor, started a program to rebuild Keynesian economics with rational expectations by employing sticky wages and prices. They did so by explicitly incorporating in models the fact that wage contracts are set in advance for multiple periods, an idea originating from Phelps's 1968 paper. This research lead to a paper published with Taylor in 1977, proving that staggered wage setting gives monetary policy a role in stabilizing economic fluctuations. The use of staggered wage and price setting, further developed by Calvo in a 1983 paper, became a cornerstone of New Keynesian economics. During the 1970s, Phelps and Calvo also collaborated on research on optimal contracts under asymmetric information. Phelps spent 1969\u201370 at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science at Stanford University. Discussions with fellow Nobel prize winners Amartya Sen and Kenneth Arrow and especially the influence of the philosophy of John Rawls, whom he met during the year at the Center, led Phelps to undertake some research outside macroeconomics. As a result, in 1972, he published seminal research in the new field that he named statistical discrimination. He also published research on economic justice, applying ideas from Rawls's A Theory of Justice. In 1971, Phelps moved to the Economics Department at Columbia University, which also included future Nobel prize winners William Vickrey and James J. Heckman (future laureate Robert Mundell joined three years later), as well as Phoebus Dhrymes, Guillermo Calvo and John B. Taylor. There, he published research on the inflation tax and the impact of fiscal policy on optimal inflation. In 1972, Phelps published a new book which focused on the derivation of policy implications of his new theory. The book further popularized his \"expectations-augmented Phillips curve\" and introduced the concept of hysteresis with regard to unemployment (prolonged unemployment is partially irreversible as workers lose skill and become demoralized). In the late 1970s, Phelps and one of his former students, Roman Frydman, conducted some research on the implications of assuming rational expectations, at first independently and then in collaboration. Their results suggested that rational expectations are not the correct way to model agents' expectations. They organized a conference on the issue in 1981 and published the proceedings in a 1983 book. However, as rational expectations were becoming the standard in macroeconomics, the book was initially received with hostility and was largely ignored. The financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, along with the failure of rational expectations models to predict it, led to a renewed interest in the work."

In the 1980, Phelps increased collaboration with European universities and institutions, including Banca d'Italia (where he spent most of his 1985\u201386 sabbatical and Observatoire fran\u00e7ais des conjectures \u00e9conomiques (OFCE). He became interested in the puzzle of the persistent high unemployment in Europe despite no pause in inflation and published on the subject with Jean-Paul Fitoussi (the director of OFCE). Further study led Phelps to believe that it is not a transitory phenomenon but the effect of changes in equilibrium unemployment. During the following years, Phelps tried to build a theory to determine endogenously the natural rate of unemployment. He published partial research results in a 1994 book, Structural Slumps: The Modern Equilibrium Theory of Employment, Interest and Assets. Phelps also collaborated closely with Luigi Paganetto at the University of Rome Tor Vergata and, between 1988 and 1998, as co-organizers of the Villa Mondragone International Seminar."

        "content": "In 1990 Phelps took part in a mission from the new EBRD to Moscow, where he and Kenneth Arrow designed a proposal for the reform of the Soviet Union. After the EBRD was established, he became a member of its Economic Advisory Board, where he stayed until 1993. From his work at EBRD and collaboration with his former student, Roman Frydman, Phelps developed a strong interest in Eastern Europe's transition economies. Over the late 1980s and the early 1990s, Phelps created a new non-monetary theory of employment in which business asset values drive the natural rate. The theory, first fully set out in his book Structural Slumps (1994), explains Europe's slump without disinflation in the 1980s: the elevation of the world real rate of interest, declining opportunities for continuing technological catching up and the mushrooming social wealth granted by Europe's emerging welfare state play the main causal roles. Two sequel papers in 2000 and 2001 on the theory of 'structural booms' explained US inflationless expansion in the late 1990s and claimed its transience. His papers develop the thesis that the great economic swings experienced by the West in the past century not only originate in non-monetary shocks but also operate fundamentally by non-monetary mechanisms. This book, as well as subsequent papers, argued that the fluctuation of unemployment rates in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France stemmed from the accumulation of wealth with minimal investment. In the mid-1990s, his research turned to what he called economic inclusion. He published in 1997 a book for the general public, Rewarding Work about the causes and cures of the joblessness and low wages among disadvantaged workers."

        "content": "Phelps's current work is about the benefits and sources of a country's structural dynamism: the enterprise and creativity of entrepreneurs, the skill of financiers in selecting and supporting the best projects, and the knowledge managers draw upon in evaluating and making use of new methods and products. Every dynamic economy has its doldrums and even torpid economies may rise, perhaps with delay, to an extraordinary opportunity. However, great dynamism, he argues, brings advantages in virtually every dimension of economic performance, not just in productivity. For Phelps, the challenges presented in a creative and evolving business sector provide most people with their main vehicle for the exploration, exercise, and development of their talents. In the already-advanced economies, that is perhaps the best reason that policy must aim to build a business sector of high dynamism and broad inclusion. The research task is to identify the institutions that are pathways to dynamism and the institutions that are obstructions. Phelps's own research on dynamism began at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 1990 and 1992\u201393, where he worked on the theory of capitalism and issues of mass privatization in Eastern Europe. Later in the decade, he turned to studying a range of economic institutions in Western Europe and the United States. He conducted research with a focus on the Italian economy as Senior Advisor to Italy in Europe of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche from 1997 to 2000. In 2001, he and Roman Frydman founded the Center on Capitalism & Society at Columbia (now a unit of Arts and Sciences) to promote and conduct research on capitalism. In 2008, writing in the wake of the Great Recession, Phelps criticized the \"false\" models of neoclassical economics, but he also wrote with skepticism regarding Keynesian resurgence: What theory can we use to get us out of the impending slump quickly and reliably? To use the 'new classical' theory of fluctuations begun at Chicago in the 1970s \u2013 the theory in which the \"risk management\" models are embedded \u2013 is unthinkable, since it is precisely the theory falsified by the asset price collapse. The thoughts of some have turned to John Maynard Keynes. His insights into uncertainty and speculation were deep. Yet his employment theory was problematic and the 'Keynesian' policy solutions are questionable at best....At the end of his life Keynes wrote of 'modernist stuff, gone wrong and turned sour and silly'. He told his friend Friedrich Hayek he intended to re-examine his theory in his next book. He would have moved on. The admiration we all have for Keynes's fabulous contributions should not sway us from moving on. Since around 2006, his main research focus has been innovation and economic growth as fueled by the creativity of ordinary people within a nation. His book  book Mass Flourishing (2013) remarks that cavemen had the ability to imagine new things and the zeal to create them, but a culture liberating and inspiring dynamism is necessary to ignite what Lincoln called a \u201cpassion for the new.\u201d These thesis on the central role of values for indigenous innovation and the good life are tested in the book Dynamism, coauthored with Raicho Bojilov, Hian Teck Hoon and Gylfi Zoega, which was published by Harvard University Press in 2020. Phelps severely criticizes the economic policy of U.S. president Donald Trump. It feels \"like economic policy at a time of fascism [...]. The leader controls the economy and tells the companies how things are going to be done.\" In June 2020, he and other Nobel laureates in Economics, as well as architects, chefs and leaders of international organizations, signed the International Appeal of 7 June 2020in favour of the purple economy (\u201cTowards a cultural renaissance of the economy\u201d), published in Corriere della Sera, El Pa\u00eds and Le Monde."

Beginning in the late 1970s, he had worked with hundreds of high schools, studying the development and design of the American educational system, leading to his major work Horace's Compromise in 1984.

        "content": "Sizer was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of Caroline Wheelright (Foster) and Theodore Sizer, Sr. (1892\u20131967), an art history professor at Yale University. He received his B.A. in English from Yale in 1953 and subsequently served in the Army as an artillery officer. He later described his experience leading soldiers in a democratic and egalitarian fashion as a formative influence on his ideas about education. After  teaching in high schools, he earned his masters and doctorate in education from Harvard University in 1957 and 1961, respectively.  He was a faculty member and later dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, a position he held during the 1969 Harvard student strike. While dean, he reorganized the school into seven departments, expanding the resources available for research (particularly in the area of urban education), while expanding minority enrollment. In 1970, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship  for Education. Sizer left Harvard to serve as headmaster of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts from 1972 to 1981, to lead a study of American high schools sponsored by the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the National Association of Independent Schools. From 1983 to 1997, he worked at Brown University as a professor and chair of the education department, and in 1993, he became the Founding Director of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform. During his years at Brown, he produced most of his books, including Horace's Compromise. In it, he examined the fundamental compromise at the heart of allegedly successful American high schools. He suggested that the students agree to generally behave in exchange for the schools agreeing not to push them too hard or challenge them too severely. Thus, he widened the scope of schools that were failing to do their best to educate children far beyond the traditionally criticized poor and urban schools and challenged the conceptions of what could be considered a successful school. The ideas explored in his Horace Trilogy supply much of the foundation of the Coalition of Essential Schools. Theodore frequently collaborated with his spouse and fellow educator Nancy Faust Sizer. After Brown University, the couple took a one-year position during the 1998\u201399 school year as co-principals of the Francis W. Parker Charter Essential School, which Ted helped found and served as a Trustee. Deborah Meier joined the couple in authoring Keeping School, based on the Parker experience. From 1997 through 2006, Sizer returned to the Harvard Graduate School of Education as a visiting professor. He and Nancy co-taught a course on redesigning the American secondary school, while he continued to work on the issues of integrating the multiple services that low socio-economic status families need in poor communities. Sizer was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. Theodore and Nancy Faust wed in 1955 and had four children together. He died at age 77 on October 21, 2009 at his home in Harvard, Massachusetts due to colon cancer."

His father was killed, and Ejiofor was badly injured, receiving scars that are still visible on his forehead. Ejiofor began acting in school plays at his junior school, Dulwich Prep London (known at the time as 'Dulwich College Preparatory School'), where he played the gravedigger in William Shakespeare's Hamlet. He continued acting at his senior school, Dulwich College and joined the National Youth Theatre. He got into the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art but left after his first year, after being cast in Steven Spielberg's film Amistad.

In Steven Spielberg's Amistad, he gave support to Djimon Hounsou's Cinque as interpreter Ensign James Covey. In 1999, he appeared in the British film G:MT \u2013 Greenwich Mean Time. In 2000, he starred in Blue/Orange at the Royal National Theatre (Cottesloe stage), and later at the Duchess Theatre. That same year, his performance as Romeo in William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet was nominated for the Ian Charleson Award. Ejiofor was awarded the Jack Tinker Award for Most Promising Newcomer at the Critics' Circle Theatre Awards in 2000. For his performance in Blue/Orange, Ejiofor received the London Evening Standard Theatre Award for Outstanding Newcomer in 2000 and a nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2001. Ejiofor had his first leading film role playing Nicky Burkett in Jeremy Cameron's It Was an Accident (2000). In 2002, he starred in Dirty Pretty Things, for which he won a British Independent Film Award for best actor. In the following year, he was part of the ensemble cast of Love Actually, starred in a BBC adaptation of Chaucer's The Knight's Tale and also starred on the BBC series Trust. Also in 2003, he starred in the lead role of Augustus in the radio production of Rita Dove's poetic drama \"The Darker Face of the Earth\", which premiered on the BBC World Service on 23 August of that year, marking the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. He starred alongside Hilary Swank in Red Dust (2004), portraying the fictional politician Alex Mpondo of post-apartheid South Africa. He played the central role of Prince Alamayou in Peter Spafford's radio play I Was a Stranger, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 17 May 2004, and he played the god Dionysus, alongside Paul Scofield's Cadmus and Diana Rigg's Agave, in Andrew Rissik's play, Dionysus, based upon Euripides' Bacchae, also broadcast by the BBC. He also received acclaim for his performance as a complex antagonist The Operative in the film Serenity (2005). Ejiofor played a revolutionary in the film Children of Men (2006). His singing and acting performance in Kinky Boots received a Golden Globe Award and British Independent Film Award nomination. He was also nominated for the BAFTA Orange Rising Star Award in 2006, which recognises emerging British film talent. Ejiofor's performance in Tsunami: The Aftermath received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor \u2013 Miniseries or Television Film in 2007. In 2007, Ejiofor starred opposite Don Cheadle in Talk to Me, a film based on the true story of Ralph \"Petey\" Greene (played by Cheadle), an African-American radio personality in the 1960s and 1970s. He performed on stage in The Seagull at the Royal Court Theatre from 18 January to 17 March 2007, then later that year reprised his role as Othello at the Donmar Warehouse, alongside Kelly Reilly as Desdemona and Ewan McGregor as Iago. The production received favourable reviews, with particularly strong praise for Ejiofor. \"Chiwetel Ejiofor produces one of the most memorable performances of Othello in recent years\". He was awarded the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor for his performance. He also narrated the BBC television film Partition: The Day India Burned (2007), which was based on the Partition of India. He starred as Mike Terry in the 2008 cult film Redbelt that received favourable reviews. Ejiofor was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours. In the same year, he made his directorial debut in the short film Slapper, which he also wrote, based on an idea by editor/director Yusuf Pirhasan. Ejiofor appeared alongside John Cusack in the film 2012 (2009). The film went on to gross over $700 million, and is among the list of highest-grossing films of all time and placing 5th of top films of 2009. He played CIA officer Darryl Peabody in Salt (2010), and the Golden Globe Award-nominated leading role of band creator Louis Lester on the BBC Two drama series Dancing on the Edge (2013), which played on Starz in the United States. In 2013, Ejiofor took on the role of Solomon Northup in 12 Years a Slave. The film was based on Northup's memoir, edited in 1968 by historians Sue Eakin and Joseph Logsdon, of Northup's experience as a free black man in New York, who was kidnapped in 1841 and sold into slavery in Louisiana. On casting, director Steve McQueen said:Chiwetel Ejiofor was always going to be Solomon Northup for me. I was looking for someone that had that genteelness, that kind of humanity. Knowing that humanity was going to be tested under certain duress and circumstances, I needed a person who could actually keep hold of that, even through periods of extraordinary trying and extraordinary situations where it would be tested to its absolute limit. He was the only person.At the Toronto International Film Festival, Ejiofor said he briefly hesitated about playing Northup. \"You wait all your life for a great script to come through the door. You're hassling your agent and all that, and then it comes and you read it and your first reaction surprises you. Your first reaction being, 'Can I do this?'\" He accepted the role about 24 hours later. As part of his preparation, Ejiofor learned to play the violin, collected slave stories, maintained a slave's edge up hairstyle, and engaged in some of the physical labour that Northup did like picking cotton. Since he had not worked with McQueen before, Ejiofor also observed the working dynamic between the director and co-star Michael Fassbender, who worked with McQueen on Hunger (2008) and Shame (2011). On playing Northup, Ejiofor did feel a responsibility, not being American, to get the story of Solomon Northup as current he could, adding \"I've been very grateful to show the film to his descendants and see them be so proud of it.\" 12 Years a Slave opened to wide acclaim, with many critics citing Ejiofor's performance and declaring him an almost-certain Academy Award nominee for Best Actor. From Owen Gleiberman at Entertainment Weekly: \"It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence.\" From Christopher Orr at The Atlantic: \"Ejiofor has given notable performances in the past (Dirty Pretty Things, Serenity, Talk to Me), but this is by far his most essential role to date. Stoic, watchful, compromising himself just enough to stay alive, he is the point of stillness and decency around which spin the madnesses of the film.\" In his The Hollywood Reporter review, Todd McCarthy wrote, \"Ejiofor is terrific in a demanding character who's put through the wringer physically, mentally and emotionally.\" On 16 January 2014, Ejiofor was officially nominated for Best Actor for the 86th Academy Awards on 2 March. As of September 2013, Ejiofor was slated to portray Patrice Lumumba in a film adaptation of Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire's A Season in the Congo, a role in which he had performed on stage at the Young Vic. Joe Wright, who directed the play, was to also direct the film. In 2014, Ejiofor starred in the Nigerian film Half of a Yellow Sun alongside Thandiwe Newton. It was announced in June 2014 that Ejiofor would play real-life drug dealer Thomas McFadden in film based on the book Marching Powder: A True Story of Friendship, Cocaine, and South America's Strangest Jail, written by McFadden and Australian journalist Rusty Young. In 2016, Ejiofor co-starred with his friend Benedict Cumberbatch and played Baron Mordo in the Marvel film Doctor Strange. That same year, it was announced that he would play Peter in the upcoming film Mary Magdalene, written by Helen Edmundson and directed by Garth Davis. On 1 November 2017, he was officially chosen for the role of Scar for the computer animated remake, The Lion King (2019) directed by Jon Favreau. Played by Jeremy Irons in the 1994 animated film, Ejiofor described Scar as more \"psychologically possessed\" and \"brutalized\" than in the original. Ejiofor stated, \"especially with Scar, whether it's a vocal quality that allows for a certain confidence or a certain aggression, to always know that at the end of it you're playing somebody who has the capacity to turn everything on its head in a split second with outrageous acts of violence \u2013 that can completely change the temperature of a scene.\" He also said that \"[Scar and Mufasa's] relationship is completely destroyed and brutalized by Scar's way of thinking. He's possessed with this disease of his own ego and his own want.\" Favreau said of casting Ejiofor, \"[He] is just a fantastic actor, who brings us a bit of the mid-Atlantic cadence and a new take on the character. He brings that feeling of a Shakespearean villain to bear because of his background as an actor. It's wonderful when you have somebody as experienced and seasoned as Chiwetel; he just breathes such wonderful life into this character.\" Ejiofor narrated the 2019 documentary film The Elephant Queen. In 2019, Ejiofor made his feature directorial debut with The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, adapted from the memoir of the same name from William Kamkwamba, about a boy who built a wind-powered water pump in Malawi."

She, along with fellow students of National Taiwan University Bai Xianyong, Wang Wenxing, and Chen Rouxi, created the literary magazine Modern Literature (Xiandai wenxue) in 1960, under the guidance of Professor Hsia Tsi-an. She attended graduate school in the United States. Ouyang's short stories are modernist in the sense that they employ novelistic techniques of literary modernism: stream of consciousness, multiple perspective narration, symbolism, probing of psychological depths instead of drawing social canvases.  Such techniques flourished briefly in Taiwan during the 1960s and were in response to the socio-political \"Recover the Mainland\" trend of the 1940s and 1950s. Ouyang's writing is experimental as well in terms of challenging social mores, especially concerning sex. Her stories are filled with violence, sexuality and abnormal psychology. In terms of literary merit, her writing is easily digestible, soap-operatic, and melodramatic. Ouyang is also a noted literary critic. She has produced a book-length study of Taipei People (see Pai Hsien-yung)."

        "content": "Skottsberg was born in Karlshamn on 1 December 1880 the son of Carl Adolf Skottsberg a schoolmaster and his wife, Maria Louisa Pfeiffer. He was educated locally then studied Sciences at Uppsala University from 1898, specialising in Botany, and receiving his doctorate (PhD) there in 1907. From 1901 to 1903 Skottsberg served as official botanist to the Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1901 to 1903 on the ship Antarctic. On his return to Sweden, Skottsberg published (1905) the first comprehensive phytogeographic study of the flora of southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. Later he led the Swedish Magellanic Expedition to Patagonia, 1907 to 1909. Carl Skottsberg is believed to have been the last to have seen the Santalum fernandezianum tree alive when he visited the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands in 1908. He was conservator at the Uppsala University Botanical Museum 1909 to 1914, but led the work on the new Botanical Garden in Gothenburg from 1915, and was appointed professor and director of the garden there, G\u00f6teborg Botanical Garden, in 1919. Skottsberg was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and several other Swedish learned societies, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1950. That same year he presided the 7th International Botanical Congress. He was awarded the Linnean Society of London's Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1958 and the Linnean Medal in 1959. He is buried at \u00d6stra kyrkog\u00e5rden in Gothenburg."

        "content": "Salisbury served as a physician during the American Civil War, and became convinced that diarrhea suffered by the troops could be controlled with a diet of coffee and lean chopped beefsteak. Salisbury was one of the earliest health food faddists and taught that diet was the main determinant of health. He believed vegetables and starchy foods produced poisonous substances in the digestive system which were responsible for heart disease, tumors, mental illness and tuberculosis. He believed that human dentition demonstrated that humans were meant to eat meat, and sought to limit vegetables, fruit, starches, and fats to one-third of the diet. The Salisbury steak, his means of achieving this goal, is ground beef flavored with onion and seasoning and then broiled and covered with gravy or brown sauce. It was introduced in 1888. Salisbury saw beef as an excellent defense against many different physical problems. He suggested that Salisbury steak should be eaten three times a day, with much hot water to cleanse the digestive system. He was an early American proponent of a low-carbohydrate diet for weight loss, and he promoted his diet for that purpose. His diet became known as the \"Salisbury diet\". It has been described as an early example of a fad diet. The Salisbury diet was promoted by Elma Stuart in her book What Must I do to Get Well?, that went through at least 32 editions. Salisbury steak is similar to a number of other dishes made of ground beef. Its name caught on partly because World War I inspired a movement in English-speaking nations to avoid German-sounding terms such as \"hamburger\"."

The programme started in 1937 as \"Monday Night at Seven\", becoming \"Monday Night at Eight\" soon after the outbreak of the Second World War.

        "content": "Glass became the interim CEO and chairman of the Royals on September 23, 1993, following the death of his longtime friend, Royals founder Ewing Kauffman. Under Glass' leadership, the board cut the payroll from $41\u00a0million to $19\u00a0million. During the Major League Baseball strike of 1994\u20131995, Glass opposed any settlement with the players' union without a salary cap, and supported the use of strike-breaking \"replacement\" players, despite a court ruling that the use of replacement players violated federal labor law. On April 18, 2000, Glass became sole owner of the Royals, purchasing the organization from the Kauffman estate for $96\u00a0million. The Royals board approved his offer despite a competing bid of $120\u00a0million by Miles Prentice. However, MLB rejected Prentice's offer because he did not have enough net worth to withstand substantial losses. None of Kansas City's wealthy families were willing to even consider making a bid for the Royals\u2014or any other existing or prospective professional team in Kansas City. This left Glass was the only credible bidder who had the financial wherewithal to buy the team and keep it in Kansas City. An original stipulation of the sale was that any profits from Glass' sale of the Royals must go to charity, but that clause expired long before Glass sold the team. For much of his tenure as owner, Glass was criticized for bringing the same cost-cutting management style he used at Walmart to the Royals. Shortly after assuming sole ownership of the franchise Glass appointed his wife and their three children to the board and important senior management roles with the organization, despite the fact that none of them had any meaningful background in baseball. While his cost-conscious managerial style ensured large profits, the Royals were barely competitive for most of the early part of the new millennium. Glass' management is cited for transforming the Royals from a perennial playoff contender in the 1970s and 1980s to one of the worst teams in Major League Baseball during the 1990s and early 2000s. Glass created a controversy on June 9, 2006, by revoking the press credentials of two reporters who had earlier asked pointed questions to Royals management. The move to avoid criticism infuriated many within the press and led to a backlash of articles that extended far beyond the Kansas City sports community. The Royals had four winning seasons during his ownership: 2003, 2013, 2014 and 2015. In 2014, the Royals won 89 games and reached the 2014 Major League Baseball Playoffs for the first time in 29 years. They advanced to the World Series for the first time since 1985. The Royals finished the following year with the best regular-season record in the American League, and a second consecutive victory in its championship series. The Royals then defeated the New York Mets in 5 games to win its first World Series championship since 1985. In August 2019, Glass agreed to sell the team to Cleveland Indians vice chairman John Sherman, pending approval from Major League Baseball and its remaining owners. In November 2019, Glass officially sold the team to Sherman."

On 3 May 1974 Noble was elevated to the peerage as Baron Glenkinglas, of Cairndow in the County of Argyll. Although he was a good 25 years younger than the architectural historian Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel, the two had a very friendly feud. Noble is said to have joked that they were \"best of enemies.\" He died in May 1984, aged 71."

Initially, the government proposed that Grushevoy\u2019s organisation become a part of the state relief program but the organisation refused the offer. For several months, the KGB officials simply sat in the fund\u2019s offices and carried out audits (especially of its links with German organisations, where many children were sent for the summer months for recreation) while monitoring all facets of business. Ultimately, the fund was evicted from the building and forced to operate, under a different name, out of a hotel room. Some of its leaders moved to Germany, with the help of partner organisations. After organising demonstrations in Minsk to mark the 11th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, arrest orders were issued for Grushevoy and his wife Irina. The official reason given by the authorities was fraud. The couple spent a year in exile in Germany before returning to Belarus when the charges were dropped - since no evidence of fraud could be found among the papers of the fund."

She was re-elected to Congress with 80% of the vote against a little-known Republican opponent on November 4, 1980, but it soon became clear that she would be comatose for the remaining years of her life. In the first weeks of the 97th Congress, the House passed a resolution providing for Spellman's pay as if she had been seated, and for her Congressional office to be supported as if a member of Congress had died or resigned. When it became clear she was permanently incapacitated and unlikely to recover, the House passed an act declaring the 5th District seat vacant.

It is the only time that medical reasons have resulted in the House of Representatives declaring a seat vacant.

        "content": "Moritsugu's films are often defined by their \"lo-fi\" aesthetic and were initially shot on 16mm film for a gritty, visceral quality. He states that he often \"pay(s) less attention to narrative flow and storyline and put(s) more emphasis on sight, sound and spectacle\" to create a movie that is \"like a live punk/hardcore show.\" The works themselves are often absurdist comedies that feature actress, co-writer, stylist, and wife, Amy Davis. Perhaps best known for his cult film Mod Fuck Explosion, Moritsugu's films have been screened at Sundance, Cannes, Berlin, Toronto, Rotterdam, Venice, New York Underground, Chicago Underground, MoMA, Guggenheim, Whitney and numerous other festivals and museums. In 2001 he received the Moving Image award from Creative Capital."

        "content": "Moritsugu started filmmaking in high school in the early 1980s and then attended Brown University, where he studied semiotics and critical theory. Classmates in his department included director Todd Haynes, producer Christine Vachon and studio head-producer Nina Jacobson. Moritsugu's senior thesis film, Der Elvis, was called by The Village Voice critic J. Hoberman \"one of the top 50 films of the eighties.\" The New York Times described it as \"a 23-minute jolt of highly controlled chaos.\" Upon graduating in 1987, he commenced production on his first feature, My Degeneration, but an industrial accident in which his right arm was pulled into a conveyor belt and nearly severed postponed the project. After a lengthy hospital stay and rehabilitation, he was able to restart the movie, which he looked at as a form of \"physical therapy.\" My Degeneration, about an all-girl rock band playing music for the beef industry, starred his future wife Amy Davis. It played at a number of film festivals including Sundance, where Roger Ebert walked out after 7 minutes. Rolling Stone named it one of the \"25 Greatest Punk Rock Movies of All Time\" and said: \"Underground filmmaker/art terrorist Jon Moritsugu reimagines a rise-and-fall showbiz narrative as a scuzzy, 16mm skullfuck opus set in a lo-fi punk world...This movie feels like punk rock: dirty, angry, righteous, handmade, exhilirating.\" The movie was self-released theatrically, after which Moritsugu moved to the West Coast in 1990."

        "content": "Settling in San Francisco, Moritsugu completed Hippy Porn in 1991, a 16\u00a0mm black-and-white feature which shot for 10 days. Redolent of early Jim Jarmusch, it follows several terminally bored students at a pretentious art school, perfectly nailing the pervasive jadedness of wannabe artists. Top indie label Matador Records was to release the movie's soundtrack, but after numerous and lengthy delays, Moritsugu terminated the deal. Stated label head Gerard Cosloy, \"Jon Moritsugu set the Hippy Porn contract on fire and tore the CD negatives apart with his teeth (we didn't have the guts to tell him the test pressings arrived that day).\" Hippy Porn was released theatrically in America and gained noticeable notoriety. Picked up for European distribution, the movie was a hit in the Netherlands, Switzerland and France, playing non-stop in Paris for over one year at the Action Christine Cinema. Moritsugu immediately started pre-production in 1992 for Mod Fuck Explosion, which starred Amy Davis. This low-budget riff on the teen film loosely revolved around a lonely girl's search for a leather jacket while a turf war between mods and bikers looms. The movie, produced by Henry S. Rosenthal and co-produced by Andrea Sperling, was shot by Todd Verow in 16mm. It featured a dream sequence set in garden of meat, which was filmed in Rosenthal's garage with 800 pounds of raw, rotting beef. After wrapping, and in the middle of post-production in 1993, Moritsugu received word that he had received a grant from ITVS to create a PBS television show. He says: \"I completed (the script) in 42 hours... and it got the green light. So right after shooting Mod Fuck Explosion, I got $360,000 to shoot Terminal USA. Terminal USA, filmed in Panavision 16mm, was a vicious sitcom parody laying to waste the studious image of the \"model minority.\" The director himself played twins - a drug-dealing son and a repressed and closeted math nerd - in a radically dysfunctional Asian American family. The movie was an extreme challenge for Moritsugu, who again worked with producer Andrea Sperling and director of photography Todd Verow. In addition to complications with insurance, payroll, salaries and a large unionized cast and crew, the production itself was fraught with problems including a major outbreak of scabies on the set. Executive produced by James Schamus (former CEO of Focus Features), Moritsugu stated: \"I sort of blew it. I was young, full of myself, no one could help me. I basically spit in his face\". When Terminal USA was completed, it caused a firestorm of controversy with the conservative right because it had been funded with taxpayer money. It screened at the Toronto and Rotterdam Film Festivals and was broadcast on television in over 200 cities across America. After a European promotional tour and American appearances to support Terminal USA, Moritsugu resumed post-production work on Mod Fuck Explosion. \"A defiantly rough-hewn return to barely-aboveground roots despite some overlaps with Terminal USA,\" it was completed in 1994 and won \"Best Feature\" Award at the New York Underground Film Festival. It played the film fest circuit and received tremendous attention, with Moritsugu saying, \"Mod Fuck blew-up in Germany, Scandinavia, and the Benelux countries\u2014they really responded to the angst, death, and Amy as a hot blonde walking on raw meat.\" In America, the movie opened in a number of cities including a 13-week engagement in Los Angeles at the Laemmle Sunset 5 and sold-out runs in Seattle and Baltimore. Giant Robot said about the movie: \"Jon Moritsugu hit some weird epiphany during the making of this film, which was his first mass-watchable work. Jon\u2019s wife Amy Davis plays a performance art girl who\u2019s caught in a rumble between a small group of mods and a Japanese motorcycle gang. [\u2026] The performances are weird, intentionally screwed up, and dumb, but that\u2019s part of the film\u2019s brilliance. If you\u2019re a fan of strange flicks, you\u2019ll start remembering the lines and using them. [\u2026] Awesome soundtrack by Unrest and Karyo Tengoku\". The movie was picked by the readers of Wired as one of the \"Wildest Exploitation Movies,\" sharing the honor with Eraserhead, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead and Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!. Moritsugu's next feature was 1997's Fame Whore, which reprised sitcom mockery and absurdism in service of three parallel stories critiquing fame and featuring Amy Davis as a stoner, trust-fund brat. Produced again by Andrea Sperling, the 16mm movie was a recipient of a Rockefeller Foundation Award. It received \"Best Feature\" and \"Festival Choice\" honors at the New York Underground Film Festival and the Los Angeles Times said of it, \"Fame Whore is crude, edgy and energetic, and its stars throw themselves into their roles with welcome gusto.\" The movie opened theatrically throughout the US and Europe, screening at Lincoln Center in NYC and running for 5 weeks in Los Angeles. Fame Whore was considered for an Academy Award in 1999, but it was rejected on a technicality because it had opened in Los Angeles in 16\u00a0mm, and at the time, all Academy Award considerations had to be shown in 35\u00a0mm. In late 1999 Moritsugu started work on his next feature, Scumrock, produced once again by Andrea Sperling. He stated: \"The original plan was for Scumrock to be a $2 million, 35mm picture. I thought it was totally do-able, what with the success of Fame Whore. This budget proved to be elusive so we cut it down to $50,000. And alas, we ended up shooting Scumrock for $5,000 using a $150 camcorder.\" Starring Amy Davis (who also was co-writer and director of photography), James Duval (\"Frank the Bunny\" from Donnie Darko), and Kyp Malone (who would later join the band TV on the Radio), the movie was a deadpan comedy capturing the lives of fringe-art rebels dealing with the perils of turning 30 with little to show for their avant-gardness. After receiving a post-production grant from Creative Capital, the movie's footage was decimated and completely degenerated, Moritsugu's intent being to drag it into the gutter and destroy any sheen or aura of a \"pristine digital look.\" Scumrock was edited on a VHS cuts-only system and upon completion in 2002, it won the \"Best Feature\" Award at the Chicago Underground Film Festival, following that up with a \"Best Feature\" Award at the 2003 New York Underground Film Festival. It was selected by The Village Voice Film Critics Poll as \"Best of 2003\" and then opened theatrically in the US and Canada in 2004, receiving rave reviews from the Los Angeles Times, LA Weekly and E!. After Scumrock, Moritsugu took a break from \"cinema,\" focusing on musical and other creative outlets and moving with Davis to Honolulu, Seattle, and finally Santa Fe."

        "content": "In 2010, Moritsugu began production on his seventh feature, Pig Death Machine. Starring Davis (who was also co-writer) and lensed by Todd Verow in digital video, the movie was shot in the wilds of New Mexico over 12 days with a small crew. In spring 2011 and in the middle of Pig Death Machine post-production, Moritsugu directed with Davis a music video for the song \"No Future Shock\" by Brooklyn rock band TV on the Radio.  As described by writer Rani Molla: \"Santa Fe filmmakers Jon Moritsugu and Amy Davis veer (very slightly) from their underground experimental base with a music video released today for popular Brooklyn experimental band TV on the Radio. The video is one in a movie-length series of music videos for the band's new album Nine Types of Light\". In 2012, the project received a Grammy Nomination in the \"Long Form Music Video\" category. In 2013 Pig Death Machine premiered at the Chicago Underground Film Festival, where Moritsugu and Davis won the \"Jack Smith Lifetime Achievement Award.\" The movie screened at a number of US and international film festivals and also made it onto several \"Best Films of 2013\" lists including one compiled by critic Jack Sargeant. It then opened theatrically across America and also played with the Moritsugu retrospective of 7 features and 9 shorts in select cities including Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. Pig Death Machine received glowing reviews from the Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and LA Weekly. In 2015, Anthology Film Archives of New York City completed a two-year restoration project of Moritsugu's 1987 senior thesis film, Der Elvis. With support from the National Film Preservation Foundation and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the movie was digitally scanned, remastered, reprinted in 16mm and described as, \"one of the most impressive and precocious student films ever made.\" Later that year, Moritsugu wrote and directed his first fashion video lookbook. Created for Mishka NYC's fall 2015 collection, the project was co-written and photographed by Davis and featured the music of Low on High. Also in 2015, James Schamus, former CEO of Focus Features, stated to the New York Times: \"Jon is a true cinema original. I'd rather be spit on by Jon than kissed by 95 percent of the directors out there.\" In September 2016, an exhibition of seven Moritsugu features opened at the Ramiken Crucible in NYC. Entitled \"Semiotics of Sleaze,\" the movies were projected simultaneous on the gallery's walls for a one-month run. The Village Voice wrote: \"Jon Moritsugu's cinema is aggressive, abrasive, and it doesn't stop. His zero-budget movies have spastic editing, disorienting post-sync sound, and bright neon colors; they're a treat for the senses, and poison for the mind... While watching his films, you may feel tired, weak, or nauseous, but you will have had an experience, and a physical one at that \u2013 an effect to which many moving images can't lay claim... The gallery is showing these works simultaneously and blasting them at full volume; you'll feel the noise.\" In August 2017, Moritsugu wrapped principal photography for his eighth feature, Numbskull Revolution. Shot in New Mexico, the movie aims to \"satirize and deconstruct the high art scene in an eyeball-scorching onslaught of mind-blowing narrative madness and honey-laced pathos\".\" It stars James Duval as artist \"Futurecide\" and Amy Davis as twin sisters. Moritsugu landed a book deal in 2018 and is writing his memoir and completing post-production for Numbskull Revolution."

He received multiple undergraduate degrees from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 1982, a master of science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1989, and a PhD in chemical engineering from The University of Texas in 1998. He became acquainted with lithography while working at the Microelectronics Research Laboratory of the NSA. After an assignment to Sematech, he quit his job at the NSA and founded FINLE Technologies (1990) to commercialize PROLITH, the simulator he had developed to model optical and chemical aspects of photolithography. FINLE Technologies was purchased in February 2000 by KLA-Tencor, which now markets PROLITH. In 2017, he cofounded Fractilia, Inc. to deliver MetroLER, a software product that models stochastic effects in the semiconductor manufacturing process. He currently serves as CTO of Fractilia. He is currently an adjunct faculty member at The University of Texas at Austin. He writes a quarterly column called the Lithography Expert. In 2003 he received the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International SEMI Award for North America.

In 1837 he took the degree of Ph.D. with a thesis on the Muschelkalk of Thuringia. In 1850 he became professor of geology and mineralogy in the Royal Polytechnic School at Dresden, and in 1857 he was made director of the Royal Mineralogical and Geological Museum; he held these posts until 1894. He was distinguished for his researches on the Carboniferous and Cretaceous rocks and fossils of Saxony, and in particular for those relating to the fauna and flora of the Permian or, at that time, 'Dyas' formation. He described also the graptolites of the local Silurian strata; and the flora of the coal-formation of the Altay Mountains and of Nebraska. From 1863 to 1878 he was one of the editors of the Neues Jahrbuch. He was awarded the Murchison Medal by the Geological Society of London in 1878. He died at Dresden.

He then was seconded to the European Commission as Chief of Staff to Sir Leon Brittan, returning to be Director, European Strategy and Policy and later Director of Budget and Public Finances under Gordon Brown. In 2003, Rogers was chosen to succeed Jeremy (later Sir Jeremy) Heywood as the Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Tony Blair. After three years in this role, Rogers left the civil service in 2006 to become Head of the UK Public Sector Group at Citigroup. In 2010 Rogers transferred to be Head of the Public Sector Industry Group, UK and Ireland, at Barclays Capital from 2010 to 2011. In 2012, Rogers returned to the civil service as the Prime Minister's Adviser for Europe and Global Issues and the Head of the European and Global Issues Secretariat, based in the Prime Minister's Office at Number 10, replacing Jon Cunliffe who had become the senior British diplomat at the EU. On Cunliffe's move to the Bank of England the next year, Rogers succeeded him again, moving to Brussels in 2013. In 2015, Rogers was paid a salary of between \u00a3170,000 and \u00a3174,999 by the Foreign Office, making him one of the 328 most highly paid people in the British public sector at that time.

        "content": "In December 2016, an internal memo Rogers had written suggesting difficulties for the agreement was leaked. According to this leaked memo, Sir Ivan privately held the view that a settlement between the UK and the European Union might not be reached for 10 years, if at all, which did not reflect the Government's view. Questions were raised in the press whether Downing Street could any longer have confidence in his advice. He resigned on 3 January 2017, nine months ahead of the nominal end of his posting in October 2017. On 11 October 2018, in Cambridge, Rogers delivered a lecture on \"Brexit as Revolution\", in which he said that he continued to think that the risks of an accidental \"no-deal\" Brexit caused by persistent British misreading of others' incentives and views, and by the EU's frequent inability to comprehend UK politics, were higher than was in the price. In a lecture that Rogers delivered on 13 December 2018 at the University of Liverpool, he said that the EU was always adroit at reframing things that have already been agreed, such as the \"backstop\", in ways that \"make the medicine slip down\". Rogers was very critical of the strategy pursued by the British team in their negotiations with the EU following the triggering of Article 50. On 4 March 2019, while speaking to the Institute for Government, he pointed out the similarities in the tactics adopted by Theresa May's government and the tactics used by David Cameron's government in their renegotiations with the EU before the 2016 referendum. He said that May and her advisers' approach was to attempt to deal directly with the leaders of the major governments within the EU but the \"reflex in the British system (is) always to think that we can deal direct with the organ grinders and not the monkeys: it never works like that. It didn't work like that in the Cameron renegotiation either. That stuff is not done in the way British politics works, leader to leader. It's done via the bureaucrats, and the sherpas, and the people at the top of the institutions.\""

She later said she had \"never really done a proper audition before\", and added that \"I had such fun [filming on set], that day actually made me want to pursue [acting] more seriously.\" Later that year she was cast in her first major film role as Jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd (2003). Although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for Nichols. She said, \"I was a sponge for the entire time I was in Atlanta [during filming] and freely admitted that I had no idea what was going on. I had never done a big film before, I had never been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, I was more than willing to take.\" The following year, Nichols played a member of a high school debate team in the independent film Debating Robert Lee (2004) and had a two-episode role in the crime drama television series Line of Fire (2004), which was cancelled after 11 of 13 produced episodes were broadcast. By August 2004, she was cast in supporting roles in the horror films The Amityville Horror (2005) and The Woods (2006). In late February 2004, Nichols was cast in a starring role in a then-untitled drama pilot for the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). According to Variety, her character was to be \"a DEA agent who goes undercover at a high school\". Todd and Glenn Kessler were developing the series, ultimately titled The Inside. The pilot they produced did not satisfy studio executives, however, and Tim Minear was brought in to create a new pilot for the series in late September 2004, replacing the Kesslers as executive producer and showrunner. The Inside was originally supposed to air midseason, but the new pilot itself was reshot and the series was pushed back. The new concept made Nichols' character a rookie FBI agent assigned to the FBI's Los Angeles Violent Crimes Unit. The series premiered in June 2005 and critical reception was mixed; it had been scheduled opposite the popular Dancing with the Stars on ABC, and due to low ratings six of the 13 produced episodes were aired. It was not picked up for further episodes."

        "content": "Following The Inside, Nichols found work on the fifth season of the serial action series Alias in 2005, being cast that July. Nichols starred as Rachel Gibson, a computer expert who thought she was working for the CIA when in fact she was working for a dangerous criminal organization\u2014a situation similar to that of the series' main character Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) in the first season. Discovering the truth, Gibson joins the real CIA and becomes Bristow's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. Of working on Alias, Nichols said that \"to say it's the nicest set on the planet is an understatement\". Her role involved multiple fight sequences, as did Garner's. Nichols worked with Garner's personal trainer; she said she \"already knew that [Garner's] job was extremely hard. But I didn't know how difficult it was until I started training for just one fight.\" Nichols was being groomed to replace Garner as the main character due to the latter's pregnancy, which had been written into the storyline. But Alias was canceled in November 2005, making its fifth season its final. \"I think everybody knew that the show wouldn't work without Jennifer\", Nichols said, \"But still, they were grooming me, so it was heartbreaking when it happened.\" In 2005, Nichols played a brief role in the romantic drama Shopgirl and played a more notable role as a babysitter in The Amityville Horror. For the latter, she was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Scream Scene and the MTV Movie Award for Best Frightened Performance. She later revealed that she almost did not audition for the film due to her fear of dogs. \"[Producer] Michael Bay has these gigantic [dogs]. [...] And, when I went to audition for The Amityville Horror, I went into his offices and literally these three huge dogs were there, and I almost turned around. I was like, 'No, I'm not going to read for this film.' I actually used the dogs in my audition to think of what would scare me the most.\" The Amityville Horror received generally negative reception from critics, but was a commercial success. The Woods, which had been shelved for around 18 months, was released directly-to-DVD in October 2006, to a positive critical response. Nichols had a small part in the drama film Resurrecting the Champ (2007), playing the assistant to a sportswriter (Josh Hartnett) who believes he has found a former boxing legend (Samuel L. Jackson) living homeless on the streets. Also that year, Nichols had a bit part in the fact-based political drama Charlie Wilson's War (2007) and was cast in a new science fiction drama television series Them, which was ultimately not picked up by Fox. Her first starring film role was in the 2007 horror\u2013thriller P2, as a businesswoman who becomes trapped inside a public parking garage with a deranged security guard. About the dress her character wears for much of the film, Nichols said, \"When I read the script originally, it wasn't a dress, it was a small nightgown with no bra or underwear. Then I read the first scene where she gets wet, and I went: 'OK, this has got to be altered! Nichols said in an interview that among the rules established in her contract were: \"I will not get wet and show nipples\" in addition to no nudity. A bra was sewn into the \"Marilyn Monroe dress\" she wore in the film. She said, \"I wasn't going to run around for two months without a bra, I thought that was inappropriate. But in place of the nipples there's clearly a lot of cleavage. So we made a compromise.\" P2 was generally disliked by critics and flopped at the box office. Reviewer James Berardinelli said that her performance was \"admirable, although one wonders whether she was cast more for her physical assets than her acting ability.\" John Anderson of Variety wrote that \"Nichols is in territory well trod over the years by everyone from Fay Wray and Grace Kelly to Heather Langenkamp, the terrified but gutsy heroine, who in this case has been chloroformed and put into a sheer white evening dress by her abductor\u2014who must have anticipated that his captive would try to escape in an elevator, which he could then fill with water. (Nichols' considerable physical attributes, henceforth, seem to occupy most of the screen.) She's sympathetic, hysterical when required and likeable.\" Nichols had a supporting role in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 (2008), playing a jealous friend of America Ferrera's character. Overall, the film was well received by critics. Roger Ebert commented that Nichols as her character Julia \"proves a principle that should be in the Little Movie Glossary: If a short, curvy, sun-kissed heroine [Ferrera] has a tall, thin blond as a roommate, that blond is destined to be a bitch. No way around it.\" Stephen Holden, writing for The New York Times, similarly said, \"It falls to Ms. Nichols to play the movie's designated blond baddie, a cold, arrogant vixen who tries to undermine [Ferrera's character's] triumphs in romance and onstage.\" Nichols was cast in Star Trek (2009) in November 2007, but due to the project's secrecy her role was initially unknown even to her; she said that month she did not even know her character's name. It was speculated that she would play Janice Rand, but she would actually play an Orion cadet at Starfleet Academy. Nichols was cast as Shana \"Scarlett\" O'Hara in the live-action film adaptation of the G.I. Joe franchise G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. \"I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then when I finally got to read it myself\u00a0... I really, really liked it\u00a0... I liked that there were two kick-ass female roles. And I liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie\u00a0... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised when I read the script.\" She put on approximately  of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had \"an appealing manner and comely biceps\" as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her \"savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness.\" After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played the half of a newly wed couple buying a house with a secret past. The film only received a direct-to-DVD release."

In the 3-D sword and sorcery film Conan the Barbarian, a reimagining of the 1982 Arnold Schwarzenegger film of the same name. Nichols starred as a master of martial arts, a priestess, and the love interest of the titular character. She performed her own stunts in the high-stakes action scenes and fight sequences, but a double was used for a sex scene with co-star Jason Momoa. Filming occurred between March and July 2010 in Bulgaria, and Conan was released on August 19, 2011. Budgeted at US$90million, the film received negative reviews, and only grossed US$48.8 worldwide. Boston Globe felt that Nichols portrayed her \"pure-blooded innocent\" character with the \"enthusiasm of a bored office receptionist\". Nichols first guest starred in three episodes of the CBS television series Criminal Minds and was then promoted as a series regular. Her role was Ashley Seaver, an FBI cadet assigned to the BAU. The casting choice came amid uproar from the series' fanbase as she was brought in to replace exiting actresses A.J. Cook and Paget Brewster. However, as the season progressed, viewers eventually warmed to the character. \"It just kind of worked. It was a long process,\" she said. It was eventually announced that Nichols had been let go from the show. Nichols next starred in the independent romantic comedy A Bird of the Air (2011) as \"a librarian who joins a highway patrolman to uncover the mysteries behind the cryptic sayings spoken by an ancient parrot.\" She described the production as a \"quirky, edgy love story\" and felt that her part was a \"departure from some of the roles I've been offered\". The film received a limited theatrical release and a mixed critical response. The New York Times remarked that the actress \"is consistently appealing in the kind of role Zooey Deschanel has pretty much cornered\", while the Village Voice found her character to be a \"grating twit\". In Continuum, a Canadian science fiction TV series, Nichols starred as a police officer against a group of rebels from the year 2077 who time-travel to Vancouver in the year 2012. The series premiered on Showcase on May 27, 2012, and its first episode became the highest-rated episode in the network's history. Continuum ran for four seasons until October 9, 2015, and earned Nichols a Constellation Award and two Saturn Award nominations for Best Actress on Television. Nichols starred opposite Tyler Perry in the thriller Alex Cross (2012), as the blighted colleague of a psychologist and police lieutenant. Like Conan, her previous wide release, the film garnered negative reviews, and made a lackluster US$34.6million worldwide. In the independent exploitation film Raze (2013), she appeared opposite Zo\u00eb Bell as women forced to fight against each other for the twisted entertainment of the wealthy elite. Nichols is credited as an executive producer in the film, and was drawn to the project for its female \"empowering\" message, remarking: \"Give us a challenge and we'll meet it. We're stronger than you think we are. I loved that about it. That was what drew me to it and that's what had always been promised\". Raze premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and received a limited release in NYC and Los Angeles. She next starred with Nicolas Cage in the action thriller Rage (2014), as the wife of a reformed criminal seeking his own brand of justice after their daughter gets kidnapped. The film was released for selected theaters and VOD. In 2014, she made a one-episode appearance in the Lifetime series Witches of East End and debuted in a recurring arc in USA Network's Rush. The following year, she obtained a recurring role as a \"problem employee at the law firm she works at\" in the fourth season of Chicago Fire. Nichols starred in the science-fiction thriller Pandemic (2016) as a doctor who leads a group to find survivors of a worldwide pandemic. The film was released for selected theaters and VOD, and in its review, The Hollywood Reporter remarked that Nichols \"attempts to adopt an attitude somewhere between shell-shocked survivor and sympathetic physician, but doesn't manage to fulfill the role's potential\". In Inside (2016), a Spanish-American remake of the 2007 French horror film of the same name, Nichols took on the starring role of a pregnant woman accosted in her home by an unknown woman who intends to steal her baby. The film was released in Spain cinemas on July 28, 2017, where it made US$557,083, and in the United States on January 12, 2018. Nichols next obtained another recurring role on television as a former guardian who has been thrust back five centuries into the past to finally move forward, in the fourth season of the TNT fantasy series The Librarians. For her four-episode performance, she received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Guest Starring Role on Television. In 2019, Nichols had a five-episode run as Martha Stroud, a Gestapo bodyguard, on the fourth season of the alternate history series The Man in the High Castle."

Within 3 months she was in Delano, California working for Cesar Chavez of the United Farm Workers (UFW). She later worked in organizing grape and lettuce boycotts in Detroit and Cleveland in support of agricultural labor strikes in California. In 1972 Loesch became one of the founding members of the Pax (Peace) Center in Erie, Pennsylvania, joining Sr. Mary Lou Kownacki, OSB, in forming a Catholic feminist peace community. This group, comprising Benedictine Sisters and lay associates, was organized more or less on the Catholic Worker model, combining activism with the Works of Mercy (soup kitchen, homeless shelter work. etc.) The Pax Center, together with other Catholic antiwar activist groups, soon morphed into Pax Christi USA, the American affiliate of Pax Christi, an international Catholic peace movement. In the late 1970s, Loesch became an activist associated with the \"Mobilization for Survival\", a coalition which opposed nuclear weapons. She became convinced that abortion and the nuclear arms race were moral equivalents, and advocated partnership between the peace and pro-life movements. In 1979, she founded the \"bridge\" organization Prolifers for Survival, which operated until 1987. She has written extensively on these and related subjects.

In 1926, in Clearwater, Florida, when Berryman was 11 years old, his father shot and killed himself. Smith was jobless at the time, and he and Martha were filing for divorce. Berryman was haunted by his father's death for the rest of his life and wrote about his struggle to come to terms with it in much of his poetry. In \"Dream Song #143\", he wrote, \"That mad drive [to commit suicide] wiped out my childhood. I put him down/while all the same on forty years I love him/stashed in Oklahoma/besides his brother Will\". In \"Dream Song #145\", he also wrote of his father:"

        "content": "After his father's death at the rear entrance to Kipling Arms, where the Smiths rented an apartment, the poet's mother, within months, married John Angus McAlpin Berryman in New York City. The poet was renamed John Allyn McAlpin Berryman. Berryman's mother also changed her first name from Peggy to Jill. Although his stepfather later divorced his mother, Berryman and his stepfather stayed on good terms. With both his mother and stepfather working, his mother decided to send him to the South Kent School, a private boarding school in Connecticut. Berryman then attended Columbia College, where he was president of the Philolexian Society, joined the Boar's Head Society, edited The Columbia Review, and studied under the literary scholar and poet Mark Van Doren. Berryman later credited Van Doren with sparking his interest in writing poetry seriously. For two years, Berryman also studied overseas at Clare College, Cambridge, on a Kellett Fellowship from Columbia. He graduated in 1936. Berryman's early work formed part of a volume titled Five Young American Poets, published by New Directions in 1940\". One of the other young poets included in the book was Randall Jarrell. Berryman published some of this early verse in his first book, Poems, in 1942. His first mature collection of poems, The Dispossessed, appeared six years later, published by William Sloane Associates. The book received largely negative reviews from poets like Jarrell, who wrote, in The Nation, that Berryman was \"a complicated, nervous, and intelligent [poet]\" whose work was too derivative of W. B. Yeats. Berryman later concurred with this assessment of his early work, saying, \"I didn't want to be like Yeats; I wanted to be Yeats.\" In October 1942, Berryman married Eileen Mulligan (later Simpson) in a ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral, with Van Doren as his best man. The couple moved to Beacon Hill, and Berryman lectured at Harvard. The marriage ended in 1953 (the divorce was formalized in 1956), when Simpson finally grew weary of Berryman's affairs and acting as \"net-holder\" during his self-destructive personal crises. Simpson memorialized her time with Berryman and his circle in her 1982 book Poets in Their Youth. In 1947, Berryman started an affair with a married woman named Chris Haynes, documented in a long sonnet sequence that he refrained from publishing in part because that would have revealed the affair to his wife. He eventually published the work, Berryman's Sonnets, in 1967. It includes over one hundred sonnets. In 1950, Berryman published a biography of the fiction writer and poet Stephen Crane, whom he greatly admired. The book was followed by his next significant poem, Homage to Mistress Bradstreet (1956), which featured illustrations by the artist Ben Shahn and was Berryman's first poem to receive \"national attention\" and a positive response from critics. Edmund Wilson wrote that it was \"the most distinguished long poem by an American since T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land.\" When Homage to Mistress Bradstreet and Other Poems was published in 1959, the poet Conrad Aiken praised the book's shorter poems, which he found superior to \"Homage to Mistress Bradstreet\". Despite his third book of verse's relative success, Berryman's great poetic breakthrough occurred with 77 Dream Songs (1964). It won the 1965 Pulitzer Prize for poetry and solidified Berryman's standing as one of the most important poets of the post-World War II generation that included Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop, and Delmore Schwartz. Soon thereafter, the press began to give Berryman a great deal of attention, as did arts organizations and even the White House, which sent him an invitation to dine with President Lyndon B. Johnson (though Berryman declined because he was in Ireland at the time). Berryman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1967, and that same year Life magazine ran a feature story on him. Also that year the newly created National Endowment for the Arts awarded him a $10,000 grant (when a Minneapolis reporter asked him about the award, he said that he had never heard of NEA before receiving it). Berryman also continued to work on the \"dream song\" poems at a feverish pace and in 1968 published a second, significantly longer, volume, His Toy, His Dream, His Rest, which won the National Book Award for Poetry and the Bollingen Prize. The next year Berryman republished 77 Dreams Songs and His Toy, His Dream, His Rest as one book, The Dream Songs, in which the character Henry serves as Berryman's alter ego. In Love & Fame (1970), he dropped the mask of Henry to write more plainly about his life. Responses to the poems from critics and most of Berryman's peers ranged from tepid to hostile; the collection is now generally \"considered a minor work\". Henry reappeared in a couple of poems published in Delusions Etc. (1972), Berryman's last collection, which focused on his religious concerns and spiritual rebirth. The book was published posthumously and, like Love & Fame, is considered a minor work. Berryman taught or lectured at a number of universities, including the University of Iowa (at the Writer's Workshop), Harvard University, Princeton University, the University of Cincinnati, and the University of Minnesota, where he spent most of his career, except for his sabbatical year in 1962\u20133, when he taught at Brown University. Some of his illustrious students included W. D. Snodgrass, William Dickey, Donald Justice, Philip Levine, Robert Dana, Jane Cooper, Donald Finkel, and Henri Coulette. In a 2009 interview, Levine said Berryman took his class extremely seriously and that \"he was entrancing ... magnetic and inspiring and very hard on [his students'] work ... [and] he was [also] the best teacher that I ever had\". Berryman was fired from the University of Iowa after a fight with his landlord led to him being arrested, jailed overnight, and fined for disorderly conduct and public intoxication. His friend the poet Allen Tate helped him get the job at the University of Minnesota."

During one of the many times he was hospitalized for alcohol abuse, in 1970, he experienced what he termed \"a sort of religious conversion\". According to his biographer Paul Mariani, Berryman experienced \"a sudden and radical shift from a belief in a transcendent God ... to a belief in a God who cared for the individual fates of human beings and who even interceded for them.\" Nevertheless, Berryman continued to abuse alcohol and struggle with depression, as he had throughout much of his life, and on the morning of January 7, 1972, he killed himself by jumping from the Washington Avenue Bridge in Minneapolis onto the west bank of the Mississippi River."

        "title": "John Berryman_Poetry",
        "content": "Berryman's poetry, which often revolves around the sordid details of his personal problems, is closely associated with the \"confessional\" poetry movement. In this sense, his poetry had much in common with the poetry of his friend Robert Lowell. The editors of The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry note that \"the influence of Yeats, Auden, Hopkins, Crane, and Pound on him was strong, and Berryman's own voice\u2014by turns nerve-racked and sportive\u2014took some time to be heard.\" Berryman's first major work, in which he began to develop his own style, was Homage to Mistress Bradstreet. In the long, title poem, which first appeared in Partisan Review in 1953, Berryman addresses the 17th-century American poet Anne Bradstreet, combining her life history with his fantasies about her (and inserting himself into the poem). Joel Athey noted, \"This difficult poem, a tribute to the Puritan poet of colonial America, took Berryman five years to complete and demanded much from the reader when it first appeared with no notes. The Times Literary Supplement hailed it as a path-breaking masterpiece; poet Robert Fitzgerald called it 'the poem of his generation.'\" Edward Hirsch observed that \"the 57 stanzas of Homage to Mistress Bradstreet combine the concentration of an extended lyric with the erudition and amplitude of a historical novel\". Berryman's major poetic breakthrough came after the first volume of The Dream Songs, 77 Dream Songs, in 1964. The dream song form consists of short, 18-line lyric poems in three stanzas. They are in free verse, with some stanzas containing irregular rhyme. 77 Dream Songs (and its sequel His Toy, His Dream, His Rest) centers on a character named Henry who bears a striking resemblance to Berryman, but Berryman was careful to make sure his readers realized that Henry was a fictional version of himself (or a literary alter ego). In an interview, Berryman said, \"Henry does resemble me, and I resemble Henry; but on the other hand I am not Henry. You know, I pay income tax; Henry pays no income tax. And bats come over and they stall in my hair \u2014 and fuck them, I'm not Henry; Henry doesn't have any bats.\" John Malcolm Brinnin, reviewing 77 Dream Songs in The New York Times, wrote that its \"excellence calls for celebration\". Robert Lowell wrote in The New York Review of Books, \"At first the brain aches and freezes at so much darkness, disorder and oddness. After a while, the repeated situations and their racy jabber become more and more enjoyable, although even now I wouldn't trust myself to paraphrase accurately at least half the sections.\" In response to the perceived difficulty of the dream songs, in his 366th \"Dream Song\", Berryman facetiously wrote, \"These Songs are not meant to be understood, you understand. / They are only meant to terrify & comfort\". In His Toy, His Dream, His Rest, many of the dream songs are elegies for Berryman's recently deceased poet friends, including Delmore Schwartz, Randall Jarrell, and Theodore Roethke. The volume contains four times as many poems as the previous one, and covers more subject matter. For instance, in addition to the elegies, Berryman writes about his trip to Ireland, as well as his own burgeoning literary fame. Berryman's last two volumes of poetry, Love & Fame and Delusions, Etc., featured free-verse poems that were much more straightforward and less idiosyncratic than The Dream Songs. Before Love & Fame's publication, Berryman sent his manuscript to several peers for feedback, including the poets Adrienne Rich and Richard Wilbur, both of whom were disappointed with the poems, which they considered inferior to those of The Dream Songs. But some of Berryman's old friends and supporters, including Lowell, the novelist Saul Bellow, and the poet William Meredith, offered high praise for a number of the Love & Fame poems. Love & Fame and Delusions, Etc. were more openly \"confessional\" than Berryman's earlier verse, and also explored the nature of his spiritual rebirth in poems like \"Eleven Addresses to the Lord\" (which Lowell thought one of Berryman's best poems and \"one of the great poems of the age\") and \"Certainty Before Lunch\". In 1977 John Haffenden published Henry's Fate & Other Poems, a selection of dream songs that Berryman wrote after His Toy, His Dream, His Rest but did not publish. According to Time magazine's review, \"Posthumous selections of unpublished poetry should be viewed suspiciously. The dead poet may have had good aesthetic reasons for keeping some of his work to himself. Fortunately, Henry's Fate does not malign the memory of John Berryman\". Berryman's Collected Poems--1937-1971, edited and introduced by Charles Thornbury, was published in 1989. Robert Giroux decided to omit The Dream Songs from the collection. In his review of the Collected Poems, Edward Hirsch said of this decision, \"It is obviously practical to continue to publish the 385 dream songs separately, but reading the Collected Poems without them is a little like eating a seven-course meal without a main course.\" Hirsch also wrote that, \"[Collected Poems features] a thorough nine-part introduction and a chronology as well as helpful appendixes that include Berryman's published prefaces, notes and dedications; a section of editor's notes, guidelines and procedures; and an account of the poems in their final stages of composition and publication.\" In 2004, the Library of America published John Berryman: Selected Poems, edited by the poet Kevin Young. In Poetry magazine, David Orr wrote: Young includes all the Greatest Hits [from Berryman's career] ... but there are also substantial excerpts from Berryman's Sonnets (the peculiar book that appeared after The Dream Songs, but was written long before) and Berryman's later, overtly religious poetry. Young argues that \"if his middle, elegiac period ... is most in need of rediscovery, then these late poems are most in need of redemption.\" It's a good point. Although portions of Berryman's late work are sloppy and erratic, these poems help clarify the spiritual struggle that motivates and sustains his best writing. After surveying Berryman's career and accomplishments, the editors of The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry wrote, \"What seems likely to survive of his poetry is its pungent and many-leveled portrait of a complex personality which, for all its eccentricity, stayed close to the center of the intellectual and emotional life of the mid-century and after.\""

        "content": "Henry Balfour Gardiner (7 November 1877 \u2013 28 June 1950) was a British musician, composer, and teacher. He was born at Kensington (London). Between his conventional education at Charterhouse School and New College, Oxford, where he obtained only a pass degree, Gardiner was a piano student at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, where he was taught by Iwan Knorr and Lazzaro Uzielli, who had been a pupil of Clara Schumann. He belonged to the Frankfurt Group, a circle of composers who studied at the Hoch Conservatory in the late 1890s. With George Gardiner (no relation) he collected folk songs in Hampshire (1905\u20131906), taught music briefly at Winchester College (1907), and composed. His works included compositions in a variety of genres, including two symphonies (No 2 premiered at the Proms in 1908), but many of his scores, including the symphonies, are lost and only a very limited amount of his music survives. His best-known work Evening Hymn (1908), a setting of the compline hymn \"Te lucis ante terminum\", is a lush, romantic work for eight-part choir and organ, of dense harmonies. For most of the time, it sits in four parts, though the treble, alto, tenor, and bass parts all subdivide at various points. It is considered a classic of the English choral repertoire and is still regularly performed as an anthem at Evensong in Anglican churches. The fame of this work has overshadowed his surviving orchestral works, which include Overture to a Comedy (1906, revised 1911), the Percy Grainger-like Shepherd Fennell's Dance (1911) (once a favourite at the Proms, chalking up 35 performances between 1911 and 1951), and the Delius-like A Berkshire Idyll, the latter written in 1913 at Field House, Ashampstead Green in Berkshire, where he lived between 1911 and 1930. The first performance of the Idyll (along with two other unpublished pieces, Philomela and the choral setting April), took place on 6 May 1955 at the Royal Festival Hall, 42 years after its completion. It was recorded in 2017 for the first time. Also surviving are a number of short piano works and songs. Gardiner's most important work, possibly, was his promotion of the music of contemporary British and colonial composers, particularly through a series of concerts he personally financed at Queen's Hall London in 1912 to 1913. The composers represented included Arnold Bax, Frederic Austin, Gustav Holst, Percy Grainger, Roger Quilter, Cyril Scott and Norman O'Neill. (The last four had also studied with him at Frankfurt.) Gardiner was very generous with his personal fortune, paying for a private benefit performance of The Planets for Holst in 1918 and purchasing Frederick Delius's house at Grez-sur-Loing to enable him to continue living in it at the end of his life. In the early 1920s he also became a patron of Charles Kennedy Scott, conductor and founder of the Philharmonic Choir which was the predecessor of the present London Philharmonic Choir. Gardiner gave up composing in 1925 largely because he was intensely self-critical: much of his lost music was probably destroyed by him. Thereafter, he devoted himself to a pioneering afforestation programme on his Dorset pig farm. He died in Salisbury. He was the great-uncle of the conductor Sir John Eliot Gardiner."

He quickly established himself as a national party leader and in August 2002 was elected to the nine-member National Executive Committee, the PRD's top governing organism. In 2008 he was re-elected into the National Executive Committee as the most voted member. In September 2008, he participated in his party's primaries for President against the then Housing Minister, Balbina Herrera. He was defeated by 4%, thus losing an election for the first time in his political career. Even though he had lost the primaries, he had almost half the party supporting his candidacy and this led Balbina Herrera to nominate him as Vice-Presidential candidate in the PRD ticket for the 2009 presidential election. In that election the PRD and Balbina Herrera lost to Ricardo Martinelli and Juan Carlos Varela by a wide margin. This led Juan Carlos Navarro to call for all the National Executive Committee members to resign based on the poor election results. In October 2009, Juan Carlos Navarro resigned his post as First Under Secretary in the National Executive Committee and shortly thereafter all other members resigned, including Balbina Herrera and then Secretary-General Martin Torrijos. In 2012, Juan Carlos Navarro was elected Secretary-General of the PRD, the top post in the party's structure. The political movement he led won all 10 posts of the National Executive Committee; it was the first time in history that all 10 posts were held by the same party. In March 2013 he participated once again in his party's primaries for President against 17 other candidates and won with over 95% of the vote. In the 2014 Presidential elections, he came third with 28% of the vote. Even though Navarro lost the election, the party won a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. For this reason, after the election Navarro negotiated a legislative pact called \"Panama Primero\" with President-elect Juan Carlos Varela to secure that many of the projects proposed during his campaign would become a reality. These proposals include the Minister for Environmental Issues and a complete decentralization of the government. Once the legislative pact was finalized, Navarro resigned his post as Secretary General of the PRD accepting his responsibility for the election results. On July 10, 2018, Navarro once again registered to participate in the PRD primaries, which were to be held on September 16 of the same year. He aspired to be chosen as his party's presidential candidate for the General Elections to be held on May 5, 2019. Navarro announced on August 21, 2018 that he was declining his aspirations to be chosen as the PRD's presidential candidate in order to back Ernesto P\u00e9rez Balladares in his bid to be the party's nominee. In the September 16th primaries, the Balladares-Navarro allegiance came in third place, obtaining 8% of the vote. Laurentino Cortizo won the PRD's presidential nomination."

        "content": "Rafael Edward \"Ted\" Cruz (; born December 22, 1970) is an American politician and attorney serving as the junior United States senator for Texas since 2013. A member of the Republican Party, Cruz served as Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008. After graduating from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, Cruz pursued a career in politics. He worked as a policy advisor in the George W. Bush administration before serving as Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008. In 2012, Cruz was elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first Hispanic-American to serve as a U.S. senator from Texas. In the Senate, Cruz has taken consistently conservative positions on economic and social policy; he played a leading role in the 2013 United States federal government shutdown, seeking to force Congress and President Barack Obama to defund the Affordable Care Act. He was reelected in a close Senate race in 2018 against Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke. In 2016, Cruz ran for president of the United States, placing second behind Donald Trump in the Republican primaries. The competition for the Republican presidential nomination between Trump and Cruz was deeply acrimonious and characterized by a series of public personal attacks. While Cruz initially declined to endorse Trump's campaign once he won the nomination, he became a staunch Trump supporter during the latter's presidency. After the January 2021 Capitol attack, Cruz provoked widespread political and popular backlash for objecting to the certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election and giving credence to the false claim that the election was stolen from Trump."

        "content": "Rafael Edward Cruz was born on December 22, 1970, at Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to Eleanor Elizabeth () Wilson and Rafael Cruz. Eleanor Wilson was born in Wilmington, Delaware. She is of three-quarters Irish and one-quarter Italian descent, and earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Rice University in the 1950s. Cruz's father was born and raised in Cuba, the son of a Canary Islander who immigrated to Cuba as child. As a teenager in the 1950s, he was beaten by agents of Fulgencio Batista for opposing the Batista regime. He left Cuba in 1957 to attend the University of Texas at Austin and obtained political asylum in the United States after his four-year student visa expired. He earned Canadian citizenship in 1973 and became a naturalized United States citizen in 2005. At the time of his birth, Ted Cruz's parents had lived in Calgary for three years and were working in the oil business as owners of a seismic-data processing firm for oil drilling. Cruz has said that he is the son of \"two mathematicians/computer programmers.\" In 1974, Cruz's father left the family and moved to Texas. Later that year, Cruz's parents reconciled and relocated the family to Houston. They divorced in 1997. Cruz has two older half-sisters, Miriam Ceferina Cruz and Roxana Lourdes Cruz, from his father's first marriage. Miriam died in 2011. Cruz began going by Ted at age 13."

Cruz attended two private high schools: Faith West Academy, near Katy, Texas; and Second Baptist High School in Houston, from which he graduated as valedictorian in 1988. During high school, Cruz participated in a Houston-based group known at the time as the Free Market Education Foundation, a program that taught high school students the philosophies of economists such as Milton Friedman and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat. Cruz graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts in public policy from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. While at Princeton, he competed for the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel and won the top speaker award at both the 1992 U.S. National Debating Championship and the 1992 North American Debating Championship. In 1992, he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year and, with his debate partner David Panton, Team of the Year by the American Parliamentary Debate Association. Cruz and Panton later represented Harvard Law School at the 1995 World Debating Championship, losing in the semifinals to a team from Australia. Princeton's debate team named their annual novice championship after Cruz. At Princeton, Cruz was a member of Colonial Club. Cruz's 115-page senior thesis at Princeton investigated the separation of powers; its title, Clipping the Wings of Angels: The History and Theory behind the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, was inspired by a passage attributed to James Madison from the 51st essay of the Federalist Papers: \"If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\" Cruz argued that the drafters of the Constitution intended to protect their constituents' rights, and that the last two items in the Bill of Rights offer an explicit stop against an all-powerful state. After graduating from Princeton, Cruz attended Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude in 1995 with a Juris Doctor degree. While at Harvard Law, he was a primary editor of the Harvard Law Review, an executive editor of the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, and a founding editor of the Harvard Latino Law Review. Referring to Cruz's time as a student at Harvard Law, Professor Alan Dershowitz said: \"Cruz was off-the-charts brilliant.\" At Harvard Law, Cruz was a John M. Olin Fellow in Law and Economics. Cruz serves on the Board of Advisors of the Texas Review of Law and Politics."

        "content": "Appointed to the office of Solicitor General of Texas by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, Cruz served in that position from 2003 to 2008. The office was established in 1999 to handle appeals involving the state, but Abbott hired Cruz with the idea that Cruz would take a \"leadership role in the United States in articulating a vision of strict constructionism\". As Solicitor General, Cruz argued before the Supreme Court of the United States nine times, winning five cases and losing four. Cruz authored 70 U.S. Supreme Court briefs and presented 43 oral arguments. His nine appearances before the Supreme Court are the most by any practicing lawyer in Texas or current member of Congress. Cruz has said, \"We ended up year after year arguing some of the biggest cases in the country. There was a degree of serendipity in that, but there was also a concerted effort to seek out and lead conservative fights.\" In 2003, while Cruz was Texas Solicitor General, the Texas Attorney General's office declined to defend Texas's sodomy law in Lawrence v. Texas, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state laws banning homosexual sex were unconstitutional. In the landmark case of District of Columbia v. Heller, Cruz drafted the amicus brief signed by the attorneys general of 31 states arguing that the Washington, D.C. handgun ban should be struck down as infringing upon the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. He also presented oral argument for the amici states in the companion case to Heller before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Cruz successfully defended the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol grounds before the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, winning 5\u20134 in Van Orden v. Perry. In 2004, Cruz was involved in the high-profile case surrounding a challenge to the constitutionality of public schools' requiring students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance (including the words \"under God\", legally a part of the Pledge since 1954), Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow. He wrote a brief on behalf of all 50 states that argued that the plaintiff, a non-custodial parent, did not have standing to file suit on his daughter's behalf. The Supreme Court upheld the position of Cruz's brief. Cruz served as lead counsel for the state and successfully defended the multiple litigation challenges to the 2003 Texas congressional redistricting plan in state and federal district courts and before the U.S. Supreme Court, which was decided 5\u20134 in his favor in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry. In Medellin v. Texas, Cruz successfully defended Texas against an attempt to reopen the cases of 51 Mexican nationals, all of whom were convicted of murder in the United States and on death row. With the support of the George W. Bush Administration, the petitioners argued that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by failing to notify the convicted nationals of their opportunity to receive legal aid from the Mexican consulate. They based their case on a decision of the International Court of Justice in the Avena case, which ruled that by failing to allow access to the Mexican consulate, the United States had breached its obligations under the Convention. Texas won the case in a 6\u20133 decision, the Supreme Court holding that ICJ decisions were not binding in domestic law and that the President had no power to enforce them. Michael Wayne Haley was arrested for stealing a calculator from Walmart in 1997. Because of Haley's previous criminal convictions, he was sentenced to 16-and-a-half years in prison under the Texas habitual offender law. After Haley had exhausted his appeals, it became known that Haley's robbery offense occurred three days before one of his other convictions was finalized; this raised a question about the applicability of the habitual offender statute in his case. As Solicitor General, Cruz declined to vacate Haley's sentence, saying \"I think justice is being done because he had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his errors.\" The Supreme Court later remanded the case to lower courts based on Haley's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. During oral argument, Cruz conceded that Haley had a very strong argument for ineffective assistance of counsel since Haley's attorney failed to recognize the sentencing error and that he would not move to have Haley re-incarcerated during the appeal process. After remand, Haley was re-sentenced to \"time served\". In 2008 American Lawyer magazine named Cruz one of the 50 Best Litigators under 45 in America, and The National Law Journal named him one of the 50 Most Influential Minority Lawyers in America. In 2010 Texas Lawyer named him one of the 25 Greatest Texas Lawyers of the Past Quarter Century."

At Morgan Lewis, he led the firm's U.S. Supreme Court and national appellate litigation practice. In 2010, he abandoned a bid for state attorney general when incumbent Attorney General Greg Abbott, who hired Cruz as Solicitor General, decided to run for reelection. At Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Cruz represented Pfizer in a lawsuit brought by a group of public hospitals and community health centers, who accused Pfizer of overcharging. Shandong Linglong Rubber Company was found guilty of marketing versions of tires that were based on blueprints stolen by a former employee of a Florida businessman and ordered to pay $26 million to the Floridian. Cruz worked on the Chinese company's appellant brief. The appeals court denied the appeal and affirmed the jury's award. Cruz represented drug manufacturer B. Braun Medical Inc. in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit after the company was found guilty of wrongfully discharging a former employee. Cruz asserted that she had failed to prove that B. Braun had directed her to violate the law and that she had not presented sufficient evidence that her refusal to violate the law was why she had been fired. The appeals court rejected Cruz's argument and affirmed the $880,000 award. Cruz represented Toyota in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court in a statute of limitations case, where a judge wanted to investigate Toyota for contempt after a former Toyota in-house lawyer accused Toyota of unlawfully withholding documents in a product liability case. Cruz unsuccessfully argued the judge's jurisdiction expired 30 days after the case was dismissed following an out-of-court settlement, but later won a second appeal using the same argument. Cruz defended two record-setting $54-million personal injury awards in New Mexico at the appellate level, including one that had been thrown out by a lower court. He represented a mentally disabled man who was allegedly raped by an employee of the facility where he lived, and the family of a 78-year-old resident of an Albuquerque nursing home who died of internal bleeding. The settlements were sealed in both cases."

On January 19, 2011, after U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said she would not seek reelection, Cruz launched his campaign via a blogger conference call. In the Republican primary, he ran against sitting Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. Cruz was endorsed first by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and then by the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative political action committee; Erick Erickson, former editor of prominent conservative blog RedState; the FreedomWorks for America super PAC; nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin; Tea Party Express; Young Conservatives of Texas; and U.S. Senators Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint, Mike Lee, Rand Paul and Pat Toomey. He was also endorsed by former Texas Congressman Ron Paul, George P. Bush, and former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum. Former Attorney General Ed Meese served as national chairman of Cruz's campaign. Cruz won the runoff for the Republican nomination by a 14-point margin over Dewhurst, support for Dewhurst having plummeted while Cruz's vote total dramatically increased from the first round. Cruz won despite being outspent by Dewhurst, who held a statewide elected office, $19 million to $7 million. In the November 6 general election, Cruz faced Democratic nominee Paul Sadler, an attorney and a former state representative from Henderson, in east Texas. Cruz won with 4.5 million votes (56.4%) to Sadler's 3.2 million (40.6%). Two minor candidates garnered the remaining 3% of the vote. According to a poll by Cruz's pollster Wilson Perkins Allen Opinion Research, Cruz received 40% of the Hispanic vote, outperforming Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney among Hispanics in Texas. After Time magazine reported that Cruz might have violated ethics rules by failing to publicly disclose his financial relationship with Caribbean Equity Partners Investment Holdings during the 2012 campaign, he said his failure to disclose the connection was inadvertent. In January 2016, The New York Times reported that Cruz and his wife had taken out nearly $1 million in low-interest loans from Goldman Sachs (where she worked) and Citibank, and failed to report them on Federal Election Commission disclosure statements as required by law. Cruz disclosed the loans on his Senate financial disclosure forms in July 2012, but not on the FEC form. There is no indication that Cruz's wife had any role in providing any of the loans, or that the banks did anything wrong. The loans were largely repaid by later campaign fundraising. A spokesperson for Cruz said his failure to report the loans to the FEC was \"inadvertent\" and that he would file supplementary paperwork. But Cruz intentionally missed the deadline for repayment in order to challenge the law that only $250,000 in personal loans can be repaid with money raised after an election. As of January 2022, the Supreme Court in Federal Election Commission v. Ted Cruz for Senate appears to side with Cruz."

In the U.S. Senate, former Majority Leader Harry Reid blocked the filibuster attempt because only 18 Republican Senators supported the filibuster. During the filibuster he read Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss. To supporters, the move \"signaled the depth of Cruz's commitment to rein in government\". This move was extremely popular among Cruz supporters, with Rick Manning of Americans for Limited Government naming Cruz \"2013 Person of the Year\" in an op-ed in The Hill, primarily for his filibuster against the Affordable Care Act. Cruz was also named \"2013 Man of the Year\" by conservative publications TheBlaze, and The American Spectator, \"2013 Conservative of the Year\" by Townhall.com, and \"2013 Statesman of the Year\" by the Republican Party of Sarasota County, Florida.

In the same speech, Cruz invoked the speeches of the ancient Roman senator Cicero against Catiline to denounce Obama's planned executive actions on immigration reform. Classics Professor Jesse Weiner, writing in The Atlantic, said that Cruz's analogy was \"deeply disquieting\" because \"In casting Obama in the role of Catiline, Cruz unsubtly suggests that the sitting president was not lawfully elected and is the perpetrator of a violent insurrection to overthrow the government ... In effect, he accuses the president of high treason. Regardless of one's views on immigration reform and the Obama administration at large, this is dangerous rhetoric.\" Cruz has repeatedly said that the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran \"will make the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism\". In response, Obama called Cruz's statements an example of \"outrageous attacks\" from Republican critics that crossed the line of responsible discourse: \"We've had a sitting senator, who also happens to be running for President, suggest that I'm the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now.\" Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney also criticized Cruz's remarks, writing that although he, too, opposed the Iran agreement, Cruz's statement connecting Obama to terrorism was \"way over the line\" and \"hurts the cause\". After the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Cruz said that the winner of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, rather than Obama, should appoint a new Justice. In June 2016, Cruz blamed the Obama administration for the Orlando nightclub shooting, reasoning that it did not track the perpetrator Omar Mateen properly while he was on the terrorist watch-list. Following the terrorist attack on Nice, France, Cruz said in a statement that the country was at risk as a result of the Obama administration having a \"willful blindness\" to radical Islamists. With the passing of Fidel Castro in November, Cruz charged Obama with celebrating and lionizing Castro in public statements he made addressing the death. On December 28, after Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the U.S.'s decision to allow a U.N. resolution to pass that condemned Israeli settlements \"on land meant to be part of a future Palestinian state\", Cruz denounced the speech as \"disgraceful\", and said that history would remember Obama and Kerry as \"relentless enemies of Israel\". Cruz also accused the Obama administration of having a \"radical anti-Israel agenda\"."

Cruz's role in the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 in particular attracted criticism from a number of Republican colleagues. Republican Senator John McCain was reported to have particularly disliked Cruz; in a Senate floor speech in 2013, McCain denounced Cruz's reference to Nazis when discussing the Affordable Care Act. In March 2013, McCain also called Cruz and others \"wacko birds\" whose beliefs are not \"reflective of the views of the majority of Republicans\". During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, John Boehner described Cruz as \"Lucifer in the flesh\"; in an interview, Lindsey Graham said, \"If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.\" In a heated Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling \"a flat-out lie\" over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. \"What we just saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again was a simple lie\", Cruz said. His \"incendiary outburst\" was \"unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate\", according to Reuters. In the same speech, Cruz assailed the \"Republican majority in both houses of Congresses\" for what he called an insufficiently conservative record. His speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with McCain saying that the speech was \"outside the realm of Senate behavior\" and \"a very wrong thing to do\". Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: \"I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... And I know the leader didn't lie.\" Cruz alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill; McConnell denied there was any \"deal\", and that denial was what Cruz called a \"lie\". Hatch said McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank. Among Cruz's few close allies in the Senate is Mike Lee of Utah. Cruz has expressed pride in his reputation for having few allies, saying in June 2015 that he has been vilified for fighting \"the Washington cartel\". When Boehner resigned from the House in September 2015, Cruz expressed his concern that before resigning Boehner might have \"cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to fund the Obama administration for the rest of its tenure\". The next month, the budget agreement passed in the House by a vote of 266 to 187, with unanimous support from Democrats and Boehner, lifting the debt ceiling through March 2017. Cruz called the agreement \"complete and utter surrender\". Cruz is one of the Senate Republicans in favor of the \"nuclear option\", \"to speed up consideration of President Trump's nominees\". Changing the Senate's rules to a simple majority vote would \"ensure a quicker pace on Trump's court picks\"."

Cruz faced the Democratic nominee, U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, in the general election. The contest was unusually competitive for an election in Texas, with most polls showing Cruz only slightly ahead.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case or issue an injunction and Pennsylvania's Electoral College votes were cast for Joe Biden. Cruz later led an effort by a group of Republican senators to refuse to count Pennsylvania's Electoral College votes, citing baseless allegations of fraud. Electoral College vote count and storming of the United States Capitol On January 6, 2021, during the debate about whether Congress should accept Arizona's electoral votes, Cruz said that 39 percent of Americans believed the 2020 presidential election was rigged, but that \"I am not arguing for setting aside the result of this election\". Some observers think Cruz knew claims about fraud in the election were inaccurate and that this speech and his earlier statements were attempts to mislead for political gain. There are also concerns that he misrepresented the percentage of those concerned about rigging, with the correct proportion being 28%. Congress's counting of the Electoral College votes was interrupted by an insurrectionist mob that stormed the United States Capitol after a rally near the White House. The attack on the Capitol resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer. When Congress reconvened that evening to continue the count, Cruz voted in support of the objections to Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes. The Senate rejected these objections by 93\u20136 and 92\u20137, respectively. The Texas Democratic Party called on Cruz to resign, saying that his efforts to block Joe Biden's lawful victory empowered the Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol. The Texas Democratic Party also called on the U.S. Department of Justice to open an official investigation into Cruz for inciting sedition and treason. The Houston Chronicle called for Cruz to resign. The San Antonio Express News called for Cruz to be expelled from the Senate. Thousands of lawyers and law students called for him to be disbarred for inciting the insurrection. President-elect Joe Biden and Republican senator Pat Toomey both said Cruz was complicit in the 'big lie' of Trump's allegations of voter fraud. Republican operative Chad Sweet, the chair of Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign, denounced Cruz for \"assault on our democracy.\" Several corporations halted donations to Cruz and other Republicans who voted to overturn the election based on Trump's false claims. Lauren Blair Bianchi, Cruz\u2032s communications director, resigned. On May 28, 2021, Cruz voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the riot. On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the attack, he was recorded on video calling it a \"violent terrorist attack\", which drew sharp criticism from Fox News host Tucker Carlson on his program that night. Cruz appeared on Carlson's program the next night to apologize for that comment as \"frankly dumb\" and \"sloppy.\" The next day CNN reported that Cruz had characterized the attack as terrorism at least 17 times during the preceding year."

Cruz requested that the Houston police escort him and his family through the airport. Cruz left the family poodle Snowflake alone inside the house without heat; reporters saw the dog through the window of the front door of the dark and empty house. Later, a self-identified security guard told a reporter he was caring for the dog. Cruz's political allies and rivals condemned him for leaving Texas during a crisis and traveling internationally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cruz initially said he was taking his daughters on a weeklong vacation from school at their request, in an attempt to be a \"good dad\". Later that day, he returned to Texas, after allowing his family to stay in Mexico, saying that the vacation was a mistake. Protesters calling for his resignation greeted him in front of his house upon his return. After returning from Canc\u00fan, Cruz volunteered in Houston to help with recovery efforts."

On March 14, 2013, he gave the keynote speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington DC. He tied for 7th place in the 2013 CPAC straw poll on March 16, winning 4% of the votes cast. In October 2013, Cruz won the Values Voter Summit presidential straw poll with 42% of the vote. Cruz finished first in two presidential straw polls conducted in 2014 with 30.33% of the vote at the Republican Leadership Conference and 43% of the vote at the Republican Party of Texas state convention. Cruz did speaking events in mid-2013 across Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, all early primary states, leading to further speculation that he was laying the groundwork for a 2016 bid. Legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin described Cruz as the first potential presidential candidate to emphasize originalism as a major national issue. On April 12, 2014, Cruz spoke at the Freedom Summit, an event organized by Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United. The event was attended by several potential presidential candidates. In his speech, Cruz mentioned that Latinos, young people and single mothers are the people most affected by the recession, and that the Republican Party should make outreach efforts to these constituents. He also said that the words \"growth and opportunity\" should be tattooed on the hands of every Republican politician. Cruz delivered one of many State of the Union responses in January 2015. On March 23, 2015, Cruz started his 2016 presidential campaign for the Republican primaries and caucuses, in a morning speech delivered at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. Also, at the same hour, he posted on his Twitter page: \"I'm running for President and I hope to earn your support!\" He was the first major Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 campaign. During the primary campaign, his base of support was mainly among social conservatives, though he had crossover appeal to other factions within his party, including in particular libertarian conservatives. HarperCollins published Cruz's book A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America on June 30, 2015. The book reached the bestseller list of several organizations in its first week of release."

In the Texas primary, he received the most votes in all but six of the state's 254 counties. On March 5, 2016, Cruz won the Kansas and Maine caucuses, giving him six statewide wins. Cruz won his widest margin up to that point in Kansas, where he beat frontrunner Donald Trump by 25 points. With his victories over Trump in Texas, Kansas, and Maine, he established himself as the candidate with the best opportunity to defeat Trump, the leading contender for the nomination. On March 8, 2016, Cruz won the Idaho primary with 45% of vote\u2014defeating Trump by 17% and earning his seventh statewide victory. He placed second in Michigan, Mississippi, and Hawaii. On March 12, 2016, Cruz won the Wyoming county conventions with 67% of the vote and 9 delegates, giving him his eighth statewide win. On March 22, Cruz won the Utah Caucus with 69.2% of the vote, versus John Kasich with 16.8% and Trump with 14%. Because he surpassed the 50% winner-take-all threshold, he won all 40 of Utah's delegates. This win was his ninth. On April 3, 2016, North Dakota elected a slate of delegates dominated by pro-Cruz delegates. Cruz received the support of the majority of the delegates. On April 6, 2016, Cruz won the Wisconsin primary with 48.2% of the vote to Trump's 35.1%. It was Cruz's tenth statewide win. He won 36 of the 42 delegates available in Wisconsin.

On April 16, 2016, Cruz won all 14 of Wyoming's at-large delegates in the state convention. This secured the majority of state delegates, giving Cruz his twelfth state win. On April 27, 2016, Cruz said that, if he were selected as the party's nominee, he would choose former CEO of HP and fellow 2016 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina as his vice-presidential running mate. Shortly after losing overwhelmingly to Trump in the Indiana primary on May 3, 2016, Cruz officially suspended his campaign."

In the months following, several publications noted that Cruz still had not endorsed Trump, Cruz explaining in June that he was \"watching and assessing\" to determine if he would support him in the forthcoming general election. On July 7, after a meeting with Trump, he confirmed that he would speak at the 2016 Republican National Convention. In his speech on July 20, the third day of the convention, Cruz congratulated Trump but did not endorse him. He instead told listeners to \"vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution\". The speech was met with boos and a negative reception among the crowd. The following day at the Texas Republican delegation breakfast, Cruz defended his choice to not endorse Trump: \"I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'\" On September 23, 2016, he publicly endorsed Trump for president. On October 10, following the 2005 audio recording of Trump being released and several Republicans retracting their endorsements, Cruz reaffirmed his support, calling Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \"manifestly unfit to be president\". On November 15, he met with President-elect Trump at Trump Tower in New York City. It had been reported that Trump was considering Cruz for the position of U.S. Attorney General, but the position went to Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions. On November 28, in light of Trump showing a softer tone on his campaign promises, Cruz warned that justified backlash could ensue if he strayed from them.

In 2013, Cruz said that the U.S. had no \"dog in the fight\" during the Syrian Civil War and that its armed forces should not serve as \"al-Qaeda's air force\". In 2014, he criticized the Obama administration: \"The president's foreign policy team utterly missed the threat of ISIS, indeed, was working to arm Syrian rebels that were fighting side by side with ISIS\", calling ISIS \"the face of evil\".

A few days later Allseas suspended the work. In December 2020, the Russian pipelaying ship Akademik Cherskiy continued pipelaying. In January, another pipelayer, Fortuna, joined forces with the Akademik Cherskiy to complete the pipeline. On June 4, 2021, Putin announced that the pipelaying for first line of the Nord Stream 2 was fully completed. On June 10, the pipeline's sections were connected.

He advocates an increase from 65,000 to 325,000 annually in skilled foreign workers entering the United States using H-1B visas. According to McClatchy, Cruz staked out \"hard-right immigration stances\" during his 2016 presidential campaign. Cruz opposes paths to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children (so-called DREAMers). In February 2018, he was the sole senator to oppose a Republican motion to begin debate on legislation intended to resolve the question of what to do with DREAMers. He has called for the repeal of the clause of the 14th amendment that grants citizenship to those born in the United States. He defends the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents, blaming the migrant parents for crossing the U.S. border to seek asylum and claiming that the Obama administration maintained a similar policy. In December 2020, Cruz blocked the Hong Kong People's Freedom and Choice Act, which would give Hong Kongers refugee status, citing the threat of spying by China. He said the law was an attempt by Democrats \"to advance their long-standing goals on changing immigration laws\". During a May 2021 Senate Rules Committee hearing, Cruz falsely asserted that House Democrats had \"designed\" the For The People Act such that it \"directs\" people \"to break the law and register millions of people to vote who are not eligible to vote because they are not United States citizens\" and \"automatically registers to vote anyone who interacts with the government\" regardless of their immigration status. The bill repeatedly states only U.S. citizens would be permitted to register."

Let the election decide. If the Democrats want to replace this nominee, they need to win the election\". In September 2020, less than two months before the next presidential election, Cruz supported an immediate vote on Trump's nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. During Donald Trump's presidency, Cruz and fellow Texas Senator John Cornyn contributed to the appointment of multiple conservative judges to federal courts with jurisdiction over Texas."

Cruz said that the Obama-era implementation of the principle of net neutrality had the \"end result\" of \"less broadband, less innovation, and less freedom for the American consumer\". In December 2017, after the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality, he mocked supporters of net neutrality as \"snowflakes\" who were misled by \"online propaganda\"."

In 2013, he said he wanted marriage to be legally defined as only \"between one man and one woman\", but also said that the legality of same-sex marriage should be left to each state to decide. In 2015, after the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell ruled same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional, he called the decision \"the very definition of tyranny\", accused the court of judicial activism, and said it was \"among the darkest hours of our nation.\" In 2017, the same day that an audio clip resurfaced of Alabama Judge Roy Moore calling Obergefell \"worse\" than the 1857 ruling that upheld slavery, Cruz endorsed Moore for U.S. Senate. Cruz compared the vandalism and destruction of monuments and memorials in the United States to the 2001 destruction of the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan by the Taliban."

She previously worked in the White House for Condoleezza Rice and in New York as an investment banker. Cruz lives in River Oaks, Houston. Cruz has joked, \"I'm Cuban, Irish, and Italian, and yet somehow I ended up Southern Baptist.\" He loves to wear cowboy boots, but he refrained from doing so when arguing before the Rehnquist court. As of 2018, according to OpenSecrets.org, Cruz's net worth was more than $3.1 million. On March 8, 2020, Cruz took a temporary leave of absence from his Senate office due to concerns about his contact with a person infected with COVID-19 at the ACU's Conservative Political Action Conference. Staying at his home in Texas, he avoided contact with colleagues and constituents for 14 days (believed to be the limit of the virus's incubation period). Cruz said he had been advised chances of his contracting the virus were very low."

He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1884 and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Second Artillery. Early in his career he made himself an authority on ordnance. In 1900, then-Captain Lewis was sent by Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin to Europe to study that subject, his report resulting in the re-armament of the field artillery. By successive promotions, he rose to the rank of colonel in the Coast Artillery Corps in August 1913, and was retired the next month for disability incurred in line of duty. In 1911, he refined an original machine gun design of Samuel Maclean and began active marketing of type which came to be known simply as the \"Lewis Gun\", which was used in World War I by the Allied armies, the United States Navy, and the airplanes of the United States and Allies.  Initially the United States Army was not interested in his new gun, but after the British and French had bought more than 100,000 for use in the trenches in France, the US Army did purchase them. He declined the royalties\u2014amounting to at least $1,000,000\u2014on guns made for the United States after it entered the war. His other inventions included a time-interval clock and bell system of signals, a replotting and relocating system for coast batteries, an automatic sight, quick-reading mechanical verniers for use in coast defenses, electric car lighting, and windmill electric lighting systems. He was awarded the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1919. Lewis died of a myocardial infarction at the Lackawanna Railroad terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey, while waiting for a train to his home in Montclair.  He is buried at the West Point Cemetery on the grounds of the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York."

Hammering Man has been installed in various cities around the world.  The largest Hammering Man is in Seoul, Korea and the second largest is in Frankfurt, Germany. Other Hammering Man sculptures are in Basel, Switzerland, Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City, Seattle, Gainesville, FL, Washington, D.C. and Lillestr\u00f8m, Norway. In 1989 developer Harlan Lee commissioned Borofsky's 30-foot-tall Ballerina Clown, a building-mounted kinetic aluminum, steel and fiberglass public art sculpture for a mixed use residential and commercial building in Venice, California in 1989.  The clown sculpture's right leg was motorized with a kicking motion. Tenant complaints followed about the sculpture's mechanical noise and after years of in-operation the kinetic leg component was restored in 2014 to move only intermittently.   Another Ballerina Clown was installed in the Ludwig Forum f\u00fcr Internationale Kunst in Aachen, Germany. This version dates from 1991 and was part of the Metropolis exhibition at Gropiusbau Berlin that year. In 1990, the Newport Harbor Art Museum commissioned Ruby, a 5-foot-tall plastic sculpture containing an internal lighting system and swaying, diamond-shaped light deflectors. Between 1989 and 1999, Borofsky completed a series of Molecule Man public art sculptures consisting of three connected perforated aluminum sheets, ranging in height from 11 feet to 100 feet. Three of his 100-foot Molecule Man sculptures were set directly into the Spree River in Berlin as a commission for German insurance company Allianz. In 2004, the Municipal Art Society of Baltimore commissioned Jonathan Borofsky to create his 51-foot (15.5 m) Male/Female aluminum sculpture as the centerpiece of a re-designed plaza in front of Penn Station to celebrate its 100th anniversary. The sculpture was a gift to the city from the Society. In May 2006, Borofsky's Walking to the Sky was permanently installed on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University near the intersection of Forbes Avenue and Morewood Avenue in Pittsburgh. The piece was temporarily installed at Rockefeller Center during the fall of 2004 and in 2005 at the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas, Texas."

        "content": "Henry Drysdale Dakin FRS (12 March 188010 February 1952) was an English chemist. He was born in London as the youngest of 8 children to a family of steel merchants from Leeds. As a school boy, he conducted water analysis with the Leeds City Analyst. He studied chemistry at the University of Leeds with Julius B. Cohen, and then he worked with Albrecht Kossel on arginase at the University of Heidelberg. He joined Columbia University in 1905, working in the lab of Christian Herter. During his work on amino acids he obtained his PhD from Leeds. In 1905, he was one of the first scientists to successfully synthesise adrenaline in the laboratory (see: History of catecholamine research). In 1914 he went back to England to offer his service with the war effort. Due to a request for a chemist by Alexis Carrel to the Rockefeller Institute, Dakin joined Carrel in 1916 at a temporary hospital in Compi\u00e8gne. There they developed the Carrel\u2013Dakin method of wound treatments. This consisted of intermittently irrigating the wound with Dakin's solution, a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite (the active ingredient in common liquid bleach products) and boric acid.  In the process, he analyzed more than 200 candidate substances, and developed quantitative methods to evaluate their effectiveness for disinfection and wound healing. The solution is still widely used for that purpose, as of 2013. The World War I era Rockefeller War Demonstration Hospital (United States Army Auxiliary Hospital No. 1) was created, in part, to promote the Carrel\u2013Dakin method: \"The war demonstration hospital of the Rockefeller Institute was planned as a school in which to teach military surgeons the principles of and art of applying the Carrel-Dakin treatment.\" After he married the widow of Christian Herter in 1916, he worked in his private laboratory in Scarsdale, New York and had several close collaborations with other scientists. His main working fields were amino acids and enzymes. The extraction of amino acids from hydrolyzed peptides by butanol was invented by him. He also was interested in organic chemistry and synthesis, and devised the Dakin reaction and the Dakin\u2013West reaction. He died shortly after the death of his wife in early 1952."

His popular Concerts Pasdeloup at the Cirque d'hiver, Paris, from 1861 till 1884, had also a great effect in promoting French taste in music, introducing works by Wagner and Schumann, as well as reviving public interest in the symphonies of Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven. In 1868 he founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Oratories to present oratorios, and joined the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique the same year, though he was disappointed there at his lack of popular success in reviving operas like Gluck's Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride.

        "content": "Randall was born August 1, 1926, in Clinton, Custer and Washita County, Oklahoma.  She was known informally as Gene, which was derived from her birth name, Genevieve.  Randall's father, Charles Patrick Roberts (1892-1980), originated from Texas and by 1900, his family moved into Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory, to farm while Charles was young.  The family moved to Seminole, Seminole County, Oklahoma by 1930 where he worked as a garage mechanic then to Shawnee, Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, where he worked as a construction laborer.  The family lived in Shawnee until the start of World War II. Randall's mother, Winnie McMillin (1899-1952), was born in Tennessee and grew up in an Oklahoma farming community as well.  By the age of 20, Winnie was a school teacher in Harris Township, OK. Randall was the third of five children.  Her two older siblings were Juanita and Juarez and her younger siblings were Lahoma and Bobby Lea.  Although her family is of primarily Welsh descent, her father favored names of alternate ethnicity   selecting a few for his children rather than Welsh names, breaking away from family tradition. During World War II, both of Gene's parents were employed as attendants at the Veterans' Administration Hospital in Muskogee, OK. Gene's older brother, Juarez Roberts, was a World War II paratrooper and a graduate from the University of Oklahoma after the war.  He found his niche in Hollywood by writing for several television shows during the 1950s until the early 1960s."

        "content": "Most of Randall's schooling was in the Shawnee public schools. The family moved to Muskogee in 1941 and in 1943 at the age of seventeen, Randall graduated from Muskogee High School.  She enrolled in the University of Oklahoma School of Drama where she studied for one year. After one year of college, Randall moved to Los Angeles with the goal of becoming a movie actress.  Once in Los Angeles, Randall moved in with a college friend of her mother's.  Randall acquired a talent agent who arranged interviews for her with both Mary Pickford, co-founder of United Artists, and Paramount. Although Randall only had some school stage experience, including the lead in the play Claudia at the University of Oklahomas, Pickford offered Randall $125 a week, a considerable amount, to sign with United Artists.  However, Paramount Studios came back with a better offer, which Randall was ready to accept.  But another encounter would steer her away from the generous Paramount offer. Gene's mother's friend was also an acquaintance of the alluring silent film star, Rubye De Remer, which gave Gene the opportunity to meet Rubye and make a marked impression on her as well.  On Gene's behalf, Rubye in turn piqued the interest of director Clarence Brown.  It was early 1945 when MGM and Clarence Brown first embarked on a nationwide casting search for some fresh talent for The Yearling  And now months later, Clarence believed that perhaps the role of Orry Baxter might be suited for Gene.  So Rubye contacted Gene the day after the Paramount offer was made and persuaded her to meet with Clarence at MGM that day.  Despite the fact that MGM newcomer, Jacqueline White, was actually selected and had filmed some scenes that summer, Clarence was still not convinced that she was the right choice. As a result, Gene was called back three times to test for the role and eagerly awaited to hear from the studio each time. This experience earned her a $250 a week, long-term MGM contract which she signed as herself, Gene Roberts. Ultimately, Gene's youthfulness was the deciding factor that prevented MGM from assigning her this lead role.  When production resumed in mid-September 1945, Clarence had chosen 28-year-old Jane Wyman, who was on loan from Warner Brothers, to portray a more mature-looking character with co-star Gregory Peck.  The Yearling was released in May 1947 and went on to win multiple Academy Awards and nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Jane Wyman. Gene remained under contract with MGM for nearly two years and found that there were very few roles for young women her age at that time.  It wasn't until late October 1946 and over a year since Gene first signed on, that she was cast in a small supporting role.  This role placed Gene into the last of Ann Sothern's film series, the final episode entitled Undercover Maisie which was released in May 1947.  Next, she was cast in the low-budget Comet Productions film Stork Bites Man where she co-starred with Jackie Cooper, who had resumed his acting career after returning from the war.  With production completed in early February 1947 and MGM showing no serious interest in her by that spring, Gene asked for and was granted release from her contract.  She then signed once more as herself, Gene Roberts, with 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation but was overlooked by the studio there as well.  After a year had passed, Gene opted out of the 20th Century contract and was on the move again."

        "content": "In mid-June 1948, Universal-International brought Gene aboard with what would become a three-year contract.  Once again, she had no idea if she would be offered any work there either.  Surprisingly, just two days later, she was cast as Helen and filming on the set of Criss Cross with Burt Lancaster, Yvonne De Carlo and Dan Duryea.  This became a significant event that inevitably changed her career potential and her name. Prior to signing with Universal-International, Gene had married a studio musician named Robert Thorpe.  It was the opinion of U-I producers that neither her birth name, Gene Roberts, nor her married name Gene Thorpe (also known as Jean Thorpe), was considered a good fit for her Hollywood identity.  As a new U-I player, Gene was obliged to immediately select a screen name.  Since this occurred during the production of Criss Cross, she was dubbed \"Miss X\" early on by the studio.  The name Meg McClure was first chosen and announced in a press release along with her new  image in a Hollywood fashioned pose set against a giant \"X\".  However, this name was short-lived.  Another young newcomer had already changed her name to M'Liss McClure and attracted gossip column interest with her protests about the competing last name.  Overall, it was reported that the publicity over the name change drew six thousand letters into the studio offering name suggestions.  Before filming ended on the movie, a new name was chosen and Gene would forever be publicly recognized by her screen name, Meg Randall."

        "content": "Tod Dockstader (March 20, 1932 \u2013 February 27, 2015) was an American composer of electronic music, and particularly musique concr\u00e8te. Dockstader was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. He studied painting and film while at the University of Minnesota, before moving to Hollywood in 1955, to become an apprentice film editor. He moved into work as a sound engineer in 1958, and apprenticed at Gotham Recording Studios, where he first started composing. Around this same time he also worked for Terrytoons alongside Gene Deitch. From 1961 to 1962, when Deitch directed thirteen new Tom and Jerry shorts, Dockstader was responsible for creating the unusual, heavily reverberated sound effects heard throughout them; he also wrote the shorts Mouse into Space and Landing Stripling. Dockstader's first record, Eight Electronic Pieces, was released in 1960, and was later used as the soundtrack to Federico Fellini's Fellini Satyricon (1969). He continued to create music throughout the first half of that decade, working principally with tape manipulation effects. In 1966 Owl Records released four albums of his work from this period including what many consider to be Dockstader's masterpiece, Quatermass. He achieved modest recognition and radio play alongside the likes of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Edgard Var\u00e8se, and John Cage. In 1961, he applied to use the facilities at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center and was denied access in separate rejection letters penned by Vladimir Ussachevsky and Milton Babbitt. Ussachevsky\u2019s official reason was the \u201coverstrained\u201d scheduling of the studios, although many suspect that Dockstader\u2019s lack of academic training was a factor in the decision. After leaving Gotham Recording Studios in the late 1960s he formed the audio-visual service Westport Communications Group along with business partner, and former Gotham executive, Fred Hertz. The company focused on corporate clients and produced award-winning educational films for the American Heritage series. Dockstader was also a prolific writer, with several articles published by Electronic Music Review and The Musical Quarterly. In the early 1990s, Starkland re-released most of the content of Dockstader\u2019s out-of-print Owl records, along with previously unreleased material. The two CDs brought new, significant acclaim to the composer. The Washington Post called Dockstader  \"a highly imaginative pioneer,\" and The Wire concluded, \"The obsessive care with which Starkland have compiled these extraordinary recordings should ensure that Dockstader will be remembered as the innovative, visionary figure he undoubtedly was.\" Reinvigorated, Dockstader returned to music at the start of the 21st century, adopting computer composition in favor of tapes. New CDs appeared from Sub Rosa and ReR Megacorp. Work on a documentary about his life, Unlocking Dockstader, was begun in 2011, however lack of funding has stalled the project. He died in Arlington, Massachusetts, on February 27, 2015, at the age of 82. In 2016, Starkland released From the Archives, a CD that premiered 15 works selected from the unexpected discovery of 4,200 sound files found on Dockstader's private computer after his death. Created from 2000-2008, these were among the last pieces composed by Dockstader, before dementia put an end to his studio work."

He was a professor of Latin and Greek at Amherst from 1836\u201347, and Professor of Greek from 1847-93. He was named Professor Emeritus in 1893 (1893\u201397). From 1835-36 he studied theology under Dr. Skinner in New York, and on September 4, 1839 he married Amelia Ogden, daughter of Mason Whiting of New York. They had four sons. He was ordained a minister in North Amherst, Massachusetts on October 16, 1859. He received the honorary DD degree from Harvard University (1857) and two honorary LL.D. degrees from Amherst (1871) and Harvard (1886). He died in Amherst on November 19, 1897. He edited many Greek and Latin texts, and was the author of History of Amherst College During Its First Half Century (1872) and History of Amherst College during the Administration of its First Five Presidents (1894). In the latter he claimed that Amherst was the first U.S. college to use Latin honors, although it appears that Harvard deserves that distinction. William Seymour Tyler was one of the original trustees of Smith College and one of the residential houses on campus, Tyler House, was named after him. Tyler House, a dormitory building at Amherst College, was also named in his honor."

After moving to the United States, Ayre attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, New York, where he participated in multiple sports. In addition to his track & field accomplishments, Ayre was recognized for his outstanding athletic ability in soccer and swimming. Under the coaching of Edward Hector, he was voted the \"1999 High School Athlete of the Year\" after winning the 400-meter title at the Indoor and Outdoor National Scholastic meets. At the age of 18, still considered a Junior athlete(U20), Ayre made his senior debut representing the Jamaica National team in the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay at the 1999 World Indoor Championships in Maebashi, Japan. This team went on to break the Jamaican National Record. Ayre has also won gold medals at the 1999 Junior Pan American Games and has maintained his prominence as the only Jamaican junior athlete to win the 400-meter and 4 x 400-meter relay titles. While enrolled at Auburn University, Ayre quickly established himself as a collegiate sprint talent under the guidance of Ralph Spry, who also coached Auburn alumnus and-400 meter World Champion Avard Moncur. As a freshman, Ayre won the 2000 SEC 400-meter Indoor title and went on to receive the NCAA Freshman of the year honors.

        "content": "Southon was co-founder of The Instruction Set, a Unix training company, in 1984. Other co-founders were Peter Griffiths and Mike Banahan. The company grew to 150 people, then was bought out in 1989 by Hoskyns Group (now part of Capgemini). During the 1990s, he was involved with 17 startup companies, including Riversoft and Micromuse, both of which had public floatations. In 2002, he published The Beermat Entrepreneur with Chris West. This book criticises the approach to entrepreneurship taught in many business schools as excessively corporate, and instead presents a model whereby customers are found as quickly as possible and where formal business planning is only carried out once the entrepreneur is sure of the product and where it fits in the market. The entrepreneur is presented as a specific kind of individual, with strengths and weaknesses (as opposed to models whereby entrepreneurship is seen as a set of behaviours that anyone can carry out). Such a person needs to work with particular individuals at different times in the business' life \u2013 with a small group of expert 'cornerstones' at the start, with a 'dream team' of committed, 'can-do' individuals as the company grows to 25 people, then with more conventional employees after that point. Several other books followed, including two 'Beermat Guides' in sales and finance, and a book for intrapreneurs, The Boardroom Entrepreneur. Southon has written regular columns for the Daily Telegraph, Financial Times (weekly, for four years) and Mail on Sunday. He is now one of the most experienced entrepreneur mentors in the UK, having done face-to-face sessions with over 2,000 people in the last fifteen years. He has also spoken at over 1,000 live events, and interviewed many business celebrities on stage, including Sir Richard Branson at the first International Festival of Business in Liverpool, where he was Entrepreneur in Residence for two years In 2018, a thoroughly revised edition of The Beermat Entrepreneur was published. While maintaining the basic outlines of the 'Beermat' model of business growth, the model has been finessed. In the original book, a five-way equity split between entrepreneur and cornerstones was suggested, but this has been changed. The role of the entrepreneur's supporting 'foil' is discussed. The material on business ethics is expanded. Experiences of entrepreneurs who used the original model (or parts of it) are included, and the marketing section has been updated to discuss social media. Mike is Entrepreneur in Residence at Cass Business School, where he and Chris West teach 'Introduction to Entrpeneurship' and 'Marketing Strategy' to undergraduates in Business Management. Mike's alter ego is Mike Fab-Gere, a 60s and 70s rock star. The band was started in 1991 and for many years was the top draw on the college circuit, then toured No. 1 theatres and still undertakes corporate events. Band members have included musicians from Deep Purple, Iron Maiden and The Zombies. He was also previously the front man and singer for The Oxcentrics, a Dixieland jazz band based in Oxford, in which Chris West also played on drums."

        "content": "Jean E. Sammet (March 23, 1928 \u2013 May 20, 2017) was an American computer scientist who developed the FORMAC programming language in 1962. She was also one of the developers of the influential COBOL programming language. She received her B.A. in Mathematics from Mount Holyoke College in 1948 and her M.A. in Mathematics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1949.  She received an honorary D.Sc. from Mount Holyoke College in 1978. Sammet was employed by Sperry Gyroscope from 1955 to 1958 where she supervised the first scientific programming group.  From 1958 to 1961, she worked for Sylvania as a staff consultant for programming research and a member of the original COBOL group. She joined IBM in 1961  where she developed FORMAC, the first widely used computer language for symbolic manipulation of mathematical formulas. At IBM she researched the use of restricted English as a programming language and the use of natural language for mathematical programs.  She was Programming Technology Planning Manager for the Federal Systems Division from 1968 to 1974, and was appointed Software Technology Manager in 1979. Sammet founded the ACM Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SICSAM) in 1965 and was chair of the Special Interest Group on Programming Languages (SIGPLAN). She was the first female president of the ACM, from 1974 to 1976."

        "content": "Jean E. Sammet was born on March 23, 1928 in New York City. Jean and her sister Helen were born to Harry and Ruth Sammet who were both lawyers. Jean and Helen attended public elementary schools in Manhattan. Sammet had a strong interest in mathematics but was unable to attend the Bronx High School of Science because it did not accept girls. Instead, Sammet attended Julia Richman High School. Sammet chose to enroll at Mount Holyoke College based on the strength of its mathematics program. Sammet majored in mathematics and took education courses, which allowed her to be certified to teach high school mathematics in New York. She minored in political science. After graduating from Mount Holyoke, Sammet pursued graduate studies at the University of Illinois, where she received her MA in 1949. While taking courses toward a Ph.D., she was a teaching assistant in the Mathematics department at the University of Illinois from 1948 to 1951. When Sammet first encountered a computer, in 1949 at the University of Illinois, she was not impressed, considering it an obscene piece of hardware. In 1951 Sammet began looking for a position in education. Sammet was forced to search for positions in New Jersey because New York City was not hiring new teachers. The authorities in New Jersey determined that Sammet was missing two courses from her studies: a course in education and one in the history of New Jersey. Sammet fought this determination, stating that her knowledge of New Jersey history did not strengthen her ability to teach mathematics in high school. This forced Sammet to seek other types of employment."

        "content": "In 1951, Sammet took a position at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as a trainee actuary. She agreed to participate in an in-house training program to learn about punched card accounting machines. Sammet took to the electronic accounting machines, but was unable to work with the machines after her training was complete. She left her position at the insurance office and enrolled at Columbia University to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics. Sammet worked as a teaching assistant at Barnard College during the 1952-1953 school year before she decided that the academic life was not for her. From 1953 to 1958, Sammet was a mathematician for Sperry Gyroscope in New York. She spent time working on mathematical analysis problems for clients and ran an analog computer. Sammet worked on the Department of the Navy\u2019s submarine program during her time there. In early January 1955, Sammet began her life as a programmer. Sperry Gyroscope was working on a digital computer, the Sperry Electronic Digital Automatic Computer (SPEEDAC) and asked Sammet to be their programmer. Her first task was to write the basic loader for the SPEEDAC, which was a 20-line program that took three days to toggle into the computer by hand in binary. Sammet became the group leader of what was called an \u201copen shop\u201d as Sperry began hiring more programmers. The \u201copen shop\u201d consisted of programmers acting as consultants to the engineers and involved scientists who assisted them in writing and testing their routines. The group produced other system software and focused on scientific and engineering computations. In 1955 Sperry Gyroscope and Remington Rand merged and became Sperry Rand. This merger allowed Sammet access to the UNIVAC I computer and Grace Hopper. In fall of 1956, Sammet taught one of the earliest graduate-level courses in computer programming in the Applied Mathematics department of Adelphi College (now University) on Long Island. Despite the fact that Adelphi did not have a computer and few textbooks on programming existed at the time, Sammet was able to instruct two courses for two years. Sammet decided to leave Sperry to work for a company with computers as its focal point. The classified job advertisements at the time were separated by gender and Sammet was unable to find a position for a woman in any field she was interested in so she decided to scan the men\u2019s list and found an engineer position at Sylvania Electric Products in Needham, Massachusetts. Sammet was instead hired to oversee software development for the MOBIDIC project by Carl Hammer, the person responsible for Sylvania\u2019s software development. In 1959, Sammet and five other programmers established much of the design of the influential COBOL programming language, in a proposal written in a span of two weeks that was eventually accepted by Sylvania's U.S. government clients. Sammet published Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals in 1969. The book gives an overview of 120 programming languages being used in the United States as of the late 1960s."

        "content": "Around 1965 or 1966, Sammet noticed a need for the exchange of intellectual information with others working with languages and software while she worked on FORMAC. She was a member of ACM for a number of years but was not active until she became interested in starting a special interest group that would allow her to speak with other professionals in the field. After a couple of failed attempts at contacting the person in charge of Special Interest Groups and Special Interest Committees at ACM, Sammet contacted George Forsythe, president of ACM from 1964 to 1966, who named her Chairperson of the Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation. In order to gain interest in SICSAM, Sammet wrote letters to people she identified through publications and what was happening in the field at that time. She identified people at Bell Labs, Carnegie Mellon, and IBM who were in different divisions and groups. Sammet faced resistance from the interest group on numerical analysis in ACM. Roughly five years after SICSAM formed, there was a conference about mathematical software called SIGNUM. Sammet states that she fought her way to give a paper at SIGNUM because the group was not interested in non-numerical analysis of that kind of an activity. With assistance from those interested in SICSAM, Sammet organized a conference held in March 1966, which was the Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SYMSAM). In June 1966, Tony Oettinger was elected president of ACM and Sammet was elected the Northeast Regional Representative (1966-1968). She was also a member of the ACM Council and ACM lecturer (1967, 1968, and 1972). Bernie Galler was elected president of ACM in 1968 and in August 1968, Sammet became chairperson of the ACM Committee on SIGs and SICs. In 1971 she was elected chair of SIGPLAN. She served one year of a two-year term before resigning because she was elected vice president of ACM in 1972. As chairperson of SIGPLAN, she organized conferences between SIGPLAN and various Special Interest Groups. Sammet has stated that these conferences were organized based on the recognition of how fundamental programming languages were to different aspects within computing. Sammet served as vice president of ACM from June 1972 to June 1974. Working with the president of ACM at the time, Tony Ralston, Sammet made the finances of ACM a priority. At the time of her vice presidency, ACM was almost bankrupt. Sammet convinced Ralston to hold a member-office forum prior to their annual conference. Sammet encouraged this based on her recognition that ACM had no realistic way of communicating with the membership."

He studied at the University of Edinburgh and then undertook postgraduate studies with Edward Gregson at Goldsmiths College, University of London. He holds a PhD in composition. From 1983 until 1986, he lived in New York City, where he worked as a freelance composer/arranger and as a publications editor with the S.A. Music Bureau. Since his return to the U.K., he has worked regularly as an arranger for BBC Television and Radio and has specialised in composition for brass band. Since the publication of Dimensions (1983), he has carved out a niche as an outstanding arranger for brass bands, and a leading figure amongst contemporary band composers. His original compositions, which include The Essence of Time, Montage and Journey to the Centre of the Earth, are performed worldwide and have been selected as test-pieces for National Championships in Australia, New Zealand, North America and across Europe. His music for wind and concert band has been recorded and performed by many of the world\u2019s leading ensembles, including the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra and the Royal Norwegian Navy Band. Harrison's Dream, commissioned by the United States Air Force Band, Washington D.C., won the 2002 American Bandmasters Association Ostwald Award for composition. Commissioned by BMG/RCA Red Label to arrange and compose an album of xylophone music for virtuoso Evelyn Glennie, the resulting recording was nominated as Best Classical Crossover Album at the 1999 Grammy Awards held in Los Angeles. Graham's music for brass has also been arranged for various ensembles, from fanfare orchestras of the Benelux countries to marching bands of the US. The Blue Knights Drum and Bugle Corps\u2019 highest-ranked show to date (a 6th-place finish from their 2000 production entitled Colors of Brass and Percussion) was built entirely around his compositions The Essence of Time and Montage. The 2006 Bands of America Grand National Champions from Broken Arrow High School featured his music Harrison's Dream. Both the Santa Clara Vanguard Drum and Bugle Corps and Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps performed excerpts from Triumph of Time in their 2017 shows (entitled Ouroboros and Metamorph, respectively), while Vanguard performed excerpts from Metropolis 1927 and Journey to the Centre of the Earth in their award-winning championship 2018 show. Graham has held posts as Music Associate with the Black Dyke Band (1997\u20132004), and as composer-in-residence with Her Majesty's Coldstream Guards Band. He lives in Cheshire, England, with his wife and children. He is currently Professor of Composition at the University of Salford, specializing in arranging and composing for the brass and wind band lineup."

He was born at Karlberg Castle, Stockholm on 21 March 1833 and died at Fr\u00f6sundavik near Stockholm on 13 June 1878. He was the son of architect, author and officer  Carl St\u00e5l then Colonel, Swedish Corps of Engineers. He matriculated at Uppsala University in 1853, studying medicine and passing the medico-philosophical examination in 1857. He then turned to entomology and completed his Ph.D. at the University of Jena in 1859. The same year he became assistant to Carl Henrik Boheman in the Zoological department of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, where, in 1867, he was appointed keeper with the title of professor. He made collecting trips in Sweden and throughout Europe and visited other museums including the collection of Johan Christian Fabricius in Kiel. His study of the Fabrician types resulted in his \"Hemiptera Fabriciana\". A significant part of St\u00e5l's work was the study of insects collected from Caffraria, the majority of which were poorly understood at the time. Although St\u00e5l, who was regarded as the world's foremost worker on Hemiptera, published most on this order, he also worked on Orthoptera and to a lesser extent on Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, naming well over 1000 new genera and over 1500 new species over his brief career. In 1869, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences."

        "title": "Stephen Lowe (playwright)_Summary",
        "content": "Stephen Lowe (born December 1947) is an English playwright and director. Lowe's plays have dealt with subjects ranging from the takeover of Tibet by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1959 (Tibetan Inroads) to a dying DH Lawrence trying find a publisher for Lady Chatterley (Empty Bed Blues); from Donald McGill postcards (Cards and Kisses on the Bottom) to Dr John Dee (The Alchemical Wedding).  His best known plays are Touched, about a group of working-class women in Nottingham at the end of the second world war; The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists, about a group of house-painters in 1906 (adapted from the novel by Robert Tressell); and Old Big \u2018Ead in the Spirit of the Man, in which football hero Brian Clough comes back from the dead to inspire a playwright working on his latest play. He has had plays produced by the Royal Court, Royal Shakespeare Company, Riverside Studios, Theatre Royal Stratford East, Hampstead Theatre, Joint Stock; and at regional theatres across the country including Scarborough Theatre in the Round, Sheffield Crucible, Liverpool Playhouse, Derby Playhouse, Birmingham Rep, Salisbury Playhouse and Plymouth Theatre Royal. A two-man adaptation by Townsend Productions of his play The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists toured throughout the country in 2011 to 2013 and again in 2015. Many of his plays were first produced in his home-town at Nottingham Playhouse, at Lakeside Arts Centre or by Lowe\u2019s own company, Meeting Ground Theatre Company.   Lowe moved back to Nottingham in 1985 to start Meeting Ground, with a group including his wife Tanya Myers.  In February 2017, a revival of Touched was staged at Nottingham Playhouse, starring Vicky McClure. This new production celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the original production at the same theatre. Lowe has worked with many leading directors including Bill Alexander, Alan Ayckbourn, Annie Castledine, Jonathan Chadwick, Anthony Clark, Stephen Daldry, Alan Dossor, Richard Eyre, Bill Gaskill, David Leveaux,  and Danny Boyle, who early in his career was assistant director on Lowe\u2019s play Tibetan Inroads.   His theatre and television work has featured actors such as Bruce Alexander, Warren Clarke, George Costigan, Kenneth Cranham, Sharon Duce, Emma Fielding, Brian Glover, Nigel Hawthorne, Bill Paterson, Neil Pearson, Kathryn Pogson, Linus Roache, Colin Tarrant, Marjorie Yates, Harriet Walter and Rachel Weisz. Lowe was writer in residence at Riverside Studios from 1982 to 1984, and he has led numerous theatre and writing workshops, including at the National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, BBC Television, the Arvon Foundation, Liverpool Playhouse, Nottingham Playhouse and Riverside Studios.  He has lectured at Dartington College of Arts, Birmingham University (on the MA in Playwriting Studies programme), Nottingham Trent University, Charles University in Prague and at the Performance Art Academy in Sofia.   Lowe has been a member of various theatre boards and advisory panels, including Great Eastern Stage Company.  He was on the council of Arts Council England, and was Chair of Arts Council England - East Midlands from 2004 to 2010. Lowe's play Touched was joint winner of the George Devine Award in 1977, and he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Nottingham in July 2011. In July 2015, Nottingham Express Transit named one of their new trams \"Stephen Lowe\" in his honour."

The first volume was of plays by British playwrights, including Deborah Levy, Adrian Mitchell, and Lowe himself (Keeping Body and Soul Together).  It was published in 1985 during a period of increased tension towards the end of the Cold War, and Lowe's introduction quoted from Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Nobel acceptance speech, \"we, the inventors of tales, who will believe anything, feel entitled to believe that it is not yet too late to engage in the creation of a utopia of a very different kind.\"  The second volume, published in 1990, came out of the new era of glasnost and a thaw in relations between the two superpowers.  For this volume Lowe selected plays by two American playwrights, Arthur Kopit and Richard Stayton; and by two Russian playwrights, Fyodor Burlatsky, a former adviser to Khrushchev and Gorbachev, and Mikhail Bulgakov."

        "content": "Samuil Osipovich Shatunovsky (; 25 March 1859 \u2013 27 March 1929) was a Russian mathematician. He was born in Velyka Znamianka, Ukraine in a poor Jewish family as the 9th child. He completed secondary education in Kherson, Ukraine; then studied for a year in Rostov, Russia and moved to Saint Petersburg seeking university degree. There he studied in several technical universities. Engineering however did not attract Shatunovsky and he dedicated himself to mathematics, voluntarily attending lectures by Chebyshev. Shatunovsky could not complete any university program due to lack of funds. He later attempted to obtain a university degree in Switzerland, but failed for the same reason. After returning from Switzerland, he lived in small Russian towns, earning by private lessons. In the meantime, he wrote his first mathematical papers and sent some of them to Odessa University. Their quality was acknowledged; Shatunovsky was admitted to the university, received financial support, obtained a degree and was appointed as staff member in 1905. In 1917, he became a professor and continued working at the Odessa University through the rest of his life. Shatunovsky focused on several topics in mathematical analysis and algebra, such as group theory, number theory and geometry. Independently from Hilbert, he developed a similar axiomatic theory and applied it in geometry, algebra, Galois theory and analysis. However, most of his activity was devoted to teaching at Odessa University and writing associated books and study materials. Shatunovsky died in 1929 from stomach cancer two days after his 70th birthday. Despite severe pain associated with his illness, he kept his usual sense of humor and continued to lecture almost until the day he died. He was remembered by his students and colleagues for his original approach to mathematical problems and ability to popularize the most complex mathematical ideas."

Born in Lee, New Hampshire, he was the son of John Fabyan Parrott. He graduated with honors from the United States Military Academy, third of the Class of 1824.  Parrott was assigned to the 3rd U.S. Artillery as a second lieutenant. He remained at West Point as an instructor until 1829, then had garrison duty and served as a staff officer in operations against the Creek Indians early in 1836 before moving to Washington, D.C., in July as Captain of Ordnance. He resigned from the army four months later to become the superintendent the West Point Iron and Cannon Foundry in Cold Spring, New York, with which he would be associated for the remainder of his life. In 1839 he married Mary Kemble, sister of Gouverneur Kemble, founder of the ironworks. While employed at West Point, he and his brother Peter Parrott also assumed management of the operation of the Kemble-owned furnaces in Orange County, New York. The brothers purchased a \u2153 interest in Greenwood Furnace from a minority holder in 1837, and bought it entirely from the Kembles in 1839. In 1860 he produced the Parrott rifle, an innovative rifled cannon which was manufactured in several sizes. The largest weighed 26,000\u00a0lb (11,800\u00a0kg) and fired a projectile that weighed 300\u00a0lb (140\u00a0kg). Parrott guns were extensively employed during the American Civil War by both the Union and Confederate armies. In 1867 Parrott ended his superintendency of the West Point Foundry to concentrate on the ironworks in Orange County. However, he continued to experiment with artillery shells and fuses at West Point until his death at Cold Spring at the age of 73."

On 12 November 2018, the House of Lords Committee for Privileges and Conduct made a recommendation that he be suspended from the House of Lords until June 2022 as a result of a complaint of sexual harassment from Jasvinder Sanghera. On 15 November 2018, by a vote of 101\u201378, the House of Lords referred the matter back to the Committee for Privileges and Conduct on the ground that the Commissioner for Standards had failed to act in accordance with the principles of natural justice and fairness. After the matter was remitted to the Committee, the Senior Deputy Speaker (the Chairman of the Committee) expressed his disappointment at the decision of the House, saying that the Commissioner had \"followed the processes as agreed by the House and that have not been questioned before today.\" The report of the Commissioner for Standards had responded to various criticisms of the fairness of the process. Lester resigned from the House of Lords on 12 December 2018. He said that he lacked the strength or health to continue, after the Committee disagreed with the House's conclusion regarding the fairness of the process and renewed the recommendation of his suspension until June 2022. Notwithstanding his retirement, the House subsequently confirmed the Committee's recommendation. In April 2019, he joined The Independent Group."

It covers a wide range of issues, including etymology, grammar, neologisms, writing style and book reviews. This site explores International English from a British viewpoint. The website features a large database of word-related topics, weird words, articles on word and phrase origins, and answers to questions from site visitors. It also offers a free weekly newsletter, which contains the latest additions to the database one week before they are posted on the website. The time delay allows for newsletter subscribers to respond with additional insights and comments, some of which may be included on the posted articles. On 18 October 2014, Quinion announced that in future his newsletters would be published less frequently because writing a scheduled weekly newsletter had become increasingly arduous. In early 2017, Quinion sent out a message to newsletter subscribers stating that for unspecified personal reasons he was suspending publication of World Wide Words. Then on 4 March 2017, Quinion released to subscribers confirmation that the newsletter would be immediately permanently ended due to his personal circumstances as well as his own changing personal interests. A recurring theme in Quinion's articles is the criticism of false etymology. Such popular etymologies often have the effect of obscuring the true origins of a word or expression by providing a misleading and often unsubstantiated story explaining its origin. Quinion's Port Out, Starboard Home (Ballyhoo, Buckaroo, and Spuds in the US) deals with many such etymologies."

Tiempo, Rene Amper, Peter Bacho, Jose Capili, Maria Cari\u00f1o, and the incomparable Fatima Lim-Wilson are included to remind us all of what reading good poetry, feels like. And read Luis Cabalquinto, Jose Capili, and Ricardo de Ungria carefully. You will be immensely rewarded if you do\". A.R.D.S. Bordado said that Capili\u2019s \u201cThe Great Australian Landscape\u201d and \u201cGorilla Bay\u201d show the Filipino sensibility imbibing foreign geography. The latter poem describes the beauty of the bay: \u201cGastropods on a drift/ conceive enclosures of/ bubbles shimmering forth,/ polished and white among/ rocks, splashing as spring/ time turns supremely aqua/ marine, even less torrential.\u201d Of \"Baguio: The Demise\", critic Ralph Semino Galan writes how Capili utilizes the aftermath of another disaster, the gutted down remains of the Pines Hotel that burned down in 1984, as one of the objective correlatives (\u201cthe turn and flow of stones/ we perceived from childhood/ as walls, doors and ceilings/\u201d) to express the emotional vacuity the personae in his elegiac poem are experiencing years after their major romantic breakup. For Galan, Capili is able to obfuscate the obvious intensity of the emotions that are being stirred by the reunion, for he makes the ex-lovers focus on the physical landscape, rather than the inner turmoil they are feeling in each other\u2019s formerly familiar presence: \u201cthe rustle of leaves/ behaving like music,\u201d \u201cthe landscape of cones/ falling on mountain sleeves,\u201d \u201cpure hemp and other bell-shaped/ things awakening from/ a sudden gush of the wind\u201d. Of A Madness of Birds (1998), Capili's first book, critic Tito Quiling Jr. writes, \"Splattered across its pages are colors such as ceruleans to auburns, and images of falling leaves, cascading water, and stout temple pillars. And spinning in between these are individual\u2019s memories attached to nature\u2019s multifaceted character\u2014from seeing migratory birds returning to their proverbial places to moments illustrating one\u2019s love for his hometown are some of the pieces found in this collection of poems...\""

        "content": "Capili interviewed National Artist Napole\u00f3n Abueva, the \"Father of Modern Philippine Sculpture\". Abueva revealed his personal aesthetics, especially in connection with World War II. Says Abueva: \"We sought the remains of our parents from a field of corpses and items belonging to the members of the resistance group. It was painful for me and my siblings to unearth the soiled white shirt with blue stripes, which belonged to my father. We also found a piece of my mother\u2019s dress as well as her rosary. Later, we found my parents\u2019 bodies and we buried them. It was very painful. As an artist, these experiences taught me to see life in a different way. More specifically, I tried my best to look for new ways of expressing ideas as a way of dealing with the pain\". Capili worked on a research project involving Southeast Asian diaspora writers in Australia at the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University. His stint as a visiting scholar at the National University of Singapore, University of Sydney,  Westerly Centre of the University of Western Australia, University of Melbourne, and the University of Queensland brought about the publication of From the Editors: Migrant Communities and Emerging Australian Literature (2007) and Salu-Salo: In Conversation with Filipinos (2008). In \"The Asian conspiracy: deploying voice/deploying story\", Merlinda Bobis, winner of the Christina Stead Prize for Fiction in the 2016 New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards, writes, \"Migrant story-making has clout if it contributes to the narrative of the nation. This framework is discussed by...Capili in his introduction to Salu-Salo...\". But critic Michael Jacklin of the University of Wollongong, in The Transnational Turn in Australian Literary Studies, commented that while publications on Southeast Asian diaspora writers and every other cultural group that has settled in Australia could be provided for the transnational dimensions of Vietnamese-Australian, Lao-Australian or Philippine-Australian writing, such work frequently remains undocumented by literature infrastructure. \"Literary cultures across Australia will not appreciate works by community-based Southeast Asian diaspora writers\", Capili noted. As Jacklin observes, \"Cheeseman and Capili\u2019s book is yet to appear in Library Australia\u2019s listings; it does appear in the Blacktown City Libraries catalogue\". Similarly, AusLit, the Australian Literature Resource, cited Capili's 'Southeast Asian diaspora writers in Australia and the consequence of community-based initiatives', in which he notes the difficulty of finding an audience for community-based Southeast Asian writers in Australia. In The Politics of Identity and Mimetic Constructions in the Philippine Transnational Experience, Sharon Orig noted that Capili's early work on displacement and reterritorialization in Philippine expatriate poetry in the United States (1993) \"expounds on 'de-territorialization' as a 'displacement,' 'dislocation,' or simply a feeling of 'not being home'\". Hope S. Yu, in \"Memory, Nostalgia and the Filipino Diaspora in the Works of Two Filipina Writers\", added that Capili attributes the migration of many Philippine migrant writers \"mainly to the strong influence America has on its 'neo-colony' as well as the inability of the Philippine government to 'provide its citizens with the most basic material necessities: food, clothing, shelter\"  Capili's interest in migration studies is more evident in Immigrant themes in Japanese-American and Filipino-American poetry (1995) and The Relocalisation of Japanese Immigrants in Davao, Southern Philippines (1996). Arnold Molina Azurin, in The Japanese in our Midst: An Exploratory Analysis of the Experiences of Japanese Migrants/Settlers in the Philippines, and Shun Ohno (\u5927\u91ce \u4fca), in Rethinking Okinawan Diasporas in 'Davaokuo (\uff62\u30c0\u30d0\u30aa\u56fd\uff63\u306e\u6c96\u7e04\u4eba\u793e\u4f1a\u518d\u8003\u3000\uff0d\u672c\u571f\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30ea\u30d4\u30f3\u4eba\u3068\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u3092\u4e2d\u5fc3\u306b\uff0d), noted how Capili described Japan as dura virum nutrix (a hard nurse of men) due to that country's open and shifting hierarchy. Ultimately, for Azurin, Capili suggests that wealth, not blood, was the greater recipient of position [of privilege], and wealth could be created by (war-making) skill or fraud. \"It was a situation where money and contracts, not blood and status, ruled\", Capili asserts. Azurin comments: \"And then, with direct reference to the dire situation in the early 1900s among the common folk in Japan, he (Capili) suggests that 'Japanese emigrants decided to establish settlements in Davao because\u2026[by his own sweat] a person can move up fairly quickly, certainly within a lifetime'\". Migrations and Mediations, Capili\u2019s doctoral dissertation on Southeast Asian writing in Australia, was published by the University of the Philippines Press in 2016. According to Philippine National Artist for Literature Bienvenido Lumbera, the book is  \u201c\u2026 remarkable for its steady grasp of a unifying vision encompassing literary production by writers coming from disparate cultures and historical backgrounds, and establishing their significance as a factor in the construction of the contemporary cultural identity of Australia \u2026 an important contribution to the narrative of Australia\u2019s cultural history \u2026\u201d. For critic Danilo Francisco M. Reyes, the alternative cultural history that Capili proposes would not have been possible if not for his patience in upholding the methodology of oral history\". Says University of Western Australia Professor Michael Pinches, Migrations and Mediations is \u201c\u2026 important and timely: on one hand, identifying and documenting the various factors that have limited, shaped and facilitated the development of Southeast Asian Diaspora writers in Australia; on the other, demonstrating the significant contribution these writers have made to the advancement of multiculturalism in Australia\u2026Capili\u2019s main contribution to the field lies in the way he distinguishes and documents the various programs, institutions, mentors, awards, and communities that have contributed to the growth of Southeast Asian diasporic writing in Australia \u2026\u201d. During a collaborative session between the Southeast Asia/Southeast Asia Diasporic Forum of the Modern Language Association (MLA) and the American Association for Australasian Literary Studies (AAALS) at the January 2020 MLA conference in Seattle, critic Weihsin Gui noted that although there are many studies and anthologies in the social sciences regarding Southeast Asia and Australia, with one exception there has not been a recent substantive study of literary and cultural productions that arise because of such connections. Frequently discussed are works by authors of East Asian and South Asian descent, although there is some attention given to writing by a few authors of Southeast Asian ancestry. Gui and Cheryl Narumi Naruse took their lead for this collaborative session from Capili\u2019s book, which \"makes an important contribution to knowledge about Asian Australian culture and literature, an area that has seen exciting growth and critical debate over the past two decades."

In Originality in the Postcolony: Choreographing the Neoethnic Body of Philippine Ballet, critic Sally A. Ness of the University of California, Riverside noted how Capili identified Agnes Locsin's neoethnic choreographies as a prestigious and technically effective site for what Locsin calls \"Filipinization\", and on more than one level \"the state of the art\" in an internationally oriented project of cultural nationalism. Says Ness: \"Capili recognized this function of Locsin's work, when Ms. Locsin's neoethnic ballet Babalyan was awarded the prestigious Prince Norihito Takamado Award from Japan's Imperial Family in 1994. 'Once and for all', Capili wrote, in a feature article published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, 'Locsin asserted the fact that we are not a nation of domestics and prostitutes'. Spanish novelist and screenwriter Ignacio Mart\u00ednez de Pis\u00f3n's La Filipinas de Amparo Mu\u00f1oz (The Philippines of Amparo Mu\u00f1oz, 2011), published in El Pa\u00eds, referred to Capili's third book, Mabuhay to Beauty (2003), as a starting point to help explain the iconic nature of beauty pageants and luminaries like Miss Universe 1974 Amparo Mu\u00f1oz in the Philippines."

        "content": "John Joseph Egan (9 October 1916 \u2013 19 May 2001) was an American Roman Catholic priest and social activist. After initially studying business at DePaul University, he transferred to Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary, completing his studies under rector Msgr. Reynold Henry Hillenbrand at the University of St. Mary of the Lake.  He promoted racial integration and was one of the clergymen who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches in Alabama.  For many years he was a member of the board of trustees of the Industrial Areas Foundation. Ordained for the Archdiocese of Chicago, Egan worked several years in its inner city. In these early years, Egan was befriended and influenced by Saul Alinsky, an early leader of community organizing and co-founder of the Industrial Areas Foundation. Egan later prevailed upon Alinsky to pen his book Rules for Radicals. Egan accepted a position at the University of Notre Dame, where he founded and directed the Catholic Committee on Urban Ministry, \"a national network of clergy, religious, and lay persons engaged in social ministry\". One Egan's accomplishments of the early seventies was to deliver about 25 non-episcopal leaders of the Catholic Church in the country to a PADRES-sponsored meeting held at the Mexican American Cultural Center (now called the Mexican American Catholic College) in San Antonio, Texas.  The focus of the meeting was to garner greater recognition and respect for the \"Hispanic Agenda\" within the institutions of the Catholic Church in the United States. John Joseph Egan figures prominently in the 2009 book Family Properties: Race, Real Estate, and the Exploitation of Black Urban America by Beryl Satter. The book discusses Egan's work co-founding, then leading, the Contract Buyers League, which fought the discriminatory real estate practice known as \"contract selling\" that was used to exploit newly urbanized black home buyers. The organization United Power for Action and Justice was co-founded by Egan. The Monsignor John J. Egan Office of Urban Education and Community Partnerships, at DePaul University, is named in his honor. Egan's papers are housed in the manuscript collection at the University of Notre Dame Archives."

He was elected president of the Moscow Mathematical Society in 1921, and became director of the Institute for Mechanics and Mathematics at Moscow State University in 1923. He also edited the journal Matematicheskii Sbornik of the Moscow Mathematical Society. However, because of Egorov's stance against the repression of the Russian Orthodox Church, he was dismissed from the Institute in 1929 and publicly rebuked. In 1930 he was arrested and imprisoned as a \"religious sectarian\", and soon after was expelled from the Moscow Mathematical Society. Upon imprisonment, Egorov began a hunger strike until he was taken to the prison hospital, and eventually to the house of fellow mathematician Nikolai Chebotaryov where he died. He was buried in Arskoe Cemetery in Kazan."

        "content": "Keith Dowding is unusual in that he has influentially written in both political philosophy and mainstream empirical political science.  Dowding is best known for his work on 'power', applying insights from formal analysis to central debates on the nature of power and structure of power in society. Expanding on Brian Barry's concept of 'luck' (getting what you want without trying) he argues that some groups of people are 'systematically lucky' in that they are advantaged because of the way society is structured. Such people are not powerful in the sense they have resources that they could use that other groups do not (though they might have this power 'as well') but rather systematically lucky in that they tend to get what they want without having to do anything. Alternatively, other groups are systematically unlucky.  This argument has caused great controversy with critics including Brian Barry, Steven Lukes, Peter Morriss and more recently Andrew Hindmoor. Dowding has also worked extensively on the Tiebout model of individuals moving location to get the local services they require, showing that such moving does occur in the UK though only to a small extent, and that people tend to move 'to' areas for service reasons, but do not decide to leave 'from' areas for those reasons.  He has extended this work into examining Albert Hirschman's 'Exit, Voice and Loyalty' model and has a forthcoming Cambridge University Press book Exits, Voices and Social Investment co-authored with long-time collaborator Peter John extending and applying Hirschman's model to citizen satisfaction with government services. Dowding also considered the theory of presidentialisation of British politics in his 2012 article, \u201cThe Prime Ministerialization of the British Prime Minister\u201d. The article challenges Michael Foley\u2019s theory that British politics is becoming increasingly similar to that of a presidential system. Dowding instead suggests that the British prime minister is gaining power, but only enhancing the responsibilities that he already possesses rather than adopting new powers that are more closely attributed to the United States\u2019 President. More recently his work has examined why UK cabinet ministers resign based on a large dataset of all UK ministerial resignations and non-resignations, and compiled another on Australia.  Following his lead similar datasets are being compiled by scholars all round the world for intensive comparative analysis.  He is now working on a major project examining political careers in Australia."

Karen is two years older than Michelle and was an elite figure skater herself. The Kwan sisters began figure skating at the same time and trained and competed against each other for years. Karen, like Michelle, was coached by Frank Carroll at the Lake Arrowhead training center. Though Karen's results never quite matched Michelle's, she was known for her long legs and arms that added a lyrical style and an elegant dimension to her skating.  She also had consistent triple jumps and good technical spins. Karen also represented the United States at numerous international skating events, and won the bronze medal at the 1996 Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany.  At  tall, Karen stands about  taller than Michelle.  She retired in 1997 to focus on school.  She attended Boston University. Since ending her competitive skating career, Kwan has maintained her connection to the sport. She has worked as a choreographer and is the skating director at the East West Skating Palace, in Artesia, California. The Kwan family owns and operates the rink. Kwan graduated from Boston University in 2000 with a bachelor's degree in communications. She interned with clothing designer Vera Wang (a relative), who is noted for designing figure skating costumes and personally designed Michelle's costumes."

Appleton was a staunch critic of anarcho-communism believing it to be just communism, masquerading as anarchism and viewed those aligned with anarcho-communism to be a war with liberty. Writing under the pseudonym \u2018X\u2019 He would attack the communist anarchist leader Johann Most, decrying him to be a \u201cState Socialist\u201d, posed a question to him of how someone who is of a peaceful stance would be treated if they were to disagree with his economic ideas and claimed that he and his followers wished to destroy all existing institutions and then build their own utopia.

        "content": "Richard Gustave Stern (February 25, 1928 \u2013 January 24, 2013) was an American novelist, short story writer, and educator. Stern was born in New York City on February 25, 1928. He attended the University of North Carolina from which he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude in 1947. After a year working in Indiana, Florida and New York City, he went to Harvard University where he received an MA in English Literature. In 1949, he taught as a Fulbright Scholar in Versailles, France. From 1950 to 1951 he was an assistant professor and taught at Heidelberg University. From 1952 to 1954, he was a member of the Iowa Writer's Workshop and received a PhD from the University of Iowa in 1954. After a year teaching at Connecticut College in New London, he came to the University of Chicago where he taught from 1955 to 2002. He retired as Helen A Regenstein Professor of English and American Literature in 2004. During his tenure at the University of Chicago, Stern was allegedly involved in the \"suppression\" of the \"beat edition\" of the Chicago Review (winter edition of 1958). At the time the Chicago Review was a student/faculty literary publication published by the University of Chicago. The editor then was Irving Rosenthal. The \"beat edition\" of the Review was to include excerpts from Naked Lunch, by William S. Burroughs, and a few Jack Kerouac stories. According to Rosenthal, Stern, along with Joshua Taylor, another faculty member, wanted to suppress the winter issue, being himself \"so quick to protect the administration.\" (For reference to the case of censorship See The Beats, A Literary Reference, by Matt Theado, pp.\u00a0103, 104, 105, under the chapter titled \"The Chicago Review and a Case of Censorship.\") Stern's own account of the \"so-called suppression\" appeared in \"How I Think I Got to Think the Way I Think\" in The Republic of Letters (reprinted in Still on Call, Stern's  \"orderly miscellany\"). It recounts Stern's successful attempt not only to save the review (the University President at the time, Lawrence A. Kimpton, wished to stop funding the journal) but to keep the following issue from dropping any of the pieces (of Naked Lunch and other \"beat\" works) that had been accepted. Rosenthal and Paul Carroll, the Review's co- editors, founded Big Table, using submissions which Stern and the other student editors claimed belonged to the Review. (Oddly, Stern was invited to and did read at a fund-raiser for Big Table and published what he read in its second issue.)  Furthermore, the previous issue of the Review included an excerpt from Naked Lunch along with work by other Beats. In 1960, Stern published his first novel, Golk,  then the novels Europe or Up and Down with Baggish and Schreiber (1961), In Any Case (1962), Stitch (1965), Other Men's Daughters (1973), Natural Shocks (1978), A Father's Words (1986), and Pacific Tremors (2001). There also have been short story collections culminating in his collected stories, Almonds to Zhoof published in 2004, his 21st book. Of this last book, a reviewer in the New Republic called Stern \"the best American author of whom you have never heard.\" This indeed has been the tag associated with Mr. Stern for the last quarter of a century. \"I was a has-been before I'd been a been,\" was a well-known self-deprecation as was the word of Richard Schickel that Mr. Stern \"was almost famous for not being famous\". Stern published another collection of essays, What is What Was, in 2002.  Like his other essay collections, this one demonstrates that his astute observations in fiction are equal to, and derived from, his acute views on news and culture. In 1985, Stern received the Medal of Merit for the Novel, awarded to a novelist every six years by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Among his many other awards was the Heartland Award for the best work of non-fiction which Stern received for his memoir, Sistermony, published in 1995. Stern has been praised by many of the great writers and critics of the last fifty years, among them Anthony Burgess, Flannery O'Connor, Howard Nemerov, Thomas Berger, Hugh Kenner, Sven Birkerts, and Richard Ellmann, as well as his close friends Tom Rogers, Saul Bellow, Donald Justice, and Philip Roth (see Stern's essay \"Glimpse, Encounter, Acquaintance, Friendship\" in Sewanee Review, Winter 2009).  He also enjoyed literary acquaintances and friendships with such figures as Samuel Beckett, Ezra Pound, Robert Lowell, Lillian Hellman, and Jorge Luis Borges.  Some of Stern's students at the University of Chicago went on to become distinguished writers themselves such as Douglas Unger, Robert Coover, Austin Wright, Campbell McGrath, Peter LaSalle, and Alane Rollings, as well as the well-known journalists Seymour Hersh, David Brooks and Mike Taibbi. At 80, Stern continued to write, and his books remain in print through Northwestern University Press and University of Chicago Press.  From 2006 onwards he maintained a blog with The New Republic. The most recent book about Stern and his work was published in 2001: The Writings of Richard Stern: The Education of an Intellectual Everyman, by David Garrett Izzo (McFarland Publishing).  See also James Schiffer's study, Richard Stern, published by Twayne/Macmillan in 1993."

        "content": "On March 1, 2009, the United States Coast Guard reported that a 21-foot fishing boat was missing off the Gulf Coast near Clearwater Pass, Florida.  The boat was carrying four passengers, including Smith; Marquis Cooper, a member of the Oakland Raiders; as well as Nick Schuyler and Will Bleakley, former University of South Florida football players.  The four men left Clearwater Pass on February 28 at 6:30\u00a0a.m. and were expected to return later that night.  The Coast Guard Cutter USCGC Tornado began searching for the missing boat shortly after midnight on March 1, 2009.  By 1:35\u00a0p.m. EST on March 2, 2009, the boat was located, overturned, with Schuyler clinging to it.  The other three passengers were not found.  According to Schuyler, Cooper separated from the group at 5:30 AM, with Smith disappearing about an hour later.  24 hours later, Bleakley became unresponsive, and despite Schuyler giving him CPR, he also disappeared.  Schuyler was found less than six hours later. The search for the three men who remained missing ended at sundown on March 3, 2009.  Friends and relatives organized a private search which was called off several days later. Smith's family has established the Corey D. Smith Memorial Scholarship Fund in his honor. The Detroit Lions held a memorial service for him on March 21, 2009. The Detroit Lions announced they would retire Smith's #93 during the 2009 season in honor of him. An investigation by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission determined that the incident was caused when the vessel was improperly anchored and the boat capsized after one of the passengers tried to throttle forward in an attempt to pry loose the anchor. Smith was named the 2009 recipient of the Detroit Lions/Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association/Pro Football Writers Association's Media-Friendly \"Good Guy\" Award. The Good Guy Award is given yearly to the Detroit Lions player who shows consideration to, and cooperation with the media at all times during the course of the season. His family accepted the award on behalf of the late NFL player."

He was general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers from 2006 through 2014, currently serving as an analyst for the Dodgers studio show on Spectrum SportsNet LA. Before moving to the Dodgers, he was assistant general manager of the San Francisco Giants. Colletti is one of very few American sports executives to work in two major sports: Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League. Colletti graduated from East Leyden High School in Franklin Park, Illinois, and attended Triton College before graduating from Northern Illinois University. He was inducted into the Triton College Sports Hall of Fame in 1993, the same year as Major League players Kirby Puckett, Lance Johnson, and Jeff Reboulet. In 2015, he was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame. In 2021, he is scheduled to be inducted into the Chicago Sports Hall of Fame. In 1982, Colletti began his Major League career with the Chicago Cubs. He was a member of the front office when the Cubs won the National League East in 1984 and 1989. Colletti was honored with Major League Baseball's Robert O. Fishel Award for Public Relations Excellence in 1990. Colletti left the Cubs and joined the front office of the San Francisco Giants in 1994 as director of baseball operations. He was promoted to assistant general manager in October 1996. During his tenure, the Giants had an 813\u2013644 overall record (.558), winning an average of 90.3 games per season. He was hired by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2005. During his tenure with the Dodgers (2005-2014), Colletti had the highest winning percentage of any general manager in the National League. In 2019, Colletti became a professional scout in the Sharks organization."

        "content": "Colletti became the 10th general manager in Los Angeles Dodgers history and the fifth in eight years when he was hired on November 16, 2005. The Dodgers made the playoffs in five of his nine seasons from 2006\u201314. Only once in Colletti's nine seasons did the Dodgers have a losing record. Los Angeles went to the NL Division Series in Colletti's first season in 2006 and reached the National League Championship Series in 2008, 2009, and 2013. The back-to-back appearances in 2008\u201309 marked the first time the Dodgers had reached the NLCS in consecutive years since 1977\u201378. The Dodgers won 15 playoff games from 1989\u20132014. Fourteen of those playoff wins came under Colletti. The only other Dodger postseason win in that period came in the 2004 NL Division Series under then-GM Paul DePodesta. During six of Colletti's nine seasons, the Dodgers set home attendance records. The Dodgers averaged 3,606,151 fans per season in Colletti's nine seasons with the Dodgers. The Dodgers led all of Major League Baseball in home and road attendance in 2013 and led, again, in home attendance in 2014 with 3,782,337 fans. In 2010, under Colletti's leadership, the Dodgers were named Topps Organization of the Year, an honor presented annually to the Major League franchise that has shown most-outstanding performance, depth and talent among its Major and Minor League teams. In the nine seasons from the start of Colletti's career as general manager through 2014, the Dodgers had a 783\u2013674 (.537) record\u2014the third-best record in the National League. Only the Cardinals (.542) and Phillies (.538) were better. Among NL West teams, the Dodgers' record during that stretch was 40 games better than second-best San Francisco Giants. Colletti reached 750 wins as a general manager on July 29, 2014, when the Dodgers defeated the Atlanta Braves 3\u20132 in 10 innings at Dodger Stadium before a crowd of 47,386. Only Buzzie Bavasi reached the 750-win mark faster in Dodger history. His 783 wins from 2006\u201314 were most among all National League general managers. From June to December 2012, Colletti, with the backing of a new, aggressive ownership team led by Dodgers' president Stan Kasten, owners Mark Walter, Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, Peter Guber, and Guggenheim Baseball Management, spent more than $600 million to bring a parade of all-star players and prospects to Los Angeles. The wholesale makeover began in late June when the Dodgers spent $42 million to sign 21-year-old Cuban prospect Yasiel Puig to a six-year deal. On July 25, Colletti brought in former National League batting champion Hanley Ram\u00edrez as the key to a four-player trade with the Miami Marlins. On August 25, 2012, with the Dodgers three games behind the Giants in the National League West and 1\u00bd games out of the final wild card spot, Colletti completed a nine-player trade that the Los Angeles Times called a \"block-buster\" and a \"stunning development\". Key to the deal was the acquisition of four-time All-Star first baseman Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez from the Boston Red Sox. But the Dodgers also obtained the four-time All-Star outfielder Carl Crawford, three-time All-Star pitcher Josh Beckett, and switch-hitting utility infielder Nick Punto. The Red Sox received first baseman James Loney and four prospects, including infielder Iv\u00e1n DeJes\u00fas Jr. and pitcher Allen Webster. The Boston Globe'''s Dan Shaughnessy called it \"the biggest Red Sox trade since Babe Ruth was dealt to the Yankees for cash in 1920\",. After ending the season 86\u201376, but failing to make the playoffs, the Dodgers were active on the free-agent market, signing starting pitchers Zack Greinke, a former Cy Young winner, and Ryu Hyun-jin, who had been an All-Star in each of his seven seasons in the Korea Baseball Organization from 2006\u201312. Greinke, who won the Cy Young with Kansas City in 2009, provided the Dodgers with what MLB.com called \"unprecedented starting pitching depth.\" On October 14, 2014, he was removed from his position as General Manager of the Dodgers after the Dodgers failed to advance to the World Series despite a 2014 opening day payroll more than $30 million higher than any other MLB team, and $55 million higher than any other National League team. Colletti remained with the team in a new position as Senior Adviser to the President. Following his tenure as the Dodgers' GM, Colletti has become an Emmy-winning baseball analyst on SportNet LA, a full-time professor of Sports Management at Pepperdine University, and a best-selling author with release of his memoir, The Big Chair (Penguin Random House)."

Vicki Santo, widow of Cubs' Hall of Fame legend Ron Santo, and Colletti established a foundation RonSantoFoundation.com to place service dogs with people suffering from diabetes. The foundation's 45 dogs are trained to alert their human partners when their blood sugar is low, helping prevent sudden, unexpected onsets of hypoglycemia that can be devastating. Colletti also serves on the Advisory Board of Get Lit\u2013Words Ignite, a non-profit organization committed to providing Los Angeles children with opportunities to develop an appreciation for literature, writing, reading and poetry. From 2011 to 2013, actors Tim Robbins and Helen Mirren worked with Colletti to raise more than $100,000 for the organization. As a California Advisory Board member of Vision To Learn, Colletti works with the organization founded by Austin Beutner to provide eye examinations and free glasses to under-served, urban youth in some of the hardest-to-reach communities.

Young was educated at the Monte Sant' Angelo Mercy College in North Sydney. She studied composition, piano and conducting at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. Commencing in 1983, Young worked at Opera Australia as a r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur under various conductors, including Charles Mackerras, Richard Bonynge, Carlo Felice Cillario and Stuart Challender. Young started her operatic conducting career at the Sydney Opera House in 1985. In 1986 she was the first woman and youngest person to be appointed a resident conductor with Opera Australia. She received an Australia Council grant to study overseas, and was named Young Australian of the Year. In her early years, she was assistant to James Conlon, and Kapellmeister, at the Cologne Opera, and assistant to Daniel Barenboim at the Berlin State Opera and the Bayreuth Festival. From 1998 until 2002, Young was principal conductor of the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra in Norway. From 2001 to 2003, Young was chief conductor of Opera Australia in Sydney. Her contract was not renewed after 2003, with one given reason being the excessive expense of her programming ideas. Young made her first conducting appearance at the Hamburg State Opera in 1996. In May 2003, she was named both chief executive of the Hamburg State Opera and chief conductor of the Philharmoniker Hamburg, posts which she assumed in 2005. In 2006, she became Professor of Music and Theatre at the University of Hamburg. Critics of the magazine Opernwelt selected her in October 2006 as the Dirigentin des Jahres (Conductor of the Year). In December 2011, it was announced that Young would conclude her tenures with both the Hamburg State Opera and the Hamburg Philharmonic after the 2014/2015 season. Young was the first female conductor at the Vienna State Opera in 1993. She conducted the Sydney Symphony Orchestra when they performed Elena Kats-Chernin's \"Deep Sea Dreaming\" at the 2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Sydney. In November 2005, she was the first female conductor to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic. Her discography includes the complete symphonies of Anton Bruckner and the complete Ring Cycle of Richard Wagner, where she was the first female conductor to have recorded either of these cycles. She has also recorded the complete cycle of Brahms' symphonies. In August 2008, Young appeared as part of the judging panel in the reality TV talent show-themed program Maestro on BBC Two.  In December 2012, she was voted Limelight magazine's Music Personality of the Year. In 2013, in commemoration of the bicentenaries for Richard Wagner and for Giuseppe Verdi, Young conducted the entire 'Bayreuth canon' of ten Wagner operas at a festival entitled 'Wagner-Wahn' in Hamburg, along with three rarely performed Giuseppe Verdi operas as a trilogy in September to November \u2013 La battaglia di Legnano, I due Foscari, I Lombardi alla prima crociata.  In March 2016, Young was appointed a member of the board of the European Academy of Music Theatre. Young had first guest-conducted the Sydney Symphony Orchestra (SSO) in 1996.  In December 2019, the SSO announced the appointment of Young as its next chief conductor, effective in 2022, with an initial contract of 3 years.

Akutagawa was the only Japanese composer whose works were officially published in the Soviet Union at that time. His 1950 Music for Symphony Orchestra reflects his love of the music of Shostakovich and Prokofiev. His compositions were influenced by Stravinsky, Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Akira Ifukube. He was popular as a master of ceremonies of TV shows as well. As an educator, he devoted himself to train an amateur orchestra, Shin Kokyo Gakudan (\"The New Symphony Orchestra\"). Almost one year after Akutagawa died, in 1990, the Akutagawa composition award was established in his memory.

Funderburk became a professional lecturer and writer in 1988 and was elected as a Republican to the 104th Congress in 1994, coming in as a part of the Republican Revolution. Funderburk was the first Republican to represent his district since 1901. Funderburk was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to the 105th Congress. His defeat was largely blamed on a car accident in which he was involved. Witnesses claimed that he was driving but then switched seats with his wife."

Born on a farm near Plainview, Nebraska, he graduated from the Plainview High School in 1911 and from Loyola Medical School in Chicago in 1918. He then taught rural school in Plainview from 1911 to 1913. He was a member of the United States Medical Reserve Corps. He was a surgeon and practiced medicine in Kimball, Nebraska from 1919 to 1942. He was also a farmer and the mayor of Kimball in 1933 and 1934. He was a member of the Nebraska unicameral legislature from 1937 to 1941. He ran against Dwight Griswold and lost in the Republican gubernatorial primary of 1940.  Dwight Griswold then went on to become governor of Nebraska. He was the state health director in 1941 and 1942. In 1942 he gave up his medical practices and ran for the Seventy-eighth Congress. He was elected and then was reelected seven times (January 3, 1943 \u2013 January 3, 1959) to represent Nebraska's 4th district in the House of Representatives as a Republican. Miller voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. During his time in the Eighty-third Congress, he was the chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. In 1944 Rep. Miller released private political correspondence he had exchanged with General Douglas MacArthur. Some experts felt it ruined any chance for MacArthur to receive the Republican presidential nomination that year as MacArthur had not intended for his comments to be made public. He authored the Sexual Psychopath Law in 1948 for DC, nicknamed the \u201cMiller Law\u201d, and which made sodomy punishable by twenty years in prison. Additionally those arrested had to undergo psychiatric assessment and if they were regarded as not having control of their (homosexual) sexual impulses then they could be detained indefinitely in the criminal ward of the Washington psychiatric hospital until \u201crecovered\u201d and without recourse first to the courts. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1958 to the Eighty-sixth Congress. He then became the director of the Office of Saline Water in the Department of the Interior from February 1959 to January 1961. He died in Chevy Chase, Maryland, and is buried in Parklawn Cemetery in Rockville, Maryland."

ARDC's significance was primarily that it was the first institutional private equity investment firm that accepted money from sources other than wealthy families although it had several notable investment successes as well. ARDC is credited with the first major venture capital success story when its 1957 investment of $70,000 in Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) would be valued at over $38 million after the company's initial public offering in 1968 (representing a return of over 500 times on its investment and an annualized rate of return of 101%).  Until his death, Doriot remained friends with Ken Olsen, Digital's founder. ARDC continued investing until 1971 with the retirement of Doriot.  In 1972, Doriot merged ARDC with Textron after investing in over 150 companies.  For his role in the founding of ARDC Doriot is often referred to as the \"father of venture capitalism\"."

Daniloff (born December 30, 1934) is an American journalist who graduated from Harvard University and was most prominent in the 1980s for his reporting on the Soviet Union. Being a Moscow correspondent for a U.S. Magazine, Daniloff came to wider international attention on September 2, 1986, after he was arrested in Moscow by the KGB and accused of espionage. On September 7, 1986, Daniloff was notified of a charge and had a proceeding scheduled for 2 pm at Lefortovo Prison in Moscow no other information was known at the time about who or what happened during the proceedings. The Reagan administration took the position that the Soviets had arrested Daniloff without cause, in retaliation for the arrest three days earlier of Gennadi Zakharov, an employee of the Soviet UN Mission. The Soviets initially contended that Daniloff had confidential government documents on him when he was arrested. After intense discussion between the governments, on September 23 Daniloff was allowed to leave the Soviet Union without charges, Zakharov was allowed to leave the U.S. after pleading nolo contendere, and Soviet dissident Yuri Orlov was released to the West. However, the diplomatic crisis did not end there. Expulsions of diplomats and suspected spies escalated to the point that by the end of October 1986, 100 Soviets, including a further 80 suspected Soviet intelligence agents, were expelled by the U.S. The Soviets expelled ten U.S. diplomats and withdrew all 260 of the Russian support staff working for the U.S. embassy in Moscow. Daniloff later contended in his autobiography, Two Lives, One Russia, that he had never held classified documents, and that the KGB had created false information. Daniloff became an instructor at Northeastern University's School of Journalism, and in 1992 he was named director of the school. He was also one of the co-authors of the book The Oath, a biography of Khassan Baiev. Daniloff's grandfather, general Yuri Danilov, was a chief of operations of Russian Imperial Army general-headquarters during World War I."

After becoming head coach of Auburn in 1990, Marsh led the men's team to seven NCAA national championships (1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007) and the women's team to five national championships (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007).  He finished his coaching career at Auburn at the conclusion of the 2007 season, after which he became the Head Elite Coach and CEO of the United States Olympic Committee Center of Excellence with SwimMAC Carolina.  To date, Marsh has led SwimMAC to three consecutive USA club excellence championships, a first for any program, outdistancing the second-place finisher by 12,000 points (see www.usaswimming.org). He was the head swim coach for University of California San Diego, an NCAA Division II program for two seasons from 2017 to 2019.

In 2003 he led both the men's and women's teams to a sweep of the NCAA titles, a first in collegiate Swimming and Diving.  Marsh and the Tigers went on to repeat this accomplishment three more times (2004, 2006, and 2007). Marsh inherited a strong swimming program that was a fixture in the national swimming scene and regularly in the top 20 but was in a slump and turned it into a dynastic powerhouse. Since Marsh took over the Auburn swimming and diving program, Auburn's men finished in the Top 10 every year but his first two years (1991 & 1992 Auburn teams finished 20th and 15th).  In 1990, the year before Marsh came to Auburn, the team failed to qualify any swimmers for the NCAA Division I Championship Meet; in Marsh's first year in 1991, the men's team placed 20th at the championship meet. In 1993 the Tigers finished #6 in the NCAAs and have not fallen out of the top 10 since, with the lowest placing in that time being #7 in 2001.  The women have been equally successful, jumping from #30 in Marsh's first year to #8 in his second of 92.  The lowest finish for the Tiger women since 1992 was #13 in 1995."

Marsh focused his attention on developing an Elite component of the program, for athletes who rise to a world-class level from within the SwimMAC program, as well as those relocating to North Carolina, such as post-graduate and professional swimmers focusing on their Olympic dreams. Marsh stated, \u201cI am thrilled to have had the opportunity to move to Charlotte and join one of the country's premier programs. I have a long history with SwimMAC athletes and have found them to be remarkable individuals. SwimMAC athletes such as Aaron Ciarla, Daniel Slocki, and Catherine Caldwell have been a key part of the championship program we have built at Auburn. I look forward to joining the quality coaching staff at this club and working with the coaches, athletes, and parents to build a championship program in Charlotte.\u201d In 2016 Marsh and Team Elite placed Anthony Ervin, Ryan Lochte, Cammille Adams, Kathleen Baker, Jimmy Feigen, and Katie Meili on the US Olympic Team. In late 2016, the board decided to move forward without Marsh as CEO and agreed to work to redefine his and Team Elite's role at the club. In May 2017, SwimMAC and Marsh announced a mutual parting of ways."

He studied there under the German composers  and Heinrich Werkmeister In 1910, he left Japan for Germany where he enrolled at the Prussian Academy of Arts and learnt composition under Max Bruch and Karl Leopold Wolf and piano under Carl August Heymann-Rheineck, before returning to Japan in late 1913. He travelled to the United States in 1918 for two years. During his stay in Manhattan, New York City, he conducted the temporarily-organized orchestra, members of the New York Philharmonic and the New York Symphony, soon before their amalgamation. Yamada left about 1,600 pieces of music. Especially, songs (Lieder) amount to 700 pieces of music excluding songs for schools, municipalities and companies. They were performed and recorded by many singers which include Kathleen Battle, Ernst Haefliger and Yoshikazu Mera. His opera Kurofune (black ships) is regarded as one of the most famous Japanese operas. His work was also part of the music event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics. As a conductor, Yamada made an effort to introduce many orchestral works to Japan. He was the first performer in Japan of Debussy's Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Symphony No. 9, Gershwin's An American in Paris, Mosolov's Iron Foundry, Sibelius' Finlandia, Shostakovich's Symphony No. 1, Johann Strauss II's An der sch\u00f6nen blauen Donau, and Wagner's Siegfried Idyll.

The provenance also includes W.E. Hill & Sons; Arthur Beare (until 1929); Alfred Oppenheim Corbin (1874\u20131941), a Dutch-born London-then-New-York-investment-banker, amateur violinist, and serious collector of violins (1929 to 1931); Leo Reisman, who purchased it through Emil Herrmann (from 1931); Theodore Pitcairn, a philanthropist who purchased it through Rembert Wurlitzer (around 1953); Brusilow (1959 to 1966), then to its previous owner (name unknown). Brusilow acquired the violin, through an arrangement, from Pitcairn, who, with Brusilow standing at his side at William Moennig & Son in Philadelphia, wrote a check for $28,000.  Moennig, according to Brusilow, \"threw in a Tourte bow for free,\" which Brusilow still owned in the late 1980s.  Brusilow wrote in his 2015 book, Shoot The Conductor: Too Close to Monteux, Szell, and Ormandy, that he also owned a John Dodd bow, and preferred it over the Tourte."

Pomeroy went to Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut and graduated from the Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. He became an associate professor at the same institution in 1912, and was one of the founders of the Williamsburg Hospital, Brooklyn. He was elected President of the Kings County Medical Society in 1916. Pomeroy developed his technique of tubal ligation but never reported or published it. His associates, Bishop and Nelms, presented the procedure and results four years after his death at a medical meeting in 1929 and published it the following year. Its simplicity and effectiveness made the Pomeroy procedure a common choice for female sterilization that is still being used today. The \u201cPomeroy\u201d procedure is performed on each fallopian tube where a knuckle is created, tied with catgut, and the tube at the apex of the knuckle is severed."

The CESifo's website notes that \"Roger Gordon's work has contributed to the understanding of a wide range of economic issues, with a focus on public finance and development economics. His contributions examine, for example, the role of tax policy in the development process, both in general contexts and in the special case of China. His research also focuses on tax policy issues in open economies. In general, many of his papers deal with the effects of taxation on corporate and individual behavior and their implications for tax policy.\""

        "content": "Ahmed began his political career during his student years and was actively involved against the military regime of Ayub Khan. In the 1985 Pakistani general election which was held on non-party basis, he was elected as the member of the National Assembly for the first time from Rawalpindi. In the 1988 Pakistani general election, he was re-elected as the member of the National Assembly for the second time from Rawalpindi on Islamic Democratic Alliance (IDA) ticket. In the 1990 Pakistani general election, he was re-elected as the member of the National Assembly for the third time from Rawalpindi on IDA ticket and became the Minister of Sports. In his tenure Pakistan won the world cup in 1992 under the captaincy of Imran Khan. In the 1993 Pakistani general election, he was re-elected as the member of the National Assembly for the fourth time from Rawalpindi on PML (N) ticket. In the 1997 Pakistani general election, he was re-elected as the member of the National Assembly for the fifth time from Rawalpindi. For the 2002 Pakistani general election, PML-N refused to allot ticket to Ahmed for running in the election. Ahmed was re-elected in the 2002 election as the member of the National Assembly for the sixth time from NA-55 (Rawalpindi) as independent candidate. Later, he joined PML-Q. Since Ahmad was considered a close aide of Pervez Musharraf therefore during his sixth tenure as member of the National Assembly, he was appointed as Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting in the Zafarullah Khan Jamali cabinet in November 2002. As minister for information, Ahmed, on public places, had assumed the role of the spokesman of Pervez Musharraf and advocate of government of Zafarullah Khan Jamali. In May 2006, he was made Federal Minister for Railways. He also served as Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly of Pakistan. In the 2008 Pakistani general election, Ahmed ran for the seat of National Assembly on a Pakistan Muslim League-Q ticket however, lost the election for the first time from both of his Rawalpindi constituencies, NA-55 and NA-56 to PML-N. There were rumours that Ahmed had fled to Spain following the defeat. However, these allegations were later discovered to be false. In an interview, Ahmed said defeat in the election was due to raid on Lal Masjid and that \"he had promised to quit politics after 2008 elections but his defeat had changed his mind.\" He later left PML-Q where he was a senior vice-president and created his own political party Awami Muslim League (AML) and self-appointed himself as president of the party. In February 2010, while Ahmed was preparing to run for the seat of National Assembly in by-election in NA-55, Rawalpindi, he lost the election to Malik Shakeel Awan by an enormous margin .          Ahmed earlier supported President Musharraf's military operation against the militants in Federally Administered Tribal Areas and the Siege of Lal Masjid and has been on the hit list of militants. He was left devastated by this embarrassing loss and was spotted smoking his cigar alone at times . In the 2013 Pakistani general election, Ahmed made an electoral alliance with Imran Khan to support each other in their respective constituencies in the election. It was reported that Ahmed has requested for a merger between his party and the PTI however PTI decided not to go for an alliance with any political party. He was re-elected as the member of the National Assembly for the seventh time from Rawalpindi. In public circles, he is known for making witty remarks and political predictions. He is also known for switching political allegiances from one party to another. In July 2017, he was chosen by the PTI as a candidate for the post of Prime Ministership of Pakistan, following the resignation of outgoing Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after Panama Papers case decision. He secured 33 votes in the 342 seat parliament and was unsuccessful. He was re-elected to the National Assembly as a candidate of AML from Constituency NA-62 (Rawalpindi-VI) in 2018 Pakistani general election. On 18 August, Imran Khan formally announced his federal cabinet structure and Ahmad was named as Minister for Railways. On 20 August 2018, he was sworn in as Federal Minister for Railways in the federal cabinet of Prime Minister Imran Khan. In 2019, as railway minister, Rasheed severed rail transport links between India and Pakistan due to the revocation of special status for Kashmir. In December 2020, in cabinet reshuffle, he was given portfolio of minister for interior."

In 2005, India Today reported that Yasin Malik claimed that Ahmed had run a jihadi camp at Fateh Jung in Punjab, where around 3,500 jihadis were trained. Ahmed denied running such a camp. Later it was reported that Yasin Malik retracted his statements and denied he had ever said that Ahmed running camps. In 2005, during Ahmed's tenure as Minister for Information, he applied for permit to travel to Srinagar, in his personal capacity to visit the graves of his grandparents and meet his relatives in Jammu & Kashmir. However India denied Ahmed's request to travel to Srinagar. In 2012, Ahmed was detained at Houston airport concerning his links with Lashkar-e-Taiba and with Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, an alleged mastermind of 2008 Mumbai attacks. He was released after five hours of interrogation after official protest from Pakistani Ambassador in United States. In 2014, Ahmed was off-loaded from a Toronto bound PIA flight due to non-issuance of clearance by the Canadian authorities. In 2018, Ahmed was accused of hiding 100 kanal (7,562.5 acres) of land from his electoral papers of possessions by Malik Shakeel Awan, Ahmed later confessed he had accidentally forgotten to add the 100 kanal worth of land in his electoral papers of possessions, Ahmed won the case though had confessed to his crime. The decision was accused of being extremely biased towards the Minister and the decision had remained disputed."

Robert Boyd was born in Saltcoats, Ayrshire - one of twin boys.  He was a pupil at Whitgift School and studied at Imperial College (BSc(Eng) 1943) and University College London (PhD 1949; Fellow 1988). His scientific career started at the Admiralty Mining Establishment in 1943 where he worked with some notable scientists, including Harrie Massey who would later encourage Boyd to engage in atmospheric physics research at UCL. His thesis was on New Techniques for the Study of Ionised Gases. In addition to helping create the MSSL, Boyd played an instrumental role in the founding of the European Space Research Organization and its subsequent incarnation the European Space Agency (1974/75). Boyd succeeded Harrie Massey as the chair of the British National Committee for Space Research in 1976. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1969 and was knighted in 1983 in recognition of his services to space science. Boyd was a committed Christian and he saw no conflict but subtle complementarity between science and religion. His 1950s and 1960s writings and lectures on this relationship helped Christians to be more influential in science, through the Research Scientists' Christian Fellowship."

He began the year with the Cardinals, playing in 17 games but batting only .179; he was sent down to Rochester, then traded to the Dodgers on June 15. His hometown team optioned Essegian to Triple-A Spokane for six weeks before recalling him in early August. Essegian responded by batting .304 for the Dodgers in 24 games and helped them win the National League (NL) pennant. Then, during the 1959 World Series, he clubbed his two pinch hit homers; the first, hit in the seventh inning of Game 2 off Bob Shaw, enabled the Dodgers to tie the game 2\u20132 and turn the tide of the World Series. After losing Game 1 to the White Sox 11\u20130, with Essegian's game-tying blast (then Charlie Neal's two-run shot two batters later), Los Angeles went on to win Game 2, 4\u20133, and then capture the world championship in six games. Essegian continued his nomadic career soon after the 1959 Fall Classic, however. After batting only .215 in 52 games for the 1960 Dodgers, he was dealt to the American League (AL), where he had a one-game trial with the Orioles (), two stints (1961; ) with the Athletics, and his most prolonged tenure, 166 games, as a member of the Indians (1961\u2013).

He also has 13 albums out as a composer/leader, with sidemen such as Steve Wilson, Tony Malaby, Ed Jackson, Ellery Eskelin, Tom Rainey, Cameron Brown, Drew Gress, Matt Wilson, Kenny Barron, Victor Lewis, Fred Hopkins, and Billy Hart.  Varner has been in the Down Beat Critics Poll Top Ten annually since the mid-1990s. He has been awarded grants from the Jack Straw Foundation, Seattle's 4Culture,  National Endowment for the Arts, the Chamber Music America/Doris Duke Foundation, and has been a resident at the MacDowell, Blue Mountain Center, and Centrum arts colonies. Varner's first two recordings as a leader were influenced by Ornette Coleman, Steve Lacy, Charles Mingus, Anthony Braxton, and minimalists such as Steve Reich and Philip Glass, and featured Varner's horn with alto sax (Ed Jackson), bass (Fred Hopkins or Ed Schuller) and drums (Billy Hart), with no chordal instrument. His third recording was a more \"straight-ahead\" jazz project, with Kenny Barron, Jim Snidero, Mike Richmond, and Victor Lewis. The fourth project was a Sonny Rollins-influenced trio of horn, bass (Mike Richmond) and drums (Bobby Previte).  From that point (1987) on, most of Varner's work as a leader was for a quintet of horn and two saxes, bass, and drums, with frequent guest artists augmenting the ensembles.  Varner has combined contemporary chamber music with jazz and free improvisation in almost all of his subsequent projects.  His recent work (finished in 2008, released 2009), Heaven and Hell, is for a tentet of three brass, five reeds, and bass and drums. His newest CD, Nine Surprises, is for a nonet of three brass, four reeds, and bass and drums, and was released in Fall 2014. It features Seattle players Mark Taylor, Steve Treseler, Eric Barber, Jim DeJoie, Thomas Marriott, David Marriott, Phil Sparks, and Byron Vannoy. Varner lived in New York City from 1979 to 2005, and now lives in Seattle. He is now Associate Professor of Music at Cornish College of the Arts."

        "content": "Hinde was born in Norwich, the county town of Norfolk, England, on 26 October 1923, to Ernest and Isabella Hinde. Ernest was a medical doctor whose family was independently wealthy through the textile trade; although World War I would impact the textile branch of the Hinde family, Ernest's immediate family unit, which included Robert's older siblings John and Isobel, would remain well-off due to his medical degree. The family had a keen interest in the natural sciences that included long mountainous hikes, which allowed Hinde to develop an interest in birdwatching. At 14, Hinde attended the Oundle School, an all-boys boarding school in the market town of Oundle in Northamptonshire. At Oundle, Hinde was encouraged out of the natural sciences and into the \"harder sciences\", such as chemistry.  Although he would return to the natural sciences, Hinde would later credit this formal training in the physical sciences for shaping the way that he approached his career in zoology, ethology, and psychology."

He had been in the Officers\u2019 Training Corp while at Oundle, and when he was called up in the RAF, Hinde was sent to the Air Crew Receiving Centre in St. John's Wood. While at St. John's Wood, Hinde received word that his brother, John, had been torpedoed off the coast of Africa. Hinde would remain in the RAF for 6 years, rising to the rank of Flight Lieutenant before being given an early release in 1946 for a special exhibition at St. John's College at the University of Cambridge. Throughout his life, Hinde was a staunch defender of peace. During his military service, Hinde viewed war as an unfortunate necessity. However, after the end of World War II, Hinde slowly concluded that the \"preciousness of peace\" was far more important than wartime victory. Through the rest of his life and his career, Hinde was active in a number of war-avoidant groups, including the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs; the group sought to avoid violent conflict by working behind-the-scenes to provide policymakers with relevant accurate scientific information. Specifically, Hinde emphasized the need to distinguish various levels of aggression, from individual conflict to group conflict to world war."

        "content": "Upon leaving the RAF in 1946, Hinde enrolled as an undergraduate at St. John's College, and read chemistry, physiology, and zoology. He received a first in Part II zoology in 1948. While at St. John's, Hinde also served as the secretary for the Cambridge Bird Club; with the help of the British Trust for Ornithology, Hinde was able to publish several papers on the behavior of several species of birds during this time. One such paper, in which he carefully recorded species of tits opening milk jugs left outside, remains a seminal work in social learning. Hinde would later describe interactions with a young David Attenborough in which they would help each other with dissections. In his last year at St. John's, Hinde also met his first wife, Hester, with whom he would have 4 children. In 1948, Hinde accepted a position at Oxford University, studying under David Lack. Although Lack had envisioned Hinde's research to focus on the feeding ecology of jackdaws and rooks, Hinde convinced him to change the research program to pursue study of the great tit.  While Lack was Hinde's official supervisor, and \"was enormously helpful in teaching [Hinde] to be critical and describe selectively and write concisely\", Hinde credited the most major influence on his later work to Niko Tinbergen, who arrived at Oxford in 1950. Tinbergen was on the cusp of becoming a seminal figure in the field of ethology and behavior with his \"four \u2018why\u2019s\u2019 of behavior\", and this allowed Hinde to learn the ethological methods early on and apply them to the rest of his career. Hinde received a D.Phil in 1950; his thesis focused on the annual cycle and behavior of the great tit, and on comparing it to other members of the family Paridae. The thesis marked the first systematic observation and description of the annual behavior of the species."

        "content": "After receiving his D.Phil., Hinde accepted a position from W.H. Thorpe that involved being the curator of a field station location in the village of Madingley. Although the position included a condition that Hinde was not to carry out his own independent research, both Thorpe and Hinde ignored this stipulation. Hinde carried out a variety of research projects in avian species, in the areas of comparative ethology, imprinting, motivation and habituation, and canary nest-building behavior. The nest-building study was particularly interesting, with its interdisciplinary approach that incorporated not only ethological methods, but endocrinological ones as well, by incorporating a study of hormonal influence on nest-building. During his time at Madingley, Hinde developed a collaborative friendship with renowned developmental psychologist John Bowlby. Bowlby was intrigued by the concept of using strict ethological approaches in his observations of children; to that point, developmental psychology had been heavily focused on psychoanalysis and learning theories of mother-infant attachment. Bowlby, through Hinde's ethological influence, developed a socio-emotive attachment theory for which he would later become known. The introduction of strict, objective observational data collection would become a staple of developmental psychology methods. On Hinde's side, the friendship with Bowlby introduced him to psychological theories and ideas about the influence that relationships among individuals can have on observed behavior. Hinde, at Bowlby's invitation, attended a recurring seminar that included psychologists of various fields, exposing him to many ideas of learning theory and analysis."

        "content": "Hinde's interest in mother-infant interactions led to a collaboration with Bowlby to set up a rhesus macaque colony at Madingley. The two agreed that monkey mothers and their offspring would be an acceptable analogue for human mother-infant interactions, and would allow for experimental work to be conducted. In 1958, a building and large outdoor pens were built for six groups of rhesus macaques; four years later, a permanent laboratory space was built. Initial studies at the site focused on documenting the behavior and facial expressions of the macaques, which would aid in individual identification. For this purpose, \"check sheets\" were developed to record behavior at half minute intervals. This type of observational data collection would become a staple method of ethological and behavioral studies, and continues to be used today. Using this type of data collection, Hinde and his colleagues were able to quantitatively record interactions between individuals as well as proximities between individuals, leading to the ability to calculate rates of behaviors as a measurement of the quality of relationship. Hinde and his colleagues also conducted empirical research in the form of separation studies in which mothers were separated from infants in the presence or absence of their larger social group. Such separation studies highlighted the importance of large social contexts and relationships for Hinde; each interaction takes place in the context of prior interactions, so the enduring relationship between individuals is key to understanding behavior. Hinde's careful quantitative ethological approach allowed observers to use their repeated observations to understand the larger social structure of the macaque groups and the relationships that constituted that structure."

        "content": "Hinde's experience working with primates at Madingley led to him being heavily involved in the founding of several field sites for the study of great apes in Africa in the 1960s and 1970s. He worked with Louis Leakey, the founder of many of the sites, and trained many of the young researchers that would become some of the best-known primatologists. For example, Leakey wanted to get formal scientific training for Jane Goodall, who had been working at the site for some years but lacked a bachelor's degree. Hinde agreed to take her on as a PhD student and to handle the bureaucratic issues that would arise from pursuing a Ph.D. without a bachelor's degree but was initially her \"sternest critic until he came to Gombe\". Hinde would visit the site at Gombe several times and would be integral to the introduction of his quantitative recording methods at the site. His work would make the data collected by Goodall and colleagues more objective and more comparable across multiple observers at different time periods; this allowed for the longitudinal data collection that was a hallmark of the site. Hinde also trained Dian Fossey, who studied mountain gorillas at the Virunga field site; Fossey came to Madingley to become Hinde's student before returning to Rwanda. Fossey's work would provide a detailed account of the social behavior and ecology of the gorillas, and she would go on to found the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International to support and drive the conservation of gorilla species. Hinde would collaborate with and train other primatologists working in a variety of species, including Anne Pusey, Richard Wrangham, Sandy Harcourt, Kelly Stewart, Robert Seyfarth, and Dorothy Cheney, among many others. Hinde's supervising emphasized the objective ethological data collection methods that he had popularized in the field through his work with the rhesus macaques at Madingley."

Hinde, along with his second wife, Joan Stephenson-Hinde, conducted research using at-home questionnaires along with playgroup ethological observations to compare an individual child's interactions with his mother and the child's behavior during playgroup; they were able to establish consistency in the child's interactions over time. In addition, the studies established sex differences in the ways that children interacted with their mothers, their teachers, and their peers. Hinde, with colleagues, also conducted cross-cultural studies with similar methods in Cambridge and in Budapest, finding that Hungarian children tended to be more exhibit more masculine features and less feminine features on behavioral measurements."

Hinde retired from Cambridge in 1994, but continued to write extensively on ideas of religion and morality. One of his major arguments concerned the components of religions (for instance, beliefs, ritual, values, and sociality) and whether the nature of these components could be understood using traditional biological principles. Hinde's own views were summarized when he said, \"\u2018it does not matter too much what you believe, for many different cultural beliefs bring meaning to believers\u2019 lives (though differences in religious beliefs can lead to horrendous conflict). But what does matter is how people behave.\" He also hypothesized about the evolution of pro-social groups, saying that groups in which members behave pro-socially and cooperate are most successful despite the conflict between the self and the group that's introduced by pro-sociality. He argued that this conflict was managed by what is commonly called morality."

His antics earned him the moniker \"The Madman from Mississippi.\" He hit .300 or better in five of his first seven seasons. Though regularly among the league leaders in stolen bases, he could also be inattentive and overzealous on the basepaths. He once tried to steal a base during an intentional walk. In the 1934 World Series, he was picked off first while arguing with the Cardinal bench.  Earlier that year, on June 30, he was picked off base twice in the same inning. After Hank Greenberg singled, Walker reached on an error but was caught off base when the catcher threw to first. Greenberg tried to draw a throw by running to third base and was thrown out, with Walker taking second base. Moments later, with Walker standing six feet off the bag, the pitcher threw to second base and Walker was tagged out. Detroit manager Mickey Cochrane was so angered by Walker's inattention that he suspended Walker for 10 days and fined him $20. In 1936, Walker hit .353 \u2014 the highest batting average of his career and 6th highest in the American League.  He also hit 55 doubles \u2014 second only to his teammate Charlie Gehringer. In 1937, Walker began the season on fire. On Opening Day, he hit for the cycle \u2014 the only player to accomplish that feat on Opening Day. He did it in reverse order (called an \"unnatural cycle\") \u2013 starting with a home run, followed by triple, then a double and finally a single. He continued his hot hitting with a 27-game streak in April and May, and his fast start put him in the 1937 All-Star Game, although he did not appear in the game. He ended 1937 with a career-high 18 HR, 113 RBIs and .335 average. Despite Walker's strong performance that year, the Tigers (reportedly unhappy with his antics) traded him after the season. They sent two of their most popular players, Walker and Marv Owen, to the White Sox for Vern Kennedy, Tony Piet and Dixie Walker. The trade caused an uproar with Tiger fans, and owner Walter Briggs was forced to issue an announcement from his Miami home that \"the deal was made with my approval.\" Walker continued to hit well for several years afterward, but was traded four more times. In December 1939, he was traded to the Washington Senators for Pete Appleton and Taffy Wright. In December 1940, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Doc Cramer and then sent to the Cleveland Indians. While playing for the Cincinnati Reds in 1942, in the second game of a doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals on May 30, Walker collided in the outfield with fellow Mississippi native Harry Craft, and both were unable to finish the game. Their injuries led to the major league debut of Clyde Vollmer the next day."

Fox staved off the internal challenge and faced Hoeffel in a rematch for the general election.  Fox also faced a backlash after the impeachment of President Clinton; the 13th, long a classic \"Yankee Republican\" district, had become increasingly friendly to Democrats in the 1990s. In November, Fox was unable to overcome these challenges and lost 51.6%\u201346.6%.  After the election, Fox voted for all four articles of impeachment against Clinton. In 2004, State Representative Ellen Bard, who held Fox' old state house seat retired to run for Congress, and Fox was persuaded to run for the seat. Fox faced newcomer Josh Shapiro in a district that had become increasingly favorable to Democrats since his original tenure. His campaign did not gain traction with the electorate, and he was defeated 54.3%\u201344.7%."

        "content": "Bagot began work as a temporary registry clerk with the Metropolitan Police Special Branch in 1929, at the age of 22. She entered the Ministry of Defence from Scotland Yard as a secretary in 1931, when her section was transferred to MI5. The move resulted in a forced significant pay cut of \u00a38 a year, a not inconsiderable sum at the time. She went on to work for both MI5 and MI6. During her long career Bagot became one of the security service's principal experts on Soviet Communism. She was the first person to warn MI5 that Kim Philby, MI6 officer and Soviet KGB double agent, had been a member of the Communist party.  Philby's denial of this fact led to his eventual resignation from MI6, and his flight to Moscow. Bagot also wrote a definitive account of the 1924 Zinoviev Affair in which a forged letter purported to be from Grigory Zinoviev, president of the executive committee of the Comintern, urged the British working class to rise up in an armed insurrection. The publication of the letter is thought by some to have had an effect on the subsequent electoral defeat of the Ramsay MacDonald-led Labour Government. It has also been suggested that MI5 or MI6 may have been involved in leaking the forged letter. During the Second World War Bagot worked as a clerk in the Registry and the counter subversion section, at Wormwood Scrubs and later at Blenheim Palace. She later spent time in the Middle East advising on how to counter Soviet subversion to British authorities in the area. By the late 1940s she was recognised as a leading expert on Soviet Communism. Her knowledge was supposed to have impressed J Edgar Hoover. In 1949 she was promoted to officer. In 1953 Bagot became the first female intelligence officer in MI5 to reach the rank of Assistant Director, taking charge of an Overseas Branch section. She retired in 1967."

After attending Upper Canada College he began his engineering training by working on the Erie Canal and continued his learning experience later on the Welland Canal. He became well known for his writings, particularly Philosophy of Railroads and The Canals of Canada: Their Prospects and Influence, and surveyed a railway connecting Kingston, Ontario, and Toronto (1851), was in charge of the survey for a line between Montreal and Kingston, and determined the site for the Victoria Bridge that crosses the St. Lawrence River into Montreal. However, his engineering focus was on water supply. He became chief engineer of the Montreal Water Board and also built the Ottawa Water Works. One of his best-known achievements was the construction of the Hamilton Waterworks, an achievement commemorated by the preservation of the pumping station as the Hamilton Museum of Steam and Technology. His design for the foundations of the Victoria Bridge (\u201cKeefer\u2019s Shoes\u201d) was used in the construction of the bridge. Keefer was a co-founder and the first president of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers. He was also president of the American Society of Civil Engineers (1888) and of the Canadian Institute. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1890 and was its president from 1898 to 1899. He served as chief engineer of the Montreal Water Board and designed the water-supply system for Hamilton, Ontario (1859), as well as the waterworks in Ottawa (1874). His Hamilton pumping station, with its working Gartshore beam engines, has been declared a national historic site. As the \"Dean of Canadian engineers,\" he received many honours, including the presidency of the American Society of Civil Engineers. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and an officer of the French Legion of Honour. He died in Ottawa in 1915. His son, Charles Keefer, was also a notable Canadian civil engineer. The Keefer Medal was established in 1942, and is awarded annually by the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering for the best civil engineering paper in hydro-technical, transportation or environmental engineering."

After serving in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, he started as a production manager at NBC in 1945. Coe made his mark in the early years of network television when Lights Out moved from radio to TV on July 3, 1946. Variety reviewed: Credit for the show's all-around excellence belongs jointly to scripter Wyllis Cooper and producer Fred Coe. Cooper was the last writer of the radio version with an eight-week series on the NBC net last summer. (Show returns for eight weeks Sat. (6) as replacement for Judy Canova). He followed Arch Oboler at the task and has made the switch from radio to tele without a single letdown in the program's eerie quality. Coe, whose light on NBC television has been partly hidden in the past by Ed Sobol and Ernie Colling, both of whom won ATS awards this last year, has come into his own with this show and should now rank right at the top of the heap. Story, titled First Person Singular, concerned a psychopathic killer whose wife's constant nagging, extreme sloppiness, etc., led him to strangle her in their apartment on one of those blistering summer evenings. Killer was never seen, with the camera following the action and taking in just what the eyes of the murderer would see. Thoughts in the killer's subconscious, meanwhile, told what might go on in the mind of such a person as he contemplates his crime, is convicted in court and then hanged. Coe achieved some admirable effects with the camera, drawing the viewer both into the killer's mind and into the action. Use of a spiral montage effect bridged the gap between scenes very well and the integration of film to point up the killer's dream of a cool, placid existence and to heighten the shock effect as the hangman ended his life was excellent. Technical director Bill States was on the beam with the controls in following Coe's direction."

In 1987 Plummer won the Surf Race Championship of Australia at Scarborough Beach, WA. While representing the Australian National Surf Life Saving Team in 1988, he was crowned World Surf Race Champion at the 1988 World Surf Lifesaving Championships held in Southport, Queensland. At the age of 20, he moved to America where he studied at Stanford University. He graduated in 1992 with Bachelor of Arts in psychology. He earned an MBA from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1998. Plummer was recently referred to in a controversy involving long-time Stanford swimming coach Skip Kenney, as Kenney was suspended indefinitely by Stanford on 9 March 2007 after admitting to deleting from the team media guide the records of Plummer and four other former Stanford swimmers with whom Kenney had disagreements. When asked for comment by the media, Plummer appeared to indicate that he opined that Kenney should be fired. He resided in Texas with his wife and beloved children. Plummer sold luxury real estate in the Southlake and Westlake areas of Dallas Fort Worth in the United States. He died on 15 November 2021, at the age of 52."

Though he had led in the primary, which included a third candidate, former State Representative Ben F. Holt of Rapides Parish, McSween lost the 1960 Democratic congressional runoff primary to former Governor Earl Long. Long died a few days later, and the Democratic State Central Committee, of which Holt was a member, certified McSween the nominee for the November 8 election. In that Republicans failed to offer a candidate, McSween was in the enviable but unlikely position of being unopposed for reelection even after having been denied renomination. Oddly, McSween in effect lost his primary but won his general election without opposition. On January 31, 1961, McSween joined a slim 217\u2013212 majority to increase the size of the House Rules Committee to permit then Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas to add newer, more liberal members to the panel, which controls the flow of legislation in the chamber. This vote, also cast by McSween's colleague from Shreveport, Overton Brooks, angered conservatives in both parties. The enlargement of the committee led to passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which struck down segregation in most situations in the United States. In 1962, Gillis William Long unseated McSween in the Democratic primary. Long's views and voting record were virtually identical to those of McSween.

An immunologist, he was the co-discoverer, with Peter Medawar and Rupert Billingham, of acquired immunological tolerance. They injected cells from donor mice into fetal mice, and later neonatal mice, which would as adults receive donor skin grafts without rejection. Brent was born Lothar Baruch, in K\u00f6slin, Germany (now Koszalin, Poland), to German Jewish parents, Charlotte (Rosenthal) and Arthur Baruch. To avoid persecution in the largely non-Jewish K\u00f6slin, his family placed him in the Jewish Orphanage Berlin-Pankow in Berlin in 1936. In 1938, at age 13, to escape the rising anti-Semitism of the Sturmabteilung (Storm Troopers) and teachers, Brent was sent to England on the first of the Kindertransports and became a pupil at Anna Essinger's Bunce Court School. His parents and older sister stayed behind in Germany. Because his status as a German national would have made him liable to execution in the event of capture, he was advised to change his name. After the war, he found out that his parents were sent to Riga, Latvia, and executed. There are three stolpersteine for his parents and sister in Berlin. After the war, he became a British citizen and enrolled at University of Birmingham where he was president of the Guild of Undergraduates in 1950\u20131951. He received his Ph.D. at University College London. As a secular Jew who escaped the Holocaust, Brent was highly critical of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. In 2012 he was interviewed and filmed for the documentary The Essential Link: The Story of Wilfrid Israel by Yonatan Nir, in which he talked about his Kindertransport experience. He was a member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts and an honorary member of the British Society for Immunology. Brent died in December 2019, at the age of 94. He was posthumously appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to Holocaust education."

He was awarded the Fred Keesling Award following his high school career. He attended Ohio State University, where he completed a successful collegiate career. He won seven individual titles, including the 1990 Big Ten Championship, the 1991 Robert Kepler Intercollegiate and 5 other events. He was a four-time All-Conference selection in the Big Ten from 1988 to 1991; his other Big Ten Awards include the 1988 Freshman of the Year, the 1990 Player of the Year and the 1990 Les Bolstad Award for lowest stroke average.

In 1997 he was named the Nike Tour Player of the Year and also led the money list. Smith has won one tournament on the PGA Tour, the 2002 Buick Classic. Smith struggled on the PGA Tour after the win. Smith's best result on the PGA Tour since his sole win in 2002 was when he finished 3rd place at the 2004 Chrysler Classic of Greensboro. On June 21, 2009, Smith's wife was killed in an automobile accident. His two children were also critically injured. In 2013 Smith was inducted into the Indiana Golf Hall Of Fame and has been quite successful in the Indiana Golf Association. In 2018 Smith collected another professional win in the Indiana PGA Indianapolis Open. Smith held a share of the 54-hole lead at the 2015 Puerto Rico Open, but stumbled with a final-round 73 to finish T10. It was his first PGA Tour top-10 in ten years."

After attending The Hotchkiss School, he graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in comparative literature from Hamilton College in 1985.  Finch then pursued an M.F.A. in sculpture from the Rhode Island School of Design, graduating in 1989. The first retrospective of his work, which ended in March 2008, was assembled at MASS MoCA in North Adams, MA. He currently lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. Finch produces work in a wide variety of mediums, including watercolor, photography, glass, electronics, video and fluorescent lights. He is perhaps best known for dealing with the elusive concepts of memory and perception through light installations. After measuring with a colorimeter the light that exist naturally in a specific place and time, Finch's re-constructs the luminosity of the location through artificial means. For example, Moonlight (Luna County, New Mexico, July 13, 2003), replicates the exact light of the full moon that shone over the desert of Luna County, New Mexico on the evening of July 13, 2003. Creative Time, Friends of the High Line, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation commissioned The River That Flows Both Ways to Spencer Finch as the inaugural art installation for the High Line Park. The work is integrated into the window bays of the former Nabisco Factory loading dock, as a series of 700 purple and grey colored glass panes. Each color is exactly calibrated to match the center pixel of 700 digital pictures, one taken every minute, of the Hudson River, therefore presenting an extended portrait of the river that gives the work its name.  Creative Time worked with the artist to realize the site-specific concept that emerged when he saw the rusted, disused mullions of the old factory, which metal and glass specialists Jaroff Design helped to prepare and reinstall. Finch was chosen to create the only work of art commissioned for the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.  For his work, \"Trying To Remember the Color of the Sky on That September Morning,\" Finch hand-painted 2,983 squares of Fabriano paper \u2014 one square in a unique shade of blue for every person killed in the September 11 attacks and in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center."

According to research  published by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, Gompert was educated at Adelphi Academy, Pratt Institute, and the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. The Landmarks Commission report on Gompert was included in its study of its decision to grant landmark status to the building that once housed The High School of Music & Art. It states: \"After employment in the firms of McKim, Mead & White, Maynicke & Franke, and George Edward Harding & Gooch, he established his own practice around 1906 and specialized in the design of commercial and institutional buildings. He was elected president of the Brooklyn chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1923. Gompert was hired in February 1923 by the New York City Board of Education as an expert to assist in the reorganization of the Bureau of Construction and Maintenance and to facilitate the construction of public schools; his initial six-month contract gave him the 'powers and duties of Superintendent of School Buildings.' \"According to The New York Times, Gompert had 'much experience in the directing of large building construction enterprises.' After a six-month extension of his contract, Gompert was appointed in January 1924 to the position of Architect and Superintendent of School Buildings for the Board of Education, and became the third-highest paid official in the administration of Mayor John Francis Hylan. \"Gompert was the first successor to the noted Charles B.J. Snyder, Superintendent of School Buildings from 1891 until January 1, 1923, who had been responsible for the vast school construction program following the consolidation of New York City in 1898, and had been 'virtually forced out of the post under pressure by. . . Mayor Hylan.' \"To alleviate the serious overcrowding in the schools caused by immigration after World War I, New York City undertook another extensive program of school construction in the mid-1920s. Gompert was forced to contend with a significant shortage of bricklayers in the citywide building industry, as well as a lack of interest on the part of major construction firms in bidding on public school construction projects. He attempted to bring about economy and change in the process of school construction, including standardizing design and construction, employing general contracts instead of individual construction contracts, and instituting double shifts to shorten construction time. In 1925, however, charges began to surface, first by a mayoral candidate, that many of the schools constructed under Gompert were defective. By the end of 1927, three separate investigations were underway and Gompert resigned in December. Former Mayor Hylan responded to critics that Gompert was under attack because he had 'built too many schools to suit those that do not want the"

Rodney was a lawyer who fought successfully for equal pay for women before the Minnesota Supreme Court. Mildred was a member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, and Marvin consecrated as a \"White Ribbon Baby\" who did not taste \"demon rum\" until he was 25 and halfway through graduate school. A case of polio when he was six years old proved to be non-paralytic, but he (and his mother) were quarantined for some time. In high school, he ran track, played intramural basketball, acted in school plays and played clarinet in the school marching band. After high school graduation in 1944, he joined the US Marine Corps (following his father who had served as a Marine in World War I before becoming a lawyer). Despite color blindness he was enrolled in an officer training program and sent to the University of California, Berkeley. At war's end, he returned to Minnesota and with the help of the GI Bill, graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in Chemical Engineering in 1948. He worked as a chemist for some years but found it unfulfilling. Intending to enter law school and join father's practice, he found a job counseling engineering students on probation which required that he enroll in a course in vocational and occupational therapy with Donald G. Paterson (1892-1961). He fell in love with psychology, abandoned his legal studies and earned a Ph.D. in Industrial Psychology in 1954 by developing the Minnesota Engineering Analogies Test as his doctoral dissertation requirement. This test was published and marketed by the Psychological Corporation, now Harcourt Assessment that same year."

His principle finding in all three projects was that, even in autonomous tests, results depended on who administered the survey. During five productive years at 3M Company as Manager of Employee Relations Research, he conducted research and published widely. When his University of Minnesota mentor D.G. Paterson retired, Dunnette was invited to the post of Associate Professor to take the Industrial Psychology part of Patterson's work, leaving Counseling Psychology and Differential Psychology to other of Patterson's 83 former PhD Students, as part of a plan agreed by the university's Department of Psychology prior to his joining 3M. In 1966/7, he was President of the Industrial Psychology section of the American Psychological Association.  In 1967, Dunnette co-founded Personnel Decisions Inc., and eight years later, cofounded a nonprofit organization, Personnel Decisions Research Institute (now a for-profit operation). In addition to 3M, his clients included IBM, Honeywell, Sears, Caterpillar, Ford Motor Company, Office of Naval Research, US Marine Corps, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, the National Institute on Drug Abuse and others. He published over 65 articles, chapters and books. Perhaps his best known book is the Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology published in 1976 by Rand McNally. In 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on \u201cMainstream Science on Intelligence,\u201d a public statement written by Linda Gottfredson, published in response to popular criticism of the conclusions presented in the controversial book The Bell Curve."

He was the Court Mathematician of John III Sobieski. Kocha\u0144ski was born in Dobrzy\u0144 nad Wis\u0142\u0105. He began his education in Toru\u0144, and in 1652 he entered the Society of Jesus in Vilnius. He studied philosophy at Vilnius University (then called Vilnius Academy). He also studied mathematics, physics and theology. He went on to lecture on those subjects at several European universities: in Florence, Prague, Olomouc, Wroc\u0142aw, Mainz and W\u00fcrzburg. In 1680 he accepted an offer from John III Sobieski, the king of Poland, returning to Poland and taking the position of the king's chaplain, mathematician, clock maker, librarian, and tutor of the king's son, Jakub. He wrote many scientific papers, mainly on mathematics and mechanics, but also on physics, astronomy and philosophy. The best known of his works, Observationes Cyclometricae ad facilitandam Praxin accommodatae, is devoted to the squaring the circle (or alternatively, the quadrature of the circle) and was published in 1685 in the leading scientific periodical of the time, Acta Eruditorum. He also found a famous approximation of \u03c0 today called Kocha\u0144ski's approximation: Kocha\u0144ski cooperated and corresponded with many scientists, Johannes Hevelius and Gottfried Leibniz among them. He was apparently the only one of the contemporary Poles to know elements of the newly invented calculus. As a mechanic he was a renowned clock maker. He suggested replacing the clock's pendulum with a spring, and standardizing the number of escapements per hour. He died in Teplice in Bohemia."

Her paternal great-grandfather was Richard Wagner, and she is also the great-great\u2011granddaughter of Franz Liszt. She grew up in Wahnfried, Bayreuth, until her father's death in 1966, whereupon her uncle Wolfgang Wagner had the house measured and asked her widowed mother to pay rent. She studied musicology, literature and theatre in Berlin, and holds a Ph.D. from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, obtained in 1980 under the direction of Erich Heller. She is the author of several important books on a variety of subjects, which include Karl Kraus (Geist und Geschlecht: Karl Kraus und die Erotik der Wiener Moderne, Frankfurt am\u00a0Main, Suhrkamp, 1982 \u2014 a work based on her doctoral dissertation) and the Wagner family (The\u00a0Wagners: The\u00a0Dramas of a Musical Dynasty, Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton University Press, 2001).  Her article questioning the propriety of public subsidies given to high-profile cultural events in general, and the Bayreuth Festival in particular (at present c. US$6.5\u00a0million annually), Im Fadenkreuz der Kulturpolitik, published in the July\u00a02006 issue of Cicero: Magazin f\u00fcr politische Kultur, engendered controversy within Germany. In 1999 Wagner became a member of the Deutsche Akademie f\u00fcr Sprache und Dichtung, and has served as its vice president since 2011. In 2001, she made a bid for directorship of the Bayreuth Festival, together with G\u00e9rard Mortier, who had changed the Salzburg Festival, but did not expect to win. In 2004, Wagner became the director of the , which she named P\u00e8lerinages in honour of Liszt.  She stood down from the post in September 2013. In 2013, she was named the director of the Beethovenfest, and assumed this post in January 2014. She has recognized Wagner's relation to Beethoven, who modeled his first composition on Beethoven's works. She focused less on Beethoven's symphonies, but presented more chamber music, often in contrast with contemporary works in the genre."

Boltwood attended Yale University, became a professor there and in 1910 was appointed chair of the first academic department of radiochemistry. He established that lead was the final decay product of uranium, noted that the lead-uranium ratio was greater in older rocks and, acting on a suggestion by Ernest Rutherford, was the first to measure the age of rocks by the decay of uranium to lead, in 1907. He got results of ages of 400 to 2200\u00a0million years, the first successful use of radioactive decay by Pb/U chemical dating. More recently, older mineral deposits have been dated to about 4.4\u00a0billion years old, close to the best estimate of the age of earth. His work with the uranium decay series led to the discovery of the parent of radium, a new element that he named ionium. Once the existence of isotopes was established, ionium was shown to in fact be thorium-230. Although Boltwood did not get his element on the periodic table, he later got a mineral namesake: Boltwoodite is named after him. In his later days, Boltwood suffered from depression and committed suicide on August 15, 1927."

After relocating from England in the 17th century, the Boltwood family was active in the Amherst community for generations. Lucius was the son of a farmer who worked his way through Williams College to become a lawyer. He was a founder of Amherst College and ran for Governor of Massachusetts as an early member of the Liberty Party in 1841. Thomas Kast Boltwood, son of Lucius, was a lawyer who died in 1872 when his son Bertram was 2 years old. Bertram Boltwood was emotionally close with his mother, Margaret Mathilda, and he grew up in her hometown of Castleton, NY. She prepared him to attend Yale, his father's alma mater, by placing him in private school at a young age, followed by the Albany Academy. Boltwood\u2019s childhood reveals influences and inclinations that foreshadow the scientist he became as an adult. As a boy, he was interested in mechanical gadgets and enjoyed hobbies such as fishing, photography, and minerals. The latter was likely the influence of his uncle, Charles Upham Shepard, who was a mineralogist and a chemist. His personality was reportedly light-hearted, and he was known to play practical jokes in his youth. He was often reminded of a familial tie to Ralph Waldo Emerson through his paternal great grandmother\u2019s sister (Emerson\u2019s mother Ruth Haskins), and it was expected that Boltwood would study and succeed in line with the family legacy."

Afterwards, he returned to Yale and earned a PhD in 1897 and became an instructor in the Sheffield Scientific School there from 1896-1900. His teaching and research work at Yale focused on physical chemistry, despite it being a relatively new field. Lacking resources in English for teaching the subject, he translated two books from German, Alexander Classen, \"Quantitative Analysis by Electrolysis,\" and the other by Charles Van Deventer, \"Physical Chemistry for Beginners.\" He was particularly handy in the lab, often improving upon methods and devices. For example, he developed a low melting point wax that found use in labs across the country and was called, \u201cBoltwax\u201d. From 1900-1906, he had a private lab in New Haven, Connecticut.  He worked as a consulting chemist, analyzing ore samples for miners. This experience brought him into contact with the rare earth metals he had studied as well as uranium and thorium, elements that would become the crux of his greatest scientific contributions."

He developed a friendship with Ernest Rutherford, whose highly influential thinking played a role in much of Boltwood's work. They communicated primarily through overseas correspondence, with the exception of a short period from 1909-1910 when Rutherford invited Boltwood to join him at University of Manchester in England. Their letters from 1904-1912 were published in 1969 in the book Rutherford and Boltwood: Letters on Radioactivity, which reveals an ongoing conversation as the two scientists work to unravel details of radioactivity and the uranium decay series."

The discovery stemmed from his investigations of the uranium decay series and conversations with Rutherford. In 1904, Rutherford gave lectures around the topic of radioactivity as a tool for geologic dating, and presented calculations based on the presence of helium as a product. He dated a sample of fergusonite at 40 million years, with the caveat that helium could escape and would therefore only provide a minimum age. The following year, Boltwood made the assertion that lead was the final decay product in the disintegration of uranium, and that Pb:U ratios increase in older geological samples. In 1907, he published results of analyzing ten mineral samples from different world locations, including a thorianite that measured 2.2 billion years old. This value was ten times greater than any previous estimated age of the Earth, and geologists did not immediately accept the validity of radioactivity as a dating method. Boltwood published a single paper on radiometric dating, instead focusing the majority of his research on the uranium decay series."

At this time, Boltwood showed that old geological samples contain a constant ratio of radium and uranium, and he set out to prove the two are connected. To do so, he attempted to determine radium's parent element by \"growing\" it from uranium's known product, \"uranium X\". His attempts were unsuccessful, and he suspected a long half life would make it impossible to \"grow\" radium in a measurable amount. In 1907, he discovered a new element with a half life of almost 100,000 years before it decays to radium, and he named it \"ionium\" after the ionizing action of its alpha particles. Boltwood was able to prove that ionium disintegrates to radium, and the full connection to uranium was shown in work by Frederick Soddy in 1919. Once the existence of isotopes was established in 1914, Stefanie Horovitz and Otto H\u00f6nigschmid demonstrated that ionium was actually thorium-230, the second known case of an isotope, rather than its own distinct element. However, the work of these two scientists in Vienna, as they precisely measured the atomic weight of lead from radioactive sources, also served to reinforce Boltwood's assertion that lead is the final product in the uranium decay series."

Darwinism really is a matter of life and death.\" In an article published by Books and Culture: A Christian Review, he wrote \"we need to counter our hedonistic, materialistic, and self-centered culture with true Christian compassion, self sacrifice, and self denial.\" Weikart is also a supporter of intelligent design. Weikart is the author of four books, the first being The Myth of Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Is His Theology Evangelical? about the relationship of the theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer (a founding member of the Confessing Church, who was hanged for his involvement in a plot to kill Adolf Hitler) to Evangelicalism. Weikart's second book is  Socialist Darwinism: Evolution in German Socialist Thought from Marx to Bernstein, which contains work from his dissertation. The book argues that Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, August Bebel, Karl Kautsky and Eduard Bernstein \"biologized\" social theory for a \"scientifically grounded socialist theory.\" Historian Daniel Gasman reviewed the book saying it should be read with \"caution,\" and \"Weikart's book inaugurates research into an important area of intellectual history, but the theoretical framework offered does not keep pace with the demanding complexity of the subject.\" His third book, From Darwin to Hitler, has been widely criticized by the academic community and promoted by creationists. His fourth is a sequel, Hitler's Ethic, arguing that Adolf Hitler's \"ideology revolved around evolutionary ethics -- the idea that whatever promoted evolutionary progress is good and whatever hinders it is bad.\" According to Weikart, \"This evolutionary ethic shaped nearly every major feature of Nazi policy: eugenics (measures to improve human heredity, including compulsory sterilization), euthanasia, racism, population expansion, offensive warfare and racial extermination.\" Thomas Pegelow Kaplan, a historian at Davidson College, reviewed the book for Central European History noting Weikart \"pushes his interpretations too far\"  because Weikart \"does not sufficiently integrate the complex motivational factors\" behind ideology, with Kaplan concluding Hitler's Ethic \"offers little in terms of a new, fully convincing understanding of the Nazi dictator's thought.\" Gerwin Strobl, a historian at University of Cardiff, reviewed Hitler's Ethic in European History Quarterly, writing the introduction \"reads like a mixture of a television voiceover and the worst kind of undergraduate essay\" and described the book has two notable weaknesses: \"how \u2018Hitler\u2019s ethics\u2019 were disseminated within the party\" and its \"emphasis on intellectual developments inside Germany,\" which ignores \"that Hitler had set out to copy what he regarded as the Anglo-American example.\" Eric Kurlander, in German Studies Review, wrote: \"Though energetically drawn, this new iteration of the \"intentionalist\" argument invites skepticism in some respects, especially in its attempt to explain World War II and the Holocaust.\" Additionally, Larry Arnhart, a professor of Political Science at Northern Illinois University wrote, \"As Weikart indicates, Hitler was a crude genetic determinist who believed that not only physical traits but even morality and culture were inherited genetically along racial lines, so that moral and cultural evolution depended on genetic evolution. But Weikart doesn't indicate to his readers that Darwin denied this.\" Weikart has responded to this review. In 2016, Weikart published two books with Regnery Publishing, a conservative publishing house: The Death of Humanity: and the Case for Life (which was also translated in Dutch in 2019) and Hitler's Religion: The Twisted Beliefs that Drove the Third Reich. Weikart's The Death of Humanity: and the Case for Life \"charts how influential atheist thinkers have approached ethical questions\" with \"many brief summaries of the thought processes of influential authors, scientists, philosophers, and lawyers who have rejected Judeo-Christian ethics\". In Hitler's Religion, \"Weikart offers no new scholarship: his strength is in his ability to organize existing, mostly primary-source, documentation into a readable and convincing whole\" to show  that Hitler was a pantheist."

        "content": "Johann Wilhelm Baier (11 November 1647 \u2013 19 October 1695) was a German theologian in the Lutheran scholastic tradition. He was born at Nuremberg, and died at Weimar. He studied philology, especially Oriental, and philosophy at Altdorf from 1664 to 1669, in which year he went to Jena and became a disciple of the celebrated Johannes Mus\u00e4us, the representative of the middle party in the Syncretistic Controversy, whose daughter he married in 1674. Taking his doctor\u2019s degree the same year, in 1675 he became professor of church history at the university, and lectured with great success on several different branches of theology. In 1682 he was chosen to represent the Protestant side in the negotiations with the papal legate Nicolas Steno, bishop of Titiopolis, for reunion of the Churches. He was three times rector at Jena before he was called by the elector Frederick III, in 1694, as professor and provisional rector to the new university of Halle. Here his devotion to strict orthodoxy brought him into conflict with some of his colleagues, and the pietistic movement also gave him trouble, so that after a year he was glad to accept the combined positions of chief court preacher,  superintendent, and pastor at Weimar \u2014 which, however, he held only a few months until his death. He left a name in the history of theology, especially by his dogmatic compendium, which still preserves the early Protestant traditions among High Lutherans, especially in America. The Jena theologians, and Johannes Musaeus in particular, had been asked by Ernest the Pious to draw up such a work, to take the place of the antiquated Hutter, and Mus\u00e6us urged his son-in-law to do it. The first edition appeared in 1686, the second, enlarged, in 1691, and it has been frequently reprinted since. It was commended for general use as a textbook by its method, its conciseness, and its absence of mere polemics. It was obviously, however, intended by its author as a vindication of the Jena theology, which had been sharply attacked from Wittenberg, and lay under some suspicion of syncretism. Its dependence upon Mus\u00e6us is really the distinguishing feature of the book, which is largely a compilation from him. Baier\u2019s other works include polemical writings against Erbermann, a convert to Roman Catholicism and a Jesuit, and against the Quakers; and three other compendiums, published after his death (1698), one of exegetical, and one of moral theology, as well as one of the history of dogma. His read significance lies in the fact that he handed on and popularized the theology of Mus\u00e6us; and his work was continued by Buddeus, whom he left at Halle as professor of moral philosophy."

        "content": "Barton was born on 17 January 1911 in Ireland. After graduating from Trinity College, Cambridge University, Barton joined Jardines in 1933 as a tea taster and climbing the ranks to become Tai-pan in 1953 at just 42 years old. Barton was assigned to several key areas throughout Asia spending most of his time in Shanghai before returning to Hong Kong in 1949 when the group's assets fell under the new Communist regime. Barton served with the Irish Guards and fought in the Second World War. He retired from the military in 1944 as a Lt. Colonel and returned to work for Jardine Matheson after the war. A persistent and flamboyant character, he was appointed Taipan of Jardines, replacing Sir John Keswick. During his tenure, he oversaw the incredible growth of the company in Hong Kong and throughout Asia after the devastating war years and continued trade with China. He also served as a director of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation from 1955 to 1959, Vice Chairman from 1960 to 1961. It's also interesting to note that he also served as the Chairman of the bank from 1962 to 1963, holding the chairmanship title of both the bank and Jardines. As taipan of Jardines, he oversaw the opening of the company headquarters in 1956 along Connaught Road, a 16-story building which was already replaced in 1972. He is best remembered for the historic and landmark event of leading Jardines to its initial public offering. Initially distributing the shares at $2.78, within a week it shot up to $5.22, having been oversubscribed 56 times. During his tenure, Jardines owned much of the richest land in Hong Kong, controlled two of the island's three profitable English newspapers, and has substantial interests in banking, shipping, insurance, utilities, streetcars and airlines and being agent for 77 major companies, trading products ranging from machine tools to fine Scotch throughout Asia. He sat in Hong Kong's governing bodies and the boards of its richest banks. He presided over a time when Jardine Matheson was at the peak of its economic and political power over Hong Kong. He founded the Penta Hotel Chain, supported by five airlines: Swiss Air, Alitalia, Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa Airlines. Eventually, Air France and Alitalia backed out of the deal. The Hotel chain was also supported by UBS, Swiss Bank, Deutsch Bank and a British investment Bank. The Pental Hotel chain still exists but mainly in Germany. In a Time article in 1961, he was described as \"Tall (6 ft. 3 in.), suave and social, Cambridge-educated Hugh Barton joined Jardines in 1933 as a tea taster, scrupulously lives up to the company's cherished traditions, including the raising of ponies that race under the Jardines' silks.\" After retiring in 1963, he became an influential diplomat in Europe, representing Hong Kong businesses' interests there. In 1965, he became a director of S.G. Warburg. He was invested as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1966. In describing Jardines, a commentator stated, \"Jardines always was, and still is, a Scottish house that kept the Sabbath and everything else it could lay hands on.\" He died in April 1989 at the age of 78."

        "content": "Heinrich Rubens (30 March 1865, Wiesbaden, Nassau, Germany \u2013 17 July 1922, Berlin, Germany) was a German physicist. He is known for his measurements of the energy of black-body radiation which led Max Planck to the discovery of his radiation law. This was the genesis of quantum theory. After having attended realgymnasium  W\u00f6hlerschule in Frankfurt am Main, he started in 1884 to study electrical engineering at the technical universities in Darmstadt and Berlin. The following year he switched to physics at the University of Berlin which was more to his liking. After just one semester there he transferred to Strasbourg. There he benefited much from the lectures by August Kundt who in 1888 took over the vacant position of Hermann Helmholtz at the University of Berlin. Rubens followed after and got his doctors degree there the same year. In the period 1890\u20131896 he was employed as an assistant at the physics institute and made his habilitation in 1892. He was then a privatdozent and was allowed to teach. Already then he was praised for his experimental investigations of infrared radiation. Rubens got a permanent position in 1896 as docent at the Technical University of Berlin in Berlin-Charlottenburg. He could continue his experimental research at the nearby Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt. It was there he in 1900 did his important measurements of black-body radiation which made him world-famous. He was promoted to professor the same year. After Paul Drude retired in 1906 from his professorship at the University in Berlin, the position was given to Rubens. He was at the same time appointed director of the physics institute. In this way he could influence and lead a large group of colleagues and students. The year after he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences and became in 1908 a corresponding member G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He participated at the two first Solvay conferences after having received the Rumford Medal in 1910  \"on the ground of his researches on radiation, especially of long wave length.\". Heinrich Rubens died in 1922 after a longer illness. At a memorial meeting in the science academy the following year Max Planck said about him: He is buried at the Alter St.-Matth\u00e4us-Kirchhof in Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg with his wife Marie. She took her life in 1941 for fear of being deported and killed by the Nazis. The burial place is near that of Gustav Kirchhoff, who founded spectroscopy and formulated the first laws of black-body radiation."

        "content": "Already as a student was Rubens fascinated by electromagnetic radiation as theoretically described by Maxwell and experimentally demonstrated by Hertz. Through the influence of Kundt he had become interested in understanding the optical properties of different materials. In his doctoral work he showed that reflection of light increases with increasing wavelengths into the infrared region. As a related result he could present an experimental verification of Maxwell's theory for electromagnetic waves in different media. This effort also turned into a demonstration of the validity of these equations for infrared radiation. Rubens succeeded in this for wavelengths up to 10 \u03bcm. Through the improvements of instruments and invention of new techniques he could measure infrared radiation for larger and larger wavelengths. One of his goals was to better understand the reflexion of radiation by metals and crystals. It was known that this became stronger for wavelengths which were absorbed. This lead him to a new, powerful method by selective reflexion from several crystals to isolate a narrow range of infrared wavelengths from a broader spectrum of radiation. Using such Reststrahlen he could in 1898 detect wavelengths of sizes around 60 \u03bcm. Together with Ferdinand Kurlbaum he started the same year to measure the energy content of black-body radiation in the far infrared region using this technique. For a fixed value of the wavelength they found that the energy increased linearly with the temperature. This was in disagreement with the ruling Wien's radiation law, but consistent with an alternative law proposed by Lord Rayleigh. On 7 October 1900 Rubens and his wife were invited to dinner by Max Planck. Rubens told then his host about the new measurements done at a wavelength 51 \u03bcm. After the guests had left Planck managed to derive a new formula for the radiation energy which was consistent with the new results. He wrote it down on a postcard which Rubens received the following day. A few days later Rubens reported back that it seemed to fit all his measurements. On 14 December Planck could present to Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft a derivation of his new radiation law based on the idea of quantization of energy. This was the \"birthday\" of the new quantum physics. In the following years Rubens could improve his measurements of infrared radiation and reached wavelengths of several hundred micrometres. This enabled him also to make more and more accurate tests of Plancks new radiation theory and related studies of matter which soon could be described by quantum mechanics. He was loved by his students and colleagues for his care and accuracy in all experimental work. In this connection he constructed in 1905 a Rubens' tube to illustrate standing sound waves using a flammable gas in a tube. This was probably inspired by his teacher Kundt's tube where fine sand or powder was used for the same purpose."

He has written several Christian books and is a regular speaker at Word Alive and other conferences. As an 18-year-old Sach was an atheist and viewed Christians as \"naive, superstitious and ignorant\". Whilst reading Natural Sciences as an undergraduate at St Johns College, University of Cambridge, Sach was contacted by the Christian Union who challenged him to think about whether or not the resurrection of Jesus Christ was a historical fact or not. He eventually concluded that it was, and became a Christian. After his degree, Sach worked as an apprentice for a year at the church of St Andrew the Great, Cambridge. Sach then did a doctorate in neuroscience at the University of York. He published three scientific papers on auditory spatial attention. He then worked for St Helen's Bishopsgate in London for three years. Whilst there he studied part-time at the Cornhill Training Course. From there went to Oak Hill Theological College (with a six-month exchange to Moore Theological College, Sydney) to train for ordination in the Church of England. He then worked as a curate at St Helens for several years, leading the 6pm and then the 10:30am congregations. Sach is currently a minister at Grace Church Greenwich and a tutor on the Cornhill Training Course. Sach has co-authored a number of books on biblical exegesis in the \"Dig Deeper\" series. He authored a booklet titled \"Has Science Disproved God?\"  published by UCCF, which aimed to \"explain why I think it is reasonable to believe in God in the face of science\"."

Oram, the son of the blacksmith who made the beautiful railings around Chichester cathedral, was educated at Brighton, Hove and Sussex Grammar School  and the London School of Economics. He became a teacher. In the Second World War he was initially recognised as a conscientious objector, but voluntarily renounced his exemption to join the army. He served in the Royal Artillery and landed in Normandy three days after D-Day, continuing on the campaign into Germany. After the war he briefly returned to teaching before moving in 1946 to work for the Co-operative Party as Research Officer. He advocated consumer welfare and democratising industrial relations, writing a series of publications including The People's Industry. Oram attempted to win the parliamentary seats of Lewes, in 1945, where he was supported by the charismatic Harold Laski (who had greatly influenced him at LSE) and by his future wife Joan, and of Billericay, in 1950, where he lost despite winning 19,437 votes. He served as Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament for East Ham South from 1955 to February 1974. His maiden speech concentrated on the successes of the cooperative movement. In January 1958 he introduced a private members bill to reform and speed up parliamentary procedures. He was Parliamentary Secretary for Overseas Development 1964 to 1969 under Barbara Castle, Anthony Greenwood, Arthur Bottomley and his Parliamentary neighbour in East Ham, Reg Prentice; and a Government Whip 1976 to 1978 in the House of Lords. He accompanied the Prime Minister (Harold Wilson) on trips to Africa, including unsuccessful negotiations with Ian Smith after Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965. He took a particular interest in promoting education in Africa, leading the UK Delegation to UNESCO and increasing resources for teacher training. Oram was a European enthusiast and opponent of nuclear weapons. In October 1971 he was the only Labour and Co-operative MP to support the Conservative Government's motion to negotiate membership of the European Community.  He became co-ordinator of the development programmes of the Co-operative Alliance in 1971 and held this office until 1973. He was a member of the Commonwealth Development Corporation in the years 1975 and 1976, and was made Chairman of the Co-operative Development Agency from 1978 to 1981.  He was the Opposition Spokesman in the House of Lords on Overseas Development 1983\u201387. On 22 January 1976 he was created a life peer taking the title Baron Oram, of Brighton in the County of East Sussex. He chaired the Boards of the Brighton Co-operative Society and of the League of Sussex Downsmen. He was a patron of Humanists UK until his death in 1999."

He played in the 1984 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Chatham. Wiseman owns the only retired number of the former Chatham MicMacs (now named Jr. Maroons) of the former Western Ontario Hockey League. His number 9 was retired after he left Chatham to play for the University of Michigan Wolverines. Approximately 3,600 spectators were in attendance to see Wiseman break Ed Olczyk's single season point record. Wiseman amassed 147 points in just 40 games in 1989\u201390. During his career at University of Michigan, he was named Freshman of the Year in 1991, had Frozen Four appearances in 1992 and 1993 and the Wolverines were CCHA Tournament Champions in 1994.  He finished his U-M career with 248 points including a school-record 164 assists. He was drafted by the New York Rangers in the 12th round of the 1991 NHL Entry Draft after his freshman season, but remained at U-M to complete his stellar career. Wiseman would next move to play hockey professionally.  He played for the Chicago Wolves (IHL), St. John's Maple Leafs (AHL), Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL), and Houston Aeros (IHL) before retiring due to concussion problems stemming from an injury suffered during the Aeros' 1999\u20132000 playoff season. He helped the Houston Aeros capture the Turner Cup in the 1998\u20131999 season and was named the IHL's Most Valuable Player in 1999 after leading the league in scoring with 109 points. After his playing career, he spent one season as a video coach with the Dallas Stars and another as an assistant coach at Princeton University.  From 2012-2019, Wiseman was an assistant coach for varsity ice hockey at the University of Michigan.  Since 2019, he has been an assistant coach for the Edmonton Oilers.

        "content": "In 2007, Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick submitted a bill that would allow the construction and operation of three resort-style casinos in the state. He argued that these casinos would generate $2 billion for the state economy and add $400 million in annual casino revenue and $200 million in fees per license to the state coffers as well as add $50 million to $80 million in sales, meal, and hotel taxes. He also touted that the casinos would create 30,000 construction jobs and 20,000 permanent jobs. Patrick's proposed that the revenue generated would be spent to beef up local law enforcement, create a state gambling regulatory agency, repair roads and bridges ($200 million), gambling addiction treatment ($50 million) and the remainder would go towards property tax relief. DiMasi strongly opposed the plan, questioning the governor's job and revenue projections, and was opposed to what he referred to as a casino culture, saying: \"Do we want to usher in a casino culture\u2014with rampant bankruptcies, crime and social ills\u2014or do we want to create a better Massachusetts for all sectors of the society?\" On March 20, 2008, the Massachusetts House of Representatives rejected Patrick's casino bill by a vote of 108 to 46. Despite the overwhelming vote, questions were raised by critics of DiMasi as to the tactics he used to win. These included allegations that he promised a subsequent vote on a bill that would allow slot machines at the state's four racetracks and the pre-vote promotions of six lawmakers who had been thought to support the bill, but either abstained or voted against the bill. DiMasi denied that any promise had been made on the race track bill and  denied that the promotions were connected to the casino bill vote."

He was known as a scholar of William Shakespeare and many of his poems were Shakespearean sonnets. He was well-known and respected amongst the Transcendentalists, though he had a mental breakdown early in his career. Born in Salem, Massachusetts to two unwed first cousins, Jones Very became associated with Harvard University, first as an undergraduate, then as a student in the Harvard Divinity School and as a tutor of Greek. He heavily studied epic poetry and was invited to lecture on the topic in his home town, which drew the attention of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Soon after, Very asserted that he was the Second Coming of Christ, which resulted in his dismissal from Harvard and his eventual institutionalization in an insane asylum. When he was released, Emerson helped him issue a collection called Essays and Poems in 1839. Very lived the majority of his life as a recluse from then on, issuing poetry only sparingly. He died in 1880."

        "content": "Very was born on August 28, 1813, in Salem, Massachusetts, and spent much of his childhood at sea. He was the eldest of six children, born out of wedlock to two first cousins; his sister Lydia also became a writer. His mother, Lydia Very, was known for being an aggressive freethinker who made her atheistic beliefs known to all. She believed that marriage was only a moral arrangement and not a legal one. His father, also named Jones Very, was a captain during the War of 1812 and was held in Nova Scotia for a time by the British as a prisoner of war. When the younger Jones Very was ten, his father, by then a shipmaster, took him on a sailing voyage to Russia. A year later, his father had Very serve as a cabin boy on a trip to New Orleans, Louisiana. His father died on the return trip, apparently due to a lung disease he contracted while in Nova Scotia. As a boy, Very was studious, well-behaved, and solitary. By 1827, he left school when his mother told him he must take the place of his father and care for the family. After working at an auction house, Very became a paid assistant to the principal of a private school in Salem as a teenager. The principal, Henry Kemble Oliver, exposed his young assistant to philosophers and writers, including James Mackintosh, to influence his religious beliefs and counteract his mother's atheism. He composed a poem for the dedication of a new Unitarian church in Salem: \"O God; On this, our temple, rest thy smile, Till bent with days its tower shall nod\"."

        "content": "Very enrolled at Harvard College in 1834. During his college years, he was shy, studious, and ambitious of literary fame. He had become interested in the works of Lord Byron, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller. His first few poems were published in his hometown newspaper, the Salem Observer, while he completed his studies. He graduated from Harvard in 1836, ranked number two in his class. He was chosen to speak at his commencement; his address was titled \"Individuality\". After graduating, Very served as a tutor in Greek before entering Harvard Divinity School, thanks to the financial assistance of an uncle. Though Very never completed his divinity degree, he held temporary pastorates in Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Very became known for his ability to draw people into literature, and was asked to speak at a lyceum in his hometown of Salem in 1837. There he was befriended by Elizabeth Peabody, who wrote to Ralph Waldo Emerson suggesting Very lecture in Concord. In 1838, Emerson arranged a talk by Very at the Concord Lyceum. Very lectured on epic poetry on April 4 of that year, after he had walked twenty miles from Salem to Concord to deliver it.  Emerson made up for the meager $10 payment by inviting Very to his home for dinner. Emerson signed Very's personal copy of Nature with the words: \"Har[mony] of Man with Nature Must Be Reconciled With God\". For a time, Very tried to recruit Nathaniel Hawthorne as a brother figure in his life. Though Hawthorne treated him kindly, he was not impressed by Very. Unlike Hawthorne, Emerson found him \"remarkable\" and, when Very showed up at his home unannounced along with Cornelius Conway Felton in 1838, Emerson invited several other friends, including Henry David Thoreau, to meet him. Emerson, however, was surprised at Very's behavior in larger groups. \"When he is in the room with other persons, speech stops, as if there were a corpse in the apartment\", he wrote. Even so, in May 1838, the same month Very published his \"Epic Poetry\" lecture in the Christian Examiner, Emerson brought Very to a meeting of the Transcendental Club, where the topic of discussion was \"the question of mysticism\". At the meeting, held at the home of Caleb Stetson in Medford, Massachusetts, Very was actively engaged in the discussion, building his reputation as a mystic within that circle."

        "content": "Very was known as an eccentric, prone to odd behavior and may have suffered from bipolar disorder. The first signs of a breakdown came shortly after meeting Emerson, as Very was completing an essay on William Shakespeare. As Very later explained, \"I felt within me a new will ... it was not a feeling of my own but a sensible will that was not my own... These two consciousnesses, as I may call them, continued with me\". In August 1837, while traveling by train, he was suddenly overcome with terror at its speed until he realized he was being \"borne along by a divine engine and undertaking his life-journey\". As he told Henry Ware Jr., professor of pulpit eloquence and pastoral care at Harvard Divinity School, divine inspiration helped him suddenly understand the twenty-fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew and that Christ was having his Second Coming within him. When Ware did not believe him, Very said, \"I had thought you did the will of the Father, and that I should receive some sympathy from you\u2014But I now find that you are doing your own will, and not the will of your father\". Very also said he was under the influence of the Holy Spirit and composed verse while in this state. Emerson did not believe Very's claim and, noting the poor writing, he asked, \"cannot the spirit parse & spell?\" Very said he was also tormented by strong sexual desires which he believed were held in check only by the will of God. To help control himself, he avoided speaking with or even looking at women\u2014he called it his \"sacrifice of Beauty\". One of Very's students, a fellow native of Salem named Samuel Johnson Jr., said that people ridiculed Very behind his back since he had \"gained the fame of being cracked (or crazy, if you are not acquainted with Harvard technicalities)\". During one of his tutoring sessions, Very declared that he was \"infallible: that he was a man of heaven, and superior to all the world around him\". He then cried out to his students, \"Flee to the mountains, for the end of all things is at hand\". Harvard president Josiah Quincy III relieved Very of his duties, referring to a \"nervous collapse\" that required him to be left in the care of his younger brother Washington Very, himself a freshman at Harvard. After returning to Salem, he visited Elizabeth Peabody on September 16, 1838, apparently having given up his rule \"not to speak or look at women\". As she recalled, After this, Very told her she would soon feel different, explaining, \"I am the Second Coming\". He performed similar \"baptisms\" to other people throughout Salem, including ministers. It was Reverend Charles Wentworth Upham who finally had him committed. Very was institutionalized for a month at a hospital near Boston, the McLean Asylum, as he wrote, \"contrary to my will\". While there, he finished an essay on Hamlet, arguing that the play is about \"the great reality of a soul unsatisfied in its longings after immortality\" and that \"Hamlet has been called mad, but as we think, Shakespeare thought more of his madness than he did of the wisdom of the rest of the play\". During his stay at the hospital, Very lectured his fellow patients on Shakespeare and on poetry in general. He was released on October 17, 1838, though he refused to renounce his beliefs. His fellow patients reportedly thanked him as he left. McLean's superintendent Luther Bell took credit for saving him \"from the delusion of being a prophet extraordinaire\", which Luther thought was caused by Very's digestive system being \"entirely out of order\". The same month he was released, Very stayed with Emerson at his home in Concord for a week. While he was visiting, Emerson wrote in his journal on October 29, \"J. Very charmed us all by telling us he hated us all.\""

        "content": "Emerson saw a kindred spirit in Very and defended his sanity. As he wrote to Margaret Fuller, \"Such a mind cannot be lost\". Emerson was sympathetic with Very's plight because he himself had recently been ostracized after his controversial lecture the \"Divinity School Address\". He helped Very publish a small volume, Essays and Poems in 1839. The poems collected in this volume were chiefly Shakespearean sonnets. Very also published several poems in the Western Messenger between 1838 and 1840 as well as in The Dial, the journal of the Transcendentalists. He was disappointed, however, that Emerson, serving as editor of the journal, altered his poems. Very wrote to Emerson in July 1842, \"Perhaps they were all improvements but I preferred my own lines. I do not know but I ought to submit to such changes as done by the rightful authority of an Editor but I felt a little sad at the aspect of the piece.\" He was never widely read, and was largely forgotten by the end of the nineteenth century, but in the 1830s and 1840s the Transcendentalists, including Emerson, as well as William Cullen Bryant, praised his work. Very continued writing throughout his life, though sparingly. Many of his later poems were never collected but only distributed in manuscript form among the Transcendentalists. In January 1843, his work was included in the first issue of The Pioneer, a journal edited by James Russell Lowell which also included the first publication of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart\"."

        "content": "Jones Very believed his role as a prophet would last only twelve months. By September 1839, his role was complete. Emerson suggested that Very's temporary mental instability was worth the message he had delivered. In his essay \"Friendship\", Emerson referred to Very: The last decades of Very's life were spent in Salem as a recluse under the care of his sister. It was during these years that he held roles as a visiting minister in Eastport, Maine and North Beverly, Massachusetts, though these roles were temporary because he had become too shy. By age 45, he had retired. In his last forty years, Very did very little. As biographer Edwin Gittleman wrote, \"Although he lived until 1880, Very's effective life was over by the end of 1840.\" He died on May 8, 1880, and, upon hearing of Very's death, Alcott wrote a brief remembrance on May 16, 1880:"

        "content": "The first critical review of Very's book was written by Margaret Fuller and published in Orestes Brownson's Boston Quarterly Review; it said Very's poems had \"an elasticity of spirit, a genuine flow of thought, and unsought nobleness and purity\", though she admitted she preferred the prose in the collection over the poetry. She mocked the \"sing song\" style of the poems and questioned his religious mission. She concluded: \"I am... greatly interested in Mr Very. He seems worthy to be well known.\" James Freeman Clarke admired Very's poetry enough to have several published in his journal, the Western Messenger, between 1838 and 1840. William Ellery Channing admired Very's poetry as well, writing that his insanity \"is only superficial\". Richard Henry Dana Sr. also commented positively on Very's poetry: \"The thought is deeply spiritual; and while there is a certain character of peculiarity which we so often find in like things from our old writers, there is a freedom from quaintness... Indeed, I know not where you would... find any thing in this country to compare with these Sonnets.\" Editor and critic Rufus Wilmot Griswold was impressed enough by Very's poetry to include him in the first edition of his anthology The Poets and Poetry of America in 1842. He wrote to Emerson asking for more information about him and expressing his opinion of his poetry: \"Though comparatively unknown, he seems to be a true poet.\" The modern reassessment of Jones Very as an author of literary importance can be dated to a 1936 essay by Yvor Winters who wrote of the poet, \u201cIn the past two decades two major American writers have been rediscovered and established securely in their rightful places in literary history. I refer to Emily Dickinson and Herman Melville. I am proposing the establishment of a third.\u201d Winters, in speaking of Very's relations with Emerson and his circle, concluded, \u201cThe attitude of the Transcendentalists toward Very is instructive and amusing, and it proves beyond cavil how remote he was from them. In respect to the doctrine of the submission of the will, he agreed with them in principle; but whereas they recommended the surrender, he practised it, and they regarded him with amazement.\u201d Subsequently, William Irving Bartlett, in 1942, outlined the basic biographical facts of Very's life in Jones Very, Emerson\u2019s \u201cBrave Saint.\u201d  A complete scholarly edition of Very's poetic works belatedly appeared, over a century after the poet's death, in 1993."

        "content": "She has published a collection of essays titled 'Sensible Sensuality (2010), where redefining femininity with Eastern perspective, the book explores why sexuality plays a major role in our understanding of Eastern feminism. The author thinks feminism should not act in opposition to men as individuals. To her, feminism is against oppressive and outdated social structures which forces both men and women into positions which are false and antagonistic. Thus, everyone has an important role to play in the feminist movement. It seems ironic that feminism has been characterized as anti-male, when in fact, it seeks to liberate men from the macho stereotypic roles men often have to endure such as the need to suppress feelings, act aggressively, and be deprived of contact with children. Sahoo thinks people should emphasize their femininity rather to impose the so-called stereotyped feministic attitude of the second wave. As an Indian feminist, many of Sarojini Sahoo's writings deal candidly with female sexuality, the emotional lives of women, and the intricate fabric of human relationships, depicting extensively about the interior experiences of women and how their burgeoning sexuality is seen as a threat to traditional patriarchal societies; this book is rare of its kind and has covered the topics that never be discussed so far in any Indian discourse. Her debatable concept on feminism, her denial of Simone De Beauvoir's 'the other theory', make her a prominent feminist personality of South Asia and for which KINDLE Magazine of India has placed her among 25 exceptional mindset women of India."

        "content": "Sarojini Sahoo is a key figure and trendsetter of feminism in contemporary Indian literature. For her, feminism is not a \"gender problem\" or confrontational attack on male hegemony and, as such, differs from the feminist views of Virginia Woolf or Judith Butler. Sahoo accepts feminism as an integral part of femaleness separate from the masculine world. Writing with a heightened awareness of women's bodies, she has developed an appropriate style that exploits openness, fragmentation, and nonlinearity. Sahoo, however contends that whilst the woman identity is certainly constitutionally different from that of man, men and women still share a basic human equality. Thus the harmful asymmetric sex /gender \"Othering\" arises accidentally and 'passively'from natural, unavoidable intersubjectivity. Treating female sexuality from puberty to menopause, her fiction always projects a feminine sensibility. Feminine feelings such as restrictions during adolescence or pregnancy, fear factors such as rape or being condemned by society, the concept of the \"bad girl,\" and so on, are treated thematically and in-depth throughout her novels and short stories. Her feminism is constantly linked to the sexual politics of a woman. She denies patriarchal limits of sexual expression for a woman and she identifies women's sexual liberation as the real motive behind the women's movement. In South Asian Outlook, an e-magazine published from Canada, Menka Walia writes: \"Sahoo typically evolves her stories around Indian women and sexuality, which is something not commonly written about, but is rather discouraged in a traditionalist society. As a feminist, she advocates women's rights and usually gives light to the injustices Eastern women face. In her interviews, she usually talks about the fact that women are second-class citizens in India, backing up these facts with examples of how love marriages are forbidden, the rejection of divorces, the unfairness of dowries, and the rejection of female politicians.\" For her, orgasm is the body's natural call to feminist politics: if being a woman is this good, women must be worth something. Her novels like Upanibesh, Pratibandi and Gambhiri Ghara  cover a myriad of areas from sexuality to philosophy; from the politics of the home to politics of the world. According to American journalist Linda Lowen, Sarojini Sahoo has written extensively as an Indian feminist about the interior lives of women and how their burgeoning sexuality is seen as a threat to traditional patriarchal societies. Sarojini's novels and short stories treat women as sexual beings and probe culturally sensitive topics such as rape, abortion and menopause \u2013 from a female perspective."

        "title": "Sarojini Sahoo_Sexuality",
        "content": "Sexuality is something that can be related to many other aspects of culture, tightly-linked with an individual life, or into the evolution of a culture.  Anyone's class or ethnic or geographic identity could be closely associated to his/her sexuality, or anyone's sense of art or literature.  Sexuality is not just an entity in itself. Still, either in West or in East, there is a reluctant outlook towards sexuality. Society has always tried to hide it from any open forum. But neither society, nor the legislature, or even the judiciary stand by the side of sexuality to support it. In the West, James Joyce's Ulysses or even Radclyffe Hall's Loneliness in the Well or Virginia Woolf's  Orlando are some examples which have to suffer a lot for describing sexuality in literature. Sexuality in literature grew with feminism. Simone De Beauvoir, in her book The Second Sex, first elaborately described the gender role and problem away from biological differences. In Odia literature, Sarojini is considered a key figure to discuss sexuality in her fiction with a sincere effort to express her feminist ideas. Her novel Upanibesh was the first attempt in Odia literature to focus on sexuality as a part of social revolt by any woman. Medha, the protagonist of her novel, was a bohemian .  In her pre-marital stage, she was thinking that it was boring to live with a man lifelong.  Perhaps she wanted a chain free life, where there would be only love, only sex and would not be any monotony.  But she had to marry Bhaskar.  Can Indian society imagine a lady with bohemianism? In her novel Pratibandi, Sarojini has also described the thematic development of sexuality in a woman.  Priyanka, the protagonist of the novel has to encounter the loneliness in the exile of Saragpali, a remote village of India.  This loneliness develops into a sexual urge and soon, Priyanka finds herself sexually attached with a former Member of Parliament.  Though there is an age gap between them, his intelligence impresses her and she discovers a hidden archaeologist in him. In her novel Gambhiri Ghara, she describes an unusual relationship between two people: a Hindu housewife of India and a Muslim artist of Pakistan. It is a net-oriented novel.  A woman meets a very sexually experienced man.  One day he asks if she had any such experience.  The woman, Kuki, scolds him and insults him by calling him a caterpillar.  She said without love, lust is like hunger of a caterpillar.  Gradually they become involved with love, lust, and spiritually.  That man considers her as his daughter, lover, mother, and above all these, as a Goddess.  They both madly love each other, through the internet and on the phone.  They use obscene language and they kiss each other online.  Kuki does not lead a happy conjugal life though she has a love marriage with Aniket.  But the novel is not limited to only a love story. It has a greater aspect. It deals with the relationship between State and individual. Safique is not a Muslim by temperament, but as a historian, thinks the Pakistan of today has separated itself from its roots and looks towards Arabian legends for his history.  He protests that the syllabus of history for the school would start from seventh century A.D., not from the Mahenjodaro and Harappa.  Safique was once arrested after the bomb blast of London for allegation of being associated with the terrorist, but is it a fact?  Later Kuki came to know that Safiques is trapped by a military junta.  The ex-lover of Safique's wife had revenged on Safique by arresting him with an allegation of terrorism. Here, the author deals with the question of terrorism. There is often discussion about terrorism caused by an individual or by a group.  Society rarely discusses terrorism caused by a state. What is a state?  Is it a group of people that resides within political and geographical boundaries?  Are a state's identity, mood and wishes separate from its ruler?  Is the wish of George W. Bush not considered as the wish of America?  Has it reflected the mood and wish of the people of America?  So, every time, the state's arranged anarchism or terrorism is merely a reflection of a terrorism caused by an individual. The great truth lies beneath Safique, as a terrorist, develops from the mind of a military man. The author has successfully painted the difference of sensibility towards sexuality between male and female and has her own credibility for the frankness to deal with sensitive matters, be they matters of politics or matters of sexuality. She has gained a reputation and has her own place in the history of Odia fiction."

        "content": "After graduating from Yale, Crawford enrolled at the University of Michigan School of Law, receiving his law degree in 1893.  As a first-year law student, Crawford was both the unpaid coach and a substitute player for the 1891 Michigan Wolverines football team.  He helped lead the team to a 4\u20135 record.  He has been identified by several sources as the first football coach in University of Michigan history.  Other sources indicate that Crawford and Mike Murphy were the joint head coaches of the 1891 Michigan football team.  Others state that Murphy relinquished the coaching duties to Crawford midway through the season to allow him to focus on his duties as trainer.  The Chicago Daily Tribune reported in November 1891 that the Michigan team was \"coached systematically\" by Murphy, Crawford, Horace Greely Prettyman and James Duffy. While attending Michigan, Crawford also played for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team in 1892 and 1893.  He led the team with a .976 fielding average in 1892.  Crawford appeared in 17 games at catcher and left field for the Wolverines in 1892 and was among the team's leaders in runs (tied for 2nd with 20), stolen bases (tied for 2nd with 13) and putouts (2nd with 115). He was also selected as the captain of the 1893 baseball team. In his history of the University of Michigan, Wilfred Byron Shaw cites Crawford's hiring as a watershed moment in the history of the school's football program: \"A new era in the history of football at Michigan began in 1891, when with a fair schedule and an experienced coach, Frank Crawford (Yale, '91), '93l, the systematic development of a team began ...\"  Although football had been played at Michigan without a coaching staff since 1879, the Associated Press noted at the time of Crawford's death that Crawford \"is credited with introducing football at the University of Michigan in 1891.\""

Crawford reportedly \"brought many innovations,\" including the training table, to Baker's football program.  He led Baker to the Kansas state championship and a 2\u20131 record in \"the triangular league,\" including victories over Washburn (44\u20130) and Kansas (18\u20130).  In December 1892, the Leavenworth Times reported that Crawford had \"succeeded in instilling sufficient foot ball lore into the western farmers to accomplish the defeat of the University of Kansas team by the Baker eleven last week.\"  In May 1893, The Baker Beacon reported: \"The Baker team was ably coached and captained by Frank Crawford who had learned the game at Yale and by the close of the season the team ... was in excellent condition.\""

He was Nebraska's head football coach during the 1893 and 1894 seasons and compiled a 9\u20134\u20131 record.  After starting the 1893 season with a 2\u20132\u20131 record, Crawford's team defeated Iowa, 20\u201318, in a match played in near-blizzard conditions and considered the \"first major victory\" in Nebraska history.  Crawford reportedly also played right halfback and kicked the field goals for Nebraska during the 1893 Iowa game; he was identified in the record book as \"Frank.\"  In 1894, Crawford's team defeated Iowa, 36\u20130. The 1895 team finished the season with five consecutive victories for a 7\u20132 record and the school's first ever conference championship.  During Crawford's tenure at Nebraska, George Flippin played for Crawford and became the first African-American athlete in Nebraska history. However, in 1893, Flippin was voted team captain by the team, but this decision was vetoed by Crawford, stating: \"It takes a man with brains to be a captain; all there is to Flippin is brute force.\" Flippin went on to be a well-respected physician in Polk County, Nebraska and the first African-American inducted into the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame."

        "content": "Cox entered politics soon after opening his practice, winning his first race for elective office in 1908, for a seat on the Boston Common Council.  The following year he won election to the state legislature, where he served nine annual terms, the last four as Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.  During these years he became politically associated with Calvin Coolidge, who was Senate President and Lieutenant Governor.  Coolidge tapped Cox as his running mate for governor in 1918, and Cox served two one-year terms as lieutenant governor.  Coolidge stepped back to run for Vice President of the United States in 1920. Cox ran for governor in 1920, which was the first two-year term for the office.  His victory over John Jackson Walsh was part of a broad national win for the Republicans, including a sweep of statewide offices in Massachusetts, which was spurred by nativist opposition to Wilson administration policies on immigration.  Cox contributed to the anti-immigrant sentiment in Massachusetts by characterizing discontented immigrants as a \"motley array of questionable groups and influences\".  He won reelection in 1922, in another race against disorganized Democratic opposition.  Although the state was in an economic downturn (an early whisper of the Great Depression), with textile production dropping and wages down, his campaigns emphasized \"economy and sound administration\" in governance, terms which characterized Republican campaigns through the 1920s.  In 1922, Cox defeated former Mayor of Boston John \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald by more than 60,000 votes. As governor, Cox was somewhat more progressive than Coolidge, advancing a variety of modest reforms.  He increased schooling requirements and reduced working hours for children, allowed labor unions to instigate lawsuits against employers, and improved workmen's compensation coverage.  He signed legislation restricting the ability of state banks to engage in speculative investments, and instituted a commission on finance and reform to oversee the state's finances. In the 1922 race, Cox claimed credit for reducing income taxes by $2 million and the state's debt by $12 million.  Substantive reforms were typically buried by the legislature, which studied reform proposals but generally did not act on them.  Cox opted not to run for reelection in 1924, supporting Lieutenant Governor Alvan T. Fuller as his successor."

Kim was a founding member of the Department of Archaeology and Ancient Art History at SNU. In South Korea, the academic juxtaposition of archaeology and ancient art history is partly a reflection of the status of such studies in traditional Korean and Northeast Asian culture. However, the mixing of the two is also a reflection of the combination of education that Kim Won-yong received at Keij\u014d Imperial University and NYU.

Kim Won-yong did research on all aspects and all periods of Korean prehistory and early history, and can be considered as the 'Father of Korean Archaeology'. However, Kim will be remembered for laying the foundation of academic archaeology, symbolized by the publication in 1973 of his seminal work, Hanguk Gogohak Gaeseol [Introduction to Korean Archaeology]. This influential book was reprinted 20 times between 1973 and 1996 and remains a must on the reading list of all students of Korean prehistory and early history. Kim published hundreds of articles and excavation reports over his career in Korean, English, and Japanese. He also trained many generations of the leading archaeologists in Korea. Kim Won-yong realized the importance of Korean ancient and prehistoric cultural heritage, and served as a Senior Committee member of the National Cultural Heritage Committee of Korea from 1958 to 1992. He was a great proponent of academic exchange with western archaeology, and as such did research with archaeologists such as Richard J. Pearson. Kim was also a vocal critic of the New Archaeology (Processualism) from its inception in the early 1960s, publishing several key letters to the editor in American Antiquity that were critical of the 'new' theoretical movement and defended the 'old guard' of functional and cultural historical archaeology."

Based for five decades at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Paulu was the author of five books and dozens of articles on radio and television in Great Britain and on the continent of Europe.  His work introduced American scholars and the interested public to broadcasting systems in Eastern and Western European countries where the role of the government and of advertising contrasted sharply with US practices. He taught and lectured widely in the US and Europe and held three appointments in the journalism department of Moscow State University, the first at a time when academic contacts between the US and the then - Soviet Union were rare and the last, when he was 81 years old, as the Soviet Union was collapsing. Paulu became manager of University of Minnesota radio station KUOM in 1928, in the early years of broadcasting, and participated in the development of public radio and television in the US, presiding as the University of Minnesota expanded its broadcasting activities to include short-lived innovations such as the use of closed circuit television to teach college courses and permanent changes to the American broadcasting landscape such as the introduction of educational television to the general public.  He taught classes on American and international broadcasting until he retired with the title of professor and director of the University's Media Resources Department in 1978. Born in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, and raised in small towns in South Dakota, Paulu developed an early interest in classical music as a result of hearing the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra perform when he was a boy.  His broadcasting career began in 1929, when he was working toward a degree in music at the University of Minnesota and took a part-time job as a student announcer at the university's young radio station WLB (later KUOM).  He earned a BA (1931) and BS (1932) in music along with an MA degree in history from the University of Minnesota.  While stationed in London and Luxembourg with the United States Office of War Information during World War II he developed an interest in European broadcasting, and in 1949 was awarded a PhD in communications from New York University. He was a frequent substitute trombonist for the Minnesota (formerly Minneapolis) Orchestra from the 1940s to the 1960s and contributed significantly to the Orchestra's oral history project through a series of taped interviews with performing artists. Among Paulu's numerous awards were five Fulbright Scholarships, three Ford Foundation grants, and a Sigma Delta Chi Award for journalism research.  He served as president of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters and was a member of US delegations to UNESCO. Paulu was married for 60 years to the former Frances Tuttle Brown and was the father of three;  he died at age  92 of Parkinson's."

He was an outfielder over parts of nine seasons with the New York Giants, Chicago Cubs, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Robertson was born in Portsmouth, Virginia. He attended North Carolina State University after matriculating at Maury High School and Norfolk Academy. In 1916 and 1917, he tied for the National League lead in home runs (with Cy Williams and Gavvy Cravath, respectively) while playing for New York. The short-distanced right field fence at the Polo Grounds was a frequent target of long drives hit by Robertson and his Giants' teammate, Benny Kauff. Their hits to right field became so much of an issue that  National League officials convened  following  the 1916 baseball season. Baseball officials decided to amend Rule #1, which read the shortest distance from a fence or stand on fair territory to the home base should be 235 feet. The amendment to the rule changed the shortest distance from a stand or fence to 270 feet. Robertson played for the Giants in the 1917 World Series against the Chicago White Sox, his 11 hits leading the team in the Series in a losing cause. A member of the Giants during the 1922 season, he did not make an appearance in the 1922 World Series. The champion Giants swept all four games of that Series from their crosstown rival New York Yankees. In a nine-year major-league career, Robertson posted a .287 batting average (812-2830) with 366 runs, 47 home runs and 364 RBI in 804 games played. His on-base percentage was .318 and slugging percentage was .409. He surpassed the .300 batting mark three times. On September 14, 1920, he went 5-5 as a member of the Cubs. On August 19, 1921, he had 8 RBI in a game as a member of the Pirates. Eleven days later, on August 30, he hit for the cycle. Robertson died at the age of 81 in Virginia Beach, Virginia."

That year, The Smithsonian Institution published his catalog Flora of the State of Washington. He also published Flora of Southeast Washington and Adjacent Idaho (1914) and Flora of the Northwest Coast (1915). These works established him as an authority on the plants of the northwestern U.S. In 1903, Piper began a career at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., which lasted until his death there. He worked on the domestication and introduction of grasses. On a trip to Africa, he found Sudan grass and introduced it to North America as a forage plant (vegetable matter eaten by livestock). Piper noted that much less study had been made of forage crops as compared to cotton, cereals, and other crops. He attributed this to the lack of economic incentive in studying forage plants. The soybean was another subject of Piper's studies. In 1923, he wrote, with William J. Morse, The Soybean, a thorough and now classic monograph of the species. The botanist was instrumental in establishing this plant as a successful crop in the U.S. It became a fundamental part of U.S. agriculture. Since the 1970s, it has been the second largest and most valuable crop in the United States after corn - and ahead of wheat. He was a founding member of the American Society of Agronomy in 1907 and served later as its president. Piper's knowledge of grasses led him to become Chairman of the United States Golf Association's Green Section from 1920 until his death. The orchid genus Piperia, containing eight species (e.g., Piperia yadonii), is named after him."

John Veale was educated at Repton and studied modern history at Corpus Christi College, Oxford (his father's old college). Discovering Sibelius and Shostakovich, and receiving encouragement from William Walton, Sir Hugh Allen and Humphrey Searle, he decided to become a composer, taking some lessons from Egon Wellesz. Veale sketched out his first symphony during the war while serving in the Army's Education Corps. After demobilisation he returned to Corpus Christi for more composition lessons with Wellesz and counterpoint and harmony with Thomas Armstrong. While there he began composing incidental music for Oxford University Dramatic Society productions, in which Kenneth Tynan and Lindsay Anderson were involved. Between 1949 and 1951 he won a scholarship to study in California with Roger Sessions and Roy Harris (the latter's only English pupil). He composed Panorama as an orchestral tribute to San Francisco. Veale had married Diana Taylor in August 1944. In September 1951 came the death of their four-year-old daughter Jane. The Elegy for flute, harp and strings was written in her memory, and was adopted and recorded by the Boyd Neel Orchestra the following year, with soloists Richard Adeney and Maria Korchinska."

The Symphony No. 1 was premiered by Sir John Barbirolli at the Cheltenham Music Festival in 1952. The Clarinet Concerto had its premiere at the Royal Festival Hall in 1954, conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent. The Metropolis concert overture was also premiered in 1955 by Sir Charles Groves). From 1954 film scores took up most of his time, The Purple Plain being the first. From that score he derived his choral work Kubla Khan, effectively evoking the atmosphere of the East. Eight film scores followed, ending with Clash by Night in 1963. The following year he composed the Symphony No. 2, his largest purely orchestral work. Unable to support himself and his family through composition work, Veale joined the Oxford Mail as film correspondent and sometimes music critic between 1966 and 1980, and also worked as copy editor at Oxford University Press (1968\u20131987).

After hearing Mass, and praying until terce,...the priest, at the request of St. Francis, took the missal, and having made the sign of the most holy cross, opened it three times in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the first opening, they found that saying which Christ spake in the Gospel to the young man which inquired the way of perfection: 'If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor and follow Me'. At the second opening, they found that saying which Christ spake to the Apostles, when He sent them forth to preach: 'Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor scrip, nor shoes, nor money'; intending thereby to teach them that they ought to set all their hope of living upon God, and to turn all their thoughts to preaching the Holy Gospel. At the third opening of the missal they found that saying which Christ spake: 'If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'. Bernard sold all that he had and went to the Square of St. George, where assisted by Francis, he gave everything to widows, to orphans, to prisoners, to monasteries, to hospitals and to pilgrims. In 1211, Francis tasked Bernard with preaching to the worldly and wealthy residents of Bologna. Upon first entering Bologna, because of his appearance, he was mocked and abused as a thief or deserter; but after showing Francis' Rule to the local magistrate, the people's attitude changed. Bernard subsequently asked Francis to send someone to replace him at Bologna lest he be tempted to pride due to the honor and respect shown to him. Francis then sent Bernard to Lombardy. He was then sent to Florence. After the family of St Clare tried to forcibly remove her from the Benedictine convent of San Paulo near Bastia, Bernard accompanied her the Benedictine nuns of the convent of . In 1213, he accompanied Francis on a missionary journey through Spain, but Francis directed Bernard to remain behind at one point to tend to a poor invalid. When they met again a year later, the sick man had recovered, and Francis and Bernard continued through Aragon and Catalonia, Roussillon to Montpellier, and through Piedmont back to his chapel at Santa Maria dei Angeli in Assisi. He subsequently became Minister Provincial in Spain until 1219, when he was succeeded by John Parenti. Together with Angelo Tancredi, and Leo of Assisi, Bernard remained close to Francis, especially during the last two years of Francis' life. St Francis imparted a special blessing to him, although Thomas of Celano reserves this blessing for Elias. After the death of Francis, Bernard had occasion to take to task the Vicar General Elias for riding in a large horse-drawn coach, which to Bernard was not in accord with the Rule. Bernard died around 1241 and is buried close to the tomb of St Francis in the Basilica of St Francis in Assisi."

They had four daughters and one son \u2013 the latter being the jazz trumpeter and radio presenter Humphrey Lyttelton. Lyttelton retired in 1945, having taught at Eton for his entire career. He taught, among others, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Cyril Connolly, J. B. S. Haldane, and John Bayley. He taught mostly classics in the fifth form, but became known for his optional course of English as \"extra studies\" for senior specialists. The biographer Philip Ziegler said of him: George Lyttelton was one of the  greatest of English schoolmasters. He was wise and tolerant; his massive presence ensured a dignity which his fine sense of the ridiculous alleviated without diminishing; he cared passionately about good writing and communicated that passion to his pupils."

        "content": "From that study we staggered with our arms full of books, Wells and Hemingway, Milton and Dr Johnson, Henry James and George Moore, our minds fired by his enthusiasm and wise advice, our shoulders tingling from the squeeze of his mighty hand as he guided us through the bookshelves. We think of him... majestically immobile as he umpired in the Field, and he was the best of them all in ruling the game and in writing about it afterwards; or... those brilliant expositions of the reading or writing of English where he achieved the perfect artistry of teaching; or at his Old Boy dinners, enveloped in a vast and aging dinner-jacket, delivering with commendable timing a string of improbable stories about his large family or the more obscure annals of Suffolk agricultural life. Lyttelton was a member of the Johnson Club and The Literary Society in London, and of the Marylebone Cricket Club. Between the wars, he contributed The Times'''s reports on the Eton and Harrow matches, usually anonymously, but in 1929 on the occasion of the hundredth match his tour d'horizon of the series appeared under his name. His reports were later described in The Times as the best prose of their time. In 1945 Lyttelton retired from Eton and moved to Grundisburgh, Suffolk, where he died at the age of 79."

This correspondence, published after Lyttelton's death as The Lyttelton/Hart-Davis Letters, was an immediate literary success and eventually ran to six volumes. Reviewers contrasted Hart-Davis's weekly accounts of a busy urban life with Lyttelton's detached, and often humorous, observations from his retirement in Suffolk. The Daily Telegraph'' said of them: \"In a hundred years' time, I suspect, the letters will be read with as much pleasure as they are today.... This is a book one could go on quoting forever.\" In 2002 Lyttelton's commonplace book was edited and published, confirming how broad his literary interests were, ranging from Greek and Latin classics to quirky advertisements and press cuttings \u2013 not all of them fit for publication, as his son Humphrey makes clear in the foreword to the commonplace book."

        "content": "Joseph Dillon Ford (born February 6, 1952 in Americus, Georgia, US, died March 8, 2017) was an American composer and author. He held undergraduate degrees in music and graduate degrees in both musicology and landscape architecture. Although he focused on keyboard performance during his college years, Ford completed his training at Harvard as a Variell Scholar specializing in historical musicology. He studied twentieth-century composers and compositional techniques with Ivan Tcherepnin, the works of Bach and Handel with Christoph Wolff, Dowland and the English lutenists with John Ward, and the music of medieval Aquitaine with David Hughes. His major works include three symphonies, a piano concerto, several harpsichord concertos and sonatas, choral music, and a large quantity of chamber and solo works for the piano and other instruments.  Although most of his oeuvre is tonal\u2014often very traditionally so, he also produced non-tonal work using both acoustic and electronic media, and developed synthetic chromatic dialects amenable to both idioms. Keenly interested in emergent music and telecommunications technologies and the rich potential they offer for international creative collaborations, he also conceived and brought to fruition numerous large-scale projects in which his interdisciplinary artistic background proved to be an especially useful asset.  These include the world's largest sound sculpture, an ongoing Web-based work that commemorates the monumental \"Standing Buddhas of Bamiyan\" demolished by the Taliban in 2001;  the \"Westron Wynde\" Project (begun in 2004), for which composers in the US, Canada, and the UK each contributed music for James J. Pellerite (former principal flutist of the Philadelphia Orchestra); the Delian Suites Nos. 1 through 5 (2005\u201309), each exploring various tonal idioms (No. 4 in cooperation with the Colloque Fou de Basson, Conservatoire Gabriel Faur\u00e9, Angoul\u00eame); Nu Mu [sic!] Unlimited (2006\u201309), the world's first virtual new music festival; and Ye New Music Fayre (2008\u201309), a seminal event featuring new music composed in traditional tonal and modal styles. Ford was the founder of the Delian Society, whose efforts to reinvigorate tonal music attracted many composers and performers on six continents and drew attention to the accomplishments of other outstanding artists. He resided in Gainesville, Florida until his death."

        "content": "Frederick Waldegrave Head MC & Bar (18 April 1874 \u2013 18 December 1941) was Anglican archbishop of Melbourne, Australia. Head was born in Tollington Park, London, the son of the Rev. Canon George Frederick Head and his wife Mary Henrietta, n\u00e9e Bolton. Educated at Alton School, Plymouth, Windlesham House School, near Brighton, Repton School, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, Head graduated B.A. with first class honours in history in 1896, proceeded to M.A. in 1900, and received a B.D. degree in 1929. He was ordained deacon in 1902 and priest in 1903, was dean and tutor of Emmanuel College from 1903 to 1907, then senior tutor and chaplain of the college from 1907 to 1921. In 1915, he was interviewed for a commission as a Temporary Chaplain to the Forces. His lack of parochial experience counted against him, and he was thought to be \u2018slow in movement\u2019. After a second interview in January, 1916, he was appointed and posted to France. He could speak French and had already spent a year there working in a YMCA hut. He was attached to the Guards Division. \u2018Head was accepted from the start (by the Guards) ... Head, however, who might have been expected to be handicapped from the start as a Cambridge don, was an outstanding success. He was as successful with the officers in a lecture on Napoleon as he was with the men singing \u2018Tommy Tickler\u2019s Jar\u2019\u2019. By the time of his demobilisation in 1919, Head was Senior Chaplain to the Guards Division and the holder of a Military Cross and Bar. There is a citation for the Bar, \u2018For most conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during operations lasting for several days, when he was continually in the front line accompanying an attack, and by his splendid example inspired the men on all occasions, whilst his attention to wounded and dying men were performed under continuous and heavy fire of all descriptions. His behaviour was the admiration of the whole division' In October, 1918, the Deputy Chaplain-General described him as \u2018First Rate ... in every way\u2019. His apparent \u2018slowness in movement\u2019 and lack of parochial experience did not, as was feared, handicap his excellent wartime service. He was vicar of Christ Church, East Greenwich from 1922 to 1926, chaplain to King George V from 1922 to 1929, and canon and sub-dean of Liverpool Cathedral from 1926 to 1929. Head was considered for bishoprics in England during the 1920s, particularly Peterborough in 1923, but he had not impressed Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury who wrote to the Prime Minister that Head \u2018was not in what I should regard as the first rank of men of power and leadership' In September 1929 he accepted the archbishopric of Melbourne, was consecrated in Westminster Abbey on 1 November 1929, and enthroned in St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, on 23 December 1929. In Melbourne, Head soon made himself acquainted with the various parishes and clergy. He found a diocese that already had many commitments in connexion with church schools and social work, and the financial depression which began just about the time of his arrival made a strong forward policy inopportune. He interested himself in the question of the re-union of the Christian churches, and in the holding together of his own diocese by preaching peace and goodwill to all, and setting a personal example of plain living and high thinking. At one period he voluntarily gave up a quarter of his stipend, and refused to countenance any expenditure which might lighten his own burden of work. If it was possible to help a parish by attending some function or service he made it his duty to be there, and his relations with his clergy were of the friendliest. From 1933 he was chaplain general to the Commonwealth military forces. Tactful, unassuming, and modest, scholarly and hard-working, much interested in social questions, Head was a steady influence for good in Melbourne. On 7 December 1941 he was driving his car to a confirmation service and ran into a post; he died from his injuries on 18 December 1941. His ashes are interred in St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. He married in 1904 Edith Mary Colman, who survived him with one son. Head was the author of The Fallen Stuarts, published in 1901, and Six Great Anglicans, which appeared in 1929."

Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, the son of John Michael MacWilliam and Doris Louise Coghill, MacWilliam studied at Simon Fraser University. In 1971, he married Arlene Leslie Sundvick. MacWilliam ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in 1983. He was elected to represent Okanagan North in the assembly as a New Democratic Party member in a 1984 by-election held following the death of Donald James Campbell. At the time, MacWilliam's victory was considered a major upset as he was a 35-year old high school teacher facing off against Harold Thorlakson, a popular area rancher representing the governing Social Credit Party in a seat the party had held consistently since 1952. In the lead-up to the 1986 provincial election, MacWilliam became embroiled in an internal party debate over whether to force the resignation of then-leader Bob Skelly, with some in the party concerned about Skelly's popularity compared to that of the new Premier Bill Vander Zalm. MacWilliam spoke candidly about the party's internal discussions to the Canadian Press, commenting \"This is a very sensitive topic and I think I might be overstepping my limits on this.\" MacWilliam was defeated in his bid for reelection in the province's 1986 election. MacWilliam entered federal politics after winning the 1988 federal election at the Okanagan\u2014Shuswap electoral district for the New Democratic Party. During his tenure in parliament, MacWilliam earned a reputation as a rebellious partisan, often breaking with his caucus on votes. Notably, in 1992, MacWilliam was one of five NDP MPs who publicly broke with party leader Audrey McLaughlin over Bill C-81, which updated legislation surrounding referendums. The party's official position was that the bill needed firm spending caps for referendum sides, which MacWilliam disregarded in his vote. By the end of 1992, Vancouver Sun columnist Peter O'Neil gave MacWilliam a grade of \"C-\" on his performance, writing that the MP's \"judgment [was] in question.\" In his 1993 bid for re-election, MacWilliam lost to Darrel Stinson of the Reform Party. In 1997, MacWilliam announced he would be joining the Liberal Party and contest his former seat in the 1997 federal election. In an interview given to the Okanagan Saturday, MacWilliam indicated that he had grown disillusioned with the NDP not long after being elected to parliament, claiming he \"came very close to sitting as an independent.\" This was despite his position as the party's communications critic and decision to run again under the party's banner. MacWilliams also stated the Liberals were courting him during the 1993 election and critiqued the party's ideology and ties to organized labour. In the general election, he was again defeated by Stinson, placing second with only 175 fewer votes than he had received running as a New Democrat in 1993."

He completed  his internship and surgical residency  at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA.   From 1963 -1965 Fischer served as  a Research Associate under Nobel Laureate Julius Axelrod at the National Institutes of Health and in 1968 began working as a Teaching Fellow in Surgery and Fellow of the American Cancer Society at Harvard Medical School. Fischer joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School in 1970.  He served as head of the Surgical Physiological Laboratory and Chief of the Hyperalimentation Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital before assuming the position of Christian R. Holmes Professor and Chairman of the Department of Surgery at University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in 1978.   In addition to his responsibilities as Chairman, Fischer served as a professor of molecular and cellular physiology  and Associate Dean for Community Affairs at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. In 2001 Fischer accepted the position of Chairman of the Department of Surgery and Surgeon-in-Chief at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA and was appointed William V. McDermott Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School.  Fischer recruited 29 surgeons in his first 3 years at Beth Israel Deaconess, which was key in mending the institution\u2019s finances, after a 1996 merger resulted in a loss of more than $280 Million for the  hospital. Fischer's research expertise includes nutritional support, cachexia, sepsis, enterocutaneous fistulas, and surgical education.  In 1999 Fischer was one of 24 surgeons to be recognized by Archives of Surgery for having made \"significant contributions to surgery in the areas of research, clinical care, and surgical education\" in the 20th century. Fischer published over 850 journal articles  and edited 21 books including the standard surgical textbook, Mastery of Surgery. He has served on the editorial board for  13 journals including The American Journal of Surgery, Journal of American College of Surgeons, Archives of Surgery, Journal of Surgical Research,  and Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition. In 2008, Dr. Carol Warfield sued Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Paul Levy, the former CEO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians and Fischer for discrimination and retaliation.  The parties resolved their dispute in February 2013 when Beth Israel Deaconess paid Warfield $7 million, clarified its policies and procedures for employees to report discrimination, agreed to sponsor a lecture series on women\u2019s health and women\u2019s achievement in surgery, and named the hospital\u2019s pain clinic in Warfield\u2019s honor.  In reaching the agreement, the Defendants denied any wrongdoing in the matter and there was no judicial finding of wrongdoing on behalf of Fischer."

        "content": "Claudia Schreiber (born 1958 in Grebenstein, Hesse) is a German journalist and author. After studying journalism, education science and sociology at the University of G\u00f6ttingen and University of Mainz,  1979 \u2013 1985, M.A. degree, she worked as editor, reporter and anchorwoman for S\u00fcdwestfunk (SWF) and Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF), (children's newscast logo!, among others) broadcast networks. After stages in Moscow (1992 \u2013 1996) and Brussels (1996 \u2013 1998), she has been making her home in Cologne and is working as a freelance writer. In her novel Emmas Gl\u00fcck (Emma\u2019s Bliss) of 2003, translated into nine languages, she included motifs from her hometown in northern Hesse. It has been her most successful work so far. With its crisp and witty sentences, its deadpan presentation of the improbable and eccentric and its deep sympathy for its cast of misfits, Schreiber's style in this book somewhat recalls that of Heinrich B\u00f6ll. A film of this book, directed by Sven Taddicken and starring J\u00f6rdis Triebel and J\u00fcrgen Vogel was released in Germany in 2006; its English title is Emma's Bliss. Her children's book Sultan und Kotzbrocken (Sultan and Scumbag), first published in 2004, has so far been translated into four languages. It was produced as a theater play in the \u201cTheater Junge Generation\u201d in Dresden in an adaptation by R\u00fcdiger Pape (director) and J\u00f6rg H\u00fcckler (dramaturgy). The \u201cTheaterkumpanei Ludwigshafen\u201d has produced a bilingual version of the play in an adaptation by B\u00e4rbel Maier; they perform it in German and Persian, both in Germany and Iran, at the Fadjr Festival, among others. At the 17th Hamedan Theater Festival ForChirldren&Adults 2010 it won several prices. Schreiber's book Ihr st\u00e4ndiger Begleiter (Her Constant Companion, subtitle: Fast eine Liebesgeschichte - Almost a Love Story) also draws on her personal history: It is the story of a young woman growing up in a strict and narrow-minded Christian community, as Schreiber did. The novel recounts the heroine's struggle to liberate herself from her pervading relationship with God, who constantly appears to her and with whom she converses familiarly. A Dutch translation of this book appeared in 2007. Her latest novel S\u00fc\u00df wie Schattenmorellen (Sweet as Morello Cherries) is a coming-of-age-story, most of it taking place in a cherry orchard. While in Emma\u2019s Luck Schreiber's topic was the end of life, she writes here about its beginning. A film of this book will be produced by Makido Production/Wien und Weimar, directed by Manuel Siebenmann. Together with him Claudia Schreiber is writing the script and again adopting her own novel."

She was the first woman military surgeon in Russia, the first woman professor of surgery, and the first woman to serve as a physician in the Imperial Palace of Russia. Following her involvement in a student movement, Gedroits was unable to complete her studies in Russia, and despite being openly lesbian, entered into a marriage of convenience, which allowed her to obtain a passport in another name and leave the country. In Switzerland, she enrolled in the medical courses of C\u00e9sar Roux and graduated in 1898, working as Roux\u2019s assistant, but returned to Russia because of illnesses in her family. As a young physician, Gedroits was concerned at the low standards of hygiene, nutrition and sanitation, and made recommendations to improve conditions. In the Russo-Japanese War, she performed abdominal surgeries against established policy, leading to a change in the way battlefield medicine was performed. Much decorated for her war service, she served as physician to the royal court until the outbreak of World War I, training the Tsarina Alexandra and her daughters as nurses. At the beginning of the Revolution, Gedroits returned to the battle front. Wounded, she was evacuated to Kiev, where she resumed her work as a physician and academic. In 1921, she was hired to teach pediatric surgery at the Kiev Medical Institute and within two years was appointed a professor of medicine. Soviet purges at that time removed her from office in 1930 and denied her a pension. Gedroits turned her attention to writing autobiographical novels until her death from uterine cancer in 1932."

        "content": "Vera Ignatievna Gedroits was born on 7 April 1870 O.S. in , (now in the Bryansk Oblast), in the Oryol Governorate of the Russian Empire. Her parents were Daria Konstantinovna Mikhau () and Prince Ignatiy Ignatievich Gedroits (). Her mother's family were Russified Germans and her maternal grandfather served as a captain in the military. Her father's family belonged to a Lithuanian princely clan which shared its origins with the more famous Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family. After having taken part in the Polish uprising of 1863, Ignatiy Gedroits fled to Russia when Lithuanian liberties were suspended by the autocracy. Establishing a tobacco plantation in the Non-Black Earth Region, he was later elected head of the Council of Magistrates in the Bryansk District, and in 1878 received confirmation of the title of prince for himself and his heirs. Gedroits was the middle child among five living siblings, Maria (1861), Ignatius (1864), Nadezhda (1876), and Alexandra (1878). Another brother, Sergei, of whom she was particularly fond, died young and would later inspire her literary pseudonym. Following Sergei's death, she developed an interest in medicine, vowing to become a doctor so that she could help to prevent suffering. The children, like their mother, were raised as Orthodox, but their father remained Catholic. They grew up on the family estate which was destroyed by fire in 1877, forcing them to move to a boarding house where their grandmother Natalia Mikhau taught the children reading, French, music, and dancing. The lively Vera Gedroits became the children's ringleader, often dressing in boys' clothes for convenience. Gedroits attended at the Bryansk women's gymnasium under Vasily Rozanov for a period but was expelled for mischief aimed at her teachers. Her father arranged with his industrialist friend  for her to be introduced to medicine as a factory assistant. Under Maltsov's influence, she was finally readmitted to the gymnasium, matriculating with honors in 1885. She continued her education in St. Petersburg, attending the medical courses of the anatomy professor Peter Lesgaft. While there, Gedroits became involved in the revolutionary youth movement, participating in the populist circle of Victor Alexandrovich Veynshtok. Along with other members of the group, she was arrested in 1892. The police returned her to Slobodishche."

        "content": "Keen to continue her studies, but unable to do so in Russia, Gedroits arranged a marriage of convenience with a friend from St. Petersburg, Nikolai Belozerov. Although Gedroits was openly lesbian, she and Belozerov actively corresponded, met frequently and traveled together. According to biographer Tatiana Khokhlova, the couple had real affection for each other. They took measures to hide their union, which occurred on 5 September 1894, by living separately. Belozerov's military career took him to Irkutsk in Siberia, while Gedroits used her new name to obtain a passport and slip into Switzerland. She entered the University of Lausanne, where she trained to be a surgeon in the clinic of professor C\u00e9sar Roux, graduating in 1898. Earning almost perfect marks, she received her diploma as a Doctor of Medicine and Surgery. Upon receipt of her diploma, Gedroits first worked as an intern in a therapy clinic, but was soon posted as a junior assistant to Roux. Carrying out scientific studies, she became Roux's senior assistant and he subsequently offered her the post of Privatdozent. Immersing herself in her work, Gedroits wrote that she was \"drowning in surgery\" in an attempt to comprehend all the subtleties of the procedures and how best to help her patients. She began an ardent lesbian affair, but was forced to return to Russia when she received a pleading letter from her father. He advised that her sister Alexandra had died from tuberculosis and her mother was suffering from nervous exhaustion. He urged her to return and assist him, promising to help her secure work in a new 10-bed factory hospital which was being built. Believing she had a responsibility to her family, she reluctantly returned to Slobodishche in 1900."

        "content": "On her return, Gedroits was immediately hired at the Maltsov Cement Factory in the Zhizdrinsky District of the Kaluga Oblast as the plant's physician. Though primarily responsible for the medical needs of the workers and their families, she tended to local villagers as well, as she was the only doctor in the district. By 1901, Gedroits had performed 248 operations with minimal fatalities, including amputations, herniation repair, and setting broken bones, many caused by the difficult working conditions of the laborers. Inadequate safety practices by the factory meant that there was a high risk of industrial accidents and the cement dust caused many eye problems. Poor living conditions with little sanitation, inadequate knowledge of hygiene and nutrition, and no midwifery care contributed to other serious health issues, such as dysentery. Concerned about the overall health of the workers, Gedroits made a list of recommendations for factory administrators, including cleaning the wells, providing washing tubs, and serving hot meals. In addition to her hospital work, Gedroits published scientific articles in Russian medical journals, which began to be noticed and reprinted in German and French. Invited to participate in the Third Congress of Surgeons in 1902, she presented a report on a surgery performed in 1901 on a male patient suffering from a deformation of the hip joints, which was so severe he could not stand or sit comfortably. Following a complex surgery, within four months the patient was able to walk without crutches. Her detailed report showed a thorough knowledge of surgical work of predecessors in the field, including John Rhea Barton, F. J. Gant, Bernhard von Langenbeck, Jules Germain Fran\u00e7ois Maisonneuve, and Richard von Volkmann. Wanting to leave the provincial life because of the difficult working conditions, the poverty of the workers, and family issues, Gedroits was required to attain Russian credentials to practice medicine elsewhere in Russia. In spite of her Swiss degree, she had to obtain certifications to meet the requirements of the University of Moscow. In 1902, she asked permission to test for the Latin requirement at the Oryol Gubernatorial Gymnasium. Having been under the watch of the police since her arrest in 1892, she was required to get a statement of character before the examination was allowed. After successfully passing her exams, Gedroits earned the title of female doctor and on 21 February 1903, received her diploma, allowing her to practice medicine throughout the country. The continuing ill-health of her parents, her long working hours, and the collapse of her relationship with her lover from Switzerland, led to a suicide attempt in 1903."

        "content": "In early 1904, with the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, Gedroits volunteered to go to the front with the Red Cross. In the first month of the war, she treated 1,255 patients, including over 100 patients with head wounds and 61 patients with abdominal wounds. Initially treatment was provided in tents covered in an insulating layer of clay, but by January 1905, Gedroits was accompanying the horse-drawn ambulances which brought the wounded to the hospital to perform triage, before entering the operating theater. She was appointed chief surgeon of the hospital train, which consisted of an operating car and five patient cars. The operating car was a specially equipped surgical unit, supplied by the Russian nobility to allow care to the wounded to be performed on the front lines. This put the medical personnel at grave risk, as unless there were wounded personnel in ambulances, tents or surgical trains, their neutrality was not recognized. Though many Russian, as well as French and British, military surgeons had discarded the idea of treating abdominal wounds, Gedroits recognized that early intervention was key. Standard treatment at the time required the patient to be placed in a semi-reclining position so that the wound could drain. In previous eras, without anesthesia, penetrating abdominal wounds were considered inoperable. Gedroits was the first to perform laparotomies on military patients, having extensive experience in abdominal surgery for hernias, the most frequent surgery she performed in the cement factory hospital. Her procedure required that the patient undergo the operation within three hours of receiving a wound. Her success rate was high, leading to recommendations being made in international medical journals to adopt mobile surgical units which allowed for rapid treatment. The Russian Army and the Russian Society of Military Doctors officially adopted Gedroits' operative procedures. Designed to treat 2,000 people, the nobles' hospital quickly exceeded its capacity and because it was on the front lines, mortality was high. With the Russian defeat, Gedroits helped organize the hospital evacuation from near the Fushun Mining region, which was performed under gunfire because the Russian troops refused to retreat until the patients were moved. Gedroits was credited with saving the life of Vasily Gurko, as well as that of a Japanese prince. In 1905, she returned to the Maltsov Factory Hospital as chief surgeon and was appointed chief doctor of the Lyudinovskaya Hospital. Compiling a 57-page report on her work during the war, which included illustrations, she presented her results on 27 July 1905 to the Society of Military Doctors. She was awarded the gold medal of diligence from the Order of Saint Anna by the army commander for her actions during the Battle of Mukden, the Ribbon of Saint George with the silver medal \"For Bravery\" (ru) by General N. Plinevich for her treatment of the wounded, the three highest distinctions from the Russian Red Cross, and recognition by the Royal family in the form of the silver neck medal of the Order of Saint Vladimir."

        "content": "Gedroits decided in 1905 to disentangle herself from her marriage and was divorced on 22 December 1905. Her maiden name and her noble title were restored on 1 February 1907. At the Maltsov factory, she continued to see many chronic diseases and began cataloguing the cases of bone tuberculosis, infection, and inguinal hernia for future scientific study. She recommended that special institutions designed to treat chronic patients be established. Gedroits published 17 scientific papers between 1902 and 1909. In addition to hernias and industrial injuries, her publications also covered surgeries for obstetrics, the thyroid gland, and various tumors which she had seen in her patients. Her operating experiences included abdominal and chest wounds, amputations, ectopic pregnancy, facial and tendon reconstructions, intestinal resection, hysterectomy, skull trepanation, and setting bones. The Lyudinovskaya Hospital was originally associated with the Lyudinovskaya Mining Plant, but was turned into a surgical hospital serving the nearby communities of the district. Gedroits utilized her Swiss education and battlefield experiences as a basis for bringing it up to modern European standards. She expanded the facility and equipped it with new surgical implements, including white gowns, threads, and gloves. She obtained apparatuses like the D'Arsonval and Tesla high-frequency current instruments and x-ray machines, promoted the use of ether rather than chloroform for anesthesia, and selected special garments for patients and their bed linens, all of which were innovative measures for her time. She also established a pathology and anatomy archive and cooperative agreements with Philip Markowitz Blumenthal's chemical and bacteriological institute on Lubyanka Square in Moscow to improve diagnostics. In addition to her work in the hospital, Gedroits made numerous housecalls, and over a five-year period, reported she had visited 125,363 patients. She received a municipal commendation from the City Council for her merits as a surgeon in 1908."

        "content": "In 1909, at the invitation of Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, Gedroits became the senior resident physician at the Tsarskoye Selo Court Hospital, \"with a salary of 2,100 rubles and a state apartment\". As the royal household's first female physician and the second-highest-ranking member of the hospital's staff, she headed the Departments of Surgery and Gynecology/Obstetrics, while acting as the attending physician for the royal children. As the only medical facility in Tsarskoye Selo, the Court Hospital functioned as a city hospital, with a surgery, a therapeutic department, and an isolation wing for infectious patients. To ensure that they had reference materials, she wrote a textbook for the royals, \u0411\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0434\u044b \u043e \u0445\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0438 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0439 (Conversations on Surgery for Sisters and Doctors), addressing general surgical problems in laymen's terms. Taking advantage of her position, Gedroits made no attempt to conceal her lesbian inclinations and spoke of herself using masculine verb forms. One biographer, Svetlana Maire, indicated that these manifestations could well have been an attempt to assert her authority as a professional in a male-dominated field. Dressing almost exclusively in men's trousers and suits, she favored a style similar to Feodor Chaliapin's portrait with a beaver hat and a sable fur. She also spoke in a deep-pitched voice and frequently smoked. Besides her appearance, she began seeking the acquaintance and company of literary figures. In her youth, Gedroits had published a collection of poems in 1887, but now she joined the Poets' Guild, publishing her poems under the pen name Sergei Gedroits in such journals as Bright Light, Covenants, and The Theosophical Gazette, among others. Her cultural companions included her former professor, Vassili Rozanov; writers such as Nikolai Gumilev, Razumnik Ivanov-Razumnik, and Aleksey Remizov; and the artist Julius von Klever. In 1910, Gedroits privately published the anthology \u0421\u0442\u0438\u0445\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043a\u0438 (Poems and Fairytales) in St Petersburg, and though the critical response was not enthusiastic, that same year she published \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b \u0438\u0437 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0430 (Pages from the Life of a Factory Doctor). Interested in providing support for young writers, in 1911, she paid half the costs to establish the journal \u0413\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439 (Hyperborea). In parallel, Gedroits was compiling a thesis based on research from her factory days. She successfully earned her doctorate of surgery, the first woman to achieve the distinction from the University of Moscow, on 11 May 1912, after defending her thesis \u041e\u0442\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u0440\u044b\u0436 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0420\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 268 \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439 (Long-term results of inguinal hernia operations using the protocol of Professor Roux based upon 268 operations). The thesis was dedicated to Roux and , a Russian surgeon who had been supportive to her work. She published a second volume of poetry, \u0412\u0435\u0433 (Veg, representing the beginning letters of her names and possibly inspired by the German Weg meaning \"way\") in 1913. Once again the critical response, though improved, noted the lassitude and lack of passion in the verse. Her Chinese Tales was published in Precepts magazine in 1913 and a collection of folk poems titled the Red Angel was published in 1914. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Gedroits worked on equipping the hospital and preparing the staff for war. For example, nurses first learned how to dress wounds and prepare the various bandages, dressings, and equipment that would be needed for treatment, before being trained for surgical support. She taught nursing techniques to the Tsarina and her daughters, Olga and Tatiana, and they became assistants to her in her surgical operations. One of the other nurses she trained at Tsarskoye Selo, Countess Maria Dmitrievna Nirod, would later become Gedroits' life-long partner. Raising funds from the nobles, the hospital was equipped to enable rapid treatment, so that soldiers would not have to be sent to Petrograd, as St. Petersburg was now known. Working with Eugene Botkin and Sergey Vilchievsky, she established networks linking infirmaries and supply trains, and planned evacuation routes for the wounded. By the end of 1914, Gedroits was mainly involved in serving as the palace physician. Though treating war wounded and giving nursing courses, she was called into service to treat a patient who had a riding accident on the palace grounds, a noblewoman injured in a train crash, as well as the staff of the tsarina. Her favor with the Tsarina gave her some measure of protection, as she had little patience with Rasputin. Despite this favor, however, one of Gedroits' few medical failures shook the Tsarina's confidence when her favorite maid of honor Anna Vyrubova's treatment was unsuccessful, for although Vyrubova recovered she walked afterward with a limp. Gedroits did have enough influence left to garner a transfer of Nikolai Gumilev from  to the . Periodically, Gedroits would go to the front to compensate for the absence of other surgeons. In one episode in 1916, she performed over 30 operations, mostly trepannings, over a three-day period. When the February Revolution began in 1917, Gedroits, as an employee of the Tsar, could not openly support the Russian Provisional Government. In order to remain neutral in the conflict, while still honoring her friendship with the royal family, she chose to return to work as a military doctor. Having worked for the Tsar, it would have been very unsafe to remain in Petrograd after Tsar Nicholas abdicated. Aged 44, she altered the birth information in her passport and was appointed as chief physician for the 6th Siberian Rifle Regiment. Sent to the front, she served the wounded at the Battle of Galicia in June and July 1917 and was then transferred to the 5th Siberian Rifle Corps as a divisional surgeon, a rank comparable to lieutenant colonel in the Imperial Russian Army. During the demobilization after the October Revolution, Gedroits was injured in January 1918 and taken to a military hospital in the Pechersk neighborhood of Kiev."

        "content": "While recuperating, Gedroits moved in with Countess Nirod, with whom she lived for the remainder of her days. Initially they lived in an apartment on Kruglouniversitetskaya Street, according to their neighbor, Irina Avdiyeva, as a married couple. She published two poems in the Banner of Labor in 1918, \u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f (The Temptation of St. Anthony) and \u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b (Galician Stories), which reflected on her war impressions. As soon as she was able to return to work, Gedroits began working in the hospital of the  and by 1919 had established a clinic to perform maxillofacial surgery. In 1920, when the Kiev Medical Institute organized a surgery department, she was invited by  to join the faculty. In 1921, she began working as an external lecturer, teaching a course on pediatric surgery. She was appointed as a professor of medicine in 1923 and entered a period of publishing as an academic surgeon. In 1924, she published a paper on nutrition and in 1928 wrote an article on surgical procedures for treating tuberculosis in the knee. She published a textbook on pediatric surgery; wrote extensively for surgical journals with articles on surgery, endocrinology and oncology; and participated in surgical conferences. In 1929, following Tcherniakhovsky's arrest, Gedroits became the departmental head of surgery. But the following year, during the Soviet purge, she was removed from her post and denied a pension. Using funds she had saved, she purchased a house on the outskirts of Kiev, where she and Nirod moved together. Continuing to work as a surgeon from time to time at the Intercession Monastery's hospital, she devoted the next two years to writing, publishing a series of fictionalized autobiographies. The Publishing House of Writers in Leningrad published three of the works of her series \u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c (Life)\u2014\u041a\u0430\u0444\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043a (The Little Caftan), \u041b\u044f\u0445 (The Pole), and \u041e\u0442\u0440\u044b\u0432 (The Separation)\u2014in 1931. Unlike her epic poems, which were labeled \"\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\" (especially unpleasant), Gedroits' prose, was called \"outstanding\". Konstantin Fedin compared her autobiographical works to those of Boris Pasternak. Two other works from this period, \u0428\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044c (Shaman) and \u0421\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0447 (Tornado), were found in the archives of Razumnik Ivanov-Razumnik, which indicate at least one, Shaman, was published. It is also thought that the novel \u0412\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u044b (Far from the Homeland) is one of her works. Published in Leningrad in 1926, it is about her Swiss teacher C\u00e9sar Roux."

She left her personal papers to her neighbors, the painters Irina Avdiyeva and her husband Leonid Povolotsky. During the purges of 1937\u20131938, the couple's apartment was raided and Gedroits' papers were discovered. One of them was a letter from her professor, C\u00e9sar Roux, advising he had bequeathed to Gedroits the Department of Surgery at the University of Geneva. Based upon the letter, the couple were accused of imperialism and Povolotsky was forcibly disappeared. Gedroits challenged established medical procedure at the beginning of the 20th century and her success with abdominal wound treatment played a part in changing international military medical policy. She is remembered as a pioneer in applying laparotomy for the treatment of abdominal wounds on the battlefront. She was one of Russia's first women to work as a surgeon, the first woman to become a professor of surgery, the first woman to work as a military doctor, and the first woman to serve as a doctor in the imperial palace. The hospital in Fokino, Bryansk Oblast was named in Gedroits' honor and a memorial plaque was dedicated to her memory in front of the former Tsarskoe Selo palace hospital in Pushkin, Saint Petersburg."

Pomeroy notes that Paxson had a masterful knowledge of political history and \"found the political framework, among other conventional frameworks, indispensable in telling a general story.\"  However Paxson also insisted on the importance of economic and social history and had himself published on such  subjects as the rise of sport and the highway movement.

After publishing his dissertation in 1903 on American foreign policy regarding the independence of the South American republics in the 1820s, he moved away from diplomatic issues to Western studies. He started with a series of studies on Colorado, planning a book that was never finished. He then moved to broader narrative histories of the frontier, culminating with his prize-winning  History of the American Frontier, 1763-1893 in  1924. It covers a very wide sweep of topics, with unusual strength in handling violent relations between the frontiersman and the Indians. Paxson emphasized the impact on people of the process of moving to the west, downplaying the static aspects of specific localities.

        "content": "McKusick started with BSD by virtue of the fact that he shared an office at Berkeley with Bill Joy, who spearheaded the beginnings of the BSD system. Some of his largest contributions to BSD have been to the file system. He helped to design the original Berkeley Fast File System (FFS). In the late 1990s, he implemented soft updates, an alternative approach to maintaining disk integrity after a crash or power outage, in FFS, and a revised version of Unix File System (UFS) known as \"UFS2\". The magic number used in the UFS2 super block structure reflects McKusick's birth date: #define FS_UFS2_MAGIC 0x19540119 (as found in /usr/include/ufs/ffs/fs.h on FreeBSD systems). It is included as an easter egg. He was also primarily responsible for creating the complementary features of filesystem snapshots and background fsck (file system check and repair), which both integrate closely with soft updates.  After the filesystem snapshot, the filesystem can be brought up immediately after a power outage, and fsck can run as a background process. The Design and Implementation series of books are regarded as very high-quality works in computer science. They have been influential in the development of the BSD descendants.  The BSD Daemon, often used to identify BSD, is copyrighted by Marshall Kirk McKusick."

Born probably in Moray, he went to France in his youth, receiving a bachelorate in civil law from the University of Paris by 1396 and in canon law by 1407. His education was partly paid for by the prebend of Duffus and a grant from Alexander Bur, Bishop of Moray, taken by Bur from the judicial profits of his diocese. During Innes' study period, he was also pursuing an ecclesiastical career, being Archdeacon of Caithness from 1396 until 1398, and Dean of Ross, from some point between 1396 and 1398 until 1407. He gave up the latter position in that year, having been elected as Bishop of Moray sometime in late 1406, and receiving consecration from Pope Benedict XIII in either Italy or southern France in the following January. Innes was bishop for over seven years, and died at Elgin on 2 August 1414. Innes has been traditionally credited with supervising much of the rebuilding to Elgin Cathedral. The historian David Ditchburn believes Innes was an ally, and possibly even a client, of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, and perhaps his father Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, the latter of whom was the warlord responsible for burning down Elgin Cathedral during the episcopate of Alexander Bur."

        "content": "Michael Kast Rist (18 December 1948 \u2013 18 September 1983), commonly known as Miguel Kast, was a German-born Chilean economist of the Chicago Boys group. He served as Minister of State and President of the Central Bank under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. In his youth, he was a member of the Christian Democratic Party. Kast was born to Michael Kast, a German lieutenant and Nazi who fled to Chile from Germany in 1950 after escaping American custody, and Olga Rist, whom his father had met in Bavaria while on the run. Upon getting his master's degree in economics at the University of Chicago, Kast joined Odeplan (1973), the state agency that led many public policy and economic changes after 1973. At Odeplan, Kast focused most of his energies on creating the \"map of extreme poverty\", which would become the cornerstone of Chile's social development programs. In 1978 he became the head of Odeplan and used his position to involve young professionals in the struggle against poverty by making them join Odeplan and by sending them to the country's outer regions to get insight into the real problems affecting Chile. In 1980, Kast became Labor Minister under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. In April 1982, aged 33, he became President of the Central Bank of Chile. This was a complicated moment in Chile's economy; the exchange rate was fixed at 39 pesos per dollar and Chile's large economic groups had liabilities with their own banks. As a central banker, he worked to reduce the level of related loans, which were loans made to the owners of the banks. He created a mechanism called the \"Portfolio Sale\" through which the Central Bank could buy high risk credits to commercial banks. By keeping a fixed exchange rate of 39 pesos per dollar, Kast hoped to protect local companies that had liabilities in dollars. However the central authority saw otherwise. On 13 June 1982, the peso was devalued, which created a loss of international reserves. Kast decided in August 1982 to completely free the exchange rate, further devaluing the peso and bringing new intervention from the central authority. Under this new threat of instability, Kast resigned from the Central Bank on 2 September. Kast left government life in late 1982 and dedicated himself to the business world and his professorship at Chile's Pontifical Catholic University. Around this time he began to feel unwell, developing signs of physical weakness and a pale appearance. In January 1983 he was diagnosed with bone cancer, which claimed his life on 18 September 1983. He was 34 years old."

He was a disciple of Ivan Minayev, the founder of Russian Indology. Sergey Feodorovitch Oldenburg was born in Russia on 26 September 1863, in Byankino, Transbaikal Oblast. His father was of the Livonian nobility; his grandfather was a full general in the Imperial Russian Army. During the 1880s while at St. Petersburg University Oldenburg participated in the Scientific-Literary Association of Students, a brotherhood which shared liberal and radical ideals. Here he met Aleksandr Ulyanov as they were both in the inner circle of this organisation. Ulyanov dropped out of the inner circle when he started to plan an assassination attempt on the life of emperor Alexander III. The attempt failed, and following the execution of Ulyanov in 1887, his brother, Vladimir Lenin visited Oldenburg in Saint Petersburg in 1891. Oldenburg had just returned from a two-year trip to London, Paris, and Cambridge. Oldenburg was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1900, and he served as its permanent Secretary from 1904 to 1929. From 1905 he became active in the Imperial Russian Geographical Society. In 1909\u201310 and 1914\u201315, he travelled in central Asia, where he discovered Sanskrit texts. He instigated scientific expeditions to Tibet and Dzungaria, which brought to light unique Buddhist manuscripts. To publish newly found manuscripts, in 1897 Oldenburg launched an authoritative edition of Buddhist texts, Bibliotheca Buddhica, which continues to this day. Oldenburg joined the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) in 1905; he served as a member of the State Council of Imperial Russia from 1912 to 1917. Following the February Revolution of 1917 he served in the Russian Provisional Government as Minister of Education. He set up the Commission for the Study of the Tribal Composition of the Population of the Borderlands of Russia at this time. Unlike his Kadet colleagues, he stayed in Russia after the October Revolution brought the Bolsheviks to power. Based on his acquaintance with Vladimir Lenin, he was able to develop an alliance between the Bolsheviks and Russian ethnographers, the former being more interested in nationalism amongst European peoples of the former Russian Empire, the ethnographers focusing more on the national question amongst its Asian peoples. Although he was briefly imprisoned by the Cheka in 1919, Oldenburg served as permanent secretary of the Academy of Sciences until 1929, when the Communist Party ousted hundreds of staff for resisting Bolshevization. Oldenburg devoted the remainder of his life to administrating the Soviet Institute of Oriental Studies, whose antecedent (the Asian Museum) he had directed since 1916. He died on 28 February 1934 in St Petersburg. His granddaughter Zo\u00e9 Oldenbourg became a well-known French novelist and historian."

        "content": "Tauro was born in Lynn, Massachusetts to an Italian immigrant cobbler and his wife. He graduated from Lynn public schools and attended Boston University's College of Business Administration for a year before switching to its law school. He received his law degree in 1927. Admitted to the bar that year, he practiced in Lynn until 1961, when he became an associate Superior Court justice. Tauro's 1961 appointment was made by his longtime friend and business associate, Governor John A. Volpe. A practicing attorney in Lynn, Tauro had for many years been general counsel and a director for Volpe Construction Co. At the time of his appointment to a judgeship, he was the newly elected governor's legal counsel at the State House. The next year, Judge Tauro became chief justice of the Superior Court. A short, compact man with dark brown eyes, a brush mustache, and wavy, snow white hair, he was noted during his years on the bench for his competence, courtesy, diligence, and preparation. Aware of the caseloads crushing Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) justices, he had advocated establishment of an intermediate appellate court to permit the high court to concentrate on cases of broad social impact. Within two years of his 1970 appointment by Governor Francis W. Sargent to the position of Chief Justice, Judge Tauro brought the project to fruition and the Appeals Court was established. He also worked to modernize state civil law and he wrote many decisions now considered landmarks in a variety of fields - contracts, torts, real property, corporations, governmental regulations and environmental protection. Tauro was the first Italian American and Roman Catholic to hold the position of Chief Justice of the SJC. During his fourteen years on the bench, he made more than one landmark decision, including one that effectively abolished the death penalty in Massachusetts. \"The state should not be in the business of taking lives,\" he said. The only person to serve as chief justice of both the Supreme Judicial Court and the Superior Court, he also became, upon his retirement in 1976, the first Chief Justice in the Supreme Judicial Court's long history to retire at age 70 in accordance with the 98th Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution, adopted in 1972. A resident of Swampscott, he died at Salem Hospital. He was survived by his wife of 64 years, Helen M. (n\u00e9e Petrossi); a son, Judge Joseph Louis Tauro; two brothers, Arthur L. and Raymond; and a sister, Celia Tricca. He is predeceased by his brother Dr. Antonio Tauro and his sister Carol A. Gioacchini."

He was educated at Roxburgh public school, and Victoria College, Wellington. He later won a Vans Dunlop scholarship to study botany and zoology at the University of Edinburgh. He transferred to medicine and graduated with an MB ChB in 1912, with first-class honours, and then undertook a research scholarship, receiving a Diploma in Public Health (DPH) in 1913. Following a short period in general practice, Smith became an assistant in at the University of Edinburgh department of forensic medicine at the suggestion of Professor Henry Harvey Littlejohn. He obtained his doctorate (MD) in 1914 with a gold medal, and also won the Alison Prize. Smith returned to New Zealand in 1914 and took up a post as Medical Officer of Health for Otago at Dunedin. During World War I, Smith served as a major in the New Zealand Army Corps. In 1917, Smith took up a post as medico-legal advisor to the Government of Egypt and senior lecturer in forensic medicine at the School of Medicine in Cairo. Smith went on to establish himself as an authority in the field of ballistics and firearms in forensic medicine, publishing the first edition of Textbook of Forensic Medicine in 1925. In 1928, Smith was appointed to the Regius Chair of forensic medicine at the University of Edinburgh. In 1929 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker, Ralph Allan Sampson, Thomas James Jehu and James Ritchie. In 1931 he became Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, a post he held until 1953 (succeeded by Professor Thomas J Mackie). During his period as Dean, in response to Polish medical students seeking refuge in Scotland, he was prominent in the discussions which led to the creation of the Polish School of Medicine in  Edinburgh in 1941. He was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta (OPR) by the Polish government after the war. The school was disbanded in 1949. Smith was Rector of the University of Edinburgh from 1954 to 1957.

        "content": "Smith's first important forensic case was the 1913 trial of Patrick Higgins for the murder of his two sons in Winchburgh, Scotland, known as the Hopetoun Quarry murders. Because of the build-up of adipocere in the bodies, a result of their being immersed in a cold flooded quarry, Littlejohn and Smith were able to provide important evidence in the trial, leading to the conviction and execution of Higgins. The two scientists' famous work gained notoriety 94 years later, when a relative of the boys asked for the return of specimens taken from their remains from the University of Edinburgh, for a proper burial. Research revealed that after their work on the case, Littlejohn and Smith had removed parts of the bodies from police custody to use as scientific specimens, as described in Smith's autobiography, according to Chris Paton in The Scotsman. In January 2008, the University agreed to return the remains, if the claimant could establish her relationship and the other relatives all agreed. In 1935, Smith was one of the forensic experts involved in the identification of the bodies of the victims of Buck Ruxton, using a novel technique of forensic anthropology to superimpose a photograph over the X-ray of a victim's skull. Also in 1935, while on holiday in Australia, he was called to give evidence in the infamous Shark Arm case. In 1937, Smith produced a profile of the Falkirk cat burglar, using a pair of shoes, predating the field of forensic podiatry. One obituary of Smith recounted an incident in which he was brought \"three small bones thought to belong to an animal\", and from these was able to determine that they belonged to \"a woman aged between 23 and 25 who had died three months earlier. She had at least one pregnancy, walked with a limp and was killed by a home-made shotgun slug\"."

        "content": "Margita \"Magi\" Stefanovi\u0107 (; 1 April 1959 \u2013 18 September 2002) was a Serbian musician best known as a keyboardist of Serbian rock band Ekatarina Velika (EKV). Born in Belgrade, she was the only child of well-known theatre and television director Slavoljub Stefanovi\u0107-Ravassi and Desanka Nikoli\u0107. After finishing elementary school, Margita enrolled in the \"Josip Slavenski\" music high school from which she graduated as the most talented pianist in her class alongside Ivo Pogoreli\u0107. Her impressive school performance led to an offer of further studies at the famed Moscow Conservatory, which she ended up turning down due to family reasons\u2014her mother very much disliked the idea of letting her go to Moscow by herself at such a young age. Instead, Margita enrolled at the University of Belgrade's School of Architecture where she was no less successful. Throughout her architecture studies she still continued practicing the piano as well as playing and occasionally touring with various small orchestras. After graduating university in 1982, along with her then-boyfriend Sr\u0111an Vejvoda, she began to take an interest in Belgrade's underground music scene, which struck her as a completely different lifestyle from the one she was used to. During the spring of 1982 she was introduced to Milan Mladenovi\u0107 by her cousin Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107. Soon thereafter, at one of Katarina II's early rehearsals, she got an offer to join the band. After returning from a three-month trip to South America she decided to take the still-standing offer, joining Katarina II in late 1982. Margita was Katarina II/Ekatarina Velika's member until its very end in late 1994. During her time with the band she also collaborated on the albums of many other Yugoslav bands such as Karlowy Vary produced by Tomo in der M\u00fchlen, Elvis J. Kurtovi\u0107 & His Meteors, Van Gogh, Babe, etc. She composed the score for several TV films (\"Prvi put s ocem na jutrenje\", \"Vera Hofmanova\", \"Povratak Vuka Alimpi\u0107a\", \"Plavi plavi\") and theatre productions (\"Klasni neprijatelj\", \"Tri sestre\"). In 1985 she was introduced as an actress (the role of Dragana) in the movie \"Tajvanska kanasta\" (The Taiwan Canasta) directed by Goran Markovi\u0107. After Milan's death and Ekatarina Velika's end, Magi continued her work as a musician. During 1994/1995 she played in a band called Kurajberi, which gathered several Belgrade musicians and was focused mainly on performing covers at club gigs and jam sessions. In 1995, with a group of young Belgrade musicians involved in a techno movement, she formed a band called EQV and released an album Ti si sav moj bol (You are All of My Anguish) named after the famous Ekatarina Velika song, the album itself containing a techno version of the same song. The album was published by the Austrian label Coop Arts & Crafts Unlimited. In October of the same year, EQV participated in Tactic Festival in Vienna. She further continued contributing as a guest star on albums and concerts of many Serbian bands and occasionally played with bands Glisers, Zion banda and Direktori. Magi played keyboards in Belgrade's band \"The Glissers\" 1995. and 1996. They performed on a weekly basis and released a CD \"The Glissers Vol. 1\" for IMAGO Records. She also designed the cover for it. In 2019. it came out in vinyl form as an Album The Glissers for Yugovinyl and BIVECO. In 1996 she played several unplugged concerts with Elektri\u010dni orgazam, one of which was recorded and released the same year by B92 as \u017divo i akusti\u010dno (Live and Acoustic). During that time she was also involved in several significant music projects (\"S one strane duge\", \"Pesme iznad Istoka i Zapada\"). Sometime in 1996 Margita became a member of Ars Antibari writers society from Bar, which published several of her stories in two books (\"Izgleda da \u0107e Jugo\", Bar, 1996, and \"Da li da ti ka\u017eem ko te je ubio, Gea?\", Belgrade, 1999). In 2002 she composed the music for \"Kaput mrtvog \u010doveka\" (The Coat of a Dead Man) theater play directed by Hajdana Baleti\u0107, which turned out to be Magi's last music-related work. However, from 1996 onwards her life was mostly spent struggling with heroin addiction and the physical effects of long-term drug use. Following the passing of her father in February 1996, Margita's drug problems intensified. In order to support her habit, she sold pretty much all of her possessions including an apartment in downtown Belgrade. She used part of the money for a trip to India and also to buy two smaller apartments. Not long thereafter she sold those as well and eventually ended up living in a ramshackle modified garage in the suburb of Bor\u010da. By this time she was basically penniless, depending on charity and handouts for even the basics such as food. Margita Stefanovi\u0107 spent the last months of her life living in a homeless shelter in Vo\u017edovac. She was diagnosed to be HIV positive, which she contracted through intravenous drug use. She died on 18 September 2002 (aged 43) at the Belgrade Hospital for Infective Diseases where she had been sequestered since August of the same year."

The graffiti was written on the wall of her apartment building, and it said \"Margita je de\u010dak\" (\"Margita is a boy\"), implying that she was an atypical girl of the era. The graffiti was sprayed by Neboj\u0161a Krsti\u0107, at the time a member of the Serbian new wave band VIS Idoli.

        "content": "In 1989, Hawley became the fourth museum director of Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts. Hawley made it her mission to ensure that the institution would not only preserve Isabella Stewart Gardner\u2019s extraordinary collection, but also serve as a dynamic cultural resource for artists, musicians, scholars, visitors, and the Greater Boston community, just as it did in Mrs. Gardner\u2019s day. Modeled after a Venetian palazzo, the galleries surround a verdant courtyard and are home to paintings, sculptures, textiles, furniture, books, journals and letters, that seek to inspire generations of artists and visitors.  Included in the collection are masterpieces by Rembrandt, Raphael, Titian, Michelangelo, Whistler, and Sargent. Hawley expanded the Museum\u2019s staff and board of trustees; created curatorial positions and a board of overseers; mounted scholarly exhibitions centered on the art from the collection; established an Artist-in-Residency program and showcased the artists\u2019 work; launched new programs in music, education, and landscape; spearheaded the modernization of crucial infrastructure improvements in the historic palace; completed several full\u2013gallery restorations and led successful fundraising efforts to give the Museum a solid endowment. As part of a $180 million capital campaign, she oversaw the effort to build an addition designed by Pritzker Architecture Prize-winning architect Renzo Piano. The new wing, opened in January 2012, helps to preserve the historic palace and provides space for programming and services relevant to today\u2019s museum visitors. Hawley\u2019s book, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum: Daring by Design, published in 2014, describes the Museum\u2019s unique history and the process of designing the new addition with Piano. On March 18, 1990, within 6 months of Hawley taking the director position, two thieves, dressed as Boston police officers, talked their way into the Museum and stole 13 masterpieces valued at $500 million, including works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Manet, and Degas. It is the largest art theft in the world and still remains unsolved. In conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, the investigation is active and focused on recovering the art.  In 1994 at Hawley\u2019s urging, Senator Ted Kennedy helped pass legislation that made art theft a federal crime and increased the statute of limitations from five to fifteen years. As a result of her 26-year leadership, the legacy of the museum\u2019s founder in patronage and innovation continues to thrive in programs that explore new ideas and thinking across all the arts \u2013 including the widely celebrated Artist-in-Residence program and the popular classical music Sunday Series \u2013 and serves as the basis for scholarly exhibitions and symposia, school and community partnerships and a wide array of public and family programs. In December 2015, Hawley stepped down as the museum director."

Under her leadership, the state arts agency grew to the second largest arts council in the country ($23 million annually) and administered the widest array of public programs from finance to international exchange."

        "content": "Around 1890, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski started working with Gazeta Narodowa [National Newspaper], a Galician daily newspaper closely linked to the Eastern Galician conservatives (the so-called Podolacy). Between 1890 and 1892, he served as deputy editor-in-chief and manager of the paper. In 1896, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski tried to run as an independent candidate in the supplementary elections to the National Sejm (Parliament) in Lw\u00f3w, but was defeated In 1897 Przegl\u0105d Wszechpolski [The All-Polish Review] printed his work entitled \"Economic Development and National Culture\" (1 April 1897, No. 7). Soon after, the paper started publishing his other work. In 1897, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski became part of the National Democracy Party. However, he was not admitted to the National League, possibly because he opposed their illegal activity. From 1901 onwards, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski published in S\u0142owo Polskie [Polish Word], where he promoted the building of a national-democratic group in the Austrian partition. In 1903, using the structures of the National League, OKN and , G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski joined in organising National Democracy in Eastern Galicia. On 6 January 1904, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski held a meeting in his flat with , Jan Ludwik Pop\u0142awski, ,  and the Galician democrats  and . The men decided to set up the Galician National Democratic Party  (NDP). On 17 January 1904, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski participated in the First Congress of the NDP in Galicia. He became a member of the statutory (programme and organisation) committee and the so-called \"tighter\" committee - the one from Lw\u00f3w. He was one of the co-organizers of the Second NDP Congress, which took place in Lw\u00f3w on 8\u20139 December 1905. He was elected the president of the party. In 1902, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski won a seat in the elections to the Council of State (he held it continuously until 1918). He spoke on Polish-Ukrainian relations, the budget, financial and economic policy, the reform of electoral law for parliament and the National Sejm, railway reform.  He defended the Polish character of the University of Lw\u00f3w ). In addition, he advocated the need to expand Galicia's autonomy, which he expressed in his brochure  The Idea of Independence and Galicia's Finances (1902). G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski also took part in the work of the program committee of the Polish Circle (he co-wrote the economic program). G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski was the president of the Polish Circle (12 November 1907 \u2013 9 January 1911); later he was one of the vice-presidents; he was also the president of the NDP parliamentary club and the president and later the vice-president of the Joint Delegation to the Imperial Council in Austria and the Hungarian Parliament. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski was in favor of extending political and economic autonomy for Galicia. During the negotiations on electoral reform for the Council of State, he was the Circle committee's electoral law specialist, and also took part in negotiations with the Government. Like most of the members of the Circle, he was regarded as an opponent of the four-party electoral system. After the electoral reform to the State Council was passed, he took part in the negotiations on electoral reform to the National Sejm as a member of the electoral reform commission. On 20 September 1908, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski was elected the chairman of the new commission, but on 28 December 1910 he resigned from the commission in the Sejm, and on 12 January 1911 from its chairmanship. He also spoke on budgetary, fiscal and financial matters, as well as on education. He fought the national demands of Ukrainians, and spoke out against strikes and slogans for far-reaching social reforms raised by socialists. Between 1904 and 1918, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski was a member of the National Sejm, and between 1910 and 1918 a member of the Bukovina Sejm. He worked in three committees: the Tax Committee, the Budget Committee, and the Railway Committee. In the Sejm (as well as in his journalistic texts), G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski dealt with the railways, taxes, finance, education, and sought to extend the scope of Galician autonomy. In 1906-1907, throughout Galicia, the NDP (including G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski) organised about 200 political rallies, during which they called for a reform of electoral law, \"separation\" of Galicia, liberating it from economic dependence on Vienna, and gaining legislative independence. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski opposed the so-called Blok Namiestnikowski (Governor\u2019s Bloc) created by Micha\u0142 Bobrzy\u0144ski. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski opposed the plans of the new Governor to conclude a Polish-Ukrainian agreement . He demanded that a Polish - national state of ownership be maintained in Galicia. He participated in works on a new national program for Galicia. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski advocated broadening the scope of powers of the National Sejm. increasing the powers of the National School Council and establishing a special National Administrative Court at the Governor's Office. In 1910. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski was considered as a possible minister for Galicia. However, his candidature met with immediate opposition from Bobrzy\u0144ski. Instead, he took up the post of Minister for Railways in Bienerth's cabinet. As minister, against the stance of the Viennese financial and political circles (including the military), he decentralised and commercialised the railways, and polonised the administration in Galicia. Between 1912 and 1913, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski worked to establish a People's National Coalition. As a result, in September 1913, the National Christian and People's Union was established. Despite this success, his position in the structures was not stable. The national democratic movement underwent internal decomposition. Secession was made by the \"Fronda\" group within the \"Zet\" brothers, demanding independence from LN and SDN. In 1908-1909 another group of dissenters formed - the so-called \"Rzeczpospolita\" group. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski was still perceived as the leader of the Galician NDP, but SDN was led by the tandem of Stanis\u0142aw Grabski and Jan Gwalbert Pawlikowski. Before the outbreak of World War I, in opposition to the activists of National Democracy from the Congress Kingdom, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski advocated a loyal policy towards Austria-Hungary (he was skeptical about the orientation towards Russia, and was also seen as a critic of neo-Slavism). However, the decisions taken at the SDN conventions of May 1910 and March 1912 maintained Roman Dmowski's strategy."

        "content": "On 28 July 1914. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski took part in the establishment of the so-called Committee for the Implementation of the \"Unification and Independence of the Polish Lands\" - then in the Central National Committee established in Lw\u00f3w.  As a delegate, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski took part in talks in Vienna with Count Leopold Berchtold, Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, and General Franz Conrad Hotzendorf, Chief of General Staff, regarding the creation of a Polish army. However, the talks ended in a fiasco. After the formation of the Supreme National Committee, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski became its member, but after a conflict with the socialists (also over the oath of the Eastern Legion), he resigned. After Lw\u00f3w was occupied by the Imperial Russian Army, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski moved to Vienna, where he was very active in the Polish Circle for the Polish cause. In 1915, he established contact with the Central Polish Agency in Lausanne, headed by Erazm Piltz (a former member of the Party for Real Politics from the Kingdom of Poland) and Marian Seyda (a member of the LN and SDN board in the Prussian partition). He supported the agency by sending texts and expert opinions on economic policy, national economics and commentaries on current political events. In the same year, he also established close cooperation with the \"Rok Polski\u201d [Polish Year] - a magazine promoting national ideas. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski also participated in a series of programme and discussion meetings with activists from the Inter-Party Political Circle in the Kingdom of Poland, seeking to build a broader agreement with the agrarian members of the PSL \"Piast\" and other circles and groups of the political centre-right. In Galicia, such a half-hearted agreement was reached in July 1917. At that time the SDN, PSL Piast and the National Union set up the Inter-Party Union. After the proclamation of the Act of 5th November 1916 announcing the creation of a Polish state from the Russian partition (occupied by German troops), G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski started to clearly distance himself from Austria-Hungary. Among other things, he announced a project on behalf of the Polish Circle in Vienna, which counteracted the imperial plans to separate Galicia and create the Kingdom of Lesser Poland, subordinated to the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski belonged to the initiators of the so-called May Resolutions passed by the Polish Circle and the Polish Sejm Circle, which announced the construction of a united, independent Poland with access to the sea. Conservatives remained opposed, which led to the break-up of the coalition within the Polish Circle (4th November1917) and the departure of the National Democrats in March 1918. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski consistently spoke out publicly against Austrian policy, e.g. in the context of the Brest Peace Treaty (on 23 January 1918, he submitted an interpellation on this matter to the Prime Minister Ernest Seidler, and protested in a letter signed to the Emperor. He argued that the Brest Peace was an act contrary to international law and the provisions of the London Conference of 1879, and announced that he would send orders and decorations, including the Leopold Order, back to the Emperor in protest). On 2 October 1918, in the State Council, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski, Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski and Tadeusz Tertil presented a motion attacking the pro-Austrian policy of the conservatives. He again announced the building of a united and independent Poland with access to the sea. He submitted a motion to the State Council to establish a Polish-Austrian-Hungarian Liquidation Commission, which was to deal with abolishing the occupation and handing over Galicia and Cieszyn Silesia to Poland. In the spring of 1918, as an SDN delegate, he held talks with Czech politicians (in Prague) on the issue of Cieszyn Silesia, and together with Aleksander Skarbek took part in the Conference of South Slavs in Ljubljana, Slovenia."

        "content": "G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski entered J\u00f3zef \u015awie\u017cy\u0144ski's government as Minister of Foreign Affairs (23 October 1918 \u2013 4 November 1918), which was discounted by the NDP leaders. At a meeting of the SDN leadership in Lw\u00f3w, on 30 October 1918, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski explained that entering the government appointed by the Regency Council, which he had criticised earlier, was fully justified, as the Council had gained full sovereignty by virtue of the Address of 7 October. He also believed that 7th October 1918, and not 11 November, should seen as the date on which Poland regained independence. As a Minister, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski sent telegrams to all the partitioning states, informing them of the breaking of ties with the occupying authorities on the territory of the Kingdom of Poland. He also prepared a draft of the 5-adjectives\u2019 election law, which was later adopted by the government of J\u0119drzej Moraczewski. He also took part in the organisational work of the Krak\u00f3w-based Polish Liquidation Commission and the Lw\u00f3w-based Ruling Commission as Government Superintendent. Both institutions had the task of taking power from the hands of Austrian offices and administration. After J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski returned to Poland and took over the power delegated by the Regency Council, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski, as one of the few leaders of the ND camp remaining in the country, took part in talks with Pi\u0142sudski. He demanded that the Provisional Head of State immediately remove the red banner from the tower of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, and that a national government be set up soon, with representatives of all the major political parties. After the appointment of the cabinet of Ignacy Jan Paderewski's cabinet, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski in January 1919 (at the express request of General Lucjan \u017beligowski) was sent to an outpost in Bucharest. He obtained permission from the Romanian government and the French delegate to assemble Polish troops in Istanbul, Odessa and Bessarabia, and march them through Romania to Poland. They were to take part in fighting the Ukrainians in Galicia. He completed the mission successfully on 10 February 1919. He did not participate in the campaign of the National Electoral Committee of Democratic Parties for the Legislative Sejm (26 January 1919). However, he was elected as an MP, and took the oath only on his return to the country on 20 February 1919, and then became a member of the authorities of the new parliamentary club - the People's National Parliamentary Union . G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski joined in the process of building the organisational structures of ZLN. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski was a member of the Supreme Council, and he also remained chairman of the ZLN parliamentary club. The actual leadership of National Democracy policy in Poland remained in the hands of Stanis\u0142\u0105w Grabski. After Dmowski's return to Poland in February 1920, this division of political roles and responsibilities was maintained. Apart from his involvement in parliamentary work, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski was also active at that time in Galicia and the Borderlands. He co-founded, among other things: The Union of National Organisations of Eastern Lesser Poland, the Society for the Protection of the Borderlands and the League for the Defence of the Vilnius Land and the Republic as a whole. In the Sejm, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski . sat on the Treasury and Budget Committee (as its chairman) and the Constitutional Committee. On 30 May 1919, on behalf of the ZLN, he submitted a draft constitution to the Constitutional Committee, of which he was the author. It was criticised not only by the opposition, mainly socialists, who did not agree with the provisions concerning the Roman Catholic Church, the restriction of the rights of national minorities, and bicameralism. He drafted the section of the Constitution on Citizens' Rights and Duties in the Sejm, and was also the draftsman of the Citizenship Act. He proposed a number of laws in the areas of treasury, economy, and the labour question. He was one of the co-authors of the Act on the exchange and stamping of crowns, and he initiated the activities of the State Railway Council. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski also participated in the struggle for the territorial shape of the state. Taking into account the historical and ethnographic arguments, he saw the Polish state as consisting of Eastern Borderlands with Vilnius and Grodno, Galicia, Greater Poland, Upper Silesia (with access to mines), Cieszyn Silesia, Spisz, Orava, Pomerania with Gda\u0144sk, Warmia and Masuria. He also wrote in the press about the historical links between West Pomerania and the Republic of Poland. However, he saw the incorporation of this area into the Polish state as a longer historical process, taking into account possible future changes in European politics. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski strove for such a shape of borders in the parliamentary forum, in dozens of journalistic texts, but also by supporting various local initiatives (mainly in the Borderlands and Galicia). In May 1921, together with Stanis\u0142aw Zieli\u0144ski, he travelled to the United States. There, he strove with the Polish community, opinion-forming circles (mainly journalists), and \"governmental factors\" for broad support for the Polish territorial programme."

        "content": "Between 1919 and 1926, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski participated in the work to build the so-called Polish Majority Government. Initially, this seemed extremely difficult, not least because there were secessions within ZLN. In July 1920, he joined the Council for State Defence (he attended only three sittings, between 15 and 22 July 1920). After the collapse of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski's government, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski was mentioned as a possible candidate for Minister of Foreign Affairs. However, he did not take up the portfolio. After the resignation of Wincenty Witos's government, Tr\u0105mpczy\u0144ski, Speaker of the Sejm, offered G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski a mission to form a government. In a letter to the Speaker, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski outlined the plans for the new government. He promised, among other things, to organise new elections to parliament (within 4 months), to carry out currency reform (the introduction of the Polish zloty), to increase the income of state enterprises (mainly on the railways), to tighten up tax policy, etc. He also presented his programme in the Sejm, during the Convention of Seniors. However, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski's candidature was not accepted. The only clubs to vote for him were the ZLN, the National Christian Party and Christian Democracy. Between 1921 and 1922, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski strove to establish the so-called Polish Majority Government. He also actively participated in the parliamentary and presidential election campaign (1922). His name was mentioned in the corridors as a presidential candidate. In the parliamentary elections, he ran for the Sejm from two electoral lists, traditionally from the Lw\u00f3w list and the \"capital\" list - Warsaw list. The ChZJN leadership believed that his name, experience and popularity could strengthen the list in the capital. As a result, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski obtained a \"double\" mandate. He soon relinquished the latter in favour of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Rabski. After the assassination of the first President of the Second Republic Gabriel Narutowicz, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski took part in talks with the PSL \"Piast\" on the formation of a coalition government. After the government was formed, with Witos as Prime Minister, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski received the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Education. During his time as Minister, he carried out a number of major reforms, including the introduction of concessions for children on railway travels, the introduction of a uniform system of assessment, a uniform curriculum for the State Higher Teacher Training Course, the introduction of regulations defining the competences of pedagogical councils, regulations on the application of penalties against teachers by school district superintendents, the expansion of vocational and technical education (e.g. railway schools in Sosnowiec). He expanded vocational and technical education (e.g. railway schools in Sosnowiec and Radom, agricultural schools in \u017byrowice, the Faculty of Crafts and Industry was established in the State Industrial School in Bydgoszcz). In education for national minorities, he conducted a radical Polonization course. He changed Ukrainian grammar schools into Utraquist ones (with Polish inscriptions on the buildings), limited the number of hours of the Ukrainian language, but also initiated the creation of a Ukrainian university in Warsaw. Polonisation was also to be extended to Eastern Orthodox seminaries (with Polish as the language of instruction). Moreover, he strove to introduce the Polish language to rites and liturgy in the Orthodox Church, and put forward a postulate of autocephaly, which was supposed to make the Orthodox Church independent from the Moscow Patriarchate. In education, especially at universities, he did not abolish the discriminatory numerus clausus principle (restrictions on admitting Jewish students), transferring the right to decide on these matters to individual faculty councils of universities. In the case of German education, he announced the liquidation of schools (mainly rural), where the number of students did not exceed 30, and he also liquidated a few secondary schools for young people of German origin (e.g. in Toru\u0144). On 14 November 1923, in protest against the government's economic and fiscal policy, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski tendered his resignation. After the collapse of the Witos government on 14 December 1923, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski was again considered a candidate for Prime Minister. In October 1924, during the 4th All-Polish Congress, he proposed a reform of the constitution and electoral law. He demanded that the powers of the President be increased, the age limit for parliamentary elections be raised, and voting rights for national minorities \"disloyal to the Polish state\" be restricted. He also put forward similar proposals in a series of articles published in the Lw\u00f3w-based S\u0142owo Polskie [Polish Word]. He was also questioned by the Sejm's Commission of Inquiry into Secret Organisations, in connection with the charge of collaborating with the radical Pogotowie Patriot\u00f3w Polskich [Polish Patriots\u2019 Rescue]. In May 1926, he took part in the talks on appointing the third Wincenty Witos cabinet. After the May Coup of 1926, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski's position in the national camp visibly weakened. Like W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski, he was accused of incompetent policies and wrong decisions. In June 1926, during a meeting of the ZLN Supreme Council in Pozna\u0144, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski remained on the Board, but only as President of the ZLN Sejm Circle. In spite of this, his candidacy appeared again in the presidential elections (1926). G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski concentrated on his parliamentary work. He repeatedly spoke at the Sejm, especially on budgetary, fiscal and economic issues. He also drafted a revision of the Constitution and electoral laws (based on a draft by the ZLN of March 1926). The changes he postulated were intended to build a national state, and to limit the political role of national minorities. As the author of the chapter of the March Constitution entitled On the Rights of Citizens, he now advocated their restriction (mainly with regard to national minorities). In the election campaign of 1927-1928, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski participated in talks on the formation of a broader coalition with: ChD, NPR, PSL \"Piast\", SChN. Ultimately, this agreement was not reached.  G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski ran for the Senate and won a seat. Roman Rybarski was elected chairman of the ZLN parliamentary club, and the Senate club was headed by G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski. He was also put forward as a candidate for Speaker of the Senate, but received only 8 votes. In his parliamentary work, he spoke out on budgetary and fiscal matters, and participated in the work of the Treasury and Budget Committee. He criticised the government and Sanation economists for their statist policy, state interventionism, and lack of a broad and long-term plan for the country's economic development. G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski also maintained close contact with the Lw\u00f3w nationalist milieu. He was a patron of the local Young People's Party Youth Movement, headed by Zdzis\u0142aw Stahl. He also took part in the organisational work of the SN. He was a member of the National Party Organisational Committee (29 June 1928); the Programme Council; took an active part in setting up the SN Organisational Committee in Lw\u00f3w (September 1928); was a delegate to the SN Main Board meeting in Warsaw (October 1928), and was elected to the Political Committee there. He also co-initiated the formation of the National Defence League (a military arm of the SN). In the so-called Brze\u015b\u0107 elections of 1930 G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski ran for Senate and won a seat again (he became Chairman of the SN Senate Club). In his parliamentary work, he traditionally dealt with economic and budgetary issues. He was critical of the April Constitution (e.g. his speech in the Senate on 4 July 1935). After S\u0142owo Polskiewas taken over by the \"Team of One Hundred\", which cooperated with Sanation, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski launched a new magazine Lwowski Dziennik Narodowy (\"The National Daily in Lw\u00f3w\"), which disappeared from the press market after less than two years. Later, he also supported the establishment of the S\u0142owo Narodowe [National Word ](1937 -1939). Between 1937 and 1939 G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski was mainly active in politics in Lw\u00f3w, but he also periodically and systematically published texts in the national press: local (e.g. in \"Lwowski Dziennik Narodowy\" and \"S\u0142owo Polskie\") and nationwide (e.g. in \"Warszawski Dziennik Narodowy\" [Warsaw National Daily], \"My\u015bli Narodowej\" [National Idea] and \"Kurier Pozna\u0144ski\" [Pozna\u0144 Courier]). He also did some academic work, publishing successive texts on national economics, fiscal issues and budgetary policy. He also wrote legal (systemic) expert opinions, in which he evaluated the Polish constitutional system. In 1939, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski published his political memoirs in Pelplin and started to work on the history of Polish economics. In May 1939, he participated in the campaign for the municipal elections in Lw\u00f3w. He co-founded the Electoral Committee of the National-Catholic Camp which ran under the slogan: \"Lw\u00f3w was, is and will be Polish\". He did not get involved in the internal disputes within the SN between the opposing factions: J\u0119drzej Giertych and Kazimierz Kowalski with Tadeusz Bielecki's group."

On 11 September 1939, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski was about to leave Lw\u00f3w in the direction of the Romanian border, but he had a car accident and was forced to return to Lw\u00f3w again. On 17 September 1939, G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski was arrested by Soviet agents and locked up in the NKVD headquarters in Lw\u00f3w. A few days later, he was taken to the Brygidki prison.

He graduated from the University of Edinburgh on 1 August 1590, and was ordained a Presbyterian minister on 19 July 1593. In 1608 he was appointed minister of Falkirk, a position he held until 1615. He was promoted to the bishopric of Dunblane, receiving a Crown provision on 24 September 1615 and was consecrated by April of the following year. Balfour Paul states that he was also appointed, c. 1633, Dean of the Chapel Royal at Stirling Castle, and also held, as a personal right, Kilconquhar, succeeding to it upon the death of his nephew James, which was ratified in parliament in 1629. However, it is evident that Bellenden was appointed Dean of the Chapel Royal much earlier than Balfour Paul stated, as in 1621 the Privy Council of Scotland ordered that the widow of the previous Dean, William Couper, Bishop of Galloway, hand over documents relating to the Chapel Royal to Bellenden, and specifically called Bellenden 'deane of his Majesteis Chaippell'. Bellenden was very active in secular affairs.  He was appointed to Charles I's privy council in March 1626 and attended far more sessions than any other Scottish bishop. After holding the Dunblane bishopric for several decades, on 2 August 1635, he was given the more prestigious bishopric of Aberdeen. On 13 December 1638, after the anti-Episcopacy Assembly in Glasgow, described by Spottiswoode as \"the wild Assembly\", he was deprived of this position and, with many others, excommunicated by the Scottish church. He retired to England, where, in 1642, he was appointed to a parish in county Somerset.  (The Parish of St Dubricius, Porlock, 1642 to 1647)"

        "content": "Johnson spent much of his childhood in Baltimore.  He played his sophomore and junior season of high school basketball at Moorhead Senior High School in Moorhead, Minnesota. Johnson transferred from Minnesota to Towson Catholic High School prior to his senior season.  During the early signing period from November 13 through November 20, 1991, Johnson, who was considering several Ivy League schools as well as Northeastern University, verbally committed to Boston University. On December 1, 1991, Boston University announced that Johnson signed a letter of intent. During his senior season, Johnson lead Towson to the Baltimore Catholic Basketball League Championship.  Following the season, he earned Baltimore Catholic Basketball League All-league first-team recognition. He was also selected to participate in the Rodney Beasley East vs. West All-Star Games, sponsored by the Baltimore Metro Coaches Association. He was also a second team All-metro selection and following his 1992 graduation attended the Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia for a postgraduate year. In April 1993, after playing a year a Fork Union, Johnson signed a letter of intent with Herb Sendek's Miami (OH) team, but upon being accepted by Princeton University in June of that year, he revoked his letter. Johnson showed strong leadership skills early at Princeton and is the only three-time captain in university history. During his freshman year, he was twice named Ivy League Men's Basketball Rookie of the Week for the 1993\u201394 team.  That season the 11\u20133 Tigers could not match the  who were led by Jerome Allen and Matt Maloney. Johnson provided heroics for the 1994\u201395 Tigers on a couple of occasions.  On December 27, 1994, he hit what The New York Times described as \"a falling-down 3-point basket with three seconds left in regulation\".  The basket forced overtime.  At the end of the third overtime period Johnson converted two foul shots with three seconds left to cement a 71\u201366 victory over . Later that season, he set a career-high with a 25-point performance against  in a double-overtime victory.   He recorded seven steals in a game against  on February 3, 1995, which is one shy of the school record.  Again the Tigers could not get past . As a junior, he was named Ivy League Player of the week for the second weekend in February as he led the team on both ends of the court. The following week, he posted 21 points against , which established his season-high.  Even after Allen and Maloney graduated, Princeton's only two losses were to .  After Princeton and Penn ended the 1995\u201396 season tied as Ivy League Co-Champions, Johnson made the decisive three point shot with one minute and four seconds remaining in overtime in the one-game playoff, corralled a defensive rebound, added a pair of free throws with 24 seconds left and then made a steal.  The win ended an eight-game losing streak to Penn. The win earned the team the conference automatic bid to the 1996 NCAA Tournament and following the game head coach Pete Carril announced his retirement.  The thirteen seeded team was matched against the defending national champion UCLA Bruins in its first round pairing.  He was the team's leading scorer with 11 points in the 43\u201341 first round victory over UCLA in the 1996 NCAA Tournament.  The team fell behind 41\u201334 with over six minutes remaining. His 3-of-7 three point shooting performance included a shot to bring the team to within 4.  He also made the game-tying layup to knot the score at 41. He also defended Toby Bailey's last second shot after Princeton took the lead with 3.9 seconds remaining. During the game, UCLA jumped out to a 7\u20130 lead at the first TV timeout, and Johnson's leadership held the team together early when UCLA looked strong. As a senior, his new head coach, Bill Carmody described him as a shutdown defender. He was 1997 Ivy League Men's basketball Player of the Year. Johnson earned the award for his defense and was the first winner with a single-digit scoring average. He scored 15 on February 22, when Princeton clinched the Ivy League regular season championship by defeating .  The following week, he established Ivy League records for most consecutive three-point field goals made, with 11, and the most single-game three-point field goals made with no misses (6 for 6) against Columbia Lions men's basketball on February 28, 1997, and Cornell Big Red men's basketball (first 5) on March 1, 1997. He had twelve points in the regular season finale during which Princeton tied the school record with its nineteenth consecutive win. In the 1997 NCAA Tournament opening round matchup against the Cal Bears, when a final second pass was intercepted, he attempted to shoulder the blame with the press. He retired as the Princeton University all-time leader in steals.  His 169 total steals were fifth in Ivy League history at the end of his career and was eleventh at the end of the 2009-10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.  He retired second in Princeton history in career three point shots and fourth in career assists. After writing his senior thesis on Kenyan education under British colonial rule and graduating with a bachelor's degree in history, Johnson declined the postgraduate scholarship that he was awarded and played five years in Italy followed by two in Spain. Johnson played professional basketball in the Lega Basket Serie A and Legadue Basket in Italy and Liga Espa\u00f1ola de Baloncesto in Spain, one season each for Gorizia Pallacanestro A2, Viola Reggio Calabria, Adecco Milano/Ducato Siena, Casademont Girona and Montepaschi Siena. He played two seasons with the Avellino in Italy from 2000 to 2002. He had a seven-year professional career before becoming a coach. In 1998, he won an Italian Second Division championship as a starter for Gorizia Pallacanestro. In 1999, he earned another league championship with for Reggio Calabria, and in his final professional season in 2004 he earned a league title with Siena. With Reggio Calabria, he teamed with Brent Scott, Brian Oliver, and Manu Gin\u00f3bili to win a championship."

        "content": "When Scott abandoned his struggling Princeton team to coach at Denver in 2007, athletic director Gary Walters hired Sydney Johnson to take over the program. Johnson emerged from a field of Princeton offense veterans that included Mike Brennan, Robert Burke, Craig Robinson, Bill Carmody, Armond Hill, Chris Mooney, and Mitch Henderson. Johnson's demeanor as a coach is said by players to be more benevolent than his predecessor, Joe Scott, who left for the University of Denver after compiling a losing record in three years at Princeton. He was regarded as an inexperienced coach because he only had three years of experience as an assistant coach.  He became the youngest coach in the Ivy League. Johnson inherited a team that had gone 2\u201312 in conference the prior season and 38\u201345 overall during the prior three season. Among the lowlights that the team had achieved during the Scott era was a 21-point performance that tied the record for fewest points since the inception of the three point shot and the shot clock.  The team had ranked last in the nation in scoring in both 2006 and 2007. Although race is an issue among collegiate coaching ranks, in Johnson's first year, he was one of six African-American men's basketball head coaches in the 8-team Ivy League.

Writing in Slate, Felix Salmon called Cohan's articles \"bullshit\", arguing that he had no evidence that the trades in question were unusual, or that they had yielded the alleged profits, or that insider knowledge had been involved at all. Further, Terry Duffy, the CEO of CME Group Inc, the company that operates the exchange where the futures trade, questioned Cohan's understanding of the data, \"[Cohan] mistakenly summed up all volume for those derivatives during spans of time and implausibly attributed that buying and selling, spread across thousands of transactions, to a single bad actor or group of cheaters.\"  Cohan's piece, however, is explicit that the trades may have been carried out by many individuals and that \"There is no way ... to know who is making these trades.

Thoby Stephen was the eldest son of Leslie Stephen and Julia Prinsep Stephen. The result of his mother's second marriage, he was therefore a half-brother of George and Gerald Duckworth, her sons with first husband Herbert Duckworth. Stephen was educated at Clifton College, after failing to gain a place at Eton. However, this did not hold him back, since he won an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge, from Clifton. He was a friend of Lytton Strachey, who was enchanted by his masculinity and introduced him to the \"Reading Club\". He was described as \"over six feet tall and of somewhat ponderous build\". Stephen is credited with starting the Bloomsbury Group's Thursday evening gatherings. He was expected to distinguish himself, but he contracted typhoid at the age of 26 while on holiday in Greece, and died shortly after he was brought back to England. Vanessa Bell's eldest son, the poet Julian Bell, was named after him. He is the basis for the character of Tibby Schlegel in E.M. Forster's 1910 novel Howards End. Virginia Woolf's 1931 novel The Waves is considered by some critics to make significant reference to Thoby Stephen."

The barony had passed through his ancestors, the Earls of Derby and later the Dukes of Atholl, who up until 1765 had ruled the Isle of Man, originally as Kings of Man and later Lords of Man. He saw himself as a representative of this independent Island, which had no voice at Westminster, and as a courtesy to Manx politics, he sat as a cross-bencher in the House of Lords. In the Isle of Man, he bought property, farms and river banks with a view to running a fishing lodge based at Tholt-y-Will in Sulby Glen, a remote but enchanting location. He created the first fish hatchery on the Island. However, local fishing regulations made his piscatorial plans impossible, and Tholt-y-Will became a country inn.

He later became an administrator, acting as associate superintendent of schools in Edmonton and the superintendent of schools in Fort McMurray. Flaherty first ran for office in the 2004 Alberta provincial election, when he ran for the Alberta Liberal Party in St. Albert against incumbent Progressive Conservative Mary O'Neill.  Flaherty won an upset victory of just over four hundred votes. Once in office, Flaherty became the Liberal education critic, in which capacity he has argued that provincially mandated achievement tests should no longer be given to grade three students, and that the government should put increased focus on diagnostic testing of children at that age.  He has also advocated for a broader range of programs for high school students and better support for vocational programs.  In March 2007, he sponsored the School (Restrictions on Fees and Fundraising) Amendment Act (Bill 208), which would prohibit schools from charging fees or conducting fund-raising for the support of curricular activities.  The bill was defeated in May 2007. In September 2006, Flaherty announced that he would seek re-election during the next provincial election.  However, he was defeated by the Progressive Conservative candidate, former city councillor Ken Allred."

In the winter of 1841, he was married to Prudence H. Blish, of Wethersfield, Illinois, whose death in 1846 so depressed him that he undertook a variety of additional employments as a relief.  He became the proprietor and occasional editor of the village newspaper, engaged extensively in farming, and established a very thriving business in the manufacture of agricultural implements. In 1846 he was an unsuccessful candidate for US Congress. He served as delegate to the State constitutional convention in 1847.

        "content": "Born in Hamden, New Haven County, Connecticut (with ancestors who had emigrated from England in the 17th century), as an infant Chester Hubbard moved with his father Dana Hubbard and mother Aseneth to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1815. The growing family moved again four years later, to Wheeling (in what became West Virginia with this Hubbard's help during the American Civil War), where Dana Hubbard established the first lumber and grist mills in the new settlement on the National Road. The family also had three more sons who survived childhood, and a daughter, although Chester outlived all his siblings. Sent back east for higher education, Chester Hubbard graduated first in his class from the Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut in 1840. While at Wesleyan, Hubbard helped found the Eclectic Society, in 1838, making it one of older fraternal college organizations in the United States. (An ancestor, Rev. William Hubbard, had officiated as president of Harvard College at its 1688 commencement exercises). On September 20, 1842, Chester Hubbard married English-born Sarah Pallister, step-daughter of the late John List. They had five children: William Pallister Hubbard (who became a lawyer and congressman like his father), Dana List Hubbard (1845 - 1893), Chester Russell Hubbard (1848 - 1934), Julia Alice Hubbard Tyler (1850 - 1908) of Triadelphia, and  Anna Hubbard Brady (1852 - 1933, wife of Joseph C. Brady. An active member of Wheeling's Chapline Street Methodist Church, in 1872 Hubbard served as a delegate to the General Convention, held that year in Brooklyn, New York."

        "content": "Returning to Ohio County after graduating from college, he worked in his father's lumber business until his father died in 1852. Chester Hubbard, D. C. List and others then established the Bank of Wheeling, with Hubbard as its President until 1865, when it was reorganized as the German Bank, and he continued as President at the time of his death. In 1859 Hubbard organized C. D. Hubbard & Co., which leased the Crescent Iron Mill, which manufactured railroad iron for over a year. He also helped organize the Wheeling Hinge Company, of which he served as a director until his death. In 1871 he became secretary of the reorganized Wheeling Iron and Nail Company. He was also a member of Logan & Co. for twenty years and president of the Logan Drug Company at the time of his death. After the adoption of the Virginia Constitution of 1850 led to increased representation of western Virginia in the Virginia General Assembly, Ohio County, which had previously been represented in the Virginia House of Delegates by Charles W. Russell, received two additional seats. Hubbard was elected to fill one of them in 1851, but neither he, John M. Oldham nor Russell was re-elected in 1853. Instead, Ohio County lost one seat, and John C. Campbell and Thomas M. Gally were elected to the remaining seats. Ohio County voters elected Hubbard one of their three delegates to the Virginia convention in Richmond, Virginia in 1861 and opposed secession. He then was elected one of Ohio County's six delegates at the Wheeling Convention of 1861 served as delegate to the West Virginia constitutional convention in Wheeling the same year. Hubbard then served in the West Virginia senate in 1863 and 1864, and his eldest son William Pallister Hubbard, who had become a lawyer, served as an officer of the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry. Hubbard was an active Republican and partisan of James G. Blaine and served as delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1864 and 1880. Hubbard was elected as an Unconditional Unionist to the 39th United States Congress and reelected as a Republican to the 40th United States Congress (March 4, 1865 \u2013 March 3, 1869). He served as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Interior (Fortieth Congress), but was defeated in the primary in 1868, and so resumed his banking and manufacturing pursuits. He was among the promoters and builders of the Pittsburg, Wheeling & Kentucky Railroad in 1873, becoming president of the road in 1874. An earnest friend of education, Hubbard was a trustee of the Linsly Institute (which his son attended) in 1848, and became its treasurer in 1873. He also helped found the Wheeling Female College, and served as a trustee, and as President of the Board from 1865 up to the sale of the property."

He appeared in 92 games for the 1904 Tigers, but his batting average fell by 67 points to .214. Interviewed in November 1905, Carr attributed his decline at the plate to the incident in which his nose was broken in Nashville: \"There is no doubt that that bump I got in the nose down south two years ago had something to do with my falling off with the stick.

In the summer of 1707, he was an assistant physician in field hospitals at Brussels and Ghent during the War of the Spanish Succession. He then traveled to Leiden, where he studied anatomy under Bernhard Siegfried Albinus (1653\u20131721) and Govert Bidloo (1649\u20131713), also attending Hermann Boerhaave\u2019s lectures on chemistry and ocular diseases. In 1708 he earned his doctorate from the University of Harderwijk, and in the summer of 1709, rejoined the Dutch military as a field surgeon during the Siege of Tournai. Shortly afterwards, he distinguished himself in treatment of the wounded from the Battle of Malplaquet. In 1711 he was appointed professor of anatomy and surgery at the University of Altdorf, and from 1720, was a professor of anatomy and surgery at Helmstedt, where he remained for rest of his life. During his tenure at Helmstedt, he also taught classes in botany and practical medicine. In 1730 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Among his numerous writings, his best-known work is Chirurgie, a book on surgery that was translated into several languages. It was used extensively in Japan, and was still employed as a standard text at Vienna as late as 1838. Heister's botanical garden in Helmstedt was considered one of the most beautiful in Germany. In 1718, he coined the word \"tracheotomy\". Also, he is credited for being the first physician to perform a post-mortem section of appendicitis. His name is lent to the plant genus Heisteria, as well as to the spiral valves of Heister, defined as anatomical folds of the cystic duct. He died in Bornum am Elm. His botanical writings were published as Beschreibung eines neuen Geschlechts in 1755, with illustrated descriptions of plants."

        "content": "George William Hunter (born November 5, 1942) is an American former executive director of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), the players' union of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is also a former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins. Hunter played baseball as a child, and helped lead his team to the Little League World Series in 1955. He graduated from Delaware Township High School in Delaware Township (now Cherry Hill), New Jersey, and played college football for the Syracuse Orange.  While a student-athlete at Syracuse University, \"he helped organize the school's boycott of Southern schools whose stadiums were segregated.\" Following his football career, Hunter attended law school at UC Berkeley School of Law and became an attorney.  One of the youngest United States Attorneys in history, he was appointed to serve the Northern District of California, where he prosecuted high-profile federal defendants including members of Hells Angels and the Black Panther Party. Hunter was named the executive director of the NBPA in 1996. Hunter was criticized for employing many family members within the NBPA.  An external audit initiated by Derek Fisher uncovered numerous irregularities, and a select committee of NBA players unanimously ousted Hunter from his position on February 16, 2013, during the NBA All-Star break. In May 2013, Hunter sued the NBPA, Fisher and Jamie Wior\u2014Fisher's publicist and business partner\u2014seeking compensation and punitive damages. The suit claimed that Fisher had a secret deal with NBA owners during the 2011 NBA lockout. In January 2014, a judge dismissed all of Hunter's claims against Wior and Fisher, and Hunter dropped his subsequent appeal in May. However, the judge also ruled that it was the union's prerogative to fire Hunter, but allowed Hunter's claim that he was still owed $10.5 million to continue."

        "content": "Writing in The Washington Post, critic Michael Dirda called Kelleghan \"an expert on humor in genre fiction,\" and she was listed on the University of Miami's website as its official expert on \"Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror.\" She is also interested in film both inside and outside the science-fiction genre, and is an amateur ethologist. She has identified a secular, satiric literary movement within the science-fiction genre that she calls \"Savage Humanism.\" Her critical anthology The Savage Humanists (Robert J. Sawyer Books, 2008) begins with a 17,000-word essay by her describing the movement and its practitioners, and collects stories by Gregory Frost, James Patrick Kelly, John Kessel, Jonathan Lethem, James Morrow, Kim Stanley Robinson, Robert J. Sawyer, Tim Sullivan, and Connie Willis, with introductions to each by Kelleghan. That essay, \"A Definition of Savage Humanism, with Autobiographical Anecdotes,\" is reprinted as the cover story in the November 2008 edition of The New York Review of Science Fiction, and takes up most of that issue of the magazine. Kelleghan's other books include Mike Resnick: An Annotated Bibliography and Guide to His Work (Farthest Star, 2000), and, as editor, 100 Masters of Mystery and Detective Fiction (Salem Press, 2001, 2 volumes) and Magill's Choice: Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature (Salem Press, 2002). Her scholarly work has appeared in Extrapolation, Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts, The New York Review of Science Fiction, Nova Express, ParaDoxa: Studies in World Literary Genres, Science Fiction Studies, and SFRA Review (a publication of the Science Fiction Research Association, of which she is a member). She has contributed to the reference books American Women Writers; Contemporary Novelists [7th Edition] (for which she is the authority on Ray Bradbury, Jonathan Lethem, and Connie Willis, among others); Magill's Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature; Fantasy and Horror: A Critical and Historical Guide to Literature, Illustration, Film, TV, Radio, and the Internet, edited by Neil Barron; St. James Guide to Crime & Mystery Writers; St. James Guide to Science Fiction Writers; Supernatural Fiction Writers: Contemporary Fantasy and Horror; and Twentieth-Century Literary Movements Dictionary; and, with Daryl F. Mallett, to Genre and Ethnic Collections: Collected Essays, and she was largely responsible for assisting Mallett and Hal Hall with the completion of Pilgrims & Pioneers: The History and Speeches of the Science Fiction Research Association Award Winners (Borgo Press, 1999). Fiona's book reviews have appeared in The Washington Post and as official commissioned reviews for BarnesandNoble.com, and she has contributed numerous plot summaries and mini-biographies to the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Kelleghan was a book-review editor for the Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts (since 1999) and an editorial consultant to Science Fiction Studies (since 1994). She was on the advisory board for and a contributor to The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders (edited by Gary Westfahl, Greenwood Press, 2005), and has been a judge for the William L. Crawford Fantasy Award, given by the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts to emerging writers. In March 2008, Kelleghan presented a paper entitled \"The Intimately Human and the Grandly Cosmic: Humor and the Sublime in the Works of Robert J. Sawyer\" at the 29th International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts. In March 2009, she presented a paper entitled \"Time and the Fiction of Robert J. Sawyer: Flash Forward to the End of an Era\" at the 30th International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts. In the 1990s, she had given talks at the same venue on the feeding of cats in science fiction and fantasy and on camouflage in books and films such as Toys and Predator. Her works in progress include Alfred Bester, Grand Master: An Annotated Bibliography  and further research on Savage Humanism. Kelleghan was an Associate Professor at the University of Miami. She was on the faculty there from 1989 to 2011, and tenured since 1995. She holds an M.S. in Library and Information Science from Florida State University (1988) and an M.A. in English from the University of Miami (1996). She is a graduate of the Clarion West science-fiction writing workshop (1995). Her short story \"The Secret in the Chest: With Tests, Maps, Mysteries, & Intermittent Discussion Questions,\" which plays with the conventions of damsel-in-distress fairy tales, appeared in Realms of Fantasy (October 1998), and earned an Honorable Mention from editor Gardner Dozois in The Year's Best Science Fiction: 16th Annual Collection (1999)."

By contrast Phillips felt his wife, who Sinclair often appeared opposite, was a dramatic actress of tremendous power with a magnificent voice. Sinclair appeared both on Broadway and in the West End. His screen work began in British films. His most notable role possibly is Leslie Charteris's The Saint in The Saint's Vacation followed by The Saint Meets the Tiger.

Bernardo was a prominent lawyer from Marinduque who served one term in the Philippine Assembly representing the province of Tayabas. Three of her eight siblings died in infancy, while an older sister died from appendicitis at age 11. The death of her younger sister Elisa, who had made known her desire to become a doctor for the poor, inspired del Mundo to choose a career in medicine. In 1926, del Mundo enrolled at the UP College of Medicine, at the original campus of the University of the Philippines in Manila. She earned her medical degree in 1933, graduating as class valedictorian. She passed the medical board exam that same year, placing third among the examinees. Her exposure while in medical school to various health conditions afflicting children in the provinces, particularly in Marinduque, led her to choose pediatrics as her specialization."

However, according to an archivist at Harvard's Center for the History of Medicine, Harvard had had thousands of Asian students by the time Del Mundo arrived there. Del Mundo returned to Harvard Medical School's Children's Hospital in 1939 for a two-year research fellowship. She also enrolled at the Boston University School of Medicine, earning a Master's degree in bacteriology in 1940."

She joined the International Red Cross and volunteered to care for child-internees then detained at the University of Santo Tomas internment camp for foreign nationals. She set up a makeshift hospice within the internment camp, and her activities led her to be known as \"The Angel of Santo Tomas\". After the Japanese authorities shut down the hospice in 1943, del Mundo was asked by Manila mayor Le\u00f3n Guinto to head a children's hospital under the auspices of the city government. The hospital was later converted into a full-care medical center to cope with the mounting casualties during the Battle of Manila, and would be renamed the North General Hospital (later, the Jose R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center). Del Mundo would remain the hospital's director until 1948. Del Mundo joined the faculty of the University of Santo Tomas, then the Far Eastern University in 1954. She became the head of the Department of Pediatrics at Far Eastern University - Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation for more than two decades. During this time, she founded the Children's Medical Center Foundation in 1957. She also established a small medical pediatric clinic to pursue a private practice and established the Institute of Maternal and Child Health, an institution that trains doctors and nurses."

Towards that end, she sold her home and most of her personal effects, and obtained a sizable loan from the GSIS (the Government Service Insurance System) in order to finance the construction of her own hospital. The Children's Medical Center, a 107-bed hospital located in Quezon City, was inaugurated in 1957 as the first pediatric hospital in the Philippines. The hospital was expanded in 1966 through the establishment of an Institute of Maternal and Child Health, the first institution of its kind in Asia. In 1958, del Mundo conveyed her personal ownership of the hospital to a board of trustees. Dr. Fe del Mundo lived on the second floor of the Children's Medical Center in Quezon City and continued making early morning rounds until she was 99 years old."

Undeterred by the lack of well-equipped laboratories in post-war Philippines, she unhesitatingly sent specimens or blood samples for analysis abroad. In the 1950s, she pursued studies on dengue fever, a common malady in the Philippines, of which little was known at the time. Her clinical observations on dengue, and the findings of research she later undertook on the disease are said to \"have led to a fuller understanding of dengue fever as it afflicts the young\". She authored over a hundred articles, reviews, and reports in medical journals on such diseases as dengue, polio and measles. She also authored Textbook of Pediatrics, a fundamental medical text used in Philippine medical schools. Del Mundo was active in the field of public health, with special concerns towards rural communities. She organized rural extension teams to advise mothers on breastfeeding and child care. and promoted the idea of linking hospitals to the community through the public immersion of physicians and other medical personnel to allow for greater coordination among health workers and the public for common health programs such as immunization and nutrition. She called for the greater integration of midwives into the medical community, considering their more visible presence within rural communities. Notwithstanding her own devout Catholicism, she was an advocate of family planning and population control. Del Mundo was also known for having devised an incubator made out of bamboo, designed for use in rural communities without electrical power."

Though still an adolescent in 1905, he walked 600 kilometres to participate in the first World Congress of Esperanto in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, where he spoke with mature eloquence. At the 1907 International Socialist Congress, Privat advocated the use of Esperanto by the International Socialist Bureau in Brussels. Privat served as a committee member of the World Esperanto Association (in Esperanto \"UEA: Universala Esperanto-Asocio\") beginning in 1912. From 1920 until 1934, he was editor-in-chief of Esperanto's eponymous official magazine. From 1924 until 1938 he was president of the UEA and at the same time president of the International Central Committee. He resigned after a scandal. Privat advanced the international Esperanto organization inside and outside UEA. His works History of the Esperanto language (in two volumes) and The Life of Zamenhof made him one of the most important historians of Esperanto. As the first historian of Esperanto and Zamenhof's first biographer, he used his connections within Swiss academia to further Esperanto. He authored a linguistic study Esprimo de sentoj en Esperanto (Expression of feelings in Esperanto), is the author of the lyrical Ginevra and of the poem anthology Tra l'silento (Through the Silence). Also, he wrote books teaching Esperanto, Karlo and Course Reader. During the years 1923\u20131926, Privat was a vice-delegate of Iran at the  League of Nations.   He presented Esperanto at the League of Nations, at the International Labour Organization (ILO) and at the Universal Telegraph Union.  He was a brilliant organizer, and arranged many international conferences about Esperanto instruction in Geneva (1922). He became a Quaker in 1936. He was a very spiritual person with a wide open heart to the Unity of Religions, as we can see in one of his best books \"Sagesse de l'Orient au dela des Religions\", published around 1945, where we take us in a tour around the different religions and spiritual movements, ending with his appreciation of Gandhi."

        "content": "Wright contends that historians and intellectuals have failed to understand the difference between race and racism, which has in turn impaired their ability to understand who Black people are in America. He argues that Black Americans are to be distinguished from other categories of black people in the country: black Africans, West Indians, or Hispanics. While Black people are members of the black race, as are other groups of people, they are a distinct ethnic group of that race. This conceptual failure has hampered the ability of historians to define Black experience in America and to study it in the most accurate, authentic, and realistic manner possible. Wright lectures often about how white people have been affected by their own racism and how it impacts upon relations between blacks and whites and the United States. He asserts that since the late 17th century, most Whites have been afflicted by their own racism, as evidenced by considerable delusional thinking, dehumanization, and alienation from America. White people have created and maintained a White racist America, which is the antithesis of liberty, equality, justice, and freedom; Black people continue to be the primary victims of this culture."

While at MIT, Robert Langer, a professor at MIT, encouraged Edwards to develop an efficient way for inhalers to deliver medicine to the lungs. Edwards joined the Pennsylvania State University faculty as an Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering in 1995, where he continued to research ways to make medicine inhalable. In 1997,  Science published his study on a new type of inhalable aerosol that efficiently delivered drugs to the lungs. Edwards left academia in 1998 when he and Langer founded Advanced Inhalation Research (AIR); the startup was purchased a year later by Alkermes for $114 million. He returned to academia in 2002, joining the Harvard faculty. Edwards' scientific work in biomedical engineering concerns the research and development of drug delivery platforms for treating infectious diseases in the developing world. He was a founder of Advanced Inhalation Research, now part of Alkermes, Inc., of Pulmatrix, and of Medicine in Need, an international non-governmental organization aimed at developing new drugs and vaccines for diseases of poverty, such as tuberculosis. In 2020, Edwards founded the company Sensory Cloud. Sensory Cloud released a nasal inhalable product intended to reduce infected air droplets from viruses like SARS-CoV-2, a strain of coronavirus known to cause COVID-19. In a February 2021 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Edwards and his colleagues posited that \"exhaled aerosol increases with COVID-19 infection, age, and obesity.\""

He was a poor but curious student and did the majority of his schoolwork at night while he worked in a savings bank.  At the university he began studying philosophy and literature, which he abandoned in his third year.  He obtained a job as an administrator at Iberia, dedicating himself to reading and writing.  His first novel was influenced by Julio Cort\u00e1zar and consequently shows the influence of the then-prevalent literary experimentalism, as well as the uncertainty of a fledgling author.  Although very original, his second book, Cerbero son las sombras (1975), obtained the Premio S\u00e9samo and garnered a positive critical response. Thanks to an enthusiastic member of the judges panel for the Premio S\u00e9samo, Juan Garc\u00eda Hortelano, Mill\u00e1s was able to publish Visi\u00f3n del ahogado (1977) and El jard\u00edn vac\u00edo (The empty garden) (1981) with the prestigious publisher Alfaguara.  But his most popular novel was Papel mojado (1983), an assignment for a publisher of young adult literature that was a commercial success and continues to sell well.  Simultaneously, he began to publish articles in the Spanish press with great success, so he left the employment of the Iberian press and now makes a living as a journalist and author. In his numerous works\u2014which are mostly psychological and introspective\u2014any daily fact can become a fantastic event.  He created his own personal literary genre, the articuento, in which an everyday story is transformed into a fantasy that allows the reader to see reality more critically.  His weekly columns in El Pa\u00eds have generated a great number of followers who appreciate the subtlety and originality of his point of view in dealing with current events, as well as his commitment to social justice and the quality of his writing.  On the program La Ventana, on the channel Ser, he has a time slot (Fridays at 4:00) in which he encourages viewers to send short accounts about words from the dictionary.  Currently, he is constructing a glossary, within which these accounts have a large role.  His works have been translated into 23 languages, among them: English, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, and Dutch.  In his 2006 novel, titled Laura y Julio, we find his principal obsessions expressed: the problem of identity, symmetry, other inhabitable spaces within our space, love, fidelity, and jealousy. He married his second wife, Isabel Men\u00e9ndez, a psychologist, in 1987. With her, he had his second child."

In his 15 years at the helm of Hampshire, Prince worked to broaden the public's awareness of the value and role of liberal arts education, reinforcing the understanding that the liberal arts are about developing an attitude of mind, not simply conveying a body of knowledge. Prince built partnerships with organizations outside of education and with K-12 education, stressing the importance of strong relationships between higher education institutions and their surrounding communities and the responsibility of higher education to society as a whole. As president, he envisioned a \"Cultural Village,\" a cluster of independent organizations with complementary missions located around the campus.  The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, a center for international picture book art, drew 90,000 visitors to the Hampshire campus and Amherst during its first year. The National Yiddish Book Center, shares the treasures of rescued Yiddish Books, representing a thousand years of Jewish history and culture. Lastly, New England Wetlands, Inc., grows 118 species of plants for use in restoration of wetlands throughout the region. Prince has served as president of Five Colleges, Inc. and as chairman of the board of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts (AICUM). He is chairman of The Washington Campus, vice-chair of the Council on Racial and Ethnic Justice of the American Bar Association and serves on the board of directors of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), the Massachusetts Nature Conservancy and the Joyful Child Foundation. Prince is also the 2004 recipient of the Millicent Kauffman Award from the Amherst Area Chamber of Commerce, the town's equivalent of the citizen of the year. Prince is currently a member of the Board of Trustees of the American University in Bulgaria and a member of the Governing Board of the European Humanities University. In 2008 he authored a book, Teach Them to Challenge Authority, in which he argues that \"educational institutions should model the behaviour and values they seek to instil in their students and how this is essential to teaching students how to challenge authority and convention in appropriate, creative and constructive ways.\" Prince earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in American studies, a Masters in philosophy and a Ph.D. in American studies from Yale University. Before joining Hampshire, he was associate dean of the faculty for curriculum planning and resource development at Dartmouth College and a professor of history."

        "content": "John Sutherland (December 1808 \u2013 14 July 1891) was a physician and promoter of sanitary science. Sutherland was born in Edinburgh, where he completed his high school studies. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1827, and graduated M.D. at the university in 1831. He was married to Sarah Elizabeth Cowie (1808\u201395), daughter of a Lancashire merchant. There were no children. Mrs Sutherland became a friend of Florence Nightingale, and assisted her with practical matters, when he became Nightingale's closest collaborator. Mrs Sutherland shared their concerns about public health; she was an active member of the Ladies' Sanitary Association. After spending much time on the continent he practised for a short period in Liverpool, where he edited 'The Liverpool Health of Towns' Advocate' in 1846. In 1848, at the request of the Earl of Carlisle, he entered the public service as an inspector under the first board of health. He conducted several special inquiries, notably one into the cholera epidemic of 1848\u20139 (Parl. Papers, 1850 No. 1273, 1852 No. 1523). He was the head of a commission sent to foreign countries to inquire into the law and practice of burial. In 1851, Sutherland was appointed as the British medical delegate to the first International Sanitary Conference (aka Cholera Conference or Quarantine Conference). Louis Napoleon conferred him the Order of the Legion of Honour for services in producing a new International Sanitary Regulation. In 1855 he was engaged at the Home Office in bringing into operation the act for abolishing intramural interments (ib. 1856, No. 146). He was also doing duty in the reorganised general board of health when, at the request of Lord Palmerston and Lord Panmure, he became the head of the Sanitary Commission sent to the Crimean War to deal with the massive sanitary defects of the war hospitals. This commission's mandate was not only to investigate but to implement changes. It started work in March 1855 on the worst Scutari hospitals and succeeded in bringing down the death rates. With Sutherland was a leading civil engineer, Robert Rawlinson, and members of the pioneering Sanitary Department at Liverpool, who did the cleaning out of the sewers and drains. On 25 August 1855 he came to England for consultation, and was summoned to Balmoral to inform the Queen of the steps that had been taken for the benefit of the troops. After the war he and Nightingale, with many others, tried to get the planned Royal Victoria Hospital at Netley cancelled (it was drastically redesigned). He and Nightingale jointly produced a confidential report on it for the war secretary. He took an active part in the preparation of the report of the royal commission on the health of the army dated 1858 (ib. 1857\u201358, No. 2318), and also of the report on the state of the army in India, dated 19 May 1863 (ib. 1863, No. 3184). Both reports were of vast importance to the welfare of the soldiers, and most of Sutherland's recommendations were carried out. One of these was the appointment of the barrack and hospital improvement commission, with Sidney Herbert as president and Captain (afterwards Sir) Douglas Galton, Dr. Burrell of the army medical department, and Sutherland as members. This committee visited every barrack and hospital in the United Kingdom, and the sanitary arrangements of each were reported on. Defects were brought to light and remedied, and the health of the troops consequently improved (ib. 1861, No. 2839). Subsequently, Dr. Sutherland and Captain Galton visited and made reports on the Mediterranean stations, including the Ionian Islands (ib. 1863, No. 3207). As a member of the Royal Commission on the Crimean War, Sutherland worked up the considerable amount of evidence for it. He also gave his own evidence to it. He then became the \"active member\" of the four sub-commissions set up within the War Office, after the Crimean War, to ensure that the recommendations of the Royal Commission were implemented. Further, again according to Nightingale, not only was he a member of the Royal Commission on India, he \"wrote nearly the whole\" of the report on it. That work benefited as well as the British Army, \"the whole native population\u2014all that has been done for them sprang from this commission\". In 1862 the barrack and hospital improvement commission was reconstituted with the quartermaster-general as president and Sutherland as a prominent member. The title was altered to the army sanitary committee in 1865 (ib. 1865, No. 424). Two Indian officers were added, and all sanitary reports were submitted to the committee and suggestions for improving Indian stations prepared. This arrangement remained in force until Sutherland's retirement on 30 June 1888, when he was appointed a medical superintending inspector-general of the board of health and home office. Nightingale considered that Dr Sutherland received so little recognition for his work: no honours from the UK, although the French gave him the Legion of Honour. Nightingale and Sutherland formed an effective public health reform team. They shared a common philosophy, of the application of the best available science, to be applied to the problem at hand, then ongoing monitoring to ensure that the results were beneficial. Sutherland acted sometimes as Nightingale\u2019s research assistant, finding crucial material for her\u2014he was a doctor and well connected internationally with public health and military experts. Sometimes he was her secretary, reading correspondence and drafting replies for her. They shared a Christian faith and ambitious, faith-based, goals for reform. Sutherland drafted some of Nightingale\u2019s boldest statements about quality hospital care being available to the poorest\u2014as good as that received by private patients. Sutherland continued his beneficent work to within a few years of his death, which took place at Oakleigh, Alleyne Park, Norwood, Surrey, on 14 July 1891. Sutherland\u2019s last words to his wife were for Nightingale: \u201cGive her my love and my blessing\u201d. Nightingale insisted that a full obituary to her friend and collaborator appeared in The Times. Sutherland was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. Eight volumes of notes and correspondence between Sutherland and Nightingale are at the British Library."

        "title": "Karen Barad_Agential realism",
        "content": "According to Barad's theory of agential realism, the universe comprises phenomena, which are \"the ontological inseparability of intra-acting agencies\". Intra-action, a neologism introduced by Barad, signals an important challenge to individualist metaphysics. For Barad, phenomena   or objects do not precede their interaction, rather, 'objects' emerge through particular intra-actions. Thus, apparatuses, which produce phenomena, are not assemblages of humans and nonhumans (as in actor-network theory). Rather, they are the condition of possibility of 'humans' and 'non-humans', not merely as ideational concepts, but in their materiality. Apparatuses are 'material-discursive' in that they produce determinate meanings and material beings while simultaneously excluding the production of others. What it means to matter is therefore always material-discursive. Barad takes their inspiration from physicist Niels Bohr, one of the founders of quantum physics. Barad's agential realism is at once an epistemology (theory of knowing), an ontology (theory of being), and an ethics. For this, Barad introduces the neologism ontoepistemology. Because specific practices of mattering have ethical consequences, excluding other kinds of mattering, onto-epistemological practices are always in turn onto-ethico-epistemological. Much of Barad's scholarly work has revolved around their concept of \"agential realism,\" and their theories hold importance for many academic fields, including science studies, STS (Science, Technology, and Society), feminist technoscience, philosophy of science, feminist theory, and, of course, physics. In addition to Bohr, their work draws on the works of thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, and Walter Benjamin, among others. Barad's original training was in theoretical particle physics and quantum field theory.  Their book, Meeting the Universe Halfway, (2007), includes a chapter that contains an original discovery in theoretical physics, which is largely unheard of in books that are usually categorized as 'gender studies' or 'cultural theory' books. In this book, Barad also argues that 'agential realism,' is useful to the analysis of literature, social inequalities, and many other things. This claim is based on the fact that Barad's agential realism is a way of understanding the politics, ethics, and agencies of any act of observation, and indeed any kind of knowledge practice.  According to Barad, the deeply connected way that each \"thing\" is entangled with everything else in materially specific ways means that all intra-actions reconfigure the entanglements. Barad's innovative and far-reaching formulation of intra-action, which challenges the usual notion of interaction which assumes a metaphysics of individualism, offers a new formulation of causality. There are not things that interact but rather through and within intra-actions there is a differentiating-entangling so that an agential cut is enacted that cuts things together-apart (one move) such that differences exist not as absolute separations but in their inseparability (i.e., \"agential separability\" as Barad calls it). Nothing is inherently separate from anything else, but separations are enacted within phenomena. This view of knowledge provides a framework for thinking about how culture and habits of thought can make some things visible and other things easier to ignore or to never see.  For this reason, according to Barad, agential realism is useful for feminist analysis and other forms of political and social thought, even if the connection to science is not apparent. Barad's framework makes several other arguments, and some of them are part of larger trends in fields such as science studies and feminist technoscience (all can be found in her 2007 book, Meeting the Universe Halfway): They defines agency as a relationship and not as something that one \"has.\" The scientist and the social are always part of the apparatus, and one needs to take account of this in its inseparability in analyzing the system. This differs from the view that political critiques of science seek to undermine the credibility of science; instead, Barad argues that this kind of critique actually makes for better, more credible science. They argue that politics and ethical issues are always part of scientific work, and only are made to seem separate by specific historical circumstances that encourage people to fail to see those connections. One example they discuss is the ethics of developing nuclear weapons to argue this point, by claiming that the ethics and politics are part of how such weapons were developed and understood, and therefore part of science, and not merely of the \"philosophy of science\" or the \"ethics of science.\"  This differs from the usual view that one can strive for a politics-free, bias-less science. Nevertheless, they argue against epistemological relativism, and offers an important alternative to the usual conception of objectivity. They also reject the idea that science is \"only\" a language game or set of fictions produced only by human constructions and concepts. Although the scientist is part of the \"intra-action\" of the experiment, humans (and their cultural constructs) do not have complete control over everything that happens. Barad expresses this point by saying, in \"Getting Real,\" that although scientists shape knowledge about the universe, you can't ignore the way the universe \"kicks back.\" These points on science, agency, ethics, and knowledge reveal that Barad's work is similar to the projects of other science studies scholars such as Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway, Andrew Pickering, and Evelyn Fox Keller."

Examining issues such as the formation of utopian thought, the ideology of gender relations, and the potentials of human existence, Uebel has urged a reconnaissance of disciplines as seemingly disparate as psychoanalysis, gerontology, philosophy, and social science. Uebel is forging an approach to literary, philosophical, and social phenomena that eludes the narcissistic allegorization of history that mires much contemporary cultural studies work.  Increasingly, Uebel's writing focuses on the currents of cultural analysis in the humanities. As a psychotherapist, Uebel\u2019s practice and research focus on issues related to the social contexts of psychopathology and treatment modalities that address the person, the social body, and the relational world, including mindfulness modalities, gestalt therapy, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)."

        "content": "Francis Birch (August 22, 1903 \u2013 January 30, 1992) was an American geophysicist. He is considered one of the founders of solid Earth geophysics. He is also known for his part in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. During World War II, Birch participated in the Manhattan Project, working on the design and development of the gun-type nuclear weapon known as Little Boy. He oversaw its manufacture, and went to Tinian to supervise its assembly and loading into Enola Gay, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress tasked with dropping the bomb. A graduate of Harvard University, Birch began working on geophysics as a research assistant. He subsequently spent his entire career at Harvard working in the field, becoming an Associate Professor of Geology in 1943, a professor in 1946, and Sturgis Hooper Professor of Geology in 1949, and professor emeritus in 1974. Birch published over 100 papers. He developed what is now known as the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state in 1947. In 1952 he demonstrated that Earth's mantle is chiefly composed of silicate minerals, with an inner and outer core of molten iron. In two 1961  papers on compressional wave velocities, he established  what is now called Birch's law."

        "content": "Albert Francis Birch was born in Washington, D.C., on August 22, 1903, the son of George Albert Birch, who was involved in banking and real estate, and Mary Hemmick Birch, a church choir singer and soloist at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C. He had three younger brothers: David, who became a banker; John, who became a diplomat; and Robert, who became a songwriter. He was educated at Washington, D.C., schools, and Western High School, where he joined the High School Cadets in 1916. In 1920 Birch  entered Harvard University on a scholarship. While there he served in Harvard's Reserve Officers' Training Corps Field Artillery Battalion. He graduated magna cum laude in 1924, and received his Bachelor of Science (S.B.) degree in electrical engineering. Birch went to work in the Engineering Department of the New York Telephone Company. He applied for and received an American Field Service Fellowship in 1926, which he used to travel to Strasbourg, and study at the University of Strasbourg's Institut de Physique under the tutelage of Pierre Weiss. There, he wrote or co-wrote four papers, in French, on topics such as the paramagnetic properties of potassium cyanide, and the magnetic moment of Cu++ ions. On returning to the United States in 1928, Birch went back to Harvard to pursue physics. He was awarded his Master of Arts (A.M.) degree in 1929, and then commenced work on his 1932 Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree under the supervision of Percy Bridgman, who would receive the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1946. For his thesis, Birch measured the vapor-liquid critical point of mercury. He determined this as 1460\u00b120\u00a0\u00b0C and 1640\u00b150\u00a0kg/cm2, results he published in 1932 in the Physical Review. Around this time, there was an increased interest in geophysics at Harvard University, and Reginald Aldworth Daly established a Committee for Experimental Geology and Geophysics that included Bridgman, astronomer Harlow Shapley, geologists Louis Caryl Graton and D. H. McLaughlin and chemist G. P. Baxter. William Zisman, another one of Bridgman's Ph.D. students, was hired as the committee's research associate, but, having little interest in the study of rocks, he resigned in 1932. The position was then offered to Birch, who had little interest or experience in geology either, but with the advent of the Great Depression, jobs were hard to find, and he accepted. On July 15, 1933, Birch married Barbara Channing, a Bryn Mawr College alumna, and a collateral descendant of the theologian William Ellery Channing. They had three children: Anne Campaspe, Francis (Frank) Sylvanus and Mary Narcissa. Frank later became a professor of geophysics at the University of New Hampshire."

        "content": "In 1942, during World War II, Birch took a leave of absence from Harvard, in order to work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Radiation Laboratory, which was developing radar. He worked on the proximity fuze, a radar-triggered fuze that would explode a shell in the proximity of a target. The following year he accepted a commission in the United States Navy as a lieutenant commander, and was posted to the Bureau of Ships in Washington, D.C. Later that year he was assigned to the Manhattan Project, and moved with his family to Los Alamos, New Mexico. There he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory's Ordnance (O) Division, which was under the command of another Naval officer, Captain William S. Parsons. Initially the goal of the O Division was to design a gun-type nuclear weapon known as Thin Man. This proved to be impractical due to contamination of the reactor-bred plutonium with plutonium-240, and in February 1944, the Division switched its attention to the development of the Little Boy, a smaller device using uranium-235. Birch used unenriched uranium to create scale models and later full-scale mock-ups of the device. Birch supervised the manufacture of the Little Boy, and went to Tinian to supervise its assembly and loading it onto Enola Gay, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress tasked with dropping the bomb. He devised the 'double plug' system that allowed for actually arming the bomb after Enola Gay took off so that if it crashed, there would not be a nuclear explosion. He was awarded the Legion of Merit. His citation read:"

        "content": "Birch returned to Harvard after the war ended, having been promoted to Associate Professor of Geology in 1943 while he was away. He would remain at Harvard for the rest of his career, becoming a professor in 1946, and Sturgis Hooper Professor of Geology in 1949, and professor emeritus in 1974. Professor Birch published over 100 papers. He served as president of The Geological Society of America in 1964 and was awarded their Penrose Medal in 1969. In 1947, he adapted the isothermal Murnaghan equation of state, which had been developed for infinitesimal strain, for Eulerian finite strain, developing what is now known as the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. Albert Francis Birch is known for his experimental work on the properties of Earth-forming minerals at high pressure and temperature, in 1952 he published a well-known paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research, where he demonstrated that the mantle is chiefly composed of silicate minerals, the upper and lower mantle are separated by a thin transition zone associated with silicate phase transitions, and the inner and outer core are alloys of crystalline and molten iron. His conclusions are still accepted as correct today. The most famous portion of the paper, however, is a humorous footnote he included in the introduction: Unwary readers should take warning that ordinary language undergoes modification to a high-pressure form when applied to the interior of the Earth. A few examples of equivalents follow: In 1961, Birch published two papers on compressional wave velocities establishing a linear relation of the compressional wave velocity Vp of rocks and minerals of a constant average atomic weight  with density  as: . This relationship became known as Birch's law. Birch was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1950, and served as the president of the Geological Society of America in 1963 and 1964. He received numerous honors in his career, including the Geological Society of America's Arthur L. Day Medal on 1950 and Penrose Medal in 1969, the American Geophysical Union's William Bowie Medal in 1960, the National Medal of Science from President Lyndon Johnson in 1967, the Vetlesen Prize (shared with Sir Edward Bullard) in 1968, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1973, and the International Association for the Advancement of High Pressure Research's Bridgman Medal in 1983. Since 1992, the American Geophysical Union's Tectonophysics section has sponsored a Francis Birch Lecture, given at its annual meeting by a noted researcher in this field. Birch died of prostate cancer at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on January 30, 1992. He was survived by wife Barbara, his three children and his three brothers. His papers are in the Harvard University Archives."

He also played in college for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1963 to 1966. At Michigan, Clancy started as a quarterback, switched to halfback, returned punts and kickoffs, and became a star as an end.  In two seasons as an end (1965\u20131966), Clancy rewrote the Michigan receiving record book.  At the time of his graduation, he held the school records for most receptions and receiving yards in a career, season and game.  His 1966 total of 197 receiving yards against Oregon State remained Michigan's single-game receiving record until November 6, 2010.  He was named an All-American and also set the Big Ten Conference record for most receptions in a single season of conference play.  Though most of his records have since been broken, Clancy continues to rank among the leading receivers in Michigan history. Clancy was drafted by the Miami Dolphins of the American Football League (AFL).  In 1967, quarterback Bob Griese and Clancy were both rookies for the Dolphins. Clancy caught 67 passes that year, setting an AFL rookie record.  He was third in the AFL in receptions in 1967 and eighth in receiving yards.  He was named to the 1967 AFL All-star game.  After a sensational rookie season, Clancy suffered a serious knee injury in a 1968 exhibition game and missed the entire season.  While making a comeback in 1969, Clancy suffered an injury to his other knee.  Traded to the Green Bay Packers in 1970, Clancy was unable to return to his prior form after the knee injuries.  He made only 16 receptions in 14 games and was released by the Packers before the start of the 1971 season."

In his first game at the end position, Clancy made what was described as \"a circus catch\" in the endzone on a pass from quarterback Dick Vidmer.

        "content": "After the 1966 season, Clancy held most major school receiving records at Michigan, as well as many Big Ten Conference records.  His accomplishments included: Single season receptions in Big Ten Conference play.  Clancy was the first player with 50\u00a0receptions in Big Ten Conference play (in only seven conference games).  His record was broken in 1980 when Keith Chappelle (Iowa) and Dave Young (Purdue) each recorded 51\u00a0receptions in eight conference games.  The record was not broken on a per game rate until 1983 when Ricky Edwards (Northwestern) recorded 68\u00a0receptions in nine games. Career receptions and receiving yards.  Clancy set Michigan career records with 132\u00a0receptions and 1,919\u00a0receiving yards.  Anthony Carter broke Clancy's career receiving yards record in 1981 and his receptions record in 1982.  Clancy now ranks eleventh in receptions and thirteenth in yardage. Single game receiving yards. Clancy's 197\u00a0yards receiving was unsurpassed as the Michigan single-game record until Roy Roundtree posted 246 on November 6, 2010.  He is also the only receiver with two of the top seven and three of the top sixteen yardage games.  In addition to the 197-yard effort, Clancy had 10\u00a0receptions for 166\u00a0yards against Minnesota and 11\u00a0receptions for 179\u00a0yards against the Illinois. Single season receptions.  Clancy also set the single-season receptions record with 76 catches in 1966 (playing a 10-game schedule).  Marquise Walker broke Clancy's record with 86 receptions in 2001 (playing a 13-game schedule).  Clancy now ranks fifth in single-season receptions, but only Braylon Edwards has matched him on a comparable games basis with 76\u00a0receptions in his first 10\u00a0games of 2004. Single season yardage.  Clancy also held the single-season yardage record of 1077 until 1994 when Amani Toomer recorded 1096 in 12\u00a0games.  He currently ranks seventh on the single-season receptions list.  No receiver has surpassed his single-season yardage total in the first 10\u00a0games of the season.  Braylon Edwards (76\u00a0receptions for 1049 yards in 2004) and Mario Manningham (62 receptions for 1062 yards in 2007) are the only other Michigan receivers to reach 1000\u00a0yards in their 10th game of a season."

However, he opted to redshirt for an extra season at Michigan where he played the 1966 NCAA Division I-A football season.  He joined the Dolphins for the 1967 AFL season.  In 1967, the Dolphins' rookie quarterback Bob Griese combined with rookie receiver Clancy for 67\u00a0receptions\u2014an American Football League rookie record for pass receptions.  That year, Clancy led the Dolphins in receiving yardage and receptions, and finished eighth in the AFL in reception yards and third in receptions.  He compiled three 100-yard receiving games, and he was named to the AFL All-Star Game. In their second season together, Griese and Clancy were roommates in the pre-season and appeared ready to have a big year.  The young \"Griese-Clancy combine\" was expected to be \"a major drawing card\" for the young AFL franchise in 1968.  In the first three pre-season games in 1968, they connected for 19\u00a0receptions and 284\u00a0yards.  However, Clancy suffered a ruptured ligament in his left knee shortly after catching a pass against the Baltimore Colts in the final pre-season game on August 31, 1968.  Clancy underwent surgery and missed the 1968 season.  Clancy watched the Dolphins from the sidelines with his leg in a cast, as Karl Noonan took over at split end and led the AFL in touchdown catches in 1968. In April 1969, Clancy got married and went on a honeymoon trip around the world, swimming, surfing and \"getting some sun.\"  He said, however, marriage had not reduced his desire to play football.  \"Just the opposite\", he said. \"I'm more hungry than ever.  I want to make that money.\"  After a season on crutches, the UPI reported: \"The former rookie wonder wants to get back under quarterback Bob Griese's passes, to reclaim his billing as the Miami Dolphins' top receiver.  Despite a scar on his knee, Clancy was dashing, cutting and jumping for passes during summer workouts.  However, even Clancy acknowledged the injury had slowed him down: \"I'm still a couple of steps slower than before the operation.  But I'm optimistic.  It doesn't pain me.  I figure I have a month to work the way I want to, I'll be all right.\"  Clancy's comeback appeared to be on track in early November, as he was a close second among Miami receivers with 21 catches for 289 yards.  However, the comeback was cut short on November 2, 1969, when he suffered torn ligaments, this time to his right knee in a loss to the New York Jets.  Clancy missed the final six games of the 1969 season due to the injury."

        "content": "In May 1970, Clancy was traded by the Dolphins to the Green Bay Packers for tight end Marv Fleming.  Clancy had begun a business selling real estate in Miami during the offseason, but he also had ties to Green Bay.  He had attended St. Matthew's Grade School there in the 1950s.  Clancy expressed mixed emotions about the trade: \"I don't like to leave Miami.  You hate to have to pick up and move and I definitely plan to come back (to Miami) in the offseason.  But most of my dad's family are still up in Green Bay.  He's always wanted me to play for the Packers.\"  Clancy was greeted as the first Green Bay native to play for the Packers since Wayland Becker in 1938.  Wisconsin columnist Lee Remmel said Clancy \"surveys the football scene with a pair of cool, calculating blue eyes and a computer-type mind.\" In an August 1970 exhibition game against the New York Giants, Clancy caught four passes for 110 yards.  Packers coach Phil Bengtson said after the game, \"He has a knack of knowing where the ball will be.  Clancy doesn't have great speed, but he has the ability to recognize defenses and take advantage of them.\"  While Clancy played in all 14 games for the Packers in 1970, he caught only 16 passes, leading one Green Bay writer to conclude that Clancy's \"anemic production\" resulted in double-teaming of flanker Carroll Dale and an unbalanced passing offense.  Clancy finished fifth in receptions on the 1970 Packers, behind Dale, tight end John Hilton, running back Donny Anderson, and even fullback Jim Grabowski. Clancy tried out for the Packers again in 1971, but he was cut in August before the season started.  While attempting to make a comeback with the Dolphins in July 1972, Clancy suffered another injury, this time to his back, resulting in Clancy being placed in traction for ten days in a Miami hospital. In all, Clancy played in 36\u00a0 games for the Dolphins and Packers, compiling professional career totals of 104\u00a0 receptions for 1,301\u00a0yards.  Rick Norton was Clancy's teammate both in Miami and Green Bay."

He played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines (1966\u20131968) and professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for the Arizona Cardinals (1971), New England Patriots (1972\u20131973), San Diego Chargers (1974), Denver Broncos (1975), and New York Jets (1975). In high school, Hoey was an All-State halfback.  At the University of Michigan,  College Football Hall of Fame halfback Ron Johnson was in Hoey's class, and Hoey was therefore used principally as a defensive back.  Hoey is most remembered for his work as a punt returner at Michigan.  He led the Big Ten Conference in punt return yards in 1967 and 1968, and still holds Michigan's modern era (post-1949) records for most punt return yards in a game (140), most return yards per punt in a season (24.3) and most return yards per punt in a career (17.1).  Hoey was also a record-setting sprinter on Michigan's track and field team. In five seasons in the NFL, Hoey was principally a kickoff returner.  In 1971, he set a St. Louis Cardinals club record with six kickoff returns for 206 yards, including one for 103 yards and a touchdown. He had 534 kickoff return yards in his career. Since 1993, Hoey has worked in administration at the University of Colorado. He worked first in academic services for the athletic department.  After controversies in the late 1990s concerning eligibility of University of Colorado athletes, Hoey accepted a position in the school's career services department providing career counseling to student athletes."

As a senior in 1964, Hoey was named an All-State halfback by The Detroit News and UPI.  In naming him to its All-State team, the UPI noted: \"Hoey, a 5-foot-10, 165-pounder, gained 502 yards in 64 carries and caught 17 passes.

Physical Reductionism suggests that all science may be reduced to physical explanations due to causal or mereological links that obtain between the objects studied in the higher sciences and the objects studied by physics.  For example, a physical reductionist would see psychological facts as (in principle) reducible to neurological facts, which is in turn are reducible to biological facts.  Biology could then be explained in terms of chemistry, and chemistry could then be explained in terms of physical explanation. While reductionism of this sort is a common position among scientists and philosophers, Dupr\u00e9 suggests that such reduction is not possible as the world has an inherently pluralistic structure."

        "content": "A classical argument for reductionism relies on a particular conception of causality, according to which each event must have a sufficient physical cause. Physical interactions are therefore sufficient to account for all causal interactions.  Under this assumption, psychological or biological facts must be eliminable in favour of physical facts, given that the physical conditions do all the causal work.  This makes all the other, non-physical conditions causally superfluous. Dupr\u00e9 tries to escape this problem by rejecting determinism, and the assumption that there is a physical cause for each and every event. In place of Determinism, Dupr\u00e9 proposes a conception of indeterministic, probabilistic causality. His ideas are influenced by Nancy Cartwright."

Dupr\u00e9 argues that such projects must remain speculative and reflect on the prejudices of the researchers as circumstances in the world. Dupr\u00e9 is also concerned with the handling of biological taxonomy.  Biological classifications are made by humans, and are thus open to criticism and modification. This applies in particular to the classifications of humans \u2013 for instance after race or sex.  Dupr\u00e9's arguments in this area reflect and mirror the sentiments and criticism of evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould."

She clerked for Judge Charles Edward Wyzanski Jr. and was an associate in litigation at Bingham, Dana & Gould, Boston.  At Harvard, Brandeis, and Stanford she taught courses in the American legal system, constitutional law, Supreme Court history, federal courts, and the conflict of laws.  In 1980 she joined the law faculty at the University of Texas, where she held the Raybourn Thompson professorship, and, later, the endowed William B. Bates Chair in the Administration of Justice, formerly held by Charles Alan Wright. In 1982 she was joined in Texas by her husband, Steven Weinberg, a Nobel laureate in physics.  Louise Weinberg is author of the 1200-page study, Federal Courts: Judicial Federalism and Judicial Power (West, 1994), and numerous scholarly papers and contributions.  Her works address the sources of lawmaking power and the debate on legal theory in the conflict of laws, offering a unification of conflicts theory with constitutional theory.  She is a member of, and appointed adviser to, the American Law Institute, and she has frequently chaired sections of the Association of American Law Schools on Conflict of Laws and on Federal Courts.     Louise Weinberg became emeritus in 2021 when she was 88 years of age."

        "content": "In 1977 Weinberg introduced the concept of \"judicial federalism.\" She engaged in a 1989 debate with Martin Redish concerning controversial federal judicial lawmaking, and clarified the nature of federal common law.  Weinberg concentrated on choice-of-law theory, and proposed a reconceptualization of the field, ultimately achieving a unification of the concepts of due process, rationality, and tiered scrutiny with choice of law.  Weinberg became interested in uncovering hidden rationales in Supreme Court cases, and in this interest clarified the causative role of the Dred Scott case in the coming of the Civil War, countering revisionist normalization of Dred Scott while showing that judicial attempts to reverse Dred Scott, as opposed to constitutional amendment, would have been counterproductive.  In 2003, when Marbury v. Madison, the early Supreme Court case placing the federal government under the rule of law, came under revisionist attack, Weinberg published her defense of the case. Throughout she was interested in the problem of instantiating justice within the American dual-law, dual-court, multistate legal systems, and on the histories of the times in the backgrounds of supreme court cases on these systems."

Tuttle was born in Manti, Utah. As a young man, he served as a missionary for the LDS Church in the Northern States Mission. He began his college education at Snow College and after his mission received a bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University and a master's degree from Stanford University. He later did graduate studies at the University of Utah. During World War II, Tuttle served two-and-a-half years as a Marine Corps line officer in the Pacific theater. He played an active part in the famous Raising of the Flag on Iwo Jima. Prior to his call as a general authority, Tuttle worked as a teacher and administrator in the Church Educational System. He was a seminary teacher and principal at several locations in Utah. He was later the director of the Institute of Religion in Reno, Nevada, and from 1953 until his call as a general authority was the head of the church's seminary and institute program. Tuttle and his wife, Marne Whitaker, were the parents of seven children. Tuttle became a member of the seven-man First Council of the Seventy in 1958. In 1976, he joined the newly reconstituted First Quorum of the Seventy and became a member of the Presidency of the Seventy, where he remained until 1980. From 1980 to 1982, Tuttle was president of the church's Provo Temple. In 1986, he became the second counselor to Robert L. Simpson in the church's Sunday School general presidency, but only held this position for a few months before his death. Tuttle died of cancer in Salt Lake City, Utah."

His father was a prominent banker who, Anderson often said, was the first banker in the U.S. \"who loaned money on oil in the ground.\" Robert attended elementary and high school at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, and then continued his studies at the University of Chicago, majoring in economics and graduating in 1939. Anderson was an intellectual and considered becoming a philosophy professor. He was a member of the Omega chapter of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. During summers, he worked on pipelines in Texas. After graduating, he worked for the American Mineral Spirits Company, a subsidiary of Pure Oil. In 1941, his father helped him and his brothers buy a refinery in New Mexico."

        "content": "By 1950 Anderson owned several refineries, had built a pipeline system, and had become a wildcatter. He entered the top ranks of independent oil producers in 1957 with a major find at the Empire-Abo field in New Mexico. In 1963, Anderson merged his company into the Atlantic Refining Company of Philadelphia. In 1966, as Atlantic's chairman and chief executive, he merged with Richfield Oil of Los Angeles, forming Atlantic Richfield Company (later shortened to \"ARCO\". The company's headquarters were in New York City. In 1967, he approved recommendations from ARCO Alaska staff including geologists Marvin Mangus and John M. Sweet. His approval led to ARCO's discovery of still the largest oil field yet found in North America at Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope. That oil field has produced billions of barrels of crude and accounts for a fifth of domestic oil production. Soon after, due to the wealth gained by the finding of Prudhoe Bay oil, he merged again with Sinclair Oil, forming the United States' seventh-biggest oil company. Anderson led ARCO's move from New York City to Los Angeles in 1972, when it opened Atlantic Richfield Plaza on Flower street, which produced the twin towers of the city, for many years the tallest in the city. Anderson's long-time friendship with Herbert Bayer, former Bauhaus Master, led to Anderson's interest and eventual passion for contemporary art. An enthusiastic collector, his personal collection spilled over into his offices. By the time he and ARCO moved to LA, the Atlantic Richfield Company Corporate Art Collection had grown to more than 3,000 works, consisting of original paintings, drawings, sculpture, limited edition prints and signed photographs. The centerpiece of ARCO Plaza is the Sculpture Fountain designed by Bayer, entitled Double Ascension. It was said to have been named by Anderson with Bayer present. Apparently Anderson laughed out loud when he first heard the original title (saying he loved it, but doubted \"the Board Members & Shareholders would appreciate a sculpture titled Stairs to Nowhere\"). ARCO's nationwide art collection grew to over 15,000 original pieces under the direction of Herbert Bayer and ARCO Corporate Art Collection staff, with part of the collection housed in ARCO offices in cities other than Los Angeles. The collection was displayed throughout ARCO buildings, on both executive and working floors, in common areas, lobbies and offices as well as in many file and copy-machine rooms. ARCO was one of the first entities to utilize computer data-entry to keep track of and inventory a major art collection. When asked why a Fortune 500 company should invest in modern art, Anderson replied: \"Because I like it. It makes you think. I didn't get where I am because I took the same path as everyone else. One of the reasons ARCO is successful is that I encourage my people to look at all issues from every possible angle. That's one of the many reasons contemporary art is beneficial to society. It inspires you to think outside the box and use your imagination. If you examine a problem closely and think about all the possible solutions, you'll come up with the best possible answer. That's part of what made ARCO a success.\" Always a visionary, Anderson also led the seven-company effort to develop the Alaskan oil pipeline in 1974. From 1966 to 1982, through acquisitions and strategic diversification, Anderson grew ARCO's revenues 20-fold (from $1 billion to over $20 billion). In 1985, with crude oil prices set to plunge and hostile corporate takeovers in the offing, Anderson led a major restructuring of Arco. Upon mandatory retirement from ARCO in 1986, Anderson left to form Hondo Oil & Gas Company, Roswell, New Mexico, where he served as chairman and chief executive officer from September 1986 to February 1994."

The building, which opened in 1986, was named for Anderson (it is now the Art of the Americas Building). Anderson served as chairman of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, which convenes business executives and others to discuss world problems. He helped found the Worldwatch Institute in Washington to monitor global environmental trends, the International Institute for Environment and Development in London to study environmental and food issues, and the John Muir Institute of the Environment in Davis, California.

In 1979 he provided the cover art for Penguin's paperback edition of Edmund White's novel Nocturnes for the King of Naples. During the 1980s, his work covered many commercial media. He created album covers for CBS Records and book covers for numerous other novels, usually in the genres of fantasy, mystery, or horror. He provided illustrations for the science/science-fiction magazine OMNI and (in 1989) a front cover for Time magazine. He also received professional recognition from his peers, receiving the Society of Illustrators's Gold Medal (Editorial category) in 1982 and a Silver Medal (Book category) in 1987. He has exhibited his work in New York City at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and the Society of Illustrators. Edmund White wrote in his Introduction to Dreamer:  \"Mel Odom's work represents an original synthesis of...two moments in the history of taste:  a recuperation of art-nouveau perversities of the past but in a shiny, shadowless, innocently hedonistic space....In Mel Odom's world the perverse has become at last a candid pleasure...a vision of utopia.\" In 1990, Odom proposed to design the cosmetic facepaint for Mdvanii, a 25\u00a0cm limited-edition collector's fashion doll. The experience renewed his childhood interest in dolls and led him to create a doll of his own, the 15.5\" Gene Marshall. The creation of Gene Marshall helped him cope with the experience of his best friend dying of AIDS. Gene Marshall's appearance, wardrobes, and history are modelled on the glamour of Hollywood's golden age from the 1920s through 1950s. The doll made its commercial debut at the 1995 Toy Fair and was an immediate success, creating a wider market for large, fully articulated collector's fashion dolls in contrast to the slightly smaller and less flexible Barbie doll. Since then, Odom has largely concentrated his professional pursuits on the Gene Marshall doll, regularly modifying her design to create new variations and creating similar companion dolls to share her world, such as Gene's \"co-stars\" Madra Lord, Violet Waters, and Trent Osborn. Odom continues to attend doll collectors' conventions to make personal appearances and buy dolls for his own collection, as well as to support charitable causes.  At a 1997 doll convention entirely devoted to Gene Marshall, a charity auction of uniquely modified Gene dolls raised more than $30,000 for Gay Men's Health Crisis, an AIDS service organization."

        "content": "Weeks was born to Harrison Samuel Weeks, Sr. (April 5, 1845 \u2013 January 23, 1892) and Julia W. Weeks (n\u00e9e Shoemaker) (March 13, 1852 \u2013 November 28, 1930), who married on January 14, 1874 in Fort Union, New Mexico. He was born in Fort McIntosh, Texas, where his father, a West Point graduate and career military officer originally from Allegan, Michigan, was stationed at the time. His parents met while his father was stationed at Fort Union, New Mexico, as his mother's family was from nearby rural Mora County, New Mexico. He spent his early childhood growing up on military posts in New Mexico and Texas, where his father was stationed until the family finally moved back to his father's native Allegan, Michigan in 1888. He was the fourth-oldest of eight brothers, five of whom played football for the University of Michigan, and one sister. Three of the brothers earned varsity letters in football, and the oldest of those three brothers, Alanson Weeks (September 15, 1877 \u2013 November 25, 1947), played halfback for the 1898 Michigan team that won the school's first Western Conference championship. His eldest brother, Frank Russel Weeks (March 21, 1876 \u2013 March 2, 1947), instead became a soldier like their father and later a civil servant working for the US Treasury Department. Boss Weeks enrolled at Michigan in 1899 and played on the school's \"scrub team\" as a freshman.  As a sophomore, Weeks made the varsity football team where he was the backup quarterback to Edwin McGinnis.  In 1901, a new era in Michigan football began as Fielding H. Yost was hired as the school's new football coach.  Yost immediately taught Weeks and the Michigan team a new, lightning-fast offense.  Under the new scheme, Weeks would call the signals for the next play without a huddle, sometimes while he was \"still under the pile from the previous play.\"  If a player was too slow getting line up for the next play, Yost would yell from the sideline, \"Are you a spectator?  Hurry up!  Hurry up!\" Weeks started all 11 games at quarterback for the 1901 Michigan Wolverines and had tremendous success with Yost's new system.  In the early days of football when Weeks played, the quarterback was the true field general, as there were no communications with the bench, and the quarterback had the responsibility to call the plays on both offense and defense.  The 1901 team led by Weeks went undefeated and scored 550 points, earning the team the nickname, \"Point-a-Minute.\"  The 1901 team was equally strong on defense, not allowing a single point to be scored through the entire season, and not allowing another team to make a gain of more than 15 yards on a single play.  Michigan was invited to play in the first Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, California on January 1, 1902, where they defeated Stanford, 49\u20130. The following June, the Michigan team elected Weeks as the captain of the 1902 team.  Weeks led the 1902 team to another 11\u20130 record, and the team increased its offensive scoring output to an unprecedented 644 points.  The team scored 119 points against Michigan Agricultural and 107 points against Iowa.  The only minor blemish on the record of the 1902 team was that, after not allowing opponents to score a single point in 1901, the defense gave up a total of 12 points in 11 games. Some consider the 1901 and 1902 \"Point-a-Minute\" teams to be the greatest teams in Michigan Wolverines football history.  Looking back in 1930, Fielding Yost said of Weeks: \"Michigan had one outstanding leader: Boss Weeks, quarterback of the first two teams I coached here.  Weeks was the leader without reproach.  He drove two Michigan teams to a total of 1,211 points against 12.  Had he told either team to charge a stone wall, it would have done so, I believe, so much did the teams believe in him.\" In addition to his talent at football, Weeks was reported to have been \"a clever student,\" a member of the Delta Chi fraternity, and one of the most popular students on the campus."

In March 1906, The Washington Post reported that Michigan students were mourning the loss of Weeks who was \"considered the greatest field general that Michigan ever had, and was immensely popular with the students at that institution.\"  Ten years after Weeks' death, Coach Yost said: \"Boss Weeks' two teams scored more than 1200 points.  If that team had been in front of the Chinese Wall and got the signal to go, not a man would have hesitated.  Every man that played under Boss Weeks idolized him, and when word was brought to the university that he had died, every Michigan man felt that its university had lost one of its greatest men.\" He was laid to rest in Oakwood Cemetery, Allegan, Michigan next to his mother's eventual grave site near his father's grave."

When she was eighteen, she enrolled in the Art Students League of New York where she took classes from John Twachtman and George Bridgman.  She then traveled to Paris in 1902 to continue her studies at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian where she was the first woman to be awarded the Concours Julian-Smith in 1904. On her return to the United States, she began to earn commissions mainly for her meticulous illustrations in magazines and books, like those she drew for Helen Hay Whitney's book of poems, entitled Herbs and Apples (1910). In San Antonio, Texas, she helped form the San Antonio Conversation Society in 1924.  In 1926 she met Diego Rivera. As Rivera was finishing his mural project at the Ministry of Education in Mexico City, Mrs. Van Horn joined him and other artists in the production of the work.  Rivera painted her face in one of the murals on the third floor of the building. For four years (1928\u201332), she and her husband lived in Berkeley, California where she joined various art leagues and worked with prominent artists in the Bay Area, including John Emmett Gerrity, David Park and Galka Scheyer who represented The Blue Four:  European abstractionists, Feininger, Kandinsky, Jawlensky and Klee.  She also became a member of the San Francisco Art Association and the Society of Women Artist, won several notable awards, and was included in a major international retrospective at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco as one of thirty-five American artists. During a trip to Mexico is 1926, Van Horn met and befriended Diego Rivera. He was working on a mural for the Ministry of Education in Mexico city at the time. During her time in Mexico, Van Horn was greatly influenced by Rivera which led to a major transformation in her work. Her subject matter became mostly native peasant women, pictured in an outside setting and much more simplified than her earlier works. She returned to Berkeley in 1941 after her husband died.  She contacted an old Berkeley colleague, Marjorie Eaton who lived in Palo Alto on the Juana Briones Ranch, owned by Ms. Eaton's mother.  There she spent the last twenty-eight years of her life. Mrs. Van Horn's life was peripatetic and at times difficult.  Her mother died when she was three, and shortly after moved from her family's sugar plantation on the Mississippi River to New Orleans.  When she fourteen, she went to live in Washington, D.C. with her socially and politically involved aunt and uncle, Martha and Herbert Wadsworth. In Washington she met Douglas MacArthur, who fell in love with her, as evidenced by a recently discovered cache of letters written to her by him. Around the same time she met her husband Robert Osborn Van Horn; they were married in 1908.  Van Horn was also a military officer who subsequently served under MacArthur during the First World War and retired as a brigadier general in 1940. During her married years, Mrs. Van Horn lived in many places: Cuba, Georgia, Kansas, Texas, and California.  She and her husband had two daughters: Margaret born in 1909 and Lucretia in 1916.  When Margaret contracted tuberculosis and died in 1932, Mrs. Van Horn, devastated by the loss, left her family for some time.  It is not clear where she went or for how long. Mrs. Van Horn's artistic evolution went through at least three distinctive phases.  Her early illustrations reflect her attraction to the work of Maxfield Parrish, her work of the late 1920s and 1930s are patterned on the images of Diego Rivera, and her later work was influenced by the European abstractionists, most especially her favorite, Paul Klee."

Born in Philadelphia, he studied classics at Yale, but was expelled for participating in the Conic Sections Rebellion. He then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in the same year, where he received an A.B. degree in 1832. He went on to get an A.M. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1835 and in 1836 an M.D. from the school's department of medicine. He settled to practice in his native city, but spent parts of 1841 and 1851 in Paris and Vienna.  From 1854 to 1859 he was professor of medicine at the Pennsylvania Medical College and from 1864 to 1884 at the University of Pennsylvania, later becoming its Chair. Still\u00e9 was one of the first in America to distinguish between typhus and typhoid fever. His observations in this connection he made during a typhus epidemic in Philadelphia in 1836 and reported in 1838.  He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1852. He acquired a great reputation as a practitioner, teacher, and writer, and was the first secretary, and in 1871\u201372 the president, of the American Medical Association. However, as evidenced by his later writings, he was also known for refusing to accept the germ theory or laboratory medicine."

        "content": "As the author of more than twenty-five books and editor of numerous other titles, Horowitz analyzed such diverse topics as the influence of Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church on American politics, the future of book publishing, and politics in Cuba. Horowitz was the founder of Studies in Comparative International Development. He was also chairman of Transaction Publishers. Early in his career, Horowitz was a student of Leftist sociologist C. Wright Mills, a Texas-born professor at Columbia University whose most significant books include, White Collar, The Power Elite, and The Sociological Imagination. Horowitz edited two posthumous collections of Mills' work, including The cultural apparatus. Over the several decades until his death Horowitz worked to develop a political sociology that can measure the extent of a society's personal freedom and State-sanctioned violence. As a result of his work, a standard for the quality of life in any particular nation or social system has been constructed based on the number of people arbitrarily killed, maimed, injured, incarcerated, or deprived of basic civil liberties. Horowitz tried to build a bridge between his current analysis of state power and authority and his earlier studies of comparative international stratification and development. He was key to introducing the phrase \"Third World\" into the lexicon of social research. Horowitz articulated the view that republication of previous publications in different formats is necessary in the social sciences to disseminate research results and make them useful to society. Horowitz wrote about genocide: \u201cFirst comes the act and then comes the word: first [the crime of] genocide is committed and then the language emerges to describe a phenomenon.\" He published lasting contributions on the subject, including Genocide: State power & mass murder; Taking lives: Genocide & state power; and \"Genocide and the reconstruction of social theory: Observations on the exclusivity of collective death\" in Armenian Review. Horowitz's last scholarly pieces on genocide were his preface to R. J. Rummel's Death by government, and his essay on state-sponsored terror, \"Counting Bodies. The Dismal Science of Authorized Terror\" in Patterns of Prejudice. In Summer 1994, a volume of essays in honour of Horowitz was published by Transaction Publishers. In 1990, he published an autobiography, a brief \"sociological biography\" rather than one that is intellectual or intimate. This was Daydreams and nightmares:  Reflections on a Harlem childhood, for which he received the National Jewish Book Award in 1991. It is an unromanticized look at growing up as the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants in the streets of predominantly black Harlem, New York City, in the 1930s. Among his most recent books are Tributes: Personal reflections on a century of social research; and Behemoth: Main currents in the history and theory of political sociology. A list of scholarly publications including more than two hundred works by Horowitz is found at the beta-version of Google Scholar."

He wrote: \"The decomposition of sociology began when this great tradition became subject to ideological thinking, and an inferior tradition surfaced in the wake of totalitarian triumphs.\" Sociologist George Steinmetz challenged Horowitz.

Brown studied with Hoosier Group painter J. Ottis Adams while still a high school student before enrolling at the John Herron Art Institute, where he studied under Hoosier Group painter William Forsyth. Brown also studied at Ball State, and earned a master of arts degree from Ohio State University. Brown was a member Indiana Art Club and the Hoosier Salon.

Brown's talent in art was apparent at an early age. He began formal art training with private art instruction from Hoosier Group painter J. Ottis Adams at The Hermitage (Adams's home in Brookville, Indiana) The course that Adams offered lasted only seven weeks, so Brown rented a room  to be near Adams, whom he described in later years as \"a wonderfully kind and inspiring teacher\" After high school, Brown enrolled at the John Herron Art Institute, where he studied under Hoosier Group painter William Forsyth, and graduated from Herron in 1916. Brown also studied at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, Ball State University, and later earned a Master of Arts degree from Ohio State University. In addition to Adams and Forsyth, James R. Hopkins was another of Brown's instructors."

Hazelrigg (1892\u20131987), an Indiana native, taught school for two years at Oolitic, Indiana, and graduated from Cincinnati Conservatory of Music in 1913 before enrolling at the Herron Art Institute on scholarship in the fall of 1915. Brown and Hazelrigg were students of William Forsyth, who felt that art students should make art their priority and remain single. Ignoring their art teacher's advice, they married while they were still students. The Browns spent the remainder of their lives together as artists and educators. They also had two sons: Hillis Alvin (1919\u20131983) and Folger Wescott (1922\u2013??). During the Great Depression, Brown's widowed mother-in-law moved in with the family to help with the housekeeping and childcare, so that he and his wife could pursue their careers."

        "content": "After graduating from the John Herron Art Institute in 1916, Brown taught at Wingate and Mitchell, Indiana, for two years. In 1918 he became a teacher at Richmond, Indiana, where the Browns remained for the next seven years. Brown joined the faculty at Ball State Teachers College (present-day Ball State University), in 1925. The family, which now included two sons, moved to Muncie, Indiana, which remained Brown's home until his death in 1971. In 1932, the Browns had an art studio added to the rear of their home, where they worked on their art. The studio was also a gathering place for their two sons and their friends. Brown was a professor and director of Ball State's Fine Arts Department from 1925 to 1957, when he retired as Professor Emeritus. He was also director of the Ball State Art Gallery until 1946. As Brown pursued a career as an art educator, his artistic progress earned him recognition as a talented painter. Brown regularly exhibited his art at Hoosier Salon shows between 1922 and 1964, where he won a number of cash awards for his oils, pastels, and watercolors in 1925, 1926, 1928, 1929, 1937, and in 1945. He also exhibited his work at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1922 and 1923, the Indiana Art Club, the John Herron Art Institute, the Cincinnati Museum of Art, the Richmond Art Association, and the Indiana State Fair. Brown won prizes at a Richmond Art Association exhibition and at a Herron exhibition in 1922. He also exhibited his work at Western Art Association shows, as well as the Cleveland Museum of Art and other local, regional, and national art exhibitions and organizations, including the Richmond Group, a well-known collective of Indiana artists working in the Richmond, Indiana, area. Brown was diagnosed with glaucoma in 1949 and retired from teaching at Ball State in 1957. Brown gave up his studio at Ball State, but continued to paint in retirement in the home studio he shared with his wife. In his later years, as he began working more hours at home, Brown switched from oils to water-based media such as tempera, acrylic, watercolor, pastel, charcoal and pencil, largely because oils irritated Beulah Brown's allergies. Only a small percentage of his work was created in encaustics or oils."

        "content": "During his formative years as an educator, Brown developed a personal style that bordered on impressionism. His juxtaposed strokes of contrasting color later lead him to better understand and assimilate his own version of impressionism. Unlike many other impressionists of the era, Brown expanded the boundaries of impressionism beyond many of his contemporaries, including departures that encompassed both the Fauve and Expressionist movements. In his artistic expressions, Brown experimented with bold colors and, often, nearly formless subject matter that was intertwined with atmospherics and light in a manner similar in stubstance to Charles Burchfield's watercolors and Vincent van Gogh's signature style, especially when Brown worked in egg tempera or in oils. Throughout his life, Brown maintained a consistent pattern of experimentation, clearly demonstrating his intention to move beyond impressionism. Brown's subject matter often focused on the Hoosier countryside using atmospheric effects and light. Works undertaken later in his later years were much more broadly brush stroked that his earlier works, often focusing on life pictures that reveal a spontaneity to those in his early landscapes. Among his peers, Brown's interpretation of atmospherics was regarded as vastly superior to many of his older colleagues, who largely sacrificed their conservative palettes in order to exploit a more decorative artificiality. Brown's use of brightly-pigmented tempera, which created a depth and texture similar to that found in many of the great post-impressionist painters, appears to amplify the effects of atmospherics and light. Brown's subject matter was equally far reaching, including portraits, still life, marine art, landscape art, architectural art, and industrial scenes. Brown's work, as revealed in several exceptionally spontaneous works, captured the essence of the Midwestern atmosphere, and, more importantly, the feeling of a simple place and time. Brown's brushwork and rapid manipulation of bright pigments were successful in simplifying elements and forms for the viewer."

Brown's works are in the collections of the Ball State University Museum of Art, the  Indianapolis Museum of Art (formerly the Herron Art Institute), and the Richmond Art Museum. Brown's portrait was painted by Wayman Elbridge Adams, who studied at the Herron School of Art and was known for his portraiture that included prominent artists, political leaders, and authors such as Booth Tarkington."

Born in Kent, England, she attended both Bennington College in America and the Guildhall School of Music, in London, as well as the National Opera Studio. Actor Mark Rylance is one of her brothers. For twelve years, she worked as an opera singer, performing principal roles in many of the world's leading opera houses, including the Royal Opera House, Glyndebourne Festival Opera, Welsh National Opera, Scottish Opera, New York City Opera, Santa Fe Opera Festival, LA Opera, Seattle Opera, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, and Royal Swedish Opera. In 2002, she left singing to become a writer and stage director. Her first novel, Long Gone Anybody, was published by Black Swan in 2004, and short-listed for the Pendleton May Award and Geoffrey Faber Award.  Her second novel, Cold Comfort, published by Black Swan in 2006, featured on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme as one of the first fictional novels dealing with the effects of climate change. She is currently completing her third. She was an Associate Tutor in Creative Writing at the University of Sussex, and has tutored for the Arvon Foundation as well as mentoring for The Literary Consultancy. Her first music theatre piece, the regina monologues, was commissioned by the Covent Garden Festival in 2001, and starred, in respective productions, Penelope Keith, Janet Suzman and Susannah York. Other commissions for theatre have included The One I Love, a music theatre piece on conscientious objection to war for New Kent Opera, It\u2019s Your Funeral, Baby, for Brighton-based company Theatre and Beyond, and Red All Over, a site-specific play performed in six rooms of a hotel, commissioned by the Lewes Live Literature Festival. Her most recent play, Eat This, was produced in a disused brewery and revived in the autumn of 2011 with the addition of an accompanying piece, Drink That. In 2004, she founded her own production company, The Paddock, and as the Artistic Director, devised and produced theatre, dance and opera projects, including the children\u2019s theatre piece, Elsie Piddock Skips in Her Sleep, a new touring production of Daisy Ashford\u2019s The Young Visiters, a one-day outdoor dance festival, Something to Dance About, involving seven newly commissioned dances, and The Shoe Nail Dance, a High Street dance involving 200 people. In 2007, she commissioned and directed The Finnish Prisoner, a new opera from the composer Orlando Gough and librettist Stephen Plaice. The Finnish Prisoner had its world premi\u00e8re in a warehouse in Lewes in a co-production with Finnish National Opera and was nominated for a Royal Philharmonic Society award in three categories. In 2005 and 2007, Waters worked with Sir Thomas Allen, leading a large-scale education project at the Sage Gateshead Music Centre on Mozart\u2019s Cos\u00ec fan tutte (2005) and Don Giovanni (2007), and culminating in the creation and performance of youth versions of the two operas. In 2013, Waters directed a new main stage community opera for Glyndebourne Festival Opera, co-devised with the composer Orlando Gough, librettist Stephen Plaice, and designer Es Devlin. In November 2013, she directed Chabrier\u2019s L\u2019Etoile for New Sussex Opera, and in May 2014 she directed a new production of Harrison Birtwistle\u2019s Down by the Greenwood Side for the Brighton Festival."

        "content": "Byers was born in Wallasey, Cheshire. He was the son of Charles Cecil Byers (1888\u20131957), a Lloyd's underwriter, who was Liberal candidate for Westbury at the 1935 general election. He moved with the family to Potters Bar and was educated at Westminster School, followed by Christ Church, Oxford, where he won a Blue for athletics.  At Oxford he was president of the Union of Liberal Students and president of the University Liberal Club.  His treasurer was Harold Wilson, later Labour Party prime minister. Byers was also an exchange scholar at Milton Academy, Massachusetts. While at the University of Oxford, where he gained his degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, he met Joan Oliver, whom he married in 1939. They had a son and three daughters. Joan Oliver was a committed Liberal in her own right and was a constant help to her husband during his political career. Byers was admitted to Gray's Inn after university, but broke off his legal education to enlist. During the Second World War, Byers served in the Royal Artillery, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and for a time serving on Field Marshal Montgomery's staff.  He was mentioned in dispatches three times, was created a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre. In 1944 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. In the 1945 general election, Byers gained the formerly Conservative seat of North Dorset, with the absence of a Labour candidate being a key factor in this success. In 1946 Byers was appointed Liberal Chief Whip and gained a reputation for hard work and effective organisation both in parliament and at Liberal Party headquarters. However he was unable to hold the seat in 1950, losing by just 97 votes to the Conservatives following Labour's decision to stand a candidate. He unsuccessfully tried to re-enter the House of Commons in 1960 at the Bolton East by-election. On 22 December 1964 Byers was created a life peer as Baron Byers, of Lingfield in the County of Surrey and three years later he became leader of the Liberal peers. He was created a Privy Councillor in 1972. Outside Parliament, Byers was a businessman, a director of Rio Tinto Zinc from 1962\u201373 and a broadcaster. He died of a heart attack on 6 February 1984. A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 5 April 1984. His daughter Louise married Dipak Nandy, an Indian academic and politician. Louise's daughter, Lisa Nandy, is a Labour MP."

In speech that\u2019s direct, lyrical, spontaneous, raw, and expansive, Simms braves a wide array of subjects that range from his sister\u2019s suicide, the 1982 El Calabozo massacre in El Salvador,  a Vietnam vet\u2019s memory of a slaughter of innocents, and the demise of the American Ash, to mention only a few. And there are ecstatic poems as well in which such immense particulars as the marriage bed, evening, Simms\u2019 robust son, and the hummingbird betray a heroic magnanimity. With a beat-like voice that\u2019s spontaneous, raw, and irrepressible, Simms writes with the courage of a witness and the wisdom of a survivor. These poems leap, lament, pierce, transcend, delve, witness, praise, and testify to the curative power of poetry.\"Regarding Simms' collection Nightjar, the poet and classicist Rachel Hadas wrote:\u201cThis powerful collection offers personal and global truths that are hard to say out loud; one poem even helpfully coins the words we need. But all the words deployed by Michael Simms are honest and urgent. \u2018The Ruins,\u2019 \u2018Flood and Fire,\u2019 and the title poem recall the darkly vatic voice of Brecht\u2019s late lyrics. Yet, Simms always sounds like himself: plainspoken, intimate, vulnerable, courageous. Both heartening and heartbreaking, Nightjar is an irreplaceable book.\u201d"

Boyd was born and raised in Mount Orab, Ohio. He came to Oxford, Ohio in September 1903 as a third-year preparatory student in the Miami Academy. He began his college work in 1904. At Miami, Boyd was both an athlete and one of the most silver-tongued of Miami's orators. He was a distance runner, representing the varsity track team in the mile and 880-yard events. He captained the team in his senior year and acquired the nickname \"Teeny\" because of his slight runner's build, and he was active on the intramural track and basketball teams. Boyd was a four-year member of the Miami Union Literary Society and was elected vice-president. His speech, \"Emancipation of a Backward Race,\" won him the gold medal in the university's oratorical contest in 1907. After Miami, Boyd enrolled in the University of Cincinnati's law school, and then transferred to the University of Michigan, where he earned his law degree in 1910. He opened a law office in Middletown, Ohio. Boyd was a persistent politician and a successful county judge who ran several times for statewide office in Ohio without success. He was defeated in the Republican primary of 1924 for Lieutenant Governor of Ohio and was defeated in the 1926, 1928 and 1944 Republican primaries for Ohio Attorney General. He was appointed to the common pleas bench of Butler County, Ohio in 1929 and was twice reelected to that position, retiring in 1937. He was defeated in the Republican primary for Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court in 1938 and 1950 and was defeated in the general elections for judge of the Ohio Supreme Court in 1940 and 1946 and in the Republican primary in 1948. Boyd remained actively interested in the Phi Kappa Tau throughout his life. He was the first person elected to the position of national organizer at the fraternity's Danville, Kentucky, convention of 1915; and worked aggressively to extend the fraternity to Northwestern, Wabash, Purdue, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Carnegie Tech. He was a frequent speaker at Founders' Day gatherings at Miami and around the country. In the final year of his life, he visited several chapters and alumni on the West Coast. Boyd helped to initiate his son, Clinton Dewitt, Jr., into Phi Kappa Tau at Miami University in 1948; and Boyd's grandson, Mark, is also a member. Boyd was killed in an automobile accident in September 1950 when the car he was driving skidded on a slick road en route to the Ohio Republican Convention. He was interred at Woodside Cemetery, Middletown, Ohio."

He received his law degree from Harvard after the war, was admitted to the bar in 1920, and commenced practice in New York City as assistant to Henry L. Stimson. He later joined the law firm that is now known as Cravath, Swaine & Moore, and stayed with it for more than 50 years. While at Cravath, he won big cases for IBM, Westinghouse Electric, Bethlehem Steel, General Motors, Esquire magazine, and other corporate giants. On January 14, 1949, he was appointed by Governor Thomas E. Dewey to the New York Court of Appeals, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Thomas D. Thacher. In November 1949, he was defeated by Democrat Charles W. Froessel when running for a full term. In 1969, he appeared for the U.S. House of Representatives in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Powell v. McCormack, in which Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. questioned his exclusion from the House. Bromley died at the New York Hospital\u2014Cornell Medical Center.

He did his doctoral work in the Loch Monar area of the Scottish Highlands working on the strain patterns seen in intensely deformed and repeatedly folded rocks of the Moine Series and the relationships seen between folded basement and its cover rocks obtaining a PhD in 1954. After undertaking military service as a musician (Violoncellist and Tenor drummer) in the Corps of the Royal Engineers of Great Britain, he was appointed to a teaching position at the Geology department of Imperial in 1957. Many of his early fundamental research papers were written whilst at Imperial where he became Professor of Structural Geology in 1966. In the following year he published his first book, Folding and Fracturing of Rocks, which garnered him attention in structural geology. He went on to win awards in his field From 1973 to 1976 he was Professor and Head of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Leeds. In 1976, he was appointed a Professor of Geology at the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule (and University of Z\u00fcrich), Switzerland, and he was Professor Emeritus in both these departments. He held a \"Doctorat Honoris Causa\" of the University of Rennes, France and was an honorary professor at the University of Cardiff in Wales. Prof. Richard J. Lisle from Cardiff is the co-author of his 4th book on Application of continuum mechanics to structural geology. He undertook extensive field work in the Barberton greenstone belt of South Africa and Zimbabwe, and in the East African rift in Sudan apart from his contributions to the Alpine structural geology before and while at Zurich and the great forte of his, the Caledonian belt of the Scottish Highlands. He continued to do structural geology research work until the end of his life, and made structural field studies in the Moine thrust zone of northwest highlands of Scotland as an Honorary Research Adviser to the Geological Survey of UK and Ireland. Although officially retired from active geological teaching at ETH Z\u00fcrich, he continued to teach violoncello (he always loved playing cello) and Chamber Music performance in Isirac, France and was actively engaged in doing the musical compositions. John Ramsay was author and co-author of four books and many papers in structural geology. He always was of the opinion that the structures actually observed in naturally deformed rocks form the key to our understanding of the tectonic processes and that the development of mechanical models for the origin of these structures must always be compared with natural observations if they are to be truly relevant. This was probably the reason why in all his papers, the theoretical part is first supplemented by experimental simulation followed by photographs of natural examples."

However, on December 11, 2008, Devendorf was suspended indefinitely, pending appeal, from Syracuse University. The suspension was the result of a university judicial board hearing stemming from an incident involving Devendorf and a female student. Devendorf was accused of striking the female student in the face during an altercation in the early morning hours of November 1. The board found that Devendorf had violated three out of the five student codes he was accused of. Furthermore, Devendorf was already on disciplinary probation as the result of harming a student during the spring 2008 semester.  The university judicial board recommended he be suspended for the remainder of the academic year, which his coach Jim Boeheim thought was too severe. Devendorf, as expected, appealed. The Appeals board rendered its decision effective on December 19, 2008, upon which Devendorf was suspended. Upon his completion of 40 hours of community service, he would be allowed to rejoin the university and the basketball team. After completing his 40 hours of community service, Devendorf was reinstated by the University on December 27. In April 2009, Devendorf declared himself eligible for the NBA draft with one year of NCAA eligibility remaining, foregoing his senior season."

His father, also named Jonathan Dixon, came to the United States in 1848 and was followed in 1850 by his family, settling in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He graduated from Rutgers College in 1859 and was admitted to the New Jersey bar in 1862. He moved to Jersey City to practice law in 1865. Dixon was associated with New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Gilbert Collins until 1875, when he was appointed to be a Supreme Court Justice by Governor Joseph D. Bedle. He was subsequently reappointed by Governors Ludlow, Green, Griggs, and Murphy. In February 1880 the socialist leader Joseph Patrick McDonnell, editor of the Labor Standard, was tried for libel after publishing a letter from a brick maker who said of the Clark & Van Blarcom brickyard that the men were overworked and starved, and housed in places no better than pigsties. Dixon presided over the much-publicized trial, earning a reputation for being anti-labor. McDonnell was convicted and sentenced to two months in jail. When he was released on 1 April 1880 he was met by a cheering crowd. Dixon declined to take an active part in politics, and even when New Jersey Republicans nominated him for governor in 1883, he refused to make political speeches, since he felt it would be beneath the dignity of a Supreme Court Justice. McDonnell used the Labor Standard to attack Dixon as anti-labor and anti-union, and threw his support behind Leon Abbett, giving a useful boost to the Democratic candidate. Abbett, also from Jersey City, attacked Dixon for drafting the \"thieves' charter\" that deprived the Jersey City Irish of power in 1871. Abbett also criticized Dixon for handing down Supreme Court rulings that were perceived as anti-labor. Abbett defeated Dixon by a margin of 103,856 to 97,047. Dixon continued to serve as Supreme Court Justice until his death. He died in 1906 at his daughter's home in Englewood, New Jersey at the age of 66."

She is founder and director of the non-profit Young Voices on Climate Change aka Young Voices for the Planet. Through YVFP she has produced 13 short documentary films - the Young Voices for the Planet film series- dedicated to inspiring young people to believe in their ability to make change and take action inspired by the youth success stories in the films. The films have been licensed by American Public Television and were broadcast on PBS stations nationwide. An accompanying curriculum was on the PBS Learning Media website. The films have been licensed by National Geographic, the Children's Environmental Literacy Foundation (CELF), Earth Day Network and dozens of other organizations and are used widely by educators to help develop youth self-efficacy - their belief in themselves to make a difference in the world. Cherry's [Young Voices for the Planet] films document California kids getting a ban on plastic bags Team Marine; Florida students saving their school $53,000 in energy bills Dreaming in Green; and 11-year-old Felix Finkbeiner from Germany planting a million trees (Plant for the Planet). When the three 9-year-old girls in Save Tomorrow see the other Young Voices for the Planet films, they are inspired to testify at their Town Meeting where they succeed in overturning a bill prohibiting solar panels on town buildings. (Solar panels were then installed on all town buildings). Olivia's Birds and the Oil Spill features a girl from Long Island, NY who raised $200,000 to help save and clean oiled birds from the BP spill or getting fresh, local, healthy & nutritious cafeteria and calculating the \"food miles\" that their cafeteria fare travels Longing for a Local Lunch. Cherry also wrote a chapter for the National Geographic book Written in Water and the chapter \"Kids Can Save Forests\" in Treetops at Risk (Springer Verlag, 2013), edited by Margaret D. Lowman (Canopy Meg), et al. She has spoken out widely eschewing gloom and doom in climate change education and communication - on an NPR radio show and in book chapters \"Teaching Climate Change with Hope and Solutions\" in the book Education in Times of Environmental Crisis: Teaching Children to be Agents of Change (Routledge, 2016) and blogs."

Nicknamed \"Ober\", he was born and raised in Davenport, Iowa, but he lived most of his adult life in Minnesota.  Oberholtzer attended Harvard University and received a bachelor of arts degree, but left after one year of graduate study in landscape architecture.  He made his first trip to the Minnesota-Ontario border lakes in 1906. In 1909 he took his first extended canoe voyage through the border lakes and the Rainy Lake watershed, traveling 3,000 miles that summer.  During the period from 1908 to 1915, Oberholtzer wrote a number of articles and short stories, some under the penname Ernest Carliowa.  Many of the stories and articles were based on his canoe trip experiences.  In 1913, Oberholtzer moved to Rainy Lake.  He purchased Mallard Island in 1922; the tiny island would be his home for more than 50 years. After plans were announced by business mogul Edward Backus to construct a series of dams to harness the Rainy Lake watershed for power generation, Oberholtzer spoke in opposition at a hearing of the International Joint Commission held at International Falls in September 1925.  As a result of meetings with Minneapolis businessmen who were similarly opposed to industrialization of the area, the Quetico-Superior Council was formed in 1928.  Oberholtzer served as its first president.  His activities for the council included lobbying United States Congress and the Minnesota legislature, testifying before the International Joint Commission and building public support for the council's program.  In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the President's Quetico-Superior Committee to advise and coordinate government activity concerning the Quetico-Superior area. Oberholtzer was its first chairman, and served as a member until 1968. Oberholtzer was one of the eight founding members of The Wilderness Society and served on its executive council from 1937 until 1967.  His addition to The Wilderness Society lent national stature to the group.  In addition to his wilderness campaigning, he spoke fluent Ojibwe and was a fervent student of their culture.  He never married and died in 1977 after a long period of ill health. Oberholtzer is recognized today as a leading advocate for the preservation of the Quetico-Superior lake area, as well as an advocate of the Native American culture in that region.  The Minneapolis Star Tribune selected Oberholtzer as one of the 100 Most Influential Minnesotans of the 20th century."

Morrison was the son of Alfred Morrison, of Fonthill House, and the grandson of James Morrison. Hugh Morrison was his elder brother and Lord Margadale his nephew. A rower and expert shot, Morrison became a second lieutenant in the 4th (Eton Volunteer) Battalion, Oxfordshire Light Infantry on 12 December 1891, and transferred to the 4th Middlesex Volunteer Rifle Corps on 15 May 1895. He transferred to the Grenadier Guards on 5 February 1895, and subsequently fought in the Second Boer War. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Wilton division of Wiltshire at an unopposed by-election in July 1900. He was re-elected at the 1900 general election, but at the 1906 election he lost his seat to the Liberal Party candidate. In 1910, he inherited Basildon Park from his uncle Charles (son of James Morrison), and was elected  MP for Nottingham East. He resigned the seat in 1912 by the procedural device of accepting the post of Steward of the Manor of Northstead. In 1912 he was named as the co-respondent in a divorce case between Helena Woodley Morand and her husband, the actor M. R. Morand. Both Helena Morand and Morrison denied adultery but the case was found proved and M. R. Morand was awarded \u00a35,500 in agreed damages against Captain Morrison. Morrison made major improvements to the Basildon estate, building new cottages and pumping stations to supply it with water. When the First World War broke out, he returned to the Grenadier Guards. Harold Macmillan served as a lieutenant under his command. Badly wounded at the Battle of the Somme, he was invalided out of the Army and turned over Basildon Park for use as a Guards' convalescent home. He was awarded the DSO in 1916. Morrison sold off the Basildon estate to Sir Edward Iliffe in 1929 and died in 1934."

        "content": "Laurence Urdang (March 21, 1927\u00a0\u2013 August 21, 2008) was a lexicographer, editor and author noted for first computerising the unabridged Random House Dictionary of the English Language, published in 1966.  He was also the founding editor of Verbatim, a quarterly newsletter on language. Urdang was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Fieldston School in The Bronx. He then entered the Naval Reserve at the end of World War II. Educated at Columbia University (where he restricted himself to Russian, German, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit and Polish), Urdang was a linguistics lecturer at New York University from 1956 to 1961.  Although he never wrote the dissertation that would have completed his graduate degree, the Random House Dictionary filled the void amply: \"He always said he considered the Random House dictionary his dissertation,\" said Nicole Urdang. Urdang made his debut in the publishing industry as an associate editor in the dictionary department at Funk & Wagnalls and developed a vast vocabulary.  Not averse to making fun of his profession, he wrote in the introduction to Misunderstood, Misused, & Mispronounced Words: This is not a succedaneum for satisfying the nympholepsy of nullifidians. Rather it is hoped that the haecceity of this enchiridion of arcane and recondite sesquipedalian items will appeal to the oniomania of an eximious Gemeinschaft whose legerity and sophrosyne, whose Sprachgef\u00fchl and orexis will find more than fugacious fulfillment among its felicific pages. He died on August 21, 2008, of congestive heart failure in Branford, Connecticut."

They became known as the \"Flying Blue Brothers\" and received extensive attention in the U.S. media, making the cover of LIFE magazine on 8 April 1957. The next year, the brothers started a banana and cacao plantation in Nicaragua in partnership with the family of former President Anastasio Somoza. In 1961, during a flight from Nicaragua, he was forced to land in Havana, Cuba and was jailed for 12 days, just prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion."

The postal service would deliver to his store letters addressed simply to \"Mr. Typewriter, New York\". His customers included many notable authors and reporters, many of whom had clung to their manual typewriters long after personal computers became standard. Tytell was born on December 20, 1913, to Russian Jewish immigrant parents, and grew up in Manhattan's Lower East Side.and in Brooklyn.  He became interested in typewriters at age 15 after disassembling an Underwood 5 typewriter on his gym teacher's desk at Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn and watching it being repaired. He had obtained a contract to maintain typewriters for Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital before graduating from high school. He received his bachelor's from St. John's University in Manhattan  and earned an MBA from New York University, attending college primarily at night. Tytell met his wife, Pearl, in 1938, at her office in the Flatiron building. He had gone there to sign a typewriter rental and repair contract.

In 1941, Tytell created a patented process that allowed him to sell Remington and Underwood Noiseless typewriters that listed for as much as $135 and offer them for sale for $24.95 with a one-year guarantee, and aimed to sell 500 of these typewriters each week. That same year, Tytell developed a coin-operated typewriter that would be available for use in hotel lobbies and train stations for 10 cents per half-hour, modeled on a similar device used in Sweden. Tytell enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during World War II, and also served in the United States Army with the rank of Sergeant, but was kept out of action due to his flat feet and knowledge of typewriters. In the military he created foreign language typewriters, including French language typewriters for paratroopers who were air-dropped as part of the Invasion of Normandy. He was in the typewriter repair business for some 70 years, most of which was spent in his Tytell Typewriter Company, located on the second-floor store at 116 Fulton Street from 1963 until 2000. In The Village Voice, he advertised that he offered \"Psychoanalysis for Your Typewriter.\" He worked in a white lab coat, creating custom keyboards for typewriters in 142 different languages and dialects and had 2 million typefaces in stock. He created typewriters that could print hieroglyphics or musical notes and invented models with carriages that operated in reverse for languages such as Arabic and Hebrew that are written right-to-left. An erroneously inverted character he placed on a Burmese language typewriter became the standard in Burma. Customers included David Brinkley, Dorothy Parker and Andy Rooney, as well as both Dwight D. Eisenhower and Adlai E. Stevenson. In 1980, when David Brinkley needed a Great Primer discontinued by Royal a decade earlier, he was able to find two at Tytell. \"How many do you want?\" was Tytell's response after Brinkley called. Brinkley bought two, what he described as a lifetime supply."

Hiss's lawyers then hired Tytell to create a typewriter that would be indistinguishable from the one the Hiss's owned. Tytell spent two years creating a facsimile Woodstock typewriter whose print characteristics would match the peculiarities of the Hiss typewriter, which was used as one of the primary justifications for an unsuccessful appeal of the verdict in the case. The senior Tytell retired from the typewriter business in 2000, and his son closed the repair shop in 2001, expanding the 116 Fulton Street space, originally used by both Martin and Pearl Tytell for the forensic study of questioned documents, into his own forensic document research business. Tytell's son Peter (13 August 1945 - 11 August 2020) was a forensic document examiner, a practice that mother, father and son developed to resolve disputes over the authenticity of handwritten documents, such as forged signatures on checks or wills, and trace anonymous letters and documents, such as typed wills, to their source, using the unique \"fingerprint\" of each particular typewriter. Peter testified for the prosecution to help gain a conviction in a case that involved documents that were said to connect President John F. Kennedy to Marilyn Monroe and mobster Sam Giancana, and made use of typewriters owned by the Tytell's repair store. His son's expertise was utilized in the investigation of the Killian documents controversy, which involved six documents critical of President George W. Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard and the use of four of these documents which were presented as authentic in a 60 Minutes Wednesday broadcast aired by CBS on September 8, 2004.

I participated in a comprehensive review of DoD's black programs and spent over a decade conducting oversight of the national foreign intelligence program, an almost totally separate world of secrets. I visited Area 51 and other military, intelligence and research facilities. During all those years, I never detected the faintest hint of government interest or involvement in UFOs. ... While a few new, previously overlooked documents might turn up (the bureaucracy is never perfect), I do not believe they would resolve the UFO issue or provide significant new insights. I can think of one lengthy UFO report that is classified only due to concerns over sources and methods. In fact, it identified a convincing conventional explanation for the pilot sightings in this particular case. There are lots of classified documents related to activities at Area 51, where high security is needed. But this is all legitimate stuff the American people would support. They have nothing to do with UFOs, to the best of my knowledge.Mellon worked with Leslie Kean in a UFO organization and is a shareholder and former advisor for the former Blink 182 punk rocker Tom DeLonge's To The Stars Academy of Arts & Sciences. According to the company\u2019s website, Mellon's title was \"national security affairs advisor\". Mellon assisted in production and works with former Pentagon Director of AATIP, Luis Elizondo as a cast member for the cable television network History that distributes the shows series Unidentified: Inside America's UFO Investigation. Mellon was featured in the 2020 UFO documentary The Phenomenon, directed by longtime UFO enthusiast James Fox.

        "content": "In 1997 he converted a Truck, a mobile British Telecom workshop, into a mobile studio, facilitating the artist to work on large-scale paintings and drawings in the landscape, but protected from the elements. He began to gain critical recognition in the early 2000s exhibiting work that tackled the traditionally conservative tradition of Irish Landscape painting through his particular approach of encounter painting to portray land and nature in the rural West of Ireland. The Mobile Studio enabled a highly productive 15-year period work that explored Landscape through the interface of the artist with both culture and nature. The \"Truckscapes\" were distinguished by the inclusion of the doorway of the truck, itself covered in splattered paint, as a painted meeting with nature defined by the artist and the reality of the 'truck-view'. Examples such as \"From Cogan's Shed\" (2004) can be found in collections of the National Gallery of Ireland, \"From Cogan's Shed\" (2007) Limerick City Gallery of Art, and \"Whitethorn, truck-view\" (2000-2001) The Irish Museum of Modern Art. Portraiture, and the formal meeting with his subject is a central tenet of Miller's practice influencing his approach to all genres of painting. For the artist, the artwork is the remains of a lived and painted encounter. In a seminal series of large scale CLOSER drawings made from 1996-2000 and shown in Dublin and London Miller drew his subjects, mostly close family and friends to make unconventional portraits including Corban (1996), Collection of IMMA, of the Irish artist Corban Walker. These drawings were made at very close quarters, exploring a single point perspective, face to face and straddling the subjects on the paper they were being drawn on the floor. Amongst subjects, both well known and unknown, Miller has painted the author John McGahern (1998) The Niland Collection Sligo, and a full seated figure Portrait of John Hogan (2004), a farmer and neighbour of the artist for 16 years, during a period living on Lough Arrow, Co Sligo.  The painting is now in the collection of the Hugh Lane Gallery, Dublin City Gallery, Dublin City Gallery. In 2014 he received the inaugural Hennessy Portrait Prize, held at the National Gallery of Ireland. The award included a commission to paint the Irish musician Donal Lunny for the National Portrait Collection, and was given for his 2013 painting \"Last sitting: Portrait of Barrie Cooke\", a fellow artist, and friend of Miller's who died in 2014. Both paintings are in the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland. In 2014 he was invited by the Irish Museum of Modern Art to respond to the donated studio contents of the renowned Irish portrait and still life painter Edward McGuire (painter) (1932\u20131986), now in the museum's collection. Miller took up residency in the Museum, spending time with McGuire's work studio contents and personal belongings. During the residency he made a series of  still life paintings of objects and the many stuffed birds that Mcguire was renowned for painting. McGuire had died not long after Miller settled in Dublin, in 1986. As a way to connect to the man, he had not met, but whose work Miller admired, he invited a number of McGuires sitters to come and sit for him in IMMA and talk about Edward, often over 30 years later. These included Theresa Browne, Garech Browne, Wanda Ryan, and the poets Anthony Cronin and Paul Durcan. The resulting exhibition at the museum: Nick Miller and the Studio of Edward McGuire (November 2016 -May 2016) featured both artists' works on similar subjects, and an installation of McGuire's studio belongings with a film made by Miller about McGuire's renowned \"Colour Dictionary\" In the same way that Miller attempts to reinvigorate traditions around landscape and portraiture, he continues to evolve the genre of the 'still life', often merging still life with portraiture. In more recent years, since 2011 he began to return to painting elements of nature, flowers, weeds, branches and even seaweed, placed in a variety of vases. Initially painted on a domestic scale, this series of works are known as Vessels: Nature Morte. Jackie Wullschl\u00e4ger describes the paintings: \"Still life is always about holding time, but Miller's swiftly executed paintings also convey growth to decay, almost surreally speeded up: flowers bloom, glisten, wilt within each rapid painterly performance.\"  They were painted over a number of years as a way to hold a connection to his dying mother. In the more the recent    Rootless paintings  Miller works with experiences of disintegration and order, as he takes the still lives to a monumental scale, affirming the primacy of 'Nature' as a true and vital reality."

Miner was born on August 14, 1936, in the Manhattan section of New York. Her father was a professor of history at Columbia University. Miner earned a bachelor's degree from Smith College in 1958, a law degree from Columbia Law School in 1961 and a degree in urban planning from Columbia University in 1972. She married James Edward O'Driscoll, a lecturer in the American language program at Columbia on June 25, 1970; The marriage lasted until his death in 1993. In 1973, Miner was named as counsel to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Her work helped create the legal process for the 1983 landmark status designation of the 17th-century street plan of Lower Manhattan as part of a historic district. This plan helped prevent developers from restructuring the irregular blocks in the area's grid structure. Miner played a major role in presenting the city's case in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City (1978), in which the Supreme Court of the United States upheld (by a 6-3 margin) the ability of New York City to restrict development of Grand Central Terminal based on the building's landmark designation. The Penn Central company had argued that the development restrictions placed on the site constituted an unconstitutional taking of its property by the government in conflict with the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In 1994, new Landmarks Preservation Commission chair Jennifer Raab announced that Miner would be leaving as chief counsel at the end of October 1998, citing the need for a \"fresh eye\". Raab acknowledged Miner's \"very large and important role\" and affirmed that  it was Miner \"who helped establish the legal right to designate landmarks.\" After leaving the Landmarks Preservation Commission, Miner accepted a position at Pace University School of Law and as an adjunct associate professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. She lived in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, and died at age 72 of complications of lung disease."

        "content": "Fox was widely known for her interdisciplinary and cross-cultural fieldwork. In 1959, Fox began research in Belgium. She conducted ethnographic research there nearly every summer for forty years. To start she was interested in researching Belgians because they often return to Belgium after attending medical school in the United States. Eventually, her focal point became researching Belgium through the lens of their medical system. In 1978 Fox published \u201cWhy Belgium\u201d to explain her area and location of research. In this essay, she described Belgium as particularistic due to society being divided into distinct groups \u2013 by social class, religion, political affiliation, language, and region. Fox noted this particularism creates labels that effect Belgian\u2019s education and research opportunities as well as medical access. From a functionalist perspective, Fox viewed Belgium to be divided into these various groups yet functioning through pluralism due to the wide acceptance of \u2018separate but equal.\u2019 Fox also observed Belgians to be energized and united due to their Catholic-equivalent of the Protestant work ethic. There have been disputes over Belgium\u2019s existence, and Fox wrote in \u201cWhy Belgium\u201d that she observed distinct culture in Belgium and believed Belgium indeed exists. Her discovery that there is a common culture throughout Belgium has been disputed by Belgians due to Belgium\u2019s particularism. To develop a deeper understanding of the Belgian society, Fox travelled to Belgium\u2019s former colony, Zaire, which today is the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Central Africa."

However, the Russian staff in the office were helpful in the regard that they had vast amounts of cultural capital and knowledge about Russian lifestyles at the time. In 1992, the main project generated in Russia combated the rising homeless population in Moscow by offering medical consultants, preventative and curative health care, and social consultants. The end goal of the project was to hopefully de-stigmatize how the homeless were seen by the general public and to transfer the program to municipal authorities and the Department of Health in Moscow. MSF-B also coordinated two other programs in Siberia and Chechnya and were dubbed the \"Siberia Project\" and the \"Caucasus Project\", respectively. In 1995, MSF-B moved their attention to prison colonies in Siberia after an appeal was made to have MSF facilitate the treatment of TB in those colonies. When the MSF staff reached the colony, they replenished the community with construction materials, soap, and clothes. Afterward, the medical program was put in motion, providing prisoners with TB screening and anti-TB medication, sanitary conditions, and training for prison medical staff to adopt a protocol to carry out effective treatment and analysis of any future epidemics. MSF-B also tried persuading the Kemerovo government and the Ministry of Justice to adopt the TB control strategy that the World Health Organization (WHO) uses, DOTS. The \"Siberia Project\" was spread to aid in the treatment of non-prisoners in Mariinsk. The third program that MSF-B facilitated was based in Chechnya and Dagestan. Both territories were subject to the First Chechen Campaign (1994-1996) and Second Chechen Campaign (1999-2000). The area affected by both wars still are under influence of insurgent activity and has led to the displacement of Chechens. The \"Caucasus Project\" aimed to provide medical assistance and psychosocial care, food, and shelter to thousands of civilians in Chechnya and Ingushetia."

Once there, her research was narrowed down to the work carried out in the Khayelitsha community, where the HIV/AIDS pandemic was concentrated. The MSF program in Khayelitsha aimed to integrate a regimen of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to eventually have the community have maximized access to treatment through a primary care infrastructure. Additionally, it geared toward breaking down the stigma associated with having the disease by building up \"treatment literacy\" and community education to lower the transmission. Because the pandemic scale of HIV/AIDS requires long-term surveillance of communities such as Khayelitsha, Fox had the opportunity to make many successive trips to Cape Town, where she observed the evolution of the program. Two macro-issues became apparent while observing the operation of the program: \"patient selection\" (the endeavor to maximize the treatment and medicines available to as many people with HIV/AIDS) and the struggle to have the government implement a national HIV/AIDS prevention program."

Based on fieldwork in a variety of medical settings in the United States, Belgium, and Zaire, her ethnographic work examined chronic and terminal illness, medical research, therapeutic innovation, medical education and socialization, and bio-ethics. Her work not only considered medical practice but also medical research, patient experiences and the nature of uncertainty for patients and healers. Out of this work grew her interests in medical education as well as medical ethics, a field she engaged some years before there was such a thing as Bioethics. Fox argued that bioethicists should be trained in the social sciences before being trained in bioethics. In an abstract of a collection of her essays, the author writes that \u201cDr. Fox has explored basic cultural phenomena and questions associated with health, illness, and medicine: values, beliefs, symbols, rites, and the nuances of language: ethical and existential dilemmas and dualities; and the complex interrelationships between medicine, science, religion, and magic. She draws systematically and imaginatively upon anthropological, psychological, historical, and biological insights and integrates observations and analyses from her own studies in American, Western European, and Central African societies.\u201d Fox went on to combine ethnography with history in her study of the development of the Congolese medical profession (1968). During the years of 1962-1967 she made five trips to Congo-L\u00e9opoldville. The Republic of Congo was a newly independent country when she was visiting. She studied religion, rebellions, and politics in the Congo. They were gaining their first Congolese physicians and developing medical practices and ethics. Her studies were centered on how the outside factors influenced medical practices."

Following in her parents' footsteps, she also completed a doctorate at the University of Michigan, in mycology. Smith was president of the Mycological Society of America, and from 1945 to 1950 served as editor of the scientific journal Mycologia in 1950. He was president of the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters, the Michigan Academy (1966\u201367), the Michigan Botanical Club, the Torrey Botanical Club, and the Research Club of the University of Michigan in 1974\u201375.

It is next to impossible to avoid bias in taxonomic work, but information should be \"slanted\" as little as possible. Other contemporary authors that did not meet these standards would often suffer censure by Smith in book reviews or articles. For example, in a book review about a then-recent publication on wood-decay fungi, he wrote: In a work of this type the author should have recognized his duty to give his readers and users the best of modern classifications and nomenclature. In this respect he failed completely. ...The agaric part of the work is full of contradictions based on the author's failure to consider work of the last 30 years.\" Later he writes Perhaps the best that can be said for the work editorially is that fortunately there is very little introductory material to confuse the reader.\" In another article, commenting about \"the current low degree of accuracy developing in the literature on hallucinogenic mushrooms generally\", Smith pointed out numerous errors in two current publications, such as ambiguously written text, mistakes in citations, lack of scientific rigor in presenting arguments, unreliability of data due to inadequate sampling procedures, and inadequate searches of available literature. Smith would soon collaborate with one of these authors in a publication the next year."

Playing Indian won the 1999 Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award from the Gustavus Myers Program for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights in North America. Deloria's second book, Indians in Unexpected Places (2004), explores stereotypes of Native American people which confine them to the past and analyzes the seeming disunity between Indian people and modernity.  Indians in Unexpected Places received the John C. Ewers Prize for Ethnohistorical Writing in 2006 from the Western History Association.

He and his twin brother, Robert H. Hume, became famous in 1944 and 1945 as the \u201cdead heat twins\u201d due to their practice of finishing their races hand-in-hand in an intentional effort to finish each race tied for the win.  During the 1944 track season, the Hume twins tied for the win in nine straight mile races, including the Big Ten Conference and NCAA championships.  They were co-winners in every mile event they entered in 1944 except one.  The exception occurred at a dual meet in which \"a meticulous official ruled that one of the Humes beat the other across the finish line by a couple of inches although they were hand in hand at the wire.\"  Their best time in a \u201cdead heat\u201d mile with hands clasped was 4:14.6 at the Central Collegiate Conference meet in 1944; the time broke a school record of 4:16.4 that had been set by H.L. Carroll 28 years earlier in 1916. The Hume twins were raised in Canonsburg, a small town in Pennsylvania\u2019s soft coal region, not far from Pittsburgh.  Robert Hume set the school record for the mile, and Ross set the record in the half mile.   After graduating from Canonsburg High School, the Hume twins enrolled at the University of Michigan to run track under Coach Ken Doherty.  One sports columnist in 1945 noted that the Humes were \u201ctwins in every possible manner, facial resemblance, running style, the clothes they wear, and the courses they are taking.\u201d In his track career at Michigan, Ross Hume won three NCAA championships and six Big Ten Conference championships.  He won the 1944 NCAA outdoor mile run in a dead heat with his brother.  And in 1945, he won NCAA individual championships in both the outdoor mile run and the outdoor 880-yard run.  He won six Big Ten championships from 1943-1946.  His  Big Ten championships included the indoor and outdoor mile runs in 1944 and 1945, all four of which were shared \u201cdead heat\u201d wins with his brother.  He also won Big Ten championships in the two-mile run in the 1944 outdoor and 1945 indoor conference championship meets.   Ross was named an NCAA All-American three times and was selected as the captain of Michigan\u2019s track team in 1945. The Hume twins\u2019 practice of interlocking hands in \u201cdead heat\u201d wins drew national publicity and also controversy.  Associated Press columnist Jimmy Jordan dubbed them the \u201cdead heat twins.\u201d  Another writer referred to them as the \u201cDead Heat Kids.\u201d  The publicity peaked in June 1944 when \u201cMichigan's famous distance running twins raced to their ninth straight dead-heat victory in the mile run of the 23rd National Collegiate Athletic Association track and field championship meet tonight, finishing hand-in-hand more than 100 yards ahead of the next runner.\u201d  A columnist in Massachusetts wrote: \u201dAs the twins finished their sophomore year at Michigan, [Coach Ken] Doherty decided to run them in the mile and two mile races together \u2026 this proved to be a happy solution \u2026 the twins like to run together .. they\u2019ve been doing that since before their school days .. furthermore, they usually finish so far in front that the last 50 yards finds that they are clasping hands and hit the tape together.\u201d United Press columnist Bob Meyer noted that they \u201cdeliberately have finished in a dead heat for first place in every mile except one in which both were entered this year,\u201d and suggested that the twins \u201cpossibly may forget their sentimental trick of locking hands for a dead-heat finish in order to defeat a tough field and slice another second or 2 off their CCC time.\u201d As a result of the Humes\u2019 practice, the NCAA passed a rule in 1946 stating that athletes would no longer be able to tie in any track meets. After graduating from Michigan, Ross Hume became an orthopedic surgeon.  His brother Robert became a general surgeon.  The brothers were inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1990.  Robert died in 1999, and Ross followed in 2000."

He joined the Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia (PPSD) in 1890.  Marek was a chief editor of the newspaper \u2018'Wi\u0119zien polityczny (Political prisoner) and Naprz\u00f3d'' (Forward) during World War I.  In 1919, after Poland regained independence after years of partitions, he joined the united Polish Socialist Party (PPS). Elected Sejm member the same year, he became chairman of the PPS caucus, replacing Norbert Barlicki in 1926. On May 31, 1926 he nominated J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski for President. Pi\u0142sudski was elected by National Assembly for this post, but decided against taking office. As a result PPS drafted their own candidate in next election, held on June 1, and Marek became a nominee. He faced Pi\u0142sudski-backed chemistry professor Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki and Pozna\u0144 Voivode Adolf Bni\u0144ski, who represented the right wing. In the first round he placed last with 56 votes (against 215 for Mo\u015bcicki and 211 for Bni\u0144ski). In the runoff he finished last again, with just one vote (Mo\u015bcicki defeated Bni\u0144ski 281 to 200). Marek served as a Sejm Vice-Marshal from 1928 to 1931.

The Conservation of Human Resources Project became the fulfillment of that vision in 1950 when adequate funds were raised to get the study off of the ground..\" Having helped in the initiation of the project, Eisenhower secured Ginzberg's position as director of the project and placed Howard M. Snyder on the project's staff as an advisor prior to his departure from Columbia. Snyder came to replace Eisenhower as the chief fundraiser for the CHR project in the years that followed.

Hardy Cross Dillard was also cousin of civil engineer Hardy Cross \u2013 originator of the Hardy Cross method. Dillard attended the Virginia Episcopal School and later the U.S. Military Academy  where he graduated in 1924. Upon graduation, Dillard was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Infantry. However, with the First World War fading in to the background, fresh West Point graduates were encouraged to leave the service. Thus, like many of his classmates, Dillard resigned his commission two months after graduation. He subsequently entered the University of Virginia Law School and served on the editorial board of the Virginia Law Review and was also president of the law school student body. Due to his legal ability, the law faculty took the unusual step of asking him to stay after graduation to serve as an instructor. He taught primarily international law for two years before leaving to become an associate in the New York City law firm of Gregg & Church. After only a year with the law firm,  he was awarded a fellowship by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to study international law at the University of Paris. Upon completion of the program, Dillard accepted an appointment as assistant professor of law at the University of Virginia. He returned to New York City in the summers of 1932 and 1933 and worked as an associate at Davis, Polk, Wardwell, Gardiner and Reed. In 1934 he became the university's director of Institute of Public Affairs \u2013 an assignment in addition to his law duties. The institute brought prominent speakers to the university from government, business and academia to discuss topics of national and international interest. As the director, Dillard became acquainted with some of the leading figures of the day such as Senator Robert A. Taft, Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, Ambassador Paul V McNutt, Owen Lattimore, Thurman Arnold, Max Lerner, David Sarnoff, Rexford Guy Tugwell, Major George Fielding Eliot, Max Eastman, Quincy Howe, and William L. Shirer. Dillard, however, drew controversy by inviting communists such as Earl Browder to speak. A former president of the university's Alumni Association protested in a letter to the Alumni News that Dillard went \"beyond freedom of speech\" when he offered a rostrum from which the general secretary of the American Communist Party and the Soviet Ambassador could, \"spread subversive doctrines.\" Dillard responded that where controversial topics are selected, \"both sides should be fairly heard.\" A spokesman for Germany was also invited to speak."

During his tenure on the Court, Dillard adjudicated seven contentious and three advisory cases.  According to his peers, Judge Dillard's ICJ decision's were resolute and consistent with jurisprudence depicted in writings during his years as a legal scholar. Dillard's international jurisprudence espoused an interlocking of law and diplomacy whereby law serves as an \"ordering device\" which helps in dispute settlement and at the same time leaves room for the parties to play a major role in the final determination. He believed that international law should be realistic, creative, axiologically oriented and also serve as an indicator of emerging norms. Judge Dillard also stressed that the leaders of national governments \u2013 described by him as the \"wielders of power\" \u2013 must understand that effective international law is,\"essential to the long range national interests of all the components of the international community.\"  Judge Dillard's multi method jurisprudence is reflected in an adage he often used and first noticed on a sign outside of a Unitarian Church in London during the Second World War \u2013 between dogmatism on one hand and skepticism on the other, there is a middle way, which is our way - open minded certainty."

She attended the school of music in Baku (class of Stephan Strasser), the piano department of the Leningrad Conservatory (1933\u20131937), and the conductors' department of the Moscow Conservatory (1939\u20131947). For thirteen years, from 1947 until 1960, Dudarova was a junior conductor at the Moscow State Symphony Orchestra; in 1960, she took over as the principal conductor and led the orchestra until 1989. She led the Symphony Orchestra of Russia from 1991 to 2003 and retained the role of artistic manager of the orchestra until her death in Moscow in January 2009. In 1977, she was awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR.

        "content": "Jonathan Greenleaf Eveleth (May 8, 1821 \u2013 December 10, 1861) founded the first oil company in America with George Bissell in 1854.  Partners in the Wall Street law firm of Eveleth & Bissell, the two formed the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company with 5 other investors from New York, New Haven, and Titusville, Pennsylvania, to \"raise, procure, manufacture, and sell Rock Oil.\" Eveleth was born in New Gloucester, Maine, on May 8, 1821, to James and Hannah Austin Eveleth.  His father was a leather tanner and boot and shoe maker and a descendant of early colonial families of Massachusetts. He was a direct descendant of Joseph Eveleth, juror in the Salem Witch trial of John Proctor, and a second cousin of Theophilus Parsons, Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. Eveleth married Mary Weeks of Bath, Maine, in 1852. He graduated from Bowdoin College in 1847 and Harvard Law School in 1854.  He was Principal of the Liberal Institute (1848\u20131849) a college preparatory school in Norway, Maine, and then, following law school, joined Fessenden & Deblois, the Portland, Maine law firm of U.S. Representative Thomas Fessenden's family.  He later formed his own firm with Bissell in New York at 14 Wall St. His New York practice was eventually closed in 1859 to allow the partners to fully pursue their oil business venture. Bissell and Eveleth initially invested $5,000 to purchase and lease over  of what they believed were the principal oil fields in Titusville, PA.  The company collected oil in trenches and sold small quantities at high prices ($1.50 per gallon) primarily for medicinal purposes. Believing in the mineral's greater economic potential and in order to gain the interest of additional investors, the two partners engaged at their own expense renowned Yale chemist, Benjamin Silliman, Jr., to investigate crude oil samples from the Pennsylvania site for its properties and commercial usefulness.  Silliman submitted in 1855 his historic report to \"Messrs. Eveleth, Bissell, and Reed\" concluding, \"gentlemen ... there is much ground for encouragement in the belief that your Company have in their possession a raw material from which they may manufacture... very valuable products\", thus marking a major scientific milestone for the university as well the birth of the American petroleum industry.  The company was then reorganized to include additional New Haven investors, and Silliman was appointed president, with Eveleth and Bissell maintaining controlling interest. Pennsylvania Rock Oil later leased its property to Seneca Oil, which under the management of Edwin Drake, drilled the first oil well in the United States and became the first to strike oil in 1859.  Bissell continued to considerably expand his and the New York investors' land in the Titusville region, in Franklin and Petroleum Center, PA. However, Eveleth's life was cut short only 2 years later due to illness.   Bissell went on to become known as \"the father of the American oil industry\". Eveleth was described as \"sage, cautious, and tenacious\" and the \"principal promoter\" of the company who made many of the major decisions. He died in New York City on December 10, 1861, after suffering from nephritis. His son and only child, Charles W. Eveleth, died in Germany while a student at Ober Gymnasium."

As a sophomore in 1919, he was a starter for the Notre Dame football team coached by the legendary Knute Rockne.  He played end for the undefeated 1919 Fighting Irish team that also featured another Michiganian, George Gipp. The passing combination of Gipp at left halfback to Kirk at left end became one of Notre Dame's greatest offensive weapons in 1919.  In October 1919, The Fort Wayne News and Sentinel praised \"the ability of Kirk in receiving passes and breaking away for long runs.\"  In early November 1919, Kirk drew attention for his work in Notre Dame's win over Indiana.  The Indianapolis Star praised the team's end play The Irish wing men are wonderful performers.  Either Kirk or Anderson can snag the ball out of the air on forward passes with great skill.  Both are fast and wonderful defensive men.  It was seldom in Saturday's game that either was boxed.  They broke up what little interference Indiana displayed and got through to their man time after time. In late November, Notre Dame defeated Purdue 33-13, and the Indiana Star reported that the Boilermakers would have finished on top had it not been for the passing attack of Gipp and Kirk.  Kirk scored two touchdowns against Purdue, and the Star noted: \"Some of the passes completed by Gipp and Kirk were of the sensational order.  Two touchdowns resulted from passes, Gipp to Kirk ...\" At the end of the 1919 season, the Indianapolis Sunday Star named Gipp and Kirk to its All-Indiana team, two of the four Notre Dame players to be so honored in 1919.  The Star wrote of Kirk In every game the Irish have competed in this season, Kirk has been a star.  His uncanny ability to camp under forward passes gives him a call on the eleven.  Not only that, but he was down the field fast under punts and played a great defensive game. Kirk was also selected by critics for the All-Western team in 1919."

While Gipp returned to South Bend, Kirk transferred to the University of Michigan. Rockne later recalled that Kirk and Gipp had been \"practically inseparable\" and reflected on his disappointment in losing the talented Kirk.  Rockne said of Kirk He was the apple of my eye.  Kirk played with Notre Dame a couple of seasons before he entered Michigan and not one was more sorry to see him go to the Wolverines than I was.  He played with Notre Dame when Gipp was at his best and the forward pass combination from Gipp to Kirk could not be beaten on any team. Kirk starred on Michigan's freshman team in 1920, but was ineligible to play on Michigan's varsity team in his first year after transferring."

At the start of the third quarter, Kirk ran a kickoff back 80 yards for a touchdown.  Syndicated columnist Billy Evans wrote that Kirk's 80-yard run \"through the entire Illinois team\" was \"the most spectacular play performed by a Michigan player this year,\" and \"one of the most brilliant feats of the year.\"  Kirk also recovered a fumbled punt in the second quarter at the Illinois 18-yard-line that led to another Michigan touchdown.  Columnist Evans wrote that Kirk was \"directly and indirectly responsible\" for all 24 points scored by Michigan against Illinois.  After the Illinois game, Kirk reportedly left the stadium before the crowd and spent several hours hunting in the woods outside of Ann Arbor. Another columnist, writing under the name \"Roundy,\" wrote that Kirk gave him \"an eye full,\" turning plays \"so fast that the thing is looked up in the stands as a joke.\"  Roundy continued in his praise of Kirk as follows As soon as Kirk grabs a pass he becomes a halfback with his speed and trick running.  His run on the kickoff through the whole Illinois team proved that, for an end, he is all over the field and has a nose for fumbles, is strong and tricky.  There is no such thing as boxing this bird. Kirk, and his tackling of receivers of punts is a beautiful thing to see.  So the ends are the strongest spot on the team.  These two birds can play on my team any time, any place, anywhere, and at any price."

        "content": "At the end of the 1922 season, Kirk was selected as a first-team end on several All-Western and All-American teams.  Harold Johnson of the Chicago American wrote that Kirk \"stands out\" among the ends Virtually every coach, critic and student of the pastime is agreed upon the choice of Bernie Kirk, left end of the undefeated Michigan machine.  Yost's star was good in every respect that a flanker could be.  Not only was he one of the most deadly tacklers in the circuit, but he was shifty and fleet in streaking down the field to nail the receivers of forward passes or punts.  He shone, too, at stopping end plays directed at him and was without a superior at spearing aerial shots from his comrades. The Capital Times from Wisconsin picked Kirk as the best end in the west and noted, \"The Wolverine flank protected by Kirk is one of the strongest in the country.  Little has been gained around him, while on the offense his backs have had plenty of success -- thanks to Kirk who helps pave the way.\" The Iowa City Press-Citizen wrote that Kirk \"seems to stand out by himself\" among the ends, noting that he \"attracted most attention for his receiving of passes and his deadly spilling of interference.\" Billy Evans picked Kirk for his 1922 \"National Honor Roll,\" and credited Kirk's performance to physical conditioningBernie Kirk of Michigan was the leading end of the west this year. ...  Condition made Kirk a star.  He lacked condition in 1921.  At that time he was just  as able, otherwise as this year.  But nobody mentioned him and he did nothing much to help his team.  Kirk realized why he failed in 1921 and immediately began preparing for the season of 1922.  Careful diet, regular hours and well-planned exercise brought him into remarkable condition.  Kirk was fit when the training season started.  Kirk played every minute of every game he started this year.  He never had time taken out.  He was really a physical marvel, considering how hard he played. Kirk was acclaimed as a first-team All-American at the end position by the New York Tribune and by noted sports writers, including Walter Eckersall of the Chicago Tribune and Fred Hayner of the Chicago Daily News.  When the dean of football critics, Walter Camp, named Kirk to his second team and selected little known end Taylor of Navy to his first team, charges of Eastern bias were leveled at Camp.  An Illinois newspaper wrote the following about Camp's omission of Kirk The fact that eastern football did not demonstrate any great superiority over the other sections of the country is not going to help justify the selection of seven eastern men.  The failure of Kirk to win a place will come as a great surprise.  Kirk is one of the best ends the 'Big Ten' has produced in years.  It was felt certain that he would be selected.  Most of the critics picked Kirk and Muller as the ends.  Camp gives Taylor of Annapolis the preference over Kirk. One Ohio columnist wrote that his paper printed Camp's All-American selections \"with apologies\" and called Camp's favoritism of eastern players \"a positive travesty.\"  None of the other major All-American selectors chose Taylor as a first-team All-American, and one California newspaper referred to Kirk as one of the greatest ends ever turned out in the Middle WestKirk's remarkable showing with Michigan this season stamped him as one of the greatest ends ever turned out in the Middle West.  He was named by a majority of sports writers throughout the country as All-America end.  Walter Camp, however, placed Taylor of the Navy at end instead of Kirk, on his first team.  Kirk was placed on the second team. Billy Evans echoed the same sentimentKirk was unquestionably the best end the west, if not the country, has produced in years.  As a defensive player, he was without a peer.  He also was very proficient in handling the forward pass.  Kirk starred in every game that Michigan played during the 1922 season.  No one player meant more to the success of Yost's great eleven than Kirk.  Every critic in the west selected Kirk on either the 'Big Ten' or middle west all-star teams.  A great majority of the critics of the country placed him on their All-American elevens."

        "content": "In the early morning hours of Sunday, December 17, 1922, Kirk sustained a fractured skull and internal injuries in an automobile accident.  Kirk and four others were returning to Ann Arbor after a night in Detroit when the car in which Kirk was a passenger slid off the icy road and crashed into a telephone pole.  The other four members of the party, including fellow Michigan football player Eddie Usher, were either uninjured or sustained only minor injuries.  Kirk was taken to Beyer Memorial Hospital in Ypsilanti unconscious and in critical condition. Over the next week, newspapers across the country followed the daily changes in Kirk's condition.  On Sunday evening, Kirk remained unconscious and doctors expressed fear for his recovery.  Early in the week, Kirk's condition was much improved, and Kirk's father reported that physicians had told him that his son would recover.  Doctors also reported that Kirk's right eye had been badly injured, but it was thought that his sight would not be impaired. The press also reported closely on the investigation into the cause of the crash.  Initial reports indicated that the automobile, owned by Harold Covert but being driven by Cyrenus Darling, was speeding on the icy road.  But after an investigation, Ypsilanti Police Chief John F. Connor reported that the accident was \"unavoidable\" and caused by the icy condition of the road.  Chief Connor said the vehicle was not being driven at an unlawful speed, and witnesses told him it was moving at 30 to 35 miles per hour. Kirk suffered what was reported as a \"slight relapse\" on Wednesday.   The United Press reported that Kirk's pulse was down, and doctors expressed fears that meningitis might develop and described his condition as \"not so good.\"  Doctors hoped that Kirk's \"fine physical condition will pull him through,\" and his condition improved again on Thursday. After an up-and-down week, meningitis set in, and Kirk died on Saturday morning, December 23, 1922.  On learning of Kirk's passing, Kirk's teammate Harry Kipke told reporters, \"Bernie Kirk was one of the best liked boys that ever wore a Michigan uniform.  He was one of the greatest ends the University ever had, and he was a real fellow in every respect.\" Hundreds of telegrams of condolence were sent to the family \"from all parts of the world,\" including one from Walter Camp, which readDeepest regrets and sympathy.  We shall not soon forget the remarkable play on the gridiron of Bernard Kirk, a star indeed and one of those indefatigable performers combining both brain and physique with speed and judgment, a fine example of real football players. Many newspapers noted the coincidence that Kirk and George Gipp, former teammates and close friends, had both died even before all of the All-American teams had been announced (Gipp had died in December 1920).  Notre Dame Coach Rockne recalled that Gipp and Kirk had been \"great pals\" and \"practically inseparable.\" A Wisconsin newspaper made the following observation[Kirk] had played end on the Notre Dame eleven before coming to Michigan, and the death of Kirk marks the passing of that ill fated but brilliant Notre Dame combination of Gipp to Kirk.  Like Kirk, George Gipp, died in the height of his stardom, just after the close of a season in which he was picked by most critics for the all-American.  As a member of the Notre Dame team Kirk played end and received most of the passes hurled by Gipp."

Yost, and two U.S. Congressmen. His casket was carried to the grave by eight of his Michigan teammates, including Harry Kipke, Paul G. Goebel, Irwin Uteritz, and Franklin Cappon.  One account described the emotion of the funeral: \"As the casket bearing the body of the former University of Michigan football star was slowly lowered into his last resting place, husky athletes who battled with him on the football fields for the glory and honor of Michigan sobbed unashamed.\" That last resting place is St. John Cemetery in Ypsilanti."

On 20 July 2018, while on the ISS, Gerst took part in a live concert by the German electronic music group Kraftwerk in the German city of Stuttgart. He addressed the audience and played a synthesizer during the performance of the song \"Spacelab\". On 20 December 2018 he and his crewmates Serena Aunon-Chancellor and Sergey Prokopyev returned to Earth and landed in Kazakhstan after 197 days in space, combined with the 165 days in space on his last mission, Gerst has 362 days in space, more than any other ESA astronaut in history. In 2020 Luca Parmitano surpassed this record with 367 days in space."

Although her family owned a small farm, her father worked as a carpenter. This meant that her mother was mainly responsible for caring for the farm. A self-proclaimed \"tom-boy,\" May-Britt was born into a family without excess money, meaning that she did not have the means to travel in the summer. With her free time, she chose to study animals where she found a major passion. May-Britt's mother told her fairytales while she was growing up and always encouraged her to work hard to make her dreams come true. As a child, May-Britt wanted to become a doctor who traveled the world saving people, or even a veterinarian due to her love of animals. She was never a particularly gifted student in grade school, but the right level of encouragement from her teachers saw her talents flourish. May-Britt was determined not to become a housewife, as was customary for the time. May-Britt Moser attended the University of Oslo where she studied psychology, mathematics, and neurobiology. May-Britt chose this school because two of her sisters lived in the Oslo area and provided her with a temporary place to live. She enjoyed the freedom of university, but was not completely sure what she wanted to do with her degree. She was accepted into dentistry school, but declined the offer. May-Britt soon met Edvard I. Moser, who she recognized from her high school.  The couple married on July 27th, 1985 and decided to together study the relationship between the brain and behavior.   In June of 1991, the couple had their first child, Isabel. They found it difficult to balance a PhD program with having a child, but their passion for their studies fueled them to bring their daughter along for long days in the lab. Ailin was born in 1995.  Later that year, May-Britt Moser obtained a doctorate in neurophysiology for her work recognizing correlations between the structure of the hippocampus and spatial recognition within rats.  May-Britt Moser and her husband traveled briefly to the University of Edinburgh to work with Richard Morris, a neuroscientist. They later visited University College London, where they worked in O' Keefe's laboratory. The couple eventually decided to work at Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, where May-Britt became a professor of neuroscience and director of the University's Center for Neural Computation.  The couple announced their divorce in 2016, but still continue their scientific work together."

She was then employed as a research fellow at the Faculty of Medicine, where she was awarded her Ph.D. in Neurophysiology in 1995, under the supervision of professor Per Andersen. She and Edvard Moser went on to undertake postdoctoral training with Richard Morris at the Centre for Neuroscience, University of Edinburgh from 1994 to 1996, and were visiting postdoctoral fellows at the laboratory of John O'Keefe at the University College, London for two months. The Mosers returned to Norway in 1996 where May-Britt was appointed associate professor in biological psychology at the Department of Psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. She was promoted to a position as full professor of neuroscience at NTNU in 2000. The couple were instrumental in the establishment of the Centre for the Biology of Memory (CBM) in 2002 and the Institute for Systems Neuroscience at NTNU in 2007. Moser is also head of department of the NTNU Centre for Neural Computation. She also is a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters, Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters,  the American Philosophical Society, and the Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences. Moser was appointed by the European Research Council as a member of one of the evaluation panels for ERC startup grants for the period 2007\u20132009. The Mosers pioneered research on the brain's mechanism for representing space together with their mentor John O'Keefe. The Mosers discovered types of cells that are important for determining position (spatial representation) close to the hippocampus, an area deep in the brain that is important for encoding of space, and also for episodic memory.  Moser investigated correlations between the anatomical structure of the hippocampus and social learning in rats. Moser's work gave the ability for scientists to gain new knowledge into the cognitive processes and spatial deficits associated with human neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. In 2014, the Mosers shared half of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The other half of the prize was awarded to John O'Keefe. The Mosers were one of five couples to be awarded a Nobel Prize. May-Britt Moser was a co-Founder of the Centre for the Biology of Memory, a Research Council of Norway-funded Centre of Excellence from 2003 to 2012, and has taken on the Directorship of the Centre for Neural Computation, a second Centre of Excellence that will run from 2013 to 2022. In 2013, the Trondheim Chamber of Commerce awarded Moser the Madame Beyer award, which recognizes brilliant female business leaders. It was awarded in recognition of Moser's superb leadership, scientific achievements, and her high ethical standards, as well as her consistent focus on teamwork and community spirit."

        "content": "Sir Thomas Clarke  (1703 \u2013 13 November 1764) was a British judge who served as Master of the Rolls. He was the son of a carpenter and a pawnbroker from St Giles in the Fields, and was educated at Westminster School between 1715 and 1721 thanks to the help of Zachary Pearce. On 10 June 1721 he matriculated to Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA in 1724. He became a fellow of Trinity College in 1727, and a member of Gray's Inn the same year. Clarke was evidently knowledgeable in Roman law, and was mentioned in a poem called the causidicade as a possible Solicitor General in 1742. He became a King's Counsel (KC) in 1740, and in 1742 left Gray's Inn to join Lincoln's Inn, which he became a bencher of in 1754. In 1747 he was elected a Member of Parliament for St Michael's, and in 1754 was returned for Lostwithiel. After the death of the Master of the Rolls, Sir John Strange, Clarke was offered the position. The job was originally offered to William Murray, later Lord Mansfield, but he turned it down. If he had accepted, Clarke might instead have succeeded Murray as Attorney General for England and Wales. Clarke was officially appointed on 25 May 1754, and was knighted at the same time. In June 1754 he was invested as a Privy Councillor (PC). Clarke evidently discharged his duties \"with great credit\" for ten years, until his death in office on 13 November 1764. He was buried in the Rolls Chapel, now the main library of King's College London. Clarke was a close friend of the Earl of Macclesfield, and this friendship combined with his unclear parentage started rumours that Clark was in fact Macclesfield's son. In his will, Clarke left his Flitcroft-designed home, Branch Hill Lodge, to Macclesfield. Outside politics and law, Clarke was a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), and \"devoted himself to philosophical pursuits\"."

He was elected to the mastership in a close contest, and the first for which the Fellows had chosen, the previous Masters having been outside nominees. On 13 September 1643 eleven Fellows met in the college chapel. The candidates were one of them external, Herbert Thorndike of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Minshull who was a Fellow of Sidney. Herbert was a royalist, while Minshull had the backing of Oliver Cromwell, a college contemporary. The matter hung in the balance but was settled by the intervention of the troops of Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester, in command of the Eastern Association covering the area for Parliament since August of that year. Despite the strong-arm tactics employed, Charles I confirmed the appointment and Minshull continued in the post for the rest of his life. He was vice-chancellor of the university in 1652."

He began his academic career at Washington State University where he graduated in psychology in 1987, before moving to Boston College to graduate in social psychology in 1992. Following this, Shortell focused on the relationship between religion and cultural beliefs, comparing the beliefs of Protestants and Catholics in the United States for Smith College in 1995. Shortell first came to public notice two years later when, having moved to Brooklyn College, he became Assistant Professor of Sociology and wrote the article, \"Religious Affiliation, Commitment and Ideology Among US Elites\" in which he continued his first major article from 1995. He then wrote about the influence of religion in El Salvador during the era when \u00d3scar Romero fought against the military junta, before moving onto a series of controversial articles between 2002 and 2004 in which he argued that morality in any form is totally incompatible with religion. Shortell is writing a book about the responses to Darwinism from its origins until today."

To enhance that, in 1914 Grace established Grace National Bank, a New York City private bank that concentrated on business done in South America. The extent of the W.R.

        "content": "William Craft Brumfield (born June 28, 1944) is a contemporary American historian of Russian architecture, a preservationist and an architectural photographer. Brumfield is currently Professor of Slavic studies at Tulane University. Brumfield grew up in the deep American South, where he became interested in Russia by reading Russian novels. After receiving a BA from Tulane University in 1966 and an MA from the University of California, Berkeley in 1968, he arrived in the former Soviet Union for the first time in 1970 as a graduate student starting work in architectural photography, although he did not seriously study the craft of photography until 1974. Brumfield earned a Ph.D in Slavic studies at the University of California, Berkeley in 1973 and held a position of assistant professor at Harvard University in 1974\u20131980. In 1983 Brumfield, formerly a generalist of Slavic studies, established himself in the history of architecture with his first book, Gold in azure: one thousand years of Russian architecture. It was followed by The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture (1991), Russian housing in the modern age: design and social history (1993), A History of Russian Architecture (1993, Notable Book of that year and a best seller according to The New York Times), Lost Russia: Photographing the Ruins of Russian Architecture (1995), Landmarks of Russian Architecture: A Photographic Survey (1997) and Commerce in Russian urban culture: 1861-1914 (English edition 2001, Russian edition 2000). In 1986 Brumfield organized the first exhibit of photographic prints from the Prokudin-Gorsky Collection at the Library of Congress. Since that time Brumfield has been actively engaged in the study of Prokudin-Gorsky's photographs, including several publications for the site \"Russia Beyond the Headlines\". Brumfield lived in the former Soviet Union and Russia for a total of fifteen years, doing postgraduate research with Moscow State University and Saint Petersburg State University, but mostly travelling through the northern country, surveying and photographing the surviving relics of vernacular architecture. In a 2005 interview Brumfield, asked to tell which of those journeys stood out, picked a photo survey of Varzuga, a remote village connected to civilization by 150 kilometers of a sandy clay track. Brumfield donated his collection of around 1,100 photographs of Northern Russian architecture taken in 1999\u20132003 to the Library of Congress. His archives were digitized with assistance of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the University of Washington Library. The basic collection of Brumfield's photographic work is held in the Department of Images Collections at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. The William C. Brumfield Collection consists of 12,500 black-and-white 8\" x 10\" photographic prints, 40,000  negatives and over 89,000 digital files, most of which are in color (nearly 149,000 in total). In 2000 Brumfield was elected a Guggenheim Fellow for Humanities - Russian History. He has been a full member of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences (RAASN) since 2002 and an honorary fellow of the Russian Academy of the Arts since 2006. He currently holds the record for most domes captured in a single photograph. In 2014 the D. S. Likhachev Foundation in St. Petersburg awarded Brumfield the D. S. Likhachev Prize \"for outstanding contributions to the preservation of the historic and cultural heritage of Russia.\" In 2019 Brumfield was awarded the Order of Friendship, \u201cfor the merits in strengthening friendship and cooperation between peoples, fruitful activities for the rapprochement and mutual enrichment of cultures of nations and nationalities.\u201d"

That work led to the design of novel collaboration, messaging and social computing technologies some which have now become standard. He has also researched Personal information management. He co-published a book with Ofer Bergman: The Science of Managing Our Digital Stuff which uses cognitive psychology to understand how we organize and access our personal digital information.

After graduating from Vassar College and Trinity College, Dublin, she began writing advertising copy and fiction. In 1932, McCall published her first novel, The Goldfish Bowl, a satirical comedy loosely based on Anne Morrow and Charles Lindbergh. The film rights were purchased by Warner Bros., but McCall did not get to write the screenplay for the film version, It's Tough to Be Famous (1932) starring Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Instead, Warner Bros. hired McCall on a ten-week contract to write Street of Women (1932). They also tasked her to help with the screenplay of the film Scarlet Dawn (1932), based on her tragic novel of the Russian Revolution, titled Revolt. In 1934, McCall landed a long-term contract with Warner Bros. and became involved with the  Screen Writers Guild. McCall became an associate member of the Guild in 1934 and served her first of six terms on the executive board in 1935. As a member of the negotiating committee, she worked to help secure the Guild's first contract with the studios, and as a member of the executive board, she helped secure an across-the-board wage increase from $40 to $125 per week for writers. In 1942, the first year the contract was signed, McCall was elected the first woman president of the Guild. During her career, McCall wrote for Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Among her screen credits are the 1935 version of A Midsummer Night's Dream, Craig's Wife (1936), The Fighting Sullivans (1944), and Mr. Belvedere Goes to College (1950). She also adapted Wilson Collison's novel Dark Dame into Maisie (1939), launching the successful Maisie series. McCall wrote or co-wrote eight of the ten films in the series. In the 1950s and 1960s, she branched out into television, being credited with four episodes of The Millionaire and one each of Sea Hunt, I Dream of Jeannie, and Gilligan's Island, among others. A number of her stories were published in such magazines as Cosmopolitan, Redbook, Collier's, and The Saturday Evening Post from the 1930s to the 1950s. McCall was one of many who clashed with the conservative Motion Picture Alliance. On July 27, 1954, she had to defend herself in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee against reports that she was a communist sympathizer. She was completely exonerated by the separate California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities of the General Research Committee in its report to the California Senate. Mary C. McCall Jr. died of \"complications of cancer\" at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital, one day shy of her 82nd birthday. She was the first recipient of the Writers Guild's Valentine Davies Award in 1962. In 1985, she also received the Guild's Edmund J. North Award."

His grandfather, James Madison Porter, was one of the college's founders. Porter III served on the civil engineering faculty at Lafayette from 1890 to 1917 and was an early advocate for materials testing. In addition to his academic achievements, Porter designed the Northampton Street Bridge between Easton, Pennsylvania, and Phillipsburg, New Jersey, which is now one of few eyebar cantilever bridges remaining in the U.S. and notable for its high level of ornamentation. Porter also served as consulting engineer to John A. Roebling and Sons on the Riegelsville Bridge further downstream, a wire-rope suspension bridge. Both bridges have national significance for their unique designs and have been documented by the Historic American Engineering Record. Drawings and calculations for these bridges are among Porter's papers collected at the Northampton County Historical and Genealogical Society, the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission archives, and in Special Collections at Lafayette College's Skillman Library."

        "content": "Drummond earned a bachelor's degree in history from Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, California and a Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School. Drummond's first time working with Google was in 1998 as a partner at the technology law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati's corporate transactions group; he was Google's first outside counsel. Drummond worked with Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to raise funding and incorporate the company. Drummond was chief financial officer (CFO) of software company SmartForce from June 1999 until January 2002. In July 2007, Drummond and three other SmartForce executives settled accounting violation charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) resulting from an overstatement of the company's net income by $127 million during a period of time from 1999 to 2002. Drummond paid a $700,000 fine to the SEC; he was also ordered to pay a $125,000 civil fine by the New Hampshire District Court. In February 2002, Drummond joined Google as vice president of corporate development and general counsel. He became Google's senior vice president of corporate development in January 2006 and chief legal officer in December 2006, positions he retained following Google's restructure into Alphabet Inc. in October 2015. He has also been secretary at Google and Alphabet since 2002. During his tenure at Google, Drummond was involved in lawsuits the company fought against GEICO, Viacom, Microsoft and the Association of American Publishers. He played a central role in Google's right to be forgotten dispute in Europe and the company's exit from China in 2010. He also oversaw major acquisitions including YouTube, Android, DoubleClick and Motorola Mobility. Drummond is an advocate for freedom of speech and diversity. Drummond was charged by the SEC in 2005 with causing Google to violate securities law because he failed to advise the company's board that the company was required to register $80 million in stock options used as compensation for employees. The SEC said in its press release, \"By deciding Google could escape its disclosure requirements, and failing to inform the Board of the legal risks of his determination, Drummond caused the company to run afoul of the federal securities laws.\" In January 2005, Google and Drummond settled the complaint by agreeing not to violate securities laws in the future. Neither Google nor Drummond paid a fine or acknowledged wrongdoing. Drummond and other Google executives were defendants in a trial in Italy which began in 2009 over a video of a child being bullied which had been uploaded to Google Video in 2006. None of the executives charged had any involvement with the creation or posting of the video and Google removed the video after being notified by authorities. The case could have had ramifications for content providers around the world. In 2010, Drummond and two other Google executives were found guilty of privacy violations and handed six-month suspended sentences. They were cleared of defamation charges. In December 2012, the convictions and sentences were overturned on appeal. Drummond joined Uber's board of directors in August 2013 after Google Ventures led a $360 million funding round for Uber. Drummond stepped down from the board in August 2016 amid reports he had been shut out of board meetings due to his conflict of interest on self-driving cars. Drummond also sat on the board of Crisis Text Line, a not-for-profit organization, from 2012 to 2018. In 2014, Drummond was appointed a board member at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, where he sat on its conflicts committee. His compensation from Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., was US$47,282,232 in 2018, US$664,252 in 2017, and US$664,387 in 2016. Drummond is an investor and advisor to the media company Ozy. On January 10, 2020, it was announced that Drummond would leave Alphabet to retire, effective January 31, 2020, following scrutiny for potentially inappropriate relationships. He will not receive an exit package. In the months leading up to his announcement, Drummond sold off over $200 million of his Alphabet stock."

He later also served as president of the LDS Church's Oakland California Stake. Hoopes served as chairman and member of the Board of the Foundation for American Agriculture; vice chairman and member of the Board of the Farm Foundation; president and member of California\u2019s Coordinating Council for Higher Education; chairman, director, and secretary of the National Dairy Council; and chairman and member of the National Advisory Council. Hoopes was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).  Hoopes served as president of the England Bristol Mission of the LDS Church from 1979-1982.  He served as president of the Oakland Temple from 1985 to 1990. Hoopes served for 17 years as a member of the Oakland School board. Hoopes' wife, Stella Bobbies Sorenson Hoopes, died on January 14, 1996.  Among Hoopes' children is David C. Hoopes and Janet Hoopes (deceased). Hoopes was as of January 2010 the head of the Paramount Theatre Board in Oakland, California.  The Paramount Theatre is a public institution with a board that appoints new members, with the consent of the city council and mayor, but in the past the decisions of the board have always been upheld.  Hoopes was believed to be the person in Oakland who donated the largest amount of money to the Yes on Proposition 8 campaign, which caused some to seek to oust Hoopes from his unpaid volunteer position with the Paramount Theatre.  He sat on the board of the theatre for nearly 30 years."

The city now attracts 16 million tourists annually, boasts 10 bourbon attractions, such as distilleries on the historic Main Street Whiskey Row. Along with the redeveloped and expanded downtown convention center, bourbonism has been a factor in multiple new hotels opening in the city, including the Omni Louisville in 2018 and Moxy/Hotel Distil  in October 2019. The Fischer Administration has focused on attracting investment lower income neighborhoods, resulting in about $1 billion of investment in west Louisville. Among the investments happening in the predominantly African-American neighborhoods are the redevelopment of the Beecher Terrace public housing site through a $29.5 million federal grant, a new YMCA at the historic 18th Street and Broadway intersection, and a new track and learning development by the Louisville Urban League with support from the city.

In 2019, Microsoft announced that Louisville would be its regional hub  for artificial intelligence, internet of things, and data science. Earlier, in 2013, the city under Fischer worked to launch Code Louisville, a nationally recognized program that offers free coding training to Louisville residents. In June 2019, Fischer announced further efforts to scale Louisville's tech talent development efforts. During his first nine years in office, the local economy added 80,000 jobs and 2,700 new businesses have opened. Over the course of Fischer's tenure as Mayor, the net unemployment rate has dropped from 10.2% in January 2011, to 3.3% in September 2019. In 2014, Fischer cut ties with the regional commerce organization Greater Louisville Inc., citing concerns over the organization's financial stability and leadership. Fischer then created a new Economic Development branch named Louisville Forward, creating 3,500 jobs and close to $500,000,000 in local investments its first 10 months, while being named one of the top 10 economic development groups in the United States. However, during his tenure, Louisville has struggled to catch up to neighboring metropolitan areas in percentage of \"high paying jobs\", ranking 9th out of 17th in the region."

The day after the rally, Fischer announced that Louisville's Commission on Public Art would begin a review of public works in the city and collect a list of works that could be seen as \"honoring bigotry, racism, and slavery.\" This statement was made in conjunction with Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, who said he was \"taking steps to remove two Confederate monuments from city property.\" With the announcement, Fischer said: \"I recognize that some people say all these monuments should be left alone, because they are part of our history, but we need to discuss and interpret our history from multiple perspectives and from different viewpoints. That's why a community conversation is crucial. [...] Both our human values and the future of our city depend on our ability to directly address the challenges that stop each and every citizen from realizing their potential. We, as a compassionate community, must again come together and face up to the stain of slavery and racism, as we move toward a future that embraces diversity as a strength.\" The announcement also came hours after a statue in Louisville's Cherokee Park depicting Confederate officer John Breckinridge Castleman was vandalized. In response to the vandalism, Fischer said, \"For many, this statue is a beloved neighborhood landmark, but for others, it's a symbol of a painful, tragic and divisive time in our history\u2014which gets at the complexity of this conversation.\" On August 8, 2018, Fischer announced that the Castleman statue and a statue of George D. Prentice would be moved. The next January, Fischer announced the launch of Lean Into Louisville, \"an unprecedented series of presentations, conversations, activities and art exhibits that will explore and confront the history and legacy of all forms of discrimination and inequality in the city and the country.\""

On December 18, Fischer announced that he and the Metro Council had compromised and that Louisville would raise its hourly minimum wage to $9 over three years. The ordinance also included numerous exceptions found in other minimum wage laws, most notably excluding agricultural workers. On October 20, 2016, the Kentucky Supreme Court overturned the city's minimum wage laws, reversing an earlier ruling by a Jefferson County judge and holding that hourly wages are regulated at the state level and that Louisville's ordinance conflicted with state law. In response, Fischer and a majority of the Metro Council called on the Kentucky General Assembly to allow the city to set its own minimum wage law."

        "content": "On June 22, 2017, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced that he was working on banning state-funded travel to Kentucky as a response to a bill signed by Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin. The law was designed to reinforce students' ability to express religious and political views in public schools and universities. But the bill also said religious and political student organizations cannot be hindered or discriminated against for the way they conduct their internal affairs or how they select their leaders and members. Critics say those provisions could be used to let student groups prevent LGBTQ students from joining their ranks. On June 26, 2017, Fischer and Lexington Mayor Jim Gray sent the California Attorney General's Office a letter asking for their cities to be excluded from the ban. \"Please consider exempting cities like Louisville from your travel ban,\" the letter states. \"It is my belief that cities like ours should be rewarded for an inclusive behavior, not penalized; a waiver would highlight our inclusivity and encourage other cities to follow accordingly.\" A week later, Becerra replied that California could lift the ban only if city officials were able to \"make progress with leaders in your state\" to repeal or amend the law. On June 27, 2017, Fischer announced via Twitter that the city was already feeling the negative effects of the ban, citing an \"unnamed convention\" that had allegedly chosen to move its venue elsewhere as a show of solidarity with the ban.  He further elaborated on Facebook, writing, \"We are very concerned about others [leaving]\" and \"Tourism/conventions are a key driver of our economy.\" A few days later, Karen Williams, president and CEO of the Louisville Convention and Visitors Bureau, announced in a press conference with Fischer that a second convention had pulled out of the city. Williams said one convention was slated for 2018 and the other for 2021, but declined to name them because they are \"still looking for other venues outside the city.\" She said both groups were based in Chicago and one was a \"medical association\" and the other a \"prestigious research Association.\""

        "content": "Breonna Taylor was a former Louisville EMT killed in her home in March 2020. Louisville Metro Police Department had received a warrant to search her residence and vehicle due to surveillance in an ongoing drug trafficking investigation which noted she had been seen at the home of her former boyfriend, a drug trafficker known to police. It was also confirmed by USPS that Taylor's former boyfriend had received packages at her home. The warrant was issued as a \"no knock\" warrant, but both officers and Taylor's boyfriend at the time, Kenneth Walker, who was present, confirmed police knocked on at least four occasions. Police say they were also announcing, though Walker said he did not hear them identifying themselves. When police received no answer after the final episode of knocking they breached the door and were met with gunfire. Taylor was stuck several times and pronounced dead at the scene. Initially Walker told police it was Taylor who had shot at them  but upon further questioning he admitted he had fired the gun, saying he believed it was a home invasion. Fischer's handling of the case[howso?], his decision not to arrest the police officers,  and the recent murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis led to widespread protests across Louisville. On June 12, 2020, Fischer said he would sign \"Breonna's Law\" after it was passed unanimously by city council members. The law bans \"no knock\" warrants, a controversial procedure requested by LMPD police that led to the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor. It was later determined that police did in fact knock, but whether they announced themselves as police is disputed, as the officers had turned off their body cams. Fischer called the four-page incident report the LMPD filed regarding Taylor's death \"unacceptable\", but did not call for the officers' arrest, citing the ongoing investigation in the hands of the Kentucky Attorney General. On July 16, 2020, it was announced that the Government Oversight and Audit Committee (GOA) of the Louisville Metro Council had officially launched an investigation \"into the action and inaction of the Fischer Administration\" in regard to the handling of the Taylor case and the death of David McAtee, as well as the handling of the resulting protests. McAtee was a Louisville business owner who responded with gunfire to the firing of pepper balls by LMPD and National Guardsmen enforcing a curfew upon protestors; he was shot by a Kentucky National Guardsman. On September 17, 2020, The Louisville Metro Council approved a resolution that declared \"no confidence\" in Fischer over his handling of Taylor's death and the subsequent unrest."

He reported that his father died when he was nine years old. After graduating from Schenley High School in 1927, he attended the University of Pittsburgh from 1929 to 1931, majoring in zoology, before transferring to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, which had more course offerings in zoology. He was an assistant in the zoology department and did taxidermical work. In 1932, he went to Texas to collect Typhlomolge rathbuni cave salamanders. He wanted to also trap small mammals, which he found more interesting, but had no traps to do that. On a chance visit to the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH) in Chicago, he befriended the Curator of Mammals there, Colin Campbell Sanborn, who loaned him the supplies he needed. This event was the beginning of Hershkovitz's long relationship with the FMNH. As the Great Depression worsened, Hershkovitz was no longer able to afford life in Michigan, and in 1933 he decided to move to Ecuador, which he was told was one of the cheapest countries in the Americas to live in. He collected a number of mammal specimens and learned to speak Spanish, supporting himself in part by trading in horses. He returned in 1937 and again enrolled at Ann Arbor, graduating in 1938. Subsequently, he became a graduate student there and got his MSc degree in 1940. He then entered the doctoral program, but in 1941 he was awarded a Walter Rathbone Bacon Traveling Scholarship by the United States National Museum in Washington, D.C., to work in the Santa Marta area of northern Colombia, where he stayed till 1943. Hershkovitz enlisted in the U.S. Armed Services during World War II and served the Office of Strategic Services in Europe. In 1945, he married Anne Marie Pierrette Dode, whom he had met in France, and the same year he returned to America to continue his Bacon Scholarship studies in Washington, D.C., where his first child of three\u2014Francine, Michael, and Mark\u2014was born in 1946."

His Colombian collections remained at the center of his research interests afterward, as he entirely revised many taxa of which he had found representatives in Colombia. He had a good relationship with Chief Curator of the Department of Zoology Karl P. Schmidt and actively took care of his curatorial duties (appointed Associate Curator in 1954 and full Curator in 1956). Schmidt retired in 1957 and his successor, Austin P. Rand, enjoyed a less positive relation with Hershkovitz, and the latter detached himself from the Museum's day-to-day affairs. Ultimately, in 1962, Hershkovitz was replaced as Curator of Mammals by Joseph Moore and took the unprecedented title of Research Curator.

        "content": "Hershkovitz published extensively on the biology of each of the twelve orders of Neotropical mammals, focusing generally on taxonomy and biogeography. He wrote 164 papers, including both broad monographs and smaller contributions, and described 67 new species and subspecies and 13 new genera. He was an independent researcher, writing most of his contributions alone; only three he co-authored with other scientists. He participated in some fiery scientific debates, with views that according to Patterson's biographical note \"brand him as something other than conciliatory or diplomatic\". In 1968, he published his theory of metachromism, which attempts to explain variation in fur coloration among mammals through the loss of one of two classes of pigments in the hairs. Hershkovitz may have been most well known for his studies of primates, to the extent that many thought him a primatologist, but he was quick to point out that, as Patterson phrases it, \"nothing could be further from the truth\". He had published on primates earlier, but did not give them special attention until the 1960s, when grant opportunities persuaded him to begin studying them, first Callitrichidae and later Cebidae. In 1977, he published a review of callitrichids that according to Ronald H. Pine was \"the most heroically monumental revisionary monograph ever devoted to a Neotropical group\"; it was to be the first volume of a comprehensive treatment of living New World monkeys. He continued with smaller-scale papers on cebids and assembled notes to continue his series on living New World monkeys, but eventually financial support ceased and Hershkovitz was relieved to be able to spend the last decade of his life studying the mammals that most \"intrigued and animated\" him\u2014rodents and marsupials. One of Hershkovitz's first papers was on rodents, describing two new Ecuadorean squirrels in 1938, and he continued to publish about the group, including reviews of Nectomys, Oecomys, Phyllotini, Holochilus, and scapteromyines between 1944 and 1966. He played an important role in formalizing and defining the tribal groups within the sigmodontine rodents of South America. However, his contributions at the time have been cited as examples of \"vague notions of clade recognition\", \"phylogenetic transcendentalism\" unsubstantiated by data, and \"[misleading simplification] of a complex reality\". He was engaged in discussions on the significance of penis morphology in sigmodontines and on their origin. Over eighty years old, he resumed studies of rodents in Brazil and discovered many additional new species. Shortly after his death, head of the FMNH's mammal division Lawrence Heaney said \"The information he gathered was the basis for much of the conservation planning that's being done now in most of the major habitats in South America.\" In 1966, he published a Catalog of Living Whales; he had originally intended to review the whales living off the South American coast, but expanded the project to all the world's species. This Catalog remains an invaluable resource for any student of cetaceans who needs to know the meaning of some obscure old name and has been called \"a taxonomic Rosetta Stone\". Although Hershkovitz was not a marine mammalogist, a brief obituary on him appeared in Marine Mammals Science in 1998. He treated many other mammals in his publications, including reviews of marsupials such as Gracilinanus, Philander, and Dromiciops, the tapirs of the Americas, some of the cottontail rabbits of South America, and also published extensively on nomenclature."

Their family could trace its line back to John and Sarah Clary who arrived in Watertown in 1640. The younger Clarys were raised in a house at Benton Park, at the corner of State and Federal streets in Springfield, where their father clerked a few blocks away at the armory. Springfield's Walnut Street was named after the trees which lined the Clary property. Appointed to the U. S. Military Academy in 1823, Clary graduated thirteenth in his class of 1828. Commissioned a second lieutenant in the 5th U.S. Infantry Regiment, Clary, like many in his class, was sent to the Jefferson Barracks at St. Louis, Missouri. On March 31, 1829, Clary married his first wife, Esther Philipson, the daughter of a prosperous merchant family; West Point classmate Jefferson Davis served as his best man."

        "content": "In 1921, Steger enrolled at the University of Michigan where he played halfback from 1922 to 1924, helping the Wolverines to back-to-back undefeated football seasons in 1922 and 1923.  He was considered a \"triple threat\" player who had \"about equal ability in kicking, forward passing and carrying the ball.\" In Steger's sophomore year of 1922, the Wolverines were 6\u20130\u20131 and outscored opponents by a combined tally of 183 to 13.  In Steger's first game for Michigan, he ran 60 yards for a touchdown on his first carry.  Steger developed appendicitis late in the 1922 season and underwent surgery in Chicago in December 1922. As a junior in 1923, Steger helped lead the Wolverines to an 8\u20130 record and outscored opponents 150 to 12. Michigan's first conference game in 1923 was against Ohio State in Ann Arbor.  Fifty-thousand spectators watched Michigan shut out the Buckeyes 23\u20130.  Michigan's first touchdown was scored on a 16-yard pass from Irwin Uteritz to Steger in the third quarter. Some suggested during the 1923 season that Steger \"has even outshone, the great Kipke.\"  An NEA news service profile in late October 1923 praised Steger's diverse talents:\"Steger, today, ranks as one of the best gridders Yost has had in seasons. Captain Harry Kipke not excepted. Fleet of foot, a good forward passer, splendid punter, and an expert field goal kicker, the former Oak Park lad is a triple threat artist de luxe. There is no getting away from that. He also is as good a bet as the Wolverines boast on the receiving end of a pass, having the uncanny ability to grab 'em out of the air on almost impossible chances.\" At the end of the 1923 football season, Steger was elected as captain of the 1924 Michigan Wolverines football team.  Through the first half of October 1924, the Wolverines remained undefeated, and Steger had never played a game for a losing football team.  In four years at Oak Park and two full seasons at Michigan (1922 and 1923), Steger's teams had not lost a single game.  In the buildup to the 1924 game between Michigan and Red Grange's Illinois team, the press played up Steger's winning streak. The following excerpt typifies the coverage:\"In Captain Herbert Steger Michigan has something more than a dog-gone good halfback. It has a symbol of good fortune and victory. Steger is Michigan's rabbit's foot.  In all the time he has been playing football he has yet to taste the unpalatable dregs of defeat. ... Steger was one of the best backs in the conferehce last year. But you can tell the wide world that Michigan is pinning part of its hopes for the Big Ten championship this season on the luck of its captain.  He hasn't failed yet.  When he meets Illinois and matches the old rabbit's foot against Red Grange's threats he will be subjecting his charmed football life to its severest strain.\" His streak came to an end in the Illinois game on October 19, 1924.  The game was the dedication game for the new Memorial Stadium in Urbana, Illinois.  Grange took Steger's opening kickoff and ran it back 95 yards for a touchdown.  Grange scored five touchdowns in the game and ran for 402 yards.  After the game, Illini fans and player praised Steger for his sportsmanship and bravery in the game.  Illini players reported that Steger had \"arched his body over Grange while tackling him to prevent an injury to the man who blasted the hopes of Michigan.\" Steger was the Wolverines' second leading scorer in 1924 with five touchdowns for 30 points. At the end of the 1924 season, Steger was selected as a third-team All-American by All-Sports Magazine, based on the combined vote of 312 prominent football coaches, officials and sport writers from all sections of the country, \"representing the opinions of the best informed critics in all parts of the country.\""

On the foundation of Radley College, in 1847, he became the second of only two pupils (the first to register was George Melhuish) when the school opened on 17 August 1847.  In 1897 he wrote and published posthumously his reminiscences of the school.  In it he described the terrible rioting, and ensuing beatings meted out by the bespectacled Warden.  For a long time he remained the oldest boy in the school to whom Singleton and the other Fellows looked for responsibility towards the younger pupils.  Boys ignored the Warden's censure to prayer, which he hid a multitude of bad habits and \"inattention\".  He was scathing of Singleton's \"treatment of his boys\" although he had never actually been delegated duty as a Prefect. In 1850 Reynolds was awarded a scholarship to Exeter College at Oxford, placed in the first-class degree in classics at moderations at Michaelmas 1852, and in the first class in literae humaniores at Easter 1854. In 1853 he obtained the Newdigate Prize and the Chancellor's English Essay Prize, his theme being 'The Ruins of Egyptian Thebes.' On 2 February 1855 Reynolds was elected probationer fellow of Brasenose College, and actual fellow on 2 February 1856. He edited Bacon's essays and wrote Notes on the Iliad. He afterwards became tutor and bursar of the college. In 1856 he obtained the chancellor's prize for an English essay on ' The Reciprocal Action of the Physical and Moral Condition of Countries upon each other.' He proceeded M.A. in 1857."

The performance includes both acting and playing the guitar and is regularly toured by Schaupp. Schaupp says she was initially nervous about airing the family history. \"I took quite a bit of convincing, but David made me realise if we were going to tell the story, we had to tell the whole story. There are many layers: a love story, a war story, a musical story.\" Williamson said that despite Lotte's thwarted ambition, her story was a happy one. \"One of the terrific things is that Karin's grandmother's need to perform has finally come out.\" Schaupp starred in some 150 performances of Lotte's Gift, including a four-week season at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2009. Schaupp released Spain in 2009 which features works by Rodrigo, Salvador Bacarisse and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. It was recorded with the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra and the choir Cantillation.

During an interview for De Zevende Dag, Torfs appeared wearing a tie with a white rabbit print on it, which prompted the nickname. As a member of CD&V he aspired to reconceptualize the political ideology of the party together with Inge Vervotte and others. According to Torfs, these attempts failed to broaden the internal debate within the party and didn't give rise to change within the party because of the highly rigid and hierarchical nature of the party system and its decision-making. From this perspective he started to think about leaving politics in the end of 2012. In March 2013 he quit politics and announced his candidacy to become Rector of KU Leuven."

When she was young, her sperm donor, Thomas Haus Steel, a lawyer known for civil rights cases and a gay man, and that of Cade sometimes vacationed with the family, \"until those relationships ruptured\"; in Russo and Young's view \"it was a given that Steel would have no parental rights, although they made it clear he was welcome to visit the family and to get to know Ry and Cade\", and when Steel sought permission to take Russo-Young to see his parents and grandmother, they refused, leading him to file for paternity. In 1991, Steel sued Russo-Young's mothers for recognition as father and for immediate visitation, losing the initial judgement but winning on appeal to the State Supreme Court; he never enforced his right to visitation and only spoke with Russo-Young once more before his death from AIDS in 1998, aged 48; Russo-Young, having heard of his fatal illness, called him: \"'He was high on medicine... saying, \"I'm sorry, I loved you, I never meant to hurt you, I always wanted to be your father.\" But after going through the case, I was rolling my eyes. You know: \"So now you want me to forgive you because you're on your deathbed?\"... I mean, there was a time when I did care a lot about him... Not as a father - more like an icon of a man.'\" Steel's New York Times obituary, listing his partner and son, parents, and siblings, made no reference to Russo-Young. Russo-Young has explored her upbringing in her work, particularly in the 2021 three-part HBO documentary Nuclear Family. She attended Oberlin College and  Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn. As of 2019, she resided in Los Angeles, California."

He has served at senior levels in the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and as commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). He is currently the President of Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), an advocacy nonprofit that forges lasting solutions to the environmental challenges for the people of New England. Campbell was born in Northeast Philadelphia. His Lebanese family had adopted the surname \"Campbell\" as an American version of its family name Kamel and his father gave him the middle name \"McAllerton\" to make him sound as Americanized as possible. His father died when Bradley was eight years old, so he was raised by Jewish stepfathers and an uncle; he would say in jest that his \"aspiration is to become ambassador-at-large in the Middle East\". He attended the Friends' Central School and learned to sail during summers spent at the Echo Hill Outdoor School. Campbell earned his undergraduate degree from Amherst College in 1983 and was awarded a J.D. degree from the University of Chicago Law School, where he was an editor of the University of Chicago Law Review. After graduating he was a law clerk for United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Judge Carl E. McGowan. He entered private practice as an attorney at the firm of Rogovin, Huge & Schiller, working on civil and criminal litigation, representing environmental organizations in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Campbell served on the White House Council on Environmental Quality, overseeing executive office policy on issues including agricultural policy, brownfield land and Superfund sites. At the United States Department of Justice, he was lead counsel in the case Kelley v. EPA on lender liability which reaffirmed the obligation of polluters to cover the costs of cleaning up Superfund sites. In 1993, Campbell received the Arthur S. Flemming Award for distinguished government service, which is based on a national competition. He was also chosen that year to receive the John Marshall Award, the highest level of recognition granted by the Department of Justice. Campbell was nominated by President Clinton on December 15, 1999, to serve as the Regional Administrator of EPA's Middle Atlantic Region succeeding W. Michael McCabe, who had been named Deputy Administrator. As regional administrator, in cooperation with governors and senior state officials, Campbell directed the implementation of federal environmental programs in the states of Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Campbell took office as head of NJDEP in January 2002, having been nominated to the post by Governor Jim McGreevey. In October 2004 Senator Anthony Bucco of Morris County invoked senatorial courtesy to block four nominations to the Highlands Commission. Bucco sought to register his concern about how the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act would limit development in the New Jersey Highlands, and dropped his block after Campbell met with Bucco, Senator Guy R. Gregg and the mayors of several municipalities in Morris County, with Bucco saying \"All I wanted was my day in court\". After his appointment to NJDEP, Campbell moved to Lambertville, New Jersey, where he lives with his wife, artist Katherine Hackl. Since resigning as Commissioner of NJDEP in 2006, he has worked as an attorney and consultant specializing in issues related to the environment, energy, entrepreneurship, and science. Campbell became President of the Conservation Law Foundation on September 8, 2015."

Vidmer began the 1967 season as the starting quarterback, and Michigan won one game and lost three under Vidmer.  Brown was brought into the game in the second half against Michigan State. Although the Wolverines lost the game 34\u20130, Brown's performance was good enough to win him the starting assignment the following week.  Teammate George Hoey later recalled, \"From an emotional standpoint, I know that when Dennis came in, he was just a spark plug.  He had a fiery spirit and that permeated through the team.\"  Vidmer had the stronger throwing arm, but Brown was more mobile. Brown's first start came against Indiana.  Although Michigan lost the game 27\u201320, Brown established himself as a star.  He completed 18 of 31 passes for 211 yards and led the team in rushing with 127 yards and two touchdowns.  He also broke two Big Ten Conference records.  He accumulated 338 yards of total offense, breaking the single game conference record set by Bob Griese with 317 yards in 1966.  He was also involved in 61 plays to surpass the conference record set by Paul Giel with 53 plays in 1953. Three weeks later against Wisconsin, Brown completed 12 of 17 passes for 232 yards.  He threw touchdown passes of 60 yards to Jim Berline and 31 yards to Ron Johnson and scrambled 44 yards for a rushing touchdown.  He totaled 274 yards of total offense before leaving the game in the fourth quarter after he had the wind knocked out of him by a Wisconsin tackler. In the final game of the 1967 season against Ohio State, Brown was 17 for 24 passing for 179 yards and two touchdowns.  In the closing minutes of the first half, Brown led the Wolverines on an 80-yard drive, capped by a six-yard touchdown pass to Jim Berline.  The second score came on a 47-yard drive in the fourth quarter, ending with a 13-yard touchdown pass to John Gabler.  Brown's two touchdown passes were not enough as Michigan was limited to 128 rushing yards and lost to the Buckeyes, 24\u201314. In the final six games of the season, with Brown as the starting quarterback, Michigan improved to 3\u20133.  During the 1967 season, Brown completed 82 of 155 pass attempts for 928 yards and seven touchdowns.  Despite starting only six games, Brown set a new Big Ten season record for most offensive plays with 290, breaking the prior record of 276 plays by Gary Snook in 1964."

        "content": "As a senior, Brown was the starting quarterback in 9 of 10 games for the 1968 team that finished 8\u20132 in Bump Elliott's last year as head coach. In mid-October, Brown led Michigan to a come-from-behind win over Michigan State.  One sports writer opened his game coverage as follows:\"Bundle up when you go out in the cold, Dennis Brown.  Wear your galoshes and that maize and blue muffler.  And please don't slip in the shower or slam a finger in a car door.  Michigan needs you, Dennis Brown.  You were charmed Saturday when you brought your Wolverines from behind in the fourth quarter to hand Michigan State its first loss, 28\u201314.\" After Brown led Michigan to a 33\u201320 win over Minnesota with 152 passing yards and passing touchdowns to Billy Harris and Paul Staroba, the Golden Gophers' head coach Murray Warmath said: \"Brown was the big player.  He was a genius on the field.  I've never seen a better game from a quarterback.  This is what chopped us up.  His quick passes were tremendous.  [Ron] Johnson's a great back and he runs real well, but Brown was the big man today.\" Two weeks later, Brown had his best game of the 1968 season against Illinois.  He led Michigan to a 36-0 win, completing 13 of 27 passes for 226 yards and throwing touchdown passes of 69 yards to Billy Harris and 14 yards to Paul Staroba.  In that game, Brown added 45 rushing yards for 271 total offensive yards.  In the third quarter, he threw a 69-yard touchdown pass to William Harris for Michigan's longest scoring play of the 1968 season.  After the score, Brown ran for a two-point conversion. Brown finished the season with 109 complete passes for 1,562 yards, 12 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions, and ranked as the Big Ten's leader in total offense. He was selected by the Associated Press as the first-team quarterback on the 1968 All-Big Ten Conference football team, and was also selected to play quarterback in the 1968 East\u2013West Shrine Game and the 1969 Hula Bowl."

Its popularity shifted Brown's work from relative obscurity in academia into the mainstream spotlight. The talk \"summarizes a decade of Brown\u2019s research on shame, framing her weightiest discoveries in self-deprecating and personal terms.\" Reggie Ugwu for The New York Times said that this event gave the world \"a new star of social psychology.\" She went on to follow this popular TED talk with another titled \"Listening to Shame\" in 2012. In the second talk she talks about how her life has changed since the first talk and explains the connection between shame and vulnerability, building on the thesis of her first TED talk. Brown also has a less well-known talk from 2010 given at TEDxKC titled \"The Price of Invulnerability.\" In it she explains that when numbing hard and difficult feelings, essentially feeling vulnerable, we also numb positive emotions, like joy. This lead to the creation of her filmed lecture, Bren\u00e9 Brown: The Call to Courage, which debuted on Netflix in 2019. USA Today called it \"a mix of a motivational speech and stand-up comedy special.\" Brown discusses how and why to choose courage over comfort, equating being brave to being vulnerable. According to her research, doing this opens us up to love, joy, and belonging by allowing us to better know ourselves and be more deeply connect with other people. Brown also regularly works as a public speaker at private events and businesses, such as at Alain de Botton's School of Life and at Google and Disney."

Holch earned an Emmy Award for a 1991 documentary broadcast on HBO documenting the life of a German man who had been a member of the Hitler Youth and then turned against the Nazis. Holch was born on March 13, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska. Raised in Denver, he earned his undergraduate degree there from the University of Denver and was awarded a master's degree from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. During the Korean War, Holch served as a military intelligence officer in United States Army Reserve, stationed in Tokyo. He started in the news field as a reporter at the Rocky Mountain News before heading east. Moving to New York City, Holch was hired by CBS Radio and then for the NBC television network. Establishing Round Hill Productions for his own independent work, Holch wrote the script for the hour-long documentary Walk in My Shoes which was produced and directed by Nicholas Webster. The film, nominated for an Emmy Award, was broadcast on ABC television in 1961, though some stations in the South pre-empted the show, with a Chattanooga, Tennessee station choosing to air a Billy Graham program in its place. The documentary featured profiles of African American life across social classes in New York City as seen through the eyes of such individuals as taxi divers, comedian Dick Gregory and lawyer-turned-politician Percy Sutton. The New York Herald Tribune credited \"Walk in My Shoes\" with providing \"an infinitely deeper understanding and sense of concern for an appalling American problem\" and said it was \"one of the finest documentaries ever offered on television\". Television critic Jack Gould of The New York Times called Walk in My Shoes \"nothing short of an unforgettable visit to the world of the Negro in the United States\" providing \"a viewer the sobering experience of living for a moment in the Negro's world and sharing the frustration that is his lot\" that was captured \"to a degree never before achieved in TV documentary\". Heil Hitler! Confessions of a Hitler Youth was a half-hour documentary Holch developed for HBO, which described Alfons Heck who had been a member of the Hitler Youth in his teens and had been a vigorous supporter of Adolf Hitler, but had turned against the Nazis and spoke widely about his transformation. The film won a 1992 Emmy Award for News & Documentary. He also created documentaries about life behind the Iron Curtain which were broadcast on ABC, producing and directing the 1967 film The Beautiful Blue and Red Danube and Cuba: The Castro Generation in 1977. His 1972 work Chile: Experiment in Red documented life under the rule of Salvador Allende. A resident of Greenwich, Connecticut since 1955, Holch later learned that he came from one of the city's founding families. At the time of his death he was working on Greenwich: The Golden Apple: Big Bucks, Big Names, Big Deals, a book about Greenwich over the past two centuries. Holch died in a hospital in Greenwich at the age of 86 on September 23, 2010, due to heart failure. He was survived by his wife, the former Ellen O'Keefe Hare, as well as by four daughters, three sons, and seven grandchildren."

He was among the 10 signatories of the manifesto of 1970, that led to 'the uprising of the young officials ' ('de opstand van de jonge referendarissen') and then to the integration of the ministry (binnendienst) and the diplomatic service (buitendienst). When the 1970 Act Reforming the  University Governance Structure (WUB / Law Veringa) took effect, Veldhuis turned back to his first functional love: he accepted at Leiden University a function, created to implement this WUB. Late 1972 he became head of the Governance and Law Office\u00b4, and Secretary of the newly formed (Executive) Board of the University. In 1974 he was appointed deputy permanent secretary-general of the Ministry of Education and Science (O & W) to the  permanent secretary-general Maarten Van Wolferen, and the Minister Jos van Kemenade (1973\u20131977), who in 1973 had started his constructive education policy (Contourennota). Veldhuis had secondary education as a special area (middenschool-debate). Also, he chaired the team of the planning for the McKinsey reorganization of the inspectorate of education. In November 1978 he led the O & W -team, that supported Minister Arie Pais (1977\u20131981) in the 'Aantjes- affair'. In 1979 Veldhuis was appointed director-general services education and inspectorate (DGDI), also inspector-general of education (IGO). In these positions he was faced with difficult policy issues: as DG with Minister Pais especially the mergers of teacher training colleges, and with Minister Wim Deetman(1982\u20131989) the significant budget cuts of the Lubbers cabinet, including the lowering of teachers' salaries; and as IGO with the implementation of the new organization of the inspectorate, the setting up of an inspectorate for the universities, and with the pupils fraud, especially in primary schools, connected with the very rapid decrease of the birth rate, 28% in the years 1969-1977. Veldhuis was one of the first who \u2014after 25 years emphasis on equal opportunities\u2014 asked attention  again, despite political opposition,  for also the quality of education. This got him in 1983 the participation in the U.S. International Visitor Leadership Program for research into the 'Quality of Education in the USA'. His reporting led to a notorious publication in the leading Dutch newspaper NRC, and to a separate chapter \u2013 of his hand - on the quality of education in the explanatory memorandum to the O & W 1985 budget. With the U.S. ambassador Paul Bremer III he, as representative of Minister Deetman, innovated the Dutch Fulbright program. In 1985 he became chairman of the board of the Fulbright Commission, a subsidiary function he performed the following 16 years. In this period he\u2014together with Paul Bremer and Fulbright-director Marcel Oomen\u2014connected Fulbright fellowships with the fellowships of the Netherland-America Foundation, NAF, in New York. Starting 1986 Veldhuis was appointed by Minister Deetman, President (Chairman of the Board) of Utrecht University, as the ninth president in fourteen years. He there succeeded former cabinet minister Leendert Ginjaar. In his first years he was confronted with much opposition inside the university. The provision with a university car --the same provision as his predecessor got\u2014 caused a lot of protests: questions in the Dutch parliament, disapproval of the item concerned in the university budget, formal appeal by his board to the Council of State and final approval after nearly two years. In the University Council and in the university newspaper the attitude towards him often was of a negative, sometimes hostile nature. He was considered as a 'man from outside', a \"Hague bureaucrat\" and/or \"a satrap of Minister Deetman\". But he withstood, and, with the loyal backing of his colleagues, he gradually got the necessary support and confidence to restore in the university the much needed governance balance and stability. Within two years the budget was balanced again. And despite strong resistance \u2014with a strike, an occupation of the main administrative building and a short cause in court in May 1988\u2014the Board under his leadership carried through a major reorganization of the university: 'Bestuurlijke Vernieuwing/Governance Renewal 1987-1991'. Among others the size of the central university office was reduced from about 800 officials to about 250, by not filling vacancies anymore, dismissals, decentralization and (semi-)privatizations. This operation was deliberately combined with a strategic process of renewal and profiling of the primary processes, education and research: 'RUU 2001/Utrecht University towards 2001'. These two operations were repeated in the mid 90s for another period of ten years. In the view of many Veldhuis and rector Van Ginkel and later on rector Gispen were the major sources of inspiration and the main architects of the remarkable renaissance in the recent decades of this ancient university. They were supported by an administrative office of increasing quality (under the direction of Wim Kardux, Maarten Rook, Erwin Vermeulen, Joop Kessels). These strategic operations had many results, among which some remarkable ones, also nationwide:"

These and also many informal activities and provisions gave a solid base and firm conditions for new self-confidence and pride among university personnel and students, so pivotal for a sense of community, necessary for daring and new initiatives. This policy and activities resulted in a rather impressive increase of quality of education and research. On behalf of the Association of Dutch Universities, VSNU, Veldhuis for many years chaired te Education Committee, StOA, in charge of among others the reduction of the number of academic courses (by 50%), the preparation of the replacement in the secondary school curriculum of the 270 different 'packages'(pakketten) by 4 'profiles'(profielen) and the renovation of the history curriculum in the secondary schools (restoration of chronology according to the proposals of the committee of Roel de Wit and that of Piet de Rooy) Veldhuis in 1995 was conferred a doctorate h.c. by the University of Florida, USA, and in 1997, 1998 and 2001 he was decorated by respectively the governments of France, the Netherlands and Spain. In the spring of 1997 his Board briefly got into political trouble by a salary increase, after ten years of no change of about 20%.  The problem was quickly and smoothly discarded. A few years later the salaries of the board members of all Dutch universities in a nationwide leveling up were increased by about 60%. The affair did not harm the position and authority of the board. In 1997 rector Hans van Ginkel was appointed rector of the United Nations University, headquarters Tokyo. In 1999 two Utrecht professors got the Nobel Prize for physics: Martinus Veltman and Gerard 't Hooft. In 2001 the king of Spain Juan Carlos was awarded an honorary doctorate of Utrecht University. In 2002 the Prince Claus Chair was established, with Princess/Queen Maxima as chair of the Board of Curators (initiative of rector Gispen and prof. Bas de Gaay Fortman) The term of board membership being 4 years Veldhuis was reappointed four times. In 2003 he retired after 18 years of presidency. Utrecht University then not only had become the largest university of the Netherlands, but according to Elsevier Magazine also the best teaching university, and according to the international Shanghai- and CHE- rankings, and later on also the THESS-ranking, the best research university as well. Veldhuis after his retirement performed and still performs many other functions. These included and include: Member of the supervisory board of the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, TNO, Delft (2003\u20132008); Chairman of the board of the Netherlands Society for International Affairs, NGIZ, department Utrecht (1995\u20132008); Chairman of the board of 'Quality Assurance Netherlands Universities', QANU, Utrecht (2004-..)

Prager Publishers, 1996.</ref> An uncle, Jean Fran\u00e7ois Guerrier, otherwise Frantz Ivanovitch Guerrier, had arrived in the time of Catherine the Great to work as a millwright. Guerrier lost both parents as  a small child and was brought up by relations as a Lutheran. He received his secondary education in Moscow at the parish school of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Peter and Paul on Kozmodemyansk Street, now Starosadskiy Lane. In 1854 he entered the historical-philological faculty of the Moscow State University, where he was a student of Granovsky. Upon completing this course, he was retained by the university to prepare for a professorship, and at the same time he became a teacher of literature and history to the first Moscow Cadet Corps. In 1862, he defended his master's thesis: The struggle for the Polish throne in 1733, and then travelled abroad, spending three years in Germany, Italy and Paris. In 1865 he was elected a professor in the department of general history at Moscow University and began teaching there. Guerrier was a lifelong friend of the philosopher Vladimir Solovyov. A strong campaigner for the independence of universities, in an article in Vestnik Evropy in 1876, Guerrier expressed the opposition of most Russian university professors in attacking proposals by Liubimov to transplant important features of the German system of university education into Russia. In 1879, Count Dmitry Tolstoy abolished the professors' disciplinary courts, but the subsequent University Statute of 1884 proved unworkable and had to be repealed.Ben Eklof, John Bushnell, & Larisa Georgievna Zakharova, Russia's great reforms, 1855\u20131881 p. 258 online at books.google.co.uk Guerrier was not considered an impressive public speaker. One writer has called him \"prolix, fairly boring\", contrasting him with a riveting performance by Kovalevsky. Guerrier wrote in Russian, German, and French. His study of Mably and Jacobinism appeared in French in 1886 and was published in Paris, while a major work on Leibniz appeared in German. Critics have suggested that he turned to the French Revolution \"to stigmatize opponents of the Russian monarchy\". Guerrier died in 1919 and is buried in Moscow at the Pyatnitskaya cemetery. His daughter Elena Vladimirovna Guerrier (1868\u20131943), who became a schoolteacher, worked also as a translator."

Guerrier's concern for the education of women was primarily with training good conversationalists, mothers, and schoolteachers, and he advised one new class to avoid politics. He showed a paternalistic attitude towards women, long after they had shown they could master university-level courses. However, after Tolstoy had refused to give graduates of the courses teaching rights, in 1876 and 1877 Guerrier petitioned the minister to change his mind, arguing that a growing number of unmarried women were without families to support them, so that there was an economic imperative for employment rights for such women. At one point there was controversy about Guerrier among the kursistki, as the female students were known. The cry went up \"Let's catcall Guerrier!\" after it had been alleged that as director of the Higher Courses he had treated women \"like an Oriental despot\". This charge, described in Guerrier's defence as \"an absurd and malicious slander\", caused a bitter division between two rival groups of women known as the 'politicians' and the 'academics'.Lewis Samuel Feuer, The conflict of generations: the character and significance of student movements (1969), p. 142"

In the 1870s, Russian liberals like Guerrier and Chicherin accused Karl Marx of being narrowly concerned with the proletariat and indifferent to the entrepreneur's more important \"psychic labour\". From 1876 Guerrier was active in the Moscow City Duma, making social welfare his special field of expertise. He was seen as a member of the \"educated\" group of members, and on one occasion remarked witheringly on the petty bourgeois members' habits of \"bowing humbly to eminent merchants\", \"preferring silence in debates\", and \"voting as their leaders told them\". He was a member of the Grot Commission on help for the destitute and a founder of 'Guardianship of Work Relief'. In 1894 he was elected to chair a committee responsible for the welfare of the poor. In 1903, Guerrier and a colleague named Popov, as members of the City Duma, proposed that binding regulations were needed to control the exploitation of waiters and other catering staff by their employers. After the Russian Constitution of 1906 came into effect, six members of the State Council of Imperial Russia were to be elected to it by the Russian Academy of Sciences, and Guerrier was one of those the Academy appointed that year."

Hardres was the son of Thomas Hardres of Canterbury. He was educated at Wadham College, Oxford. Hardres was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Canterbury in 1705 and sat to 1708. He was elected again in 1710 and held the seat until 1722. In 1711, Hardres required an Act of Parliament in order to \"sell certain Lands, in the County of Kent, and for settling of others to the Uses therein mentioned\". Hardres' political views were considered ambiguous. He voted against the government, except on the Peerage Bill which he supported and received money through Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland from the King's bounty in 1721. He also appeared to be a Jacobite, and his name was among those sent to the Pretender in 1721 as a likely supporter in the event of a rising. However, he retired in 1722 before he had to declare his views. Hardres died aged 82, leaving 2 surviving daughters."

Vedernikov became music director of the Bolshoi Theatre in 2001, where he worked on modernising the company. He conducted the first new production of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov since 1948. He conducted at the house the first production of Cilea's Adriana Lecouvreur in 2002, Mussorgsky's Khovanshchina, Puccini's Turandot, the original version of Glinka's Ruslan and Ludmila, the first production of Prokofiev's The Fiery Angel in 2004, the first Russian performance of the original version of Wagner's The Flying Dutchman and Verdi's Falstaff. He conducted, on a commission from the opera house, the world premiere of Leonid Desyatnikov's The Children of Rosenthal in the 2004/05 season. He led productions of Prokofiev's War and Peace and his ballet Cinderella. He had a contract with the company until 2010, but in July 2009 resigned on the first day of the theater's summer tour, citing disagreements with its management. Vedernikov made his Covent Garden debut in 1996, where he conducted Prokofiev's Cinderella and Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. He conducted at the Komische Oper Berlin Smetana's The Bartered Bride, Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades, Salome by Richard Strauss and Janacek's The Cunning Little Vixen. At the Paris Opera, he conducted Boris Godunov in 2005, directed by Francesca Zambello. He led Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 2011. He conducted a double bill of Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana and Leoncavollo's Pagliacci at the Opernhaus Z\u00fcrich in 2011, and made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, again with Eugene Onegin. In 2013, he conducted Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring with the BBC Orchestra in a centenary concert at the Barbican in London. A critic noted that he \"supplied his own wild-man choreography on the podium\". Vedernikov became chief conductor of the Odense Symphony Orchestra in 2009, with an initial three-year contract, which was extended to 2014. In November 2016 the Royal Danish Opera announced Vedernikov's appointment as its next chief conductor, effective from the 2018/19 season. Vedernikov concluded his Odense tenure in 2018, remaining an honorary conductor. In February 2019, he also became music director and principal conductor of the Mikhailovsky Theatre. Vedernikov died on 29 October 2020, from COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia."

        "content": "Amy Elise Horrocks (23 February 1867 \u2013 1919) was an English music educator, composer and pianist. She was born to English parents (Francis James Horrocks 8 July 1829 \u2013 27 April 1913) and Hannah Horrocks (n\u00e9e Allen 1833 \u2013 22 April 1913) in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and in 1882 studied piano and composition at the Royal Academy of Music with Adolf Schl\u00f6sser and Francis William Davenport. She won the Potter Exhibition prize in 1888 and the Bennett Prize in 1889. After completing her studies, she performed as a pianist and taught music in London. There are claims that she was proposed to by Sir Henry Wood, whom she turned down. One of her compositions, Romaunt of the Page, had its premiere at one of the Promenade Concerts on 6 October 1899. She eventually married Nicholas Paramythioti (1871\u20131943) a businessman from Corfu, on 22 August 1903, one of many lodgers at the house in Hampstead (17 Goldhurst Terrace)  that the family used to let rooms to.  Around this time she and Nicholas moved to France (where her two children were born, John in 1904 and Pamela in 1906) and she divided her time between France and Margate (where her parents had retired to and where they are both buried, having succumbed to the influenza epidemic, dying within a few days of each other in 1913). She kept a diary, (which spans the years 1907 to 1918)  which she wrote as a sort of \u2018life-guidance manual\u2019 for her two children. These few entries give an insight into her opinions about music and composition."

New's research has focused on legislation that restricts abortion. His secondary research area is on tax-limitation amendments, such as Colorado's Taxpayer Bill of Rights. His studies have been widely cited by pro-life groups, to argue for the effectiveness of various types of state level laws restricting abortion rights, including informed consent laws, parental involvement laws, and public funding restrictions. His research has also been used to validate Presidential platforms for and against abortion restrictions.  His studies have also been used by pro-life groups to encourage former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani to support abortion restrictions, and to challenge claims by former DNC Chair Howard Dean.  As well, his studies on tax limitation amendments have been used by both supporters of California's Proposition 13 and supporters of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights fiscal limit in Colorado. New is an adjunct scholar at the CATO Institute, and is a fellow at the Witherspoon Institute. He has also worked for the pro-life group Americans United for Life and is a Research Associate at Reproductive Research Audit. His research has also been published by the Heritage Foundation and the Family Research Council. New is also a regular commentator at National Review Online.

In or around 1868, Burn took him into partnership and when Burn died on 15 February 1870 Anderson took over the practice and Burn's house at 6 Stratton Street Piccadilly. Although he designed the Sailors\u2019 Home in Bombay in 1869, Anderson continued the exclusively country house nature of Burn\u2019s practice but from the early 1880s accepted a wider range of commercial and ecclesiastical business, particularly from Scottish clients, notably St Columba's church in Pont Street, London of which he was a member, the Headquarters of the London Scottish, Christie\u2019s Galleries, King Street, Lloyd\u2019s Bank, Coutts Bank and the British Linen Bank whose Threadneedle Street office he designed as late as 1913. All of these were directly commissioned. He was President of the Royal Institute of British Architects in  1891-94. He was also honorary architect to the Royal Scottish Hospital and Royal Caledonian Asylum. He died at Stratton Street on 9 June 1915. He had married Janet Crum of Thornliebank, Scotland and had three sons. His practice was continued by his middle son, Henry Lennox Anderson, born 1894, who studied at the Architectural Association and was taken into partnership in 1905."

Torrey was a great-grandson of Manasseh Cutler who had been a member of the United States Congress.  His father, Augustus Torrey, was a medical doctor.  Torrey was born in Beverly, Massachusetts.  He moved to the household of his uncle Joseph Torrey to go to Burlington High School.  He then studied at the University of Vermont, completing his bachelor's degree in 1858.  After teaching school for a time in Beverly, Massachusetts, he went to the Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York from which he graduated in 1864.  He was an ordained Congregational minister in Vergennes, Vermont until he was appointed to the faculty of the University of Vermont in 1868, taking on the Chair that had previously belonged to his uncle.  He also served as secretary of the University starting in 1871, the year the university began to admit women. A \"sound philosopher\", Torrey was an Intuitionist, as well as possessing a strong interest in Immanuel Kant, having \"cut his philosophical teeth\" on the Critique of Pure Reason. Nevertheless, Torrey did not follow any single philosophical system, and as a result he encouraged his students towards inquiry over the following of a particular approach. Torrey taught John Dewey both when Dewey was a student at the University of Vermont and later in one-on-one sessions, in particular when Dewey returned to Vermont in the early 1880s to teach in a private academy. This period of private tuition was a considerable influence on Dewey, as it was this period when Torrey pointed Dewey towards a career in philosophy. Torrey's interest in Kant and the emphasis he placed on Kant's writings in his teaching influenced Dewey's early work, as evidenced in Dewey's first four publications. In 1865 he married Sarah Paine Torrey, a daughter of his uncle Joseph Torrey, and thus his first cousin."

He then worked as a reporter and editor at the Houston Press. Thompson joined Life magazine in 1961 and became an editor and staff writer. While at Life he covered the JFK assassination and was the first writer to locate Lee Harvey Oswald's home and wife. Among his stories were coverage of the making of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by the Beatles, in which he revealed the group's extensive drug use; an in-depth look at Frank Sinatra and his alleged Mafia ties; and the 40th and 50th birthdays of Elizabeth Taylor. His book Hearts (1971) concerned the rivalry between Houston surgeons Michael DeBakey and Denton Cooley at the dawn of the heart transplant era.  Richie: The Ultimate Tragedy Between One Decent Man and the Son He Loved (1973) was the story of a Long Island man who killed his drug-addicted son. This was made into a TV-movie called The Death of Richie. Thompson's most successful book, Lost! (1975), was his account of the true story of two men and one woman who were lost at sea after a storm in the Pacific. Thompson's Lost! was retold in the made-for-TV movie Lost! in 1986. Blood and Money (1976) was based on a true story of scandal and the murders of Houston socialite Joan Robinson Hill and her husband John Hill, and the alleged involvement of Mrs. Hill's father, Ash Robinson, a wealthy Texas oil magnate. The book sold four million copies in fourteen languages. There were three lawsuits against Thompson after the book's publication.  Ann Kurth, John Hill's second wife, sued Thompson for his description of her as a \"sex bomb\". Kurth's suit and that of a Longview, Texas police officer, were both dismissed. Ash Robinson, the father of Joan Robinson Hill, also sued Thompson for his portrayal in the book; Robinson was unsuccessful in his suit against Thompson. Robinson had been allowed to read the book prior to its publication and initially said he approved of what Thompson had written about him.  His only criticism was that he believed the book was too long.  Thompson's publishers withheld his royalties until all suits connected with the book were settled. Thompson also wrote Serpentine (1979), the story of convicted murderer Charles Sobhraj. Thompson wrote one novel, Celebrity (1982), which was on the national best-seller list for six months.  That novel became the basis for a five-hour mini series in 1984. Thompson received the National Headliner Award for investigative reporting.  He was also the 1977 Edgar Award winner for Blood and Money. Thompson's family believed that the liver disease that caused his death was contracted in the Far East while investigating the Charles Sobhraj saga.  When he became ill, Thompson was teaching writing at the University of Southern California. Among his survivors were two sons, Kirk and Scott."

        "content": "McQuade was an assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Michigan from 1998 until becoming U.S. Attorney in that same district. She was also a professor of law at University of Detroit Mercy School of Law from 2003 to 2009. McQuade was appointed by President Barack Obama and started her term as U.S. Attorney on January 4, 2010. Upon taking office in January 2010, McQuade restructured the office for the first time in more than 35 years to align attorney resources with the priorities of the district: national security, violent crime, public corruption, civil rights and financial fraud, mortgage fraud, health care fraud, and environmental crimes. Significant case accomplishments during McQuade's tenure include the conviction of former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick on public corruption charges; the conviction and life sentence of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the would-be al-Qaeda bomber behind the 2009 Christmas Day bomb plot to destroy an airplane in flight from the Netherlands to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport; the conviction of a former Michigan Supreme Court justice on bank fraud charges; and the convictions of former employees for stealing trade secrets from Detroit automakers. McQuade also joined with other law enforcement leaders to launch Detroit One, a violence reduction strategy and community partnership. McQuade served on the Attorney General's Advisory Committee and was the co-chair of the Terrorism and National Security Subcommittee. She also served on subcommittees addressing civil rights and border security. She was the first woman to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. She served as deputy chief of the National Security Unit, where she prosecuted cases involving terrorism financing, foreign agents, export violations, and threats. During her career as a federal prosecutor, McQuade prosecuted cases involving violent crime, fraud, and racketeering. She helped expose Detroit-area cancer specialist Farid Fata as the mastermind of one of the largest health care frauds in American history. Fata pleaded guilty to his crimes in 2015 and was sentenced to 45 years in prison. In 2017, McQuade became a regular contributor to MSNBC, commenting primarily on purported scandals related to President Donald Trump."

She is known for her experimental avant-garde stylistic approach in cinema. In many of her works she experiments with the intersection of documentary and avant-garde. Bromberg's work in the Hollywood industry of optical effects allowed her to carry over technical and problem solving skills to her experimental work without detriment to its avant-garde themes. Additionally, her experimental film works have all been shot in 16mm, an analog medium which Bromberg says she will work with until \"either I'm done or it's done,\" in reference to the dominance of digital filmmaking in Hollywood. The style of Bromberg's experimental films is described as slowly evolving into the abstract, consciously free of the special effects of her industry career, and evocative of \"a retrieval of a kind of visual innocence.\" Bromberg's use of light and the transformation of the movement of light over time is the basis of her filmmaking and can be seen throughout her works."

Hawkins graduated in 1950 from the University of Washington with a degree in English.  He married Kathleen Marie Gallaner and worked for Boeing (as did Pynchon) in the early fifties, then in Beaumont, Texas in television, for station KFDM, and in advertising.  In 1960, Hawkins moved to San Francisco to join the Beats, supporting himself as a postal worker. After his work was rejected by local Beat publications, he took to self-publishing under the name \"Tiger Tim\" Hawkins. As a fan of William Gaddis, Hawkins discovered newspaper, the self-published Gaddis fansheet of \"jack green\". He became convinced that green was Gaddis, a detail that would show up in the Tinasky letters. Tinasky also claimed, \"The novels of William Gaddis and Thomas Pynchon were written by the same person\". After Hawkins retired, he and Kathleen moved to Mendocino County just outside Fort Bragg, where they lived in poverty for most of the eighties. Hawkins engaged in petty scams and thefts, and took to disguising himself. Kathleen came into an inheritance and bought a car for herself and a pickup truck for her husband. She also bought a kiln, and began a promising career in pottery."

These letters were later collected and published as The Letters of Wanda Tinasky. In them, Tinasky weighs in on a variety of topics \u2013 most notably local artists, writers, poets and politicians \u2013 with an irreverent wit and literate polish at odds with her apparently straitened circumstances. The harshness of the attacks was deemed excessive by the Commentary early on, and, as a result, most of the remaining letters appeared in the AVA. At the time, the identity of Tinasky was completely unknown, and subject to much local speculation. Tinasky was thought by many to be Thomas Pynchon, but is now widely believed to be Tom Hawkins."

Indeed, this event didn't altogether stem the flow of Tinasky's invective: at least one \"copycat\" letter, by Foster's account, had been published while Hawkins was alive, and these continued to trickle out for a short time after his death."

        "content": "Using textual analysis, Foster made a strong case that Hawkins was Wanda Tinasky from Hawkins' printed works. From 1962 through 1964, Hawkins published Freak, a fanzine that he printed with a mimeograph machine under the aegis of his own Ahab Press. In 1963, Hawkins (as \"Tiger Tim Hawkins\") self-published a paperback book that sold for $1 entitled Eve, the Common Muse of Henry Miller & Lawrence Durrell, that also addressed Gaddis and green. Hawkins insisted that Gaddis and green were the same person. In the Tinasky letters, Hawkins continued to insist that Gaddis and green were one and the same, and also claimed that Gaddis/green had written the works of Pynchon. In 1986, Hawkins as Tinasky again claimed that jack green \"...did pretty well in the auctorial line with novels published commercially under the names of William Gaddis & Thomas Pynchon.\" Foster also came across a 1964 second edition of a polemic Hawkins (as \"Tim Hawkins\") had published against Paul Krassner, publisher of The Realist, entitled Paul Krassner, The Realist, & $crap: Plus a P.S. on it. The ampersand and the \"P.S.\" were evocative of the Tinasky letters. Foster's case for Hawkins being Wanda Tinasky was sealed when the person who had bought Hawkins' former home sent Foster correspondence, personal papers and news clippings she had found."

Around 1898, Ward traveled to Paris where she created the Boy and Frog sculpture that was later awarded a medal at the 1904 St. Louis Worlds Fair. Before moving back to Denver in 1900, Ward also entered a piece for an exhibition at the Society of American Artists in Paris. At the request of her previous mentor, Augustus St. Gaudens, Ward began work at his studio in Cornish, New Hampshire. Ward produced a number of her works at this point in her life, including Mother and Child and The Huguenot, both prize-winning pieces in the Charleston Exposition in 1902. After her mentor, St. Gaudens died in 1907, Ward finished many of the pieces he was commissioned to create including the Baker Memorial in Mount Kisco, New York and a monument for Marcus A. Hanna in Cleveland, Ohio. Additionally, \"Ward was responsible for much of the work on the sculpture, Seated Lincoln (1897-1906) and the Baker tomb (1906-7).\" Ward then moved back to Denver, Colorado and married her husband, Henry Hering, in 1910. After she married Henry, Elsie Ward took his last name and became Elsie Ward Hering. \"After her marriage to Henry Hering in 1910, she seldom worked independently but assisted her husband on his projects.\" Ward continued to create art pieces after leaving the St. Gaudens studio. One of her last known works is a baptismal font that was finished in 1917 and was erected in St. George's Church in New York City.  \"Until her death in 1923, she was a deserving sculptor of statues great and small, including portraits and statues for public spaces.\" Following her death in Manhattan, New York in 1923, Ward was survived by her two siblings, Margaret and Ethelbert Ward as well as Major R.T. Ward of the United States army, Reverend Talbot Ward, and William F. Ward."

In the years 1915-1916 he studied philosophy at the University of Vienna, and in the years 1919-1922 at Jagiellonian University in agriculture. In the years 1922-1929 he published work on the Polish pony (Badania nad konikiem polskim z okolic Bi\u0142goraja and Dalsze badania nad konikiem polskim). He is credited with introducing the term \"Polish pony\" or Polish konik into the hippological literature in the mid-1920s.Zbigniew Jaworski of the Polish Academy of Sciences says that \"based on his research and observations, he hypothesized that a forest variety of the tarpan (Equus cab. gmelini Ant., forma silvatica Vet.) had split off from the populations living in the steppes of Eastern Europe and had survived into the mid 18th century in the lands of Poland, Lithuania, and Prussia.\" In 1926, Vetulani received a doctoral degree in agriculture at the Jagiellonian University. Three years later he obtained his degree of associate professor in animal husbandry. From 1931 to 1935 he worked as an associate professor and head of the Department of Animal Breeding at the Stefan Batory University in Vilnius. In February 1936, he founded a reserve and restoration scheme in Bialowieza Forest involving the breeding of Polish koniks, putting his early hypothesis to practice. Helmut Hemmer says that \"Tadeusz Vetulani purchased animals with particularly high resemblance to tarpans and subjected them to a selection programme carried out in the Institute for Genetics and Animal Breeding of the Polish Academy.\" From 1938, Vetulani was co-editor of the German journal \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Z\u00fcchtungsbiologie.\" In 1939 he represented Poland in Z\u00fcrich in an international conference on breeding. During World War II Vetulani lived in Krak\u00f3w, working as a clerk in the Polish Red Cross from 1940-1943. He was a spokesperson for the organization against the occupation authorities. He also aided in the care of Polish prisoners of war. Vetulani rejected all proposals for collaboration with the Nazis and also refused to join the committee appointed to audit the Katyn graves, not wanting to serve the German propaganda. Between 1945-1952 worked in restoration and increasing the breeding of the Polish pony. In 1949 he received the full title of Professor of Animal Husbandry. On June 5, 1949 he married Marie Godlewska. Their son Zygmunt was born in 1950. Tadeusz Vetulani died of a heart attack on February 24, 1952. He had fainted while working in a laboratory in Krakow during a scientific trip, and died the same day. He was buried at the Rakowicki Cemetery."

He received his A.B. and M.A. (1957) degrees from Loyola University of Chicago, and a Ph.D. in English Literature from Fordham University in 1970. Phillips was a member of the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits), and was ordained a priest in 1965. His decision to become a Jesuit at age 17 was strongly affected by his viewing of the film The Keys of the Kingdom (1944) as a boy. Since 1970 Phillips had taught at Loyola University of Chicago. He had written or edited more than 20 books on filmmakers and film (see bibliography); several of these have been reviewed by major newspapers. Phillips had served on juries at the Cannes, Berlin, and Chicago International Film Festivals. He had been a member of the editorial board for the journal Literature/Film Quarterly since its founding in 1973; this journal claims to be \"the longest standing international journal devoted to the study of adaptation\" (i.e. the adaptation of literature to film).  Phillips had been a prolific author of biographical books on filmmakers, and had published extended interviews with many filmmakers including Alfred Hitchcock,  Stanley Kubrick, Fritz Lang, and Joseph Losey. He was also a friend, champion and consultant for director Ken Russell, and author of the book Ken Russell (Twayne Publishers, 1979). Phillips was a consultant for The Devils (Russell, 1971) and famously defended the film against charges of blasphemy saying, in the documentary Hell On Earth - The Desecration and Resurection of The Devils (Mark Kermode, 2002), that the film depicts blasphemy, although it is not itself blasphemous."

He was a graduate of the University of Michigan where he played college football for the 1879 Michigan Wolverines football team, the first football team to represent the University of Michigan. Campbell was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1858.  His father James V. Campbell was a New York native who came to Detroit at age three in 1826.  His father was a regent and law professor at the University of Michigan and a member of the Michigan Supreme Court.  His mother Cornelia (Hotchkiss) Campbell was also a native of New York. Campbell attended the public schools and high schools in Detroit, graduating in 1876.  He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1876 and completed \"the Latin and scientific course.\"  While studying at Michigan, Campbell played at the halfback position for the 1879 Michigan Wolverines football team, the first football team to represent the University of Michigan.  The first football game for the University of Michigan was a May 30, 1879, game against Racine at White Stockings field in Chicago.  Campbell took the opening kickoff in that first football game, a play described in a newspaper the next day as follows: The University team won the choice and let the Racine team have the kick.  Johnston made a fair kick which was caught by Campbell and carried forward some distance by good runs and skilled throwing to others of our team. Campbell was also a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity while at Michigan.  A notebook kept by Campbell while he was a student at Michigan from 1879 to 1880, which includes lecture notes from James B. Angell's courses in political economy and international law, is maintained in the collections of the University of Michigan's Bentley Historical Library.  Campbell received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree from the University of Michigan in 1880. Campbell studied law at the office of Alfred Russell starting in 1880, and was admitted to the Michigan Bar in 1882.  He went into practice with Russel at the firm of Russell & Campbell in 1886.  The firm later became known as Russell, Campbell & Bulkley (1905\u20131907), and later as Russell, Campbell, Bulkley & Ledyard (1907\u20131912), and eventually Campbell, Bulkley & Ledyard (after 1912).  Campbell specialized in conveyancing and trusts.  In his history of the City of Detroit, Clarence M. Burton wrote: \"For many years Mr. Campbell has been recognized as one of the most eminent members of the Michigan bar.\" Campbell was also active in Detroit's civic affairs.  In 1920, he was selected as the president of the Detroit Board of Commerce.  He also served as the secretary of the Woodlawn Cemetery Association, trustee of Detroit's famed Mariners' Church, treasurer and director of the River Rouge Improvement Co., and a member of the board of trustees of the Protestant Episcopal diocese of Michigan. In the 1910s, Campbell lived in the Pasadena Apartments, then one of the most fashionable apartment houses in Detroit.  Campbell never married.  At the time of the 1910 United States Census, Campbell lived in Apartment 148 at the Pasadena Apartments with his sister, Cornelia."

        "content": "Fraser Frisell (1774\u20131846), was a friend of Chateaubriand and Joubert. Frisell, of British, probably Scottish parentage, was educated at the University of Glasgow. He was in France, for the purpose of finishing his education, in 1793, when, in pursuance of the decree of the Convention for the arrest of strangers, he was thrown into prison at Dijon, where he remained for fifteen months. There he made the acquaintance of Mme. de Guitaut, whose hospitality he accepted until his return to England, after the signature of the Treaty of Amiens. He was again in France on the renewal of the war in 1803, and was again imprisoned, but not for long. Frisell now took up his residence at Paris, where he lived during the remainder of his life, spending, however, a portion of each year in travel, and in visits to Mme. de Guitaut and her husband at \u00c9poisses. He became the intimate friend of Chateaubriand, Joubert, Fontanes, and their circle. In memory of Frisell's daughter \u00c9lisa (or Louisa), who died at Passy in 1832 aged 17, Chateaubriand, while in prison on charge of participation in the Duchesse de Berry's attempt to overthrow the Orl\u00e9anist r\u00e9gime, composed the touching stanzas, Jeune Fille et Jeune Fleur, and portions of the affectionate correspondence between Frisell and Joubert have been preserved. He died while on a visit to England in February 1846. Frisell was a man of considerable accomplishments. Chateaubriand called him \"le Gr\u00e9co-Anglais\", and Count Marcellus, while styling him fantastic, testifies to his culture and knowledge. His manner is described as reserved and his conversation sarcastic, with an affectation of indifference which annoyed his friends, particularly Mme. de Chateaubriand; but he was generally beloved. The only work that he is known to have written is an \u00c9tude sur la Constitution de l'Angleterre, avec des remarques sur l'ancienne Constitution de la France, 1820."

During this period this team made significant contributions to psychiatry. The three main contributions are described below: First.  They have scientifically proven that depressions require different treatments depending on the specific type of depression, against the current trend driven by American psychiatry, and some psychiatrists in Spain. This trend does not distinguish differential treatment in all cases depression in the same manner and with the same drugs. They believe that it must be treated very differently the depressions of biological cause (endogenous) from depressions of psychological or social causes (neurotic or reactive).  Thus at the time defended the use of old tricyclics and MAOIs in atypical depression and endogenous, and now they prefer dual-action antidepressants in endogenous depression and antidepressant action of specific the neurotic or reactive depression (serotonin). Second.  They are critical of the excessive overvaluation of comorbidity (at least two different diseases in one patient) in psychiatry, which involves the therapist to make several different diagnostic and patient follow several different treatments. For this reason they identify the primary underlying pathology and treat it specifically. They tend to assess and treat a single disease and not a mixture of pathologies. Third.  They delved into the study and diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in line to differentiate this disease from others like: hair pulling (trichotillomania), fear of body deformation (BDD), etc. These conditions that resemble OCD reiteration, not genuine obsessions and, therefore, treatment should be different. This team has made numerous scientific publications in this field."

It is called Oxley Hall and is a three-story building constructed of brick and features an octagonal tower. It was built in the English Renaissance style with a Spanish tile roof, brick exterior and limestone trim. The cost of the original structure is listed as $66,490.85. Rector had studied with then-Ohio State University architect Joseph Bradford. Her work was so good that Bradford suggested her to the board of trustees as the architect for the first women\u2019s dorm on campus. She was 25 years old. She got the job, although the trustees assigned her a male partner, Wilbur T. Mills. In a 1970 Columbus Dispatch interview, Rector said that she became fed up with Mills, locked him out of the office, and submitted her final plans for approval within the month. So what we see today is Florence Kenyon Hayden Rector\u2019s vision, although both she and Mills are listed as the official architectural team. Residents moved into the building in September 1908 and took a vote on what to name their new home. The board of trustees accepted their recommendation, and on November 20, 1908, officially named the building for university president William Oxley Thompson's mother (her maiden name, which is where he got his middle name). The building served as a dormitory until 1967, when it was decided that it was unsuitable as a residence hall and was leased to the University Research Foundation. The building was remodeled in 1989, and in 1991 the Department of International Affairs moved in, where it remains to this day."

Another design of Rector's is an arts and crafts style house that was built at 1277 East Broad Street in Columbus.

The long, narrow home she designed for herself is a stuccoed two-and-a-half story structure. With its gable end to the street, the house is modest and has an asymmetrical front facade. It combines French doors, small rectangular windows, round-headed windows, and steel casements in an eclectic and very personal design.

Willimon attended John Burroughs School, where he took drama classes taught by Jon Hamm and graduated in 1995. He majored in history and visual arts and received a BA from Columbia University in 1999. When he was an undergraduate, he met Jay Carson. In 1998, he worked as a volunteer and intern for the Senate campaign of Charles Schumer, which led to jobs with Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign, Bill Bradley's 2000 presidential campaign, and Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign. After graduating, he worked for the ministry of the interior for the Estonian government in Tallinn as part of a fellowship, during which he sorted through and wrote summaries of thousands of pages of E.U.-related documents. Shortly after, he moved to Vietnam to work for a small cultural magazine, and there did research for his first screenplay, based on the life of Tomas Vu, a visual arts professor at Columbia who grew up in Vietnam during the war. He returned to New York to attend Columbia's School of the Arts. One of his mentors was playwright Eduardo Machado. Willimon said, \"I was the worst student by far in our group. A lot of these people had known they wanted to be playwrights forever. I didn't know a soul in the theater world, and I didn't have the faintest idea how to truly write a play. But I quit drinking then and really committed myself to this path.\" During graduate school, he received a visual arts scholarship for a proposal to create 40 lithographs about paranoia, and lived in South Africa for a year. After receiving an MFA in Playwriting from the School of the Arts in 2003, he worked in odd jobs, including gallery and painter's assistant, set builder, finding jobs for the homeless, barista, and an instructor teaching SAT prep classes. He also did an internship with New Dramatists. Willimon subsequently enrolled at the Juilliard School's Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Program, receiving both the Lila Acheson Wallace Juilliard Playwriting Fellowship and the Lincoln Center Le Compte du Nuoy Award."

        "content": "At Juilliard, he wrote a play, Farragut North, that was inspired by his experience as press aide for Dean's 2004 campaign for President. In fall 2008, it premiered off Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company in a production starring John Gallagher Jr., Chris Noth, and Olivia Thirlby. The production received a Los Angeles run the following summer, with Chris Pine in the starring role. Concurrently it received a production at the Contemporary American Theater Festival at Shepherd University in July 2009. Willimon was nominated in 2009 for the John Gassner Award by the Outer Critics Circle. Other plays include Lower Ninth, produced in 2007 by the SPF and The Flea Theater in 2008; Zusammenbruch, produced in 2008 at the American Airlines Theater and directed by Thomas Kail; Spirit Control, produced in 2010 by the Manhattan Theatre Club; The Parisian Woman, produced in 2013 by South Coast Repertory; and Breathing Time, produced in 2014 by Fault Line Theater. Willimon's work has also been developed and performed at MCC Theater, Ars Nova, HERE Arts Center, the Phoenix Theatre, the Actors Theater of Chicago, Battersea Arts Centre in London, Cherry Lane Theatre, and the South Coast Repertory. A film adaption of Farragut North, retitled The Ides of March, premiered in October 2011. The movie was directed by George Clooney; the script was written by Willimon, Clooney and his producing partner, Grant Heslov. It starred Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Evan Rachel Wood, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Marisa Tomei, and Jeffrey Wright. The film was nominated in 2012 for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and for four Golden Globe Awards, including Best Picture \u2013 Drama and Best Screenplay. In September 2017, Willimon was elected for a two-year term as President of the Writers Guild of America, East, running unopposed. He was re-elected without opposition in 2019. Hulu gave a straight-to-series order to The First in May 2017 (co-produced with Channel 4). It debuted in 2018, but was not renewed for a second season. The show portrays members of a team of astronauts as they become the first humans to visit Mars. In 2019, as WGA-E President, Willimon oversaw the negotiating committee for the \"WGA-Agency Agreement\", and joined other WGA members in firing his agents as part of the guild's stand against the ATA after the two sides were unable to come to an agreement on a new \"Code of Conduct\" that addressed the practice of packaging. In 2021, he signed a first look deal with Entertainment One."

        "content": "In 2012, Willimon developed House of Cards,  the American adaption of the BBC series of the same name, for Netflix. It was produced by Media Rights Capital, David Fincher, and Kevin Spacey, and for five seasons starred Spacey as ruthless politician Frank Underwood and Robin Wright as his equally scheming wife Claire. The series also stars Kate Mara, Corey Stoll, Michael Kelly, Neve Campbell, Michel Gill, Jayne Atkinson, Sebastian Arcelus and Lars Mikkelsen. It premiered on Netflix on February 1, 2013. Willimon served as the series' showrunner for its first four seasons, stepping down in January 2016. House of Cards premiered its sixth and final season on November 2, 2018. On November 3, 2017, Netflix fired Spacey from House of Cards and cut all ties with the actor following several allegations of sexual misconduct. Several crew members on the House of Cards set accused Spacey of sexually harassing them. When the accusations first surfaced in late October of that year, Willimon released a statement saying, \"During the time I worked with Kevin Spacey on House of Cards, I neither witnessed nor was aware of any inappropriate behavior on set or off\". However, three House of Cards crew members have disputed that assertion, commenting anonymously in a Buzzfeed News article that Willimon was aware of Spacey's behavior, including an incident during the show's first season in which Spacey allegedly sexually assaulted a production assistant, and took no action against the actor. A \"higher-level source\" for the article alleged that Willimon witnessed Spacey behaving inappropriately. Willimon denied witnessing or knowing about the alleged assault, but said, \u201cI am heartsick that anyone on the crew had to endure this sort of behavior. Clearly we as an industry, particularly those in a position of power, myself included, need to be more perceptive and proactive. We also need to do a better job at empowering and supporting our colleagues who come forward.\u201d"

        "content": "Sinta Tantra (born 11 November 1979) is a British artist of Balinese descent. She was born in New York on 11 November 1979, and spent her childhood in Indonesia, America and the UK. She graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art, London, in 2003 and completed her postgraduate degree at Royal Academy of Arts in 2006. In the same year, she was awarded the prestigious Deutsche Bank Award in Fine Art. Highly regarded for her site-specific work in the public realm, she has since undertaken commissions that include the Folkestone Triennial (2017), Songdo Tech City (2016), Liverpool Biennial (2012), The Southbank Centre (2008), and TFL Art on the Underground (2007). She held the inaugural Bridget Riley Fellowship 2016\u201317 at the British School at Rome, is the recipient of the British Council\u2019s International Development Award and was shortlisted for the Jerwood Painting Prize. She lives and works between London and Bali. Tantra\u2019s practice is diverse, ranging from painted canvases, to site-specific sculptural interventions, to large-scale public artworks. She describes her work as 'painting on an architectural scale'. Colour is central to her practice, as a 'material which lies between the language of art and industry'. Her distinctive palette is inspired by her Balinese heritage and childhood holidays: 'I remember things through colour \u2013  especially the way in which colours vibrate against each other. I like the idea of \u2018colour semiotics\u2019 and the associations one has to particular colours in relationship to either brand or narrative.' Her work has been described as \"exuberant\", a \"hedonistic celebration of excess and decoration\", and her contribution to public art by transforming spaces with \"chaotic yet captivating images\" has been recognised by collectors and commissioners alike. Her 2010 work Universe of Objects in Archive, Arsenic and Railings praised for lifting the perspective \"like the energy of a released spring and pulses horizontally around the room in endless optical trigonometric fugue\"."

        "content": "Tantra was born on 11 November 1979, in New York, to Balinese parents. Her father worked in finance, while her mother looked after her and her four older siblings. When Tantra was aged 6, the family relocated to the UK. Tantra has said, 'Like many first generation children whose parents migrated, I could never really identify with being from just one particular place. My work explores my identity and the layering of cultures specific to my own experiences. I am inspired by the colours of Bali, an English Heritage palette and 1980s pop Americana.' After completing a BTEC diploma in Fine Art at Middlesex University in 1999, Tantra took her BA at the Slade School of Fine Art from 2000 to 2003, under the tutor Andrew Stahl, head of Painting. It was here that she met the sculptor Nick Hornby, who she would go on to collaborate with in the future. During her studies, Tantra was introduced to the work of the conceptual artist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007), whose reduction of painting to a 'series of instructions or blueprints' she cites as a \u2018huge\u2019 and enduring influence on her practice. Like LeWitt, Tantra's work lies at the intersection between art and architecture, exceeding the confines of the canvas and of the gallery space. Likewise, Tantra cites the Indonesian painter Mochtar Apin (1923-1944) as an inspiration: 'In my work, there are specific elements inspired by Indonesian patterns. These patterns are reduced, distorted or enlarged to such a scale that the viewer becomes submerged in the decoration itself.' After graduating, Tantra was accepted onto the Royal Academy Fine Art Masters Programme. Her studies were funded by a Paul Smith Postgraduate Scholarship. It was at the RA that Tantra's interest in large-scale artwork in the public realm began. She regards this as a reaction both to the stereotype of female work as modest or decorative. 'Even at art school, painting on canvas didn't really appeal to me- I was more interested in playing with architectural space, injecting colour, line, and form into new environments. Admittedly in the early days, there was also the desire to challenge the gender stereotype, that both men and women could make large scale works.' She describes the expectation of her lecturers and peers that she would create 'something cute and feminine, in small sizes' as fuelling her desire to \u2018consistently create abstract and structured paintings\u2019."

        "content": "Tantra completed her MA in 2006, and that year was awarded the prestigious Deutsche Bank award. She began running a studio space for artists in the London Borough of Camden, organising workshops and community projects. Through her work she made contact with Camden Council, who commissioned her first public art piece, a mural stretching across Regents Park Bridge titled Isokon Dreams (2007). The work was praised by the local Councillor Flick Rea, who said 'The mural is fantastic. It really brightens the [Regents Park Road] bridge'. Tantra's early work was composed of intricately cut vinyl and painted designs, featuring vibrant colours and geometric shapes. Her work remains recognisable for its distinctive use of colour and pattern: clean lines, geometric abstraction, a preoccupation with decorative symbols, and a bold and arresting choice of colours. Among her first commissions was a 2006 project for Transport For London\u2019s Art on the Underground initiative, for which she produced a vinyl installation at the exit of Piccadilly Circus Station. Other early projects include a large mural and stage for the Saison Poetry Library in the Southbank Centre, titled A Good Time and a Half! (2007). Poet Lemn Sissay described it as an 'incredible piece of work', which 'allows for the full breadth of human experience upon the stage [...] brings the entire world into the library'. Since then Tantra has gone on to make increasingly ambitious works, including her painting across the length of the DLR Bridge in Canary Wharf titled A Beautiful Sunset Mistaken for a Dawn, which was commissioned by Canary Wharf Group in anticipation of the 2012 Olympics. Other projects include an installation at the Open Eye Gallery as part of the 2012 Liverpool Biennial. 2013 saw the first of a series of collaborative projects with the sculptor Nick Hornby. Collaborative Works was held in the lobby of the One Canada Square building. This featured Hornby\u2019s marble sculptures overlaid with Tantra\u2019s trademark colour abstractions, as well as maquettes for larger sculptures drawing on Tantra\u2019s colour compositions. The exhibition was described as a \u2018a radical development\u2019 in both their careers. Of public art, Tantra has said: 'There's a sort of \"constructivist\" approach to the entire process which I like [...] there are the practicalities of making the work itself whilst giving the artwork a \"social function\"'. She feels that her Balinese heritage has affected her work less in its appearance than in the way that art 'is embedded in life- which is what public art does- and the idea of working together with people [...] I guess that it is like a celebration'. Tantra has held a number of artists residencies, including a 2014 residency with Cemeti Art House and Mes 56 in Yogyakarta, one of the largest creative communities in Indonesia. It was funded by Arts Council England and the British Council."

Since 1970, it is convention that an international artist be chosen to design the flag. Tantra united her contemporary design and colour palette with the compulsory elements: the Madonna of the Assumption, the City insignia (Terzi), and the symbols of each contrada participating in the race), as well as that year's commemoration for Giovanni Dupr\u00e8. \"For an abstract geometric artist, the biggest challenge was having to include figurative elements. For the Madonna of the Assumption, I represented the figure as a linear drawing based on an early renaissance painting I found by Ambrogio Lorenzetti. The sculpture of Sappho by Giovanni Dupr\u00e8 on the other hand, was based on drawing illustrations by Andy Warhol from the 1950s- I wanted to add a layer of 'pop art' and 1950s nostalgia into the work\"."

Inspired by the diversity of Tontine Street's migrant residents, Tantra took visual cues from an eclectic mix of sources. The fluid lines and spliced circles flanking one side of the building are a gesture to the colour patterns of Sonia Delaunay (1885-1979). The work's title, and its colours (candy pink, racing green and Wedgewood blue) were lifted from a poster from 1947 advertising rail travel to Folkestone.[26] She says \u2018I wanted to inject some of that [advert\u2019s] romance into the intervention\u2019. Tantra has said that the aim of the work was \"to make the building fizz\". \"I wanted to have a retro feel, because I was thinking of Folkestone as a seaside town\", she says. \"I was thinking about post-war Britain and what that meant, and the idea of holidays, because after the war it was obviously quite difficult.\" Design Historian Dr. Paul Rennie of Central St. Martins praised the work's \"evident simplicity, economy, and effectiveness [...] Sinta's made a pig-ugly 1970s building disappear into plain view!\" Rennie remarked that passersby were afforded \"completely different experiences of the building as it shape-shifts in relation to movement. The direct appeal to feeling derived from both colour and movement is irresistible...and provides a nice contrast to the prevailing over-complication of much contemporary [art].\""

Commissioned by Canary Wharf Group for the 2012 Olympics, The 300 metre-long painted mural features on both sides of the DLR bridge that stretches across the Thames in London's Docklands Waterfront. The work was inspired by the high-rise silhouettes of Canary Wharf, and by the ever-changing colours of sunrise and dusk. Sinta explains, \"Time and space forms a peculiar concept in our modern world today. There is the working day, our relationship to technology juxtaposed with the nature and universe at large. Through the use of colour, scale and geometry, I wanted to create a painting which engaged the viewer at different times of the day and different times of the year; a piece of work which made you think about the surrounding architecture, the natural landscape and how we as bodies move along, around, above and beneath.\" Tantra's palette of muted pinks and blues was complemented by a lighting scheme by Lighting Design International. LED projectors under the bridge washed soft coloured light from end to end, which adapted to echo the transitions of sky from day to night. The painting required 5,000 litres of paint and over 3\u00a0km of specialist masking tape to achieve the clean, precise lines that Tantra is known for. As part of the project, Tantra recorded a 24-hour time lapse sequence that showed the sunset and sunrise over the bridge. It is part of Canary Wharf Group's Permanent Collection, alongside artists such as Lynn Chadwick, Bruce McLean, and Catherine Yass."

        "content": "In recent years, Tantra's practice has expanded to include painted canvases, and smaller sculptural interventions. These works are part of her ongoing interest in the relationship between physical and pictorial space, and her exploration of colour, pattern, weight and dimension. She has spoken of her preference for tempera paint: \"[it is] very similar to the finish of an Italian fresco; highly pigmented, very matt and has a brilliant lustre [\u2026] when you stare at it, its almost like 'falling' into the colour.\" Her artworks increasingly make use of historical and literary references and found objects, lifting colours and shapes from the 18th century architecture of John Nash to Hollywood films such as Breakfast at Tiffany's. Tantra's painting practice, like her public artwork,  strives to \"turn the white cube space inside out\". \"I want to create a feeling of total immersion, of diving into the colour and into the surface\", she explains. Bold geometric patterns and colours seek to create \"a more intimate relationship with what you see in front of you - an awareness of material and colour and the solidity between the two\". Tantra has had a number of international solo-shows. Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (2016) at Pearl Lam Galleries, Hong Kong, featured paintings that played with the relationship between the two-dimensional the three-dimensional. \"Her works define the clarity between the two but also finds endless ways of distorting it, questioning the relationship between painting and architecture\". Tantra's 2017 solo-show A House in Bali (ISA Art Advisory, Jakarta ) borrowed its title from the name of a Colin McPhee novel. The book depicts Bali as a place rich in culture, spiritual values and pleasure. As Tantra puts it: \"Growing up in London, my Balinese father daily played Gamelan music on the cassette player at home. For him, it was a way to transport himself back to the small village where he grew up and immerse himself in fond memories. In his book, McPhee writes about the relationship between the abstract and syncopated sounds of Gamelan music and how, like Jazz, the music is percussion led. In this new series of paintings, I wanted to draw a stronger focus on a sense of rhythm and how line and colour represents a sort of musical notation across the canvas.\""

He also contributes to the legal blog Crime and Consequences. In 2007, Otis wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post urging President George W. Bush to commute the prison sentence imposed on Scooter Libby, who had been sentenced to 30 months in prison, a $250,000 fine, and two years of probation for his role in the aftermath of the Valerie Plame affair. Approximately one month after Otis's piece appeared, Bush commuted Libby's prison sentence, while leaving the rest of the sentence intact. Otis spent much of his career as head of the Appellate Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.  For ten years, he was a member of the Attorney General's Advisory Subcommittee on the Sentencing Guidelines. In 1992, during the investigation into \"Iraqgate,\" he served as Special Counsel for President George H. W. Bush. He returned to the U.S. Attorney's Office the next year, and ended his tenure there in 1999. He returned to federal service three years later as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Energy. In 2003, he was appointed Counselor to the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, where he remained until 2007. Otis has appeared before both houses of the United States Congress as an expert witness on diverse subjects in criminal law including the death penalty, illegal drugs, and the United States Sentencing Commission. He has been interviewed on these and other subjects by The New York Times, The Atlantic magazine, CBS's 60 Minutes, The O'Reilly Factor, ABC News, and MSNBC. He has written op-ed pieces for various newspapers on topics including legal ethics, Miranda warnings, and the firing of U.S. Attorneys by then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales."

        "content": "On March 1, 2018, President Donald Trump nominated Otis to the United States Sentencing Commission. Otis' nomination was criticized by several advocacy groups for his support of existing mandatory sentencing laws, and his views on demographics and crime. In an earlier blog post, Otis had defended a speech given by Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones to an audience at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, observing that in the U.S., minorities commit more violence than whites. Otis contended that Jones' speech had been challenged as offensive but not as untrue. He stated that \"race and criminality have no causative relationship,\" and that the disproportionate commission of violent crime by blacks was a product of a breakdown in family structure, not an inherent characteristic, as the Washington Post had included in a headline it altered hours after being published. He supported his argument by pointing to the fact that persons of Asian descent (whom he described  as \"Orientals\") have lower crime rates than whites, even though Asians had been subjected to discrimination whites did not face. He said the lower crime rates of Asian-Americans, as opposed to white or black Americans, resulted from intact, two-parent families that honor \"work, education and tradition...values, not race or skin color, influence choices.\" Otis\u2019 nomination lapsed without action by the Senate."

His primary area of expertise was medieval English law and the relationship between royal and ecclesiastical jurisdictions. Graves was born in Philadelphia, where he attended the Penn Charter School and Haverford College. At Haverford, he studied with the eminent medievalist W. E. Lunt, who taught courses on English constitutional history and did pioneering research on papal financial records. Graves would maintain a close working relationship with Lunt for many years until the latter's death in 1956. Following graduation from Haverford, Graves continued on to Harvard where he completed a Ph.D. under the supervision of Charles Homer Haskins. From 1927 until his retirement in 1969, Graves taught history at Hamilton College in central New York state. His scholarship focused on a few select issues in English legal history, particularly the relationship between the Crown and ecclesiastical courts, including the papal rota. Later, he would see to completion the massive two-volume work begun by his mentor Lunt on papal finances in England. In 1975, Graves completed his magnum opus, a revised and updated edition of Charles Gross's Bibliography of English History to 1485 (Oxford). Graves died in 1983 and his papers were deposited at the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in Toronto. Friends and former students later established an endowed professorship in his memory in the Hamilton College history department."

In A Private Sphere (Polity 2010), she argued that digital technologies are changing the site of civic engagement to the private realm. She further develops this thesis in her book Affective Publics: Sentiment, Technology and Politics (Oxford University 2014), arguing that social movements sustained by digital media should not be defined by their political efficacy but rather by their affective intensities or how they help publics \"feel their way into\" an event or issue. Affective Publics won Best Book award for the Human Communication and Technology Division of the National Communication Association in 2015 and was praised by critics. Lilie Chouliaraki wrote that Affective Publics is \"a significant statement in its own right about the ontology of digital communication...introduced in the field by this groundbreaking work.\" She has also edited Routledge collections, A Networked Self and Birth, Life, Death: Routledge (2019), A Networked Self and Platforms, Stories, Connections: Routledge (2018), Identity, Community and Culture on Social Network Sites and Journalism and Citizenship: New Agendas (Routledge, 2009).

        "content": "Thom was born in Minonk, Illinois in 1872, the fifth of six boys. His parents were Angus Sutherland Thom and Louisa (Herick) Thom, Scottish/Irish farmers who had settled in Illinois shortly before the American Civil War. Charles Thom was raised in a strongly religious household; his father was an elder in the Presbyterian church. Thom upheld Presbyterian values throughout his life, kept active in church affairs, and became a staunch prohibitionist. His early years spent working on his father's farm instilled the value of a strong work ethic, and first-hand knowledge of agricultural practices that would prove useful in his later career. After graduating from high school, Thom attended Lake Forest Academy, a preparatory institution for college, in 1889. He earned a bachelor's degree from Lake Forest College in 1895. The next year he spent as a science teacher in a Danville high school, before returning to Lake Forest College to receive his Master's degree in 1897. In 1899, working under the supervision of Howard Ayers, he received his PhD from the University of Missouri on the topic of fertilization in the ferns Aspidium and Adiantum. This was the first doctorate awarded by that institution. Thom married Ethel Winifred Slater in 1906, with whom he had three children (one died during childbirth). Ethel Thom died in October 1942, shortly before his retirement. In 1944 he remarried, to Charlotte J.\u00a0Bayles, with whom he lived until her death. Thom died two years after Charlotte at his home in Port Jefferson, New York, on May 24, 1956."

        "content": "In 1902, Thom went to study with George F. Atkinson at Cornell University; two colleagues included Benjamin Duggar and Herbert Hice Whetzel, who both later became noted botanists. Two years later, he accepted a position as dairy mycologist, working with Herbert William Conn, in charge of \"cheese investigations\" at the Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station in Connecticut. He remained in this institution\u2014a branch of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)\u2014 holding various research and administrative positions, until his retirement in 1942. During his employment there, Thom investigated the process of cheese ripening and sought to understand the composition of the microbiological flora required for imparting certain flavors on cheeses. Through this work he isolated and identified the fungi Penicillium camemberti and Penicillium roqueforti. In 1914, Thom became the Chief of the Microbiological Laboratory at the USDA Bureau of Chemistry, where his job was to study problems with the handling and processing of foods, and to enforce the Pure Food and Drug Act, a United States federal law that mandated federal inspection of food products. Known for his dedication to maintaining high standards in the food industry, he relished arguing court cases \"in defense of sanitary practices in the handling and processing of perishable foods\". In one noted case involving the adulteration of tomato catsup, he presented partially rotten tomatoes to the jury, and, concluding his testimony, asked them \"Should the American people have to eat these in their catsup?\" Selman Waksman, who would later be another key contributor to antibiotic development, spent some months in 1915-1916 at the USDA in Washington, DC under Thom, studying soil fungi. Thom's work with the food chemist James N. Currie in 1916\u201317 enabled them to develop a process to mass-produce citric acid using Aspergillus, and a few years later, the first large-scale mold fermentation factory had been established in Brooklyn, New York. This early work ultimately led to the Department of Agriculture's establishing four Regional Research Laboratories in 1938 that were devoted to industrial mold fermentations. During his time at the USDA, Thom became a world authority on the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Thom pioneered the technique of using defined, reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms; most of the taxa he described are still valid today. Together with Margaret B. Church, Thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for the American Type Culture Collection, established in 1925. In 1929, a year after discovering penicillin, Alexander Fleming published a well-known paper in which he identified the mold Penicillium rubrum as the one responsible for creating the drug. Harold Raistrick succeeded in growing the organism on a simple culture medium, but could not isolate the penicillin produced by the mold when grown this way. With Thom's assistance, they correctly identified the organism as Penicillium notatum and, in 1941, developed a method to scale up production at the Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of the drug. Thom held his job with the Bureau of Chemistry until 1927, when the position was abolished. He was then appointed Principal Mycologist of the Division of Soil Microbiology for the newly created Bureau of Chemistry and Soils. In a few years, Thom became known as an authority on soil microbiology, and was often invited to present papers at national and international meetings. In one of Thom's important contributions to the field, he led the research group responsible for advances that enabled the control of cotton root rot, which at the time was a major problem in the southwestern United States. In collaboration with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Kenneth Raper, they published the Manual of Penicillin in 1940. Thom formally retired in 1942, although he remained active as a consultant and guest speaker until shortly before his death."

He attended graduate school in the Program in Comparative Tropical History at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, where he studied with Jan Vansina.  He received a Master of Arts in 1967 and a Doctor of Philosophy in history in 1972. His most important book was Way of Death: Merchant Capitalism and the Angolan Slave Trade, 1730-1830 , which won the Herskovits Prize of the African Studies Association in 1989. In an article shortly before his death, he described his scholarship as stemming froma commitment to bringing Africans respectfully into the mainstream of the history they share with the rest of us, and us with them. Over the years, that\u2019s extended to an effort to understand the experiences of enslavement on global scales \u2013 again, painting the larger picture, into which fit the Africans brought to the Americas. On a world scale, they were far from alone, and the seemingly unstoppable removals of people that enslavement means in turn tell us something about ourselves that we\u2019d all be better off recognizing.In addition to his monographs, Miller was a prolific editor.  He was an editor for the Journal of African History from 1990 to 1997 and edited multiple volumes each of the Encyclopedia of Africa South of the Sahara, the Macmillan Encyclopedia of World Slavery, and the New Encyclopedia of Africa. He also edited the 2015 Princeton Companion to Atlantic History and contributed entries on the Transatlantic Slave Trade to the Encyclopedia Virginia in 2018. Miller was treasurer of the African Studies Association from 1989 to 1993 and served as president of that organization in 2005 and 2006. He was president of the American Historical Association in 1998. In 2004 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship to study the world history of slavery. He was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2018, shortly before his death from cancer."

She was instrumental in the creation of the Canaveral National Seashore in 1975, and the Spruce Creek Preserve, renamed the Doris Leeper Spruce Creek Preserve in memoriam. She founded the Atlantic Center for the Arts in 1982. She was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 1999. Leeper was born on April 4, 1929, in Charlotte, North Carolina. She attended Duke University, originally intending to become a brain surgeon \u2013 the origin of her nickname \"Doc.\" She eventually graduated in 1951 with a degree in art history. In 1958, while working in the field of commercial art, she moved to the small community of Eldora, Florida, situated on a barrier island between New Smyrna Beach and Titusville, Florida. As a result of her presence there, Leeper became increasingly interested in environmental preservation. By 1961, she had become a full-time artist, specializing in painting and sculpture. Her work is in over 100 collections in the U.S. and abroad. By the early 1970s, Leeper was a well-known figure in the Florida environmental movement, and was instrumental in the 1975 creation of the Canaveral National Seashore (CANA), which encompassed the island on which Eldora was located. In 1975 she founded Friends of Canaveral and appointed to the Canaveral National Seashore Advisory Commission where she pushed for wilderness protection for the seashore. Leeper conceived of the Atlantic Center for the Arts in 1977, envisioning it as a Florida artist-in-residence program in which artists of all disciplines could work with current prominent artists in a supportive and creative environment. Leeper saw the potential for an artist's residency as a place for ideas to be created, shared, and come into fruition. She soon persuaded friends and community members to join in her vision. In 1979, she convinced the Rockefeller Foundation to provide a challenge grant that soon was matched. This $25,000 in seed money was the unofficial inception of the ACA. When a prime piece of property became available on the shores of Turnbull Bay, a tidal estuary west of New Smyrna Beach, Leeper raised the $50,000 necessary to buy the ten-acre plot. Three years later, five main buildings were completed. Over the years, five more buildings were constructed and an additional 59 acres were purchased as preserve land. The ACA officially opened in 1982 for the first residency with author James Dickey, sculptor Duane Hanson, and composer David Del Tredici. Since then, over 155 interdisciplinary residencies have taken place, featuring over 430 Master Artists and over 3,500 Associate Artists from around the world. Leeper was awarded honorary doctorates from Duke and from Stetson University. She was named Florida ambassador of the arts, and inducted into the Florida Hall of Fame in 1999.  A 45-year retrospective of her work was held at Cornell Fine Arts Museum in 1995. She died April 11, 2000 as the last resident of Eldora. After her death, the management of the town was officially turned over to the federal government, as the town is located more than two miles within the borders of the Canaveral National Seashore. The town claims no permanent residents and visitation is limited and subject to park hours. Only two of its original buildings remain. In 2020, Leeper's house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places."

Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Swartz trained in anthropology in the interdisciplinary Department of Social Relations at Harvard, receiving his PhD in 1958. He was a founding member of the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, San Diego, where he served as a member of the faculty for 36 years. During his career, Swartz was a founding member of the Society for Cultural Anthropology, former chairman of the American Society for Political Anthropology, a life member of the American Anthropological Association, a fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute and a member of the National Geographic Research board of editors. Swartz conducted extensive field research among indigenous peoples in highland Tanzania (the Bena), in Kenya (coastal Swahili, and on Chuuk atoll (formerly known as Truk) in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. In each case he was accompanied and assisted by his wife of 58 years, Audrey. Swartz dedicated his career to the study of the influence of culture over various aspects of human interaction, including the sources and maintenance of political power, social status, aggression, sexuality and medical beliefs. \u201cHe believed that human cultures were defined by common understandings that were shared, transmitted, prescriptive and morally forceful. He disputed the casual use of the word \u2018culture\u2019 to refer to artifacts or behaviors. To him, culture was what's in your head,\u201d said David K. Jordan, UC San Diego professor emeritus of anthropology and a longtime friend and colleague to Swartz.

        "content": "1987 Colour: Some Philosophical Problems from Wittgenstein. 1991 Colour: a Philosophical Introduction, (Oxford: Blackwell, 1991, 2nd ed) . In this work as in its 1987 predecessor Westphal subjects some of the statements in Wittgenstein's Remarks on Colour (\"the puzzle propositions\") to a detailed examination drawing on philosophy, phenomenology, psychology and physics. Rejecting Wittgenstein's grammatical explanation of colours, as well as the physicalists' reduction of colours to light emissions of specific wavelengths, Westphal argues that the puzzle propositions are analytic and that the relevant definitions are to be given in terms of phenomenalistically interpreted absorption spectra. According to WorldCat, the book is in 224 libraries 1998 Philosophical Propositions: An Introduction to Philosophy (London: Routledge, 1998). 169 pp. . According to WorldCat, the book is held in 1206 libraries In this work Westphal presents an introduction to key philosophical problems in chapters titled: The Nature of a Philosophical Problem; Basic Concepts of Logic and Philosophy; the Problem of Evil; the Existence of God; Reality; Certainty; Time; Personal Identity; the Mind-Body Problem; Freewill and Determinism; the Meaning of Life? 2005 \"Conflicting Appearances, Necessity and the Irreducibility of Propositions About Colours\", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society 105 (2):219-235. Reviewing the argument from 'conflicting appearances' for the view that nothing has any one colour, Westphal takes further a well-known criticism of the argument made by Austin and Burnyeat. He aIso undertakes the task of positive construction, offering a theory of what it is that all things coloured a particular colour have in common, and he argues that the resulting  \"color phenomenalism\", rather than physicalism, is required to give a satisfactory account of the necessity of Wittgenstein's 'puzzle propositions' about colour. (15 pages). Propositional variables p, q, etc., are the unit vectors in a vector space, and various logical relations are represented, e.g. duality is the sliding of a vector through the origin, which produces De Morgan's Theorems. 2006 \"The Future and the Truth-Value Links: A Common Sense View\",  Analysis 66 (289):1\u20139. This article is about the ancient problem of the truth of propositions about the future, or future contingents. Westphal argues that propositions about the future are true not because anything is now the case but because something will be the case. The problem is a confusion about tenses. 2008  \"\"My Body\", \"my X\" and \"I\"\" American Philosophical Quarterly, 45 (3):187-197. Sometimes 'My body is F follows from 'I am F, for example when F is \"hot\", but sometimes not, for example when F is \"rich\". Westphal offers a theory of the logical relations between \"mind\", \"body\", and \"I\" which gives a complete symmetry between mind and body. 2011 \"Silhouettes Are Shadows\",  Acta Analytica 26 2:187-197. Here a solution is proposed to Sorensen\u2019s problem about the eclipse of Near and Far. Since a silhouette is a shadow, what is seen is the silhouette or shadow of Far, into which Near has disappeared, as a smaller object might. Shadows are seen because the surface in shadow fails to reflect light. The Mind-Body Problem, (Cambridge MA: MIT Press, 2016) argues for a neutral monist solution to the mind-body problem, and claims that in the past neutral monists have paid almost no attention to the causal relations between mind and body."

She was raised in Scarborough, Ontario, having moved there in the mid-1970s. As a child, she became interested in black-and-white films from the Golden Age of Hollywood. She later wrote that the 1960 film The World of Suzie Wong spoke to her racial identity as an Asian Canadian, an experience she found to have influenced her filmmaking; excerpts from the film were included in her first short. Lee began her tertiary studies at the University of Western Ontario, taking art studio and business courses, before transferring to the University of Toronto; there she majored in English literature and film studies. By 1989 she was attending New York University (NYU), studying under Homi K. Bhabha, Faye Ginsburg, and Michael Taussig, with a scholarship. During this period she was influenced by Trinh T. Minh-ha's paradigms on women and ethnicity, as expressed in the 1989 book Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism; these were later expressed in Lee's first film. She later described Minh-ha as at one point being her \"ultimate role model\"."

For the film she used a second-hand Bolex camera and edited it with a Steenbeck editing suite. She later recalled that she recorded the film while in her pyjamas. The production cost a total of $4,000. Fellow Canadian filmmaker David Weaver described it as sexualizing Sally's body, something that Lee had not intended. The film was first screened at the Festival of Festivals in Toronto. After graduation, Lee attended the prestigious International Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art before returning to Canada. In 1992 Lee made the forty-minute long film My Niagara, which featured scenes shot in Japan that were reminiscent of home movies; the effect was obtained by filming in Super 8 Kodachrome, then transferring it to 16 mm film. Filmed in Etobicoke, Ontario, at the childhood home of co-writer Kerri Sakamoto, the film detailed a young Asian-Canadian woman living alone with her father after the death of her mother. Scenes were also shot at the R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant in Toronto. Francesca Duran in LIFT writes that the film, which had a budget of $80,000, had a theme of cultural displacement, and that My Niagara was well received. That year she also released the three-minute To Sir With Love. After My Niagara, Lee took a position as a director observer on the set of Atom Egoyan's Exotica, and then enrol at a summer program at the Canadian Film Centre (CFC). Meanwhile, she worked as a film and music critic for Now and extensively wrote about films for other publications. She took further studies at the Banff Centre for the Arts in Banff, Alberta, before returning to the CFC as a director residency. She continued to be involved with the American company Women Make Movies, a distributor of feminist media, which she had become involved with while at NYU. In 1995 Lee released the 26-minute-long Prey, starring Adam Beach and Sandra Oh; she described the film as a \"cross-cultural comedy\". The film, which followed a young Korean woman who falls in love with a drifter, was a collaboration with Cameron Bailey and dealt with themes of racial differences, immigration, and social class. The Canadian film critic and experimental filmmaker Mike Hoolboom compared the themes to those of the 1989 Hollywood film Do the Right Thing, writing that had short films been respected it would have been a watershed mark. That year she also released the four-minute M. Nourbese Philip. She then took a five-year hiatus, which she spent in Korea."

Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled Priceless, the film was shot in several formats with a fifteen-person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed in a medium shot, which Lee intended as a sign and not simply a sex scene. Although Priceless, meant as a sequel to Subrosa, went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv. Anita Lee, co-producer of Priceless, then suggested that Helen Lee make The Art of Woo, a romantic comedy sponsored by the Canadian Film Centre's Feature Film Project; it was Lee's feature film debut. Starring Adam Beach and Sook Yin Lee as Alessa Woo, the Toronto-set film follows an Asian-Canadian art dealer who finds herself living in close quarters with a handsome and talented Indigenous artist but considers him unworthy as he is penniless. The film also stars Don McKellar, Alberta Watson, Joel Keller, John Gilbert and Siu Ta. Executive producer was Peter O'Brian. Original paintings were provided by Kent Monkman to stand in for artworks by Beach's character, Ben Crowchild. Artworks were also loaned by Suzy Lake and then-Power Plant director, Marc Mayer, appears in a cameo. The film had its world premiere at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival, and was commercially released in Canada in 2001 by \"Cineplex Odeon Films. It was invited to the Busan International Film Festival that autumn, continuing its festival run. The original soundtrack\u00a0\u2013 by Ron Sexsmith and Kurt Swinghammer\u00a0\u2013 notably won a Genie Award for Best Achievement in Music\u00a0\u2013 Original Song. That year she also released the three-minute Star. After The Art of Woo, Lee announced that she intended to adapt Kerri Sakamoto's novel The Electrical Field with the author, and a \"romantic thriller\". However, neither has yet been released. In 2002 she mounted the video installation Cleaving at the Werkleitz Biennale in Germany. She married around 2008, and that same year released the short Hers at Last, about the interactions of two women living as \"outsiders\" in Korea. The short was premiered at the Seoul International Women's Film Festival as part of an omnibus entitled Ten Ten, in celebration of the festival's tenth anniversary. The omnibus also featured works by fellow directors Byun Young-joo, Ulrike Ottinger and Lee Su-yeon."

        "content": "Race, gender issues, sexual and racial identity often feature in Lee's works. The main characters, up through The Art of Woo, are Asian women that are \"caught up in some cross cultural encounter\". She writes that she attempts to address these issues through her films in non-didactic ways, such that the \"racial melancholia\u00a0... are like seepages in the more obvious dramatic or comedic content\". She contrasts her films with the 1993 drama The Joy Luck Club, which she considers a film with obvious, easily consumable, ethnic content. She considers the stereotype of Asian women as seductresses, either demure \"lotus blossoms\" or vociferous \"dragon ladies\", to be a degenerative one which is \"sometimes extremely offensive\", but one that has \"a cultural memory that demands [the viewer's] attention.\" Lee's works often include elements of sexuality in their characterizations. She writes that the main characters of My Niagara and Subrosa reach a greater understanding of themselves and their relationships after sexual encounters. She considers sex as \"never the culmination or end point\", but a signifier for intimacy. As such, she feels that the more intimate aspects of sex are best conveyed wordlessly, through how it is presented, although she concedes that \"talky sex\" can be appropriate for romantc comedies."

A native of Craven County, North Carolina, he moved to Greenville in the 1940s, and obtained his undergraduate degree from East Carolina University (ECU).  He received his dental degree from the Medical College of Virginia School of Dentistry in 1950.  Aldridge practiced as a dentist in Greenville, North Carolina for 50 years. Aldridge served on the Greenville City Council for a number of terms, and was elected to the North Carolina House (Ninth District) in 1994, defeating Democratic incumbent Charles McLawhorn.  He achieved notoriety in 1995 when he asserted that rape victims could not get pregnant.  In the context of a debate regarding whether the state should stop funding abortions for poor women, he stated, \"The facts show that people who are raped, who are truly raped, the juices don't flow, the body functions don't work, and they don't get pregnant.\"  He later stated that his comments were \"stupid.\"   Aldridge's 1995 comments were revisited in August 2012, in light of controversy surrounding U.S. Senate Candidate Todd Akin's similar comments. He was re-elected to his seat in 1996.  In 1998, Aldridge also received some press attention when, noting a report that non-white infant mortality rates were nearly twice as high as for white infants, commented that he doubted the report \"because it seems that most of the black people I know are bigger and tougher and stronger than whites.\"  Aldridge said afterwards that his comments were intended to be complimentary, as \"Black men are generally bigger, strong, better athletes.  I would suggest that you take a look at the professional baseball, basketball, and football teams.\" Aldridge retired from office in 1998, after losing to Democratic candidate Marian N. McLawhorn in the 1998 election.  He died at age 78 on February 2, 2002. Aldridge was also very active in community organizations, serving as president of the Pitt-Greenville Chamber of Commerce, Greenville Lion's Club, Greenville Boy's Club, and Greenville Little League.  He also served as president of the ECU Alumni Association."

In 1897 the sitting member of parliament for Deptford, Charles Darling, was appointed a judge of the Queen's Bench Division. This required him to vacate his seat, and Morton was chosen by the Conservative Party to contest the ensuing by-election.  Morton was elected and held the seat until 1906. In 1904 he was appointed an ecclesiastical commissioner. In 1903 Morton married Evelyn Wilson-Todd, daughter of Sir William Wilson-Todd of Halnaby Hall, and Tranby Park, Yorkshire, MP for Howdenshire. He divided his time between residences in Scotland (at North Berwick until his marriage and at Balabraes House, Ayton, Berwickshire thereafter), and Eaton Place in London.

From 1908, he lived in Heidenheim, where he graduated from high school in 1925 and subsequently worked as an apprentice. From 1927\u20141930, L\u00f6sch studied at the University of T\u00fcbingen and at the University of Freiburg. Then from 1930\u20141931, he studied at the University of Bonn, where he was taught by Joseph Schumpeter, Walter Eucken, and Arthur Spiethoff. He earned a degree in economics from the University of Freiburg in 1931, and then a doctorate one year later from the University of Bonn. L\u00f6sch studied demography and examined natural population growth in relation to its impact on labor supply and regional economic growth. This work then inspired L\u00f6sch to study the theory of production location. L\u00f6sch's work gained traction and global attention, earning him a Rockefeller scholarship. He visited the United States twice, in 1934 and 1936, where he studied the theories of the location of production and collected materials for his own research. L\u00f6sch then went on to work at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy as a senior researcher between 1939\u20141945. While at the institute in 1940, L\u00f6sch published \u201cSpatial Organization of the Economy\u201d which received interest from the scientific community.

        "content": "L\u00f6sch has been described as a creative yet stubborn by those who knew him. Although L\u00f6sch was born in \u00d6hringen, he spent the majority of his childhood and later life in Heidenheim an der Brenz, which is something he is very proud of, mentioning that Heidenheim is the one place he feels at \"home\". During his time abroad in the United States, he received several offers to reside in the US during World War Two, however, declined these offers, saying \"What will be the fate of Germany, if all of us leave the country?\". This refusal demonstrates his loyalty towards Germany and general stubbornness towards what he felt was right. After L\u00f6sch finished University, he moved to Kiel, Germany to work as a part-time professor and researcher at Institut f\u00fcr Weltwirtschaft while his wife and family remained in Heidenheim. In regard to his political and religious stance, L\u00f6sch was a part of the \"Confessing Church\" known as \"Bekennende Kirche\", which was a Protestant group against Nazi Germany under the ruling of Adolf Hitler. Being a Protestant who was openly in opposition towards Nazi Germany and Hitler put L\u00f6sch in a situation where he had to choose between his moral integrity during a grave period of political oppression with the amplifying demand for independent and critical thinking regarding relevant societal, political, and spatial issues. When World War Two began, he resisted to emigrate, leaving him with the only choice: to go into hiding in Ratzeburg, to continue his research anti-nazi work. When the war ended, Germany was left destroyed, which made it impossible for him to return home to his wife and family in Heidenheim. Since he was unable to return home, he remained in the poor living conditions in Ratzeburg where he continued his economic research. Unfortunately, the end of his life was devastating; due to his impoverished state and weak health, he caught the scarlet fever infection and passed away shortly after without any of his loved ones or friends by his side. His personal life indeed shows his undying motivation, creativity, passion and loyalty towards his promise to further scientific discoveries and fundamental theory. Regrettably, L\u00f6sch was never granted the recognition he deserved for his research because of his resistance against Nazi Germany, however, his work has helped with preceding economic research."

        "content": "August L\u00f6sch is recognized as an early innovator in the subject of the New Economic Geography, known for his great contributions to regional and urban economics, as well as his influence to expand regional economics. L\u00f6sch's early research was primarily focused on international trade and population economics, which guided him to his important contributions in regional development and on the location theory, rewriting these economic concepts from a spatial perspective. L\u00f6sch's scientific writings focused on issues of the economic consequences of population decline, the impact of population dynamics on business cycles and capital markets and economics of aging. At the start of the 1930s, L\u00f6sch began his research in economic trade, more specifically, comparative advantage, tariff barriers in trade, the relationship between demography and trade, the role of different taxation systems and monetary policy, as well as cross-border shipping. Soon after, he began his research in location theory and regional development and had his first publication discussing location theory in 1939 in an article called 'The Nature of Economic Regions'. L\u00f6sch's his research and findings on economic spatial interactions and structure were very significant, as he was the initial person to illustrate a full general equilibrium system explaining the interrelationship of all locations which was shown in his theory of economic regions. Furthermore, L\u00f6sch is also known for the way in which he studied economic spatial interactions and structures, as he typically began with abstract theoretical paradigms on regions and spatial-economic behavior rather than evidence-based formations, as previous economists had used. Overall, L\u00f6sch made a plenitude of significant findings in the world of economics, but his main contributions were to regional economics, specifically, pioneering the location theory, spatial equilibrium analysis and hierarchical spatial systems displaying a hexagonal pattern."

        "content": "Xu and his students pioneered a method to use cadaver images to construct voxel human phantoms that are anatomically realistic. Xu et al. 2000 reported, for the first time, a method in adopting a set of high-fidelity color image dataset from the Visible Human Project to develop the VIP-Man phantom which remains today to be one of the \u201cfinest\u201d voxel phantoms with a voxel size of 0.33mm x 0.33mm x 1\u00a0mm. The phantom sets a world record in the total number of voxels in Monte Carlo simulations \u00be 4 billion voxels which required special treatment in the Monte Carlo code.  The methodology behind the development of VIP-Man phantom represented a breakthrough in using \u201cvoxels\u201d in Monte Carlo dose calculations for the human body.  This is the first time when the bone marrow and eye lenses were directly segmented and identified in the phantom for radiation dosimetry purposes. His group was the first to have developed a capability in using four different Monte Carlo codes (MCNP, MCNPX, EGS, GEANT4) for voxel phantom dose calculations involving photons, electrons, protons, and many other heavy ions. The VIP-Man phantom, which has been shared with several hundreds of researchers worldwide, made it possible to study radiation dosimetry in health physics as well as medical physics (medical imaging and radiotherapy). As of May 15, 2012, this paper has been cited 266 times and, according to Google Scholar, is the most cited paper in \u201ccomputational dosimetry phantoms\u201d. For this work, Dr. Xu was awarded the National Science Foundation's Faculty CAREER Award in 1999.  He is one of the few nuclear engineering faculty members who have received this highly selective award. Xu et al. 2007 reported a method for developing the 3rd-generation computational phantoms using the so-called \u201cboundary representation (BREP)\u201d geometry \u2013 NURBS and triangular meshes developed by the computer graphics community.  Dr. Xu and students demonstrated, for the first time, that it was possible to rapidly create phantoms representing a pregnant mother at the end of 3-, 6-, and 9-month gestational periods without relying on patient images that are difficult to obtain for pregnant patients.  This innovative method also afforded the ability to simulate changes in human posture as well as physiology-caused organ deformation such as respiration.  This paper was rated among 10 of the best and most popular articles by the journal of Physics in Medicine and Biology and was one of the finalists for the Roberts\u2019 Prize in 2007. Han et al. 2010 investigated a pair of phantoms that represent individuals walking on contaminated ground. Ding et al. 2012 examined the effect of obesity on the calculated radiation dose from CT. Xu and his students developed the first set of overweight and obese phantoms. This was the most downloaded PMB article in 2012. This study received more than 130 pieces of worldwide media coverage about this study (within 30 days after the publication). In 2005, Dr. Xu co-founded the Consortium of Computational Human Phantoms (CCHP) -- an international collaborative project that promotes research and standardization among researchers. As part of the CCHP's initiatives, Dr. Xu co-edited the \u201cHandbook of Anatomical Models for Radiation Dosimetry\u201d that provides, for the first time, a comprehensive summary of 50 years of research related to computational phantoms for radiation dosimetry. After two years of preparation involving 60 authors from 13 countries, the 30-chapter book was published in 2009.  Following the publication of this important book, Dr. Xu continued to play a leading role in the international community by organizing and chairing The Third International Workshop on Computational Phantoms for Radiation Protection, Imaging and Radiotherapy in Beijing, China on August 8 and 9, 2011."

        "content": "As early as 1943, commentators such as Neville Cardus were noticing that his piano playing, while showing great skill and promise, revealed the soul of someone other than a performer (Cardus suggested composing or conducting might be Watson's natural bents). Watson spent some years living in the United Kingdom as a touring performer. On 22 October 1951, to celebrate the 140th anniversary of the birth of Franz Liszt, he performed the complete Transcendental \u00c9tudes in a concert at the Wigmore Hall. On that occasion he also premiered Humphrey Searle's Piano Sonata, Op. 21, written for the occasion. (The sonata was loosely based on Liszt's Sonata in B minor and has been described as \"probably, both the finest and most original piano work ever produced by a British composer\".) Watson later recorded the sonata, but the recording was quickly deleted. In 1957 he was able to introduce Searle to his teacher Egon Petri. Watson wrote the sleeve notes for the LP recording of classic Egon Petri performances issued by EMI in 1967 as number 7 in its Great Instrumentalists series. In 1951 he was chosen by Constant Lambert to play the difficult piano part in the premiere of his final ballet, Tiresias. In late 1952 he gave the premiere performance of Darius Milhaud's 1st Piano Concerto, in London. In 1954/55, Watson commissioned a piano concerto from Humphrey Searle (his first), but was unable to be the soloist at the premiere at the Cheltenham Festival in July 1955 as he was touring in Australia. He did, however, premiere Searle's 2nd Piano Concerto, Op. 27, on 14 August 1956, at the Royal Albert Hall, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under John Hollingsworth. On 20 August 1956 Watson and Thea King gave the first performance of Humphrey Searle's Suite for Clarinet and Piano. In 1958 on a visit home to Sydney he was asked by Winifred Burston, a renowned piano teacher at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, to assess the young Larry Sitsky's skills. He did so, and he and Burston jointly formed the view that Sitsky would benefit from study with Egon Petri, who accepted him as a pupil. Sitsky went on to study with Petri for over three years, from May 1958 until the end of 1961.  In 1950 in London he also gave some months of lessons to another of Burston's pupils, Geofrey Parsons. Gordon Watson played the solo piano part of Brian Easdale's score for the controversial 1960 Michael Powell film Peeping Tom. In 1964 Sir Bernard Heinze appointed Watson to succeed Winifred Burston on the teaching staff of the Sydney Conservatorium. He was the head of the Keyboard Department until 1986, being succeeded by Elizabeth Powell (pianist)|Elizabeth Powell. His students included: Gerard Willems, Michael Kieran Harvey, Stephanie McCallum (she dedicated her album \"Perfume: The Exquisite Piano Music of France\" to her teacher Gordon Watson), Elena Kats-Chernin, Carey Beebe, Barry Walmsley, Brennan Keats, Garry Laycock (1944\u201388; who also used the professional name Leon Gibbons), Romano Crivici and Peter Carthew. He was a juror for the Sydney International Piano Competition in 1981 and 1985. The Australian pedagogue and composer Alex Burnard (1900\u20131971), a student of Ralph Vaughan Williams, wrote a set of Twelve Folk-Songs Settings for Watson. Gordon Watson died in Sydney on 16 April 1999. An obituary appeared in The Sydney Morning Herald on 27 April."

        "content": "Wayne Lamar Peace, Jr. (born November 3, 1961) is an American former college and professional football quarterback and current high school football coach in Lakeland, Florida. He was born in Lakeland, Florida, and attended Lakeland High School, where he was an all-state football and basketball player. He was recruited by several top college programs and chose to accept a scholarship to play for coach Charley Pell at the University of Florida. Peace became the Gators' starting quarterback just five games into his freshman season of 1980 when a knee injury to starter Bob Hewko propelled the rookie into the lineup, and he performed well enough to keep the starting job for most of the next three and a half seasons.  Over his career at Florida, Peace lead the Gators to a 28-12-1 record, four bowl games, and their first ever top-10 ranking in the final AP Poll (No. 6 in 1983). He set several individual records as well; his career completion percentage (61.6%) was a school record and his 7,206 passing yards were second in school history when he graduated.  During his junior season in 1982, Peace set an NCAA record for completion percentage (70.7%) which was broken by Steve Young the following year.  Peace appeared on the cover of the September 13, 1982 cover of Sports Illustrated. In one of a series of articles written for The Gainesville Sun in 2006, the Sun sportswriters ranked him as No. 81 all-time greatest Gator of the first 100 years of Florida football.  He was later inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great.\" In the spring of 1984, Peace signed with the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League (USFL), who were coached by former Florida quarterback Steve Spurrier.  Peace played in several games, sharing time under center with another Florida alumnus, John Reaves.  After the league folded, Peace was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the first round of the 1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL Players, the second USFL quarterback picked after Steve Young. However, he was waived during preseason camp in August 1985. Peace tried out for several other National Football League (NFL) teams over the next two seasons, signing briefly with the Miami Dolphins and playing in preseason games with the San Diego Chargers, but he did not make a regular season roster and decided to retire from football in late 1986.

Between 1911 and 1912, he studied at the University of Breslau, Germany, and worked in the mental and nervous clinics. In 1917, he became director of the New York Police's new Police Psychopathic Laboratory. However, with the start of World War I, Hamilton entered the U.S. Army. He spent two years as a psychiatrist with the 42nd Division and the Third Army. Upon his return from Europe, he became the Medical Director at the Philadelphia Hospital for Mental Disorder and served in this position from 1920 to 1922. Then, he took the position of Assistant Medical Director at the private hospital, Bloomingdale Insane Asylum which was affiliated with the Cornell Medical School and the New York Hospital. He remained at Bloomingdale from 1923 to 1936. During those years, he also served as director of Hospital Service for the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, a voluntary lay organization. This period began a career of surveys of public mental hospitals under the auspices of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene and later, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Neurological Association, the U.S. Public Health Service, and the Rockefeller Foundation. Hamilton's experience in state mental hospitals came to the fore in the 1930s. The public mental hospitals in the various states had become overcrowded, understaffed, and received inadequate funding. Public interest had been aroused by publications of hospitals conditions. In 1935, the American Medical Association (AMA) began an investigation at the instigation of its Mental Health committee. The AMA surveys were discontinued and only a statistical report of the findings was published, with no known further action. Later, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) took up the effort and joined the national and state mental health associations in the effort to improve conditions in the mental hospitals. In 1928, the State Society for Mental Health of Connecticut obtained funds to conduct a survey of mental hospitals, under the direction of Hamilton. The survey was published in 1936 with numerous recommendations.  The survey reports met wide acceptance as numerous states began obtaining funds for similar surveys, which often resulted in increased funding by state legislatures to improve conditions in the state mental hospitals. Following his U.S. Army service during World War II, Hamilton accepted the position as Superintendent of the Essex Overbrook Hospital in New Jersey. He stayed there until 1950. He returned to Burlington, Vermont to continue his consultant activities. In 1951, the Governor of Vermont requested Hamilton's expertise with the Women's State Reformatory in Rutland, Vermont."

Manley and colleagues identified and characterized the key factors responsible for polyadenylation of mRNA precursors, and elucidated how this remarkably complex machinery functions in gene regulation, for example during cell growth and differentiation. He has also studied the mechanism and regulation of the process by which introns are removed from mRNA precursors, mRNA splicing. Manley and his coworkers codiscovered the first alternative splicing factor (SR protein), characterized how this and other splicing regulatory proteins function and are themselves regulated, showed how alternative splicing can become deregulated in disease, and with respect to mechanism demonstrated that two spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs by themselves have catalytic activity. Finally, he elucidated unexpected links between these mRNA processing reactions and transcription, DNA damage signaling and maintenance of genomic stability.  His work has thus provided considerable insight into the complex mechanisms that are essential for the regulated production of mRNAs in mammalian cells."

Reynolds received his PhD in physics from Princeton in 1943, writing a thesis of the propagation of shock waves. During World War II, he joined the United States Navy, and served with the Manhattan Project. He worked with George Kistiakowsky on the design of the explosive lenses required by the implosion-type nuclear weapon. He was involved in the investigation of the Port Chicago disaster, served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was part of the Manhattan Project team sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to inspect the bomb damage. After the war, Reynolds began a long academic career at Princeton University. He was director of the Princeton's High Energy Physics Program from 1948 until 1970, when he became the first director of Princeton's new Center for Environmental Studies. He combined his interest in the sea and science by working during the summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where he studied marine bioluminescence. He also worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution."

        "content": "World War II was raging at this time, and someone with a doctorate in such a topic area was highly sought after by the wartime Manhattan Project, but Reynolds turned down an offer to join it. An avid surf fisherman and sailor, he aspired to join the United States Navy. He attempted to enlist, but was turned down because he wore glasses. He then lobbied the Navy, which waived this requirement. He was then commissioned as an ensign in 1943, and married Virginia Rendall, a librarian, while he waited for his first assignment. Instead of the seafaring assignment he hoped for, Reynolds was sent to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory to assist George Kistiakowsky in the design of the explosive lenses required by the implosion-type nuclear weapon. In April 1944, Kistiakowsky named Reynolds as one of eleven men that he would like to have working for him at Los Alamos. Reynolds was one of the naval officers who was sent to investigate the Port Chicago disaster, in which an ammunition ship had blown up in the harbor.  He was tasked with estimating the size of the explosion, based upon observations of the damage. His estimate was  \u00b1  tons. A bill of lading was subsequently found for 1,540 tons, confirming his estimate. Reynolds was one of several researchers who determined that an atomic bomb would do maximum damage if detonated in the air rather than at ground level. He later served with Project Alberta, the part of the Manhattan Project for operations in the field. He served on Tinian, where the worked with the X-Unit Section, which was responsible for the Fat Man bomb's firing unit. He flew a number of practice missions, but not the bombing of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. After the fighting ended, he was part of the Manhattan Project team sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to inspect the bomb damage."

        "content": "After the war, Reynolds accepted an offer of an assistant professorship at Princeton University. He would spend the rest of his career there, being promoted to associate professor in 1951, and then to professor in 1959. John Archibald Wheeler interested him in cosmic rays. Reybolds was director of the Princeton's High Energy Physics Program from 1948 to 1970.  He initially recruited Ronald Rau from Caltech and Joseph Ballam from  the University of California. Ballam eventually became a professor and division head at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, while Rau went on to become Chairman of the Physics Department at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Reynolds later hired Sam Treiman, Giorgio Salvini, Riccardo Giacconi, Val Fitch and Jim Cronin. His reputation for spotting and hiring talent was assured when Giacconi, Fitch and Cronin won Nobel Prizes. For his cosmic ray research, Reynolds attempted to grow large organic crystal scintillators to use as ionized particle detectors. Scintillators are luminescent materials that, when struck by an incoming particle, absorb its energy and scintillate \u2013 emit light. They are used in many areas of scientific research. He was frustrated by cracks in the crystals, and attempted to get around the problem by dissolving them in liquid. To the surprise of many, the liquid was just as effective as crystal scintillators. Today, liquid scintillators are in widespread use in nuclear, biological and medical research. He also developed automated X-ray detectors for  collecting data on protein structures. Interest in environmental issues increased in the late 1960s, and in 1970, Princeton established Princeton's Center for Environmental Studies. Reynolds was appointed as its first director. Under his leadership, it investigated a number of unusual inter-disciplinary topics, such as energy conservation in buildings, indoor air quality, the relationship between nuclear power and nuclear weapons, and the decision-making process in environmental issues Although most of his career was at Princeton, he spent some time in England, where was a Churchill Fellow at Cambridge University in 1973 and 1974. He was later a visiting Senior Research Fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Oxford University, and a visiting professor at Oxford Research Unit of the Open University, from 1981 to 1982, and a Royal Society Guest Research Fellow at Oxford University in 1985. Reynolds became the Class of 1909 Professor of Physics in 1978, and Professor Emeritus 1987. For 31 years he combined his interest in the sea and science by working during the summer at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where he studied marine bioluminescence. He also worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Reynolds died from cancer at his home in the Skillman section of Montgomery Township, New Jersey on April 19, 2005. He was survived by his wife, Virginia, and his four sons, G. Thomas, Richard, Robert and David."

In the legitimate development of that noble work, which ended in the suppression of slavery, as well as of the slave trade, throughout the British dominions. He was critical of Wilberforce (and the old guard of the movement in general) as being indecisive and too ready to compromise.  Wilberforce, he said, was excessively deferential to \"rank and power\".  Sir George Stephen bore a leading part, and it was his decision (extorted from him by the necessities of the case) in favour of admitting the principle of compensation (Compensated emancipation, paying the slave owners for the loss of their \"property\") that brought the agitation to a much earlier successful issue than could otherwise have been ensured."

He also wrote on political and ethical dilemmas of the South African society, and since the 1960s he was an outspoken critic of the apartheid ideology. After clashes with the authorities of the Dutch Reformed Church, he had to leave the Philosophy department and was appointed head of the Department of Political Philosophy.

Engstrom served one term apiece in the Alaska House of Representatives and the Alaska Senate as a Republican during the 1960s, leaving in 1971. He was also a part of one of Alaska's longest-enduring political families; his father served in Alaska's territorial and state senates, his mother served in the territorial house, and his daughter, Cathy Mu\u00f1oz was a member of the Alaska House from 2011 through January 16, 2017. Elton Egedeous Engstrom Jr. was born in Juneau, Alaska, the elder of two sons born to Thelma Catherine (n\u00e9e Wait) and Elton Engstrom, Sr.  His father moved to Juneau from Wrangell in 1928.  The Engstrom family were involved in the fisheries business and in local politics in Wrangell, and the elder Engstrom would continue in both endeavors in Juneau. Engstrom served in the United States Army. He graduated from the University of Oregon and received his law degree from Harvard Law School.  He worked in the family business, the Engstrom Brothers fish brokerage, and assumed management of the firm following his father's death in 1963.  He was also in business in property management and retail arts sales.  He was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 1964, serving a single term.

        "content": "George Viner Ellis FRS (25 September 1812 Minsterworth - 25 April 1900 Minsterworth) was Professor of Anatomy at University College London and one of the foremost anatomists of his time. George Viner was the second son of Viner Ellis of Duni House, Minsterworth, near Gloucester, his family having been landowners in the area for many years. His education was at the Crypt Grammar School from where he went to the Cathedral Grammar School, and later was apprenticed to a Dr Buchanan of Gloucester. His uncle, Daniel Ellis, a member of the Royal Society Edinburgh, suggested that he enrol as a medical student at the newly founded University College London. In his vacations he studied in Paris and attended lectures and worked at anatomy in Berlin. Ellis was Demonstrator of Anatomy under Professor Richard Quain, and succeeded him in the Chair of Anatomy in 1850, retiring as Emeritus Professor in 1877, but always aloof from the professional world. He was succeeded by Sir George Dancer Thane (1850-1930). Ellis was one of the great names of the world of anatomy in England, having given all his working life to the study and teaching of this discipline, and was held in the highest respect. His lectures were conscientiously precise and lucid, so that his students always paid close attention. In 1840 he published \"Demonstrations of Anatomy: being a Guide to the Knowledge of the Human Body by Dissections\", his name becoming a household word among medical students, and his work becoming the standard textbook in England and the United States. The 11th edition of his book was published in 1890. University College London in its first thirty-five years of existence, published an extraordinary number of anatomical atlases. Ellis carried on this tradition by collaborating with the South African natural history illustrator, George Henry Ford, to produce some of the best anatomical artwork ever published. They used the relatively new technique of chromolithography for their imperial folio atlas of fifty-eight plates, \"Illustrations of Dissections in a Series of Original Coloured Plates the Size of Life\". The plates were done between 1863 and 1867, with from four to seven completed each year. These plates are considered exceptionally clear and accurate, with an aesthetic depiction of the cadavers, printed by Mintern Bros., and published by James Walton. During Ellis' tenure the University College London was regarded as the pre-eminent centre for the study of anatomy, its spacious and well-lit dissecting room approved of by both staff and students. The College was fortunate in acquiring and retaining the services of an anatomist of Ellis' stature - his culture, zeal, and energy were legendary - receiving only a moderate salary and with no prospect of career improvement. In Ellis' day cadavers were not treated with any preservatives, so that they were often in an advanced state of putrefaction, limiting dissection to the winter months. Several times he acted as Examiner in Anatomy at the University of London, but declined to join the Court of Examiners of the Royal College of Surgeons. On his retirement Ellis came into a small fortune left him by a relative, built himself a house at Minsterworth, 'Severn Bank', and lived there quietly with his younger sister, devoting himself to gardening and apple-growing. He also ran night classes for the older boys of the parish. A few years before his death he became blind and was tended by his sister. \"Ellis' muscle\", the Corrugator cutis ani muscle, is named after him."

In her classic work, Women workers and the industrial revolution, 1750\u20131850, based on her Ph.D. thesis, Pinchbeck argued that in the long run, the Industrial Revolution increased women's employment opportunities, was beneficial to women's social and economic position and therefore was a liberating factor. This conclusion was in contrast to the earlier view of Alice Clark, who believed that industrial capitalism was responsible for the exclusion of women from paid employment, and thus played a crucial role in modern women's oppression. Pinchbeck's two-volume Children in English Society, co-authored with the help of Margaret Hewitt, a former student, described the conditions of poor and orphaned children, from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries, and discussed how legislative and voluntary responses to them had changed over the period."

In his 30-year career in Shell, Van Beurden has worked in a number of countries, from his native Netherlands, to Malaysia, United Kingdom and the United States. Before becoming CEO of Shell, Van Beurden was the Director of Shell's Downstream business from January to September 2013. Prior to this, he was the Executive Vice President Chemicals from December 2006 based out of London, when he served on the boards of a number of leading industry associations, including the International Council of Chemical Associations and the European Chemical Industry Council. He has held a number of key roles in the group's Upstream and Downstream businesses, including  the post of Vice President Manufacturing Excellence from January 2005. Van Beurden was an assistant to Shell chairman Phil Watts from 2002-2004, during which time Shell was embroiled in an accounting scandal where it had overstated its oil reserves. Lauded for his \u201cdeep knowledge of the industry and proven executive experience across a range of Shell businesses\u201d, Van Beurden is credited with turning around Shell's struggling chemicals division. From a loss-making enterprise in 2008, the Chemicals business now contributes 5 percent of net earnings. He also worked for a third of his 30-year Shell career in its liquefied natural gas business, which has become a crucial driver of the group's growth. In 2014, he was paid \u20ac24.2 million. In 2018, Van Beurden's compensation was approximately \u00a317.2 million. During his tenure as head of Shell, the company was ordered by a Netherlands court to reduce its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030. Van Beurden described the ruling as \"unreasonable\" and said the company had no intentions to meet the court-ordered climate targets. At the same time, Shell's profits were rising sharply, the company raised its dividend by almost 40%, and kickstarted share buybacks worth $2 billion. He is a member of the European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT), and a board member of International Council of Chemicals Associations and the European Chemical Industry Council."

Daly was the seventh child of General Sir Henry Dermot Daly and Susan Kirkpatrick.  Like his brother, Arthur Daly, he was educated at Winchester College. He then studied at Balliol College, Oxford before being commissioned into the Gloucestershire Regiment in 1881. Daly was transferred to the British Indian Army in 1883 and saw action in the Third Anglo-Burmese War, during which he was Mentioned in Dispatches. Daly was Superintendent of North Shan States between 1888 and 1891. He was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1892. Daly went on the become the Assistant Secretary, Foreign Department between 1892 and 1896 and the Deputy Secretary, Foreign Department between 1896 and 1903. He was promoted to major in 1901. He gained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the service of the Indian Army. He was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in 1903 and was Agent to the Governor-General in Central India between 1905 and 1910. He was Resident of Mysore and Chief Commissioner of Coorg between 1910 and 1916. Daly was invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (K.C.I.E.) in 1911 and as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India in 1916. Sir Hugh Daly, served as the Resident of Mysore State and Chief Commissioner of Coorg (1910-). He played a vital role in signing the 1913 Treaty of Mysore, which made the Mysore Government equal to the British India Government. He was also involved in negotiating with the Madras Presidency with regards to sharing the Cauvery River water, on behalf of the Mysore State. He served as the first honorary president of the Daly Memorial Hall. The Daly Memorial Hall in Bangalore is named after him. Daly married Diana Maria Denison on 16 July 1891. Together they had one daughter. Daly retired to the Isle of Wight, where he died in 1939."

        "content": "Treviranus graduated from University of Toronto in 1981 with a B.Sc. in Occupational Therapy.  In 1994, she earned a M.A. in Special Education from University of Toronto; she continues to pursue post graduate work at University College Dublin, Ireland. At the beginning of her career, for the first personal computers\u00a0\u2013 the Apple II Plus, the Tandy Model 100, the Texas Instruments computers, and later the Commodore 64 and Vic 20\u00a0\u2013 Treviranus designed alternative access systems for people with disabilities.    She was assisted by experts at the University of Washington, the National Research Council Rehabilitation Technology Unit and the Microcomputer Application Program at the Hugh MacMillan Centre. This project began while Treviranus was under contract as a tutor at McMaster in the Faculty of Health Sciences to integrate 12 students with disabilities into McMaster University in compliance with Bill 82, the Ontario Education Act by the Education Amendment Act, 1980, which states that \"the responsibility of school boards to provide (or to agree with another board to provide) in accordance with the regulations, special education programs and special education services for their exceptional pupils.\" The McMaster experience \"was a pivotal moment for Treviranus and inspired her work with people with disabilities (PWDs) and in the field of Inclusive Design.\" In 1994, Treviranus founded the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC) at the University of Toronto. Her first major research project was in collaboration with SoftQuad and Yuri Rubinsky, funded by Canarie. The goal of the project was to embed accessibility support, in the form of an on-screen \"visual dynamic keyboard\" that offered various text-entry methods, into HoTMeTaL, an early HTML editor. This in part, with Mike Paciello's help, led to the formation of the Web Accessibility Initiative of the W3C. Treviranus moved the ATRC to OCAD University in 2010 and rebranded it as the IDRC.  \"She has played a leading role in developing accessibility legislation, standards and specifications internationally (including WAI ATAG, IMS AccessForAll, ISO 24751, and AODA Information and Communication)\". In 2000, Treviranus was a chief expert witness in Maguire v SOCOG 2000 an Australian human rights case regarding the inaccessibility of the Sydney Olympics.  Bruce Maguire won the case leading to changes in accessibility requirements at international games.  Further, as a result of this case, the Australian government made the decision to require its agencies to employ W3C Guidelines. In 2007, Treviranus was an expert witness in the Donna Jodhan Canadian Supreme Court case whose verdict compelled the Canadian Government to make all of their websites accessible. As the founder of the IDRC and the IDI, one of the areas that Treviranus focuses her efforts on is making the internet accessible through research on assistive tools such as screen readers, touch pads and joysticks.  Treviranus\u2019s research has been used by the Government of Ontario Diversity Office as well as by the United Nations to create disability policy such as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Her work is the focal point of a feasibility study by the United States Department of Education on accessibility. As a university professor, she established a new Master of Design in Inclusive Design (MDes INCD) programme at OCAD University in 2010.  The MDes INCD programme teaches the fundamentals of Inclusive Design.  \"Part of the reason I came to OCADU was because there was the opportunity to start a new graduate program.\" What is unique about the MDes INCD programme is that the students in the programme are selected for their diversity\u00a0\u2013 from a very wide range of interests and expertise. In 2012 Treviranus cofounded the annual Designing Enabling Economies and Policies (DEEP) Conference to \"engage in substantive in-depth discussion about implementation strategies for digital inclusion of persons with disabilities among decision makers promoting the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in their respective countries; To identify levers and innovative approaches that go beyond current strategies.\" Treviranus is the lead project editor of the ISO 24751 standard, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 36, which supports automatic matching of user accessibility needs with digital resources and user interface configurations. Jutta Treviranus chairs the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AUWG) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative."

Because information devices and delivery systems are so easy to change, and are flexible, that allows for infinite permutations so that obstacles faced by disabled students can be overcome.  Further, Treviranus asserts that when educational resources are shared that further enhances an education system's ability to provide a match for each student's needs. An embodiment of these ideals is the open educational resources (OER) community since it has the potential to rectify several of the flaws of traditional education. One way to stop OERs from experiencing the same problems as traditional education is to embrace imperfection.  She notes that another risk to inclusive education is the overuse of the big data statistical analysis which can be used to justify non-inclusion."

One with a 15-in. LCD screen for a face goes to school in the absent child's place. The other remains in the hospital, transmitting an image of the child's face to the classroom. Using a video-game-style controller, the child can direct the school robot to raise its hand to ask a question or swivel its head to follow the teacher.\" Treviranus et alia noted that, \"The results indicate that, overall, PEBBLES has a very positive effect on both the young and adult participants; the most dramatic effect of all was on the ill child who used PEBBLES to attend school.\" Treviranus has been involved with computer technology, robotics  and learning from the very beginning."

Another observation that Treviranus makes is that by breaking down digital barriers and therefore making education more inclusive has advantages for all learners, including non-PWDs, such as causing the learning environment to become much more open, fluid and accepting of individual talents and interests. Taking further the abstract notion of serving individual learners, Treviranus discusses an accessibility strategy called Access For All that hones in on the need for accessible automated systems to collect resources and spread this network globally."

To arrive at, perhaps, a potential solution/direction of a solution, to the problem, Treviranus conducted research that examined the understanding of spatial ideas like geography by using a number of non-visual techniques: haptics (haptic technology, haptic communication, haptic perception, haptic poetry, and haptic media), 3D real world sounds and talking to figure out the best ways to communicate various kinds of data."

        "content": "In the context of an ever increasingly digital economy, and the requirement/tendency to combine technology of all sorts into everyday life, there is a potential problem for even larger numbers of people to become marginalized since accessible technology only meets the needs of a few, be it at a very high cost, and this accessible technology is frequently not compatible with newer technology\u00a0\u2013 and, so destined to fail.  A public policy response to this is the creation of a Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) that will access, by way of the cloud, a pool of resources that will marry supply and demand so that accessible technology will be automatically provided to every individual that needs it so that they will not have to justify, or bargain. GPII is a global collaboration with end-users and programmers/developers and industry players that has designed a platform, premised on the one-size-fits-one philosophy, with three major parts: firstly, a system to users to determine the best interface for them, located in the cloud; secondly, a way to cause all digital interfaces they come across to adapt to their needs instead of vice versa; and, thirdly, provide the data and digital design and programming techniques for both mainstream and assistive technology developers more economically efficiently. Treviranus has observed that human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers working on projects such as GPII are more than ever impacted by public policy considerations from not only government bodies but also from both the corporate world and NGOs, for example organizations that set standards such as the ISO group. Another public policy notion that Treviranus describes is the curb-cut phenomenon that envisions how the new technology and other modes of accommodating PWDs will be scaled up and used to economically benefit the broader majority\u00a0\u2013 not only PWDs."

        "content": "As early as 1992, Treviranus had begun working in the field of Inclusive Design.  In, 'An Overview of Human-computer Interaction Techniques for People with Physical Disabilities,' Treviranus and her team stressed that being able to have physical contact with computers is of essential importance for people with disabilities; they researched a large array of cutting edge technological solutions that allowed users with a variety of physical impairments to use and interact with computer technology. The paper anticipates changing input devices like keyboards and mice to technology involving switches to allow for the physical difficulties of users. Developing from the notion that the disabled require interaction with technology, Treviranus goes on to postulate that the alternative technological techniques that are being developed to be used with computers be as easy to use as the control mechanisms they replace such as speech or touch-typing for example. This idea is further developed with suggestion that computer interfaces fit each individual user no matter where they encounter the interface\u00a0\u2013 from public workstation to online learning environments. For the Web Accessibility Initiative, in 1999,  Treviranus co-edited Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines. This text helped web developers to, firstly, design authoring tools that create web content that is accessible and, as well, secondly, to help them to design accessible authoring tool user interfaces.  By 2008, Treviranus was able to outline how important authoring tools are to the process of creating accessible websites. By using tools that adhere to the standards established by the W3C Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG), developers of websites who are not familiar with accessibility concerns, or who are not enthusiastic about helping people with disabilities,  end up producing accessible sites because the tools they are using are pre-set to create accessible content by default. To further understand the need for accessible technology, for example, Treviranus describes the adaptation and substitution of ordinary input mechanisms like keyboards and mice with switches that allow the physically disabled to have access to digital technology."

        "content": "Prior to coming out, McBride was a campaign staffer in Delaware, working on several campaigns including Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden's 2010 campaign and Governor Jack Markell's 2008 campaign. In 2011, McBride was elected student body president at American University. During her last week as student body president, McBride gained international attention when she came out as a transgender woman in her college's student newspaper, The Eagle. McBride's coming out was featured on NPR, The Huffington Post, and by Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation. After coming out, McBride received a call from Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, saying, \"Sarah, I just wanted you to know, I'm so proud of you. I love you, and you're still a part of the Biden family.\"  Vice President Joe Biden expressed similar sentiments, sharing that he was proud of her and happy for her. In 2012, McBride interned at the White House, becoming the first openly transgender woman to work there in any capacity. McBride worked in the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs, where she worked on LGBT issues. In a speech in May 2015, Second Lady Jill Biden told Sarah's story. She added, \"we believe young people should be valued for who they are, no matter what they look like, where they're from, the gender with which they identify, or who they love.\" In January 2013, McBride joined the board of directors of Equality Delaware and quickly became the state's leading advocate for legal protections and hate crimes legislation for transgender Delawareans. McBride and her family led the lobbying effort for legislation protecting Delawareans from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression in employment, housing, insurance, and public accommodations. In addition to serving as the primary spokesperson for the legislation, McBride's close relationship with Governor Jack Markell and Attorney General Beau Biden was credited with getting both elected officials vocally behind the bill. The legislation passed the state senate by a margin of one vote and the state house by a vote of 24\u201317. The amended bill was then re-passed by the state senate and immediately signed into law by Markell in June 2013. Upon signing the legislation, Markell stated:I especially want to thank my friend Sarah McBride, an intelligent and talented Delawarean who happens to be transgender. She courageously stood before the General Assembly to describe her personal struggles with gender identity and communicate her desire to return home after her college graduation without fear. Her tireless advocacy for passage of this legislation has made a real difference for all transgender people in Delaware.After the passage of Delaware's gender identity protections and hate crimes legislation, McBride worked on the LGBT Progress team at the Center for American Progress. McBride has spoken at a number of colleges and LGBT events, including the Human Rights Campaign National Dinner, the Human Rights Campaign Los Angeles Dinner, the Victory Fund National Brunch, the University of Pennsylvania, and Gettysburg College. McBride was ranked the Most Valuable Progressive in Delaware by DelawareLiberal.net listed in the 2014 list of the Trans 100, and named one of the fifty upcoming millennials poised to make a difference in the coming years by MIC.com. A 2015 article in the New Statesman on transgender representation in elective office predicted McBride would be the first transgender American elected to high public office. McBride was a panelist at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's \"GLOBE Pride 2016\" on youth and workplace bullying. McBride has been featured in The New York Times, The Huffington Post, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, Al Jazeera, PBS NewsHour, Teen Vogue, North Carolina Public Radio, The New Yorker, MSNBC, ThinkProgress, Buzzfeed, and NPR. In April 2016, McBride delivered a TED Talk titled, \"Gender assigned to us at birth should not dictate who we are.\" She also served on the steering committee of Trans United for Hillary, an effort to educate and mobilize transgender people and their allies in support of Hillary Clinton. On July 28, 2016, McBride became the first openly transgender person to speak at a national party convention when she spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. In her speech, which lasted less than four minutes, McBride paid tribute to her late husband Andrew Cray and his commitment to LGBT rights."

If passed, workers will be eligible to receive up to 80% of their current wages or a maximum of $900 per week. The paid family and medical leave program would be paid for through automatic payroll contributions of less than 1%. The weekly payroll deduction would be split between an employer and the employee. Businesses with less than 20 employees would not have to pay the employer share; however, their workers would still benefit from the program if and when they need it. The bill will have a fiscal note attached to it, however, those costs aren't yet known. There will be a one-time cost for the state to set up the program, but contributions will fund both the administration of the program and the benefit going forward."

Prior to teaching, she was the Associate Director of Georgetown University Law Center's Institute for Public Representation, where she engaged in and supervised litigation before the Federal Communications Commission and federal courts, including the US Supreme Court. As a pioneer and trailblazer in spaces that did not traditionally welcome Black women, her career was not without challenges and controversy. For example, in 2003, her provost and vice president of academic affairs appointment was erroneously challenged due to her perceived lack of experience and education, which was later reported as an error by the Washington Times. Her appointment was defended by the President of the University of the District of Columbia at the time, William L. Pollard."

During the early part of his career Chuck was able to coach his younger brother Joe and in 1993, while still coach, Delich retired from military service as a Major. Delich stepped down as coach after the 1996\u201397 season, turning the reigns over to Frank Serratore.

The daughter of Dutch-born classical scholar Nicholas P. Vlachos - a professor at Temple University -  Westcott was born in Philadelphia and raised in the area, graduating from Swarthmore High School. While on summer vacation in Avalon (New Jersey) - after attending Swarthmore College for a year - she met and eloped with Richard J. Westcott in 1931, the couple then residing in Camden (New Jersey) where Jan Westcott became a \"stay at home mom\" to the couple's two sons. Her longstanding interest in history, passed down from her father, was reinforced by the occurrence of World War II and after her husband left to join the army in 1943 Westcott tried her hand at writing a historical novel, which she worked on while her sons were in school and after putting them to bed: the resultant novel: The Border Lord, was published in 1946. Divorcing her first husband in 1947, Westcott in 1954 married Robert Phelps Barden the chief radiologist of Chestnut Hill Hospital (Philadelphia): the couple - who had met while both were summering in Avalon - subsequently resided for many years in Philadelphia's Chestnut Hill neighborhood. Westcott, whose fifth novel: The Walsingham Woman, had been published in 1953, had a lower-volume writing career during her second marriage with her eleventh and final novel: A Woman of Quality, being published in 1978, thirty-two years after Westcott's inaugural novel and thirty-three years before the author's passing at age 99. While promoting her 1969 novel The White Rose - the result of three years work - Westcott asserted doing thorough research for her novels via the UPenn library. Westcott was indeed praised by some reviewers for her attention to detail - one notice for Captain Barney stated \"[she] gets her inspiration from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" -  although others questioned the authenticity of her books. Nevertheless, The Border Lord became a Literary Guild selection, and The Queen's Grace was serialized in the Ladies' Home Journal. Westcott's first two novels in particular were successful, both The Border Lord and Captain For Elizabeth (1948) ranking as New York Times Bestsellers and reportedly each selling a million copies. Cited as a source of inspiration by romance novelists Karen Harper, Shirlee Busbee, Susanna Kearsley, and Bertrice Small. Jan Westcott had had her papers archived at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University."
