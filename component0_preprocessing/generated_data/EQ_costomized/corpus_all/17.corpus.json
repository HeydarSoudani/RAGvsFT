The monument is located within Deland Park along the Lake Michigan shoreline of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, which contains one of the larger Hmong communities in the United States. It was dedicated on July 15, 2006. Sheboygan was among the first United States cities to accept Hmong asylum seekers and immigrants in late 1976, after the victory of a communist government in Laos.\nThe memorial is intended to honor and memorialize all the Hmong who fought against communism. It includes 24 panels dedicated to military personnel who were a part of the Hmong Secret Guerrilla Unit Army that fought against the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) in the Secret War, as well as all civilian participants. The monument was vandalized in 2008. In June 2010, a painted centerpiece (pang dao) was added, consisting of a green circle with traditional white needlework.The United States did not acknowledge the Secret War until 1997, under the administration of President Bill Clinton, as a result of Hmong and Congressional pressure. In 2004, following several years of pressure from a coalition of U.S. conservatives and liberal human rights activists, the U.S. government reversed a policy of denying immigration to Hmong who had fled Laos in the 1990s for refugee camps in Thailand. In a major victory for the refugees, the US government recognized some 15,000 Hmong as asylum seekers and afforded them expedited U.S. immigration rights."

This originally included current North Elba, but that was split in 1849 from the original Keene. The area is mountainous with bedrock close to the surface in most areas, leaving little arable land. It has a low population due to the unsuitable and often unstable soil in the region. A road along the Ausable River from Jay was extended south to Keene Center about 1797, but it was often deemed almost impassible due to the structure of the area. The town of Keene organized the first school district in the Adirondacks, which held its first recorded trustee meeting in 1813.:\u200a32\u200aEarly development in the area was based on lumber and iron extraction; however, exporting lumber was difficult due to lack of transportation, and most was used locally. The first sawmill was built in 1823 and was quickly followed by forges and gristmills. The riverbed region of Keene sprouted the first community, Keene Central, and Keene Flats (renamed Keene Valley in 1883) was developed by 1840. In 1892, after the Adirondack Mountain Reserve acquired the land, a privately tolled and maintained road to Lower Ausable Lake was constructed.In 2011, the town completed a grassroots project to bring broadband service to more than 97% of the homes in Keene, and installing the service in every home with a student in the town's public school. The extension of this network into rural areas makes it unique in the Adirondack Park.The Hurricane Mountain Fire Observation Station, Slater Bridge (St. Huberts) and Walton Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places."

To solve this problem and to comply with an ongoing desegregation plan ordered by the US Department of Justice, LEAP (Lubbock Exemplary Academic Program) was developed. This college preparatory program offers advanced classes in mathematics, science, English, and history. Counselor Nancy Phillips was instrumental in the initial success of the LEAP Program. In its initial design, the LEAP plan included several incentives to attract students from outside the school's geographic district. These included unique classes not offered at that time in other Lubbock high schools, including Russian, Portuguese, Mandarin Chinese, Western Cultures, Marine Biology, and Calculus, among others. Additionally, the school offered trips to relevant locations in conjunction with specific classes.  For example, students in the Western Cultures class spent 15 days in western Europe at the close of the school year. Due to pressure from parents with students in other high schools in the district, some of these incentives were phased out by the school board in the 1983\u20131984 academic year.1983 saw the addition of the \"Friday Enrichment Schedule,\" wherein students attended academic classes Monday through Thursday (for longer hours than other high schools in Lubbock) and attended either \"enriching classes\" (e.g. \"Reading for Pleasure,\" \"French Club,\" etc.) or review classes from 8 am until noon on Fridays. The Friday Enrichment Schedule was altered to exclude the \"enriching classes\" in favor of shortened academic classes in 2007. The school switched to an \"abbreviated\" Texas Friday schedule with classes ending at 1:35 on Fridays. This schedule was changed in 2017 to ending at the regular time of 3:55, then changed again in 2021 with classes ending at 4:10. Starting in the 2022-2023 school year, classes began to be shortened on Wednesdays with first classes starting at 9 am; other days retain normal schedules. Along with the \"Friday Enrichment Schedule,\" a program was instituted in 1983 that allowed junior or senior students to take courses at Texas Tech University or South Plains College for dual credit.In 1996, Lubbock High was named as a Blue Ribbon school.Lubbock High School began its International Baccalaureate classes during the 2000\u20132001 school year.\nLubbock High School implemented the AP Capstone Diploma Program in 2018."

        "content": "The Bull Stone House is located in the Town of Hamptonburgh, New York. It is a ten-room stone house built in the 1720s by William Bull and Sarah Wells, pioneer settlers of Central Orange County, NY. It is one of the few homes in America still owned and occupied by the same family. The current resident is a ninth generation descendant of the couple.\nBull, a stonemason, met and married Wells in the Wawayanda Patent (much of the present day towns of Goshen, Hamptonburgh, Minisink, and Warwick) while they were both working for the patent proprietors.\nSarah Wells, an orphan, arrived in the area as the Goshen's first female settler in 1712. She came there to work as an indentured house servant at the age of sixteen.  In 1715 Bull arrived in North America from Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England and also came to work on the Wawayanda Patent, where they met. He was the hired mason for Daniel Crommelin, a French immigrant and New York City merchant.\nTheir marriage in 1718, was the first between European settlers in Goshen. Building the house was a joint effort between husband and wife. William bought 100 acres in 1718 adjacent to Christopher Denne's land. Denne was Sarah Wells' master. Eventually, the widow Elizabeth Denne sold 100 acres to William and Sarah's first son, John, when he was just 8 years old. It is family lore that the widow was fulfilling a promise Denne made to Sarah to convince her to act as his land agent in the land claim. The Bull Stone House still stands today and is in the possession of the William Bull and Sarah Wells Stone House Association.\nWhen construction began, Sarah carried some of the stones to the site and William cut and laid them, while they lived in a temporary log cabin. It took thirteen years to complete, surviving a 1727 earthquake in the process. (Other sources place the date of the house's construction as 1722 or 1727). The completed building stands 40 feet square (1,600 sq ft (150 m2)) and has walls 2 feet thick.The house was reportedly used as a safe haven during the seven years of the French and Indian War though no known fighting or battle was waged on the property. Sarah and William raised 12 children to adulthood in the house. Each of the children married and had children of their own.\nWilliam built many stone houses around what is now known as Orange County. In the last year of William's life, 1756, he completed a stone house in New Windsor now called Knox Headquarters, which was the headquarters of several American generals during the American Revolution.\nTheir descendants dispersed within the adjacent region, with the houses of Thomas (now a county museum) and William III also on the National Register. The family has lent its name to the hamlet of Bullville and Thomas Bull Memorial Park.\nSarah Wells survived William Bull, who died in 1755\u201356. She remarried Johannes Miller sometime between 1756 and 1769, but separated from him in 1770. She moved back to her Stone House, where she died at the age of 100 years and 15 days, leaving 335 direct descendants. The county government has renamed Orange County Route 8, near the house, to Sarah Wells Trail, in her honor. The local Girl Scouts council was named for her as well.Both Sarah and William are buried on the property next to Hamptonburgh Cemetery on Sarah Wells Trail.\nThe house and surrounding property have remained in the Bull family's ownership. In 1920 the family incorporated as an association of descendants. Today a ninth-generation descendant lives at the house as the resident family caretaker. Tours are available for the general public for a small fee. Descendants from all over the United States have returned to the house every year since 1868 for a family reunion. The house has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1974.\nThe 120-acre (49 ha) William Bull and Sarah Wells homestead boasts another historical structure of significance, a New World Dutch barn."

Lake Gleneida is a controlled lake, created when an original pond was dammed in 1870, once more part of the Croton Watershed.

It was formed following Britain\u2019s declaration of war on the German Empire on 15 August 1914, with an initial strength of one infantry division. The division subsequently fought at Ypres on the Western Front, with a newly raised second division reinforcing the committed units to form the Canadian Corps. The CEF and corps was eventually expanded to four infantry divisions, which were all committed to the fighting in France and Belgium along the Western Front. A fifth division was partially raised in 1917, but was broken up in 1918 and used as reinforcements following heavy casualties."

In 1918 the militia personnel active in Canada were granted Canadian Expeditionary Force status, to simplify administration in the wake of conscription coming into force.  Beginning in 1918, in anticipation of the disbandment of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, plans for the re-organization of the militia were initiated, guided largely by the deliberations of the Otter Commission, convened for this purpose. Among the commission's recommendations was a plan by which individual units of the Canadian Militia, notably infantry and cavalry regiments, would be permitted to perpetuate the battle honours and histories of the Canadian Expeditionary Force units that had fought during the war.During the latter part of the war, the Canadian Military Hospitals Commission reported on provision of employment for members of the Canadian Expeditionary Force on their return to Canada, and the re-education of those who were unable to follow their previous occupations because of disability."

The standard issued rifle was, at the beginning of the war, the Ross Rifle, which was later replaced by the Short Magazine Lee-Enfield Mark III (SMLE). This was due to problems of the Ross Rifle in comparison to the reliability of the SMLE, with unofficial replacement already occurring until the switchover in 1916. The service pistols issued were the Colt New Service, M1911 pistol, and the Smith & Wesson Triple Lock. Approved private purchase and secondary side-arms were the Webley Mark VI, and the Enfield revolver. Infantrymen were issued with the Ross bayonet, and later the Pattern 1907 bayonet. Machine-guns initially included the Colt and Vickers machine-guns, with the Vickers line continually expanded during the war, and which were complemented by the Lewis machine gun.\nOfficially an infantry division would be classified at full animal strength at 5,241 horses and mules; 60.7 percent or 3,182 of these animals were part of the infantry division's artillery branch. Besides mounted and cavalry units, the Canadian Expeditionary Force used horses, mules, donkeys and cattle to transport gun pieces on the battle front, as motorized vehicles could not handle rough terrain. At the start of the war over 7,000 horses were brought over to England and Europe from Canada and by the end of the war over 8 million horses had been lost in the course of fighting in Europe. Dogs and carrier pigeons were employed as messengers in the front. With horses, wagons were also used to transport equipment as well."

The 1,340-hectare site provides habitat for a variety of species, including 22 species of orchids. The organization\u2019s first project outside Ontario was Sight Point on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, in 1971. \nThe organization has now conserved more than 1,000 properties from coast to coast to coast, including the 5,300-hectare Old Man on His Back Prairie and Heritage Conservation Area in Saskatchewan, the 11,000-hectare Waterton Park Front in Alberta, and the 55,000-hectare Darkwoods Conservation Area in British Columbia, the largest single private conservation project in Canadian history. The Darkwoods Forest Carbon Project is NCC\u2019s third-party certified carbon credit program. \nNCC has spearheaded several campaigns to raise awareness and funding for evidence-based nature conservation. The Natural Areas Conservation Program (NACP), launched in 2007, was a public-private partnership between the Government of Canada and NCC, along with program partners Ducks Unlimited Canada and Canada\u2019s land trusts. Administered by NCC, the program allowed partners to match federal investment at a two-to-one ratio with contributions from foundations, corporations, individuals and other levels of government. In 2019, the NACP was succeeded by the Natural Heritage Conservation Program (NHCP), a four-year partnership with a $100 million commitment from the federal government. To date, this important partnership has leveraged nearly $400 million in investment from the Government of Canada with more than $800 million in matching contributions. The result is more than $1.2 billion in conservation outcomes including the protection of nearly 700,000 hectares for more than 200 endangered species \u2014 an area slightly larger than Banff National Park. \nLaunched in 2007, the Force For Nature Campaign raised more than $500 million for land conservation, with Ryan Reynolds, Jason Priestley, William Shatner and other Canadian celebrities appearing in a series of commercials promoting the campaign.\nThe Landmark Campaign launched in 2013 with a goal of raising $750 million for conservation across Canada. It was completed in 2020 with more than 110,000 donors contributing. The Landmark Campaign resulted in 540 new conservation projects completed across Canada, totaling 115,000 square kilometers and protecting habitat for 130 species at risk, including seven that are endemic \u2014 meaning they are found only in Canada.\nIn April 2022 the NCC announced its largest project to date: the Boreal Wildlands. The 145,000-hectare site consists of more than 100 freshwater lakes, rivers and streams, peatlands, swamps, and mixed forests. \nLocated near the town of Hearst in Northern Ontario, the area is home to species of flora and fauna, including lynx, black bear, moose, and the threatened boreal caribou, as well as hundreds of species of migratory and resident birds. \nThe carbon sequestered in the soil and trees is estimated to be equivalent to the lifetime emissions of three million cars. \nNCC is purchasing the land from pulp and paper manufacturer Domtar. Once completed, it will be the largest private land conservation project in Canada\u2019s history. As of May 2022, the NCC has raised 70% of its $46-million goal to purchase and maintain the land. \nThe Boreal Wildlands project is within the Treaty 9 (James Bay Treaty) lands."

It is open weekday mornings, but reservations must be made in advance and an admission fee is charged.\nThe garden's site was formerly a Royal palace of Portici built 1738-1748 by Charles III of Spain, King of Naples and Sicily. After the Bourbons' departure in 1860, today's gardens were founded in 1872 with the Royal Higher School of Agriculture. The park was enlarged by a further 36 hectares at that time, and two ornamental gardens (about 9000 square meters) created, which were then transformed into botanical gardens by Nicola Antonio Pedicino, the school's first botany professor. In 1935 the school became part of the University of Naples, and subsequently occupied by allied troops during World War II, destroying many plants, but from 1948 its collections have been restored and enlarged.\nThe gardens currently contain over 4000 specimens representing about 1000 species. The most important collection are desert plants, which include over 600 species from Agavaceae, Aizoaceae, Cactaceae (about 400 species), Didiereaceae, and Euphorbiaceae. Of particular interest are the Gymnocalycium, Mammillaria, and Rhipsalis; Alluaudia, Aloe, and Kalanchoe from South Africa and Madagascar; and notable specimens of Welwitschia mirabilis from the South African desert. The garden also includes palms, ferns, conifers, carnivorous plants, and edible and medicinal plants, as well as a heated greenhouse for succulents (1000 m\u00b2)."

Wichers and his group were able to gain an exemption by selecting a heavily damaged mill known as De Zwaan that had been in operation in Vinkel Netherlands since being moved there in 1884 by a family named Van Schayk.  De Zwaan was at the center of a controversy, with three local agencies unable to determine the future of the damaged windmill. The Dutch government decided to sell it to Wichers for $2800, making De Zwaan the last windmill to leave the Netherlands. Windmill authorities in the Netherlands provided the City of Holland with the history of De Zwaan, noting that it had been built in Krommenie, Netherlands, in 1761 as a grain mill set on a raised base to better capture the wind.\nIn October, 1964, De Zwaan arrived aboard the Prins Willem van Oranje. It was unloaded at the Muskegon harbor and transported by truck to Windmill Island in Holland. It took approximately 6 months to reconstruct the mill. The city erected a raised base rather than the mound of earth it had been set on in Vinkel so as to restore it to its original design when it stood in Krommenie. Once erected, the City of Holland celebrated as having been over 200 years old at the time.\nIn April 1965, the 125-foot (38 m) windmill was formally dedicated on Windmill Island, a 36-acre (150,000 m2) site reclaimed from a swamp on the eastern end of Lake Macatawa. It is open from late April through early October.\nWhen winds are favorable (15 to 20 mph (7 to 9 m/s) from the west), De Zwaan's 80-foot (24 m) diameter blades are usually in motion.\nIn 2015, the City of Holland celebrated the 50th anniversary of De Zwaan being in Holland. In preparation for the celebration, De Zwaan's resident Miller and historian, Alisa Crawford, set out to author the only definitive book ever written about De Zwaan.  Alisa Crawford holds a master\u2019s degree in museum studies and is the only Dutch certified miller in the United States, an accreditation she earned after years of independent study while working for the City of Holland at De Zwaan. In seeking data about De Zwaan\u2019s original construction, Crawford learned that  the De Zwaan in Krommenie had been taken down in 1887, which was three years after De Zwaan had been relocated to Vinkel. She realized that there had, in fact, been at least two windmills in the Netherlands named De Zwaan.\nUltimately Crawford was able to prove the De Zwaan windmill moved to Holland, Michigan, had originally been erected in the city of Dordrecht in South Holland as a zaagmolen (sawmill) in 1833. The mill was converted to steam power in 1884 and its eight-sided body, cap, and blades become superfluous. At that point the Van Schayk family purchased it for relocation to Vinkel. They also purchased parts from a different mill, likely the Nooitgedacht (Never Thought) that had been built in 1800 in 's-Hertogenbosch (now Den Bosch), and dismantled in 1883.  \nThis information led to the understanding that De Zwaan was about 70 years younger than the City of Holland was led to believe when it acquired the windmill in 1964 and was a hybrid mill built from the structure and components from two to three other mills. Crawford notes \"that lineage is what makes De Zwaan unequivocally authentic. Windmills were and continue to be working machines. When they break, they are repaired. When the parts wear out, they are replaced.  When they became outmoded, they are repurposed.\"   \n\nThere is, unfortunately, a lot of inaccurate information in newspapers published between 1964 and 2015 about the origins of De Zwaan. Additionally not all online sources have revised the original build date of De Zwaan."

The mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.\nThe City of Holland erected a State Historic Marker at De Zwaan in 2019. The text on one side reads:\n\nIn 1961 Castle Park resort owner Carter P. Brown proposed the idea of creating a public park with \"an authentic Dutch windmill,\" a symbol of Holland's Dutch heritage. To do so, city officials needed permission from the Dutch government, which protects windmills as national monuments. Willard C. Wichers, Midwest director for the Netherlands Information Service, led negotiations with the Dutch over a three-year period. In June 1964 he traveled to the Netherlands to find a suitable mill and finalize arrangements to buy and move it. In Vinkel, North Brabant, stood a mill that had been built in 1884 using pieces from older Mills. Named De Zwaan (the Swan), it had been damaged during World War II and had deteriorated. Dutch officials allowed its sale but required that Dutch millwright Jan D. Medendorp supervise its relocation and restoration."

The two stations share studios with Rogers's local radio stations on Gateway Boulevard in Edmonton; CKEM-DT's transmitter is located near Yellowhead Highway/Highway 16A. The station also operates a rebroadcast transmitter (CKEM-DT-1, channel 4) in Red Deer.\nCKEM was built as part of A-Channel, the regional television service constructed by Craig Broadcast Systems in 1997. Broadcasting from studios downtown in the historic Hudson's Bay Building, it was the first new commercial TV station in Edmonton since 1974; its style of news and programming was young and aggressive. The station also broadcast Edmonton Oilers hockey for its first several years on air. Ratings settled into third place, above the CBC but behind the established stations in town, CFRN and CITV. However, the station lost ratings momentum following a five-month strike by unionized employees.\nCraig, overextended by its launch of Toronto 1 in 2003, sold itself to CHUM Limited, then-owner of Citytv, in 2004. CHUM moved other media properties into the Hudson's Bay Building, including a new radio station and Access Media Group; in 2005, the A-Channel stations took on the Citytv brand. Due to poor ratings and as part of a wave of layoffs, CHUM reduced the size of its local operation in Edmonton in 2006, cancelling the station's evening newscast. CHUM sold most of its assets to Bell Globemedia that same year; as Bell owned the CTV Television Network, the Citytv stations were spun off to Rogers. The station continued producing a morning newscast under the Breakfast Television brand until 2015 and reinstated evening local news programs in 2017."

It is built on a group of 126 islands that are separated by expanses of open water and by canals; portions of the city are linked by 472 bridges. The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). In 2020, around 258,685 people resided in greater Venice or the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 51,000 live in the historical island city of Venice (centro storico) and the rest on the mainland (terraferma). Together with the cities of Padua and Treviso, Venice is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million.The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC. The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for almost a millennium, from 810 to 1797. It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an important centre of commerce\u2014especially silk, grain, and spice, and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th. The city-state of Venice is considered to have been the first real international financial centre, emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest prominence in the 14th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. For centuries Venice possessed numerous territories along the Adriatic Sea and within the Italian peninsula, leaving a significant impact on the architecture and culture that can still be seen today. The Venetian Arsenal is considered by several historians to be the first factory in history, and was the base of Venice's naval power. The sovereignty of Venice came to an end in 1797, at the hands of Napoleon. Subsequently, in 1866, the city became part of the Kingdom of Italy.Venice has been known as \"La Dominante\", \"La Serenissima\", \"Queen of the Adriatic\", \"City of Water\", \"City of Masks\", \"City of Bridges\", \"The Floating City\", and \"City of Canals\". The lagoon and the historic parts of the city within the lagoon were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, covering an area of 70,176.4 hectares (173,410 acres). In view of the fact that Venice and its lagoon are under constant threat in terms of their ecology and the safeguarding of the cultural heritage, Venice's UNESCO listing has been under constant examination by UNESCO. Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork. Venice is known for several important artistic movements \u2013 especially during the Renaissance period \u2013 and has played an important role in the history of instrumental and operatic music; it is the birthplace of Baroque composers Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi.In the 21st century, Venice remains a very popular tourist destination, a major cultural centre, and has been ranked many times the most beautiful city in the world. It has been described by The Times as one of Europe's most romantic cities and by The New York Times as \"undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man\". However, the city faces challenges including an excessive number of tourists, pollution, tide peaks and cruise ships sailing too close to buildings."

In the mid-1500s the city's population was 170,000, and by 1600 it approached 200,000.In 2021, there were 254,850 people residing in the Comune of Venice (the population figure includes 50,434 in the historic city of Venice (Centro storico), 177,621 in Terraferma (the mainland); and 26,795 on other islands in the lagoon). 47.8% of the population in 2021 were male and 52.2% were female; minors (ages 18 and younger) were 14.7% of the population compared to elderly people (ages 65 and older) who numbered 27.9%. This compared with the Italian average of 16.7% and 23.5%, respectively. The average age of Venice residents was 48.6 compared to the Italian average of 45.9. In the five years between 2016 and 2021, the population of Venice declined by 2.7%, while Italy as a whole declined by 2.2%. The population in the historic old city declined much faster: from about 120,000 in 1980 to about 60,000 in 2009, and to 50,000 in 2021. As of 2021, 84.2% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant groups include: 7,814 (3.1%) Bangladeshis, 6,258 (2.5%) Romanians, 4,054 (1.6%) Moldovans, 4,014 (1.6%) Chinese, and 2,514 (1%) Ukrainians.Venice is predominantly Roman Catholic (85.0% of the resident population in the area of the Patriarchate of Venice in 2022), but because of the long-standing relationship with Constantinople, there is also a noticeable Orthodox presence; and as a result of immigration, there is now a large Muslim community (about 25,000 or 9.5% of city population in 2018) and some Hindu, and Buddhist inhabitants.\nSince 1991, the Church of San Giorgio dei Greci in Venice has become the see of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Italy and Malta and Exarchate of Southern Europe, a Byzantine-rite diocese under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.There is also a historic Jewish community in Venice. The Venetian Ghetto was the area in which Jews were compelled to live under the Venetian Republic. The word ghetto (gh\u00e8to), originally Venetian, is now found in many languages. Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice, written in the late 16th century, features Shylock, a Venetian Jew. The first complete and uncensored printed edition of the Talmud was printed in Venice by Daniel Bomberg in 1523. During World War II, Jews were rounded up in Venice and deported to extermination camps. Since the end of the war, the Jewish population of Venice has declined from 1500 to about 500. Only around 30 Jews live in the former ghetto, which houses the city's major Jewish institutions. In modern times, Venice has an eruv, used by the Jewish community."

        "content": "Venice's economy has changed throughout history. Although there is little specific information about the earliest years, it is likely that an important source of the city's prosperity was the trade in slaves, captured in central Europe and sold to North Africa and the Levant. Venice's location at the head of the Adriatic, and directly south of the terminus of the Brenner Pass over the Alps, would have given it a distinct advantage as a middleman in this important trade. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Venice was a major centre for commerce and trade, as it controlled a vast sea-empire, and became an extremely wealthy European city and a leader in political and economic affairs. From the 11th century until the 15th century, pilgrimages to the Holy Land were offered in Venice. Other ports such as Genoa, Pisa, Marseille, Ancona, and Dubrovnik were hardly able to compete with the well organized transportation of pilgrims from Venice.Armenian merchants from Julfa were the leading traders in Venice, especially the Sceriman family in the 17th century. They were specialized in the gems and diamonds business. The trade volume reached millions of tons, which was exceptional for 17th century. This all changed by the 17th century, when Venice's trade empire was taken over by countries such as Portugal, and its importance as a naval power was reduced. In the 18th century, it became a major agricultural and industrial exporter. The 18th century's biggest industrial complex was the Venice Arsenal, and the Italian Army still uses it today (even though some space has been used for major theatrical and cultural productions, and as spaces for art). Since World War II, many Venetians have moved to the neighboring cities of Mestre and Porto Marghera, seeking employment as well as affordable housing.Today, Venice's economy is mainly based on tourism, shipbuilding (mainly in Mestre and Porto Marghera), services, trade, and industrial exports. Murano glass production in Murano and lace production in Burano are also highly important to the economy.The city is facing financial challenges. In late 2016, it had a major deficit in its budget and debts in excess of \u20ac400 million. \"In effect, the place is bankrupt\", according to a report by The Guardian. Many locals are leaving the historic centre due to rapidly increasing rents. The declining native population affects the character of the city, as an October 2016 National Geographic article pointed out in its subtitle: \"Residents are abandoning the city, which is in danger of becoming an overpriced theme park\". The city is also facing other challenges, including erosion, pollution, subsidence, an excessive number of tourists in peak periods, and problems caused by oversized cruise ships sailing close to the banks of the historical city.In June 2017, Italy was required to bail out two Venetian banks \u2013 the Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca \u2013 to prevent their bankruptcies. Both banks would be wound down and their assets that have value taken over by another Italian bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, which would receive \u20ac5.2 billion as compensation. The Italian government would be responsible for losses from any uncollectible loans from the closed banks. The cost would be \u20ac5.2 billion, with further guarantees to cover bad loans totaling \u20ac12 billion."

Their ground, the Stadio Pier Luigi Penzo, situated in Sant'Elena, is the second-oldest continually used stadium in Italy.\nThe local basketball club is Reyer Venezia, founded in 1872 as the gymnastics club Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Costantino Reyer, and in 1907 as the basketball club. Reyer currently plays in the Lega Basket Serie A. The men's team were the Italian champions in 1942, 1943, and 2017. Their arena is the Palasport Giuseppe Taliercio, situated in Mestre. Luigi Brugnaro is both the president of the club and the mayor of the city."

In 1958, the Georgia Board of Regents made plans to redevelop the property where Pilgrim's was located sometime in the future, and instead of accepting a year-to-year lease, Gold sold the business to James Klemis and John Chaknis, who changed the restaurant's name to Junior's Grill. Junior's remained in its original location until 1967, when the Board of Regents exercised its option to redevelop. The restaurant was relocated down the street to what had formerly been a barbershop, across from Smith Dormitory.  The new location was much smaller than the original, and in 1987, Junior's expanded into the Engineer's Bookstore's former location next door. Soon after, the Georgia Tech Foundation purchased the property in preparation for the possibility that Atlanta would be an Olympic Games host city and gave Junior's a five-year lease. Demolition and construction for the 1996 Summer Olympics forced the restaurant to close in October 1993. Alumni, students and staff had petitioned to save Junior's and have the school find new premises for it. Renovations of the Bradley Building began in November 1993, and Junior's re-opened in that location in February 1994. Junior's closed indefinitely at 2:30pm on Thursday April 21, 2011."

Heritage Hills High School in Lincoln City, Indiana, was established in 1972, combining Dale High School with Chrisney High School. Students from Dale and Chrisney merged in the new building that opened in January 1973 and was dedicated in November that year.The school was built on part of the land grant originally owned by Thomas and Nancy Hanks Lincoln.In 1997, the school board hired Construction Control Inc., of Fort Wayne, to manage renovation and construction at Heritage Hills, including construction of a middle school as well as complete renovation of the existing high school and industrial arts buildings and remodeling of the school's athletic facilities. Early estimates of costs exceeding $13.5 million were revised to $12.5 million once the design phase was completed. Work began in March 1999, and according to Superintendent Ron Etienne, the original building had few permanent walls to accommodate an \"open classroom\" concept of school design, a concept out of favor more than two decades later. In 2001, renovations and remodeling were completed.In May 2020, long-time principal Nick Alcorn was honored on his retirement, following 32 years at Heritage Hills. The new administration includes Principal Jeff Cochren, Assistant Principal since 2009, and newly hired Assistant Principal Kate Kress."

A 600 feet (180 m) high, narrow escarpment extends south then southeastwards for a total of 55 kilometres (34 mi) from a short distance east of the border. It hems in east-facing small harbour town of as-Salum, continuing as an east-facing sea cliff further north. Land to the east is lower than that to the west and the east side has steep slopes. \nThe pass is centred 1.6 miles (2.6 km) inland from the closest part of the shore. It makes for a subtle wind gap in the escarpment for the east-west land route. It made for the southern Mediterranean coastal road useful to Mediterranean civilizations until the pass at as-Salum was enlarged after World War II.\nAmong veterans of Allied forces from 15 June 1941 and thereafter it was nicknamed Hellfire Pass.\nThe escarpment is known as Akabah el-Kebir \"great ascent\". To El-Edrisi it was known as \u02bfAqaba as-Sall\u016bm \"graded ascent\", whence the modern name of the gulf/bay and the town of Salum. To ancient Rome it was known as Catabathmus Magnus, in the peak of whose empire it divorced Aegyptus from Marmarica. The range was seen as a demarcator of Africa and Asia in some Hellenistic geography."

        "content": "In World War II, the engineered route up the escarpment had been destroyed and the pass had great strategic importance. The only ways westwards into Libya were to assault the pass or to out-flank it to the south.\nAfter the defeat of the Italian Tenth Army on 7 February 1941 during Operation Compass, the Italians were reinforced by German units (Afrika Korps under Erwin Rommel) and the British forces were forced out of Libya, leaving besieged garrison at Tobruk. On 14 April 1941, Rommel's main force reached Sollum and occupied the Halfaya Pass. Allied attempts to recapture the pass and relieve Tobruk followed.\nThe first attempt, on 15 May, was Operation Brevity. Rommel counter-attacked; the British withdrew and by 27 May the Germans had recaptured Halfaya Pass, a passage of time in which Major Edward Thomas earned his Military Cross. Supply shortages obliged the Germans to curtail their advance, so they dug in and fortified their positions at Halfaya with 88 mm guns. This was the anchor for the Axis positions, which opposed the Allied forces during the next allied attack.\nThis was Operation Battleaxe on 15 June. German armour was deployed to draw the British tanks (11th Hussars) onto the concealed 88mm guns and the first wave was cut down in a few minutes (11 out of 12 tanks were destroyed), earning the pass the nickname \"Hellfire Pass\". The German commander, Major Wilhelm Bach, in his conduct of the Axis defence of Halfaya Pass earned himself the nickname German: Pastor des Fegefeuers lit. transl.\u2009Pastor of Hellfire (an allusion to his peacetime occupation as a Lutheran minister and the English nickname Hellfire Pass). The commander of the larger Italian contingent, General Fedele de Giorgis, General Officer Commanding 55th Infantry Division Savona, was awarded the highest German decoration, the Knight's Cross for the defense he conducted. A British tank commander was last heard on the radio reporting, \"They are tearing my tanks apart.\"\nThe third attempt, Operation Crusader opened on 18 November, with an attack on Sidi Omar to the west of the pass and an attempt to outflank Rommel to the south and relieve Tobruk. This was achieved on 29 November. Rommel, now under pressure, on 7 December withdrew to El Agheila. Axis garrisons at Sollum, Bardia as well as the Pass were left behind, a temporary thorn in the Allies side. Isolated after the fall of Bardia on 2 January 1942, besieged by Commonwealth forces, cut off from supplies, and bombarded from the air and the sea, Bach and de Giorgis finally surrendered the Halfaya garrison of 4,200 Italians of the 55th Savona and 2,100 Germans, to the South African 2nd Infantry Division on 17 January 1942.The pass was scene of the accidental death of Major-General 'Jock' Campbell (VC), then commander of the British 7th Armoured Division. On 26 February 1942, a month after assuming command, his staff car overturned on the newly laid clay surface, killing him outright."

It drains more than one-quarter of the country as it winds along the northern edge of the Maya Mountains to the sea just north of Belize City (17\u00b032\u2032N 88\u00b014\u2032W). The Belize river valley is largely tropical rainforest.\nAlso known as the Old River, the Belize River begins where the Mopan River and Macal River join just east of San Ignacio, Belize (17\u00b011\u2032N 89\u00b004\u2032W). The Belize River \u2013 Mopan River Catchment contains over 45 percent of the population of Belize. The Belize River, in spite of 78 runs or rapids, is passable via the Mopan to the Guatemalan border. It served as the main artery of commerce and communication between the interior and the coast until well into the twentieth century, and has long been associated with forestry, of logwood (for dye) and of mahogany which survives in small stands.:\u200a111\u200aEarly on, loggers using the river encountered the Maya and had conflicts with them and with the Spaniards. In 1807 there was a request for \"arms and ammunitions\" for the loggers. In the late 1820s, the Methodist minister Thomas Wilkinson found three to four thousand men working at camps most of the year.:\u200a55\u200a By the late 19th century there were over 130 small settlements along the river. Burrell Boom just above Belize Town served as a catch-point for logs.\nToday the Belize River is a vital source of drinking water and other domestic use for the populations living along the river; however, water quality is degraded from sediment, nutrient loading, pesticides and other toxins. The major source of degradation is the extensive deforestation in the upper reaches of the Mopan River and non-sustainable agriculture. Karper and Boles have asserted: \"The greater Mopan/Belize River Catchment provides a prime example of a watershed under stress from extensive non-sustainable agricultural practices that have occurred within the region over the past three decades.\" Traditional slash and burn agricultural practices also contribute to watershed degradation."

It is about 28 kilometres (17 mi) northwest of the modern town of Duolun. The layout of the capital is roughly square shaped with sides of about 2.2 km (1.4 mi). It consists of an \"outer city\", and an \"inner city\" in the southeast of the capital which has also roughly a square layout with sides about 1.4 km (0.87 mi), and the palace, where Kublai Khan stayed in summer. The palace has sides of roughly 550 m (1,800 ft), covering an area of around 40% the size of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The most visible modern-day remnants are the earthen walls though there is also a ground-level, circular brick platform in the centre of the inner enclosure.\nThe city, originally named Kaiping (\u5f00\u5e73, K\u0101ip\u00edng, \"open and flat\"), was designed by Chinese architect Liu Bingzhong from 1252 to 1256, and Liu implemented a \"profoundly Chinese scheme for the city's architecture\". In 1264 it was renamed Shangdu by Kublai Khan. At its zenith, over 100,000 people lived within its walls. In 1369 Shangdu was occupied by the Ming army, put to the torch and its name reverted to Kaiping. The last reigning Khan Toghun Tem\u00fcr fled the city, which was abandoned for several hundred years.In 1872, Steven Bushell, affiliated with the British Legation in Beijing, visited the site and reported that remains of temples, blocks of marble, and tiles were still to be found there. By the 1990s, all these artifacts were completely gone, most likely collected by the inhabitants of the nearby town of Dolon Nor to construct their houses. The artwork is still seen in the walls of some Dolon Nor buildings.Today, only ruins remain, surrounded by a grassy mound that was once the city walls. Since 2002, a restoration effort has been undertaken."

        "content": "The Fucine Lake (Italian: Lago Fucino or Lago di Celano) was a large endorheic karst lake between 650 and 680 m (2,130 and 2,230 ft) above sea level and surrounded by the Monte Sirente-Monte Velino mountain ranges to the north-northeast, Mount Salviano to the west, Vallelonga to the south, and the Valle del Giovenco to the east-southeast. Located in western Abruzzo in central Italy, the town of Avezzano lies to the northwest, Ortucchio to the southeast, and Trasacco to the southwest of the historic lake. Once the third largest lake in Italy after Lake Garda and Lake Maggiore, it was finally drained in 1878.The plain is a geographical depression of tectonic origin formed during the Apennine orogeny between the Pliocene and Quaternary.To the west, Fucino borders the Palentini plains, while the Giovenco, Vallelonga, and Roveto valleys converge towards the Fucine plain. Due to the absence of outlets and the sudden variations in the water level causing floods or unhealthy drying, it was the subject of numerous attempts at regulation. The first partial draining of the endorheic basin was carried out by the Roman emperor Claudius in 52 CE. \nThe total draining of the Fucian basin was undertaken in the second half of the 19th century by Jean Fran\u00e7ois Mayor de Montricher, who expanded the hydraulic works of the Roman era by increasing the number of wells and expanding the vents and underground canals. These works and others drained Lake Fucino by 1878.\nAn improvement in socio-economic conditions followed its draining and the resultant plain is one of the most fertile vegetable growing areas in Italy. Products that have obtained European Protected geographical indication marks include the Fucino potato and the Fucino plateau carrot.Along the former Fucino shoreline, in addition to Avezzano (the largest city), are other populous municipalities including Celano and Pescina.\nIn addition to agriculture, the plain also hosts the Fucino Space Centre. The teleport commenced construction in 1963 by the Telespazio company and is used for the ground management of artificial satellites in orbit for telecommunications."

        "content": "The Fucine basin is the subject of numerous neotectonic, paleoseismological, archaeoseismological, and paleoenvironmental geological studies due to the peculiar \"visibility\" of its sediments and the structures relating to the formation and evolution of the basin itself. Over time, these characteristics have also helped interpret other Apennine sectors whose context was less clear.The Fucine is a large tectonic depression surrounded by normal and transtensional faults active in the upper Pliocene to Quaternary era. There is also a late Messinian to early Pliocene compressive deformational phase schematically attributed to four main units, roughly NNW-SSE in direction, converging to the east: \"Costa Grande- Monte d'Aria\", \"Monte Cefalone Monti della Magnola\", \"Rocche plateau - Aielli-Celano gorges\", and \"Monte Sirente\". These compressive structures deform underlying Mesozoic - Tertiary layers belonging to two depositional domains. The first groups together persistent sedimentation of a platform drowned in the Miocene and the second of areas drowned in the Mesozoic with persistent sedimentation of the slope and basin, the latter immediately northeast of the Fucino. Corresponding to the first domain, the bryozoan calcarenites of the Langhian - Tortonian rest, while there is a gap between the upper Cretaceous and the end of the lower Miocene. In the second domain, however, there is greater continuity until the middle Miocene. This discrepancy may have been created in conjunction with the disjunctive phase linked to liassic rifting which persisted until the middle Miocene.Alluvial-colluvial continental deposits emerge that can be attributed to the Plio-Pleistocene and Holocene, in particular in correspondence with the ancient lake bottom characterized by silty sediments.The Quaternary evolution of the basin is linked to the activity of two main faults, one in a NW-SE direction and western dip, tangent to the former lake to the southeast, and the other, tangential to the north, in a WSW-ENE direction and dip southern.The Abruzzo territory is characterized by considerable seismic activity, mainly linked to crustal distension processes. The Plio-Quaternary deformation field is still active."

        "content": "Lake Fucine was a karst lake system, whose only real tributary was the Giovenco river, entering the basin from the North East, just after the town of Pescina. The lake also collected, especially in the winter period, the waters of small-flow streams from the Velino-Sirente massif to the north and from the Vallelonga mountains to the south. The water level of the basin was regulated by the activity of the karst sinkholes, located mainly to the south on the slopes of the mountains such as that of Petogna near Luco dei Marsi. The absence of an effective outlet resulted in a high variability of the lake level. These fluctuations are attributable partly to karst drainage or tectonic movements affecting the area, but above all to climatic variations such as seasonal changes in precipitation and the degree of insolation, produced by the Earth's orbit (precession of the equinoxes and obliquity of the ecliptic).\n\nThe Romans knew the lake as Fucinus Lacus and founded settlements on its banks, including Marruvium. It was the site of the Battle of Fucine Lake in 89 BCE; however, while the lake provided fertile soil and a large quantity of fish, it was also believed to harbour malaria and having no natural outflow it repeatedly flooded the surrounding arable land.\nIn the 19th century variation of the lake was the greatest on record (12.69 metres of excursion in twenty years). During flood episodes the lake generally invaded only some flat areas at low altitude, such as that between Ortucchio and Venere dei Marsi to the south-east, and not the fans and terraces located at a higher altitude, albeit by a few metres, to the north and east. The geologist Carlo Giraudi located the shore line in the periods immediately preceding the last reclamation, on the Contour line at an altitude of 660.It is not possible to precisely establish the variations during protohistory, but they probably did not differ much from that of the 19th century. According to Giraudi between 33,000 and 18-20,000 years ago there was a general increase in the lake level, probably the highest level ever reached, followed by a lowering up to 7,500-6,500 years ago, a subsequent rise up to 5,000 years ago, a decrease up to 2,800 years ago, a rise up to 2,300 years ago, a decrease up to 1,800 years ago, which continued until the 17th century of our era, reaching historical limits. During the Little Ice Age in the period 1750 - 1861, the last important rise occurred.The waters are drained by a system of drainage channels, built in the plain after the Torlonian drainage and subsequent reclamation, which relate to the main drainage tunnel. This crosses Mount Salviano and pours its waters into the Liri river (Basin Authority of the Liri-Garigliano and Volturno rivers)."

The dam spanning the river is 54 m (177 ft) tall, and is built near the small town of Afobaka. Contrary to the reservoir's long official name, it was quickly rechristened Brokopondomeer by Dutch-speaking locals, after the town of Brokopondo 3 km (2 mi) further downstream from where the dam was constructed. The length of the dam, including secondary dams along the margins of the reservoir, is 12 km (7+1\u20442 mi). The watershed which feeds the reservoir is 12,200 km2 (4,700 sq mi) in area.The reservoir was put into service in 1965, but did not reach its optimal water level until 1971. Due to the great area of the reservoir, villages home to approximately 5,000 people had to be abandoned. The largest of these, the village of Ganzee, had approximately 1,200 residents. Most displaced residents were moved to new villages (Dutch: transmigratiedorpen) downstream from the dam, in many cases with the same names as the previously abandoned hamlets. The most important being Klaaskreek, Nieuw Ganzee, and Marshallkreek. A separate government operation, \"Operation Gwamba,\" was conducted to save animals from the soon-to-be lake bed.\nThe dam was constructed in order to provide electricity to plants involved in the processing of bauxite into alumina, and later into purer aluminum metal. These plants were operated by Suralco, the Suriname Aluminum Company, which is a daughter company of Alcoa. About 75% of the dam's electricity was used to power these plants, and the portion of the electricity produced by the dam was used to power Suriname's capital city, Paramaribo. Other advantages of the dam's construction, besides a boost to the aluminum industry, have included the development of the country's inland areas and the surrounding forests, the pushing back of the saltwater boundary in the Suriname River, better irrigation capabilities during times of drought, an increase in tourist activity, and an increase in ease of fishing."

The tuff quarry below the church was already in use in ancient times. In 943, Steffeln had its first documentary mention as villa stephelin. In 1222, steffele was listed in Pr\u00fcm Abbey\u2019s directory of holdings, the Pr\u00fcmer Urbar: The Count of Hochstaden held Steffeln as a fief. From the Hochstadens, Steffeln passed to the Lords of J\u00fcnkerath, and from them by marriage to the Schleidens. In 1282, Konrad von Schleiden sold Steffeln to Gerhard von Blankenheim. In 1489, 1501 and 1562, the Counts of Nassau and Vianden were the feudal lords. From the 16th century until 1794, the lesser lordship of Steffeln belonged to the lordship of Kronenburg under Luxembourgish Imperial territorial superiority. Between 1488 and 1593, the Counts of Manderscheid-Schleiden were enfeoffed with Steffeln. Through sale it found its way into Manderscheid-Gerolstein hands in 1617. After this line died out, Steffeln was held from 1693 to 1719 by the Manderscheid-Blankenheim line.\nThe castle, mentioned in 1282, on the tuff crags overlooking the village was converted in the 15th or 16th century into a compulsory-labour and toll estate for the Manderscheid toll station on the long-distance trade road running from Li\u00e8ge by way of Malmedy to Koblenz, and into a seat for the comital Schulthei\u00dfen. Part of the residential house is preserved (the back part of today\u2019s rectory). There was trade in \u201coven stones\u201d from the K\u00fcllenberg (mountain) and millstones from the Steffelberg. After a years-long lawsuit against the landlord, Count Karl of Manderscheid, a compromise was reached in 1638 before the High Court in Luxembourg, which secured what is today the extensive municipal forest for the dwellers of Steffeln.\nAfter the occupation of the lands on the Rhine\u2019s left bank by French Revolutionary troops in 1794 and the French annexation of the Austrian Netherlands between 1795 and 1797, Steffeln became the seat of a mairie (\u201cmayoralty\u201d) in the Canton of Kronenburg, the Arrondissement of Malmedy and the Department of Ourthe, whose seat was in Li\u00e8ge. In the course of the sweeping political changes in Europe in the wake of the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Steffeln passed as the seat of a B\u00fcrgermeisterei (\u201cmayoralty\u201d) to the Pr\u00fcm district in Prussia\u2019s new Rhine Province. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate on 7 November 1970, Steffeln was grouped into the Daun district, which has since been given the name Vulkaneifel. Amalgamated with Steffeln that same year were Auel and Lehnerath.Auel had its first documentary mention in 983. It and Lehnerath were held in the Middle Ages by the Counts of Manderscheid-Gerolstein."

It begins with scientific information on olive trees: its botanic features and traditional and innovative systems of olive-growing. A millstone with animal traction and a huge millstone with hydraulic traction show, together with pictures and didactic panels, the long evolution in oil extraction techniques.\nMythology related to olive oil is then dealt with. Great attention is paid to the goddess Athena who, according to Greek mythology, offered mankind the first domesticated olive tree. Masterpiece of this section is a red-decorated Attica alabastron (a type of pottery for holding oil) portraying the goddess Athena, ascribable to Foundry Painter (5th century B.C.). Other pieces of the collection are a tribute to Athena's civilizing action (as holder of technological knowledge) as to war, vessels, agriculture and housekeeping.\nThe third section concerns landscape. Most of Umbria is cultivated with olive trees. Such feature has always impressed travelers and visitors who, during their so-called Grand Tour, would record their emotions and interest in the landscape in their note-books, in sketches or descriptions. This section contains cadastres, maps and other objects recalling such Grand Tour. \nThe following rooms tell the traditional uses of olive oil: the most ancient (oil as a source of light) is documented through a number of oil lamps from the pre-Classical era to Neoclassicism. The remaining rooms describe how oil has been used in a wide range of sectors: ritual usage in Christianity, Islam and Judaism; usage in sport, food, scents and ointment preparation; sphragistics, weaving and wood-processing.\nThe last room of the museum gathers a variety of symbolic elements which, over the centuries, have contributed to consider olive oil and olive trees as sacred and gifted of magic and curative power."

McDowell was the son of James McDowell,  a native of County Longford in Ireland who was one of the few survivors of a malnutrition-plagued Atlantic crossing in 1729 funded by Charles Clinton, grandfather of future New York State governor DeWitt. Bound for Pennsylvania, the survivors landed instead in Cape Cod. Two years later, in 1731, they made their way to the Hudson Valley where they were the first settlers in the area they called Little Britain.Thomas B. McDowell was 44 when he became the first owner of record in 1803. He may have added some of the interior decoration, such as a wooden mantelpiece typical of that era's Federal style homes. Sometime in the 1810s, he rented the house out to James Alexander, another Irish immigrant who was noted in histories of the period for his skill as a weaver. His son Joseph described the parcel as being about 60 acres (24 ha) at that time.In 1845 Thomas B. McDowell left the house to his son Alexander, who mortgaged it heavily to pay his debts. By this means it eventually became the property of Alfred Denniston, who probably added the east side's bay window. He sold it to Agnes Corwin in 1871. It remained in her family until the late 20th century."

The minimal detail from the original house shows the influence of the waning Georgian style. The house may also have been influenced by Thomas McDowell's brief sojourn in New England after his arrival in America.Later styles are evident in some of the alterations. The wooden mantelpiece is a Federal hallmark, probably added during that style's rise in the early 19th century.

        "content": "After the railroad system reached Asheville in 1881, the population of the city grew from 2,000 to 10,000. In response to this population influx, Asheville began a public school system in 1888, which originally consisted of a high school and three elementary schools. The elementary schools were the Orange Street School (currently occupied by NC DOT offices), Queen Carson Elementary School (currently occupied by a bus garage) and Montford Avenue School (replaced by the current William Randolph Elementary in the early 1950s). The high school was located at the corner of Broadway and Woodfin Street, in what had been the private home of Nicholas Woodfin. After use for educational purposes ceased about 1923 this structure was the downtown YMCA until a new structure was built further east on Woodfin about 1970, and the old building torn down. The former high school campus is currently occupied by a bank. The City of Asheville built two structures in the early 1920s, Hall Fletcher in West Asheville and David Millard, on Oak Street, adjacent to First Baptist Church, which, together, were known as Asheville High School. The David Millard Campus occupied a portion of the grounds of a former girls' school, with the balance of the former school grounds covered by the Church. Athletic teams and extracurricular clubs were drawn from both campuses. The former site of David Millard is currently covered by One Oak Plaza and the extension of Charlotte Street, and the West Asheville campus is currently occupied by a new Hall Fletcher Elementary School. The current University of North Carolina at Asheville began in 1927 as a two-year college, known as Asheville-Biltmore College, using classrooms on the ground floor of David Millard.\nThe population of Asheville continued to grow in the late 1920s. By 1926 the school board agreed that \"a large, central high school plant\" was needed. A committee formed to locate a suitable location reported that it found \"only one site within the City of sufficient size, and of reasonable price \u2026 this tract of land lies between Victoria Road and the new McDowell Street.\" Out of seven architects submitting proposals for the new high school, Douglas D. Ellington was selected by majority vote. In addition Nickolaus Louis Englehardt of Columbia University was hired as an advisor to the architect. Englehardt had worked a great deal in school planning and design on a national level. Ellington and Englehardt's collaboration made the new Asheville High a model facility in terms of architecture and educational offerings. The former Asheville High School was renamed David Millard Junior High School and, together with Hall Fletcher, served as the city's junior high schools for a time.With a cost of $1.3 million ($18.8 million in 2016 dollars) Asheville High School opened on February 5, 1929, with a dedication ceremony in the auditorium including as speakers the Mayor of Asheville, the superintendent of Asheville City Schools, Douglas Ellington, Lee H. Edwards, the president of the PTA, the Headmaster of the Asheville School and the president of Duke University. When first opened, Asheville High had a wide variety of vocational programs including automotive mechanics, full print shops (all yearbooks, newspapers, and magazines were printed on-campus), mechanical drawing, and photography, including a darkroom.\nWhen the stock market crashed in October 1929, it took Asheville by surprise. This forced the programming for the schools, and indeed the city's economic well-being, to hit rock bottom. For a time, Asheville High was closed, and students were removed to David Millard and Hall Fletcher. All extras were cut for a time, including much of the school's technical curriculum. In 1935 the school was renamed Lee H. Edwards High School in honor of Principal Edwards, who died unexpectedly that year. The name \"Asheville High School\" returned with integration in 1969.In 1949, another vocational facility (known today as the ROTC building) was created across from the original shop wing. This facility was built by students in the vocational program, as a real-world example of construction. In 1968, another larger vocational building was built. In the early 1970s, a media center addition was added to the main building. In 1973, a new gym and athletic facility was attached to the old vocational building. In the early 1990s, a $3.5 million cultural arts building was built. Finally, in 2006, a new $3.1 million cafeteria was added to the campus.On October 5, 2008, then Senator Barack Obama visited Asheville High School in his race for the White House. Over 25,000 people showed up at the Football Stadium to see Obama deliver his rally speech.In 2016, city school officials identified $25 million in needed repairs. The biggest problem was the roof, with thousands of clay tiles which would all have to be removed (and possibly replaced afterward) for the work. Jack Thomson, executive director of the Preservation Society of Asheville and Buncombe County, called the building \"a master work of Ellington.\" Over the next few years a $27 million restoration project was undertaken that included repairs to the mortar work, switching out the copper gutters, and replacing the Ludowici roof tiles."

Susanna\", possibly for his men's social club. The song was first performed by a local quintet at a concert in Andrews' Eagle Ice Cream Saloon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 11, 1847. It was first published by W. C. Peters & Co. in Cincinnati in 1848. Blackface minstrel troupes performed the work, and, as was common at the time, many registered the song for copyright under their own names. As a result, it was copyrighted and published at least twenty-one times from February 25, 1848, through February 14, 1851. Foster earned just $100 ($2,774 in 2016 dollars) for the song, but its popularity led the publishing firm Firth, Pond & Company to offer him a royalty rate of two cents per copy of sheet music sold, convincing him to become the first fully professional songwriter in the United States.The name Susanna may refer to Foster's deceased sister Charlotte, whose middle name was Susannah."

The opening line refers to \"a banjo on my knee\", but the song takes its beat from the polka, which had just reached the U.S. from Europe. Writer and musician Glenn Weiser suggests that the song incorporates elements of two previous compositions, both published in 1846: \"Mary Blane\", by Billy Whitlock, and \"Rose of Alabama\", by Silas S. Steele. He points out that the melody of the verse of \"Oh! Susanna\" resembles that of \"Mary Blane\", and the opening of the chorus of \"Oh! Susanna\" is almost identical to that of \"Rose of Alabama\". Moreover, the story lines of both \"Oh! Susanna\" and \"The Rose of Alabama\" involve a lover going from one Deep Southern state to another with his banjo in search of his sweetheart, which suggests that Foster got the inspiration for his lyrics from Steele's song.The first two phrases of the melody are based on the major pentatonic scale. \nThe song contains contradictory lines such as \"It rain'd all night the day I left, The weather it was dry, The sun so hot I froze to death...\", which have been described as \"nonsense\". It is one of the songs by Foster that use the word \"nigger\" (others are \"Old Uncle Ned\" and \"Oh! Lemuel\", both also among Foster's early works), which appears in the second verse (\"De lectric fluid magnified, And kill'd five hundred nigger.\")."

President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, ordering people of Japanese ancestry to be incarcerated in what were euphemistically called \"relocation centers\" like Topaz during World War II. Most of the people incarcerated at Topaz came from the Tanforan Assembly Center and previously lived in the San Francisco Bay Area. The camp was opened in September 1942 and closed in October 1945.\nThe camp, approximately 15 miles (24.1 km) west of Delta, Utah, consisted of 19,800 acres (8,012.8 ha), with a 640 acres (259.0 ha) main living area. Most internees lived in the main living area, though some lived off-site as agricultural and industrial laborers. The approximately 9,000 internees and staff made Topaz into the fifth-largest city in Utah at the time. The extreme temperature fluctuations of the arid area combined with uninsulated barracks made conditions very uncomfortable, even after the belated installation of pot-bellied stoves. The camp housed two elementary schools and a high school, a library, and some recreational facilities. Camp life was documented in a newspaper, Topaz Times, and in the literary publication Trek. Internees worked inside and outside the camp, mostly in agricultural labor. Many internees became notable artists.\nIn the winter of 1942\u20131943, a loyalty questionnaire asked prisoners if they would declare their loyalty to the United States of America and if they would be willing to enlist. The questions were divisive, and prisoners who were considered \"disloyal\" because of their answers on the loyalty questionnaire were sent to the Tule Lake Segregation Camp. One internee, James Wakasa, was shot and killed for being too close to the camp's fence. Topaz prisoners held a large funeral and stopped working until administrators relaxed security.\nIn 1983, Jane Beckwith founded the Topaz Museum Board. Topaz became a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2007. After many years of organizing, fundraising, and collecting information and artifacts, the Topaz Museum was built in Delta and debuted with a display of the art created at Topaz. Permanent exhibits, installed in 2017, chronicle the people who were interned there and tell their stories."

A smaller camp existed briefly a few miles north of Moab, which was used to isolate a few men considered to be troublemakers prior to their being sent to Leupp, Arizona.  A site at Antelope Springs, in the mountains west of Topaz, was used as a recreation area by the residents and staff of Topaz."

The earliest inhabitants are the Agta, or Atta, food-gatherers who roam the forests without fixed abodes. A large tract of land has lately been returned to them. The bulk of the population are of Austronesian origin. For centuries before the coming of the Spanish, the inhabitants traded with Indians, Malays, Chinese, and Japanese. In the nineteenth and 20th centuries, the prosperity found in tobacco cultivation caused many Ilokano people to settle here, it was only in this large-scale Ilocano settlement that made Ilocano language replace Ibanag as the lingua franca of the region. Tobacco is still a major factor in the economy of Cagayan, though a special economic zone and free port has been created to strengthen and diversify the provincial economy.\nDuring the Spanish era, Cagayan Valley had a larger territory than today, then named Provincia de Cagayan. Then it included the territories of the above-mentioned provinces and the eastern parts of the Cordillera provinces of Apayao, Kalinga, Ifugao and Benguet, and the north part of Aurora. Historian and missionary Jose Burgues said, \"The old Cagayan Valley comprises the province of Cagayan, Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya as well as the military Districts of Apayao, Itaves, Quiangan, Cayapa and Bintangan, plus the area of the Sierra Madre to the Pacific Ocean in the said trajectory.\"During World War II, at Balete Pass in Nueva Vizcaya, the retreating Japanese Imperial Army under General Tomoyuki Yamashita dug in and held on for three months against the American and Filipino forces who eventually drove them out; the pass is now called Dalton Pass in honor of General Dalton, USA, who was killed in the fighting.\nWhen the Cordillera Administrative Region was formed in 1987 under Corazon Aquino, the indigenous provinces of Ifugao and Kalinga-Apayao were transferred into the newly formed region, until the latter was divided into 2 present provinces of Kalinga and Apayao in 1995."

Isabela was the 9th richest province in the Philippines in 2021, being the only province from the region to be included in the list.The city of Tuguegarao is the center of excellence in education, commerce, trade and culture and as the economic center of the region, the city continuously aims for outstanding performance and competence in administration, citizen participation, community and economic development, cultural arts, education, fiscal management, infrastructure, intergovernmental cooperation, planning, public safety, recreation and leisure services, social services, and technology. Its economy gradually shifted from agriculture to secondary/tertiary economic activities such as trading, commerce and services. The shift was ushered by city's role as the Regional Government Center and Center of Commerce in Northern Luzon.Tuguegarao City was included to be one of the digital cities for 2025 to sustain the rapid growth of the Information Technology and Business Process Management and to promote development in the city. The program (Digital Cities 2025) was created through a partnership between the DICT, the IT and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP), and Leechiu Property Consultants (LPC).Cauayan is a component city in the province of Isabela. It is dubbed as the Ideal City of the North and the host city for the proposed Isabela Special Economic Zone and the Regional Agro-Industrial Growth Center. It is the home of Cosmos Bottling Corporation, now acquired by the giant multinational business conglomerate San Miguel Corporation manufactures soft drinks in the area and the Mega Asia Bottling Corporation with its newly built plant for RC Cola brand. It is also here where the regional sales offices of several multi-national companies are located. As a young city, it has enormous potential for small to large enterprises and its real estate industry is just beginning. Medium size commercial centers or subdivisions are the appropriate ventures to put up.Ilagan is a component city and the capital of the province of Isabela. The city is the Corn Capital of the Philippines and has been considered as the Primary Growth Center of Region 2. Most of the industries in the city are agri-based. Over the past decades, there has been a great number of local investments in poultry and hog raising. There are several poultry contract growers and small and medium scale hog raisers in the city. Other support facilities, warehouses and small and big rice mills, strategically located in the different barangays of the city to address the storage needs of farmers during the harvest season. Of all cities in the country, Ilagan ranks as the top producer of corn. As an agriculture-based city, it produces ample supply of corn, rice, vegetables and legumes. Fruits like the banana are year-round products especially in the mountainous areas of the city. Ilagan also produces seasonal fruits such as mangoes and pomelo. Commerce and trade is considered to be the city's second economic-based income. It is also the hub of the Coca-Cola FEMSA Philippines, Inc., one of the industrial complexes in the region.Solano is a first class municipality and the main commercial and financial center of the province of Nueva Vizcaya. It also has the most fast food restaurants chains and the most banks among the municipalities in the entire region. According to the 2016 Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index conducted by the National Competitiveness Council, Solano took the 25th spot overall and ranked 30th among the first class and second class municipalities in the Philippines. This further solidified the status of Solano as the undisputed premier town of Cagayan Valley being the premier town in Nueva Vizcaya and the fastest-growing municipality in the region.Cagayan has several attractions which include beaches, swimming, snorkeling, skin-diving, fishing in the river and the sea, hiking in primeval forest, mountain-climbing, archaeological sites, the collection of the provincial museum, the Callao Caves, and many churches. \nThe Cagayan Economic Zone Authority (CEZA) is situated in Santa Ana, Cagayan.\nQuirino is the youngest province in the region. With its agricultural based nature, the vast vegetative agricultural covers reveal the major source of living of the people. Farming has been the main industry in the province, with rice and corn as major crops as with other provinces in the region. Virgin forest and wealthy bodies of water have been great contributors in its development. Small scale industries like furniture making, basketry, rattan craft, and dried/fossilized flower production, where the province was famously known, are prevalent. Banana products also sold in and out the province and also for export purposes. The small scale business and associations also make their own products like banana chips, peanuts, patupats and others. The province also produces a substantial amount of fruits/crops like mango, citrus, pineapple, coffee, coconut, papaya, lanzones, rambutan and vegetables.The province of Nueva Vizcaya has basically an agricultural economy with commerce, trade, and industry contributing to its growth and development. Among other major economic activities are farming and cattle and swine raising. Primary crops are palay and corn. The province produces quality onions and vegetables often sold in Metro Manila. Oranges and mangoes are now major crops being exported fresh to other Asian countries; earning its title as the Citrus Capital of the Philippines.Batanes is the northernmost and smallest province in the region as well as in the whole Philippines. It is the only province located outside the mainland Cagayan Valley. Due to its geographical location, fishing is considered as a major industry and source of livelihood for the people. Garlic and cattle are major export crops. Ivatans also plant camote (sweet potato), cassava, gabi or tuber and a unique variety of white uvi. Sugarcane is raised to produce palek, a kind of native wine, and vinegar. Tourism also contributes to the province's thriving economy."

        "content": "The Central Business District (CBD) is a neighborhood of the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States.\nA subdistrict of the French Quarter/CBD area, its boundaries, as defined by the City Planning Commission, are Iberville, Decatur and Canal Streets to the north; the Mississippi River to the east; the New Orleans Morial Convention Center, Julia and Magazine Streets, and the Pontchartrain Expressway to the south; and South Claiborne Avenue, Cleveland Street, and South and North Derbigny Streets to the west. It is the equivalent of what many cities call their downtown, although in New Orleans \"downtown\" or \"down town\" was historically used to mean all portions of the city downriver from Canal Street (in the direction of flow of the Mississippi River). In recent decades, however, use of the catch-all \"downtown\" adjective to describe neighborhoods downriver from Canal Street has largely ceased, having been replaced in usage by individual neighborhood names (such as Bywater).Originally developed as the largely-residential Faubourg Ste. Marie (English: St. Mary Suburb) in the late 18th century, the modern Central Business District is today a dynamic, mixed-use neighborhood, the home of professional offices in skyscrapers, specialty and neighborhood retail stores, numerous restaurants and clubs, and thousands of residents inhabiting restored, historic commercial and industrial buildings.\nA part of the area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the New Orleans Lower Central Business District."

        "content": "Streets in the Central Business District (originally Faubourg Ste. Marie) were initially platted in the late 18th century, representing the first expansion of New Orleans beyond its original French Quarter footprint. Significant investment began in earnest following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, as people from other parts of the United States flocked to the city. Consequently, the district began to be referred to as the American Sector.\nWhile traditionally Canal Street was viewed as the dividing line between the French Quarter and the American Sector, legally both sides of Canal Street are today considered part of the Central Business District for zoning and regulatory purposes. Through the 19th and into the 20th century, the Central Business District continued developing almost without pause. By the mid-20th century, most professional offices in the region were located downtown, the hub of a well-developed public transit system.\nCanal Street was the primary retail destination for New Orleanians, as well as for residents of the surrounding region. Local and regional department stores Maison Blanche, D.H. Holmes, Godchaux's, Gus Mayer, Labiche's, Kreeger's, and Krauss anchored numerous well-known specialty retailers, such as Rubenstein Bros., Adler's Jewelry, Koslow's, Rapp's, and Werlein's Music. National retailers, like Kress, Woolworth, and Walgreens were present alongside local drugstore K&B. Sears operated a large store one block off Canal, on Baronne Street.\nBookstores, theaters, and movie palaces also abounded, with the neon marquees of the Saenger, Loews State, RKO Orpheum, Joy, and Civic theaters nightly casting multi-colored lights onto surrounding sidewalks.\nIn the 1950s, six-lane Loyola Avenue was constructed as an extension of Elk Place, cutting a swath through a low-income residential district and initially hosting the city's new civic center complex. The late-1960s widening of Poydras Street was undertaken to create another six-lane central area circulator for vehicular traffic, as well as to accommodate modern high-rise construction. The City of New Orleans partook in transforming the district from 1973 to 1993, in a collaboration between public and private sectors to spark active community participation.The portion of the CBD closer to the Mississippi River and upriver from Poydras Street is known as the Warehouse District, because it was heavily devoted to warehousing and manufacturing before shipping became containerized.  The 1984 World's Fair drew attention to the then semi-derelict district, resulting in steady investment and redevelopment from the mid-1980s onward.  Many of the old 19th-century warehouses have been converted into hotels, restaurants, condominiums, and art galleries. For further information: Loft 523, a boutique hotel.\nNotable structures in the CBD include the Greek Revival Gallier Hall (the city's former city hall); Caesars Superdome; the Smoothie King Center; the city's present-day, International style city hall; and Hancock Whitney Center, the city's tallest building and headquarters for Royal Dutch Shell's Gulf of Mexico Exploration and Production.  Other significant attractions include the postmodern Piazza d'Italia, Harrah's Casino, the World Trade Center New Orleans, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, St. Patrick's Church, the Hibernia Bank Building, and the former New Orleans Cotton Exchange.\nThe principal public park in the CBD is Lafayette Square, upon which face both Gallier Hall and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Other public spaces include Duncan Plaza, Elk Place, the Piazza d'Italia, Lee Circle, Mississippi River Heritage Park, Spanish Plaza, and the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Plaza.\nMuseums include the National World War II Museum, the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, the Louisiana Children's Museum, the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center and Confederate Memorial Hall Museum.\nNew Orleans CBD was one of the few areas of New Orleans that escaped the catastrophic flooding of 2005's Hurricane Katrina."

The New Orleans Civic Center is today much diminished, with the Louisiana Supreme Court building having been torn down in the wake of the court's 2004 departure for the French Quarter, the Louisiana State office building having suffered the same fate, and Duncan Plaza itself having been fenced off.\nThe United States Postal Service operates the New Orleans Main Post Office at 701 Loyola Avenue in the CBD. \nThe Union Passenger Terminal is the terminus for three of Amtrak's long-distance trains, the City of New Orleans, the Crescent and, since 2005, the Sunset Limited (with the elimination, due to Katrina damage, of the eastbound portion of the Sunset Limited route), and also offers inter-city bus service via Greyhound Lines.\nInterstate Highway access is provided by I-10, via the Claiborne and Pontchartrain Expressways.  When I-10 curves to the east by the Louisiana Superdome and becomes the Claiborne Expressway, elevated above N. Claiborne Avenue, the Pontchartrain Expressway continues as U.S. Route 90 Business and crosses the Mississippi River on the twin-bridge Crescent City Connection.\nSignificant thoroughfares in the CBD include St. Charles Avenue, Camp Street, Carondelet Street, Gravier Street, Poydras Street, Tchoupitoulas Street, Howard Avenue, and Canal Street.  Prior to the 1980s, the intersection of Gravier and Carondelet streets was the de facto heart of the city's financial district.  Though still a vibrant area, that part of the CBD witnessed the migration of much business slightly upriver to Poydras Street, as many modern high-rise office towers were constructed there in the 1970s and 1980s.  The widening of Loyola Avenue, Poydras Street and O'Keefe Avenue aimed to simultaneously create an effective downtown circulator high capacity road network for automobile traffic and make room for large-scale redevelopment (e.g., Duncan Plaza, Superdome).  However, many of the development sites created in the wake of these improvements were never built upon, leaving a noticeable and unfortunate quantity of surface parking lots along these widened streets."

The early Spanish colonists referred to beaver as \"nutria\", perhaps because the Eurasian beaver had been extinct in Spain since the 17th century. On August 2, 1776 Francisco Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante wrote in his diary, \"...we halted in a small plain on the bank of another arroyo which is called Rio de las Nutrias, because, although it is of permanent and running water, apparently during all or most of the year it stands in pools where they say beavers breed.\" The first settlers in the area either killed an otter and a bear (Oso in Spanish) and took the name from that incident, killed a beaver and a bear and misused the term \"Nutria\" or killed just a beaver and used the term \"Nutrioso\" to mean \"Of Beavers\".Nutrioso rose in importance as Mormon refugees relocated here after other nearby settlements were attacked by Native American groups. By 1880, a fort had been constructed, and by 1883 a post office was established."

The original site is now the site of Riverlink shopping centre on The Terrace and the current site is used as a joint facility containing the Workshops Rail Museum. The suburb contains a large number of character and heritage listed houses, such as workers cottages that were home to the many railway workers.Ipswich North State School opened on 5 July 1867 with girls and boys taught in separate rooms. In 1876 it split into two separate schools: Ipswich North Boys State School and Ipswich North Girls and Infants State School. In 1934 the two school were amalgamated to form Ipswich North State School once again.A United Methodist Free Church opened in Canning Street on Sunday 22 March 1868. In July 1873 it relocated to Brisbane Street in the Ipswich CBD to leave the \"comparative obscurity\" of North Ipswich.Circa 1888-1889 an Anglican church opened in North Ipswich.In November 1900, approx.150 allotments were advertised as \"Railway Workshops Estate\", to be auctioned by Cameron Brothers auctioneers.On 1 March 1902, auctioneer E. Bostock offered 77 blocks in the \"New Workshops Estate\", of which 48 sold on the day. This estate was bounded by Albert Street to the west and north, by Tivoli Creek to the east, and Hill Street to the south. At that time the Tivoli railway line passed through the estate from north to south; the land corridor still exists but is now used a pedestrian path.St Joseph's School opened on 13 August 1913.In 1923 12 allotments were advertised for sale by Jackson & Meyers on Saturday, 7 July 1923. This area was called the \"Stirling Estate\" and was resubdivisions of subdivisions 1 and 2 of Allotment 5 of Section 45 in the parish of Chuwar. The land was bounded by Waterworks Road and Simmons Road in North Ipswich and according to the real estate map was within 10 minutes of the Railway Workshops. Later in 1923 it was advertised in the Queensland Times that there were still some allotments for sale.North Ipswich Uniting Church was originally located at 105 Downs Street, North Ipswich. It was previously the North Ipswich Presbyterian Church, until the Uniting Church in Australia was established in 1977.

It had ownership interests and brand partnerships with several carriers.\nContinental started out as one of the smaller carriers in the United States, known for its limited operations under the regulated era that provided very fine, almost fancy, service against the larger majors in important point-to-point markets, the largest of which was Chicago/Los Angeles. However, deregulation in 1978 changed the competitive landscape and realities, as noted by Smithsonian Airline Historian R. E. G. Davies, \"Unfortunately, the policies that had been successful for more than forty years under (Robert) Six's cavalier style of management were suddenly laid bare as the cold winds of airline deregulation changed all the rules\u2014specifically, the balance between revenues and expenditures.\"In 1981, Texas International Airlines acquired a controlling interest in Continental.  The companies were merged in 1982, moved to Houston, and grew into one of the country's largest carriers despite facing financial and labor issues, eventually becoming one of the more successful airlines in the United States.\nContinental and United Airlines merged in an $8.5 billion all-stock merger of equals on October 1, 2010. Continental's shareholders received 1.05 per share in United stock for each Continental share they owned. Upon completion of the acquisition, UAL Corporation changed their name to United Continental Holdings. During the integration period, each airline ran a separate operation under the direction of a combined leadership team, based in Chicago. The integration was completed on March 3, 2012. Although the merged airline retained the United name, it uses Continental's operating certificate and livery. On June 27, 2019, United changed its parent company name from United Continental Holdings to United Airlines Holdings."

        "content": "Continental, together with Continental Express and Continental Connection, offered more than 2,400 daily departures throughout the Americas, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The summer 2008 schedule saw Continental serving 130 domestic and 132 international destinations.Continental Airlines operated primarily a hub-and-spoke route network with North American hubs in Cleveland, Houston, and Newark, and a west Pacific hub in Guam. The majority of Continental flights were operated from its hubs. Some affiliated airlines used the Continental Connection name also operate flights not involving hubs, such as Gulfstream International Airlines, which operated intra-Florida and Florida-Bahamas services.\n\nFor almost 40 years, Continental operated a very large hub in Denver, Colorado, but took the decision to close that hub in 1995 immediately after the opening of Denver International Airport (DIA), which represented a significantly higher-cost operation than the former Stapleton Airport, which DIA had replaced. The abrupt nature of this change came as a shock to Denver, which was experiencing dramatic growth. The void left by Continental's departure allowed the establishment of the \"new\" Frontier Airlines (a startup, rather than the original carrier of that name). Both Frontier and Southwest Airlines (which entered the Denver market after Continental's dehubbing) expanded quickly to fill the vacuum created by Continental's closing of its Denver hub.\nFor the first forty years of its existence, Continental was a domestic airline; however, especially after the incorporation of Texas International routes, it served more Mexican destinations than any other U.S. carrier since the mid-1980s.Continental first entered the transatlantic market in April 1985, with the introduction of a Houston-London-Gatwick service. Long prevented from serving London Heathrow Airport because of the provisions of the Bermuda II agreement, which only allowed British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines and American Airlines to operate flights from Heathrow to the United States, Continental maintained its London services at Gatwick, where in 2007 as many as six flights a day were offered to Newark, Houston, and Cleveland.\nIn March 2008, an Open Skies Agreement between the U.S. and the European Union became effective, invalidating Bermuda II restrictions that had limited the number of carriers and cities in the U.S. that could serve London-Heathrow. In November 2007 Continental announced that new, nonstop, twice-daily service from its hubs at George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport to London-Heathrow would be offered; and this service was inaugurated on March 29, 2008. The service replaced existing frequencies to London-Gatwick and were offered with a combination of Boeing 777-200ER and 757-200 equipment, with flat beds guaranteed in the BusinessFirst cabin. By the time of its merger with United, Continental had grown its presence at London-Heathrow to seven daily flights; two to Houston-Intercontinental and five to Newark.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Continental's extensive military charter operations established a presence in the Pacific region that formed the basis for the Air Micronesia operation. Service to Japan was initiated in the 1970s from Guam and Saipan, and by the late 1980s, nonstop service between Seattle and Tokyo was briefly offered with 747 equipment, soon to be replaced with a direct Honolulu-Tokyo (Narita) flight. Through the 1990s, Continental maintained a minimal presence in the long-haul trans-Pacific market, until the delivery of 777-200ERs in 1998 which saw the addition of nonstop Tokyo service from Houston and Newark. By 2007, Hong Kong and Beijing were added to the network, and in 2009 Shanghai was added, all from the Newark hub. Continental has served Australia in the past with DC-10 and Boeing 747 service from Hawaii, with some flights via Auckland. Continental withdrew from much of the Australasian market, but continues Air Micronesia Boeing 737-800 services between Cairns and Guam on a 4x weekly basis. Beginning in June 2011, it initiated service to Hilo, Hawaii, providing that city the only nonstop air service to and from any destination outside the state of Hawaii.Continental offered the most destinations of any of the U.S. carriers to Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom, and was the only U.S. airline that flew to the Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, and Norway. Continental began service from Newark to Mumbai, India on October 1, 2007, making that city Continental's second Indian destination."

The company's daily aircraft utilization was usually at the top of the industry.As of October 1, 2010, at the time of the merger, the Continental Airlines fleet consisted of the following aircraft with an average age of 9.5 years:\nBy 2013, all of the former Continental fleet, excluding the Boeing 737-500 and Boeing 767-200ER (which were sold, primarily to Russian operators) were repainted in the new United livery, except for the one Boeing 737-900ER in the Continental Blue Skyway retro livery (N75436). United repainted this aircraft to the standard Globe livery in May 2016, and then painted a different airframe in the Blue Skyway, sister ship N75435. The reason for the change is currently unknown to the public.\nFirst Class was offered on Domestic Flights, and BusinessFirst was offered on Transatlantic/Transpacific Flights.\nContinental Airlines was one of three carriers (with American Airlines and Delta Air Lines) to sign an exclusivity agreement with Boeing in the late 1990s. When Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas, the European Union forced Boeing to void the contracts. Both parties had been adhering to the terms under a gentlemen's agreement.\nContinental was one of the first major airlines to fly Boeing 757s on transatlantic routes. There have been some instances of range limitations on west-bound transatlantic flights due to strong headwinds resulting in a fuel stop which does not appear on the timetable, but these stops are not common. The use of the 757 with its smaller seating capacity allowed for \"thin\" routes (routes with less passenger traffic) to be economically viable. It allowed nonstop service from smaller cities, such as Belfast, Northern Ireland and Hamburg, Germany to the New York gateway. Previously, customers originating at these and similar cities needed to connect at European gateways like London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, or Frankfurt, in order to travel to New York. United retains a number of these flight routes, mostly based out of Newark, including Newark-Dublin and Newark-Berlin."

        "content": "Established in 1987 in cooperation with now defunct Eastern Air Lines, OnePass was the frequent flyer program for Continental Airlines, the Trump Shuttle, Copa Airlines and Copa Airlines Colombia. OnePass offered regular travelers the privilege to obtain free tickets, First Class upgrades on flights, discounted membership for its airport lounge (President's Club), and other types of rewards. Customers accumulated miles from flight segments they fly or through Continental Airlines partners. OnePass elite tiers were Silver, Gold, and Platinum Elite which have benefits such as free upgrades, mileage bonus, priority check-in, priority boarding, and much more. Continental previously had a frequent flyer program prior to OnePass called TravelBank, which was started not long after American Airlines started its frequent flyer program in 1981 and when most large United States airlines followed, but this was merged with Eastern Airlines' frequent flyer program in 1987 to form OnePass. The name \"OnePass\" refers to the ability to accumulate miles on two major airlines, namely Continental and Eastern, in one frequent flyer program.\nIn addition to its Continental Express, Continental Connection and Star Alliance partnerships, Continental had frequent flyer partnerships with the following airlines (as of February 2012):\n\nAeromar\nCape Air\nCopa Airlines\nEVA Air\nHawaiian Airlines\nIsland AirAs a result of United Airlines and Continental Airlines merger, on March 3, 2012, OnePass program was phased out and merged into United MileagePlus program.

        "content": "The following were major accidents and incidents that have occurred on Continental Airlines mainline aircraft.\n\nAugust 27, 1945\nA Lockheed Lodestar burned out while parked at Albuquerque, New Mexico; there was no one on board.\nMarch 16, 1954\nFlight 46, on a flight from Midland, Texas, to Kansas City, Missouri, suffered vibration just after takeoff and went into a dive; the flight crew managed to make a wheels-up landing in an open field.\nMay 22, 1962\nThomas Doty, a passenger intent on having his wife claim money from life insurance, boarded Flight 11 with a bomb, which departed Chicago-O\u2019Hare, destined for Kansas City Municipal Airport. The bomb exploded, breaking off the aircraft's tail, and the plane crashed on a farm near Unionville, Missouri. All 45 on board died, including the suicide bomber. This aircraft had previously been subject to an attempted hijacking to Cuba, although the hijackers were captured in El Paso, Texas.\nJuly 8, 1962\nA Vickers Viscount was damaged beyond economic repair when the propellers struck the runway shortly after take-off. A wheels-up landing was made in a wheat field.\nJanuary 29, 1963\nFlight 290, en route from Midland, Texas, to Kansas City, crashed on approach near the south end of the runway and burst into flames.\nAugust 4, 1971\nContinental Airlines Flight 712, on a flight coming from Hilo International Airport into Los Angeles International Airport collided in midair over Compton with a Cessna 150 at about 3,950 feet during an evening approach to LAX. The Boeing suffered substantial damage to the outer right-wing panel but landed safely. The Cessna 150 crashed and was destroyed but both occupants survived with injuries.\nApril 13, 1973\nAfter bringing Bob and Audrey Six to their Colorado ranch, the Sabreliner crew departed Montrose Regional Airport, for the return flight to Los Angeles (LAX). The thrust reverser of the aircraft was deployed in flight shortly after takeoff. The aircraft descended from 1,000 feet (300 m), struck the ground, and was destroyed.\nAugust 7, 1975\nFlight 426, bound for Wichita, Kansas, crashed near the departure end of runway shortly after takeoff from Denver-Stapleton International Airport. The aircraft encountered severe windshear at an altitude and airspeed which precluded recovery to level flight. The aircraft descended at a rate which could not be overcome even though the aircraft was flown at or near its maximum lift capability throughout the encounter. The windshear was generated by the outflow from a thunderstorm which was over the aircraft's departure path. All passengers and crew were safely evacuated. The aircraft, a Boeing 727, was a total loss.\nMarch 1, 1978\nFlight 603 was scheduled to Honolulu, HI from Los Angeles. At takeoff, the McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 overran the runway at Los Angeles (LAX) when the takeoff was aborted as a result of a tire explosion. The resulting overrun caused a fire that engulfed the aircraft. The aircraft was a total loss; two passengers died when they evacuated the aircraft directly into the fire. Two other passengers died three months later of their injuries.\nJuly 8, 1987\nA Continental Boeing 747 had a near collision with an off-course Delta Air Lines Lockheed L-1011. Both the Delta (London-Cincinnati) and Continental (London-Newark) were heading to the U.S., with a total of nearly 600 people on board. The Delta flight strayed 60 miles (97 km) off course during its flight, and came within 30 feet (9.1 m) of colliding with the 747 as the L-1011 flew under it in Canadian airspace. It was potentially the deadliest aviation accident in history. Delta pilots attempted to convince the Continental crew to cover up the incident and not report it.\nNovember 15, 1987\nFlight 1713, bound for Boise, Idaho, crashed on take-off during a snowstorm at Stapleton International Airport, Denver, Colorado. 25 passengers and 3 crew were killed.\nMarch 2, 1994\nFlight 795, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82, suffered damage due to a rejected takeoff from runway 13 at LaGuardia Airport during wintry conditions. The aircraft failed to takeoff and came to a stop at the edge of a ditch near the runway. 30 Passengers and crew suffered minor injuries.\nFebruary 19, 1996\nFlight 1943 landed wheels up on runway 27 at the Houston Intercontinental Airport, Houston, Texas.\nSeptember 16, 1998\nFlight 475 from Houston to Guadalajara, a Boeing 737-500, was damaged beyond repair upon exiting the left side of the runway while landing. There were no injuries, and wind shear is suspected to have been a factor.\nJuly 25, 2000\nThe official investigation found that Flight 55 (a Continental DC-10) caused the crash of Air France Concorde Flight 4590 in Paris. The DC-10 dropped a strip of titanium alloy from its thrust reverser on the runway during takeoff. When AF4590 subsequently departed, Concorde's left main landing gear tires struck the strip of metal and were punctured. The tires then exploded and tire rubber fragments penetrated Concorde's wing fuel tanks, starting fires in engines 1 and 2, leading to the crash which killed all aboard and four people on the ground. According to the official report on the accident, the strip of metal installed on the Continental jet was made from a different alloy than had been approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration or the engine manufacturer. This led French authorities to undertake a criminal investigation into Continental Airlines, which ended in Continental being fined 200,000 euros and ordered to pay 1 million euros to Air France.\nJanuary 16, 2006\nA mechanic standing near a Boeing 737 at El Paso International Airport in Texas was sucked into one of the engines and killed. The mechanic's failure to maintain proper clearance with the engine intake during a jet engine run, and the failure of contract maintenance personnel to follow written procedures and directives contained in the airline's general maintenance manual were determined to be the cause. Factors contributing to the accident were the insufficient training provided to the contract mechanics by the airline, and the failure of the airport to disseminate a policy prohibiting ground engine runs above idle power in the terminal area.\nDecember 20, 2008\nFlight 1404 bound for Houston, pulled left and ran off of the runway during its takeoff roll at Denver International Airport. The cause of the incident is unknown, however the right side of aircraft caught fire once coming to a stop. Of the 115 people on board, 47 sustained injuries, with 2 seriously injured, including the pilot."

        "content": "The area was originally called \"Socconessing\" by the first inhabitants, the Esopus Munsee of the Lenni Lenape. Socconessing means  \"a muddy place where the water comes out\", referencing the Sandburg Creek. The Esopus lived in this area for thousands of years before being pushed out by the early pioneers.\nThe first building erected in what is now the center of the village was built around 1798 by Alpheus Fairchild, who moved west from Connecticut. However, in what is now the easternmost part of the village, the Bodley homestead most likely stood well before the Revolution, as did portions of the Bevier and Sax farms. It was named \"Fairchild City\" or just \"The City\" after Alpheus Fairchild, who bought most of today's village in 1798 from John A. DeWitt; Fairchild had a dwelling erected on part of the site where the George and John R. Hunt Memorial Building stands today. Nathan and Maria Hoornbeek bought the dwelling and enlarged it, converting it into an inn. The Hoornbeek Tavern was a gathering place for the citizens, and many important decisions about the community were made at meetings held there. Indeed, the decision to change the name of the community to \"Ellenville\" was proposed at the Hoornbeek Tavern. Village leaders, unable to agree upon a new name, were persuaded by Ellen Snyder, Maria Hoornbeek's sister, to name the village after her.\nCharles Hartshorn came to \"The City\" to try a case in the Hoornbeek Tavern in 1823. He opened the first store that same year, and led a drive to choose a \"real\" name for the community.  Hartshorn also applied to the federal government for approval of a post office and was named the first postmaster. He later erected a home for his family on the former site of the Hoornbeek Tavern. In 1856, he was elected first president of the newly incorporated village of Ellenville.\nNoted American composer Homer Newton Bartlett resided at 32 Maple Avenue in Ellenville for many years during the late 19th century.\nJust north of the village, the Joseph Y. Resnick Airport (N89) is named in honor and memory of U.S. Congressman Joseph Yale Resnick, a Wawarsing native. Ellenville Regional Hospital, just north of the airport, and the Nevele Tower, just south of the village, were both dedicated by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson, at Congressman Resnick's request.\nEllenville was the fourth community featured on ABC's television show, My Kind of Town, recorded in New York City on August 6, 2005, and broadcast on September 4, 2005.\nThe village's Christ Lutheran Church and Parsonage, Ellenville Downtown Historic District, George and John R. Hunt Memorial Building, and United States Post Office are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.Ellenville has three copies of the statue known as The Boy with the Leaking Boot.\nDue to good launch sites and favorable weather conditions, Ellenville became a major center for the development of hang gliding in the 1970s and 1980s. The area is now home to three major hang-gliding schools and is considered one of the best sites for instruction east of the Mississippi. On most weekends, hang gliders can be seen launching off of two sites on the Shawangunk Ridge just south of Nevele and Honors Haven."

        "content": "One of the first roads in America, the Old Mine Road, which followed earlier Indian trails, led to sporadic Dutch and later settlements along its 104-mile (167 km) length from New Jersey to Kingston, including Ellenville, but with no navigable rivers, the construction of the Delaware & Hudson Canal in the 1820s led to the first major boom in development of Ellenville as a canal town and manufacturing center. The D&H Canal was eventually superseded at the close of the 19th century by the New York, Ontario and Western Railway, more commonly known as the O&W or NYO&W, which opened up a significant tourism and hospitality industry, including dozens of hotels, inns, boarding houses, and bungalow colonies. The eventual modernization of the Old Mine Road into US 209 continued to bring vacationers to the area, even after passenger railroad service was discontinued in the 1940s. Relatively inexpensive and increased air travel beginning in the 1960s, a generational change in tastes, and, most recently, the economic downturn's impact on tourism in general, though, have taken their toll. The Nevele Hotel, perhaps the most famous local resort, was closed in 2009. Its sister resort hotel, the Fallsview, has recently been purchased and renamed Honor's Haven, and has undergone major renovations and introduced health-related programs in an attempt to attract new customers.The canal and westward expansion led to various industrial opportunities. Reportedly, very pioneer wagon heading west carried a Napanoch axe and an Ellenville demijohn. Ellenville pottery and glassworks still remain sought-after collector items; many examples are on display at the Ellenville Public Library's Terwilliger House Museum. Knife manufacturing was a major industry in Ellenville and Napanoch for over 100 years; the Ulster Knife Company set up in the 1870s, eventually merging with Imperial Knife Company and Schrade Cutlery, finally becoming Imperial Schrade until its closing in 2004.\nIn the early 20th century, the rediscovery of the lost Old Spanish Tunnel at the base of the Shawangunk Ridge in Ellenville led to the development of the Sun-Ray Spring and the international marketing by White Rock beverage entrepreneur Frank T. Huntoon of Sun-Ray Water, tested and promoted as the \"World's Purest Spring Water\". Although beset by financial difficulties from its inception, the water and its carbonated derivatives were sold until the early 1920s, and redeveloped as \"Pure Rock Mineral Water\" in 1939, also serving as a base for Pepsi-Cola bottled in Ellenville during World War II.\nIn the late 1940s, Joseph Resnick, a radio officer in the U.S. Merchant Marine during the war, developed a turnable DIY antenna system just as the TV boom was taking off. With his brothers Harry and Louis, he created Channel Master, and built one of the region's major manufacturing plants just north of the Ellenville border, along with an aluminum plant to fabricate necessary components. After selling the company to Avnet, production moved to South Carolina. The vacated Channel Master factory was eventually bought by Imperial Schrade, and the aluminum plant by VAW, and later Hydro Aluminum; both factories closed in the 2000s, leaving hundreds unemployed, compounding Ellenville's economic doldrums that began with a decline of the tourism and hotel industry in the 1960s, and the development of regional shopping malls, which directed much shopping traffic away from the village."

The tunnel is part of the Bergen Line between the cities of Oslo and Bergen. It is the longest tunnel on the line, and the third longest railway tunnel in the kingdom. Inside the tunnel, at 1,237 metres (4,058 ft) elevation, is the highest point on the Norwegian railway network.The tunnel was constructed to increase the regularity of the line past the Finse peak which was often blocked by snow. Planning started during the 1980s to remove this section that was regularly snowed down, and at the same time reduce the length and increase the speed of the railway. Construction started in 1990, and it was opened by King Harald V on 16 May 1993. Following the construction of the tunnel, 32 kilometres (20 mi) of railway around this area was also rebuilt to achieve higher train speeds, a shorter overall distance, and to maximize the natural protection from the weather.  This was built in five stages, opening between 1995 and 1998."

The Finse Tunnel, unlike most other tunnels on the line, does have some safety equipment such as communications systems, lighting, and emergency areas, but the report was critical of the ability to evacuate the tunnel. There is only 1 metre (3.3 ft) of clearance on each side of the trains, and it would take between two and three hours to get fire fighters to the scene, since the tunnel is located in an area without roads. However, the probability of a fire occurring in the tunnel was considered very small.\n\n\n== References =="

The uprising was put down by Colonel H\u00e9ctor Benigno Varela's 10th Cavalry Regiment of the Argentine Army under the orders of President Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen. Approximately 300-1,500 rural workers were shot and killed by the 10th Cavalry Regiment in the course of the operations, many of them executed by firing squads after surrendering. Most of the executed were Spanish and Chilean workers who had sought refuge in Argentina's Patagonia after their strike in the city of Puerto Natales in southern Chile in 1919 was crushed by the Chilean authorities, at the cost of four carabiniers killed and the offices of their union were burned by the civilians, policemen and the militaries in Punta Arenas on July 27, 1920. At least two Argentine soldiers (privates Fernando Pablo Fischer and Domingo Montenegro), three local policemen (sergeant Tom\u00e1s Rosa and constables Ernesto Boz\u00e1n and Juan Campos) and a number of ranch owners and their relatives also died during the strife. According to the versions well publicized by the army and the landowners, several of the captured women were raped in the uprising as the rebel forces fought for control of the territory. These versions have been widely discredited. The most detailed narrative of these events is that by Osvaldo Bayer (1972, below), summarized in English by Bruce Chatwin in 1976."

        "content": "The Federaci\u00f3n Obrera de Magallanes was born in the early 1910 in Punta Arenas, capital of the Chilean Territory of Colonization of Magallanes and economic metropolis of southern Patagonia. The multinational union extended throughout the region and led the formation of the Sociedad Obrera de R\u00edo Gallegos (Workers' Society of Rio Gallegos) in the argentinean National Territory of santa Cruz, directed by the Spanish anarchist Antonio Soto, known as the Gallego Soto. Santa Cruz was a center of wool production for export, with large estates and English meat processing plants. The low demand of wool inventories, which had been accumulated at the end of the First World War, and the fall of the price from $9.74 to $3.08, thus returning to the normal level of quotation in times of peace, gave rise to a regional crisis. This affected landowners and merchants, but had an even greater impact on wool workers and rural laborers, who were living in miserable conditions. With the end of the war, the price of exports of Patagonian raw materials fell. The normal working day of the workers of that time was 12 hours, that of the shearers and muleteers was around 16 hours; wages were minimal and were often paid in bonds or in foreign currency which when exchanged in the stores was taken for a lower value. In addition, the only day off was Sunday.\nA protest strike in September 1920 against the arbitrary actions of the police, the boycott of three merchants linked to the Sociedad Rural and the arrest of the leaders of the Sociedad Obrera deepened the confrontation. Delegates from all over the province came to discuss the measures to be demanded of the Rural Society. In this situation, the workers gathered in the Sociedad Obrera de R\u00edo Gallegos presented the management with a list of demands for an improvement in working conditions. \nAmong other demands, the workers requested that no more than three men should sleep in 16 square meters, that a package of candles should be given to each worker every month, that no work should be done on Saturdays, an improvement in the food portions, a minimum monthly salary of 100 pesos, and recognition of the Sociedad Obrera as the only legitimate representative of the workers, accepting the appointment of a delegate as an intermediary between the parties in conflict. This document was rejected by the organization that grouped the landowners and the Sociedad Obrera. The response of the workers was to declare a general strike throughout Santa Cruz."

        "content": "In 1920, in the aftermath of the First World War, the price of wool had dropped significantly provoking an economic crisis in sheep-breeding Argentine Patagonia. The strike occurred during a period in which Argentina had been facing a worker's shortage and an economic downturn, which led to rising prices, which had only began to slowly return to higher economic recovery. The fear of revolution and unrest may have threatened to destroy Argentine society, as the Russian Revolution acted as moral boost for the workers and was fear-inducing in the middle and upper classes of Argentina. During the 8 years preceding the Patagonia Rebelde, the Argentine economy and government was making efforts to move away from a mostly agricultural mode of production and attempted to diversify and industrialize, following a trend among nations of the period. The period of economic recovery which preceded the Patagonia Rebelde and followed the economic downturn of 1914 was expected to be less radical and more stable than the period before during the economic downturn. However, it was marked by a number of strikes which resulted in violent confrontations, with Patagonia Rebelde following this trend  The Patagonia Rebelde mirrors some aspects of the \"Semana Tragica (Tragic Week)\", in that it was a failed attempt at using a mass movement in order to affect working conditions with a strike, with its roots in revolutionary and anarchist ideas. The period preceding the Patagonia Rebelde was also marked by the strengthening of the feminist movement within Argentina, which saw changes to the workforce and brought Argentine women in contact with a more radical ideology. In August 1920 there were a number of strikes in the province of Santa Cruz, followed by a general strike declared on 1 November. Most of the strikers were shearers and rural workers. The first armed confrontation took place on 2 January 1921 near El Cerrito, where four policemen and a striker were killed, and two policemen and a gendarme were taken hostages. Another gendarme was shot and killed in an ambush at Centinela river several days later. The ranchers and the interim governor Edelmiro Correa Falc\u00f3n, himself a landowner, used the incidents to ask the federal government to declare a state of emergency in Santa Cruz. As the unrest spread, the government of Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen ordered Colonel H\u00e9ctor Benigno Varela's 10th Cavalry Regiment immediately to the affected area and the Argentine Navy seized the various ports and key facilities in the province. The new police chief in Santa Cruz, Oscar Schweizer, under orders of the new governor of the province, radical \u00c1ngel Ignacio Yza, instructed Varela to avoid bloodshed and the army colonel was able to work out a deal with the strikers and the ranch owners, and prohibited the payment of wages in Chilean money. In May 1921 the cavalry regiment returned to Buenos Aires but their leave was cancelled in October as strikes broke out again in the province when the ranch owners reneged on their promise of fairer working conditions. The leader of the strikers was a Galician anarchist, Antonio Soto, general secretary of the Workers' Society of Rio Gallegos, the local branch of the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation. \nManuel Carl\u00e9s, president of the Argentine Patriotic League is reported to have violently broken up one of the demonstration of the strikers in R\u00edo Gallegos with one dead and four injured in the resulting clash. The month of August saw activity in the ports of Deseado, Santa Cruz, San Juli\u00e1n and R\u00edo Gallegos came to a complete standstill with a general strike. Hundreds of strikers believed to be anarchists or Bolsheviks were either thrown in jails or shipped back to Buenos Aires. The Buenos Aires press referred to the armed strikers as \"anarchists\" and \"thieves\". At the same time, the Chilean government grew alarmed at the prospect of facing similar unrest in southern Chile and deployed a strong carabineer force under colonel Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo to the city of Puerto Natales. According to historian Miguel Angel Scenna, the Argentine government soon grew suspicious of the deployment of this Chilean force on the Chilean-Argentine border. According to captain Elbio Carlos Anaya, a company commander in the 10th Cavalry Regiment, the Chilean carabineers guarding the mountain passes, let the strikers cross back and forth into Argentina armed with weapons and without any hindrance on the part of the authorities. On 16 November 1921, however, the Chilean government eventually took sides and allowed colonel Varela and a motorized column of 13 soldiers to take a 50 km shortcut from Rio Turbio to Cancha Carrera through Chilean territory, east of Puerto Natales, along today's Highway 9."

His company commanders in the second expedition were captains Pedro Vi\u00f1as Ibarra and Pedro E. Camposare. A detachment of National Gendarmerie troops was also added to the cavalry force. This unit sailed for Santa Cruz on 4 November 1921. In the meantime, as a group of ten strikers approached the Estancia Bremen, the German ranch owner and his parents sensing danger, sought to defend their property with carbines and two strikers were killed and four were wounded in the exchange of fire. In response the strikers took several ranch owners and their families hostage and reportedly killed and raped some. Upon disembarking at Santa Cruz port the 10th Cavalry Regiment soon made its presence felt with arbitrary arrests and executions. After a clash in Punta Alta the 10th Cavalry Regiment liberated 14 hostages. But the soldiers were also reported to have killed some 100 unarmed workers suspected of collaborating with the strikers, among them Santiago Gonz\u00e1lez, a stonemason at the local Argentina National Bank (Banco de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina) branch. Gonz\u00e1lez, an anarchist, was forced to dig his own grave before being shot.

In December one of the ranch owners, Daniel Ram\u00edrez, was himself taken into detention under the orders of captain Anaya for assisting and actively cooperating with the armed strikers. Ram\u00edrez was executed in the first week of February 1922 after having been brutally tortured for over a week. His wife and several local merchants intervened and pleaded for his life, but this was to no avail. At Paso Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez a large column of some 900 demoralized armed strikers tried to negotiate a favorable surrender with Colonel Varela but were soon rebuffed and retreated to regroup at R\u00edo Chico and Estancia Bella Vista after freeing those they had taken captive as hostages. In the meantime the local police forces hunted down and arrested or executed those sympathetic to the armed uprising. The cavalry regiment captured some 480 strikers in the interior at Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Le\u00f3n along with 4,000 horses and 298 rifles and carbines and 49 revolvers. More than half of those captured at Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Le\u00f3n were executed before the firing squads stopped. The regiment then stormed La Anita and Men\u00e9ndez Behety estancias and some 80 ranch owners and their families as well as captured policemen and other civilians were released in the operation, with around 500 captured strikers being executed. The armed strikers, knowing there would be no mercy, made a desperate last stand at Tehuelches train station but were defeated after a one-hour long battle and the survivors marched off to firing squads. At Estaci\u00f3n Tehuelches (today's Pico Truncado) the army lost the only soldier killed in action during the campaign, Private Fernando Pablo Fischer. The other soldier to die in the operations was another conscript, 19-year-old Domingo Montenegro from the Clase 900 (1900 intake of conscripts), shot and killed in error in the darkness by Private Eusebio Peralta while Montengro returned to his vivac from sentry duties, according to historian Osvaldo Bayer who referred to the conscripts disparagingly as \"poor rifle slavemen\".The 10th Cavalry Regiment having accomplished its mission of putting the uprising soon received orders to return to Buenos Aires, but some 200 soldiers were left behind under the commands of captains Anaya and Vi\u00f1as Ibarra. Contrary to Argentine popular myth, Varela received a frosty reception in Buenos Aires where the Minister of War gave him a complete dressing down. Varela also came under heavy criticism by the Socialist parliamentarian Antonio Di Tomaso."

        "content": "News of the mass execution soon reached Buenos Aires but the government made no call into an official investigation for fear of political repercussions. Argentine socialists and anarchists however promised vengeance. Kurt Gustav Wilckens, a 35-year-old German immigrant from Silesia, had been deported from the United States for his radical political views. In Argentina, he worked as a stevedore at Ingeniero White and Bah\u00eda Blanca, as a farm worker in Alto Valle del R\u00edo Negro and as a correspondent for the anarchist newspapers Alarm of Hamburg and The Syndicalist of Berlin. Although he claimed to be an adherent of Tolstoy's pacifism, Wilckens killed Varela in a gun and bomb attack outside the officer's recently acquired home at Humboldt-Santa Fe in January 1923 because of his desire \"to wound through him the brazen idol of a criminal system\". Upon hearing of the assassination, Argentine President Yrigoyen arranged that the house the colonel had been paying off be given to the widow of Varela as a gift, even though the couple had only recently committed to purchasing. Wilckens himself was killed in Villa Devoto prison while awaiting sentencing, by Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Mill\u00e1n Temperley, a young man from an aristocratic family belonging to the Patriotic League. P\u00e9rez Mill\u00e1n had served in Patagonia. He was the gendarme taken hostage by the strikers after the gunbattle at El Cerrito, in 1921, and was also a distant relative of Varela.  News of Wilckens's death led to a general dock strike and the burning of streetcars, as well as arrests, injuries and deaths but achieved according to historian Otto Vargas \"an incredible miracle in unifying the divided working class in Argentina\". P\u00e9rez Mill\u00e1n was found guilty of manslaughter and condemned to eight years in prison. He was however declared insane 14 months later and admitted to Las Mercedes mental hospital in Buenos Aires, where he was eventually shot and killed by another inmate instigated by Russian anarchist Boris Wladimirovich.In June 1921, Argentine parliamentarians debated a proposed law giving the state the power to control unions, declare strikes illegal, and reimpose the ten-hour workday. This debate provoked popular condemnation in a demonstration supported on all sides, followed by a general strike and a declaration of state of emergency along the country.\nThe repression of the 1920-1922 strikes culminated both the Patagonian labor movement and the initial colonization of southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, and inaugurated the effective erection of border patrols by the Argentinean and the Chilean militaries."

The group is based around a wiki, which enables people to register their own tree planting events, to find like-minded friends in their region, and to network with foresters and other tree experts. As of 2016, events have taken place in Berlin, Brandenburg, G\u00f6ttingen, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany as well as in H\u00eerbov\u0103\u021b in Moldova. It is hoped that the idea will spread, with further volunteers getting involved in organising tree planting events using the WikiWoods software as a coordinating platform.\nWikiWoods plants according to a set of sustainability guidelines that were specially developed for the group. The events that have been carried out so far include afforestation, the conversion of monoculture coniferous forests into mixed woodland, the planting of hedges and forest edges, as well as the planting, harvesting, and pruning of fruit trees.\nIn order to ensure the future protection of the trees that are planted, WikiWoods works with environmental partners who provide the land and take responsibility for their ongoing care. Partner organizations include WWF, BUND, NABU National Heritage Foundation (NABU-Stiftung Nationales Naturerbe), and the Lower Oder Valley National Park.\nWikiWoods is supported by sponsor organization Active Commons e.V., which provides funds for planting projects and the operation of the Internet platform.

Hayracks are permanent structures, primarily made of wood, upon which fodder for animals is dried, although their use is not limited to drying hay. Other food stuffs such as field maize are dried on them as well. Although it is a practical structure, a hayrack is often artistically designed and handcrafted and is regarded by Slovenes as a distinctive form of vernacular architecture that marks Slovene identity."

The word stog also refers to a haystack and is derived from Common Slavic stog\u044a 'stack, heap'. The word toplar (or doplar) is borrowed from Austrian German Doppler, referring to a double structure in general.Specific varieties of hayrack include:\n\nSingle straight-line hayrack (enojni stegnjeni kozolec)\nSingle straight-line hayrack with catslide roof (stegnjeni kozolec s pla\u0161\u010dem)\nDouble straight-line hayrack (dvojni stegnjeni kozolec)\nRoofed double hayrack (dvojni vezani kozolec)\nRoofed double hayrack with one strut (dvojni vezani kozolec v eno drevo)\nRoofed double hayrack with two struts (dvojni vezani kozolec v dve drevesi, toplar)\nRoofed double hayrack with extension (toplar z repom)\nRoofed double hayrack with shed (kozolec s hi\u0161o)\nSplit-level double hayrack (kozolec na kozla, kozolec na psa)"

An early mention of Jan Amora was when Baeda Maryam I, who was campaigning against the now extinct Dobe'a in modern Afar region, had called upon them after his regular troops were defeated, with them being eager to participate in the campaign. The place name Jan Amora appears in the Futuh al-Habasha and in an 18th-century legal text, but it is unclear if they refer to the place that became this woreda; Richard Pankhurst believes that this \"Jan Amora\" was located south of Tekezze river. The military formation known as \"Jan Amora\" was later under the command of Emperor Lebna Dengel's uncle Azaj Fanoel.\nThe Jan Amora region today covers the Semien Mountains and a portion of their southern slopes, which makes access to this woreda difficult. A road linking Jan Amora and Debarq, 60 kilometers in length, was under construction in May 1994. Due to its inaccessibility and the lack of the most basic infrastructure, in 1999 the Regional government classified Addi Arkay as one of its 47 drought-prone and food-insecure woredas. To alleviate this situation, the Amhara Credit and Saving Institution SC, a micro-finance institution, opened an office in the woreda in the late 1990s. The Semien Mountains cover most of the northern part of this woreda, as well as the Semien Mountains National Park."

Located Jan Amora and Debarq Semien (North) Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region, its territory covers the Simien Mountains and includes Ras Dashan, the highest point in Ethiopia. It is home to a number of endangered species, including the Ethiopian wolf and the walia ibex, a wild goat found nowhere else in the world. The gelada baboon and the caracal, a cat, also occur within the Simien Mountains\nAlthough the word Semien means \"north\" in Amharic, according to Richard Pankhurst the ancestral form of the word actually meant \"south\" in Ge'ez, because the mountains lay to the south of Aksum, which was at the time the center of Ethiopian civilization. But as over the following centuries the center of Ethiopian civilization itself moved to the south, these mountains came to be thought of as lying to the north, and the meaning of the word likewise changed.\nThe Semiens are remarkable as being one of the few spots in Africa where snow regularly falls. First mentioned in the Monumentum Adulitanum of the 4th century AD (which described them as \"inaccessible mountains covered with snow\" and where soldiers walked up to their knees in snow), the presence of snow was undeniably witnessed by the 17th century Jesuit priest Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo. Although the later traveler James Bruce claims that he had never witnessed snow in the Semien Mountains, the 19th century explorer Henry Salt not only recorded that he saw snow there (on 9 April 1814), but explained the reason for Bruce's failure to see snow in these mountains \u2013 Bruce had ventured no further than the foothills into the Semiens.\nThe Walia ibex is another animal that is native to Jan Amora. The ibex is from the goat family, and currently there are 1200 in Jan Amora. This endangered species is found in only semien Mountains Debark and Jan Amora. Jan Amora also is home to two of some of the most endangered animals the Simien jackal and the Ethiopian wolf. The population  of these recently animals is increasing to about 10% every year\n Jan Amora is also the place for Ethiopian monkey Gelada with large populations in the Semien Mountains. The Gelada live with other large group Monkeys. These Gelada only found in Ethiopia not other else. These Gelada mainly eat grass but the Male gelada eat other animals' meat. When both blades and seeds are available, geladas prefer the seeds. They also eat flowers, rhizomes and roots when available. At night, they sleep on the ledges of cliffs. At sunrise, they leave the cliffs and travel to the tops of the plateaus to feed and socialize. When morning ends, social activities tend to wane and the geladas primarily focus on foraging. They will travel during this time, as well. When evening arrives, geladas exhibit more social activities before descending to the cliffs to sleep.Over 474,000 tourists visited Semien Mountains during the first nine months of the current Ethiopian fiscal year, from  Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy and among others country. Ethiopia generates $252 million revenue from tourism in Semien Mountains in 2006 to 2011."

The company's initial funds came from the village of Newburgh and area residents, who allocated $126,000 to the new company. These funds were used to construct the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike in 1810. The construction of the toll road caused the area surrounding the highway to quickly grow in size. At its west end, the influx of workers led to the creation of Sullivan County in 1809. To the east, the traffic generated by this and other turnpikes sparked a similar period of growth and prosperity in the village of Newburgh. The village became a city in 1865.The turnpike served as the area's main transport route until 1871, when it was replaced in purpose by the Middletown and Crawford Railroad. Ownership and maintenance of the highway was turned over to the towns it passed through in 1872, effectively dissolving the toll road. In the early 20th century, the state of New York took over maintenance of the old turnpike from Fosterdale to Newburgh, repurposing the highway as a toll-free state road. Two sections of the highway became part of state routes when the modern New York state route system was established in 1924, and the entire Fosterdale\u2013Newburgh highway was assigned a number as part of the 1930 state highway renumbering. The piece from Monticello to Bloomingburg was bypassed by the Quickway in the mid-to-late 1950s; however, the rest of the Fosterdale\u2013Newburgh segment is still state-maintained as parts of NY 17B and NY 17K."

Given the geologically favorable conditions, not only in relation to the livestock, but above all to agriculture, there was a rapid development of the stronghold attracting new residents to the region with the flux of residents a chapel was erected under the invocation of Senhora Santana, in the same place of the current Matriz. From this pioneering convergence, the village and the adjacent settlements would be born forming a rapid flowering stage.\nThe elevation of the camp to the category of village took place according to Provincial Law n\u00ba 2096, of November 26, 1885.

It has since been involved in the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest, campaigns to improve working conditions and immigrant worker empowerment in various Korean ethnic industries, the living wages campaign, and Koreatown's multi-ethnic community developments.\nKIWA is perhaps best known recently for its long campaign against Assi Market, the largest ethnic Korean-owned supermarket of the United States, located in Koreatown. Started in the late 1990s, KIWA demands that Assi management rehire dozens of fired Latino and Korean workers who were fired for trying to organize a trade union.\nAlthough initially staffed mostly by ethnic Koreans, KIWA grew to encompass Asian-Pacific American and Latino organizers and members. The Spanish language \"Alianza de trabajadores inmigrantes del Barrio Coreano\" had been in common use since the early 2000s; however the English language name was officially changed in March 2006 from Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates to Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance. The Korean language \"\ud55c\uc778\ub178\ub3d9\uc0c1\ub2f4\uc18c\" (Korean Worker's Center) has been changed to \ud55c\uc778\ud0c0\uc6b4 \ub178\ub3d9\uc5f0\ub300 to signify its geographical focus rather than on an ethnic group.\nKIWA is a member organization of MIWON (Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers Alliance [1]), an alliance of four (formerly five) immigrant worker centers in the Los Angeles area, and ENLACE, a U.S.-Mexico network of worker centers."

According to Notovitch, the work had been preserved in the Hemis library and was shown to him by the monks there while he was recuperating from a broken leg. However, once his story had been re-examined by historians, it is claimed that Notovitch confessed to having fabricated the evidence. Bible scholar Bart D. Ehrman states that \"Today there is not a single recognized scholar on the planet who has any doubts about the matter. The entire story was invented by Notovitch, who earned a good deal of money and a substantial amount of notoriety for his hoax\".The Indian Pandit Swami Abhedananda also claims to have read the same manuscript and published his account of viewing it after his visit to Hemis in 1921. Abhedananda claims on the book jacket that it was translated for him with the help of a \"local Lama interpreter.\" After Abhedananda's death, one of his disciples admitted that when he went to the monastery to ask about the documents, he was told that they had disappeared. (In the same vein, Notovich did not initially translate the manuscript but said that his Sherpa guide did, as he could not read the original text.) Notovich's version of the manuscript was translated from Tibetan to Russian to French to English. According to Swami Abhedananda's account, his Lama's translation was equivalent to the one published by Notovich. The Gutenberg Project has published Notovich's manuscript as a free ebook."

He is believed to have been born on the 10th day of the fifth month (non or jyestha) of the Monkey year of the Tibetan calendar, as predicted by the Buddha Shakyamuni. It is also believed that his life mission was, and remains, to improve the spiritual condition of all living beings. Therefore, on this day, which comes once in a cycle of 12 years, Hemis observes a major extravaganza in his memory. The observance of these sacred rituals is believed to provide spiritual strength and good health. The Hemis festival takes place in the rectangular courtyard in front of the main door of the monastery. The space is wide and open, save for two raised square platforms, three feet high with a sacred pole in the center. A raised dais with a richly cushioned seat, a finely painted small Tibetan table, and ceremonial items \u2013 cups full of holy water, uncooked rice, and tormas made of dough and butter, along with incense sticks \u2013 are placed. A number of musicians play traditional music with four pairs of cymbals, large-pan drums, small trumpets, and large-sized wind instruments. Next to them, a small space is assigned for the lamas to sit.\nThe ceremonies begin with an early morning ritual atop the gompa where, to the beat of drums, the resounding clash of cymbals, and the spiritual wail of pipes, the portrait of \"Dadmokarpo\" or \"Rygyalsras Rinpoche\" is ceremoniously put on display for all to admire and worship.\nThe most esoteric festivities include the mystic mask dances. The mask dances of Ladakh are collectively referred to as chams performances. Chams performances are essentially part of the Tantric tradition, performed only in those gompas that follow the Tantric Vajrayana teachings, and the monks perform tantric worship."

In November of that year the Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Sierra Leone the Rt Revd Ernest Graham Ingham visited Puerto de la Cruz and formed a committee to implement the church building project.The church was built with money donated by foreign visitors and British residents in the city. The organ, the pulpit, stained glass windows, baptismal font and other items were private donations. The clergy house and the stained glass windows were gifts from Mary Boreham and other family members. She was the widow of Walter Long Boreham who had died in 1890. The church is built in Gothic Revival style.\nAll Saints' of Puerto de la Cruz was the first Anglican church built in the Canary Islands.

        "content": "An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 is an example of a regular appropriations bill.\nAppropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. The U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 7) states that \"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...\" This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills.The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 falls under the jurisdiction of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. The bill covers appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, as well as for a variety of agencies with a scientific emphasis. The House and Senate currently consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall.In 2013, Congress was unable to pass all twelve appropriations bills (for fiscal year 2014) before October 1, 2013 when the new fiscal year. This led to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. The shutdown lasted for 16 days. Finally, late in the evening of October 16, Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, and the President signed it shortly after midnight on October 17, ending the government shutdown and suspending the debt limit until February 7, 2014. In reaction to this situation, House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers has stated that his goal is to pass all twelve regular appropriations bills for 2015 before Congress has a recess in August because he wants to avoid a similar situation. This bill is the earliest to be considered since 1974, according to the Chairman. The appropriations process for fiscal year 2015 was widely \"viewed as Congress' best chance in years to pass and conference spending bills ahead of the October 1 start of the fiscal year.\""

The city was incorporated in 1903 and is the self-professed \"Home of the Manatee\". Crystal River Preserve State Park is located nearby, and Crystal River Archaeological State Park is located in the city's northwest side.\nCrystal River is at the heart of the Nature Coast of Florida. The city is situated around Kings Bay, which is spring-fed so it keeps a constant 72 \u00b0F (22 \u00b0C) temperature year round. A cluster of 50 springs designated as a first-magnitude system feeds Kings Bay. A first-magnitude system discharges 100 cubic feet or more of water per second, which equals about 64 million gallons of water per day. Because of this discharge amount, the Crystal River Springs group is the second largest springs group in Florida, the first being Wakulla Springs in Wakulla County near Tallahassee. Kings Bay can be home to over 400 manatees during the winter when the water temperature in the Gulf of Mexico cools, and is the only place in the United States where people can legally interact with them in their natural conditions without that interaction being viewed as harassment by law enforcement agencies. Tourism based on watching and swimming with manatees is the fastest growing contribution to the local economy. In 2005, there was a movement to dissolve the city which did not succeed, and the city has since grown by annexation."

        "content": "In the Pleistocene era, the land on which Crystal River is located was vastly different from today. The west coast of Florida is thought to have extended an additional 50 to 60 miles (80 to 97 km) into the Gulf of Mexico. During excavations for the Crystal River Nuclear Plant in 1969, scientists discovered rhinoceros and mastodon bones, as well as the shells of an extremely large armadillo and a large land tortoise.Around 500 BCE mound-building Native Americans (possibly Deptford culture) built a settlement along the Crystal River, which in the present day is the Crystal River Archaeological State Park. It was abandoned prior to European colonization for unknown reasons. The Native American name for Crystal River was Weewahi Iaca.Following the Second Seminole War, settlers were encouraged into the area due to the passing of the Armed Occupation Act of 1842 by the United States federal government. Twenty-two men filed for patents for land in Crystal River. By the mid-1800s, families began to settle in the Crystal River area.\nMail was delivered by horse and buggy, and a stagecoach came from Ocala (Fort King) to Crystal River, stopping at the Stage Stand, which today is the Stage Stand Cemetery in Homosassa.While no land battles were fought in the Crystal River area during the Civil War, there were many instances of skirmishes on the water directly off the coast of the Crystal and Homosassa rivers, as well as near Hickory Island in Yankeetown. By the time of the Civil War, Florida was an important source and supplier of food and other goods such as beef, pork, fish, corn, sugar, cotton, naval stores and salt. The Union was aware of this, and soon after the war began, the Union Navy blockaded the entire coast of Florida.Following the Civil War, Crystal River grew. People from states to the north began to arrive, attracted by the area's mild climate and the potential of becoming wealthy growing citrus fruits. Early settlers to the area had found wild citrus trees growing in abundance, thanks in part to the Spanish explorers who had brought oranges with them on their ships and had discarded the seeds in the new world. This gave rise to the planting of citrus groves. The \"Big Freeze\" of 1894\u20131895 destroyed most of the citrus groves in the county.A very early industry in the area was the turpentine business. Many of the barges during the Civil War blockade had been carrying turpentine, likely from the turpentine still of William Turner, who resided in Red Level. Other early industry in the Crystal River area included cedar mills. In 1882, James Williams moved his cedar mill to Crystal River, and began operating on King's Bay. The mill produced pencil boards, which were then shipped to Jersey City, New Jersey, by ship, and later on by train. The Dixon Cedar Mill was one of the largest industries in Crystal River, providing employment to many in the area, including women and African Americans.Crystal River had been part of Hernando County since its inception in 1843. In 1844, the county name changed from \"Hernando\" to \"Benton\", in honor of Senator Thomas Hart Benton who had sponsored the Armed Occupation Act of 1842, which had brought settlers to the area. The county name returned to Hernando in 1850.\nBy the late 1800s, the area along the west side of the county was growing rapidly, and the citizens of the area began to see a need for a new county with a county seat that was easier to reach. In 1887, Hernando County was divided into three parts: Pasco County, Hernando County, and Citrus County. The town of Mannfield was named the temporary county seat for two years. Mannfield was chosen as it was in the geographic center of the new county and was more accessible to citizens. The site for the eventual county seat, Inverness, was decided by a vote in 1891.Phosphate was discovered in 1889 in the east side of Citrus County, and the phosphate industry grew rapidly. Historians have claimed it to be \"one of the richest phosphate deposits in the world.\" The phosphate industry would boom in Crystal River and Citrus County until 1914, when it could no longer be shipped due to World War I.\nIn 1888, the railroad reached Crystal River. The arrival of the railroad proved to be a boon; it provided an easier way to ship and receive goods. It was also an easier way for tourists to travel in and out of the city. Sport fishing became a draw for many wealthy northerners. In the early 1990s, Arctic Air of America Inc. moved to Crystal River.Crystal River became a town in 1903. It was officially incorporated as a city on July 3, 1923.Crystal River Mall opened north of the center of town in 1990, which is now closed down."

These investigations identified about 65 square kilometres (25 sq mi) of Cockatoo Sands and about 24 square kilometres (9.3 sq mi) of Pago Sands on Carlton Hill Station suitable for fodder or perennial crops. The Cockatoo Sands have great potential because they are well-drained and have capacity to support agriculture throughout the wet season. As part of the Water for Food government program, the Department of Agriculture also investigated an additional 300 square kilometres (120 sq mi) of Cockatoo soils north of Kununurra for possible expansion.\nIn 2009, the Rudd Government and Colin Barnett announced a development plan for the area.

While the name Faros is strikingly similar to the name of the Greek island the settlers arrived from, there is an alternate theory that it came from the previous inhabitants of the area. A great naval battle was recorded a year after the establishment of Pharos colony by a Greek inscription in Pharos (384 \u2013 383 BC) and by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (80 \u2013 29 BC), initiated by conflicts between the Greek colonists and the indigenous Hvar islanders, the Liburnians, who asked their compatriots for support. 10,000 Liburnians sailed out from their capital Idassa (Zadar), led by the Iadasinoi (people of Zadar), and laid siege to Pharos. The Syracusan fleet positioned in Issa was informed in time, and Greek triremes attacked the siege fleet, taking victory in the end. According to Diodorus, the Greeks killed more than 5,000 and captured 2,000 prisoners, ran down or captured their ships, and burned their weapons in dedication to their gods.\nThis battle meant the loss of the most important strategic Liburnian positions in the centre of the Adriatic, resulting in their final retreat to their main ethnic region, Liburnia, and their complete departure from the Italic coast, apart from Truentum. In Roman times, the town became known as Faria, which was turned into Hvar by the incoming Slav population. When the administrative capital of the island was moved to today's Hvar town on the south coast, the old town became simply known as Stari Grad (literally \"old city\" in Croatian)."

The settlement lay at the lower end of Stari Grad Bay, defended by two strongholds on the north and south hillsides overlooking the harbour (Glavica and Purkin Kuk).\nIn 384 BC, the town was formally founded by ancient Greeks from the island of Paros in the Aegean Sea.

The nearby plain was marked out with roads at right angles, and divided into fields of standard size. The Stari Grad Plain today represents one of the best-preserved examples of ancient Greek agriculture throughout the Mediterranean.\nIllyrian king Agron ruling c. 250\u2013231 BC. extended his rule over many cities in the Adriatic and established Illyrian control over Pharos.In 218 BC, the Romans defeated the Illyrian army at Pharos during the Second Illyrian War, and the town was destroyed by the Roman army, but remained under Illyrian control. The town came under permanent Roman control by force in 168 BC, following the defeat of Gentius during the Third Illyrian War.\nAn inscription from the 2nd century BC, refers to the Farians and their delegation to the Greek island of Paros and the oracle at Delphi. It makes mention of the Roman senate and the people (who are) well disposed and benevolent towards the city of Faros from the times of their ancestors. Further inscriptions, mosaics, tombstones, stone reliefs, fine pottery, jewellery, coins, villae rusticae in the Plain tell the story of life in and around the ancient Roman town.\nThe first church was built in the 5th century, in the southeast corner of the town, close to the city walls, on the foundations of a prior Greek house. In the 6th century, a new church was built on the same site, a twin basilica with a baptistry dedicated to St Mary and St John.\nIn the 7th century, following the fall of Salona, the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia, many of its people sought refuge in Faria and other Roman towns in the nearby islands, as noted by the historian Archdeacon Thomas of Split (1200\u20131268) in his Historia Salonitana.\nRoman Faria was taken over by the Slavs at the beginning of the 8th century. At this point, the town received the name we know it by today \u2013 Hvar (the letter F not being part of the old Slavic alphabet). During the 10th century, Hvar came under the Narentines. Pirates from Omi\u0161 on the mainland were raiding the coastal settlements, and new villages grew up in the foothills \u2013 Dol, Vrbanj and Pitve.\nIn 1278, the people of Hvar chose to put themselves under the protection of the Venetian Republic. As part of the contract, they undertook to expand the existing settlement on the south side of the island as a more suitable base for the Venetian fleet. This is the site of the present day town of Hvar. The old town of Stari Grad, also referred to as \"Old Hvar\", remained the centre of the most densely populated part of the island, the area surrounding the agricultural plain.\nDuring the 16th century, the town was attacked by the Turks, the first time repulsing them, but in 1571 they lost, and much of the town was burnt down. Following that loss, Stari Grad was slowly rebuilt from the ruins. During the 17th and 18th centuries, prosperity once again grew from sea-trade. The old waterfront (Stara Riva) was extended and the town underwent a major architectural and urban transformation, resulting in the town structure we see today.\nIn 1797 Napoleon overthrew the Venetian Republic, and Hvar briefly became part of the Austrian Empire. When the French also took over Austria, they conferred the status of an autonomous province on the town of Stari Grad. With the fall of the Napoleonic Empire, Stari Grad became part of the Dalmatian Kingdom, within the larger political body of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\nThe 19th century was peaceful, and a time of prosperity for the entire island. However, the advent of phylloxera destroyed the island's grapevines, and the town's sailing vessels could not compete with the new steam ships. Large numbers of people moved away to start a new life elsewhere. Today, Stari Grad is again rebuilding itself, this time with tourism as the main focus."

While Napoleon's army mauled an Allied army under Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher, the main Allied army commanded by Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, advanced to a position dangerously close to Paris. Gathering up his outnumbered forces, Napoleon rushed his soldiers south to deal with Schwarzenberg. Hearing of the approach of the French emperor, the Allied commander ordered a withdrawal, but on 17 February saw his rear guards overrun or brushed aside.\nOrdered to hold Montereau until nightfall on 18 February, the Crown Prince of W\u00fcrttemberg posted a strong force on the north bank of the Seine River. All morning and past noon, the Allies stoutly held off a series of French attacks. However, under increasing French pressure, the Crown Prince's lines buckled in the afternoon and his troops ran for the single bridge to their rear. Brilliantly led by Pierre Claude Pajol, the French cavalry got among the fugitives, captured the spans over both the Seine and Yonne Rivers and seized Montereau. The Allied force suffered heavy losses, and the defeat confirmed Schwarzenberg's decision to continue the retreat to Troyes."

The French captured 3,600 men, two cannons and two ammunition wagons. Of these totals, the Austrians had about 2,000 casualties and Sch\u00e4ffer became a French prisoner. The French lost 2,000 killed and wounded. A source quoted by Smith gave 4,895 Allied casualties and 15 guns lost. Francis Loraine Petre asserted that the Allies lost nearly 5,000 men and 15 field pieces. David G. Chandler stated that the Allies suffered 6,000 casualties and lost 15 cannons; the French lost 2,500 casualties. Another authority wrote that both the French and Allies lost 3,000 killed and wounded, while the French took 2,000 men, six guns and four colors. Chateau died from his wounds on 8 May 1814.The victory failed to live up to Napoleon's expectations. He lamented, \"The foe has enjoyed a stroke of rare good fortune, the heavy frosts permitted him to move over the fields \u2013 otherwise at least half his guns and transport would have been taken.\" In his disappointment he turned on his generals. After the battle when Victor complained to the emperor about losing his command, Napoleon unleashed a storm of abuse on his hapless subordinate. He also raged against Victor's wife who he accused of snubbing Empress Marie Louise. Victor managed to blunt his sovereign's fury by recalling their military exploits in Italy and by reminding Napoleon that his son-in-law Chateau lay dying. Finally, Napoleon relented and gave him the two Young Guard divisions of Charpentier and Joseph Boyer de Rebeval. Other generals who felt Napoleon's wrath at this time were Lh\u00e9ritier for failing to charge at Valjouan, Jean Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Dejean for not providing enough artillery ammunition and Claude-\u00c9tienne Guyot for losing some cannons.Even before the battle started, Schwarzenberg ordered a general withdrawal to Troyes. He ordered Wrede to hold Bray until nightfall on 19 February and sent a dispatch to Bl\u00fccher asking him to support his right flank at M\u00e9ry-sur-Seine on 21 February. The Prussian replied that he would be at the rendezvous with 53,000 troops and 300 guns. With Montereau in French hands, the position of the Austrians on the left flank along the Loing River became precarious. Under the guise of negotiations with Allix, they retreated to join the wreckage of Sch\u00e4ffer's brigade at Saint-S\u00e9rotin. Seslavin was ordered to relinquish his far left flank position and take a position on the opposite flank. Napoleon's pursuit was hampered by a lack of bridges and the Allies got a two-day head start in the march to Troyes. The next series of actions between the two armies started at M\u00e9ry-sur-Seine on 22 February and led to the Battle of Bar-sur-Aube."

The money for these subsidies was generated through an exclusive tax on companies which processed farm products. The Act created a new agency, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, also called \"AAA\" (1933\u20131942), an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to oversee the distribution of the subsidies. The Agriculture Marketing Act, which established the Federal Farm Board in 1929, was seen as an important precursor to this act.

From this Congress came the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, to replace the Federal Farm Board. The Roosevelt Administration was tasked with decreasing agricultural surpluses. Wheat, cotton, field corn, hogs, rice, tobacco, and milk and its products were designated as basic commodities in the original legislation. Subsequent amendments in 1934 and 1935 expanded the list of basic commodities to include rye, flax, barley, grain sorghum, cattle, peanuts, sugar beets, sugar cane, and potatoes. The administration targeted these commodities for the following reasons:\n\nChanges in the prices of these commodities had a strong effect on the prices of other important commodities.\nThese commodities were already running a surplus at the time.\nThese items each required some amount of processing before they could be consumed by humans."

These included the authorization by the Secretary of Agriculture (1) to secure voluntary reduction of the acreage in basic crops through agreements with producers and use of direct payments for participation in acreage control programs; (2) to regulate marketing through voluntary agreements with processors, associations or producers, and other handlers of agricultural commodities or products; (3) to license processors, association, and others handling agricultural commodities to eliminate unfair practices or charges; (4) to determine the necessity for and the rate or processing taxes; and (5) to use the proceeds of taxes and appropriate funds for the cost of adjustment operations, for the expansion of markets, and for the removal or agricultural surpluses.\"\"Congress declared its intent, at the same time, to protect the consumers interest. This was to be done by readjusting farm production at a level that would not increase the percentage of consumers' retail expenditures above the percentage returned to the farmer in the prewar base period.\"The juxtaposition of huge agricultural surpluses and the many deaths due to insufficient food shocked many, as well as some of the administrative decisions that happened under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. For example, in an effort to reduce agricultural surpluses, the government paid farmers to reduce crop production and to sell pregnant sows as well as young pigs. Oranges were being soaked with kerosene to prevent their consumption and corn was being burned as fuel because it was so cheap. There were many people, however, as well as livestock in different places starving to death. Farmers slaughtered livestock because feed prices were rising, and they could not afford to feed their own animals. Under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, \"plowing under\" of pigs was also common to prevent them reaching a reproductive age, as well as donating pigs to the Red Cross.In 1935, the income generated by farms was 50 percent higher than it was in 1932, which was partly due to farm programs such as the AAA.The Agricultural Adjustment Act affected around 99% of farmers in this time period."

        "content": "Tenant farming characterized the cotton and tobacco production in the post-Civil War South. As the agricultural economy plummeted in the early 1930s, all farmers were badly hurt but the tenant farmers and sharecroppers experienced the worst of it.To accomplish its goal of parity (raising crop prices to where they were in the golden years of 1909\u20131914), the Act reduced crop production. The Act accomplished this by offering landowners acreage reduction contracts, by which they agreed not to grow cotton on a portion of their land. By law, they were required to pay the tenant farmers and sharecroppers on their land a portion of the money; but after Southern Democrats in Congress complained, the Secretary of Agriculture surrendered and reinterpreted section 7 to no longer send checks to sharecroppers directly, hurting the tenants. The farm wage workers who worked directly for the landowner suffered the greatest unemployment as a result of the Act. There are few people gullible enough to believe that the acreage devoted to cotton can be reduced one-third without an accompanying decrease in the laborers engaged in its production. Researchers concluded that the statistics after the Act took effect  \"indicate a consistent and widespread tendency for cotton croppers and, to a considerable extent, tenants to decrease in numbers between 1930 and 1935. The decreases among Negroes were consistently greater than those among whites.\" Another consequence was that the historic high levels of mobility from year to year declined sharply, as tenants and croppers tended to stay longer with the same landowner.According to researchers Frey and Smith, \"To the extent that the AAA control-program has been responsible for the increased price [of cotton], we conclude that it has increased the amount of goods and services consumed by the cotton tenants and croppers area.\" Furthermore, the landowners typically let the tenants and croppers use the land taken out of cotton production for their own personal use in growing food and feed crops, which further increased their standard of living. Another consequence was that the historic high levels of turnover from year to year declined sharply, as tenants and croppers tend to stay with the same landowner. These researchers concluded, \"As a rule, planters seem to prefer Negroes to whites as tenants and croppers.\"\nHowever, according to researcher Harold C. Hoffsommer, many landlords were concerned that aid given directly to tenant farmers would have a \"demoralizing effect.\" An article appearing in the St. Louis Dispatch in 1935, quoted Hoffsommer's survey conducted for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. Tenant demoralization from relief had either one or both of two meanings to the landlord. In the first place, it might have been a fear that the tenant would escape from under his influence. It is probably not too much to say that the cropper system can only be maintained by the subordination of the tenant group. If the cropper were to become self-directing and take over his own affairs, the system would necessarily crumble. Hence anything that disrupts dependence is demoralizing. In the second place, the landlords were influenced by the belief that when members of any group are given privileges to which they are unaccustomed, they are likely in their inexperience to abuse them for a time. There can be no question that a considerable number of the sharecroppers reacted in this fashion, when under the Civil Works Administration, for example, they received more cash in a single week than they had been accustomed to receiving in an entire year. In their inexperience the money was spent foolishly and from this standpoint the outcome was demoralizing.Delta and Providence Cooperative Farms in Mississippi and the Southern Tenant Farmers Union were organized in the 1930s principally as a response to the hardships imposed on sharecroppers and tenant farmers.Although the Act stimulated American agriculture, it was not without its faults. For example, it disproportionately benefited large farmers and food processors, with lesser benefits to small farmers and sharecroppers. With the spread of cotton-picking machinery after 1945, there was an exodus of small farmers and croppers to the city."

Drafted by Senator Elmer Thomas of Oklahoma, the amendment blended populist easy-money views with the theories of the New Economics. Thomas wanted a stabilized \"honest dollar,\" one that would be fair to debtor and creditor alike.The Amendment said that whenever the President desired currency expansion, he must first authorize the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve to purchase up to $3 billion of federal obligations. Should open market operations prove insufficient, the President had several options. He could have the U.S. Treasury issue up to $3 billion in greenbacks, reduce the gold content of the dollar by as much as 50 percent, or accept 100 million dollars in silver at a price not to exceed fifty cents per ounce in payment of World War I debts owed by European nations.The Thomas Amendment was used sparingly. The treasury received limited amounts of silver in payment for war debts from World War I. On 21 December 1933, Roosevelt ratified the London Agreement on Silver (adopted at the World Economic and Monetary Conference in London on 20 July 1933). At the same time, Roosevelt issued Proclamation 2067, ordering the United States mints to buy the entire domestic production of newly mined silver at 64.5\u00a2 per ounce. \"Roosevelt's most dramatic use of the Thomas amendment\" came on 31 January 1934, when he decreased the gold content of the dollar to 15 5/21 grains (0.98741 grams) .900 fine gold, or 59.06 per cent of the previous fixed content (25 8/10 grains, or 1.6718 grams).  \"However, wholesale prices still continued to climb. Possibly the most significant expansion brought on by the Thomas Amendment may have been the growth of governmental power over monetary policy.The impact of this amendment was to reduce the amount of silver that was being held by private citizens (presumably as a hedge against inflation or collapse of the financial system) and increase the amount of circulating currency."

After Frick's wife Adelaide Frick died in 1931, John Russell Pope converted the Frick House into a museum, which opened on December 16, 1935. The museum acquired additional works of art over the years, and it expanded the house in 1977 to accommodate increasing visitation. Following fundraising campaigns in the 2000s, a further expansion was announced in the 2010s. The museum was temporarily housed at 945 Madison Avenue from 2021 to 2024, during the renovation of the Frick House.\nThe Frick has about 1,500 pieces in its collection as of 2021. Artists with works in the collection have included Bellini, Fragonard, Goya, Holbein, Rembrandt, Titian, Turner, Vel\u00e1zquez, Vermeer, and Thomas Gainsborough. The museum has gradually acquired additional pieces over the years to supplement the paintings in Frick's original collection. In addition to its permanent collection, the museum has hosted small temporary exhibitions on narrowly defined topics, as well as  academic symposiums, concerts, and classes. The Frick Collection typically accommodates up to 300,000 annual visitors and has an endowment fund to support its programming. Commentary on the museum over the years has been largely positive, particularly in relation to the works themselves and their juxtaposition with the Frick House."

        "content": "Henry Clay Frick was a coke and steel magnate. As early as 1870, he had hung pictures throughout his house in Broadford, Pennsylvania. Frick acquired the first painting in his permanent collection, Luis Jim\u00e9nez's In the Louvre, in 1880, after moving to Pittsburgh. He did not begin buying paintings in large numbers until the mid-1890s, and he began devoting significant amounts of time to his collection. This made Frick one of several prominent American businessmen who also collected art, along with figures such as Henry Havemeyer and J. P. Morgan. In explaining why he collected art, Frick said, \"I can make money... I cannot make pictures.\" He curated his collection with the help of Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen.When the Frick family moved from Pittsburgh to New York City in 1905, they leased the William H. Vanderbilt House at 640 Fifth Avenue, and Frick expanded his collection during that time. The collection was spread across their homes in New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. Thomas Hastings of Carr\u00e8re and Hastings designed Frick's permanent house at 1 East 70th Street, which was completed in 1914. The house had been designed with the collection in mind.James Howard Bridge, Frick's personal assistant, was hired as the house's curator in 1914 and worked at the house for fourteen years. Frick, who was known for being especially particular in his tastes, spent an estimated $10 million to acquire pieces during his lifetime. Duveen opened four art-purchasing accounts for Frick, including two accounts specifically for art from Morgan's estate."

        "content": "The Frick has a collection of old master paintings and furniture housed in 19 galleries of varying size within the former residence. Frick ultimately acquired a variety of European paintings, Renaissance bronzes, French clocks, and a set of porcelains. Toward the end of Frick's life, he focused on porcelains, sculptures, and furniture. Although Frick made over a thousand acquisitions over his lifetime, he resold most of the things he bought. The original collection contained 635 pieces of art or decorations when Frick died. When the museum opened, it displayed 136 or about 200 paintings in addition to porcelains, enamels, and bronzes. There were also 80 sculptures on display.Helen Clay Frick and the board of trustees expanded the collection after his death; in 2006, the New York Times estimated that about 30 percent of the collection had been acquired after Frick died. Nonetheless, until 1948, the museum accepted donations of art only from Frick family members. The museum can lend works acquired after Frick's death, but not works that he owned in his lifetime; this restriction has prevented works from appearing in other museums' exhibitions. The Frick is also prohibited from selling items in its collection and seldom acquires new works. Some of the works are normally not visible to the public but can be displayed as necessary. The Frick has sometimes borrowed paintings for long periods, including a portrait of Cosimo de' Medici that was displayed in the museum from 1970 to 1989. Purchases of new art were funded by the museum's endowment until 2016, when the museum's trustees established an acquisitions fund.As of 2021, the museum has 1,500 pieces in its collection, including both paintings and other objects; it normally displays 470 objects. Prior to the museum's 2021 renovation, the artwork was displayed in 15 galleries."

The house spans an entire blockfront on Fifth Avenue between 70th and 71st Streets. The original structure from 1914 was designed by Thomas Hastings in the Beaux-Arts style. The same style is also used for the 1970s reception wing, designed by Harry Van Dyke, John Barrington Bayley, and G. Frederick Poehler. Both structures have a facade of Indiana Limestone. The house has a lawn that is mostly closed to the public.The interiors were designed by a variety of people. The British decorator Charles Allom furnished most of the rooms on the ground floor, while the majority of the rooms on the second and third floors were decorated by Elsie de Wolfe. Charles Carstairs and Joseph Duveen provided the original decorations for the rooms. Inside the house are the museum's galleries (adapted from the old living spaces of the mansion), as well as a courtyard with reflecting pool, the latter of which is based on a Roman atrium. Some parts of the house have been modified over the years specifically to accommodate the artwork, including a room for the Fragonard panels. In addition to the artwork and artifacts on display, there are bookcases placed throughout the Frick House's rooms, and some rooms have various other pieces of furniture such as a dining table."

The library is housed at a 13-story building at 10 East 71st Street (next to the original mansion). Prior to the library building's opening, the basement bowling alley was used as storage space for the library's collection. The library has always been open to the public, except during World War II, when it was closed for six months, and during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 renovation, when it was shuttered while being moved to the Frick Madison. The library is typically open free of charge to \"any adult with a serious interest in art\". In the late 20th century, the library served 6,000 people a year on average, most of whom made advance reservations or requests.Helen Frick acted as director for six decades, during which time its collection expanded to include 50,000 sales catalogs, 400,000 photographs, and 150,000 books. By the 1990s, the library had an estimated 235,000 volumes, which grew to 280,000 by the late 2000s. The collections of the library focus on art of the Western tradition from the fourth century to the mid-twentieth century, and chiefly include information about paintings, drawings, sculpture, prints, and illuminated manuscripts. Archival materials supplement its research collections. The Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive contains over a million photocopies of artwork, including objects that are not in the museum's collection.The Frick has been part of the New York Art Resources Consortium (NYARC), which also includes the Museum of Modern Art and Brooklyn Museum, since 2007. NYARC operates Arcade, an online catalog that combines the collections of the three museums' libraries. The Center for the History of Collecting, also founded in 2007, is also part of the library. The Frick is a member of the International Consortium of Photo Archives (PHAROS), which operates a database of digitized artworks from the collections of 14 art museums."

        "content": "Little Salt Spring is a feature of the karst topography of Florida, specifically an example of a sinkhole. It is classified as a third magnitude spring. The numerous deep vents at the bottom of the sinkhole feed oxygen-depleted groundwater into it, producing an anoxic environment below a depth of about 5 m (16.4 ft). This fosters the preservation of Paleo-Indian and early Archaic artifacts and ecofacts, as well as fossil bones of the extinct megafauna once found in Florida.Little Salt Spring was considered a shallow freshwater pond, but in the 1950s SCUBA divers discovered that it was a true sinkhole extending downward over 200 ft (61 m), similar to the cenotes of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula (another karst region). The actual depth of the surface pond is forty feet (12.2 m) with a central shaft dropping vertically to an inverted cone with a maximum determined depth at the outer edges of 245 feet (75 m). There are ledges around the wall of the cenote at 16 and 27 meters (52 and 89 feet) below the present water level.\nThe water level in the spring has varied over time. Twelve to thirteen thousand years ago the ocean level was about 100 meters (more than 300 feet) lower than at present, drawing down the water table in Florida, and the water level in Little Salt Spring was 27 meters (89 feet) lower than at present. The basin around the spring and a slough extending away from it are filled with moist, soft peat.\nOn July 10, 1979, the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2013, the University of Miami began considering selling the site to Sarasota County Government, due to funding being cut towards maintaining the site and its facilities."

The vineyards are located just south of Vienne in the communes of Saint-Cyr-sur-le-Rh\u00f4ne, Ampuis, and Tupin-et-Semons. The vineyards are unique because of the steep slopes facing the river and their stone walls. C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie can be rendered in English as \"the roasted slope\" and refers to the long hours of sunlight that these steep slopes receive.The wines are red, made with Syrah grapes and up to 20% Viognier, a white grape used for its aroma. According to appellation rules, Syrah and Viognier (if used) must be fermented at the same time, a process known as cofermentation. Because of this combination, C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie wine typically exhibits an almost paradoxical pairing of meat aromas (including bacon) and floral aromas."

        "content": "The C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie, and more generally the northern Rh\u00f4ne, has a continental climate that is very different from the more Mediterranean climate of the southern Rh\u00f4ne. Winters are wet and marked by the cold mistral winds that can last into the spring. During the late spring and early autumn, fog can settle on the vineyards making the ripening of grapes a challenge. The wine region covers 202 hectares (500 acres)  along the western bank of the Rh\u00f4ne River near the village of Ampuis. In the C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie, the Rh\u00f4ne flows southwest for 9.7 kilometers (6.0 mi). To maximize the amount of sunshine that the vines receive (especially with the fog that often develops near the grape harvest time), vineyards will more often be planted on the south- or southeast-facing slopes along this part of the river. The C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie is subdivided into two main sections of varying soil compositions - the C\u00f4te Brune (\"brown slope\") in the north on dark, iron-rich schist and the C\u00f4te Blonde with its pale granite and schist soil. Erosion is a common viticultural hazard on these steep vineyards. The granite and schist soils are vital in retaining heat throughout the day to protect the vines from the chilly temperatures during the mistral seasons. Stone walls are built around the lands, and the hillsides are often heavily terraced to try to counter the issues. Some vineyard owners gather the eroded soils and rocks in buckets and carry them back up the slope to the vines."

        "content": "Syrah and Viognier are the only permitted grape varieties of the C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie AOC. While many of the region's wines are made of 100% Syrah, up to 20% of Viognier can be added to the wine. The wines are often meant to be consumed 5\u20136 years after vinification but well-made examples can need 10\u201315 years to fully develop their flavors with some wines having the aging potential of over 20 years. The most distinctive characteristic of all C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie wine is the aroma. The fragrant notes of these wines often include green olives, raspberry, violets, and meaty bacon. Other flavors commonly associated with C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie wine include black pepper, white pepper, blueberry, blackberry, plum, and leather. The vines of the region are very old, with 40 years being an average and some vines being over 100. This produces low wine yields of very flavor-concentrated fruit. Most of the vineyards used for producing C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie AOC are planted on the slopes of nearly 60\u00b0 incline. The appellation extends to the flatter plateau above the slopes but the wine there is generally of lower quality and is sold with the more generic C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne AOC.Legend has that the two sub-regions of the C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie, C\u00f4te Blonde and C\u00f4te Brune, were named after the blonde and brown hair colored daughters of a local lord who had two very different personalities. Similarly, the wines of both regions also have different characteristics. Wines of the C\u00f4te Blonde are often more balanced, elegant and meant to be consumed earlier. Wines of the iron-rich C\u00f4te Brune contain more tannins, are full-bodied and meant to age longer in the bottle prior to being consumed. Traditionally, most C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie wines are blends of grapes from the two sub-regions, incorporating both sets of distinctive qualities.In recent years, more single vineyard designated wines have been produced that emphasize the terroir of that vineyard. Marcel Guigal was an early pioneer in single vineyard bottling. Some of the most prestigious vineyards in the C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie include, La Chatillone, La Chevali\u00e8re, La Garde, La Landonne, La Mouline, La Turque."

        "content": "The earliest record of viticulture in the region dates to the 2nd century BC when the Romans first encountered the Allobroges tribe whose territory included the regions around Vienne. While winemaking continued to have a long history in the region, the C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie did not receive much recognition until the 18th century when Parisians began discovering the wines of Beaujolais and Rh\u00f4ne. Around the same time, the British also discovered the wines with the purchase logs of John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol providing one of the earliest English records of \"C\u00f4te-R\u00f4ty\" (sic) wine. There were added considerations with the transportation of C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie wine, with the region using 20-U.S. gallon (76 liter) amphora-like vases for transport instead of barrels or early wine bottles.Until a few decades ago, C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie was not a serious competitor to Hermitage, which was the best-known northern Rh\u00f4ne vineyard internationally. Demand for Rh\u00f4ne wines began to grow in the early 1970s, and this growth accelerated from the late 1970s/early 1980s. For C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie it was the wines of Marcel Guigal which gave the appellation increased attention from the early 1980s. This included top marks from international wine critics for Guigal's wines La Mouline and La Landonne. This increase in demand led to new vineyards being created. From 1982 to 2005, the area with planted vines increased from 102 hectares (250 acres) to 231 hectares (570 acres).The origins of the C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie most famous planting\u2014Syrah\u2014is confirmed to be indigenous to the Rhone valley.

        "content": "The land area that was to become the present-day Saraland was included in a Spanish land grant to Don Diego Alvarez. Hence, descendants of Alvarez were the ones to give the community its first name: Alvarez Station. Later land squatters moved into the area and were able, legally, in 1800 to begin purchasing property. In 1807, a land office was opened in St. Stephens to handle all land transactions. Some of the pioneer families who seized the opportunity to buy up sections were named Alvarez, Rice, Hartley, Moore, LaCoste, Williams, Tool and Cleveland. Eventually, Alvarez Station was called Cleveland Station. The present name of the city is reported to have been given by C.J. DeWitt, a retired minister editor who moved south in 1890 for health reasons. He opened the first post office on the Southern Railroad in 1895. The community is purported to be the namesake of his beloved wife, Sara.\nSaraland was sparsely populated during the first part of the 20th century, until an industrial and population boom occurred in neighboring Mobile. Northward expansion of Mobile in the 1940s and 50s brought about the incorporation of Saraland in 1957. At the time of incorporation, the city reported only 125 residents. By the 1960 U.S. Census, annexations had swelled the population to 4,595. In 1980, census figures cited 9,844 Saraland residents. As of the 2020 census, Saraland's population had grown to 16,171.The worst rail disaster in the history of Amtrak occurred just east of Saraland on Big Bayou Canot on September 22, 1993. At approximately 2:53 AM, Amtrak's Sunset Limited train, powered by three locomotives, and en route from Los Angeles to Miami with 220 passengers and crew aboard, crossed the Bayou Canot bridge at high speed and derailed at a kink in the track caused by a barge captain who rammed the bridge by making a wrong turn in the waterway and failed to report the accident. 47 people, of whom 42 were passengers, were killed, many by drowning, others by fire. Much of the rescue efforts were average citizens of the community who journeyed out in the early morning hours in small fishing boats to help at the scene."

        "content": "Gimzo was first mentioned in the Bible in the approximate period of 740 BC, when the Philistines conquered the area from the hands of King Ahaz of Israel. It is reported that \"the Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the Negev of Judah, and had taken Beit Shemesh, Ayalon, Gederoth, and Sokho with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages, and they settled there\".The name Gimzo is thought to derive from the fruit of the sycamore tree known as \"Gomez\" which was abundant in this area, based on the biblical verse: \"The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the lowland.\" In the Talmudic period, Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: \"A sign of mountains is \"milin\", a sign of valleys is palm trees, a sign of rivers is cane, and a sign of the plains is Sycamore trees, and whereas there is no proof of this, we remember the words: And he made cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the lowland\". Moshav Gimzo was the home of the sage Nachum Ish Gamzu, who was wont to say \"It is all for the best\" which translates to \"Gam-zo le-tova\", a word play on the name of his home at \"Gam-zo\".In 1917, the British, under the command of General Edmund Allenby, took control of Palestine. The Palestinian village of Jimzu was cited as the rendezvous point for the British 52nd division, for its advance to Jerusalem through the Beit Horon Pass.During the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, \"Operation Dani\" was planned to occupy Lod, Ramla, Latrun, and Ramallah, and to release the pressure around Jerusalem. Plans for this operation mention Jimzu, and on 10 July 1948, the Yiftah Brigade captured the settlements of Anabe, Jimzu, Daniyal and Dahariya. Jimzu was depopulated, and its inhabitants became refugees.The moshav was founded by a group of immigrants from Hungary on 28 February 1950. The founders were a group of Satmar Chassidim called Etz Chaim (\"tree of life\"), affiliated with the Poalei Agudat Yisrael party.In 1951 the Israeli government settled a group of immigrants from Morocco in the moshav to enlarge the population. In 1977, a new group of 12 young families settled there as well.\nThe moshav has grown substantially, having absorbed new families, and has built a new neighborhood with housing for Gimzo's newer generation.  Today the moshav consists of 140 families with over 700 residents, including ultra-orthodox and orthodox Jewish residents of both Sephardic and Ashkenazi backgrounds who lead a \"religious-Zionist lifestyle\"."

Grande, on the other hand, was affixed to the appellation because at the time, the place was a vast wilderness covering Sitio Tejero, frequently called by the revolutionary as Salinas (present-day Rosario), Santa Cruz de Malabon or Malabon el Chico (present-day Tanza) and Tierra Alta (present-day Noveleta).

The linen industry was booming during this time. It was declining in an area such as Ballybay due to the mechanisation of the site, the power sail and the power of the steam boiler.\nDuring the First World War, the town was established as a major horse trading post, supporting trades such as harness makers, blacksmiths, blacksmiths and nailers.\nThe town commissioners had meetings in 1871 with bank representatives, businessmen, and various people who were interested in the development of the town. In terms of town layout, water supply, street lighting and a waste management plan were established.\nAfter that, markets and events were taking place in the centre of the town and there were goods such as linseed, a bag of corn, meat, horses and farm fruit."

Over the last 30 years, following a trend that is endemic throughout the Bay Area, home prices have climbed in Mill Valley (the median price for a single-family home was in excess of $1.5 million as of 2005), which has had the effect of pushing out some residents who can no longer afford to live in the area. This trend has also transformed Mill Valley's commercial activity, with nationally recognized music store Village Music having closed, then replaced in 2008 by more commercial establishments.In July 2005, CNN/Money and Money magazine ranked Mill Valley tenth on its list of the 100 Best Places to Live in the United States. In 2007, MSN and Forbes magazine ranked Mill Valley seventy-third on its \"Most expensive zip codes in America\" list.While Mill Valley has retained elements of its earlier artistic culture through galleries, festivals, and performances, its stock of affordable housing has diminished, forcing some residents to leave the area. This trend has also affected some of the city's well-known cultural centers like Village Music and the Sweetwater Saloon. As of April 2007, only one affordable housing project was underway: an initiative to renovate and expand a century old but now abandoned local landmark roadhouse and saloon called the Fireside Inn. This renovation was completed in the fall of 2008 and provided around 50 low-income apartments, with around 30 dedicated to low-income seniors and the remainder going to low-income families."

During the depression of the 1890s, under the Settlement on Lands Act (1893) in response to poverty, inspired by the idealism of the Rev. Horace Finn Tucker, land around The Patch was divided into 10-acre farming selections and for unemployed city people, most of whom lived in earth-floored paling shacks with of calico instead of glass for windows and who cooked with stream water over camp fires. Many of the people sent had little knowledge of farming or the bush and were doomed to failure. However berry growing was established successfully in the area by the late 1890s, though it was made difficult by poor transport through the hills to metropolitan markets. A successful grower Daniel Camm established Monbulk Jams, with sales worldwide.The Post Office opened on 1 September 1908. A Post Office also opened at Fairy Dell on 1 July 1916 and closed in 1971.The Anglican church was built in 1934, the community hall in the 1950s and the primary school in 1983\u20134.

Selena Etc. finished its building on January 27, 1994, in Corpus Christi, Texas, which was the headquarters. \nSelena opened another boutique in San Antonio, Texas, around the same time the headquarters building was complete; both were equipped with in-house beauty salons.Among the employees there was the president of her fan club, Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, who had been promoted to manager of her two boutiques, as well as controlling Selena's business checking accounts. However, she would lose this position after several employees began to approach Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla, and they informed him that they had overdue payments on their payrolls, so upon initiating an investigation in this regard, Quintanilla was convinced that Sald\u00edvar was embezzling money.On March 9, 1995, Abraham, Selena, and her sister Suzette confronted Sald\u00edvar and accused her of stealing money from the boutiques and the fan club, firing her immediately, although Selena continued to contact her due to the fact that she had several financial documents in her possession that she needed to have back. Another boutique was planned to open in Monterrey, Mexico, in 1995, but on March 31 of that year, Sald\u00edvar would murder Selena by shooting her in the back after asking her to meet at the Days Inn motel in order to return her the financial records and documents she still had. After her death, Chris P\u00e9rez, Selena's widower, took over the business. The San Antonio boutique was closed sometime after 1999.After the 16th anniversary of the opening of the Corpus Christi boutique, the store was officially closed as of July 1, 2009. A week after the store closed, P\u00e9rez placed a \"for sale\" sign in front of the building. The appraised price of the land and structure was USD$91,454 according to the Nueces County Appraisal District. Perez' asking price for the property was $165,000. The Selena Etc. store had a full-service salon, as well as Selena memorabilia. They also sold jewelry, hats and other accessories. Soon after the foreclosure, due to the low economy, all merchandise and accessories began selling at the \"Selena Museum\", located several miles from where the Selena Etc. building once was.\n\n\n== References =="

The shipyards are owned and operated mainly by local families such as Gazzier Marine Services, Metal Shark (formerly Horizon Shipbuilding), Steiner Ship Yard, Rodriguez Boat Builders, Master Boat Builders, Williams Fabrication, and Landry Boat Works.\nPeople from all over the world including the United States, South America, and Africa have boats built in Bayou La Batre frequently. In 2005, Steiner Ship Yard was asked by Walt Disney Studios to build a pirate ship, the Black Pearl; the pitch-black ship was actually a huge wooden prop built on top of a modern 96-foot-long steel utility boat. Crews sailed the ship out of the bayou to the Caribbean for the filming of sequels to Disney's 2003 film \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\".\nAnother ship, the FV Cornelia Marie from the Deadliest Catch series, was built in Bayou La Batre in 1989."

The city includes Booth (formerly Alba) Elementary School, Alba Middle School, and Alma Bryant High School, where all the high school students attend. Additionally, a small number of city residents' children attend Dixon Elementary in Irvington.Both Alma Bryant and Booth Elementary are located on the northernmost edge of the city. Bryant, built in 1998, slightly delayed by Hurricane Georges, and Booth, built in 2006, delayed by Hurricane Katrina, are located on Hurricane Boulevard. Both schools' students were (in part) located in what is now Alba Middle School further south in Bayou La Batre. Alba High School first combined with Grand Bay High School in 1998 in the newly built, centrally located Alma Bryant High School, located on 16th Section land (land dedicated for school purposes). Alba Middle (which was in great part located in portable classrooms and was a part of the high School campus, as was Grand Bay Middle) took over the high school building, greatly relieving overcrowding. Similarly, the Alba Elementary Campus which shared land with the middle school, while being mostly autonomous, also became part of Alba Middle School. Alba and Grand Bay Middle are the focal point of bus routes for all school buses for Bryant High, those buses shared in grades 6-12 as a cost-saving effort to avoid overlapping routes for the separate schools.\nIn December 2007, a new library was opened to serve the area's Asian-American community. The library is located on Wintzell Avenue in the Bayou La Batre office of Boat People SOS, a national group that assists Vietnamese-Americans. The Mobile County Commission gave $2,500. The library will be used as a place where elderly immigrants can master computer skills, children can practice their Vietnamese after school, and day laborers can surf the Web after work."

The house was bought by the Bolivian explorer and entrepreneur Antonio Vaca Diez.\n\nLa Casa de Fierro is one of the finest as well as best-preserved samples of civil architecture in Peru. The walls, ceiling, and balcony are plastered in rectangular sheets of iron. It is said to be the first prefabricated house in the Americas. Although popularly said to have been designed by the French architect Gustave Eiffel, there is no evidence at all that this is true; the building does not reflect his architectural style. Since 2011 well substantiated claims prove it was built in the Belgian workshops of Les Forges d'Aiseau (Joseph Danly process). Rubber baron Anselmo del Aguila bought it at the International Exposition of Paris in 1889. Once dismantled, it was brought in pieces to Iquitos (the metal sheets were carried by hundreds of men through the jungle), and assembled there in 1890.Since 1985, it is being administered by the Club Social de Iquitos; which has contributed in its restoration. Its second floor now has a restaurant. Today the house servers as a restaurant in the second, La Casa de Fierro Restaurante, and stores in the ground level.\nA fully different story of the origin of the house is told in Mario Vargas Llosa's Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (Pantale\u00f3n y las visitadoras), a comic novel."

By the 1890s, the pearling fleet was the only reason for continued settlement. The settlement was destroyed on 4 March 1899, when Cyclone Mahina passed through northern Queensland. Cyclone Mahina was notable for producing the highest recorded storm surge of any tropical cyclone in history. The once-abundant forests have not regrown, mainly because of continuing salt damage to the land by the storm surge. Since the Federation of Australia in 1901, Bathurst Bay has become a popular fishing area. Few people have settled the bay area."

Founded in response to commercial galleries and major national collecting institutions, Artspace was conceived as an alternative exhibition space committed to working with emerging and early-career artists.Artspace was originally located at 11 Randle Street, Surry Hills, a former hat factory built in 1912. This building was destroyed in a major fire in 2023. Artspace opened at its Surry Hills location with its first major exhibition \u2018A Different Perspective\u2019 curated by Terence Maloon in conjunction with the Multicultural Artists Agency. In its early years, Artspace exhibited works by then-early career artists including Mikala Dwyer, Rosemary Laing, Lindy Lee, Banduk Marika, Tracey Moffatt, John Nixon, Michael Riley, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula.\nIn 1992, Artspace relocated to its current location, The Gunnery, in Woolloomooloo. The now heritage listed site was originally erected as a bulk store for the Sydney Morning Herald at the turn of the 20th Century, and later used by the Commonwealth Government for defence purposes until its decommissioning in 1948. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the building was principally used as a squat by artists and as a space for studios, performances and exhibitions. In 1989, the NSW Government proposed to sell The Gunnery for redevelopment. Artists successfully protested this sale to the Land & Environment Court, keeping The Gunnery in the public eye and preventing its demolition. In 1991, the NSW Government proposed that the building become a centre for visual arts, with Artspace moving in to the space the following year.In 2015, Artspace secured $150,000 funding to redevelop the ground floor of The Gunnery. This redevelopment funding also made way for an expanded artistic program including the Ideas Platform, Volume book fair, and the rent-free One Year Studio residencies for artists at all stages of their careers.\nIn 2021, Artspace began its transformation into a landmark multi-platform contemporary art centre with expanded exhibition spaces, increased artist studios and greater connections to Woolloomooloo, the East Sydney precinct and Sydney Harbour Foreshore. News of Artspace's redevelopment was announced by Minister for the Arts Don Harwin: From a famed artist squat in the 70s and 80s, to the studio space, gallery and home to resident artist organisations in the early 90s, to the cultural landmark it is today, The Gunnery will be transformed once again to an exciting new cultural destination for the people of NSW ... For almost thirty years, Artspace has called The Gunnery home, playing a significant role in transforming the site to the premier cultural destination it is today. Through Artspace, The Gunnery will continue to be an inclusive place of gathering for communities anchored in Woolloomooloo. The redevelopment will reorient the entrance of Artspace to Forbes Street Plaza and will include expanded exhibition space on the ground floor, while the first floor will be upgraded to include spaces for education, outreach, digital broadcast, performance, production and public program space. Artspace will reopen to the public in the summer of 2023."

Weser shipyard in Bremen for Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL), she was requisitioned at the start of the Second World War in 1939, converted into an auxiliary cruiser at Howaldtswerke in Hamburg, and commissioned into the Kriegsmarine on 2 June 1940. The ship was 115.5 m long and 15.3 m wide, had a draught of 6.5 m, and registered 3,287 gross register tons (GRT). She was powered by two diesel engines that gave her a speed of up to 16 knots (30 km/h).\nAs a commerce raider, Komet was armed with six 15 cm guns, one 7.5 cm gun, one 3.7 cm and four 2 cm AA guns, as well as six torpedo tubes.

        "content": "The Komet was prepared for a second raiding voyage in October 1942, after 11 months of complete repair. Only two of her original officers had remained on board and Kapit\u00e4n zur See Ulrich Brocksien took over command.On 7 October 1942 the raider, disguised as a minesweeper, departed from the Dutch-occupied port of Vlissingen with the objective \nof reaching the Atlantic. After a short stay in Dunquerque, on 12 October the Komet set course towards Le Havre.\nInitial attempts by the Royal Navy to attack the ship in the Straits of Dover had failed. On 13 October, Komet sailed from Le Havre with an escort of four or\nfive Type 35 torpedo boats. Unsure of the exact route that the German ship would follow, and aware of the fast speed of the German vessels, four groups of warships were assembled to make an interception to the West of the Cherbourg Peninsula. Group A, consisted of HMS Cottesmore, Quorn, Albrighton, Glaisdale and Eskdale. Two flotillas of MTBs made up Groups C and D. These three groups headed for a position near Cap de la Hague. Group B (the destroyers Brocklesby, Fernie, Tynedale and the Polish Krakowiak) were further West, near the Channel Islands.\nThe German convoy were spotted by a Coastal Command aircraft in the middle of the Baie de la Seine, travelling at 16 knots, and groups A,C and D hurried to get into position. In the particularly dark night and moderately rough sea conditions, the MTB flotillas became separated from the destroyers.\nAt just before 1:00 am, Cottesmore sighted the German vessels. The Allied ships fired star shells to illuminate the target and then opened fire. To the British attackers, the Germans appeared taken completely by surprise and in the confusion, opened fire on each other, until eventually firing torpedoes at the Allied ships (all of which missed). Two of the escorts were on fire and the other German ships turned inshore to gain the protection of the coastal artillery batteries.\nThe most junior commanding officer in group D was Sub-Lieutenant Robert Drayson, who had just taken over in MTB 236 after the previous C.O. had gone sick. As junior, Drayson was last in the line of MTBs and became separated from the rest of the flotilla as they crossed the Channel. Drayson continued independently to Cap de La Hague. None of the other Allied MTBs arrived in the area. After a while, Drayson saw star shells and tracer as the battle started and increased speed. He decided to approach the action from the shoreward side to catch any German vessel trying to get away. This put MTB 236 in position to see Komet illuminated by a star shell. The German ship was travelling at more than 15 knots, exchanging fire with the Allied destroyers who were in pursuit. Drayson's MTB was ahead of the German ship and crept in at slow speed to fire two torpedoes at a range of 500 yards. MTB 236 immediately turned away and \"crash-started\" her main engines to escape under cover of a smoke-screen. Komet had now sighted her and switched fire. Within a few seconds, both torpedoes struck Komet, followed by a huge secondary explosion. The force of this blast lifted the stern of MTB 236 out of the water and put out of action two of the boat's three engines, leaving her to return home at reduced speed.\nGroup B had moved to join the battle and engaged some of the remaining German vessels, but with the main target gone and shore battery fire now becoming more accurate, broke off the action and returned home.\nKomet sank with no survivors. Sub-Lt Drayson was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his part in the action. The Allied forces experienced only two minor casualties, despite being under heavy fire."

The 96.5 frequency in Gatineau was later reassigned to CFTX-FM, and Fondation Radio-Enfant was granted a permanent AM license in early 2007 to operate at 1670 kHz.Initially, CJEU played music mainly in French and sung by children. Most of the music that is played, however, was not professionally recorded.In late 2010, the station was renamed as Radio Oxyg\u00e8ne, expanding its programming to include programs for teenagers and young adults. Programming for younger listeners was renamed Radio-Enfant-Ado.

It was originally named the Deutsche Motorradfahrer-Vereinigung (German Motorcyclist Association). In 1911, due to an enormous growth in membership of car owners, it was renamed the Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club (ADAC). The Prussian eagle was selected as the emblem in the club's badge, in appreciation of the Prussian royal family's support and patronage. Its most senior figure at the time was German Emperor and King of Prussia Wilhelm II.The ADAC breakdown assistance service was launched in Germany in 1927 under the name of ADAC-Stra\u00dfen-Hilfsdienst.After 1933, during Gleichschaltung, the Nazi Party amalgamated all motoring organisations in Germany into the DDAC (Der Deutsche Automobil-Club e.V.), an umbrella association that was allowed to exist in the shadow of the NSKK (National Socialist Motor Corps). A DDAC appeal described the 1934 international Automobile Exhibition as a \"show for the people\" rather than an \"exhibition for the more affluent bourgeois segment\" of society. \"Motoring for the people\" (Volkskraftfahrt), it proclaimed, was more \"in the spirit of the F\u00fchrer\".After business activities resumed in 1946, roadside assistance was revived in 1954 under the name ADAC-Stra\u00dfenwacht (\"road patrol\"). In 1954 Heinz Fr\u00f6lich became the first of (in that year) 56 ADAC patrolmen equipped with a motorcycle and sidecar, the latter of which had a large compartment filled with tools and parts for roadside repairs. These original \"Gelber Engel\" (\"Yellow Angels\") used NSU Konsul motorcycles. At the end of 1962, ADAC announced the retirement of their motorbike-sidecar combinations, which would be replaced by 40 appropriately equipped Volkswagen Beetles. Equipment on the new cars included a flashing roof light, repair tools, a radio communication device, compressed air canisters, a spade and broom set, and a basic \"doctor kit\" incorporating blood plasma.In 1974, the organisation had 3.8 million members at a time when there were 19.0 million passenger cars registered in Germany. By 1990, membership had risen to 10.2 million, with 35.5 million passenger cars registered in the country, so ADAC membership grew more than twice as fast as national car ownership. Growth rates during the ensuing twenty years were greatly boosted by German reunification.\nIn May 2012 the organisation welcomed its 18 millionth member, and in May 2013 the ADAC fitted out its 10,000th roadside assistance vehicle, a Volkswagen Touran, with several hundred different tools and replacement parts.In 1997, ADAC opened its new technical centre in Landsberg am Lech, Bavaria.\nIn 2003, ADAC voiced criticism of the supervised driving at age 17 pilot program in Lower Saxony, and celebrated its 100th anniversary.\nIn 2007, the ADAC Stiftung \"Gelber Engel\" foundation was established. This foundation financially supports survivors of road accidents, and funds accident rescue and accident research initiatives and institutions.The ADAC Stiftung \"Gelber Engel\" (\"ADAC 'Yellow Angel' Foundation\") has supported victims of road accidents since 2007. In September 2013, that foundation was registered as a gGmbH (a non-profit company).At the end of 2019, ADAC had 21.2 million members."

        "content": "The pier was constructed between 1912 and 1915 by the Melbourne Harbor Trust to supplement the adjacent Station Pier (originally the 'Railway Pier'). From completion in 1915 until 1969 it was also a major arrival point for new migrants, particularly during the post-war period. In addition to a pier, there was a gatehouse and barriers, terminal building, amenities rooms, goods lockers, ablution blocks, railway sidings and passenger gangways.From opening the pier was linked by rail to the Port Melbourne railway line, via double lines branching from the Melbourne side of Graham station. Eight railway tracks ran onto the bridge, four along either face. A passenger rail service was provided to the pier after 30 May 1921 operated by suburban electric trains. Running when ships were docked at the pier, it was usually operated by a single double ended 'swing door' motor car until the service ended in November 1930, because it was not financially rewarding for the Victorian Railways. The overhead wiring was removed on 17 August 1953, and the line singled and worked as a siding from 21 March 1961.With the containerisation boom the pier became unused, being closed to public access in the early 1990s due to the poor timber condition. Squatters caused a fire in the late 1990s that destroyed the store structures. In the three years to 2004, 14 fires occurred. A refurbishment, estimated to cost $14 million, was announced by the State Government in April 2006, with the first 196 metres of the pier to be fully restored. Beyond that point, the decking was removed and the original pylons preserved. A full restoration was estimated to cost $60 million. A contract for the work was awarded in June 2007,  and work began in October of the same year. The refurbished section of the pier reopened to the public in December 2011.\n\n\n== References =="

This created a desperate need for black housing in the city, so home builders worked with the Dallas Negro Chamber of Commerce (today the Dallas Black Chamber of Commerce) to stir up activism to get developments built.The largest proposal was a 3,000 acres (12 km2) community along the Trinity River, 5.5 miles (8.9 km) northwest of downtown that blacks ultimately rejected due to its proximity to the \"riverbottom.\"  In May 1949, Karl Hoblitzelle encouraged trustees of his charitable foundation to contribute to the cause. In 1953, the group donated US$216,872.93 to the Dallas Citizens' Interracial Association to purchase a 233 acres (0.94 km2) site for Hamilton Park. In addition, the group borrowed $423,619.99 from three Dallas banks to finance infrastructure.The neighborhood was dedicated in October 1953, opened in May 1954, and was complete by 1961. It contained a shopping center, a park, a twelve-grade school (later made six-grade), 742 single-family homes and an apartment complex. The school built in the neighborhood (now known as Hamilton Park Pacesetter Magnet) was originally segregated, but this ended in 1975 when the school started the Pacesetter program and parents of non-black children sent their kids to the school.Hamilton Park's prime location is at the SE portion of what is now the High Five Interchange or the intersection of North Central Expressway (US 75) and I-635 attracted interested in 1985 \u2014 that year, a developer proposed to purchase part or all of Hamilton Park for high-rise buildings but residents opposed the proposal and it fell through."

        "content": "Linfield traces its history back to the earliest days of Oregon Territory, when pioneer Baptists in Oregon City created the Oregon Baptist Educational Society in 1848. This society was organized to establish a Baptist school in the region, which began as Oregon City College in 1849. In 1855, Sebastian C. Adams began to agitate for a school in McMinnville. Adams and his associates were members of the Christian Church, and so the school became a Christian School. To begin, 6 acres (2.4 ha) of property were donated by W. T. Newby and a group was formed to establish the school. The group included William Dawson, James McBride,  Newby, and Adams, and they bore the major part of the expenses of starting the school. These men built a building and convinced Adams, who was a teacher, to operate the school.  After about a year and a half and because of the difficulty of running the school alone and funding problems, Adams suggested that the school be turned over to the Baptists who were attempting to start up the West Union Institute that had been chartered in 1858 by the Oregon Territorial Legislature. The Adams group imposed the condition that the Baptists keep at least one professor employed continuously in the college department. Other accounts indicate that the Baptist group purchased the land in 1857 in order to start their school.\nThe Oregon Territorial Legislature chartered the Baptist College at McMinnville in 1858.  The school later became McMinnville College in 1898.\nIn 1922, the name was changed to Linfield College in memory of a Baptist minister, the Rev. George Fisher Linfield whose widow, Frances Eleanor Ross Linfield, gave a substantial donation to the college to promote Christian education and as a memorial to her late husband.  Mrs. Linfield served as Dean of Women from 1921 to 1928, and sat on the Board of Directors from 1922 to her death in 1940.  Her gift included real estate in Spokane, Washington, valued at $250,000 (a sum worth nearly $4 million in 2020).  In his 1938 book, Bricks Without Straw: The Story of Linfield College, Professor Jonas A. \"Steine\" Jonasson quotes from the minutes of the college's board of trustees to explain Mrs. Linfield's motivation for her large land gift to the college: \"Mrs. Linfield's dual purpose in making the gift to McMinnville College was to 'perpetuate the name, scholarly attainments and Christian influence of her late husband, Rev. George Fisher Linfield, and to promote the cause of Christian education.'\"The Linfield Division of Continuing Education (an Adult Degree Program) began in 1975. Today it serves eight communities in Oregon as well as online degree programs giving working adults the opportunity to complete a bachelor's degree or certificate program.\nIn 1982, the Linfield College-Portland Campus was established when the college entered into an affiliation with Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital & Medical Center and began offering a bachelor's degree program in nursing.\nLinfield offered buyouts to 13 professors in liberal-arts programs with shrinking enrollment in 2019, shortly after President Miles K. Davis arrived. He also announced efforts to shift resources to the nursing and business programs, which account for the majority of students. Those shifts led to strained relationships with some faculty members in the traditional liberals arts disciplines.The school officially changed its name to Linfield University, effective on July 1, 2020.\nIn November, 2023, Davis announced his intention to resign in early 2024. Rebecca Johnson was appointed interim president on December 26, 2023."

Smith led a young, enthusiastic staff at this location for six years. He was especially proud of a multi-media presentation chronicling the invention and refinement of the bicycle; it was then the only world-class history of the bicycle on exhibit in the United States. The museum's halls featured rotating exhibits of automobiles, motorcycles, carriages, and bicycles. The museum's collection of antique-auto newsreel footage broadened into a library of vintage movie comedies, displaying vehicles of the 1920s in motion. Museum visitors had the opportunity to see high-wheeled-bicycle demonstrations, and ride in a vintage-1937 fire engine named for Boston Pops conductor and firefighting-memorabilia enthusiast Arthur Fiedler.\nThe Museum of Transportation at Larz Anderson Park closed on December 31, 1977, and effected a partnership with The Children's Museum of Boston. The museum reopened in 1979, sharing space with The Children's Museum at Museum Wharf in downtown Boston, but the joint venture was short-lived and the antique-auto contingent returned to its Anderson Park home in the 1980s.\nSince then the museum continues to showcase exceptional examples of vintage motor vehicles. While maintaining the most precious \"gems\" of the original Larz Anderson Auto Collection, the museum no longer has the following: 1905 Walter Tractor & Victoria Carriage, 1907 Walter Brougham, 1910 American Underslung (designed by Harry Stutz), 1913 Hudson 33, 1917 Ford Model T Estate Wagon, 1918 Dodge, 1920 Dodge Truck, 1920 Dodge Hackney, 1924 Dodge Sedan, 1928 Nash Advanced Six, 1930 Packard Limousine, 1931 REO Flying Cloud 6-21, 1936 Dodge Station Wagon, 1938 Dodge Express Truck, 1939 GMC Truck, 1940 Ford Deluxe Wagon, 1941 Packard Suburban, 1947 Pontiac Sedan and the 1948 Ford Super Deluxe Wagon."

        "content": "The Embargo Act of 1807 was a general trade embargo on all foreign nations that was enacted by the United States Congress. As a successor or replacement law for the 1806 Non-importation Act and passed as the Napoleonic Wars continued, it represented an escalation of attempts to persuade Britain to stop any impressment of American sailors and to respect American sovereignty and neutrality but also attempted to pressure France and other nations in the pursuit of general diplomatic and economic leverage.\nIn the first decade of the 19th century, American shipping grew. During the Napoleonic Wars, rival nations Britain and France targeted neutral American shipping as a means to disrupt the trade of the other nation. American merchantmen who were trading with \"enemy nations\" were seized as contraband of war by European navies. The British Royal Navy had impressed American sailors who had either been British-born or previously serving on British ships, even if they now claimed to be American citizens with American papers. Incidents such as the Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair outraged Americans.\nCongress imposed the embargo in direct response to these events. President Thomas Jefferson acted with restraint, weighed public support for retaliation, and recognized that the United States was militarily far weaker than either Britain or France. He recommended that Congress respond with commercial warfare, a policy that appealed to Jefferson both for being experimental and for foreseeably harming his domestic political opponents more than his allies, whatever its effect on the European belligerents. The 10th Congress was controlled by his allies and agreed to the Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 1807.\nIn terms of diplomacy, the Embargo failed to improve the American diplomatic position, and sharply increased international political tensions. Both widespread evasion of the embargo and loopholes in the legislation reduced its impact on its targets. British commercial shipping, which already dominated global trade, was successfully adapting to Napoleon's Continental System by pursuing new markets, particularly in the restive Spanish and  Portuguese colonies in South America. Thus, British merchants were well-positioned to grow at American expense when the embargo sharply reduced American trade activity.\nThe Act's prohibition on imports stimulated the growth of nascent US domestic industries across the board, particularly the textile industry, and marked the beginning of the manufacturing system in the United States, reducing the nation's dependence upon imported manufactured goods.Americans opposed to the Act launched bitter protests, particularly in New England commercial centers. Support for the declining Federalist Party, which intensely opposed Jefferson, temporarily rebounded and drove electoral gains in 1808 (Senate and House). On  March 1, 1809, the Replacement legislation for the embargo was enacted during the last days of Jefferson's presidency. Tensions with Britain continued to grow and eventually led to the War of 1812."

        "content": "After the short truce in 1802\u20131803, the European wars resumed and continued until the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814. The war caused American relations with both Britain and France to deteriorate rapidly. There was grave risk of war with one or the other. With Britain supreme on the sea and France on the land, the war developed into a struggle of blockade and counterblockade. The commercial war peaked in 1806 and 1807. Britain's Royal Navy shut down most European harbors to American ships unless they first traded through British ports. France declared a paper blockade of Britain but lacked a navy that could enforce it and seized American ships that obeyed British regulations. The Royal Navy needed large numbers of sailors, and was deeply angered at the American merchant fleet for being a haven for British deserters.\nBritish impressment of American sailors humiliated the United States, which showed it to be unable to protect its ships and their sailors. The British practice of taking British deserters, many of them now American citizens, from American ships and conscripting them into the Royal Navy increased greatly after 1803, and it caused bitter anger in the United States.\nOn June 21, 1807, an American warship, the USS Chesapeake, was boarded on the high seas off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia by a British warship, HMS Leopard. The Chesapeake had been carrying four deserters from the Royal Navy, three of them American and one British. The four deserters, who had been issued American papers, were removed from the Chesapeake and taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where the lone Briton was hanged while the three Americans were initially sentenced to 500 lashes. (American diplomatic pressure led to the return of the three Americans, without the dispensing of punishment.) The outraged nation demanded action, and President Jefferson ordered all British ships out of American waters."

The bill was drafted at the request of President Thomas Jefferson and was passed by the 10th Congress on December 22, 1807, during Session 1; Chapter 5.

In commercial New England and the Middle Atlantic, ships sat idle. In agricultural areas, particularly the South, farmers and planters could not sell crops internationally. The scarcity of European goods stimulated American manufacturing, particularly in the North, and textile manufacturers began to make massive investments in cotton mills. However, as Britain still able to export to America particularly through Canada, that benefit did not immediately compensate for present loss of trade and economic momentum. A 2005 study by the economic historian Douglas Irwin estimates that the embargo cost about 5% of America's 1807 gross national product.Miniature engraved teapots were manufactured to bolster flagging popular support for the Embargo Act.

        "content": "A case study of Rhode Island shows the embargo to have devastated shipping-related industries, wrecked existing markets, and caused an increase in opposition to the Democratic\u2013Republican Party. Smuggling was widely endorsed by the public, which viewed the embargo as a violation of its rights. Public outcry continued and helped the Federalists regain control of the state government in 1808\u20131809. The case is a rare example of American national foreign policy altering local patterns of political allegiance.\nDespite its unpopular nature, the Embargo Act had some limited unintended benefits to the Northeast, especially by driving capital and labor into New England textile and other manufacturing industries, which lessened America's reliance on British trade.In Vermont, the embargo was doomed to failure on the Lake Champlain\u2013Richeleiu River water route because of the state's dependence on a Canadian outlet for produce. At St. John, Lower Canada, \u00a3140,000 worth of goods smuggled by water were recorded there in 1808, a 31% increase over 1807. Shipments of ashes to make soap nearly doubled to \u00a354,000, but those of lumber dropped by 23% to \u00a311,200. Manufactured goods, which had expanded to \u00a350,000 since Jay's Treaty in 1795, fell by over 20%, especially articles made near tidewater. Newspapers and manuscripts recorded more lake activity than usual, despite the theoretical reduction in shipping that should accompany an embargo.  The smuggling was not restricted to water routes, as herds were readily driven across the uncontrollable land border. Southbound commerce gained two thirds overall, but furs dropped a third. Customs officials maintained a stance of vigorous enforcement throughout, and Gallatin's Enforcement Act (1809) was a party issue. Many Vermonters preferred the embargo's exciting game of revenuers versus smugglers, which brought high profits, versus mundane, low-profit normal trade.The New England merchants who evaded the embargo were imaginative, daring, and versatile in their violation of federal law. Gordinier (2001) examines how the merchants of New London, Connecticut, organized and managed the cargoes purchased and sold and the vessels that were used during the years before, during, and after the embargo. Trade routes and cargoes, both foreign and domestic, along with the vessel types, and the ways that their ownership and management were organized show the merchants of southeastern Connecticut evinced versatility in the face of crisis.Gordinier (2001) concludes that the versatile merchants sought alternative strategies for their commerce and, to a lesser extent, for their navigation. They tried extralegal activities, a reduction in the size of the foreign fleet, and the redocumentation of foreign trading vessels into domestic carriage. Most importantly, they sought new domestic trading partners and took advantage of the political power of Jedidiah Huntington, the Customs Collector. Huntington was an influential member of the Connecticut leadership class (called \"the Standing Order\") and allowed scores of embargoed vessels to depart for foreign ports under the guise of \"special permission\". Old modes of sharing vessel ownership to share the risk proved to be difficult to modify. Instead, established relationships continued through the embargo crisis despite numerous bankruptcies."

Britain, expecting to suffer most from the American regulations, built up a new South American market for its exports, and the British shipowners were pleased that American competition had been removed by the action of the US government.  \nJefferson placed himself in a strange position with his embargo policy. Though he had frequently argued for as little government intervention as possible, he now found himself assuming extraordinary powers in an attempt to enforce his policy. The presidential election of 1808 had James Madison defeat Charles Cotesworth Pinckney but showed that the Federalists were regaining strength and helped to convince Jefferson and Madison that the embargo should end. Shortly before leaving office in March 1809, Jefferson signed the repeal of the embargo. \nDespite its unpopular nature, the Embargo Act had one longterm positive impact.  Unfulfilled domestic demand for manufactured goods stimulated the growth of the Industrial Revolution in the United States, resulting in an emerging American domestic manufacturing system."

After existing embargoes expired with the onset of war, the Embargo Act of 1813 was signed into law December 17, 1813. Four new restrictions were included: an embargo prohibiting all American ships and goods from leaving port, a complete ban on certain commodities customarily produced in the British Empire, a ban against foreign ships trading in American ports unless 75% of the crew were citizens of the ship's flag, and a ban on ransoming ships. The Embargo of 1813 was the nation's last great trade restriction. Never again would the US government cut off all trade to achieve a foreign policy objective. The Act particularly hurt the Northeast since the British kept a tighter blockade on the South and thus encouraged American opposition to the administration. To make his point, the Act was not lifted by Madison until after the defeat of Napoleon, and the point was moot.\nOn February 15, 1815, Madison signed the Enemy Trade Act of 1815, which was tighter than any previous trade restriction including the Enforcement Act of 1809 (January 9) and the Embargo of 1813, but it would expire two weeks later when official word of peace from Ghent was received."

The southern end was at the present day Lombard Street at what was called Uhler's Spring Branch.  The road was being referred to as Charles Street by at least 1761. In 1858, the Jones Falls flooded and overflowed. The bridge along Charles Street (near present-day Penn Station) was swept away.The first portion of what was known as Charles Street Avenue to be paved in Baltimore County was west of the center of Towson, from Chesapeake Avenue north to Joppa Road, by 1915. The remainder of the highway in Baltimore County was paved in 1928 and marked as MD 139 by 1933. By 1934, traffic levels were high enough on the highway that the Maryland State Roads Commission recommended widening the road in Baltimore County from 14 to 20 feet (4.3 to 6.1 m) to 30 feet (9.1 m) in width. Within Baltimore, MD 139 was split into a one-way pair between North Avenue and 29th Street, with northbound following Charles Street and southbound using Maryland Avenue, by 1950.In 1954, a project began to widen MD 139 from the Baltimore city line north to MD 134. In addition, preliminary work began at the site of the highway's future interchange with I-695 that year and actual construction began in 1955. Starting in 1956, MD 139 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from MD 134 to the modern intersection with Towsontown Boulevard and relocated as a four-lane divided highway from there to the Beltway interchange. Construction was completed from the Beltway interchange south to Joppa Road and from MD 134 to Towsontown Boulevard in 1957. The relocation project, including Joppa Road's bridge over MD 139, was completed in 1958. The bypass was marked as MD 139 by 1959 and the old segment of Charles Street Avenue was transferred to county maintenance by 1961. In 1963, the southbound direction of the state highway was assigned to St. Paul Street from North Avenue to the street's northern end at Charles Street; the street was a two-way divided boulevard north of 33rd Street.The intersection with Bellona Avenue at the state highway's northern terminus in Lutherville was replaced with a roundabout in 1999. This roundabout was later removed and replaced with a standard intersection as part of reconstruction of MD 139 and I-695 around their interchange that started in 2008."

The park covers one city block, bounded by Main, Capitol, Walnut, and Washington Streets.The park was renamed \"Confederate Park\" in 1923, at request of United Daughters of the Confederacy.The park contains several historic structures, including a Victorian-era gazebo near the corner of Walnut Avenue and Washington Street, the Demopolis City Hall, built in 1869\u201370 as a courthouse annex, and the old Presbyterian Church, built in 1843 and now known as Rooster Hall.  The former church served as the Marengo County Courthouse from 1868 until 1871, when the county seat was temporarily moved from Linden. The park's center features a large cast iron fountain that was installed in 1895. The park is often used for the city's festivals, most notably for many of the Christmas on the River events.  The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 29 November 1975.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "On 5 August 1824, the whaler Ph\u0153nix of London (master John Palmer) in the company of whaler Mary of London, came to a low and barren island with a spacious lagoon, in latitude 2\u00b0 48\u02b9 S and longitude 172\u00b0 10\u02b9 W, and it was named \"Mary Ballcotts Island\". H.E. Maude and Niel Gunson both assumed this to be the whaler Mary, owned by John Lydekker (1778\u20131832), and that her captain Edward Reed Lacy had reported the island. The entry for 5 August 1824 of that Mary's logbook, however, mentions no discovery, nor a ship Ph\u0153nix. The ship Mary truly there that day (her master presumably Abijah Lock) was another whaler from London, owned by Hill, Boulcott & Hill, a firm consisting of the two brothers James & Amon Hill and their brother-in-law John Ellerker Boulcott. The latter was married to a Mary Boulcott, n\u00e9e Hill, and it was she for whom this island was named. Ever since it was incorrectly penned down as \"Mary Ballcotts Island\" in William Dalton's journal, it has appeared with deviated spelling in books and on charts as Mary-Bulrock, Mary Balcout, Marie Ballcout, etc.Modern Canton derives its name from the New Bedford whaler Canton, which was wrecked on its outer shore in early March 1854. Captain Andrew Johnson Wing (1820\u20131897) and his full crew managed to save not only themselves but also four small whaleboats and scanty provisions. In late March, the 31 men tried their luck by putting to sea in the four open boats and made their way northwest for 49 days straight when finally they reached safety in Guam, 2,900 nautical miles from where they had started. Kanton is spelled with a K in the Gilbertese language, which has no letter C. The two versions of the name exist in the Constitution of 1979."

The first secessions in 1841 took place in Michigan although the new church group was formalized in Utica, New York. In November 1842, Orange Scott, La Roy Sunderland and J. Horton seceded from the Methodist Episcopal Church for reasons given in their publication of the True Wesleyan. The first general conference was held in Utica, NY, in October 1844.\nThe Wesleyan Methodist Church fell into the category of Holiness Methodist Pacifists, as it opposed war as documented in its Book of Disciplines, which stated that the Gospel is in \"every way opposed to the practice of War in all its forms; and those customs which tend to foster and perpetuate war spirit, [are] inconsistent with the benevolent designs of the Christian religion.\"  They also cited tolerance of the Methodist Episcopal Church of \"so horrible a crime\" as slavery as a reason for their secession.The Wesleyan Methodist Church merged with the Pilgrim Holiness Church in 1968, and became known as The Wesleyan Church. This was largely driven by the trend toward denominational mergers during the 1960s and the belief their similarities were greater than their differences.  As such, they believed they could be more effective becoming one group. Several conferences in both merging denominations refused to be a part of the merged church over differences about modesty and worldliness (some of the conferences did not permit their members to have television sets, and required the women to have uncut hair in keeping with their interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11:15). One of the largest conferences which refused to join the merger was the Allegheny Conference with over 100 churches. It became the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection of Churches, and most of the churches are still known as Wesleyan Methodist, e.g. Salem Wesleyan Methodist Church. Other Wesleyan Methodists who dissented with the merger organized into the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches and the Bible Methodist Connection of Tennessee."

        "content": "The Francization of Brussels refers to the evolution, over the past two centuries, of this historically Dutch-speaking city into one where French has become the majority language and lingua franca. The main cause of this transition was the rapid, compulsory assimilation of the Flemish population, amplified by immigration from France and Wallonia.The rise of French in public life gradually began by the end of the 18th century, quickly accelerating as the new capital saw a major increase in population following Belgian independence. Dutch \u2014 of which standardization in Belgium was still very weak \u2014 could not compete with French, which was the exclusive language of the judiciary, the administration, the army, education, high culture and the media. The value and prestige of the French language was so universally acknowledged that after 1880, and more particularly after the turn of the century, proficiency in French among Dutch-speakers increased spectacularly.Although the majority of the population remained bilingual until the second half of the 20th century, the original Brabantian dialect was often no longer passed on from one generation to another, leading to an increase of monolingual French-speakers from 1910 onwards. This language shift weakened after the 1960s, as the language border was fixed, the status of Dutch as an official language was confirmed, and the economic center of gravity shifted northward to Flanders.However, with the continuing arrival of immigrants (most either from French-speaking countries or more familiar with French) and the post-war emergence of Brussels as a center of international politics, the relative position of Dutch continued to decline. Simultaneously, as Brussels' urban area expanded, a further number of Dutch-speaking municipalities in the Brussels periphery also became predominantly French-speaking. This phenomenon of expanding Francization (dubbed the \"oil slick\" by its opponents), remains, together with the future of Brussels, one of the most controversial topics in Belgian politics and public discourse."

        "content": "Brussels attracted many immigrants from Flanders, where economic strife and hunger were widespread in the 1840s. Native Flemish Brussels residents harboured a sense of superiority over the other Flemish immigrants from the poor countryside, which manifested itself in the decision to speak the \"superior\" French language.In two or three generations, the new immigrants themselves began to speak French. A typical family might have Dutch-speaking grandparents, bilingual parents, and French-speaking children. The exclusively French educational system played an important role in this changing language landscape. Dutch was mainly ignored as a school subject. From 1842, Dutch was removed from the first four years of boys' schools, although in later school grades, it could be studied. In girls' schools and Catholic schools, Dutch was taught even less, even though Dutch was still the native tongue of a majority of the students.Just after the mayoral inauguration of Charles Buls in 1881, elementary schools that taught Dutch were reopened in 1883. In these schools, the first two years of lessons were given in Dutch, soon after which students transitioned into French-speaking classes. The proposal by Buls was initially poorly received by the local councils, although they were later accepted when studies showed that when students had acquired a good understanding of Dutch, they more easily obtained French speaking skills. The dominance of French in education was not affected, since most schooling in later years was still in French. Because of the authoritative position that French enjoyed in Belgium and the misconceptions of Buls' plan, many Flemish children were still sent to a French school in order to better master the language. This was made possible by the idea of \"freedom of the head of household\", which stipulated that parents were allowed to send their children to any school they wished, regardless of the child's mother tongue. Since most pupils were sent to French schools rather than Dutch schools, after the end of World War I there was not a single Dutch class left in central Brussels. In the thirteen municipalities that constituted the Brussels metropolitan area, there were 441 Dutch classes and 1,592 French classes, even though the French-speaking population made up just under one-third of the total.As a result of the propagation of the bilingual education system, Dutch was no longer being passed down by many Flemish parents to their children. French was beginning to be increasingly used as the main language spoken at home by many Flemings. In Flanders, education played less of a role in Francization because most schools continued to teach in Dutch."

The first wave came in 1815 bringing Jacobins and Bonapartists; a second wave came in 1848 bringing French republicans and Orl\u00e9anists, a third came after the 1851 French coup d'\u00e9tat, and a fourth came in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War. Asylum seekers and other immigrants also came from other parts of Europe such as Italy, Poland, Germany, and Russia. They preferred to speak French rather than Dutch when they arrived, which further intensified Francization.As the capital of the new kingdom, Brussels also attracted a large number of Walloon migrants. In contrast to Flemish citizens of Brussels, who came primarily from the lower social classes, the Walloon newcomers belonged mainly to the middle class. The Walloon and French migrants lived predominantly in the Marollen district of Brussels, where Marols, a mixture of Brabantian Dutch, French, and Walloon, was spoken. Despite the fact that many lower-class Walloons also made their way to Brussels, the perception of French as an intellectual and elite language did not change. Additionally, Brussels received a considerable number of French-speaking members of the Flemish bourgeoisie.Between 1830 and 1875 the population of the City of Brussels grew from approximately 100,000 to 180,000; the population of the metropolitan area soared to 750,000 by 1910."

        "content": "In contrast to the rest of Flanders, French in Brussels was seen less as a means of oppression but rather as a tool for social progress. In the first decade after the independence of Belgium, the neglect of the Dutch language and culture gradually caused increasingly greater dissatisfaction in the Flemish community. In 1856, the \"Grievances Commission\" was established to investigate the problems of the Flemings. It was devoted to making the administration, military, educational system and judicial system bilingual, but was politically ignored. Another group to decry the problems of the Flemings was \"Vlamingen Vooruit\" (\"Flemings Forward\"), founded in 1858 in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode.  Members included Charles Buls, mayor of Brussels, and L\u00e9on Vanderkindere, mayor of Uccle.  Although Brussels was 57% Dutch-speaking in 1880, Flemish primary schools were prohibited until 1883. In 1884, the municipal government decided to allow birth, death, and marriage certificates to be written in Dutch.  However, only a tenth of the population made use of these opportunities, suggesting that in the minds of Brussels' inhabitants, French was the normal way of conducting these matters. In 1889, Dutch was once again allowed in courtrooms, but only for use in oral testimony.In the late 19th century, the Flemish movement gained even more strength and demanded Belgium be made bilingual. This proposal was rejected by French speakers, who feared a \"Flemishization\" of Wallonia as well as the prospect of having to learn Dutch in order to obtain a job in the civil service. The Flemings adapted their goals to the realities of the situation and devoted themselves to a monolingual Flanders, which Brussels was still socially a part of.  The Flemings hoped to limit the spread of French in Flanders by restricting the areas in which French was an official language. In 1873 in the Sint-Jans-Molenbeek district of Brussels, Flemish labourer Jozef Schoep refused to accept a French-language birth certificate. He was ordered to pay a fine of 50 francs. His case generated considerable controversy and shortly thereafter the Coremans Law was introduced, which allowed Dutch to be used by Dutch speakers in court.In general, the Flemish movement in Brussels did not garner much support for its plans regarding the use of Dutch. Each attempt to promote Dutch and limit the expansion of French influence as a symbol of social status was seen as a means to stifle social mobility rather than as a protective measure as it was seen in the rest of Flanders.  Whereas in other Flemish cities such as Ghent in which the Flemish labourers were dominated by a French-speaking upper class, in Brussels it was not as easy to make such a distinction because so many Walloons made up a large portion of the working class. The linguistic heterogeneity, combined with the fact that most of the workers' upper class spoke French, meant that the class struggle for most workers in Brussels was not seen as a language struggle as well. Ever since the start of the 20th century, the workers' movement in Brussels defended bilingualism, so as to have a means of emancipation for the local working class. This, along with the educational system, facilitated the Francization of thousands of Brussels residents."

From that point forward, in the provinces of Limburg, Antwerp, West Flanders and East Flanders, and in the arrondissement of Leuven, all public communication was given in Dutch or in both languages. For the arrondissement of Brussels, documents could be requested in Dutch. Nonetheless, by 1900 most large Flemish cities, cities along the language border, and the municipalities of the Brussels metropolitan area were still administered in French.In 1921, the territoriality principle was recognized, which solidified the outline of the Belgian language border.  The Flemings hoped that such a language border would help to curb the influx of French in Flanders. Belgium became divided into three language areas: a monolingual Dutch-speaking area in the north (Flanders), a monolingual French-speaking area in the south (Wallonia), and a bilingual area (Brussels), even though the majority of Brussels residents spoke primarily Dutch. The municipalities in the Brussels metropolitan region, the bilingual region of Belgium, could freely choose either language to be used in administrative purposes. The town government of Sint-Stevens-Woluwe, which lies in present-day Flemish Brabant, was the only one to opt for Dutch over French."

Dutch was made an official language within the central government, the (then) four Flemish provinces, as well as the arrondissements of Leuven and Brussels (excepting the Brussels metropolitan area as a whole). The law also stipulated that municipalities on the language border or near Brussels would be required to provide services in both languages when the minority exceeded 30%, and the administrative language of a municipality would be changed if the language minority grew to greater than 50%.  This was to be regulated by a language census every ten years, although the validity of the results from Flanders was frequently questioned.  In 1932, Sint-Stevens-Woluwe, now a part of the Zaventem municipality, became the first municipality in Belgian history to secede from the bilingual Brussels metro region because the French-speaking minority percentage fell to below 30%. This did not sit well with some French speakers in Brussels, some of whom formed a group called the \"Ligue contre la flamandisation de Bruxelles\" (League against the Flemishification of Brussels), which campaigned against what they saw as a form of \"Flemish tyranny\". Before the introduction of French as an official language of Ganshoren and Sint-Agatha-Berchem, the group also objected to the bilingual status of Ixelles. The group also strongly defended the \"freedom of the head of household\", a major factor in the process of Francization."

Various municipalities shifted from one language area to another, such as Voeren, which became part of Flanders, and Comines-Warneton and Mouscron which became part of Wallonia. In both Wezembeek-Oppem and Sint-Genesius-Rode, language facilities were established for French speakers, who made up just under 30% of the population when the last language census in 1947 was taken.  Brussels was fixed at 19 municipalities, thus creating a bilingual enclave in otherwise monolingual Flanders.Brussels was limited to the current 19 municipalities. Many French speakers complained that this did not correspond to the social reality, since the language border was based on the results of the 1947 language census and not that of 1960. French-speaking sources claim that in that year, French-speaking minorities had surpassed the 30% threshold in Alsemberg, Beersel, Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Dilbeek, Strombeek-Bever, Sterrebeek, and Sint-Stevens-Woluwe, in which case French-language facilities should have been established under previous legislation. A political rift developed because French speakers considered the language facilities as an essential right, while the Flemings saw the facilities as a temporary, transitional measure to allow the French-speaking minorities time to adapt to their Flemish surroundings.The division of the country into language areas had serious consequences for education, and the \"freedom of the head of household\" was abolished. Thence, Dutch-speaking children were required to be educated in Dutch and French-speaking children in French. This stemmed the tide of further Francization of Brussels. Some of the more radical French speakers such as the Democratic Front of Francophones were opposed to this change and advocated the restoration of the freedom of education."

They demanded free choice of language in the educational system, the freedom for the Brussels metropolitan area to grow beyond the language border and into the unilingual Flanders, and economic opportunities for the metropolitan area that would later comprise the Brussels-Capital Region. The Front accepted that governmental agencies in Brussels would be bilingual, but not that every civil servant working in those agencies be bilingual. The party experienced growing popularity and saw electoral success in the elections of the 1960s and 1970s.The FDF objected to a fixed representation of the language groups in the agencies, considering this to be undemocratic. In the predecessor to the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region, for example, a significant number of seats were reserved for Dutch speakers. A number of French speakers circumvented this by claiming to be Dutch speakers, and over a third of the seats reserved for Dutch speakers were taken by these so-called \"false Flemish\".With the fusion of Belgian municipalities in 1976, some primarily French-speaking municipalities joined larger municipalities with Flemish majorities, thereby reducing the number of French-speaking municipalities.Zellik joined Asse, Sint-Stevens-Woluwe and Sterrebeek joined Zaventem, and Strombeek-Bever joined Grimbergen. In addition, several larger municipalities with mostly Flemish populations were created, such as Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Dilbeek, Beersel and Tervuren.

However, by that time, efforts were being made to extend the railway to the entire length of the original line from Lakeside through to Gembrook. Wright was officially re-opened on 18 October 1998, but a replica of the original shed was not rebuilt until sometime later.\nTrains do not normally stop at Wright."

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for its architectural significance.Attorneys for the construction, plumbing and electrical companies that had previously won a court judgment for unpaid work at the museum joined to purchase the property for $1.3 million: the total amount a judge found that they are owed. The group was the sole bidder at the public auction.\nBeginning in 2008, the Minnesota African American Museum and Cultural Center occupied the structure. The museum began a $6 million fundraising effort to renovate it. Although the museum spent several million dollars on improvements, its fundraising effort failed to cover the cost of renovations. Creditors won a lawsuit in September 2015 evicting the museum. The creditors now jointly own the property. In 2016, the property and adjoining carriage house were divided into 9 apartments."

The Land Run of 1893 led to the addition of Kay, Grant, Woods, Garfield, Noble, and Pawnee counties.

Surrounded by high mountains, it is roughly 15 miles due north of the city, which makes this mountain the most popular climb in Bolivia. The normal ascent route is a fairly straightforward glacier climb, with some crevasses and a steep climb to the summit. However, the other side of the mountain\u2014Huayna Potos\u00ed West Face\u2014is the biggest face in Bolivia. Several difficult snow and ice routes ascend this 1,000-meter-high face.\nThe first ascent of the normal route was undertaken in 1919 by Germans Rudolf Dienst and Adolf Schulze. Some climbing books report this mountain as the \"easiest 6,000er in the world\", but this claim is debatable. The easiest route entails an exposed ridge and sections of moderately steep ice, with a UIAA rating of PD. There are many 6,000 m mountains that are easier to climb in terms of technical difficulty. Perhaps therefore, the main reason Huayna Potos\u00ed has been referred to as the easiest 6,000 m climb is that the elevation gain from trailhead to summit is less than 1,400 m; with easy access from La Paz. Since La Paz is at 3,640 m, climbers have an easier time acclimatizing."

        "content": "In 1877 a group of six German climbers tried to climb Huayna Potos\u00ed for the first time. Without proper equipment and with little practical information, they set off toward the unclimbed peak. Their unsuccessful attempt met with tragedy. Four climbers died at an altitude around 5,600 m; the remaining two managed to retreat in deteriorating conditions, but died by exhaustion just after finding their way to the Zongo Pass. 21 years later, on 9 September 1898, an expedition of Austrian climbers attempted the mountain ascension again but after five days spent at 5,900 m they were forced to descend. Finally, in 1919 the Germans R. Dienst and O. Lhose reached the south summit (marginally higher than the north summit) climbing the mountain on the east face on a route that later would become the current normal route, with some variants."

        "content": "The normal route to climb Huayna Potos\u00ed is a straightforward climb on glacier. Following this route the mountain can be climbed in two daily stages. Climbers generally take a 4\u00d74 up the valley on a gravel road from El Alto taking about two hours to reach a car park at 4,700 m, Zongo Pass (16\u00b017\u203215\u2033S 68\u00b007\u203247.6\u2033W). Where a base camp is established. There is a recently established hut here. Staff are usually happy to book walk ins if they have rooms available, and a reduced price can be negotiated outside of the peak season.\nFrom the hut here it is a 1\u20133 hour hike up to the high camp at 5,200 m (16\u00b016\u203232\u2033S 68\u00b008\u203216.6\u2033W) on the snow line (Time taken depends greatly on acclimatization and fitness). This camp is called locally Campo Argentino and consists of a number of areas of leveled rocks suitable for pitching tents. As of 2006, there is a refuge at the high camp where it is possible to stay the night for around $10. Booking is preferable, and essential during peak season. Conditions are spartan, with all sleeping mattresses placed next to each other on the upper level in two rows.\nMost climbers begin their summit attempt between midnight and 3 am. Fit and well acclimatized climbers rise and leave later, overtaking other groups during the climb, and can reach the summit in around 3\u20134 hours, but people frequently take twice that time. The route is usually very clearly visible between the penitentes, and follows the main glacier up directly (across the bergschrund and directly up a ridge) or along an ar\u00eate on the right. Following that it curves behind the mountain when viewed from Zongo pass. The final approach is fairly exposed, either directly to the summit, or along the summit ridge. The summit is small and frequently has a pronounced cornice, reducing usable space.\nThe entire climb from the high camp take between 8 and 12 hours. Very acclimatised parties climb the mountain directly from the hut at Zongo Pass and in this case the whole climb takes the most of the day.\nMorning sunshine causes the snow to become less stable for walking, and increases avalanche risk from 8 am onwards. The views on a clear morning from the summit are unbelievable \u2013 the mountain is far higher than anything else anywhere nearby, and the Cordillera Real, Lake Titicaca, La Paz, and part of the Altiplano they reside on are all visible. Until early 2004 there was a guest book for summitting climbers to sign. Unfortunately this overhang collapsed in mid-2006 leaving the original metal container protruding out of the summit ridge hanging above the city of La Paz below."

Besides, a heavy marble sarcophagus was discovered, most probably especially prepared for a distinguished person of high economical, social and political status. Nonetheless, archaeological investigations identified several dwellings, and in particular a distinguished discovery of a floor mosaic composed with geometrical motifs, at the central part of the mosaic, the figural display panel of the Orpheus, makes this mosaic a special discovery. A special finding discovered at this site, is a gold wedding ring with a cameo which clearly indicates shaking of the right hands, which means an agreement but also symbolizes loyalty and friendship. \nGeophysical, geomagnetic surveys or prospection\u2019s conducted at this locality in 2008 and 2011, in an area of at least 11 hectares of this important archaeological site, identified traces of remains of different objects that at the first impression, resemble to a military field garrison, most probably stationed there to protect the surrounding area and the road station.

The collections in the former galleries of comparative anatomy (founded by Georges Cuvier in 1802 and constituted by bones, skeletons and preserved organs) were running out of room in the 1880s and 1890s and the inauguration of the Gallery of Zoology (mainly constituted by stuffed animals) encouraged this project, proposed by professors Albert Gaudry (Professor of Paleontology), Georges Pouchet (Professor of Comparative Anatomy) and Armand de Quatrefages (Professor of Anthropology), who wished to preserve and present to the public collections of great historic and scientific importance. In addition, two approaching events led to make concrete the project: the first centennial of the French National Museum of Natural History (1793-1893) and the  Exposition Universelle de Paris of 1900. In 1892 the Mus\u00e9um national D'Histoire Naturelle appointed the French architect Ferdinand Dutert to design the building and produce the drawing plans, and the works were launched in 1893, lasting until 1898. After that, the collections in the former building (Galleries of Comparative Anatomy, founded by Cuvier in 1802, and Gallery of Anthropology, founded by Quatrefages in 1855) were transferred to the new building, which was inaugurated on 21 July 1898. Even in the present day, the collections derive from the great expeditions of the traveller-naturalists of the 18th and 19th centuries as well as from the m\u00e9nagerie du Jardin des plantes (one of the oldest zoos in the world).\nThe remarkable Gallery building, designed by the architect Ferdinand Dutert consists of two floors which are sorted in three levels (ground floor, first floor and second floor) and its surface area is approximately 2,500 square metres (27,000 sq ft). The gallery, made of stone and metal, is almost 80 metres (260 ft) long, the facades are decorated with sculptures inspired by naturalists and large windows afford abundant natural light. Originally, the second floor (two rooms and the mezzanine over the first floor) was occupied by the Anthropology collections, but in 1937 these collections migrated to the new mus\u00e9e de l'Homme. Since then the second floor displays the fossil invertebrates and, in addition, and since the early 2010s, the fossil plants."

        "content": "The Bank Street Historic District is a group of four attached brick commercial buildings in different architectural styles on that street in Waterbury, Connecticut, United States. They were built over a 20-year period around the end of the 19th century, when Waterbury was a prosperous, growing industrial center. In 1983 they were recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nAmong the four is a rare Queen Anne Style commercial building, and one of the only three Richardsonian Romanesque commercial buildings in the city. Some of Waterbury's leading architects of the time were among the designers. The four have remained intact even as later, modern development interceded between them and the contemporary buildings elsewhere downtown."

This is on the east side of Bank between Grand Street and the Interstate 84 viaduct. The terrain slopes slightly to the south.The neighborhood is densely developed and urban. A large modern commercial block is across the street. Driveways on the north and south give access to parking lots behind the buildings and separate the row from other modern buildings.At the ends of the block small rows of trees buffer both Grand and the interstate. To the northeast is a small park at Grand and South Main Street. The Bank and Grand intersection is the southeast corner of the much larger Downtown Waterbury Historic District, with a concentration of buildings from the same era as the Bank Street buildings. A block to the west are the five public and private buildings, including City Hall, originally designed by Cass Gilbert as the Waterbury Municipal Center Complex.All four buildings are at least four stories high. Three are faced in brick, and one in brownstone, with glass storefronts at street level. Small trees are planted at intervals along with sidewalk. They are all considered contributing properties."

        "content": "In the 1880s Bank Street south of Grand was undeveloped, a de facto buffer between the industrial areas to the south and the commercial and civic core of downtown to the north. Some of Waterbury's wealthier citizens owned the lots, intending to build large houses. The city's growth made them realize that downtown would continue to expand and that the lots would be better developed as commercial property. They built houses instead in the Hill neighborhood.Henry C. Griggs, cofounder of the Smith and Griggs Manufacturing Company and a two-term member of the Connecticut General Assembly, which made small items like corset fasteners from the brass the city produced in great abundance, sold part of his lot to Republican editor J. Henry Morrow in 1883. Morrow built the building, the first of the four now in the district, to accommodate not only the paper's printing presses and editorial offices but its printing business. Stylistically it reflects different influences of the time. The corbelling and terra cotta panels are typical Victorian decorations, while the fanlight and fenestration anticipate the Colonial Revival style by a few decades.The following year Griggs developed his remaining property. He hired Robert W. Hill, a former student of Henry Austin who was one of Waterbury's most accomplished architects of the time, with many public buildings around Connecticut to his credit. Hill's building for Griggs was a rare use of the Queen Anne style in a commercial building. The varied surfaces, rich decoration and mixture of curved and rectilinear mark it as particularly high in that style.Also in 1884, the Pritchard family developed its lot to the north. They hired Joseph A. Jackson, the son of an Irish immigrant carpenter who had studied under Hill and become another of Waterbury's leading architects. The rough stone facing and round arches are typical of the Romanesque Revival style popular at the time, as interpreted by Henry Hobson Richardson.Griggs had apparently hoped the building would be among the most desirable locations in Waterbury, but he was never able to attract that kind of tenant. Shortly after it opened, the Franklin Hotel moved in from a few blocks away. At the ground level it was home to a piano tuner, photographer's studio and billiards parlor. Next door, the Republican moved out in 1896. Morrow continued to rent the building, and it eventually acquired his name.The Pritchards sold their building in 1901. John Whittemore, the new owner, was another successful Waterbury industrialist who dabbled in real estate. In 1904, he added the south wing, designed by Henry Griggs' son Walter, who by then was also a part-owner of his father's building to the south. He had become one of the city's most accomplished architects, later to build such downtown landmarks as the nearby county courthouse, the Elton Hotel and the Lilley Building, Waterbury's first steel frame commercial structure. The Georgian Revival structure he designed for his neighbor is an exemplary modest commercial effort, with its brick facing, small-pane windows and classically inspired cornice typifying a style he did not usually work in.Later a northern addition, since demolished, was built. The entire building was known and rented as the Pritchard Block. Diorio's Restaurant was established in the Republican/Morrow Building in the early 1920s. During the entire 1980s, it was closed and restored to its original appearance from that time. At the time the district was listed on the Register in the early 1980s, a billboard was on the outside of the fourth floor of the Griggs building; it has since been removed."

The company claimed that the program infringed on the Humana trademark. Humana failed to block the airing of the show, but was successful at forcing NBC into showing a disclaimer at the beginning of the September 30 episode saying that the drama had no connection whatsoever with Humana.On May 30, 1996, Linda Peeno, a physician who was contracted to work for Humana for nine months, testified before Congress as to the downside of managed care. Peeno said she was effectively rewarded by her employer for causing the death of a patient, because it saved the company a half-million dollars. Peeno stated that she felt the \"managed care\" model was inherently unethical.In 1999, season one of Michael Moore's TV series The Awful Truth reported on Humana refusing to pay for a diabetic patient with pancreatic failure needing a transplant. The man's policy stated it covered all of his diabetes-related expenses, but another section of the policy stated that it did not cover organ transplants. Moore conducted a fake funeral on the front steps of the Humana building, and three days later Humana changed its policy and authorized the man's treatment.Michael Moore's 2007 documentary Sicko used the video of Linda Peeno's testimony. On June 28, 2007, Humana declared that Peeno was never a Humana \"associate\" (permanent, full-time employee), but rather a \"part-time contractor.\" Humana disputed portions of her Congressional testimony by saying that because the patient's healthcare plan did not cover heart transplants, denial of coverage was valid.The U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services investigated Humana in 2009 for sending flyers to Medicare recipients that the AARP characterized as deceptive. In more detail - on September 21, 2009, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services opened an investigation into Humana mass mailings to elderly Medicare recipients.  The mail was made to appear to contain official information about Medicare Advantage and prescription drug benefit information, but instead alleged that core Medicare benefits could be cut by the Obama administration's healthcare reform, a claim refuted by John Rother, AARP's executive vice president. Douglas Elmendorf, the head of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), supported the claim that Medicare benefits could be cut, but his comments were in reference to just one of several congressional bills. CBO estimates of another healthcare reform bill found that changes to premiums would vary. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services instructed Humana to cease all such mailings to Medicare plan members pending an investigation. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, in a letter to the insurance industry, threatened that bad actors may be excluded from new health insurance markets that were to open in 2014. Senate Republicans pointed out in a letter to Sebelius that a 1997 directive from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services explicitly allowed HMOs to tell members about legislation and urge them to express opinions."

The mountain is located about 8 miles (13 km) east of Hiawassee and 4 miles (6.4 km) west of Tate City. Nearby geographical features include Rich Knob, Shooting Creek Bald, Loggy Branch Cove and Bly Gap. There are cliffs on the south face of the mountain.On Hightower Bald's northern slopes are two border features: Montgomery's Corner and the 30 Mile Post. Between these two points, the North Carolina-Georgia border runs in a north-south direction for about 2,000 feet (610 m) instead of its usual east-west direction. These border features were the results of two surveying expeditions conducted in the early 19th century. When Tennessee became a state in 1796, Congress designated Georgia's northern boundaries as the 35th parallel north. In 1818, mathematician James Camak incorrectly calculated the 35th parallel north as being located south of Nickajack Lake. Camak and his survey team then proceeded to mark Georgia's northern border 110 miles (180 km) east, stopping about 700 feet (210 m) north of Hightower Bald's summit.In 1819, Camak conducted another survey of Georgia's northern border, this time starting from Ellicott's Rock and surveying westward. After marking for 30 miles (48 km), Camak's group reached Hightower Bald's northern slopes. When they got there, they noticed that they were 661 yards (604 m) north of the previous year's mark. Instead of redoing the survey, Camak decided to connect the eastward and westward lines. The southern mark was named Montgomery's Corner, after a surveyor who accompanied Camak in his two surveying trips. This mistake played a part in a water rights dispute between Georgia and Tennessee; Georgia was unable to withdraw water from the Tennessee River despite the river passing through the 35th parallel."

Michael Schumacher pulled away from the slower car of Ralf Schumacher who baulked his teammate Juan Pablo Montoya, until his second pit stop on the 44th lap. Montoya led laps 46 to 50 before he ceded the lead to Michael Schumacher, who maintained it to take his sixth victory of the season and the 50th of his career.\nThe result enabled Michael Schumacher to increase his Drivers' Championship lead over Coulthard in second to 31 points. Ralf Schumacher's second-place finish moved him past Barrichello for third. Although he retired from the event, Montoya kept fifth.

It took place at the fifteen-turn 4.251 km (2.641 mi) Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours in the commune of Magny-Cours, Burgundy on 1 July 2001. The layout of the circuit provided a mixture of corners taken at low and high speeds with four long and short straights. It had a flat and smooth racing surface that had no single deformation around the track to disrupt the stability of the cars and the series' two tyre suppliers Bridgestone and Michelin brought soft compound tyres to maximise mechanical grip.Before the race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers' Championship with 68 points ahead of McLaren's David Coulthard (44 points) in second. Rubens Barrichello (26 points) in the second Ferrari was third and Williams driver Ralf Schumacher in fourth was one point behind in the battle for the position. The other Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya completed the top five in the standings with 12 points. In the Constructors' Championship Ferrari led with 94 points, with a 41-point gap over their nearest rivals McLaren in second. With 37 points, Williams were in third position and Sauber (15 points) and Jordan (13 points) contended for fourth place.In preparation for the Grand Prix, the Ferrari team tested its chassis, the F2001, the only constructor to do so. The outfit conducted a six-hour and 45-minute shakedown session on 28 June at the Fiorano Circuit with their test driver, Luca Badoer, who drove 45 km (28 mi) to test the functionality of the car electrical system and also concentrated on launch control system practice starts. After an FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Paris on 27 June 2001, all of the eleven teams unanimously agreed that starting from this event, any driver who stalled his car on the grid for the formation lap would be barred from using the spare car. The rule was revised to state that any switch into the spare car could only be undertaken fifteen seconds before the commencement of the formation lap and it would avoid any driver incurring a pit lane start.Coulthard had won the 2000 French Grand Prix and spoke of his anticipation that McLaren would be within four-tenths of a second of Ferrari depending on the amount of tyre degradation, \"So, in qualifying, again, unless the tyre that we have available to us works well on our car there, I don't think we have something in the set-up that we can change. It's probably something a bit more fundamental.\" He said that he did not want to be drawn into discussion over the Drivers' Championship and sought to extract his best performance over the rest of the season, \" I concentrate on the future because you can't change the past. What we can influence is the future and we won't be affected by the situation that we are in.\" Michael Schumacher stated his acknowledgement that Coulthard was his main rival for the Drivers' Championship, and took a race-by-race approach, \"The year is long and there are still eight races to go and I still have to calculate for David in particular. McLaren could still be very strong in Magny-Cours\"A total of 11 teams (each representing a different constructors) entered two drivers each for the event. Some teams made modifications to their cars for the race. The Renault engine manufacturer d\u00e9buted a revised specification of its V10 power unit in the Benetton B201s of Giancarlo Fisichella and Jenson Button. This however did not increase the overall top speed of the cars and they remained slow throughout the race meeting. All of the primary teams did not bring any major aerodynamic improvements to the Magny-Cours track as the Prost outfit installed revised its suspension geometry and modified the bodywork of the AP04 chassis. The Sauber team mounted a new front wing on the C20 that featured an V-shaped wing to support it and the British American Racing (BAR) squad introduced a new rear suspension design that was developed by its partner Honda on Olivier Panis' 003 chassis."

        "content": "Four practice sessions were held before the Sunday race\u2014two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final practice sessions on Saturday morning ran for 45 minutes. Weather conditions were hot and clear for the two practice sessions on Friday. In the first practice session, McLaren's Mika H\u00e4kkinen was fastest with a lap of 1 minute and 15.889 seconds, 0.155 seconds faster than Michael Schumacher in second. Coulthard and Barrichello were third and fourth, with the Williams of Ralf Schumacher and Montoya fifth and sixth. Jarno Trulli of the Jordan team, Panis, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Several drivers spun on the dusty track and into the gravel traps during the session. Ralf Schumacher's running ended early due to a water leak that was possibly caused by a damaged pipe in the car's sidepod from hitting debris off Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen's Sauber.Coulthard was quicker in the second practice session and recorded the day's fastest lap of 1 minute and 14.935 seconds. Eddie Irvine had increased pace in his Jaguar and he went second and Villeneuve was third. Fourth was H\u00e4kkinen and the Williams pair of Ralf Schumacher and Montoya placed fifth and sixth.  Michael Schumacher, Jaguar's Pedro de la Rosa, Trulli and Barrichello were in positions seven to ten. Jos Verstappen's engine failed in his Arrows A22 on the pit lane straight and he took over his teammate Enrique Bernoldi's Arrows car for the final 20 minutes of the session. An unstable rear caused Panis to pirouette into the gravel trap at the Adelaide hairpin. As R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen exited the pit lane, the front wing on his car detached, causing him to oversteer through the gravel trap at Estoril corner and shattering the front wing.It continued to be hot and clear for Saturday morning's two practice sessions. Michael Schumacher increased the performance of his car and was fastest in the third practice session with a lap of 1 minute and 13.729 seconds. He was 0.406 seconds clear of Coulthard in second and third was Ralf Schumacher. Barrichello was fourth-fastest, ahead of Montoya and Trulli in fifth and sixth places. Frentzen, Panis, Villeneuve and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen followed in the top ten. No incidents were reported during the session although H\u00e4kkinen did not record a timed lap. Although he did not improve his lap time Michael Schumacher remained quickest in the fourth practice session, with Ralf Schumacher in second. The two McLarens were third and fourth \u2013 Coulthard ahead of H\u00e4kkinen \u2013 with Trulli improving to fifth and Barrichello fell to sixth. Montoya was seventh-fastest, Sauber's Nick Heidfeld placed eighth, Irvine came ninth and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen duplicated his third practice session result in tenth ahead of qualifying."

        "content": "Saturday's afternoon one hour qualifying session saw each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the grid order decided by their fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver to set a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. Weather conditions for qualifying were hot and sunny. Ralf Schumacher twice surpassed the qualifying track record held by the 1992 World Champion Nigel Mansell to claim the first pole position of his career with a 1-minute and 12.989 seconds lap on his second timed lap. He was joined on the grid's front row by Michael Schumacher who was ten-thousandths of a second slower. He was distracted by the Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn over the radio and was later baulked by Trulli on his third timed lap. Coulthard qualified third on his fourth timed run with three minutes left and spoke of his feeling he could have improved further as he ran over gravel scattered by Luciano Burti's Prost at turn 13 causing him to make a minor mistake. His teammate H\u00e4kkinen had minor engine vibrations and an error on his final timed lap put him fourth. Trulli and Frentzen took fifth and seventh for the Jordan team. Trulli was pleased with the balance of his car and later apologised to Michael Schumacher for slowing the Ferrari driver while Frentzen was baulked by Panis. They were separated by Montoya's slower Williams who was pleased with how his car felt but was annoyed with Alesi who blocked Montoya during his last timed lap towards its conclusion.A handling balance problem that made his car anxious under braking and launched over the kerbs at the turn 13/14 chicane restricted Barrichello to eighth. Heidfeld made minor adjustments to improve the vehicle's balance and took ninth. Villeneuve used the first half an hour to adjust his front and rear flaps and took tenth, although he lost time through turn one. Panis took 11th after heavy traffic slowed his final timed lap. Irvine, 12th, spun twice during the session and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen in 13th expressed disappointment of the balance of his car. 14th-placed De La Rosa was kept from the circuit due to an electrical fault at his part of the garage and engine overheating and driver errors affected his on-track running. Burti's car was altered at midday and pirouetted his car on his third timed lap as he qualified 15th. Fisichella and Button of the Benetton outfit took 16th and 17th: Button was prevented from setting a faster lap because he forgot to change the setting of his differential exiting Estroil corner because he was too focused on the lap and he only remembered to alter the differential setting when he got to the Adelaide hairpin. Verstappen in 18th could not adapt the Arrows A22 to the track and he was ahead of 19th-placed Alesi spun at high-speed leaving the Imola chicane. Bernoldi was unable to extract additional speed from his car and took 20th. The two Minardis qualified at the rear of the field in 21st and 22nd places: Fernando Alonso was slowed on his final timed lap by Bernoldi, and his teammate Tarso Marques had a large amount of understeer that affected the handling of his chassis, which could not be rectified."

All drivers fine-tuned their race set-ups against the weather conditions of the time, undertook laps in their spare cars and Barrichello changed the setting of his rear wing. Although he spun towards the conclusion of the session, H\u00e4kkinen drove better than in qualifying and he was fastest with a lap of 1 minute and 15.428 seconds, which was one-thousands of a second faster than Michael Schumacher in second. Barrichello's car was corrected from having an unbalanced car with a change of electronic settings after a technical meeting and he placed third and Coulthard was fourth.

        "content": "The race took place in the afternoon from 14:00 local time. Weather conditions at the start were hot and clear. The air temperature ranged between 25 and 29 \u00b0C (77 and 84 \u00b0F) and the track temperature was from 40 to 51 \u00b0C (104 to 124 \u00b0F). The hot weather increased the possibility of mechanical attrition. Approximately 120,717 people attended the event. A two-stop strategy was the standard for the French Grand Prix and every pit stop took less time because of pit lane layout. H\u00e4kkinen could not get off the grid at the start of the formation lap because an assembled component in his car's gearbox was incorrectly fitted. His car was pushed back into the pit lane where the mechanics were unable to rectify the problem and H\u00e4kkinen did not take the start. De la Rosa's throttle failed during the formation lap and drove back to the pit lane and started one lap behind the rest of the field. When the five red flags extinguished to signal the start of the race, Ralf Schumacher made a brisk start to maintain his pole position advantage going into the first corner and retained despite an error at the Adelaide hairpin. Michael Schumacher in second was slower off the line due to a minor glitch between the launch control system and clutch that was changed after the warm-up session though he held off Coultard on the first lap.Barrichello had a fast gateway, rising from eighth to fifth by the end of the first lap. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen moved up four positions over the same distance. Montoya passed Trulli and the manoeuvre caused the latter to lose momentum and allow Barrichello to overtake him. At the end of the first lap, Ralf Schumacher led by 0.3 seconds from Michael Schumacher, who was in turn was followed by Coulthard, Montoya, Barrichello, Trulli, Frentzen, Villeneuve, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Heidfeld, Irvine, Panis, Burti, Verstappen, Bernoldi, Fisichella, Button, Alesi, Marques and Alonso. Ralf Schumacher extended his advantage to three-tenths of a second from Michael Schumacher with Coulthard close behind. Further down the field Panis passed Irvine to take over eleventh position, while Fisichella was overtaken by teammate Button for 16th. Villeneuve in eighth became the Grand Prix's first retirement when his engine lost power and he went into the gravel trap at Estroil corner on lap six. At the front of the field, Ralf Schumacher, driving with an unbalanced car that caused him to lock his tyres into the Adelaide hairpin, increased his lead over Michael Schumacher to 1.8 seconds by the 17th lap, who in turn, was 1.7 seconds in front of Coulthard in third. Montoya was a further 1.7 seconds adrift in fourth and he maintained a consistent gap ahead of Barrichello in fifth.That lap, Bernoldi retired with an engine failure. Irvine was challenging Panis for ninth though he was not able to pass and he fell back slightly before the first round of pit stops. In the meantime, the top five drivers were covered by a gap of ten seconds as all of them lapped in the 1 minute and 16 second range and began to lap slower drivers for the first time. Barrichello was the first lead driver to make a pit stop on the 21st lap. He rejoined the track in seventh place. That lap, Irvine overtook Panis around the inside at Lycee corner for ninth. Three laps later, Ralf Schumacher made his first pit stop from the lead. His crew had trouble fitting the car's right-rear tyre because Ralf Schumacher engaged first gear before the mechanic fitted it. He lost 2.8 seconds and returned to the circuit in fourth. Michael Schumacher led the 26th lap and increased his pace before his own stop for fuel, which took 7.7 seconds. He emerged in third, ahead of Ralf Schumacher but behind Coulthard and Montoya. Montoya led the next three laps as Michael Schumacher began to draw closer to him. On lap 30, Montoya made his first pit stop and he rejoined the track in fifth place.\nAfter the pit stops, Michael Schumacher led Ralf Schumacher by 7.2 seconds, who in turn, was 1.1 seconds ahead of the third-placed Coulthard. Barrichello was another two seconds behind in fourth and the rest of the top six was completed by Montoya and Trulli. On lap 31, the stewards informed the McLaren team that Coulthard had incurred a ten-second stop-and-go penalty because he was observed going 5 km/h (3.1 mph) above the 80 km/h (50 mph) pit lane speed limit because he disengaged his pit lane speed limiter before crossing the white line denoting the pit lane exit. He took the penalty on the following lap. Coulthard lost 26.8 seconds and he fell from third to fifth. On lap 35, Verstappen passed Alonso to move into 16th. Barrichello made his second pit stop one lap later in Ferrari's aim to get him in clean air and move past Ralf Schumacher. He returned in fourth place. As Michael Schumacher continued to pull away from Ralf Schumacher, it became apparent that the latter was delaying his teammate Montoya. The Williams team attempted to order Ralf Schumacher to cede second place to Montoya though he did not do so because of radio communication problems with his earpiece and Montoya lost time.At the end of lap 42, Irvine drew to the right of Frentzen and out-braked him at the Imola chicane as Frentzen cut the corner to retain eighth. Irvine gesticulated at the Jaguar gantry on the pit lane to signal that Frentzen performed an illegal manoeuvre. Frentzen then ceded the position to Irvine to avoid incurring a penalty. On lap 44, the technical director of the Williams team Patrick Head went to his outfit's gantry on the pit wall to instruct Ralf Schumacher to enter the pit lane earlier than scheduled. Michael Schumacher made his second pit stop for tyres on the next lap and rejoined the circuit in second place, three seconds behind Montoya, who assumed the lead. Montoya increased his pace to hold a five-second advantage when he entered the pit lane for his second scheduled stop on the 50th lap. He emerged in fourth position, ahead of Ralf Schumacher as Michael Schumacher returned to the lead. Montoya pulled off to the side of the track with smoke bellowing from his engine on lap 53, ending his race. Barrichello entered the pit lane for his third and final stop on the next lap. It took 7.7 seconds and he emerged in third position. On lap 56, Irvine stopped on the grass at the right-hand side of the Adelaide hairpin with a pneumatic valve system failure.Coulthard drew close to Barrichello at the Adelaide hairpin on lap 58 after the latter ran wide. He dropped back from Barrichello through Estroil corner three laps later. Button pirouetted through 720 degrees into the gravel trap at the Adelaide hairpin because he pushed too hard and had oversteer on the 63rd lap though he continued. He consequently had too deal with heavy vibrations at high speeds from flat-spotting a tyre after locking the wheels for a long period of time under braking. Further down the field, de la Rosa overtook Alonso for 15th position, and Alonso was called into the pit lane to retire with suspected engine problems located on the Minardi telemetry equipment. On lap 68, Coulthard to pass Barrichello on the left-hand side of the track on the run to the Adelaide hairpin while the two lapped Alesi's slower car though he could not complete the manoeuvre as Barrichello accelerated faster than him at the corner. On lap 71, an oversteer and a rear tyre lock sent Button into a spin through 180 degrees into a gravel trap and retired with a fuel pressure pick-up problem. Upfront, Michael Schumacher was told over the radio to reduce his pace to avoid excessive strain on his car, and he maintained the lead to take his sixth victory of the season and the 50th of his career. Ralf Schumacher was 10.399 seconds behind in second and Barrichello completed the podium finishers in third. Off the podium, Coulthard finished fourth, Trulli fifth and Heidfeld completed the points-scoring positions in sixth."

        "content": "Within the party, there are no formal factions, yet there are some unofficial groupings.\nGian Paolo Gobbo and Luca Zaia have long been the leaders of the wing from Treviso, which has its roots in the original Liga Veneta and is more Venetist in character, while the Verona wing, whose standard-bearers have been Flavio Tosi, Federico Bricolo and Lorenzo Fontana, is more conservative and has stronger links with Lega Lombarda. While Lighisti from Venice are usually closer to Gobbo and Zaia, those from Vicenza and Padua are set somewhere in the middle between Treviso and Verona.\nAn ideological strain worth of mention is embodied by pure Venetists who stress issues such as Venetian identity and language: they have notably included Massimo Bitonci, Roberto Ciambetti, Stival, Giovanni Furlanetto and Nicola Finco.Gobbo was re-elected secretary in 2007 due to an agreement with Tosi, who was Gobbo's strongest rival for the leadership. At the 2012 congress Tosi defeated the Venetists' standard-bearer Bitonci, who was supported by 43% of delegates and most MPs.\nIn 2011 in the party were outraged when Tosi, as mayor of Verona, announced that he was going to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Italian unification and declared that Italian unity was a good thing. Gobbo promptly disavowed Tosi and confirmed that the party was opposed to any celebration. Tosi was criticised also by other party bigwigs, such as Francesca Martini, while Furlanetto proposed the ejection of Tosi from the party.  In early 2012 another friction was caused by Tosi's decision to present a personal list, alongside the party's one, in the forthcoming Verona municipal election and his intention to drop its traditional ally, The People of Freedom. Not only Gobbo opposed the move by Tosi, but he also took the opportunity to describe Tosi's views on Italy and Padania as \"heresy\".It is difficult to say who was more conservative or liberal between Tosi and Zaia, who have often exchanged their positions within the party. Tosi was a more traditional conservative-liberal, while Zaia, while being a centrist, has resembled a green-populist position on environmental issues, nuclear power, GMOs, etc. In occasion of the 2011 referendums, Zaia declared his support for three referendums aimed at blocking the return to nuclear energy and the privatisation of water services. Needless to say, Tosi declared himself a \"keen nuclearist\" and a supporter of the free market instead. At the federal level of the party, Tosi was a long-time ally of Roberto Maroni."

The tests were performed by the Defense Nuclear Agency.\nThe tests were to study the Christofilos effect, which suggested it was possible to defend against Soviet nuclear missiles by exploding a small number of nuclear bombs high over the South Pacific. This would create a disk of electrons over the United States that would overload the electronics on the Soviet warheads as they descended. It was also possible to use the effect to blind Soviet radars, meaning that any Soviet missile-based ABM system would be unable to attack the US counterstrike.\nThe tests demonstrated that the effect did occur, but that it dissipated too rapidly to be very effective. Papers concerning the topic were published the next year, emphasizing the events as purely scientific endeavors."

Such belts would be similar in effect to the Van Allen radiation belts. \"Such radiation belts were viewed as having possible tactical use in war, including degradation of radio and radar transmissions, damage or destruction of the arming and fuzing mechanisms of ICBM warheads, and endangering the crews of orbiting space vehicles that might enter the belt.\" Prior to Argus, Hardtack Teak had shown disruption of radio communications from a nuclear blast, though this was not due to the creation of radiation belts.\nArgus was implemented rapidly after inception due to forthcoming bans on atmospheric and exoatmospheric testing in October 1958. Consequently, the tests were performed within a mere half-year of conception (whereas \"normal\" testing took one to two years). Because nuclear testing during this time was arguably a violation of the rules, the military borrowed International Geophysical Year equipment to disguise the nuclear tests.\nTwo missiles, with warheads 136\u2013227 kg to be launched within one month of each other, originating from a single site.\nThe missiles were to be detonated at altitudes of 200\u20131,000 miles (320\u20131,610 km), and also at 2,000\u20134,000 miles (3,200\u20136,400 km). Both detonations should occur near the geomagnetic equator.\nSatellites were to be placed in equatorial (up to 30\u00b0) and polar (up to 70\u00b0) orbits, with perigees of roughly 322 kilometers (200 mi) and apogees of roughly 2,900 kilometers (1,800 mi) or greater. These satellites were to be used to measure electron density over time, and include a magnetometer, as well as a means for measuring ambient radio noise. Measurements were to be taken before the shots to determine a baseline, as well as during and after the events.\nSounding rockets, launched from appropriate ground locations, were to carry the same instrumentation as the satellites, except for radio noise. Ground stations to be used to study effects on radio astronomy and radar probing as well as auroral measurements.Originally Argus was designated Hardtack-Argus, and later Floral. For reasons of security, both names were disused in favor of the independent name Argus.\nFunding was provided by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP), the predecessor of the present Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Total funds allotted for the project were US$9,023,000."

Of particular note among the missing documents were the film records (which recorded radiation levels during the Argus tests).

Due to the South Atlantic Anomaly, the Van Allen radiation belt is closer to the Earth's surface at that location. The (extreme) altitude of the tests was chosen so as to prevent personnel involved with the test from being exposed to any ionizing radiation. Even with the very minor threat of radiation exposure, precautions were taken to prevent radiological exposure. The task force commander and his staff had devisd a series of precautionary radiation safe measures to be followed in each stage of the operation. Though the chance of exposure to radiation from these missiles was minute, the safety measures were performed as directed by the commander by the crew of Task Force 88.Coordinated measurement programs involving satellite, rocket, aircraft, and surface stations were employed by the services as well as other government agencies and various contractors worldwide.\nThe Argus explosions created artificial electron belts resulting from the \u03b2-decay of fission fragments. These lasted for several weeks. Such radiation belts affect radio and radar transmissions, damage or destroy arming and fusing mechanisms of intercontinental ballistic missile warheads, and endanger crews of orbiting space vehicles. It was found after performing these tests that the explosions did in fact degrade the reception and transmission of radar signals, another proof that Christofilos was correct about the Christofilos effect.Argus proved the validity of Christofilos' theory: the establishment of an electron shell derived from neutron and \u03b2-decay of fission products and ionization of device materials in the upper atmosphere was demonstrated. It not only provided data on military considerations, but produced a \"great mass\" of geophysical data.\n\nThe tests were first reported journalistically by Hanson Baldwin and Walter Sullivan of The New York Times on 19 March 1959, headlining it as the \"greatest scientific experiment ever conducted\". This was an unauthorized publication that caused great controversy among scientists because many of them were unaware of the presence of artificial particles in the Earth's atmosphere. Approximately nine ships and 4,500 people participated with the operation. After the completion of testing, the task force returned to the United States via Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nThe tests were announced officially the next year, but the full results and documentation of the tests were not declassified until 30 April 1982."

        "content": "The need for Busen arose from a nationalistic fervour in Japan after the Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895). Increased Japanese nationalism led to an increased interest in the \"martial way\".\nTraditionally, Japanese martial arts had been taught as part of the standard curriculum in schools across Japan. The arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry's \"Black Ships\" in 1853 caused the Japanese to abandon their \"archaic\" martial arts and use western firepower. Martial arts were considered outdated and part of Japan's feudal history, and schools deemphasized traditional martial arts.\nInterest in martial arts was raised again in 1873 by Sakakibara Kenkichi, a proud man of hatamoto status who was disturbed by the loss of traditional swordsmanship and martial arts. He arranged a series of performances by well known martial artists called gekken kogyo. Despite the entrance fee, these events became immensely popular and once again raised interest in martial arts.\nBy 1880 the police had recognised the importance of Kendo and other traditional martial arts and wrote it into the Police Academy guidelines that all cadets should be instructed in Kendo."

        "content": "This popularity also raised interest in the field of education. In the 1870s, there were a number of people who were raising concerns over the total westernisation of Japanese schools. The Ministry of Education carried out an investigation, the most notable in 1883 by the National Institute of Gymnastics (Taiso Denshujo), and then the 1896 investigation carried out by the School Health Advisors' Board (Gakko Eisei Komonkai). The conclusion of both of these surveys was that it would be inappropriate to introduce bujutsu (Japanese martial arts in general) into the school curriculum, in anything other than a spiritual way (the 1896 survey suggested that boys over 16 could study bujutsu).\nThis led to a number of people, notably Ozawa Unosuke and Nakajima Kenzo, to try to develop a gymnastics adaptation of bujutsu. This was met with some criticism, and it was noted that the techniques were ineffective and did not take into account the blade or the direction of travel.\n1895 marked the 1,100th year of Kyoto becoming the capital of Japan. Emperor Kanmu is said to have constructed a Butokuden (Hall of Martial Virtue) to promote martial spirit and encourage warriors. In commemoration of this, the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (Butoku Kai) was established in Kyoto, under the authority of the Minister of Education. The formation of the Butoku Kai was a major turning point for getting martial arts back into the school curriculum. The goals of the Butoku Kai were to standardise the plethora of martial disciplines found throughout the nation.In 1905, a division of the Butoku Kai was formed to train bujutsu instructors called Bujutsu Kyoin Yoseijo. This system was revised and improved a number of times, and then led to the formation of the Butoku Gakko (School of Martial Virtue) in 1911. This became known as the Bujutsu Senmon Gakko (Bujutsu Specialist School) in 1912, and then the Budo Senmon Gakko in 1919 when the term 'budo' officially replaced 'bujutsu'. The Budo Senmon Gakko (or Busen as it became known) together with the Tokyo Koto Shihan Gakko (Tokyo Higher Normal School) led the way in producing young instructors; these would be posted to schools throughout the country, to teach children the arts.The first class of 8 students graduated in March 1914.\nBudo Senmon Gakko continued to produce excellent instructors until the outbreak of World War II, as more and more students were drafted into the Japanese military. After the war, Allied occupation forces prohibited opening the school. It remained vacant for decades. The buildings have since been restored and upgraded, and now tournaments are held in the dojo."

        "content": "The Bethel Foundation, officially the Bodelschwingh Foundation Bethel (German: von Bodelschwinghsche Stiftungen Bethel as of 2009, previously v. Bodelschwinghsche Anstalten Bethel) is a diaconal (i.e. Protestant charitable) psychiatric hospital in Bethel, formerly a town, today a neighbourhood of Bielefeld, Germany.\n\nThe healthcare foundation was established in 1867 as Evangelische Heil- und Pflegeanstalt f\u00fcr Epileptische (Protestant institute of healing and care for epileptics) in Gadderbaum, today a locality of Bielefeld. In 1872 Pastor Friedrich von Bodelschwingh, Senior, a proponent of the inner mission within the then Evangelical State Church in Prussia became its director. He massively strengthened and extended the institution, with more premises also for the poor and at other locations, and renamed it after Bethel in 1874. The name Bethel was also started being used for the neighbourhood, which developed outside the hospital. Later Bodelschwingh's name was compounded to the institution's name. In 1910 Bodelschwingh, Senior, died and the leadership passed on to his son Friedrich von Bodelschwingh, Junior, who led the institution until his death in 1946.The institution is notable for its resistance against the Nazi Germany era. In August 1933, some six months after Hitler had become Reich Chancellor, Pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior, met with Dietrich Bonhoeffer and a few others to draft a new confession of faith, clarifying the grounds for resisting the Nazification of Germany, the Bethel Confession Betheler_Bekenntnis. The resulting document, the Barmen Declaration, was an early form of resistance to Hitler, a rejection of Christian anti-Judaism and racist anti-Semitism, though in practical terms it did nothing to impede the Nazis. During the course of the T-4 Euthanasia Program, which ran in 1940 and 1941 and was aimed at exterminating physically and mentally disabled people, the staff at the institution were mainly in opposition to that crime of the National Socialist party. In 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered the gassing of all mental patients. The director of the hospital, pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior, resisted.\n\"You can put me into a concentration camp if you want, that is your affair.  But as long as I am free, you do not touch one of my patients.  I cannot change to fit the times or the wishes of the F\u00fchrer.  I stand under orders from our Lord Jesus Christ.\" - Pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior Parts of the hospitals were destroyed in a British Royal Air Force air raid in 1940. In religious respect the Bethel Institution is related to the Evangelical Church of Westphalia, the Westphalian regional successor of the old-Prussian Church. In 1946 Bodelschwingh, Junior, died and Friedrich von Bodelschwingh (1902\u20131977), nephew of Bodelschwingh, Junior, and grandson of the Senior, started managing the part of the Bethel Institution located at Gadderbaum, serving as the general director of all the Bethel Institutions between 1959 and 1969. The Bethel Institution is currently still being used as a mental hospital."

A square has been named as \"Barman Chowk\" in Kareli.\nBarman is the holy place,Barman has two main ghat- one is the bramhan ghat and other is retghat. In retghat every year a fair is organised in which thousands of people come from all over India\"\"cn\"\". The junction of the Narmada and Warahi rivers at Brahman is a sacred place and a large fair is held here in January. A number of temples have been constructed at Barmhan, and fine flights of steps leading up from the Narmada on the northern bank.The large temple on the southern bank of the river is called Rani Durgavati's, as it is supposed to have been built by the famous queen of the Gond-Rajput dynasty of Mandla. Another temple on this side is called the Pisanhari's, as it is supposed to have been built by a corn-grinder out of her small earnings. Another important temple is that of Lakshmi Narayan. At the top of the steps on the northern bank is a great gateway called the Hathi Darwaza, as elephants can pass through it. This was built by the Lodhi malguzar of Umaria. There are several temples on this side, the principal ones being the Bairagi's temple, built by a well-known Bairagi of Indore, and a temple of Rama and Lakshman with a large pillar of stone in front, on which are depicted the past and future Avatars of Vishnu. Nearly opposite to Barmhan there is an island in the Nerbudda, and at this place five kunds or small tanks are shown which are supposed to have been used by the Pandava brothers during their sojourn at Barmhan. There is also a foot-print of Bhima. The island contains a copper mine which was formerly worked by the Nerbudda Coal and Iron Company,but was abandoned as unprofitable. The fair is held in January and lasts for a month, the shops and booths being located in the bed of the Nerbudda. The attendance is heavy on the principal day of the festival of Til Sankrant. It is a very old fair and was formerly of great importance, as it was the annual occasion for the purchase of cloth, household utensils and other important commodities for the whole District. The merchandise brought to Barmhan in 1864 was estimated by the Deputy Commissioner to be worth more than 6 lakhs of rupees, of which more than half found a sale. The principal article of trade was English cloth of which two lakhs worth were received. Next to this lac ornaments and brass and copper utensils were the commonest goods. In 1892 the value of goods brought was Rs. 2-37 lakhs and that of the sales Rs. 1-57 lakhs. The total attendance is said to have been 450,000. In 1903-04 the total number of shops was 253, most of them being for the sale of cloth, metal vessels and utensils, and provisions. Statistics of the sales of produce are not available. An agricultural and cattle show is now also held and prizes aredistributed by the District authorities. The village of Barmhan is held revenue-free for the support of the temple of Lakshmi Narayan.[1]"

A complicated formula apportioned legislators to Ohio counties and the number of seats in the legislative houses varied from year-to-year.The Ohio Politics Almanac by Michael F. Curtin (Kent State University Press) described apportionment thus:\n\nThe new [1851] constitution ... contained a complicated formula for apportionment, the so-called \"major fraction rule.\" Under it, the state's population was divided by 100, with the resulting quotient being the ratio of representation in the House of Representatives. Any county with a population equal to at least half the ratio was entitled to one representative; a county with a population of less than half the ratio was grouped with an adjacent county for districting; a county containing a population of at least one and three-fourths the ratio was entitled to two representatives; a county with a population equal to three times the ratio was entitled to three representatives. To determine Senate districts, a similar procedure was followed; the starting point, however was figured by dividing the state's population by 35. The ratios for the House and Senate and the resulting apportionment was determined by a board consisting of the governor, auditor, and secretary of state.\nIn 1903, the apportionment system was modified by the Hanna amendment, which also gave the governor veto power over the assembly's acts, which could be overridden by a two-thirds vote of both houses. The last state constitutional convention, held in 1912, gave the governor a line-item veto, but reduced the supermajority required for overriding the veto to three-fifths. In 1956, a referendum increased the terms of state senators from two to four years.\nThe Hanna amendment (which guaranteed each county at least one representative and all members elected at large) guaranteed that rural areas of Ohio would dominate the legislature. However, several decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court surrounding the legal principal of one man, one vote mandated apportionment proportional to population. Reapportionment was ordered in 1964. Starting with the 1966 election, the number of seats in the two chambers were fixed at their present numbers of 33 and 99.\nRepublican activists, led by Fred A. Lennon, began pursuing term limits in the 1980s, in 1992, a referendum set term limits of eight consecutive years in office: four consecutive terms in the House or two consecutive terms in the Senate. Years in office are considered consecutive if they are separated by less than four years. A former member of the legislature who had served eight years becomes eligible for election to the legislature after four years out of office."

        "content": "After an initiative committee for the construction of the Mittel-Thurgau-Bahn (Central Thurgau Railway; MThB) was established in Kreuzlingen on 11 August 1890, the committee made its first contacts with the Westdeutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (West German Railway Company; WeEG) based in Cologne in 1899. An application for a concession for a standard-gauge railway, which had been prepared by engineer Jakob Ehrensperger from Winterthur, was submitted to the Federal Council in 1901. The Swiss Federal Assembly granted the concession for a railway from Wil via Weinfelden to the state border at Konstanz on 19 December 1902. The Grand Duchy of Baden State Ministry approved the entrance of the line into Konstanz station in 1903. The initiative committee concluded a 15-year non-terminable contract for the construction and operation of a standard-gauge Wil-Weinfelden-Konstanz railway with the WeEG in 1906. This contract used the name Mittel-Thurgau-Bahn - MThB for the first time and a joint stock company was founded under this name on 28 April 1908. The issue of stock began on 26 November 1906. The largest share purchase was made by the canton of Thurgau, other notable share purchases were made by the three cities of Konstanz, Weinfelden and Wil as well as the canton of St. Gallen. Another 27 municipalities along with private interests joined the share register. The WeEG raised bonds worth CHF 3 million.\nThe ground-breaking ceremony was held  between Weinfelden and Thur on 10 September 1909. 60,000 cubic metres of earth were moved. Among the seven engineering structures to be built were four large structures. Work on the Bussnang viaduct was started late and the last section to be built was from the Weinfelden mountain down to Weinfelden because detailed approvals were delayed. The inspection of the iron bridges began in 1911. The Thur bridge was loaded with three type B 3/4 tender locomotives of the SBB, each weighing approximately 85 tons. Further investigations of the substructure and superstructure, the intersections of the railway with power lines, the structures and the rolling stock, finally allowed the opening of the Wil\u2013Weinfelden\u2013Kreuzlingen\u2013Konstanz line on 16 December 1911. The WeEG operated the line under contract. The contract for operations was transferred to Vereinigte Kleinbahnen AG (VKA) of Frankfurt am Main in 1931. It sold its interest, in particular the interest-bearing bonds, to the AG f\u00fcr Verkehrswesen in Berlin Wilmersdorf, with a small proportion going to the Overseas Trust Corporation Ltd. of Johannesburg. A package of bearer shares had been issued to Midland Bank Ltd. of London, but the VKA bought them back in 1938. The contract for operations was temporarily suspended during the war years. After the First and Second World Wars, the MThB was an important source of hard currency for German counterparties in the periods of high inflation. The contract was terminated at the end of 1950 and the MThB took over its own operations.\n\nThe 41-kilometre, standard-gauge and single-track line from Kreuzlingen via Weinfelden to Wil lies predominantly in the canton of Thurgau, while only the last, four-kilometre section is in the canton of St. Gallen. It was opened on 20 December 1911 for passenger and freight traffic and operated with steam trains. From 1938 it was also operated with a diesel railcar, initially rented. As the last significant private railway in Switzerland, it introduced electrical operations on 24 September 1965. The Reiseb\u00fcro Mittelthurgau, which operates river cruises, was founded as a subsidiary in 1969.\nThe trains generally began and ended in Konstanz, where a connection to the German state railway network existed. They used the 1 km-long Kreuzlingen\u2013Konstanz line, which had been opened by the Swiss National Railway (Schweizerische Nationalbahn; SNB) on 17 July 1875 and later transferred to the SBB.\nShortly before its end, the MThB expanded and also took over lines that ran to Germany. However, investments in infrastructure and rolling stock meant that it assumed considerable debt. Mittelthurgaubahn AG was finally dissolved on 11 October 2002. The chief executives were Peter Joss, longtime director, and Hermann Lei (a former member of the Grand Council of Thurgau). The rolling stock and the equipment were taken over by Thurbo AG."

Very early relations with British settlers were cordial but as farmers started clearing and fencing the land affecting food resources in the area, clashes between the groups arose until 1816 when a number of indigenous people were massacred and the remainder retreated from direct conflict with the settlers.In 1795, a group of lost cattle was discovered in the area, earning it the name Cowpastures. In 1805, a small hut was built at Elderslie near the ford on the Nepean River to house two constables assigned to keep an eye on the cattle. This was the first house built by British settlers in the Camden region. Later the same year, wool pioneer John Macarthur was granted 5,000 acres (20 km\u00b2) at Cowpastures. After the land was cleared, it was used for farming for most of the next 200 years until Sydney's suburban sprawl reached the town of Camden and modern suburbs like Elderslie were subdivided into housing blocks.\nElderslie Post Office opened on 1 January 1839 and closed on 30 April 1841 when it was replaced by the nearby Camden office. It reopened on 1 August 1876 and closed in 1969."

A 1758 map referred to it as the \"Padoucas River\". An early reference to the river as the Smoky Hill was by American explorer Zebulon Pike during his 1806 expedition to visit the Pawnee. The Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act of 1854 established Kansas Territory, including the entire length of the Smoky Hill River.With the onset of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush in 1858, an ancient American Indian trail along the river known as the Smoky Hill Trail provided the shortest, fastest route west across Kansas. Beginning in 1865, the trail was the route for the short-lived Butterfield Overland Despatch. To protect travelers, the U.S. Army established several forts along the trail, including Fort Downer, Fort Harker, Fort Hays, Fort Monument, and Fort Wallace. Before American colonization, the land along the Smoky Hill River was favored hunting ground for the Plains Indians. In 1867, the Comanche and the Kiowa, and in 1868, the Sioux and the Arapaho signed treaties withdrawing their opposition to the construction of a railroad along the Smoky Hill River. The Kansas Pacific Railway was completed in 1870, rendering the Smoky Hill Trail obsolete.In 1948, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers finished construction of a dam on the Smoky Hill for flood control in southeastern Ellsworth County creating Kanopolis Lake. In 1951, the United States Bureau of Reclamation completed another dam on the river, for irrigation and flood control, in southeastern Trego County, Kansas, which created Cedar Bluff Reservoir."

It operated under the name Dragon Fyre from 1981 to 1997, when it was respelled to Dragon Fire. The name was quietly reverted to the original name in 2019. It was one of the four original coasters at Canada's Wonderland.The ride is built at the east end of the park in the Medieval Faire section. It is located adjacent to the parking lot, so it is one of the first coasters that is seen. The coaster has a green and yellow track with purple support poles. Since the removal of Drachen Fire from Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Dragon Fyre is also the only Arrow Dynamics coaster in existence to have counterclockwise-turning corkscrews.Dragon Fyre was designed to operate with three trains, which is made evident by the fact that the ride has a set of safety brakes following the corkscrews and before the helix. However, due to the ride's short duration, it would be very difficult for the ride staff to load a train in the station without having one train stop in the middle of the ride. Because of this, Dragon Fyre never used its third train. In 1987, the third train was modified for use on The Bat."

Schuller. The ministry's weekly television program Hour of Power was formerly produced from the building. Crystal Cathedral Ministries filed for bankruptcy in October 2010 and in February 2012 sold the building and its adjacent campus to the Diocese of Orange for use as the diocese's new cathedral.

The call letters stood for 'Arnold Hornbuckle Records.' At the time of licensing, he owned Hornbuckle's Record Shop, also in Huntsville. Shortly after the station began broadcasting, Bill Lane became the station's manager and a minority shareholder. Lane retired in 1990.\nIn the early 1960s, a signature station phrase was \"Broadcasting from the top of the Times Building\". Some of the station's early operators were U.S. Army servicemen stationed at Redstone Arsenal and promotional literature included a letter from Dr. Wernher von Braun complimenting the station on its classical music programs. By the 1970s, though, the station had dropped fine arts programming in favor of what became known as adult contemporary music, which is roughly its present format; public station WLRH took over classical broadcasting to the area when it began in 1976. After nearly 40 years serving the Tennessee Valley, Hornbuckle retired, selling the station in July 1999. In 2009, Hornbuckle was inducted into the Alabama Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame. He died in 2012.WAHR is currently owned by Black Crow Media Group whose other local radio stations include WRTT-FM and WLOR. In November 2001, due to a proposed refinancing of the parent company, license holder STG Media, LLC, applied to the FCC to transfer the licenses of WAHR, WLOR, and WRTT-FM to Black Crow Media Group subsidiary BCA Media, LLC. Just two days later, another application was filed to shift the licenses to BCA Radio, LLC. The FCC approved the moves on November 15, 2001, and the consummation of the transaction occurred on November 19, 2001.In June 2009, the station transitioned from an adult contemporary music format to a Hot AC music mix. As of May 2013, though, the station had returned to its former mainstream AC format.\nIn January 2010, Black Crow Media Group and its subsidiaries filed for \"Chapter 11\" bankruptcy, seeking to reorganize rather than be broken up. Their filing with the FCC notified the Commission of the involuntary transfer of the license from BCA Radio, LLC, to an entity known as BCA Radio, LLC, Debtor-In-Possession.In November 2011, Black Crow Media Group announced that it was reorganizing its radio holdings and consolidating the four subsidiaries acting as debtors in possession (including BCA Radio, LLC) into a new company named Southern Stone Communications, LLC.

Shortly before the Japanese period a German sulfur merchant established the first hot spring club in Beitou.During early Japanese rule, Hokut\u014d (Pak-t\u00e2u) was a village at the entrance of the well-known North Formosa sulfur district. Three Japanese extracting plants in this district produced about 200 short tons (180,000 kg) of sulfur monthly. The Japanese had already recognized the value of the village as a sanitary resort and constructed a Japanese inn with hot mineral baths provided by the sulfur springs. The hot springs have been developed to include aroma therapy, massage, acupuncture, hydrotherapy, and excellent cuisine which complement the entire spa experience. The mineral waters stream from the numerous geothermal vents that occur naturally in the region and are famous for their health benefits.\nBetween 1920 and 1941, Hokut\u014d Village (\u5317\u6295\u5e84) was governed under Shichisei District, Taihoku Prefecture. It was upgraded to a Hokut\u014d Town in 1941.\nAfter the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, it was renamed as Peitou urban township (\u5317\u6295\u93ae), belonging to Taipei County. Beginning in 1949, Peitou and Shilin were administered by the newly formed Yangmingshan Administrative Bureau. Both of them were merged into Taipei City on 1 July 1968 as districts. In 1974, Yangmingshan Administrative Bureau underwent restructuring and Beitou District was placed under direct jurisdiction of Taipei City."

        "content": "KSTP has its origins in the Twin Cities radio station WAMD (\"Where All Minneapolis Dances\"), which started broadcasting live dance music from a local ballroom on February 13, 1925 with Stanley E. Hubbard as owner and station director. It was the first radio station to be completely supported by income generated by advertisements.\nIn 1928, WAMD merged with KFOY (Kind Friends of Yours) radio (first broadcast: March 12, 1924) in St. Paul to become KSTP, which was advertised as being operated by the National Battery Broadcasting Co. Hubbard became the merged station's general manager, and bought controlling interest in 1941. In 1938 Hubbard bought the first television camera available from RCA. Following the television blackout brought on by World War II, KSTP began television broadcasts in 1948.\nKSTP is still Hubbard's flagship, although there are now three different stations that carry that name. KSTP (AM) broadcasts a sports radio format, and KSTP-FM broadcasts adult contemporary music; KSTP-TV is affiliated with ABC.\nAfter the Federal Communications Commission relaxed rules about television station ownership, Hubbard bought a second television station in the Twin Cities. Originally affiliated with the Home Shopping Network when it started operations in 1994, KVBM was bought by Hubbard and became general-entertainment independent station KSTC-TV in 2000. It has been used as an alternate outlet for ABC network programming when KSTP-TV is broadcasting coverage of Minnesota Vikings football games or other special shows, including severe-weather coverage.\nAside from terrestrial broadcast stations, other current ventures include the film network ReelzChannel (launched in 2006), the arts network Ovation, and the Hubbard Radio Network, which is used to distribute KSTP's local talk shows to subscribing radio stations in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The cable channels are run through subsidiary company Hubbard Media Group.\nIn 1981, Hubbard Broadcasting started U.S. Satellite Broadcasting (USSB), and later was instrumental in the development and launching of the first digital satellite system for television in 1994. The new satellite could deliver 175 channels to a (at the time) tiny, 18 inch dish. USSB's development partner, Hughes Electronics (a General Motors subsidiary), launched its own subscription satellite service called DirecTV. The two services did not compete against each other (they carried different channels), and were often marketed together to subscribers by retailers and in advertisements, until DirecTV's 1998 acquisition of USSB.\nHubbard was also instrumental in the development of mobile satellite news vehicles. In 1983, Hubbard-owned CONUS Communications and Florida-based subsidiary Hubcom built the first Satellite News Gathering (SNG) mobile vehicle, which allowed for much easier live news coverage for network and local television news operations. This ultimately resulted in CONUS\u2014later a joint-venture with Viacom\u2014becoming a nationwide, satellite-based newsgathering cooperative (with Hubbard charging stations to relay their footage). As an outgrowth of this, Hubbard Broadcasting also operated a 24-hour news station, the All News Channel, which relied on CONUS-sourced news footage and primarily acted as a \"sustaining feed\" for television stations to fill air time with; ANC was also responsible for producing news programming for third-parties. The news channel lasted from 1989 until it folded in September 2002, which the channels trademark was spun off to became a website which relaunched.\nHubbard Broadcasting also owned the now-closed Bound to be Read bookstores in St. Paul, Albuquerque, and Key Largo.\nAs of October 2007, it is engaged in a fevered battle with NABET union repping employees of WNYT in Albany, New York.\nIn June 2009, the \"Society of Professional Journalists\" honored Hubbard Broadcasting and KSTP-TV with its national Historical Site in Journalism award.On January 19, 2011, Hubbard announced the purchase of 17 radio stations in Cincinnati, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and St. Louis from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints subsidiary Bonneville International for $505 million. The sale closed on April 29, 2011.On February 25, 2013, Hubbard announced that it would purchase MyNetworkTV station WNYA to form a duopoly with WNYT, pending FCC approval. No financial details were announced.On July 16, 2013, Hubbard announced that it had agreed to purchase 10 stations from Ohio-based Sandusky Radio for $85.5 million.\nHubbard announced on November 13, 2014 that it would purchase the sixteen stations owned by Omni Broadcasting. The Omni stations are all located in central and northern Minnesota.On September 26, 2018, Hubbard announced that it agreed to purchase six stations owned by Alpha Media in West Palm Beach Florida, for $88 million. The stations include Urban AC 102.3 WMBX, Country 103.1 WIRK, Adult Contemporary 107.9 WEAT, Hot Adult Contemporary 97.9 WRMF, News/Talk 850 WFTL and Sports/Talk 640 WMEN.\nHubbard Broadcasting took over production of Country Top 40 in January 2020 after the death of the program's founder Bob Kingsley. Fitz, a mononymous host with several syndicated country radio programs to his credit, took over as the program's host."

The principal tribes living in this region included the Pomo, Coast Miwok, Wappo and Patwin, whose early peoples practiced certain forms of agriculture, but probably  not involving the cultivation of grapes.  During the Mexican Colonial period and after, European settlers brought in more intensive agriculture to the Wine Country, including growing grapes and wine production. Some of the historical events that led to the establishment of California as a state transpired in the Wine Country. In particular, the town of Sonoma, is known  as the birthplace of American California. Agoston Haraszthy is credited  with being one of the forefathers of the California wine industry in Sonoma by his planting of grapes in the lower Arroyo Seco Creek watershed of Sonoma County.In 2017, many portions of California's Wine Country were heavily devastated by wildfires, including the October 2017 Northern California wildfires."

Zamindawar is located in the greater territory of northern Helmand and encompasses the approximate area of modern-day Baghran, Musa Qala, Naw Zad, Kajaki and Sangin districts. It was a district of hills, and of wide, well populated, and fertile valleys watered by important tributaries of the Helmand. The principal town was Musa Qala, which stands on the banks of a river of the same name, about 60 km north of the city of Grishk.This region was headquarters to the Durrani Pashtun tribe of the Alizai. The region is also home to Nurzai, Barakzai and Alakozai tribes, as well as other Durrani tribes and Kuchis. It was from Zamindawar that much of the strength of the force which besieged Kandahar under Mohammad Ayub Khan in 1880 was derived; and it was the Zamindawar contingent of tribesmen who so nearly defeated Sir Donald Stewart's force at the Battle of Ahmed Khel previously. The control of Zamindawar was regarded by the British-Indian forces as the key to the position for safeguarding the route between Herat and Kandahar during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.Zunbils ruled Zamindawar before Islamization of the area. The title Zunbil can be traced back to the Middle-Persian original Z\u016bn-d\u0101tbar, \"Zun the Justice-giver\". The geographical name Zamindawar would also reflect this, from Middle-Persian Zamin-i d\u0101tbar (Land of the Justice-giver)."

        "content": "According to author Andr\u00e9 Wink,\n\nIn southern and eastern Afghanistan, the regions of Zamindawar (Zamin I Datbar or land of the justice giver, the classical Archosia) and Zabulistan or Zabul (Jabala, Kapisha, Kia pi shi) and Kabul, the Arabs were effectively opposed for more than two centuries, from 643 to 870 AD, by the indigenous rulers the Zunbils and the related Kabul-Shahs of the dynasty which became known as the Buddhist-Shahi. With Makran and Baluchistan and much of Sindh this area can be reckoned to belong to the cultural and political frontier zone between India and Persia. It is clear however that in the seventh to the ninth centuries the Zunbils and their kinsmen the Kabulshahs ruled over a predominantly Indian rather than a Persian realm. The Arab geographers, in effect commonly speak of that king of \"Al Hind\" ...(who) bore the title of Zunbil.\nSouth of the Hindu Kush was ruled by the Zunbils, offspring of the southern-Hephthalite. The north was controlled by the Kabul Shahis. The Zunbil and Kabul Shahis were connected by culture with the neighboring Indian subcontinent. The Zunbil kings worshipped a sun god by the name of Zun from which they derived their name. For example, Andr\u00e9 Wink writes that \"the cult of Zun was primarily Hindu, not Buddhist or Zoroastrian.\"In 643 AD the non-Muslim Zunbils assembled a large army and attempted to invade Persia, which had just been Islamized, but were defeated by the Muslims. About ten years later, in 653-4 AD, Abdur Rahman bin Samara along with 6,000 Arab Muslims penetrated the Zunbil territory and made their way to the shrine of Zun in Zamindawar, which was believed to be located about three miles south of Musa Qala in today's Helmand Province of Afghanistan. The General of the Arab army \"broke of a hand of the idol and plucked out the rubies which were its eyes in order to persuade the Marzb\u0101n of S\u012bst\u0101n of the god's worthlessness.\"The Kabul Shahi ruled north of the Zunbil territory, which included Kabulistan and Gandahara. The Arabs reached Kabul with the message of Islam but were not able to rule for long. The Kabul Shahis decided to build a giant wall around the city to prevent more Arab invasions, this wall is still visible today.\n\nWillem Vogelsang in his 2002 book writes: \"During the eighth and ninth centuries AD the eastern parts of modern Afghanistan were still in the hands of non-Muslim rulers. The Muslims tended to regard them as Indians, although many of the local rulers were apparently of Hunnic or Turkic descent. Yet, the Muslims were right in so far as the non Muslim population of Eastern Afghanistan was, culturally linked to the Indian sub-continent. Most of them were either Hindus or Buddhists.\" In 870 AD the Saffarids from Zaranj conquered most of Afghanistan, establishing Muslim governors throughout the land. It is reported that Muslims and non-Muslims still lived side by side before the arrival of the Ghaznavids in the 10th century.K\u00e1bul has a castle celebrated for its strength, accessible only by one road. In it there are Musulm\u00e1ns, and it has a town, in which are infidels from Hind.\nPredominantly Indian but possessing Persian and Central Asian features was also the God Zun from which the Zunbils derived their name . \nMarqart maintained that Zunbil or Zhunbil is the correct form and Ratbil a corruption, and it was he who connected the title with the God Zun or Zhun whose temple lay in Zamindawar before the arrival of Islam, set on a sacred mountain  and still existing in the later ninth century when the Saffarid dynasty's Yaqub  and Amr b Layth conquered the area as far as Kabul.\nWith Kabul  Ghazana and Bust  as the key points between the commerce between India and Persia, Zamindawar had become an important pilgrimage center.\nIf the Hepthalites were basically Indo-European, politically and culturally the realms of  Zabul and Kabul were considered as a part of Al-Hind on the eve of Muslim conquest. The Chachnama for example contains numerous references to Zabul under the corrupt form of \u2018Ramal\u2019 or \u2018Ranmal\u2019 showing close contacts and marriage relationships  between the rulers and subordinate chiefs of  Sind and Kashmir  and the King of  Zabul  in the seventh century. The relationships between these Indian rulers on the north-western frontier appear to have been in constant flux but it seems a safe conclusion that the King of Kashmir had established a claim of suzerainty over Zabul\u2014as he had over other Indian Kings."

        "content": "The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake that struck Haiti at 16:53 local time (21:53 UTC) on Tuesday, 12 January 2010. The epicenter was near the town of L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, Ouest department, approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital.\nBy 24 January, at least 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater had been recorded. An estimated three million people were affected by the quake. Death toll estimates range from 100,000 to about 160,000 to Haitian government figures from 220,000 to 316,000, although these latter figures are a matter of some dispute. The government of Haiti estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings had collapsed or were severely damaged. Haiti's history of national debt, prejudicial trade policies by other countries, and foreign intervention into national affairs contributed to the existing poverty and poor housing conditions that increased the death toll from the disaster.The earthquake caused major damage in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel and other cities in the region. Notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building, the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, and the main jail. Among those killed were Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Joseph Serge Miot, and opposition leader Micha Gaillard. The headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), located in the capital, collapsed, killing many, including the Mission's Chief, H\u00e9di Annabi.Many countries responded to appeals for humanitarian aid, pledging funds and dispatching rescue and medical teams, engineers and support personnel. The most-watched telethon in history aired on 22 January, called \"Hope for Haiti Now,\" raising US$58 million by the next day. Communication systems, air, land, and sea transport facilities, hospitals, and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake, which hampered rescue and aid efforts; confusion over who was in charge, air traffic congestion, and problems with prioritising flights further complicated early relief work. Port-au-Prince's morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies. These had to be buried in mass graves.As rescues tailed off, supplies, medical care and sanitation became priorities. Delays in aid distribution led to angry appeals from aid workers and survivors, and looting and sporadic violence were observed. On 22 January, the United Nations noted that the emergency phase of the relief operation was drawing to a close, and on the following day, the Haitian government officially called off the search for survivors."

        "content": "The island of Hispaniola, shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic, is seismically active and has a history of destructive earthquakes.  During Haiti's time as a French colony, earthquakes were recorded by French historian Moreau de Saint-M\u00e9ry (1750\u20131819). He described damage done by an earthquake in 1751, writing that \"only one masonry building had not collapsed\" in Port-au-Prince; he also wrote that the \"whole city collapsed\" in the 1770 Port-au-Prince earthquake. Cap-Ha\u00eftien, other towns in the north of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and the Sans-Souci Palace were destroyed during an earthquake on 7 May 1842. A magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck the Dominican Republic and shook Haiti on 4 August 1946, producing a tsunami that killed 1,790 people and injured many others.Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and is ranked 149th of 182 countries on the Human Development Index. The Australian government's travel advisory site had previously expressed concerns that Haitian emergency services would be unable to cope in the event of a major disaster, and the country is considered \"economically vulnerable\" by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Haiti is no stranger to natural disasters. In addition to earthquakes, it has been struck frequently by tropical cyclones, which have caused flooding and widespread damage. The most recent cyclones to hit the island before the earthquake were Tropical Storm Fay and hurricanes Gustav, Hanna and Ike, all in the summer of 2008, causing nearly 800 deaths."

        "content": "The magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake occurred inland, on 12 January 2010 at 16:53 (UTC\u221205:00), approximately 25 km (16 mi) WSW from Port-au-Prince at a depth of 13 km (8.1 mi) on blind thrust faults associated with the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system and lasted less than 30 seconds.\n\nThere is no evidence of surface rupture; based on seismological, geological and ground deformation data, it is also thought that the earthquake did not involve significant lateral slip on the main Enriquillo fault. Strong shaking associated with intensity IX on the Modified Mercalli scale (MM) was recorded in Port-au-Prince and its suburbs. It was also felt in several surrounding countries and regions, including Cuba (MM III in Guant\u00e1namo), Jamaica (MM II in Kingston), Venezuela (MM II in Caracas), Puerto Rico (MM II\u2013III in San Juan), and the bordering Dominican Republic (MM III in Santo Domingo). According to estimates from the U.S. Geological Survey, approximately 3.5 million people lived in the area that experienced shaking intensity of MM VII to X, a range that can cause moderate to very heavy damage even to earthquake-resistant structures. Shaking damage was more severe than for other quakes of similar magnitude due to the quake's shallow depth.The quake occurred in the vicinity of the northern boundary where the Caribbean tectonic plate shifts eastwards by about 20 mm (0.79 in) per year in relation to the North American plate. The strike-slip fault system in the region has two branches in Haiti, the Septentrional-Oriente fault in the north and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault in the south; both its location and focal mechanism suggested that the January 2010 quake was caused by a rupture of the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault, which had been locked for 250 years, gathering stress. However, a study published in May 2010 suggested that the rupture process may have involved slip on multiple blind thrust faults with only minor, deep, lateral slip along or near the main Enriquillo\u2013Plantain Garden fault zone, suggesting that the event only partially relieved centuries of accumulated left-lateral strain on a small part of the plate-boundary system. The rupture was roughly 65 km (40 mi) long with mean slip of 1.8 metres (5 ft 11 in). Preliminary analysis of the slip distribution found amplitudes of up to about 4 m (13 ft) using ground motion records from all over the world.A 2007 earthquake hazard study by C. DeMets and M. Wiggins-Grandison noted that the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone could be at the end of its seismic cycle and concluded that a worst-case forecast would involve a 7.2 Mw earthquake, similar in size to the 1692 Jamaica earthquake. Paul Mann and a group including the 2006 study team presented a hazard assessment of the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system to the 18th Caribbean Geologic Conference in March 2008, noting the large strain; the team recommended \"high priority\" historical geologic rupture studies, as the fault was fully locked and had recorded few earthquakes in the preceding 40 years. An article published in Haiti's Le Matin newspaper in September 2008 cited comments by geologist Patrick Charles to the effect that there was a high risk of major seismic activity in Port-au-Prince."

        "content": "In the nights following the earthquake, many people in Haiti slept in the streets, on pavements, in their cars, or in makeshift shanty towns either because their houses had been destroyed, or they feared standing structures would not withstand aftershocks. Construction standards are low in Haiti; the country has no building codes. Engineers have stated that it is unlikely many buildings would have stood through any kind of disaster. Structures are often raised wherever they can fit; some buildings were built on slopes with insufficient foundations or steel supports. A representative of Catholic Relief Services has estimated that about two million Haitians lived as squatters on land they did not own. The country also suffered from shortages of fuel and potable water even before the disaster.President Pr\u00e9val and government ministers used police headquarters near the Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport as their new base of operations, although their effectiveness was extremely limited; several parliamentarians were still trapped in the Presidential Palace, and offices and records had been destroyed. Some high-ranking government workers lost family members, or had to tend to wounded relatives. Although the president and his remaining cabinet met with UN planners each day, there remained confusion as to who was in charge and no single group had organized relief efforts as of 16 January. The government handed over control of the airport to the United States to hasten and ease flight operations, which had been hampered by the damage to the air traffic control tower.\nAlmost immediately Port-au-Prince's morgue facilities were overwhelmed. By 14 January, a thousand bodies had been placed on the streets and pavements. Government crews collected thousands more by truck, burying them in mass graves. In the heat and humidity, corpses buried in rubble began to decompose and smell. Mati Goldstein, head of the Israeli ZAKA International Rescue Unit delegation to Haiti, described the situation as \"Shabbat from hell. Everywhere, the acrid smell of bodies hangs in the air. It's just like the stories we are told of the Holocaust \u2013 thousands of bodies everywhere. You have to understand that the situation is true madness, and the more time passes, there are more and more bodies, in numbers that cannot be grasped. It is beyond comprehension.\"Mayor Jean-Yves Jason said that officials argued for hours about what to do with the volume of corpses. The government buried many in mass graves, some above-ground tombs were forced open so bodies could be stacked inside, and others were burned. Mass graves were dug in a large field outside the settlement of Titanyen, north of the capital; tens of thousands of bodies were reported as having been brought to the site by dump truck and buried in trenches dug by earth movers. Max Beauvoir, a Vodou priest, protested the lack of dignity in mass burials, stating, \"... it is not in our culture to bury people in such a fashion, it is desecration\".\nTowns in the eastern Dominican Republic began preparing for tens of thousands of refugees, and by 16 January hospitals close to the border had been filled to capacity with Haitians. Some began reporting having expended stocks of critical medical supplies such as antibiotics by 17 January. The border was reinforced by Dominican soldiers, and the government of the Dominican Republic asserted that all Haitians who crossed the border for medical assistance would be allowed to stay only temporarily. A local governor stated, \"We have a great desire and we will do everything humanly possible to help Haitian families. But we have our limitations with respect to food and medicine. We need the helping hand of other countries in the area.\"Slow distribution of resources in the days after the earthquake resulted in sporadic violence, with looting reported. There were also accounts of looters wounded or killed by vigilantes and neighbourhoods that had constructed their own roadblock barricades. Dr Evan Lyon of Partners in Health, working at the General Hospital in Port-au-Prince, claimed that misinformation and overblown reports of violence had hampered the delivery of aid and medical services.\nFormer US president Bill Clinton acknowledged the problems and said Americans should \"not be deterred from supporting the relief effort\" by upsetting scenes such as those of looting. Lt. Gen. P.K. Keen, deputy commander of US Southern Command, however, announced that despite the stories of looting and violence, there was less violent crime in Port-au-Prince after the earthquake than before.In many neighbourhoods, singing could be heard through the night and groups of men coordinated to act as security as groups of women attempted to take care of food and hygiene necessities. During the days following the earthquake, hundreds were seen marching through the streets in peaceful processions, singing and clapping.The earthquake caused an urgent need for outside rescuers to communicate with Haitians whose main or only language is Haitian Creole. As a result, a mobile translation program to translate between English and Haitian Creole had to be written quickly.\nThe generation of waste from relief operations was referred to as a \u201csecond disaster\u201d. The United States military reported that millions of water bottles and styrofoam food packages were distributed although there was no operational waste management system. Over 700,000 plastic tarpaulins and 100,000 tents were required for emergency shelters. The increase in plastic waste, combined with poor disposal practices, resulted in open drainage channels being blocked, increasing the risk of disease."

        "content": "The earthquake struck in the most populated area of the country. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies estimated that as many as 3 million people had been affected by the quake. In mid February 2010, the Haitian government reported the death toll to have reached 230,000. However, an investigation by Radio Netherlands has questioned the official death toll, reporting an estimate of 92,000 deaths as being a more realistic figure. On the first anniversary of the earthquake, 12 January 2011, Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said the death toll from the quake was more than 316,000, raising the figures from previous estimates.Several experts have questioned the validity of the death toll numbers; Anthony Penna, professor emeritus in environmental history at Northeastern University, warned that casualty estimates could only be a \"guesstimate\", and Belgian disaster response expert Claude de Ville de Goyet noted that \"round numbers are a sure sign that nobody knows.\" Edmond Mulet, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, said, \"I do not think we will ever know what the death toll is from this earthquake\", while the director of the Haitian Red Cross, Jean-Pierre Guiteau, noted that his organization had not had the time to count bodies, as their focus had been on the treatment of survivors.While the vast majority of casualties were Haitian civilians, the dead included aid workers, embassy staff, foreign tourists\u2014and a number of public figures, including Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot, aid worker Zilda Arns and officials in the Haitian government, including opposition leader Michel \"Micha\" Gaillard. Also killed were a number of well-known Haitian musicians and sports figures, including thirty members of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Ha\u00eftienne de Football. At least 85 United Nations personnel working with MINUSTAH were killed, among them the Mission Chief, H\u00e9di Annabi, his deputy, Luiz Carlos da Costa, and police commissioner Douglas Coates. Around 200 guests were killed in the collapse of the H\u00f4tel Montana in Port-au-Prince.On 31 May 2011, an unreleased draft report based on a survey commissioned by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) challenged the Haiti earthquake death toll and several damage estimates. The unpublished report put the death toll between 46,000 and 85,000 and put the number of displaced persons at 895,000, of which only 375,000 remained in temporary shelters. The unreleased report, which compiled its figures from a door-to-door survey, was done by a Washington consulting firm, LTL Strategies. A US State Department spokesperson said the report had inconsistencies and would not be released until they were resolved. As of January 2012, USAID has not released the report and states on its website that 1.5 million people were displaced, of which 550,000 remain without permanent shelter. The most reliable academic estimate of the number of earthquake casualties in Haiti (over 95% were in the immediate Port-au-Prince area) \"within six weeks of the earthquake\" appears to be the 160,000 estimate in a 2010 University of Michigan study."

        "content": "Appeals for humanitarian aid were issued by many aid organizations, the United Nations and president Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val. Raymond Joseph, Haiti's ambassador to the United States, and his nephew, singer Wyclef Jean, who was called upon by Pr\u00e9val to become a \"roving ambassador\" for Haiti, also pleaded for aid and donations. Images and testimonials circulating after the earthquake across the internet and through social media helped to intensify the reaction of global engagement.Many countries responded to the appeals and launched fund-raising efforts, as well as sending search and rescue teams. The neighbouring Dominican Republic was the first country to give aid to Haiti, sending water, food and heavy-lifting machinery. The hospitals in the Dominican Republic were made available; a combined effort of the Airports Department (DA), together with the Dominican Naval Auxiliaries, the UN and other parties formed the Dominican-Haitian Aerial Support Bridge, making the main Dominican airports available for support operations to Haiti. The Dominican website FlyDominicanRepublic.com made available to the internet, daily updates on airport information and news from the operations center on the Dominican side. The Dominican emergency team assisted more than 2,000 injured people, while the Dominican Institute of Telecommunications (Indotel) helped with the restoration of some telephone services. The Dominican Red Cross coordinated early medical relief in conjunction with the International Red Cross. The government sent eight mobile medical units along with 36 doctors including orthopaedic specialists, traumatologists, anaesthetists, and surgeons. In addition, 39 trucks carrying canned food were dispatched, along with 10 mobile kitchens and 110 cooks capable of producing 100,000 meals per day.\nOther nations from farther afield also sent personnel, medicines, materiel, and other aid to Haiti. The first team to arrive in Port-au-Prince was ICE-SAR from Iceland, landing within 24 hours of the earthquake. A 50-member Chinese team arrived early Thursday morning. From the Middle East, the government of Qatar sent a strategic transport aircraft (C-17), loaded with 50 tonnes of urgent relief materials and 26 members from the Qatari armed forces, the internal security force (Lekhwiya), police force and the Hamad Medical Corporation, to set up a field hospital and provide assistance in Port-au-Prince and other affected areas in Haiti. A rescue team sent by the Israel Defense Forces' Home Front Command established a field hospital near the United Nations building in Port-au-Prince with specialised facilities to treat children, the elderly, and women in labor. It was set up in eight hours and began operations on the evening of 16 January. A Korean International Disaster Relief Team with 40 rescuers, medical doctors, nurses and 2 k-9s was deployed to epicenters to assist mitigation efforts of Haitian Government.\nThe American Red Cross announced on 13 January that it had run out of supplies in Haiti and appealed for public donations. Giving Children Hope worked to get much-needed medicines and supplies on the ground. Partners in Health (PIH), the largest health care provider in rural Haiti, was able to provide some emergency care from its ten hospitals and clinics, all of which were outside the capital and undamaged. MINUSTAH had over 9,000 uniformed peacekeepers deployed to the area. Most of these workers were initially involved in the search for survivors at the organization's collapsed headquarters.\nThe International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated, allowing satellite imagery of affected regions to be shared with rescue and aid organizations. Members of social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook spread messages and pleas to send help. Facebook was overwhelmed by\u2014and blocked\u2014some users who were sending messages about updates. The American Red Cross set a record for mobile donations, raising US$7 million in 24 hours when they allowed people to send US$10 donations by text messages. The OpenStreetMap community responded to the disaster by greatly improving the level of mapping available for the area using post-earthquake satellite photography provided by GeoEye, and crowdmapping website Ushahidi coordinated messages from multiple sites to assist Haitians still trapped and to keep families of survivors informed. Some online poker sites hosted poker tournaments with tournament fees, prizes or both going to disaster relief charities. Google Earth updated its coverage of Port-au-Prince on 17 January, showing the earthquake-ravaged city.\nEasing refugee immigration into Canada was discussed by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and in the US Haitians were granted Temporary protected status, a measure that permits about 100,000 illegal alien Haitians in the United States to stay legally for 18 months, and halts the deportations of 30,000 more, though it does not apply to Haitians outside the US. Local and state agencies in South Florida, together with the US government, began implementing a plan (\"Operation Vigilant Sentry\") for a mass migration from the Caribbean that had been laid out in 2003.Several orphanages were destroyed in the earthquake. After the process for the adoption of 400 children by families in the US and the Netherlands was expedited, Unicef and SOS Children urged an immediate halt to adoptions from Haiti. Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of Save the Children said: \"The vast majority of the children currently on their own still have family members alive who will be desperate to be reunited with them and will be able to care for them with the right support. Taking children out of the country would permanently separate thousands of children from their families\u2014a separation that would compound the acute trauma they are already suffering and inflict long-term damage on their chances of recovery.\" However, several organizations were planning an airlift of thousands of orphaned children to South Florida on humanitarian visas, modelled on a similar effort with Cuban refugees in the 1960s named \"Pedro Pan\". On 29 January 2010, a group of ten American Baptist missionaries from Idaho attempted to cross the Haiti-Dominican Republic border with 33 Haitian children. The group, known as the New Life Children's Refuge, did not have proper authorization for transporting the children and were arrested on kidnapping charges. The Canadian government worked to expedite around 100 adoption cases that were already underway when the earthquake struck, issuing temporary permits and waiving regular processing fees; the federal government also announced that it would cover adopted children's healthcare costs upon their arrival in Canada until they could be covered under provincially administered public healthcare plans."

        "content": "Rescue efforts began in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, with able-bodied survivors extricating the living and the dead from the rubble of the many buildings that had collapsed. Treatment of the injured was hampered by the lack of hospital and morgue facilities: the Argentine military field hospital, which had been serving MINUSTAH, was the only one available until 13 January. Rescue work intensified only slightly with the arrival of doctors, police officers, military personnel and firefighters from various countries two days after the earthquake.\nFrom 12 January, the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has been working in Haiti since 1994, focused on bringing emergency assistance to victims of the catastrophe. It worked with its partners within the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, particularly the Haitian Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The American Red Cross also spearheaded a mobile donation initiative with Mobile Accord to raise over $2 million within the first 24 hours after the earthquake.M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders; MSF) reported that the hospitals that had not been destroyed were overwhelmed by large numbers of seriously injured people. The hospitals had to perform many amputations. Running short of medical supplies, some teams had to work with any available resources, constructing splints out of cardboard and reusing latex gloves. Other rescue units had to withdraw as night fell, amid security fears. Over 3,000 people had been treated by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res as of 18 January. Ophelia Dahl, director of Partners in Health, reported, \"there are hundreds of thousands of injured people. I have heard the estimate that as many as 20,000 people will die each day that would have been saved by surgery.\"\nAn MSF aircraft carrying a field hospital was repeatedly turned away by US air traffic controllers, who had assumed control at Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport. Four other MSF aircraft were also turned away. In a 19 January press release MSF said, \"It is like working in a war situation. We don't have any more morphine to manage pain for our patients. We cannot accept that planes carrying lifesaving medical supplies and equipment continue to be turned away while our patients die. Priority must be given to medical supplies entering the country.\" First responders voiced frustration with the number of relief trucks sitting unused at the airport. Aid workers blamed US-controlled airport operations for prioritising the transportation of security troops over rescuers and supplies; evacuation policies favouring citizens of certain nations were also criticised.\nThe US military acknowledged the non-governmental organizations' complaints concerning flight-operations bias and promised improvement while noting that up to 17 January 600 emergency flights had landed and 50 were diverted; by the first weekend of disaster operations, diversions had been reduced to three on Saturday and two on Sunday. The airport staff was strengthened in order to support 100 landings a day, compared to the 35 a day that the airport gets during normal operation. A spokesman for the joint task force running the airport confirmed that, though more flights were requesting landing slots, none was being turned away.Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and French Minister of State for Cooperation Alain Joyandet criticised the perceived preferential treatment for US aid arriving at the airport. A spokesman for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the French government had not protested officially with regard to the management of the airport. US officials acknowledged that coordination of the relief effort is central to Haitian recovery. President Pr\u00e9val asked for calm coordination between assisting nations without mutual accusations.Based on US Air Force logs documenting activity at the airport, the Associated Press largely disproved the claim that the US held up aid in favor of military flights. The US military initially gave priority to military units in order to secure the airport, distribute aid, and provide security, but after that, incoming relief flights were cleared or rejected on a first-come, first-served basis. According to a US Air Force captain who had coordinated flight schedules, nearly all groups sending aid insisted their shipment was urgent. Those flights that were rejected were diverted to the Dominican Republic, and their cargoes were unloaded and taken to Haiti by land.At the peak of the relief efforts, the airport was in a state of chaos. Normally, the airport, with a single runway and 10 spaces for large planes, handled 20 flights a day. After the earthquake struck, hundreds of planes rushed to Haiti without designated landing times. On average, a plane would land or take off every two minutes. The situation was complicated by the lack of room on ramps for planes to unload their cargo, and some planes did not have enough fuel to leave.\nWhile the Port-au-Prince airport ramp has spaces for more than a dozen airliners, in the days following the quake, it sometimes served nearly 40 at once, creating serious delays. The supply backup at the airport was expected to ease as the apron management improved, and when the perceived need for heavy security diminished. Airport congestion was reduced on 18 January when the United Nations and US forces formally agreed to prioritise humanitarian flights over security reinforcement.By 14 January, more than 20 countries had sent military personnel to the country, with Canada, the United States, and the Dominican Republic providing the largest contingents. The supercarrier USS Carl Vinson arrived at maximum possible speed on 15 January with 600,000 emergency food rations, 100,000 ten-litre water containers, and an enhanced wing of 19 helicopters; 130,000 litres of drinking water were transferred to shore on the first day.The helicopter carrier USS Bataan sailed with three large dock landing ships and two survey/salvage vessels, to create a \"sea base\" for the rescue effort. They were joined by the French Navy vessel Francis Garnier on 16 January, the same day the hospital ship USNS Comfort and guided-missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill left for Haiti. Another large French vessel was later ordered to Haiti, the amphibious transport dock Siroco.\nInternational rescue efforts were restricted by traffic congestion and blocked roads. Although US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had previously ruled out dropping food and water by air as too dangerous, by 16 January, US helicopters were distributing aid by drops to areas impossible to reach by land.In Jacmel, a city of 50,000, the mayor claimed that 70 percent of the homes had been damaged and that the quake had killed 300 to 500 people and left some 4,000 injured. The small airstrip suffered damage rendering it unusable for supply flights until 20 January. The Canadian navy vessel HMCS Halifax was deployed to the area on 18 January; the Canadians joined Colombian rescue workers, Chilean doctors, a French mobile clinic, and Sri Lankan relief workers who had already responded to calls for aid.About 64,000 people living in the three adjacent agricultural communities of Durissy, Morne a Chandelle, and Les Palmes were relatively unharmed because most of the people were working in the fields when the quakes struck. All their churches, chapels, and at least 8,000 homes were destroyed.On 17 January 2010, British search and rescue teams were the first to reach L\u00e9ogane, the town at the epicenter of the quake. The Canadian ship HMCS Athabaskan reached the area on 19 January, and by 20 January some 250\u2013300 Canadian personnel were assisting relief efforts in the town. By 19 January, staff of the International Red Cross had also managed to reach the town, which they described as \"severely damaged ... the people there urgently need assistance.\" By 20 January they had reached Petit-Go\u00e2ve as well, where they set up two first-aid posts and distributed first-aid kits.\nOver the first weekend 130,000 food packets and 70,000 water containers were distributed to Haitians, as safe landing areas and distribution centers such as golf courses were secured. Nearly 2,000 rescuers had arrived from 43 different groups, with 161 search dogs; the airport had handled 250 tons of relief supplies by the end of the weekend. Reports from Sunday showed a record-breaking number of successful rescues, with at least 12 survivors pulled from Port-au-Prince's rubble, bringing the total number of rescues to 110.The buoy tender USCG Oak and USNS Grasp (T-ARS-51) were on scene by 18 January to assess damage to the port and work to reopen it, and by 21 January one pier at the Port-au-Prince seaport was functional, offloading humanitarian aid, and a road had been repaired to make transport into the city easier. In an interview on 21 January, Leo Merores, Haiti's ambassador to the UN, said that he expected the port to be fully functional again within two weeks.The US Navy listed its resources in the area as \"17 ships, 48 helicopters and 12 fixed-wing aircraft\" in addition to 10,000 sailors and Marines. The Navy had conducted 336 air deliveries, delivered 32,400 US gallons (123,000 L) of water, 532,440 bottles of water, 111,082 meals and 9,000 lb (4,100 kg) of medical supplies by 20 January. Hospital ship Comfort began operations on 20 January, completing the arrival of the first group of sea-base vessels; this came as a new flotilla of USN ships were assigned to Haiti, including survey vessels, ferries, elements of the maritime prepositioning and underway replenishment fleets, and a further three amphibious operations ships, including another helicopter carrier, USS Nassau (LHA-4).\nOn 22 January the UN and United States formalised the coordination of relief efforts by signing an agreement giving the US responsibility for the ports, airports and roads, and making the UN and Haitian authorities responsible for law and order. The UN stated that it had resisted formalising the organization of the relief effort to allow as much leeway as possible for those wishing to assist in the relief effort, but with the new agreement \"we're leaving that emergency phase behind\". The UN also urged organizations to coordinate aid efforts through its mission in Haiti to allow for better scheduling of the arrival of supplies. On 23 January the Haitian government officially called off the search for survivors, and most search and rescue teams began to prepare to leave the country. However, as late as 8 February 2010, survivors were still being discovered, as in the case of Evan Muncie, 28, found in the rubble of a grocery store.On 5 February, ten Baptist missionaries from Idaho led by Laura Silsby were charged with criminal association and kidnapping for trying to smuggle 33 children out of Haiti. The missionaries claimed they were rescuing orphaned children but investigations revealed that more than 20 of the children had been taken from their parents after they were told the children would have a better life in America. In an interview, Kenneth Merten, the United States Ambassador to Haiti, stated that the US justice system would not interfere and that \"the Haitian justice system will do what it has to do.\" By 9 March 2010, all but Silsby were deported and she remained incarcerated.Social networking organizations such as Crisis Camp Haiti were developed to aid in the structure and coordination of relief efforts in Haiti and future catastrophic events as well. By March 4, the American Red Cross, in conjunction with Mobile Accord's mGive platform, had raised a total of $50 million for victims of the Haiti earthquake. James Eberhard of Mobile Accord stated that $32.5 million of the donations came from text giving.On 10 April, due to the potential threat of mudslides and flooding from the upcoming rainy season, the Haitian government began operations to move thousands of refugees to a more secure location north of the capital."

        "content": "US President Barack Obama announced that former presidents Bill Clinton, who also acts as the UN special envoy to Haiti, and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Haiti on 16 January to survey the damage and stated that US$48 million had been raised already in the US to help Haiti recover. Following the meeting with Secretary Clinton, President Pr\u00e9val stated that the highest priorities in Haiti's recovery were establishing a working government, clearing roads, and ensuring the streets were cleared of bodies to improve sanitary conditions.US Vice President Joe Biden stated on 16 January that President Obama \"does not view this as a humanitarian mission with a life cycle of a month. This will still be on our radar screen long after it's off the crawler at CNN. This is going to be a long slog.\"\nA remake of the song \"Wavin' Flag\" by Somalian-Canadian singer K\u2019naan became a charity single in Canada, reaching number 1 on the \"Canadian Hot 100\" chart. The song was later chosen as Coca-Cola's promotional anthem for the 2010 FIFA World Cup hosted by South Africa.\nTrade and Industry Minister Josseline Colimon Fethiere estimated that the earthquake's toll on the Haitian economy would be massive, with one in five jobs lost. In response to the earthquake, foreign governments offered badly needed financial aid. The European Union promised \u20ac330 million for emergency and long-term aid. Brazil announced R$375 million for long-term recovery aid, R$25 million of which in immediate funds. The United Kingdom's Secretary of State for International Development Douglas Alexander called the result of the earthquake an \"almost unprecedented level of devastation\", and committed the UK to \u00a320 million in aid, while France promised \u20ac10 million. Italy announced it would waive repayment of the \u20ac40 million it had loaned to Haiti, and the World Bank waived the country's debt repayments for five years. On 14 January, the US government announced it would give US$100 million to the aid effort and pledged that the people of Haiti \"will not be forgotten\".\nIn the aftermath of the earthquake, the government of Canada announced that it would match the donations of Canadians up to a total of C$50 million. Canadians were able to donate through the Humanitarian Coalition which distributed funds to partner organizations working in the field. During this time the Humanitarian Coalition raised over C$15 Million. After a United Nations call for help for the people affected by the earthquake, Canada pledged an additional C$60 million in aid on 19 January 2010, bringing Canada's total contribution to C$135 million. By 8 February 2010, the federal International Co-operation Department, through the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), had already provided about C$85 million in humanitarian aid through UN agencies, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and to organizations such as CARE, M\u00e9decins du Monde, Save the Children, Oxfam Quebec, the Centre for International Studies and co-operation, and World Vision. On 23 January 2010, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that the federal government had lifted the limit on the amount of money allocated for matching individual donations to relief efforts, and that the federal government would continue to match individual donations until 12 February 2010; by the deadline, Canadians had privately raised C$220 million. On top of matching donations, International Co-operation Minister Bev Oda pledged an additional C$290 million in long-term relief to be spent between 2010 and 2012, including C$8 million in debt relief to Haiti, part of a broader cancellation of the country's overall World Bank debt. The government's commitment to provide C$550 million in aid and debt relief and Canadians' individual donations amount to a total of C$770 million.\nIn addition to Canada's federal government, the governments of several of the provinces and territories of Canada also announced that they would provide immediate emergency aid to Haiti. On 18 January 2010, the province of Quebec, whose largest city \u2013 Montreal \u2013 houses the world's largest Haitian diaspora, pledged C$3 million in emergency aid. Both the provincial government of Quebec and the Canadian federal government reaffirmed their commitment to rebuilding Haiti at the 2010 Francophonie Summit; Prime Minister Harper used his opening speech to \"tell the head of the Haitian delegation to keep up their spirits\" and to urge other nations to continue to support recovery efforts.President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal offered interested Haitians free land in Senegal; depending on how many respond to the offer, this could include up to an entire region. Around 2,000 Haitians applied for this offer. In October 2010, 163 of these applicants arrived in Senegal. They are Haitian students who were selected to continue their education in Senegal.\nPrime Minister Bellerive announced that from 20 January, people would be helped to relocate outside the zone of devastation, to areas where they may be able to rely on relatives or better fend for themselves; people who have been made homeless would be relocated to the makeshift camps created by residents within the city, where a more focused delivery of aid and sanitation could be achieved. Port-au-Prince, according to an international studies professor at the University of Miami, was ill-equipped before the disaster to sustain the number of people who had migrated there from the countryside over the past ten years to find work. After the earthquake, thousands of Port-au-Prince residents began returning to the rural towns they came from.On 25 January a one-day conference was held in Montreal to assess the relief effort and discuss further plans. Prime Minister Bellerive told delegates from 20 countries that Haiti would need \"massive support\" for its recovery from the international community. A donors' conference was expected to be held at the UN headquarters in New York in March, however, took more than three months to hold the UN conference. The 26-member international Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission, headed by Bill Clinton and Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, convened in June 2010. That committee is overseeing the US$5.3 billion pledged internationally for the first two years of Haiti's reconstruction.The commission was critiqued by Haitian groups for lacking Haitian civil society representation and accountability mechanisms. Half the representation on the commission was given to foreigners who effectively bought their seats by pledging certain amounts of money. An international development consultant contracted by the commission was quoted as saying, \"Look, you have to realize the IHRC [commission] was not intended to work as a structure or entity for Haiti or Haitians. It was simply designed as a vehicle for donors to funnel multinationals' and NGOs' project contracts.\"The Netherlands sponsored a project, called Radio555. The Dutch radio channels 3FM, Radio 538 and Radio Veronica all broadcast under the name of Radio555, funded by a contribution of \u20ac80 million.Several organizations of the US building industry and government, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the International Code Council, among others, reported that they were compiling a \"Haiti Toolkit\" coordinated by the National Institute of Building Sciences. The toolkit would comprise building technology resources and best practices for consideration by the Haitian government with the goal of creating a more resilient infrastructure to prevent future losses of life.Immediately following the earthquake, Real Medicine Foundation began providing medical staffing, in-kind medical supplies and strategic coordination to help meet the surging needs of the health crisis on the ground. Working in close partnership with other relief organizations, Real Medicine organized deployments of volunteer medical specialists to meet the needs of partner hospitals and clinics at the Haiti\u2013Dominican Republic border and in Port-au-Prince, provided direct funding, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals to local health facilities and partner hospitals, provided advisory services and coordination to local health facilities, including physical therapy support, and coordinated mobile health outreaches, field clinics and food supplies to outlying villages overlooked in the relief effort.On 15 January 2011, the Catholic Relief Services announced a US$200 million, five-year relief and reconstruction program that covers shelter, health, livelihoods, and child protection among its program areas."

Early organizational efforts were led by Bob Patterson and several Townsend-area civic organizations.  The Great Smoky Mountains Heritage Center Guild hosted fundraisers for the proposed center in 2004 and 2005.  Ground for the new center was broken in the Summer of 2004.  The center officially opened February 12, 2006.Early displays included Cherokee artifacts and masks representing the seven Cherokee clans, and tools and vehicles used by early pioneers and mountaineers.  A mountain medicine exhibit displayed bags and equipment used by Dr. Granville Dexter LeQuire, who practiced in the rural parts of the region during the first half of the 20th century.  The center's \"Tennessee on the Move\" gallery included a small car with a video screen that gave visitors the experience of driving on a mountain road in 1925. The center's outdoor displays included the Cardwell Cabin, an 1890s-era hewn log cabin donated to the center by Gatlinburg resident Wilma Maples, one of the center's benefactors.In 2008, a moonshine still built and operated by Townsend-area resident Charlie Williams (1908\u20131992) was donated to the center by Williams' son, Mike.  In 2010, the Wilders Cemetery Association donated the 100-year-old meeting house of the Wilders Chapel AME Zion Church, which had stood on Amerine Road in Maryville since 1910.The center reported over 75,000 visitors during its first three years of operation. In 2010, the center announced plans to build a new climate-controlled facility to house additional displays and artifacts.  In 2011, the Tennessee Association of Museums presented the center and its organizers with three Awards of Excellence."

Half of the main gallery is dedicated to the region's Native American history, and the other to the region's pioneer and mountaineer periods.  The center's transportation gallery interprets the region's evolving types of transportation, from wagons to railroads and automobiles.  The center also includes a 100-seat auditorium and a 500-seat amphitheater.Along with the Cardwell Cabin, Wilders Chapel, and Williams still, the outdoor section consists of nearly a dozen structures from around the region, many of which are decorated with furniture, tools, and other items from their respective periods.  The Montvale Station represents a stagecoach stop that once stood in the nearby late-19th century resort of Montvale Springs.  The center is home to two cantilever barns, a type of barn commonly used by farmers in East Tennessee, as well as a smokehouse and granary, which were once common on rural farms.  The \"setoff\" house on display is a type of home commonly found in late-19th century logging towns, such as nearby Tremont and Elkmont.The main gallery's Native American section contains artifacts dating from the Archaic (8000\u20132000 B.C.), Woodland (1000 B.C. \u2013 1000 A.D.), and Mississippian (1000\u20131600 A.D.) periods, as well as from the historic Cherokee period.  Many of the artifacts on display were uncovered during the Townsend Archaeological Project, which was conducted just up the road from 1999 to 2001.  The pioneer gallery includes late-19th and early-20th century items commonly used in rural areas around the region, including a bedroom suite, and tools such as a horseshoeing box and a banjo once played by a resident of Cades Cove.The Proffitt's Gallery, at the end of the center's main gallery, hosts traveling and temporary exhibits.  These have included an exhibit showcasing items once sold by the Alcoa-based department store, Proffitt's, a collection of Civil War memorabilia to honor the war's sesquicentennial, an exhibition of old toys, and an exhibit dedicated to Great Smoky Mountains National Park promoters and conservationists, Horace Kephart and Harvey Broome."

In July 1634, William Chadbourne, James Wall and John Goddard arrived from England aboard the ship Pied Cow with a commission to build a sawmill and gristmill  at the river's Assabumbadoc Falls.   The sawmill they built, thought to be the first over-shot water-powered site in America, was located in the \"Rocky Gorge\" below today's Brattle Street bridge.  Their sawmill was rebuilt with up to 20 saws on what was then the \"Little River\" in 1651 by Richard Leader, an engineer granted exclusive right to the water power. It was thereafter called the \"Great mill workes,\" from which the Great Works River derives its present name."

As a member of the Nazi party, he was able to profit from his connections.Horten was one of the most modern German department store companies in the 1960s and 1970s. The stores' facades, completely decorated with the so called 'horten tiles', designed by famous architect Egon Eiermann were typical landmarks within the post-war german pedestrian zones (\"Fu\u00dfg\u00e4ngerzonen\"). Many new stores were built and the traditional, long-established high street stores were renovated, modernized, and in some cases, expanded. Horten built the first department stores that included car parks and petrol stations. Horten wanted to be the department store of choice for customers from the suburbs who had their first cars and did not want to travel into the cities by bus or tram. In addition to their high-end downtown department stores, Horten built new \"edge of downtown stores.\" Every department store featured a restaurant, mostly located on the top floor. In the 1960s they were called \"KUPFERSPIESS\" (Copper Kettle). Later, Horten began to reorganise them into self-service-restaurants and called them \"Bon appetit\" or \"Horten-Restaurant,\" also combined together as \"Bon appetit: Ihr Horten-Restaurant.\" In the 1990s Horten also began introducing the Galeria-concept for its restaurants and gave them a new food distribution sector and a lighter outfit. After Kaufhof took over Horten, they merged their two restaurant companies \"Bel-Terine\" and \"Bon appetit\" into one, dubbed \"DINEA.\" Smaller restaurants with less service were called \"Grillpfanne.\"\nHorten's dark brown interiors morphed into a more modern and fresh look with the introduction of the new Galeria stores in the 1980s, with an emphasis on lighter colors such as blue, light gray and white. Some of the bigger stores added food courts called \"delikatessa\" and also added onsite supermarkets. After returning from a visit to the United States and returning with the concept, Helmut Horten opened Germany's first supermarkets in the basement floors of his department stores. They were innovative, modern, and much larger than most German grocery stores at the time.\nIn 1968 Helmut Horten sold all of his shares in the company and was not subsequently seen at celebratory occasions of Horten AG (like the 50th anniversary in 1986). Helmut Horten died in 1987, at this time his former company had been acquired by British American Tobacco plc.\nUntil 1988, Horten operated some of its department stores under the name of Merkur; some of the group's smaller department stores were called DeFaKa (Deutsches Familien Kaufhaus), but these had all been replaced with modern types of Horten department stores by the 1970s. In 1988 Horten introduced a new concept for their department stores called the \"GALERIA\" concept. This proved to be a very successful venture for Horten AG. Horten AG decided to refresh the 39 biggest stores with the GALERIA design, though this goal was never fully implemented. That year, Horten founded Horten-Extra GmbH to hold its thirteen smallest locations not branded with the new GALERIA design. Ten of these Horten-Extra stores were sold to Kaufring AG in 1993. The other three Horten-Extra stores also did not have successful histories. The location in Dortmund was closed directly after the ten Horten-Extra stores were sold; it was renovated as a mall (Westfalen Forum). The other two Horten-Extra stores became part of Kaufhof (Neuss and Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd) and traded for a few years once again as Horten, until the year 2000, when both stores closed because they were considered too small to be renamed Galeria Kaufhof.\nIn 1994 competitor Kaufhof took over Horten and - over a ten-year period - all Horten department stores were either renamed Kaufhof, sold or closed. This process ended in 2004 with the last stores being closed or renamed and the Horten name disappeared. Today only one store - the Carsch-Haus in D\u00fcssldorf - still has the Horten logo on its facade, struck in stone over the main doors. The former name \"Horten im Carsch-Haus\" was dropped in 1996. In 2008 Kaufhof cleaned the Horten stone logos and they are now clearly visible on the facade. The store now simply trades as Carsch-Haus and wasn't changed into Kaufhof. A Galeria Kaufhof store is located in the same street. The 'Carsch-Haus' in D\u00fcsseldorf was the finest department store of Horten AG and served as a flagship store. It is now run by Kaufhof, but still trades as Carsch-Haus. This store has a very interesting and unique story, as in the 1980s it was dismantled stone by stone and later rebuilt only a few feet away. This became necessary because the 'Rheinbahn' (public transport in D\u00fcsseldorf) had planned to build a subway station under the building. After rebuilding, the Carsch-Haus became Horten AG's most modern department store and a model of development for the Galeria concept.\nIn 1995 Horten AG became a real estate company and leased the Horten stores to Kaufhof. The operating business was transferred to the Horten GALERIA GmbH, which was later merged with Kaufhof AG."

Yimpas was very hard to continue to be attractive for German customers and employed many German workers, in addition, there were also Turkish-born workers. By 2003 Yimpas had changed the supply of goods so much, that they were no longer possible to run the department store under the brand name Horten, the brand was still in use by Kaufhof for other stores in Germany. After the name change, however, remained more and more German customers away because Yimpas as a department store was previously unknown. The customers preferred the Kaufhof department store, which is just a few steps away. The proximity between the department stores, was also the reason for the sale of the house. The branch in Hamm was being considered for conversion into a Galeria Horten by the end of the 1990s. In spring 2004, the department store section closed and only the yimpas-supermarket in the basement remained open, but this was too expensive for Yimpas. By the end of 2004, also the supermarkt was closed. The house was locked up for over two years and then it was reopened for one day a week before its break for a farewell party.

On its spot, a new stone castle was erected in 1335 and a small settlement grew up around it. The ruins of this fortress are still visible and are in the process of being restored. The original church was constructed in 1495, and eventually, the fortress developed into a trading post. In the 17th century, a watermill, sawmill, a cardigan mill, and a vinegar-works were constructed during the reign of duke Jacob Kettler. In 1927, the Jelgava\u2013Liep\u0101ja Railway connected the city to other important towns and a period of development resulted."

        "content": "The East\u2013West Highway FT4 was opened to traffic on 1 July 1982. The construction of the highway was one of the largest projects undertaken by the JKR and its completion adds to the large mileage of roads in the country providing necessary access to new areas and the infrastructure for development works. The construction of the first phase of the highway was carried out by JKR workers, while the bridges and some of the ancillary works were carried out through contractors; during the second phase, the entire construction job was done by contractors.\nBefore East\u2013West Highway was built, the journey from Alor Star to Kota Bharu may reach over 1,000 kilometres (621 mi), but the highway shortens the distance by 671 kilometres (417 mi). The highway includes Lake Temenggor Bridge which crosses Lake Temenggor, a hydroelectric dam and Pulau Banding, an artificial island.\nThe East\u2013West Highway is one of the more scenic routes in Peninsular Malaysia, due to its hilly nature. The highway passes through two major mountain ranges, namely the Bintang Range and the Titiwangsa Range. As one enters the highway, the Titiwangsa Range through which the highway traverses comes into view in the distant. Traveling along the gentle curves one climbs higher and sees on either side the primary jungle rich with timber. As one proceeds, the jungle gives way to the huge artificial Lake Temenggor at Banding. Halfway along the highway the elevation of the road is over 1,100 m (3,600 ft) above sea level and the weather cool and pleasant. There are places where road signs are put up to warn motorists of elephants crossing the road, as there is no dedicated grade-separated animal crossing provided.\nWhile the highway was constructed as an entirely new route (except the former Perak State Route A171 section from Gerik to Kuala Rui that formed the pioneer route of the highway), the construction of the second phase involved acquisitions of several roads, namely Kedah State Route K171 (Kampung Sadek\u2013Kampung Hangus), Kedah State Route K173 (Kampung Hangus\u2013Kampung Kuala Kuang), Jalan Kampung Keda Kemangi (Kampung Kuala Kuang\u2013Kampung Keda Kemangi), and Jalan Sungai Petani\u2013Baling FT67 (Kupang\u2013Kuala Pegang and Kuala Pegang\u2013Tawar). As a result, the East\u2013West Highway FT4 overlaps with Kedah State Route K171 (from Kampung Sadek to Kampung Hangus) and Jalan Sungai Petani\u2013Baling FT67.As the section of the highway from Kulim to Kupang was constructed back to back with the Butterworth\u2013Kulim Expressway E15 and overlaps with the FT67 road, some maps incorrectly label the highway as either FT67 or E15. However, both route codes are incorrect, as the Sungai Seluang\u2013Tawar section is not an expressway-standard road. The FT4 route code was only applied after the final section from Titi Karangan to Gerik was completed in 2005.The completion of the highway will reduce transport costs and with this the state of Kelantan can expect its tempo of development to be heightened, new towns and industrial areas will be developed. The highway will provide the access for the extraction of timber from the jungles along the road and help boost tourism among Malaysians as well as foreigners.\nThr highway is one of dangerous routes in malaysia due to condition of roads causing many record of traffic collision and natural disaster."

The bridges were designed by ENEX of New Zealand under the Colombo Plan Aid. Construction of three of the bridges were undertaken by a foreign contractor while a joint venture between two local firms undertook the construction of the remaining two bridges. In addition to the above, there are about 280 culverts constructed mainly by departmental workers.\nConstructing the highway was challenging for the JKR. There were many constraints, which slowed down progress. Some 27.5 million cubic metres of earth was required to be cut to construct the highway, of this over 3.8 million cubic metres was rock, which required drilling and blasting operations for its removal. Hill cuts of over 60 m (200 ft) and valleys over 100 m (330 ft) deep, which required filling, was found at many locations. The intensity of the monsoon rains especially in the forward areas reduced time available for construction to 10 months in a year. The East\u2013West Highway is located close to the Malaysia\u2013Thailand border and is situated in a Security Area. As a result, several measures had to be taken and procedures adopted to ensure the safety of the workers and the machines. These too contributed to some delay. The 116-kilometre-long (72 mi) highway, which links the East Coast at Jeli, Kelantan with the West Coast at Gerik, Perak cost RM 396 million. Other details of the project are as follows:"

It is located in the Municipio de Tem\u00f3sachic at an altitude of 1,780 meters (5,840 ft) in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Many of the people of the region are members of the indigenous ethnic group called Mountain Pima or the Pima Bajo. They are related to the Pima and Papago (Tohono O'odham) of Arizona and northern Sonora, speaking a similar but distinct language.Most maps give the name as Yep\u00e1chic, but the citizens in the town and the road signs in the vicinity spell it Yepachi. The population in 2010 was officially listed as 851, but this number swells to a few thousand on the holidays when people from small hamlets in the surrounding region congregate in Yep\u00e1chic.\nSome of the flatter regions have been cleared for farming. The people of the region plant maize, beans, squash, potatoes, and various other crops. They also raise cattle, goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and other livestock. The local people eat most of the crops themselves, but most of the cattle raised is sold to buyers from the lowlands. There is also lumbering in the region, a needed source of income for the people of the area."

The rugged terrain had prevented Spanish attempts at pacification of the region before that date. The old mission church built in Yep\u00e1chic is still in use today, the only such mission church still standing in the region.\nYep\u00e1chic was affected in the 17th century by anti-Spanish uprisings by the Tarahumara to the south, and later in the 19th century by Apache raids from the north. The town was briefly abandoned several times because of these conflicts.As recently as the 1890s, virtually all the residents of Yep\u00e1chic were of Pima heritage. In more recent decades, mestizos from the Mexican lowlands have migrated into the area, and now own most of the homes and nearly all the shops in the center of town. Pima continue to inhabit outlying areas.The region continued to be isolated and largely untouched by the outside world through the middle of the 20th century. There was no road into the area until the 1930s, when a primitive dirt road was built. A much better gravel road replaced this in the 1970s, crossing the mountains and allowing traffic to cross the mountains for the first time. This road was paved in 1990, resulting in regular bus service and a large amount of commercial trucking between Chihuahua and Hermosillo passing through the Pima region."

People locate the graves of lost relatives, clean the weeds off them, and decorate them with flowers, crosses and candles.

Historically, Bosnia and Herzegovina has managed multiple play-off appearances and has qualified for one FIFA World Cup. More often than not, the team produces solid results in qualifiers and challenges for a top spot.\nFrom 1920 to 1992, the players lined up for Yugoslavia, but following the outbreak of the Bosnian War and subsequent independence, a new football nation arose from the ashes.\nThe early period saw Bosnia and Herzegovina have to wait until the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers to compete for a place in a major competition. Bosnia and Herzegovina finished fourth in a group that included Greece, Denmark, Croatia and Slovenia. This was then subsequently followed by further disappointment with lackluster campaigns in the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifiers, as well as the 2002 FIFA World Cup.This early period was followed by Bosnia and Herzegovina coming very close to qualifying directly for their first ever major competition, UEFA Euro 2004, narrowly missing out by a single goal against Denmark.Bosnia and Herzegovina failed to make the grade in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, despite being unbeaten at home, and the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers, which saw their poor home form cost them. Bosnia and Herzegovina then experienced double heartbreak, bowing out twice in the playoffs to Portugal, first 2\u20130 on aggregate in the 2010 FIFA World Cup decider and then 6\u20132 on aggregate in the UEFA Euro 2012 decider.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, hosted by Brazil, in October 2013 by beating Lithuania, finally breaking their curse and participating in a major tournament.They managed to finish third in a group which included Argentina, and tasted their first victory thanks to a 3\u20131 win over Iran. Nigeria pipped Bosnia and Herzegovina for second place in the group with a 1\u20130 win marred with controversy following an incorrectly disallowed goal scored by Edin D\u017eeko in the first half.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina finished third in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers behind Belgium and Wales. After making an unfortunate start to the qualifiers with a surprise 2\u20131 home defeat against Cyprus and managing just two points through four games, manager Safet Su\u0161i\u0107 was dismissed and replaced by Mehmed Ba\u017edarevi\u0107.After the slow start, Bosnian performance improved dramatically, with five wins in their remaining six matches, including victories over Wales and Israel along with three clean sheets. However, they ultimately failed to qualify after a two legged playoff encounter with the Republic of Ireland. Bosnia and Herzegovina failed to make back-to-back FIFA World Cups after failing to qualify to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nBosnia and Herzegovina finished fourth in their UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying group with the manager Robert Prosine\u010dki, missing out on direct qualification. However, they qualified for the playoffs by winning their UEFA Nations League group, and with new manager Du\u0161an Bajevi\u0107, they ultimately missed out on yet another Euro after losing to Northern Ireland on penalties.\nFollowing several years of disappointment, Bulgarian Ivaylo Petev was named as Bosnia and Herzegovina's new manager, marking the first time a Bosnia and Herzegovina manager was not from the former Yugoslavia. In their first campaign under Petev, Bosnia and Herzegovina were drawn into a group with 2018 FIFA World Cup champions France and kept their chances of qualification alive until the final two matches; ultimately failing to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup."

Established as the Jesuit Academy of Kolozsv\u00e1r in present-day Cluj-Napoca in 1581, the institution was re-established as a university in 1872 by Emperor Franz Joseph I. The university relocated to Szeged in 1921, making it one of the oldest research universities in Hungary. It went through numerous changes throughout the 20th century and was eventually divided into distinct independent universities.\nThe current University of Szeged was formed in 2000 and is made up of twelve constituent faculties and nineteen doctoral schools, which consist of a range of departments and research groups. Each faculty functions autonomously. In addition to these, the university also operates the Health Centre of the University of Szeged, an extensive teaching hospital responsible for public regional healthcare, and three laboratory schools, which combine public education and teacher training responsibilities. The faculties and associated buildings do not form one single campus, as the buildings are scattered around downtown Szeged, although the Health Centre and the buildings of the Department of Arts are adjacent to each other. Being part of the Bologna zone, most majors are divided into a Bachelor's and Master's and PhD programmes, but the so-called one tyre-master (undivided) programmes are also.The university also operates the Klebelsberg Library, the largest university library in Central Europe, and six university presses. In the fiscal year of 2014, the university had an operating budget of US$220 million. The University of Szeged has educated a large number of notable alumni, including Nobel laureates Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi and Katalin Karik\u00f3, political scientist Istv\u00e1n Bib\u00f3, and poets Attila J\u00f3zsef and Gyula Juh\u00e1sz."

The building houses the Klebelsberg Library, the Career Centre, the Students' Service Office, and many study spaces. The university also has ten dormitories for Hungarian and international students. Other buildings and sites affiliated with the University of Szeged include the Biological Research Centre, the ELI-ALPS Research Institute and the Health Centre.\nThe SZTE Botanic Garden is a 24-acre garden outside the city centre and is home to more than 40 protected species whose natural habitats are only found in Hungary. Primarily a research garden, its main purpose is to maintain its rose garden, rock garden and taxonomical collection, and to organise science lessons."

For his activities in the Rebellion, his house was destroyed and he was banished from Upper Canada. Gibson fled to nearby western New York, settling with his family in Lockport. Although he was threatened with losing his land, he continued to own the property in what was then York County, near Toronto. His wife was not banished, and she was able to travel between Lockport and Toronto to collect rents and profits on the farmstead.\n\nIn 1843, Gibson was pardoned, along with many who took part in the Rebellion. He returned with his family to York County in 1848 and built this house in 1851. Its style reflects a prosperous man, and some of its furniture and engravings reflect his U.S. residence in the motif.\nGibson House is set back from Yonge Street, one of the colony's pioneer roads and today often called the world's longest street. It is shielded from traffic, however, by construction hoarding for the Gibson Square Condominium development. Gibson House once welcomed carriages to its front door, now shielded from Yonge Street by construction. The house is one of the several museums operated by the City of Toronto.\nGibson established an apple orchard on the property in 1832, of which one tree remains at the corner of Yonge Street and Park Home Ave. The orchard (and the remaining tree) produce Tolman Sweet apples. In 2016, the tree was selected as a winner in a local survey of Toronto trees as a \"Survivor\". Grafts from it have been used to propagate the species."

Founded in 2003 by then 19-year-old Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos raised more than US$700 million from venture capitalists and private investors, resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014. The company claimed that it had devised blood tests that required very small amounts of blood and that could be performed rapidly and accurately, all using compact automated devices that the company had developed. These claims were proven to be false.A turning point came in 2015, when medical research professor John Ioannidis, and later professor of clinical biochemistry Eleftherios Diamandis, along with investigative journalist John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal, questioned the validity of Theranos's technology. The company faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others. By June 2016, Forbes estimated that Holmes's personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to \"nothing\". After several years of struggle, lawsuits, and sanctions from CMS, what remained of the company was dissolved in September 2018.Theranos, Holmes and former company president Sunny Balwani were charged with fraud by the SEC in 2018. Holmes and Balwani were also charged with wire fraud and conspiracy, with Holmes being found guilty on four counts in January 2022 and sentenced that November to 11 years and 3 months in prison. Balwani was convicted on all 12 counts brought against him in July 2022, and in December 2022 was sentenced to 12 years and 11 months in prison and 3 years of probation."

She started developing lab-on-a-chip technology for blood tests, with the idea to start a company that would make blood tests cheaper, more convenient and accessible to consumers. Holmes dropped out of Stanford in 2003 and used the education trust from her parents to found the company that would later be called Theranos, derived from a combination of the words \"therapy\" and \"diagnosis\". The company's original name was \"Real-Time Cures\", which Holmes changed after deciding that too many people were skeptical of the word \"cure\"."

        "content": "Theranos claimed to have developed devices to automate and miniaturize blood tests using microscopic blood volumes. Theranos dubbed its blood collection vessel the \"nanotainer\" and its analysis machine the \"Edison\". Holmes reportedly named the device \"Edison\" after inventor Thomas Edison, stating, \"We tried everything else and it failed, so let's call it the Edison.\" This was likely because of a well-known Edison quote: \"I've not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.\"The blood sample was to be collected via a finger prick and then transferred to the nanotainer through Theranos's sample collection device. At just 12.9 millimetres (0.51 in) in height, the nanotainer held a couple of drops of blood.One of the patents for the Edison described a point of care system that could communicate with the Internet to receive instructions for which blood tests to run on the samples, before communicating these results back through the Internet. The results would then be compared to medical data available on the Internet, with the Edison running supplementary blood tests that were more targeted based on the results of the comparison. The patent was unclear on how much blood the Edison would actually require to conduct these blood tests. In one section, the patent claimed the sample needed to consist of about 10 drops of blood, but in another section, the patent claimed the Edison would need less than one drop of blood. The technology was criticized for not being peer reviewed. Theranos claimed to have data verifying the accuracy and reliability of its tests that would be published. In February 2016, Theranos announced that it would permit the Cleveland Clinic to complete a validation study of its technology. In March 2016, a study authored by 13 scientists appeared in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, where it was stated that the company's blood test results were flagged \"outside their normal range 1.6\u00d7 more often than other testing services\", that 68 percent of lab measurements evaluated \"showed significant interservice variability\", and that \"lipid panel test results between Theranos and other clinical services\" were \"nonequivalent\".In August 2016 the company introduced a new robotic capillary blood testing unit named \"miniLab\" at the 2016 annual meeting of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, but did not present any data supporting the claimed abilities of the device. The miniLab was allegedly capable of carrying out a range of tests from a small amount of blood. After Theranos failed to address concerns that it exaggerated the capabilities of the miniLab, Walgreens withdrew from their partnership. It was later revealed that Theranos had voided two years of test results showing inaccuracies with the Edison technology."

On March 13, 2008, just hours before he was scheduled to see a lawyer, Li Guofu was found hanged. Although his death was deemed a suicide, media reported that Li Guofu's body was bruised and his mouth was tightly shut, uncharacteristic of a suicide by hanging.

In 1645 their first school was founded through the generosity of Edmund Kirwan. While the language of the classroom was Latin, only the Jesuits with a fluent command of Irish were sent on the \"Irish Mission\".The school, which was incorporated into a Jesuit residence in the present Abbeygate Street, continued in Galway through a time of political upheaval and military activity.In 1859, at the request of the Bishop of Galway, John McEvilly, the Jesuits once more took up residence in the city, this time in Prospect Hill and served in the nearby St. Patrick's Church. Within a year they had opened a college near the site of the present Bank of Ireland at 19 Eyre Square. The college's present location on Sea Road dates from 1863, when it was built the same year as the Jesuit church next door, St Ignatius Church.The modern phase of Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id began in 1929. The local enthusiasm for the language revival efforts of the emerging Republic of Ireland was to be served by a re-invigorated Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id, which became an Irish-medium School in 1931.In 1967, in contrast with its foundation of 1620, Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id became part of the \"non-fee-paying\" secondary school system. In 1969, with the co-operation of management and staff, coupled with the help of parents, past pupils, and friends of the Jesuits, the present main school building, the Griffin Building, was built.In 1974, when the school population was increased to provide three-form entry, one co-educational form became the Irish-medium Scoil Gaeilge. Following consultation with staff and Jesuits, the school established the Board of Management in 1980 to take shared responsibility for all aspects of the school \u2013 the first agreed board of its kind in Ireland.In 1982, the school underwent a buildings programme. This produced a new science block (O\u2019Reilly Building), a refurbished classroom block (Andrews Building), a library, and art, computer, and co-educational facilities. The Colombian Hall was refurbished and an indoor sports area was added. Co-education was extended to the whole school in 1984, to become the first fully co-educational secondary school in the city.The senator P\u00e1draig \u00d3 C\u00e9idigh taught at Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id for a time."

A population charter was granted in 1154, bestowing a number of privileges to the Gascon settlers. It was effectively transferred to Archbishop Cerebruno in 1176, hereby becoming a seigneurial dominion of the Mitre of Toledo. In the 14th century, the inhabitants sought to free themselves from the ecclesiastical yoke, which was however confirmed by the Crown in 1329, although the monarch retained control over the morer\u00eda and the juder\u00eda. The town was sacked in 1441. By the 15th century, Illescas was a walled town that enjoyed an important marketplace and levied a gate tax (from which Madrilenians were exempted). It was incorporated to the Crown in May 1575, hereby becoming a realengo town ('royal demesne').The town gained a railway link in 1876.\nThe town's population experienced a steady growth throughout the 20th century. Population boomed in the first two decades of the 21st century, roughly increasing threefold. Thanks to the location, communications and available land, Illescas became a major logistics centre in Spain by the early 21st century."

First exhibits included architectural fragments of the demolished St. Mary's Cathedral and two monasteries.\nThe main building at Holstenwall was designed by Fritz Schumacher and constructed between 1914 and 1922. The museum was built on the site of the former Bastion Henricus, a part of the baroque fortification which was erected between 1616 and 1625 by the Dutchman Jan van Valckenborgh in order to make the town impregnable.\nThe museum's courtyard was damaged during the Great fire of Hamburg in 1842 and fully restored in 1995. A glass dome over the inner courtyard was completed in 1989. The glass courtyard was completed by the firm of Von Gerkan, Marg and Partners. This provided more museum space without an actual new building, because it allowed increased use of the courtyard. The covered courtyard was actually envisioned, or at least considered, as part of the original design, however the construction of the covering was deferred. The design uses a steel gridshell.The Hamburg Observatory occupied the museum's current site from 1825 to 1912 before being moved to Bergedorf. The area was part of the old city wall defences built by the Dutchman Jan van Valckenborgh. These walls were part of Bastion Henricus, which was a baroque fortification built between 1616 and 1625. The museum was formerly located at the Johanneum school.\nThe museum became state-owned under the direction of Otto Lauffer in the early 1900s, though this was changed back in 1999.\nThe museum adopted the name hamburgmuseum, and initials hm, in 2006. In 2008, the museum started a program called hm freunde (Society of Friends of the Museum for Hamburg History).\nIn 2010, a pirate skull with a nail in it was stolen from the museum. The skull was discovered in 1878, and forensic analysis believes it to be from the 1400s. At that time, it was common for pirates to be executed by being beheaded, and then the skull would be put on an iron stake to display the consequences of this activity. A more precise determination was attempted by the museum in 2004 by DNA analysis, but there was no further confirmation. It was thought this might be from a particular execution of 30 during the age of the Hanseatic League. The skull was stolen on January 9, 2010, and it was thought it may be the skull of (in)famous pirate Klaus Stoertebeker.\nThe skull was added to the museum's collection in 1922.In 2016, the museum was considered as a candidate for repatriation of a century old German dog-tag. The dog-tag belonged to a soldier that had gone missing in action during World War I."

The altarpiece, dated 1674, is rather unsophisticated baroque although the scenes in the central panel of the Last Supper and the Resurrection are somewhat earlier. The pulpit in the auricular style (c. 1650) presents cartouches of Faith, Hope and Charity.Investigations in 1908 revealed frescos in the chancel and apsis from two periods, c. 1300 and c. 1400. The latter are mostly well preserved with scenes from the Creation including images of Adam and Eve, the Judgment of Christ as well as several dragons."

        "content": "In 1943 the Royal Navy commissioned six light aircraft carriers in an effort to counter the German and Japanese navies. The 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier, commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was the result. Serving with eight navies between 1944 and 2001, these ships were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards as an intermediate step between the full-sized fleet aircraft carriers and the less expensive but limited-capability escort carriers.Sixteen light fleet carriers were ordered, and all were laid down as what became the Colossus class in 1942 and 1943. The final six ships were modified during construction to handle larger and faster aircraft, and were re-designated the Majestic class. The improvements from the Colossus class to the Majestic class included heavier displacement, armament, catapult, aircraft lifts and aircraft capacity. Construction on the ships was suspended at the end of World War II, as the ships were surplus to the Royal Navy's peacetime requirements. \nInstead, the carriers were modernized and sold to several Commonwealth nations. The ships were similar, but each varied depending on the requirements of the country to which the ship was sold.HMS Hercules, the fifth ship in the Majestic class, was ordered on 7 August 1942 and laid down on 14 October 1943 by Vickers-Armstrongs at High Walker on the River Tyne. After World War II ended with Japan's surrender on 2 September 1945, she was launched on 22 September, and her construction was suspended in May 1946. At the time of suspension, she was 75 per cent complete. Her hull was preserved, and in May 1947 she was laid up in Gareloch off the Clyde. In January 1957, she was purchased by India and was towed to Belfast to complete her construction and modifications by Harland & Wolff. Several improvements to the original design were ordered by the Indian Navy, including an angled deck, steam catapults, and a modified island."

        "content": "Vikrant displaced 16,000 t (15,750 long tons) at standard load and 19,500 t (19,200 long tons) at deep load. She had an overall length of 700 ft (210 m), a beam of 128 ft (39 m) and a mean deep draught of 24 ft (7.3 m). She was powered by a pair of Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two propeller shafts, using steam provided by four Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of 40,000 indicated horsepower (30,000 kW) which gave a maximum speed of 25 knots (46 km/h; 29 mph). Vikrant carried about 3,175 t (3,125 long tons) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 12,000 nmi (22,000 km; 14,000 mi) at 14 knots (26 km/h; 16 mph), and 6,200 mi (10,000 km) at 23 knots (43 km/h; 26 mph). The air and ship crew comprised 1,110 officers and men.The ship was armed with sixteen 40-millimetre (1.6 in) Bofors anti-aircraft guns, but these were later reduced to eight. At various times, its aircraft consisted of Hawker Sea Hawk and STOVL BAe Sea Harrier jet fighters, Sea King Mk 42B and HAL Chetak helicopters, and Breguet Br.1050 Aliz\u00e9 anti-submarine aircraft. The carrier fielded between 21 and 23 aircraft of all types. Vikrant's flight decks were designed to handle aircraft up to 24,000 lb (11,000 kg), but 20,000 lb (9,100 kg) remained the heaviest landing weight of an aircraft. Larger 54 by 34 feet (16.5 by 10.4 m) lifts were installed.The ship was equipped with one LW-05 air-search radar, one ZW-06 surface-search radar, one LW-10 tactical radar and one Type 963 aircraft landing radar with other communication systems."

        "content": "The Indian Navy's first aircraft carrier was commissioned as INS Vikrant on 4 March 1961 in Belfast by Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, the Indian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. The name Vikrant was derived from the Sanskrit word vikr\u0101nta meaning \"stepping beyond\", \"courageous\" or \"bold\". Captain Pritam Singh Mahindroo was the first commanding officer of the ship. Two squadrons were to be embarked on the \nship - INAS 300, commanded by Lieutenant Commander B. R. Acharya which had British Hawker Sea Hawk fighter-bombers and INAS 310, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Mihir K. Roy which had French Aliz\u00e9 anti-submarine aircraft. On 18 May 1961, the first jet landed on her deck. It was piloted by Lieutenant Radhakrishna Hariram Tahiliani, who later served as admiral and Chief of the Naval Staff of India from 1984 to 1987. Vikrant formally joined the Indian Navy's fleet in Bombay (now Mumbai) on 3 November 1961, when she was received at Ballard Pier by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.In December of that year, the ship was deployed for Operation Vijay (the code name for the annexation of Goa) off the coast of Goa with two destroyers, INS Rajput and INS Kirpan. Vikrant did not see action, and patrolled along the coast to deter foreign interference. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Vikrant was in dry dock refitting, and did not see any action.In June 1970, Vikrant was docked at the Naval Dockyard, Bombay, due to many internal fatigue cracks and fissures in the water drums of her boilers that could not be repaired by welding. As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further notice. On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.The ship began preliminary sea trials on 18 March and returned two days later. Trials were again conducted on 26\u201327 April. The navy decided to limit the boilers to a pressure of 400 pounds per square inch (2,800 kPa) and the propeller revolutions to 120 RPM ahead and 80 RPM astern, reducing the ship's speed to 14 knots (26 km/h; 16 mph). With the growing expectations of a war with Pakistan in the near future, the navy started to transfer its ships to strategically advantageous locations in Indian waters. The primary concern of Naval Headquarters about the operation was the serviceability of Vikrant. When asked his opinion regarding the involvement of Vikrant in the war, Fleet Operations Officer Captain Gulab Mohanlal Hiranandani told the Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Sardarilal Mathradas Nanda:\n\n...during the 1965 war Vikrant was sitting in Bombay Harbour and did not go out to sea. If the same thing happened in 1971, Vikrant would be called a white elephant and naval aviation would be written off. Vikrant had to be seen being operational even if we didn't fly any aircraft.\nNanda and Hiranandani proved to be instrumental in taking Vikrant to war. There were objections that the ship might have severe operational difficulties that would expose the carrier to increased danger on operations. In addition, the three Daphne-class submarines acquired by the Pakistan Navy posed a significant risk to the carrier. In June, extensive deep sea trials were carried out, with steel safety harnesses around the three boilers still operational. Observation windows were fitted as a precautionary measure, to detect any steam leaks. By the end of June, the trials were complete and Vikrant was cleared to participate on operations, with its speed restricted to 14 knots."

On 3 December 2013, the Indian government decided to auction the ship. The Bombay High Court dismissed a public-interest lawsuit filed by Kiran Paigankar to stop the auction, stating the vessel's dilapidated condition did not warrant her preservation, nor were the necessary funds or government support available.In January 2014, the ship was sold through an online auction to a Darukhana ship-breaker for \u20b960 crore (US$7.5 million). The Supreme Court of India dismissed another lawsuit challenging the ship's sale and scrapping on 14 August 2014. Vikrant remained beached off Darukhana in Mumbai Port while awaiting the final clearances of the Mumbai Port Trust. On 12 November 2014, the Supreme Court gave its final approval for the carrier to be scrapped, which commenced on 22 November 2014.On 7 April 2022, an FIR against an ex-MP Kirit Somaiya, his son Neil, and others was registered, on charges of alleged cheating and criminal breach of trust linked to the collection of funds up to Rs. 57 crore for restoring the decommissioned aircraft carrier INS Vikrant. The Trombay Police booked them under Section 420 (cheating and dishonesty including delivery of property) and Section 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and Section 34 (common intentions) of the Indian Penal Code.\nAccording to the complaint, the father and son duo collected the money in 2013-14 in the name of restoring Vikrant, but the funds collected were spent on personal use.\nSomaiya was leading the front of attacking the government's intent of commercializing the decommissioned ship by handing it to private players."

In 1948, a distant section of Jacques-Cartier (with no boundaries to the rest of the town) went on to form an independent municipality under the name of Pr\u00e9ville. In 1949, Jacques-Cartier lost another portion of its territory which became Ville LeMoyne. Originally incorporated as a town, Jacques-Cartier gained the status of city in 1952.\nJacques-Cartier grew extremely quickly, much too fast for its existing infrastructure. It lacked a sewer system and paved roads. Dogs ran wildly in the streets. Houses were built as soon as the owner had the materials required to make one. The city had few or no laws on architectural integrity. This led to a mishmash of buildings, some of concrete, some of wood, some of brick, along its streets.\nJacques-Cartier merged with the city of Longueuil in 1969. Although the territory of Jacques-Cartier was by far larger than that of Longueuil, it was the latter's name that was retained because of historic reasons (Longueuil was a much older city than Jacques-Cartier).Today, the western part of what used to be Jacques-Cartier is primarily low-income, highly populated, retail-oriented and completely built-up. The architecture in this area can be defined as a mishmash and non-uniform, as buildings were usually constructed when the property owners had enough money to build them. The eastern part, on the other hand, tends to be the opposite. It is by far less densely populated than its western counterpart and contains the industrial section of Longueuil. Recently built designer mansions and condominiums are plentiful (notably in the Collectivit\u00e9-Nouvelle and Parcours du Cerf neighbourhoods), and the area is becoming increasing built up. The far northeast known as the Fatima neighbourhood (which borders the city of Boucherville) is similar to the western part, with many bungalows and apartment buildings dating from Jacques-Cartier.\nDuring its 22 years of existence, Jacques-Cartier gave birth to some of the most well-known establishments of Le Vieux-Longueuil borough; notably Coll\u00e8ge \u00c9douard-Montpetit (1967), G\u00e9rard-Fillion secondary school (1966), and the current location of Pratt & Whitney Canada (1951)."

Since this region was a source for obsidian blades, these images may reflect some aspects of daily life during the 7th-6th millenniums BC. Other wall paintings at this site depict birds consuming flesh from headless bodies. These scenes may reflect Near Eastern practices of the preparation of corpses for burial. The separate archaeological finds of heads and bodies buried under rooms may also indicate the performance of this ritual. Another wall painting found at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, and now on display at the Anatolian Civilizations Museum in Ankara, may be the world's oldest map. It shows a series of rectangles that may depict houses, and a possible profile drawing of a local volcanic mountain. Fragments of white plaster colored with red ochre at the later site called Can Hasan indicate that wall painting in Anatolia continued into the Chalcolithic Period."

Either the old church was torn down and a new rectangular stone church was constructed on the site, or (more likely), the original stone church was enlarged by expanding the size of the original choir. Regardless, after about 1300, the church was a rectangular church made out of stone. in 1687\u20131688, the whole roof and the church porch were repaired. In 1724, during the Norwegian church sale, the church was sold by the Crown to Lieutenant Colonel Hans Fredrik Green to pay for the debt from the Great Northern War.In 1814, this church served as an election church (Norwegian: valgkirke). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway's first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called \"electors\" who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet in Eidsvoll later that year.In 1854, the privately owned church was sold back to the parish. At that time, the old church was deemed to be small and in poor condition so it was decided that they would tear down the old church and rebuild. The architect Andreas Gr\u00f8nning was hired to design the new church, and soon after he completed the drawings in 1854, he died, so Frederick Hannibal Stockfleth from Bergen oversaw of the construction. Just after Pentecost in 1855, the old church was torn down. Work on the new church was carried out from 1855 to 1857. The new stone church was completed in 1857 and it was consecrated on 6 September 1857. In 1955\u20131957, the church was restored and remodeled under the direction of the architect Torgeir Alvsaker."

Pope Innocent VI ordered 20 casks of wine from there in 1357 and Henry IV of France and Louis XIV served them regularly at court, where they were called simple Rh\u00f4ne wine. In the mid-17th century the right-bank district of the C\u00f4te du Rh\u00f4ne had issued regulations to govern the quality of its wine and in 1737 the king ordered that casks of Lirac wine shipped from the nearby river port of Roquemaure should be branded with the letters CDR to introduce a system of protecting its origin. The rules for its C\u00f4te du Rh\u00f4ne thus formed the very early basis of today's nationwide AOC system governed by the INAO. Production was very high in those days: in 1774 the vintage yielded more than 8000 hl. of wine. In 1863 phylloxera arrived in Lirac. In fact, a winemaker at Ch\u00e2teau de Clary may have been responsible for introducing it.\nThe name was changed to C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne when the left-bank wines were included in the appellation some hundred years later. The appellation received full recognition by a High Court decision in 1937. In the 1930s, Count Henri de R\u00e9gis, the owner of the Ch\u00e2teau de S\u00e9gri\u00e8s in the heart of the village of Lirac improved the quality of his wines until in 1945 he obtained the highest distinction, a cru, of the C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne. Two years later in 1947 the appellation was confirmed by government decree. Lirac is the oldest wine in the C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne region and was the first to be produced in all three colours: red, ros\u00e9, and white.\nIn recent years, the planted vineyard area of Lirac has been increasing, and more high-quality wines are being produced."

Like the locality itself, the station was named after the French words 'joli mont', which translates to 'pretty mount' in English. The name was believed to have been given by the French-Swiss wife of Charles Joseph La Trobe, Victoria's first Governor.The original timber station building was manufactured in England in 1899. In the late 1920s, it was sold and re-erected in Canberra, on the site of the present Jolimont Centre. After being damaged by fire, it was demolished in 1977.In 1973, additional entrances and exits were provided. In 1985, the station was renamed Jolimont MCG, and at the time it was noted that it was unique in that no advertising was permitted on the station site, according to the construction finance contract.In November 2015, extra shelter and seats were provided on both platforms."

After four years of inactivity, the refinery was purchased by Petro-Canada for $10 million in 1980, but decided against reactivation, and instead sold the refinery to Bermuda-based refinery Newfoundland Processing Ltd. for $1 in 1986, which reopened it the following year.In August 1994, the Vitol Group purchased the refinery and the operating company North Atlantic Refining was founded. In 2014, it was acquired by SilverRange Capital Partners, a New York-based alternative asset manager. On May 28, 2020, Irving Oil announced that it was in negotiations to purchase the refinery. On October 5, 2020, the sale to Irving Oil collapsed and it was announced that the Come By Chance refinery would close permanently.In November 2021, the U.S. private equity group Cresta Fund Management purchased a controlling stake of the idling refinery and announced plans to convert the plant to a biofuel operation. As part of the acquisition, the refinery was renamed to Braya Renewable Fuels.On September 2, 2022, an explosion at the refinery injured 8 workers, one, Shawn Peddle of Clarenville (formerly of Hatchet Cove) died in hospital on October 15. The cause of the explosion is currently under investigation.In late August, 2023, the Government of Newfoundland & Labrador awarded exclusive rights to pursue development of the Toqlukuti'k Wind and Hydrogen Ltd.

Consolidated became famous, during the 1920s and 1930s, for its line of flying boats. The most successful of the Consolidated patrol boats was the PBY Catalina, which was produced throughout World War II and used extensively by the Allies. Equally famous was the B-24 Liberator, a heavy bomber which, like the Catalina, saw action in both the Pacific and European theaters.\nIn 1943, Consolidated merged with Vultee Aircraft to form Consolidated-Vultee Aircraft, later known as Convair.

In September 1924 the company moved from the Gallaudet plant in Connecticut to new facilities in Buffalo, New York, and in the same year won a U.S. Navy contract for a naval version of the PT-1 designated the NY-1.Lawrence D. Bell served as the Operating Head at Consolidated from 1929 to 1934. When the company relocated to San Diego, Bell decided to stay behind to start up his own company, the Bell Aircraft Corporation, in the former Consolidated plant.\nIn September 1935 Consolidated moved across the country to its new \"Building 1\", a 247,000-square-foot (22,900 m2) continuous flow factory in San Diego, California. The first production PBY Catalina was launched in San Diego Bay in 1936, and the first XPB2Y-1 Coronado test aircraft made its first flight in 1937. Consolidated vice president Edgar Gott was responsible for securing the company's contract to design and build the B-24 Liberator bomber. The XB-24 Liberator prototype made its first flight in December 1939, and the first production order was from the French in 1940, just days before their surrender to Germany; six of these YB-24 Liberators were designated LB-30A and ferried to Britain.In 1940, Consolidated bought Hall-Aluminum Aircraft Corporation and dissolved the company. Archibald M. Hall  was President of the company at the time and later became an executive of Consolidated. Several other Hall-Aluminum engineers and technical people were added to the Consolidated staff to meet defense production needs. By the fall of 1941, Consolidated was San Diego's largest employer with 25,000 employees, which eventually expanded to 45,000 by the following year.\nIn November 1941, Fleet sold his 34.26% interest in Consolidated for $10.9 million to Victor Emanuel, the president of AVCO, with the idea that Consolidated would be merged with AVCO's Vultee subsidiary.\nTo meet the needs of the military during World War II, General Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold decided to open a regular air transport service between the U.S. mainland and the Southwest Pacific in April 1942. The Ferry Command chose Consolidated as the operating agency, forming Consolidated Airways, Inc., also known as Consairways. The airlines carried personnel, cargo and delivered aircraft to the Pacific Theatre. It was reported to have carried more than 101 million tons of cargo and had flown more than 299 million passenger miles when it closed in 1945.In 1943, Consolidated merged with Vultee Aircraft to form Consolidated-Vultee Aircraft or Convair.\nIn March 1953, General Dynamics purchased a majority interest in Convair, where it continued to produce aircraft or aircraft components until being sold to McDonnell Douglas in 1994. McDonnell Douglas shut down the division after just two years of operations in 1996."

Reared in Shippensburg, Dr. Heck settled here in 1832, practiced medicine and served as a representative in the Pennsylvania General Assembly during the American Civil War. He also operated a large steam sawmill nearby from 1843 until 1890, and that specific area was known as Heckton Mills.By 1899 the small community was known as Heckton.U.S. Routes 22 and 322 pass through Heckton as a four-lane expressway, close to the Susquehanna River, with full access from PA 443 (Fishing Creek Valley Road). US 22/322 leads south, approximately 6.6 miles (11 km) to Harrisburg and northwest, about 1.3 miles (2 km) to the borough of Dauphin.\nYears ago, Heckton could be reached by travelling North Front Street/River Road (Old 22), about 6.2 miles (10 km) from Harrisburg to Heckton Road; however, Heckton Road was bisected when U.S. Routes 22 and 322 were expanded to a limited access expressway. As a result, the Heckton Cemetery (old Riverview Cemetery) and Cemetery Road, which parallels US 22/322 can be accessed from PA 443, just northeast of the US 22/322 interchange.\nThe historic Heckton Church was erected in 1885 for use by Methodists. In 2009, it was moved by Fort Hunter Mansion and Park to its current location at 5264 North Front Street. The church is available for weddings.\n\n\n== References =="

In March 2016, it dissolved to merge into the Solidarity Movement.The two predecessors were considered the most nationalist, anti-Turkish and anti-immigrant among Greek Cypriot parties. Evroko had a hard-line stance on the Cyprus problem, rejecting any compromise with Turkey or the Turkish-dominated Northern Cyprus, as proposed by the Annan Plan for Cyprus. It supported European integration and maintaining Greek influence in Cyprus. The party supported free market economic policies similar to that of Democratic Rally and the Democratic Party. In electoral campaigns, Evroko stirred up xenophobic ressentiments, suggesting that Greek Cypriots would become a minority in their own country, endangered by criminal, illegal aliens who would steal their jobs.The party was a member of the European Democratic Party.\nIn the elections of 21 May 2006, the party won 5.8 percent and 3 out of 56 seats. In the 2009 European parliament election, Evroko won 4.12% of votes. In the 2011 legislative elections the party won 3.88 percent and 2 out of 56 seats. In 2013, Nikos Koutsou, one of the two members of parliament, left the party to become an independent due to disagreement. For the European Parliament election, 2014, the party formed an alliance with the Democratic Rally (DISY). Both seats won by the alliance went to DISY members."

        "content": "Archaeological research revealed 9,000 years of human habitation at the Annasnappet Pond Site in Carver, from 10,000 to 1,000 years ago. The site contained 100,000 stone flakes, 1,600 stone tools and a human burial.\nCarver separated from Plympton, Massachusetts, and was incorporated in 1790 because many residents lived too far away to attend church in Plympton. The town was named for John Carver, the first Governor of the Plymouth Colony. Initially agricultural, Carver was known for the iron ore from its swamp lands used to make cooking tools by the 1730s. The first iron works was \"Pope's Point Furnace\", built in 1732, which operated for a century by using the bogs and Sampson's Pond. Over the next 150 years, sheep shearing and lumber mills were important in Carver.Most people at the time lived in the villages of South and North Carver and Wenham, later called East Carver. European settlers had also given the names \"Colchester\" and \"Lakenham\" to what is now North Carver, and settled in what was known as South Meadow. Each village supported at least one schoolhouse. As the market for iron ore declined in the latter part of the 19th century, Carver began cranberry farming as a new use for the town's swamp lands. Farmers began growing cranberries in the 1870s, and by 1900 it was Carver's farmers who raised a fifth of all cranberries grown in the United States. A railroad line connected Carver to New York and Boston in 1920, further establishing the town.Money from the iron helped the community to grow, as evidenced by several mansions still in existence in the town. Also located in Carver is Savery's Avenue, the first divided highway in America, which was opened to the public in 1860 by William Savery. The trees between the roads and on the outside of them were to be left for \"shade and ornament for man and beast\". Both road beds were macadamized in 1907. A portion of the expense was advanced by the daughters of the builder, Mrs. Mary P.S. Jowitt and Ms. H.D. Savery. By the 1940s the cranberry harvest was the largest in the world, and today it is still a major business in town. Because of the land taken for the bogs, however, growth is limited, giving the town a rural flavor it takes pride in. In 2012, most cranberry bogs are being replanted in favor of a new hybrid cranberry crop.\nCarver also has two notable tourist attractions. Edaville Railroad is a narrow-gauge railroad attraction which opened in 1949. It has long been a family tourist attraction in Southeastern Massachusetts, especially for its festival of lights around Christmastime. It has experienced a revival in recent years, after being sold in 1991 and nearly closing. The town is also the site of King Richard's Faire, a re-creation of a 16th-century English fair which is open on weekends throughout September and October. It is New England's largest Renaissance fair.Pro wrestler Mike Bennett is from Carver."

It is locally famous for the large number of cranberry bogs throughout the town. Carver is bordered by Plympton to the north, Kingston to the northeast, Plymouth to the east, Wareham to the south, and Middleborough to the west. Carver is located approximately 45 miles (72 km) south-southeast of Boston and 38 miles (61 km) east of Providence, Rhode Island.\nCarver's geography is shaped by its many small brooks, rivers and ponds including Vaughn Pond and Bates Pond. The majority of them eventually drain into Buzzards Bay, although some in the north of town lead to Cape Cod Bay or Narragansett Bay. The town also has an abundance of pine and cedar trees, and a portion of Myles Standish State Forest takes up much of the southeast corner of town. A large cedar swamp occupies the geographic center of the town. The town is also the site of a campground, a sportsmen's club, and a small town park at the center of town."

The Theatre struggled financially in its early years and nearly closed after being nominated for a Regional Theatre Tony Award in 1985. By 1986, the Theatre had approximately $600,000 in debt and announced plans to close, but community fundraising and a loan from the state government allowed the Theatre to pay off its debts.In 2009, the group built the 200-seat Touchstone Theatre to complement its outdoor amphitheater.In 2017, the complex finished a $7.7 million renovation project, replacing a wooden stage built in 1995 in the outdoor amphitheater and adding additional space for props and sets."

The barracks were used by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) until early 1991 when its soldiers withdrew from the site following breakup of Yugoslavia. In June of the same year, Slovenian soldiers entered barracks on the basis of an oral agreement between Presidents of Slovenia and Croatia, Milan Ku\u010dan and Franjo Tu\u0111man. Croatian President Tu\u0111man considered that it would be better for Croatia to avoid conflicts with a friendly Slovenian army in the west since the country was threatened by the hostile JNA from the east. Although the Slovenian army announced many times that its soldiers would leave the barracks, particularly in 1998 and 2000, it did not happen. In 2004, President Ku\u010dan stated in an interview for Ve\u010dernji list that it was time for the Slovenian soldiers to leave the barracks, adding that there was not a sufficient will of the Slovenian governing officials to do so. On 29 June 2017, the Arbitration Tribunal of the Permanent Court of Arbitration that was deciding on another border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia, mentioned in its verdict that Sveta Gera indeed belonged to Croatia but that it neither had jurisdiction to decide on the matter nor could it order Slovenian soldiers to withdraw."

After several years of inhabitancy, part of the people decided to move downwards to Togbloku and settled there.

There exist authorities of oral history (concerning this particular facts) in Ada who could be contacted for further verification. The current head of the Kudzrabe clan at Ada, Nene Tsatsu Pediator could be contacted, since he is a direct descendant of Torgbe Havi Etse.In the olden days the people of Ada spoke two languages, i.e., Ewe and Agdangbe.

It flows generally southeast, passing through the Saugatuck Reservoir (283 feet (86 m) above sea level), then turns south-southwest.  In Westport, it broadens into a navigable estuary along its lower 5 miles (8 km) and enters Long Island Sound approximately 4 miles (6 km) southeast of Norwalk. Interstate 95 crosses the river near its mouth downstream from Westport center. The river is wadeable along much of its course and is a popular seasonal destination for trout fishing, with the state of Connecticut stocking the river annually.In the 17th century the river was the site of a Paugusset settlement. The name of the river means \"river that flows out\" in the Paugusset language. The land east of the river was opened to white settlement in 1637 after the defeat of the Pequots by John Mason in the Pequot War. After treaties with the local tribes, members of the Connecticut Colony began to settle the area between the Saugatuck and the Norwalk rivers to the west between 1639 and 1661. In the 18th century farming villages sprang up along the river, which was the principal means of transportation. During the 19th century, the lower river became the site of warehouses and shipyards, as well as an important hub of maritime commerce. The town of Westport was incorporated out of the existing village of Saugatuck at the mouth of the Saugatuck River and several surrounding communities in 1835.\nIn 1908, the author Samuel Clemens moved into a villa he named \"Stormfield\" built on a hill overlooking the Saugatuck River in Redding, Connecticut. Clemens died in 1910, and the original Stormfield was destroyed in a 1923 fire.Bridgeport Hydraulic Company Holdings (now owned by Aquarion) flooded portions of the Saugatuck River Valley in Weston, Redding, and Easton after 1938, displacing the villages of Hull and Valley Forge to create the Saugatuck Reservoir."

The Vedic period is characterized by Indo-Aryan culture that invaded from Central Asia and settled in Punjab region. The Kambojas, Daradas, Kaikayas, Madras, Pauravas, Yaudheyas, Malavas and Kurus invaded, settled and ruled ancient Punjab region. After overrunning the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BCE, Alexander marched into present-day Punjab region with an army of approximately 50,000. Pakpattan was ruled by Maurya Empire, Indo-Greek kingdom, Kushan Empire, Gupta Empire, White Huns, Kushano-Hephthalites and the Turk and Hindu Shahi kingdoms.\nIn 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin. In 1005 A.D., he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region.\nThe main reason of the fame of this city is due to Sufi Baba Farid. Basically he is the man who renamed Ajodhan as Pakpattan. Before his arrival at Pakpattan, there were at least 30,000 Hindus and Sikhs in Pakpattan. He came to Pakpattan on the orders of his Murshad (teacher) Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki for preaching of Islam.\nAfter the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh conquered Pakpattan District. During the period of British rule, Pakpattan district increased in population and importance.\nThe predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Pakpattan District.\nOn 6 July 1910, First Rail Link was established to Pakpattan. 345.7 km (213.4 mi) long Lodhran - Kasur section was opened. This section was later dismantled during World War I, reconstructed and opened again between 1923 and 1924. On 15 April 2002, a new Karachi to Lahore express railway via Pakpattan was introduced.

The emperor's edict said: \"this canal-digging project is tough, but its role in [our] national security and national defense is not small, we should accept the hardship so that our descendants would have the benefit\".Alongside other canals constructed in the early nineteenth century, the V\u0129nh T\u1ebf Canal facilitated the advancement of the Vietnamese state into the Kampuchea Krom region of the Khmer world through both infrastructural and defense support."

Ram Rai was sent by his father as an emissary to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in Delhi. Aurangzeb objected to a verse in the Sikh scripture (Asa ki Var) that stated, \"the clay from a Musalman's grave is kneaded into potter's lump\", considering it an insult to Islam. Baba Ram Rai explained that the text was miscopied and modified it, substituting \"Musalman\" with \"Beiman\" (faithless, evil) which Aurangzeb approved. The willingness to change a word led Guru Har Rai to bar his son from his presence, and name his younger son as his successor. Aurangzeb responded by granting Baba Ram Rai a jagir (land grant) in Garhwal region (Uttarakhand). The town later came to be known as Dehradun, after Dehra referring to Baba Ram Rai's shrine. Many followers of Ram Rai, called Ramraiyas, settled with Ram Rai, During the days of British Raj, the official name of the town was Dehra. In due time the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun.\nIn the Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of Shiva. According to Hindu mythology, in ancient India during the Mahabharata epic era, Dronacharya, the great teacher of Kauravas and Pandavas, lived here, hence the name of \"Dronanagari\" (lit. city of Drona)."

        "content": "The history of the city of Uttarakhand, Dehradun (nicknamed \"Doon Valley\") is linked to the story of Ramayana and Mahabharata. It is believed that after the battle between Ravana and Rama, Rama and his brother Lakshmana visited this site. Also, known as 'Dronanagari' on the name of Dronacharya, legendary Royal guru to the Kauravas and Pandavas in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been born and resided in Dehradun. Evidence such as ancient temples and idols have been found in the areas surrounding Dehradun which have been linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had an influence on this region as the rulers of Hastinapura with the descendants of Subahu ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, Rishikesh is mentioned in the pages of history when Vishnu answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called Chakrata has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.\nIn the seventh century, this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller Huen Tsang. Sudhanagara later came to be recognised as Kalsi. Edicts of Ashoka have been found in the region along the banks of the river Yamuna in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region's prosperity. It was under control of Garhwal for many centuries ..fateh shah a garhwal king donated three villages in Dehradun to Sikh guru Ram rai.Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gurudwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard's map names the place as \"Dehra or Gurudwara\". Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city.\n\nDehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that Baba Ram Rai, the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his \"Dera\" (camp) in \"dun\" (valley) in 1676. This 'Dera Dun' later on became Dehradun.\nThe Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, Fateh Shah to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially, a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building, Guru Ram Rai Darbar Sahib, was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of Kangra-Guler art and Mughal art. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring 230 by 80 feet (70 m \u00d7 24 m) had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived.\n\nDehradun was invaded by Mahmud of Ghazni during his campaigns into India followed by Timur in 1368, Rohilla chief Najib ad-Dawlah in 1757 and Ghulam Qadir in 1785. ..in 1804 battles of khurbura at Dehradun fought between garhwal king Pradyuman shah and gorakha king amar Singh thapa.in which king Pradyuman shah died then this area came under control of gorakha. In 1806 the Nepalese warlord Kaji Amar Singh Thapa under the central leadership of Prime Minister Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa united many of the Indian territories that now fell under places such as Almora, Pathankot, Kumaon, Garhwal, Sirmur, Shimla, Kangra and Dehradun.\nOn the western front Garhwal and parts of Himachal Pradesh up to Punjab and on the eastern front the state of Sikkim up to Darjeeling became parts of Nepal for a brief period until the British East India Company went to war from 1814 to 1816. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Sugowli where almost a third was ceded to British East India company. The British got Dehradun in 1816 and colonised Landour and Mussoorie in 1827\u20131828.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, was quite fond of the city and often visited. He spent his last few days here before passing away in Delhi in 1964. Another leader from the independence movement, Rash Behari Bose, who was one of the key organisers of the Ghadar conspiracy and, later, the Indian National Army was based in Dehradun in his early days before he was forced to move to Japan in 1915 to continue the freedom struggle.\nPost-independence Dehradun and other parts of Garhwal and Kumaon were merged with United Provinces which was later renamed the state of Uttar Pradesh. In 2000, Uttarakhand state (earlier called Uttaranchal) was created from the northwestern districts of Uttar Pradesh under the Uttar Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2000. Dehradun was made its interim capital."

There are auto rickshaw which are often used for transportation but blamed for pollution and noise. The evening buzz of Rajpur road is an attraction. The city center is easily recognised by the Clock tower (Ghanta Ghar), a structure with four functioning clocks. The statue of San Dijen placed in Shanti Niketan contributes to the beauty of the city. Dehradun has been home to artists and writers including Stephen Alter, Nayantara Sahgal, Allan Sealy, Ruskin Bond and also to country singer Bobby Cash.\nDehradun was home to freedom fighters whose names are engraved in gold on the Clock Tower. It was called \"The Gray City\" in the initial days because ex-Army officers and VIPs considered this place ideal for residence after retirement.There are fairs (melas) throughout the year. Notable fairs include Magh Mela, held on 14 January and Jhanda Mela in March, a fair for the Sikh community, that attracts Sikhs from all over India and abroad."

The heath is the most important recreation area in the city and is also actively forested. Approximately 6,133 hectares of the Dresden Heath are designated as a nature preserve, making it one of the largest municipal forests in Germany by area. Though mainly agricultural areas border the forest in the east, in all other directions the Dresden Heath is bordered by districts of the city and reaches nearly to the city centre in the southwest.\nThe forest exhibits a transition, both in its geology and in its plant and animal life, between the North German Plain and the Central Uplands. Except for small areas, the Dresden Heath is considered part of the western Lusatian Highlands and, consequently, is one of the westernmost parts of the Sudetes. Though the rocky subsoil of the forest was raised during the tectonic formation of the Dresden Basin, the mixed woodland of the heath is largely characterized by dune-like sand deposits of the Wolstonian Stage and Elster glaciation. The proximity of the Dresden Heath to the centre of Dresden led to its use as a princely hunting ground, as well as its cultivation and cultural development."

The forest is mainly outside the urban area of Dresden and is largely in the administrative region of Loschwitz. In contrast to the other parts of this administrative area, the 4,836 hectare region is not considered an urban district, but forms a fully-fledged district of the same status. Smaller regions on the edge of the heath belong to the administrative districts of Neustadt and Klotzsche, as well as to the town of Radeburg. In the south, the main part of the heath stretches between Loschwitz and the Waldschl\u00f6sschen district, to the slopes of the Elbe and to Radeberger Vorstadt. The southernmost offshoots even border on the heavily populated \u00c4ussere Neustadt. In the west, the forest meets Albertstadt and Klotzsche. In the north, it is bordered by the Weixdorf districts of Lausa and Friedersdorf as well as by Langebr\u00fcck and Liegau-Augustusbad. In the east the forest is bordered by the town of Radeberg and its districts of Gro\u00dferkmannsdorf and Ullersdorf.\nThe Junge Heide (\"Young Heath\"), the smaller part, is to the west of the main part of the heath in the northwest of Dresden. It is bordered in the north by the districts of Wilschdorf and Hellerau, in the east by the Heller and in the south by Trachenberge and Trachau. In the west the Junge Heide meets the Radebeuler districts of Oberl\u00f6\u00dfnitz and Alt-Radebeul, in the northwest, Boxdorf. The part of the Junge Heide in the districts of Hellerberge and Wilschdorf belongs to the administrative district of Klotzsche. The western part of the Junge Heide, on the other hand, is assigned to Trachau. Together with a small area on the edge of the heath in the south that belongs to Trachenberge, it is in the administrative district of Pieschen. Further areas in the west of the Junge Heide are administered from Moritzburg or Radebeul.\nSurrounding landscapes include L\u00f6\u00dfnitz in the West, the Friedewald and the Moritzburg pond region in the northwest. In the north, the K\u00f6nigsbr\u00fcck-Ruhland Heaths and the Seifersdorf valley border the forest in the northeast. The landscape to the southeast is the Sch\u00f6nfeld Upland. On the southern border of the Heide, the forest segues into the park and garden landscape of the Dresden Elbe valley."

        "content": "Originally, the Dresden Heath was part of the expansive, continuous border forest between the Sorbian regions of Nisan and Milska. It was out of this forest that the Mark of Mei\u00dfen and Upper Lusatia developed. Originally, the Dresden Heath began in the city centre of Dresden and stretched seamlessly to the L\u00f6\u00dfnitz as well as to Kaditz, in the form of the Kaditz Forest. Archaeological discoveries, such as the Bronze Age burial grounds and late Stone Age Corded Ware pottery give evidence of early settlements in this area. The settlement of the region reduced the area of the forest with time. As part of the German eastward settlement in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, efforts to clear the forest reduced it to something close to its current size, though the Dresden Heath still stretched into the centre of Dresden, and the Junge Heide was not yet a separate forest.\nAfter 1372, the Dresden Heath was sovereign property assigned to the office of Radeberg, servicing the court of Saxony as a vast hunting territory from the Middle Ages to the First World War. The court in Dresden could 'hunt' its way from Dresden to the hunting retreat, Moritzburg Castle. Evidence of the heath's hunting history are the four so-called Saug\u00e4rten ('Swine gardens,' used in the hunt to hold captured wild boar, until it could be released to be hunted). Farmers have also used parts of the heath, such as the two meadows, for agriculture. In the light, sandy soil, agriculture did not last long and fields were often actively reforested or reclaimed by the forest itself. From 1484, the heath was administered by the Dresden Forest Office. The forest was heavily damaged in the Thirty Years' War as enemy troops burned parts of the forest and plundered surrounding villages. The Seven Years' War also brought great losses of wood to the Prussian occupiers. In 1831 the heath became a possession of the Saxon State but remained hunting grounds of the sovereign.\nIn the beginning of the nineteenth century the heath had an area of over 70 square kilometres, roughly fifty percent more than now. It still reached in the city centre across the Bischofsweg. The F\u00f6rstereistra\u00dfe ('Forestry Street') in Neustadt is named after a forester's lodge that existed there near the forest. Then the heath was reduced by 10 square kilometres for military reasons. Large areas were deforested after 1827 to create a training ground for the Saxon army, resulting in the existence of the Heller. After 1873 barracks were constructed in the new military district in Albertstadt, significantly reducing the southwestern area of the heath. Adjacent areas of the forest were also inaccessible because they were behind firing ranges. In the late nineteenth century, the former suburbs of Dresden began to grow. The Radeberger Vorstadt (city suburb in the direction of Radeberg) stretched further and further into the forest. Within a few years, people pushed the heath back out of the city centre by two kilometres. Klotzsche also grew into a city, in part at the expense of the forest. In Radebeul-Ost, Bad Wei\u00dfer Hirsch, Klotzsche-K\u00f6nigswald and the Radeberger Vorstadt more of the heath was converted into 'forest parks.' At the beginning of the twentieth century, the responsible authorities required compensatory plantings to counter smaller clearings of the heath. This resulted in the planting of a small forest near Biegau in 1910.\nThe Dresden Heath and Junge Heide became separated due to the development of transport corridors such as Radeburger and K\u00f6nigsbr\u00fccker Streets as well as the Saxon-Silesian railway and, finally, the present A4 motorway. In the Third Reich, planned highway construction affected the northeast part of the forest. The plan was for a continuation of the present Autobahn 13, resulting in a Berlin-Dresden-Prague connection. Some of the deforestation between Radeberg and Heidem\u00fchle was completed, but construction did not begin in the Second World War. The plans were later discarded and, in 2000, the same connection was built but with a completely different route and without affecting the heath in any way. In the 1930s there were plans for a continuation of the now-decommissioned rail line between D\u00fcrr\u00f6hrsdorf and Wei\u00dfig, along the Prie\u00dfnitz valley across the heath. This, too, remained in the planning stage and, since then, the forest has not been reduced by large construction projects.\nSince its incorporation into the city on the fourth of March, 1949, the Dresden Heath belongs to Dresden. Declared a special forest and recreation area in 1967, it has been a protected landscape since 1969. Due to forestry however, almost no area of the heath can be considered old growth forest. There are still inaccessible parts of the heath, a result of the former military use or of the construction of transportation buildings."

        "content": "Like other parts of the world, climate in Idaho has changed dramatically over the geologic history of the Earth.  Paleo-climatic records give some indication of these changes.  The longest instrumented records of climate in Idaho extend back to the late 1800s.  Concern over human induced climate change through the emission of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and methane from agriculture and industry, are driving research efforts across the state at university, state, and federals levels to understand what the implications of climate change could be in Idaho.\nIn the big picture of greenhouse gas emissions, Idaho emits the least carbon dioxide per person of the United States, less than 23,000 pounds a year. It relies mostly on nonpolluting hydroelectric power from its rivers.Like other parts of the world, Idaho has seen significant temperature increases, especially in the last several decades.  From 1971 to 2005 the average annual observed temperature in the Snake River Plain, located in southern Idaho, has increased by 1.4 degrees Celsius based on data from 10 climate stations (Dubois, Ashton, Oakely, Pocatello, Aberdeen, Hazelton, Jerome, Boise, Nampa, and Payette).  Statistically the increasing temperature trends are most significant in the months of January, March, and April.  While precipitation has generally increased since the early 1900s, the high variability in precipitation makes the identification of precipitation trends statistically difficult.\nOver the course of the 21st century, climate in Idaho is expected to experience additional changes due both to 'natural' climate variability and due to feedbacks related to the interaction between climate variability and increasing greenhouse gases. For example, based on projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and results from the United Kingdom Hadley Centre\u2019s climate model (HadCM2), a model that accounts for both greenhouse gases and aerosols, by 2100 temperatures in Idaho could increase by 5 \u00b0F (2.8 \u00b0C) (with a range of 2 \u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C) to 9 \u00b0F (5.0 \u00b0C)) in winter and summer and 4 \u00b0F (2.2 \u00b0C) (with a range of 2 \u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C) to 7 \u00b0F (3.9 \u00b0C)) in spring and fall. Precipitation is estimated to change little in summer, to increase by 10% in spring and fall (with a range of 5-20%), and to increase by 20% in winter (with a range of 10-40%). Other climate models may show different results, especially regarding estimated changes in precipitation. The impacts described in the sections that follow take into account estimates from different models. The amount of precipitation on extreme wet or snowy days in winter is likely to increase. The frequency of extreme hot days in summer would increase because of the general warming trend. It is not clear how the severity of storms might be affected, although an increase in the frequency and intensity of winter storms is possible."

        "content": "Dawson and its area were part of the Maxwell Land Grant. In the late 1860s, Lucien B. Maxwell sold more than 24,000 acres (97 km2) of land to John Barkley Dawson for $3,700. Dawson and his brother L.S. Dawson settled on the Vermijo River in 1867. The Maxwell Land Grant Company later attempted to evict Dawson, but his ownership of the land was confirmed by a court in 1901. \nCoal was discovered on the land in 1895, and in 1901, Dawson sold the land to C.B. Eddy for $400,000. Eddy and associates created the Dawson Fuel Company and constructed the Dawson Railroad from Tucumcari to the site of the mines. In 1905, Eddy sold the mines and railroad to the Phelps Dodge Company. Phelps Dodge main interest was in the coking quality of the coal, which made it suitable for steelmaking, which was one of the company's business interests at the time.\nThe corporation needed to attract workers to the remote location, so they built homes for the miners, along with numerous other facilities, including a hospital, department store, swimming pool, movie theater, and a golf course. With these amenities, Phelps Dodge was able to maintain a stable employment rate despite the inherent dangers of mining and the isolation of northern New Mexico. Many of the miners were recent immigrants. Dawson grew to have a population of 6,000 in 1913. \nIn total, the Dawson coal operations had ten mines, numbered 1\u201310, in the immediate vicinity of Dawson. The mines are generally referred to as \"Stag Canyon #\", a reference to the operating company, but they are also often referred to as \"Dawson Mine #\", in reference to their locale.  Different web pages which use GNIS data have Dawson Mine No. 5 as being located eight miles (12.9 km) north of the other mines.  In looking at other source documents found in Google Books, this appears to be an error. The actual Dawson Mine No. 5 was located along the Vermejo River, near the town of Lauretta.\nSeveral of these mines were connected to the coal processing and loading facilities in Dawson by means of an electric-powered narrow gauge (36 inch (914.4 mm) gauge) railroad. This railroad was apparently 6,600 feet (2,011.7 meters) in length, running along Rail Canyon from the entries of Mines 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. Mines 5 and 7 also connected to this line through underground connections to the other mines, but they also had their own tipples. Cars would be loaded inside the mines, taken outside, and then transported in trains of cars to the facilities in Dawson proper. This line served the No. 1 & 2 Tipples, located in Rail Canyon.\nMines 8, 9,and 10 are located to the SW of the town of Dawson, and early research indicates that they had their own mine tipple for coal cleaning and loading into standard gauge railroad cars for delivery to customers. These three mines also had an electric-powered railroad inside them, which led to their own tipple, but they apparently were not connected to the other mines.\nThe coal was cleaned of non-combustible debris and sorted into general sizes for different uses. In addition to the coal processing facilities, there were also coking ovens which processed the coal, transforming it into coke, which was used for metal processing by Phelps Dodge at other facilities. The coking ovens produced carbon monoxide gas, which was captured and then burned to create steam for generating electricity for mine machinery and electric lighting, both in the mines and in the towns around the mines.\nThe Dawson Railway was purchased by Phelps Dodge at the same time and made part of its El Paso and Southwestern Railroad system. The EP&SW was later purchased by the Southern Pacific Railroad, which also purchased long term contracts for coal production from Dawson. The SP used steam locomotives, which were mostly fueled by oil, but the operating division located at Tucumcari utilized coal fueled steam engines, the only group of such locomotives on their roster.\nIn 1912, Dawson was home to minor league baseball. The Dawson Stags became members of the four-team Class D level Rocky Mountain League during the season. The league started the season with the Ca\u00f1on City Swastikas, Colorado Springs Millionaires, La Junta Railroaders and Pueblo Indians beginning Rocky Mountain League play. During the season, the Colorado Springs franchise relocated to Dawson on June 15, 1912. The Rocky Mountain League permanently folded after the 1912 season."

The tall smoke stacks of the coking ovens were eventually demolished in the early 2000s because they represented a liability to the current owner of the property.\nThe only significant landmark remaining in Dawson is the Dawson Cemetery, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. The cemetery is filled with iron crosses painted white, marking the graves of many miners who died in the mines.  Other markers show the burial locations of other residents of Dawson.\nDawson can be reached by taking Route 64 approximately 12 miles (19.3 km) east of Cimarron and then heading north onto A38 at the striped sign and proceeding on that road for another 5 miles (8.1 km). After A38 crosses the adjacent railroad tracks a second time, turn onto the dirt road on the right (which proceeds east of A38 for approximately 1,000 feet (304.8 meters)) to reach the site of the Dawson cemetery. The ruins of Dawson can be seen by continuing north on A38, which turns into Barus Road and then splits into Lauretta Road and Rail Canyon Road."

In addition to the existing mission of securing both sea flanks in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, the navy was tasked with responding to emergencies far away from the Indian mainland. Marine assault capabilities were to be enhanced by setting up a new amphibious warfare facility at Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh.Since then, the Indian Navy has initiated Phase II expansion of INS Kadamba, its third largest naval base, near Karwar. Phase II will involve expansion of the berthing facilities to accommodate 40\u201345 more front-line warships, including the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, raise manpower to 300 officers and around 2,500 sailors, and build a naval air station with a 6,000-foot runway. This is to be followed by Phase IIA and IIB, at the end of which INS Kadamba will be able to base 50 front-line warships. The Indian Navy is also in the process of constructing a new naval base, INS Varsha, at Rambilli for its Arihant class submarines.India's planned second aircraft carrier, INS Vishal (formerly known as Indigenous Aircraft Carrier-II), will displace around 65,000 tonnes and is expected to be delivered to the Indian Navy in the mid-2030s. With the future delivery of Vishal, the Navy's goal to have three aircraft carriers in service, with two fully operational carriers and a third in refit, will be achieved.\nIn November 2011, the Defence Acquisition Council launched the Multi-Role Support Vessel. The Indian Navy has subsequently sent out an international RFP for up to 2 large landing helicopter docks. The contenders are expected to tie up with local shipyards for construction of the ships.In addition to aircraft carriers and large amphibious assault ships, the Indian Navy is acquiring numerous surface combatants such as the Visakhapatnam-class destroyers, Project 17A-class and Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates, ASW shallow water corvettes, ASuW corvettes, and MCM vessels. It plans to build Project 18 class destroyers. New submarine classes under various stages of planning and construction include the Project 75 Alpha,  the conventional Kalvari class, Project 75I, and the nuclear-powered Arihant class.

In 2001, this flag was replaced with a white ensign bearing the Indian Navy crest, as the previous ensign was thought to reflect India's colonial past. However complaints arose that the new ensign was indistinguishable as the blue of the naval crest easily merged with the sky and the ocean. Hence in 2004, the ensign was changed back to the St. George's cross design, with the addition of the emblem of India in the intersection of the cross. In 2014, the ensign as well as the naval crest was further modified to include the Devanagari script: \u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f\u092e\u0947\u0935 \u091c\u092f\u0924\u0947 (Satyameva Jayate) which means 'Truth Alone Triumphs' in Sanskrit.The traditional crest of Indian Navy ships is topped by a crown featuring three sailing ships symbolising India's rich maritime history. The ribbon of the crown depicts the Ashoka Chakra surrounded by a horse and a bull. Each ship has a unique motif which is encircled by a ring of lotus buds.In August 2022, the Prime Minister's Office announced that the naval ensign featuring the Saint George's Cross would be irrevocably disposed of, in favour of a newer design derived from octagonal shaped imperial seal of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his Maratha Navy that would \"do away with the colonial past\" and reflect the \"rich Indian maritime heritage\". The new ensign is slated to be revealed by prime minister Narendra Modi on 2 September 2022, coinciding with the commissioning ceremony of INS Vikrant, the Indian Navy's first indigenously built aircraft carrier. The new ensign retains much the design of the 2001-04 ensign with the national flag as the canton, but with the addition of an octagonal navy blue shield based on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's royal seal surrounding the heraldic arms in gold and the addition of the official motto of the Navy May the Lord of Waters Be Auspicious Unto Us (Sha\u1e41 No Varuna\u1e25) in the Devanagari script."

        "content": "The earliest recording of Debar is under the name of \u2018Deborus\u2019 on a map drawn by the astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy in the 2nd century.The Byzantine emperor Basil II knew of its existence, historian Anna Komnena recorded the name as Devr\u00e9 in the Alexiad, and Feliks Petan\u010di\u0107 referred to it as Dibri in 1502.After Samuel of Bulgaria was defeated in 1014 by Byzantine emperor Basil II, Debar was administered under the Bishopric of Bitola.\nDuring the period from the 12th, to early 14th century, Debar was ruled by the Albanian noble Gropa family. In the latter half of the 14th century until the first half of the 15th century it was ruled by the Principality of Kastrioti, an Albanian medieval principality ruled by the Kastrioti noble family and later from 1443 by the Albanian state, League of Lezh\u00eb. Debar fell under the rule of the Ottoman Empire when local ruler Gjon Kastrioti died shortly after his four children were taken hostage.It was conquered by the Ottomans in 1395 and subsequently became the seat of the Sanjak of Dibra.\nIn 1440 Skanderbeg was appointed as its sanjakbey.Gjergj Kastrioti, survived to take back his father's land and unite all of Albania in 1444. A larger than life size statue of Skanderbeg adorns Dib\u00ebr's centre, showing the fondness that the locals have for his cause. During the Ottoman-Albanian wars between 1443-1479 the Dib\u00ebr region was the borderline between the Ottomans and the League of Lezh\u00eb led by Skanderbeg and became an area of continuous conflict. There were two major battles near Debar, on 29 June 1444 The Battle of Torvioll and on 27 September 1446 The Battle of Otonet\u00eb both ending with the defeat of the Ottoman armies and Albanian victories.\nDebar was overrun once again by the Turks, and became known as Debre. The city constantly rebelled against Turkish rule, however, not least because of the wealth of the many Turkish bey and aga who lived there off local taxes and the fat of the land. Turkish rule also brought trade to Debar and the city centre grew and became known for its crafts industry. Much of the architect from that period still survives. An Ottoman army division was also stationed within the town.It was first a sanjak centre in Scutari Vilayet before 1877, and afterwards in Manastir Vilayet between 1877-1912 as Debre or Debre-i Bala (\"Upper Debre\" in Ottoman Turkish, as contrasted with Debre-i Zir, which was Peshkopi's Turkish name).\nDebar was significantly involved in the national Albanian movement and on 1 November 1878 the Albanian leaders of the city participated in founding the League of Prizren.\nIn 1907 the Congress of Dibra was held in the town, which made Albanian an official language within the Ottoman Empire. The congress allowed that Albanian be taught in schools legally for the first time within the Empire.\nFollowing the capture of the town of Debar by Serbia, many of its Albanian inhabitants fled to Turkey, the rest went to Tirana. Of those that ended up in Istanbul, some of their number migrated to Albania, mainly to Tirana where the Dibran community formed an important segment of the capital city's population from 1920 onward and for some years thereafter.During the Balkan wars of 1912\u201313 Debar was taken back by the Albanians, but was then handed over to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as a reward for helping the Allies during World War I. Thereafter many Serbs and Montenegrins were encouraged to settle in Debar, a common tactic to ensure that newly acquired land became more integrated with the motherland.It was occupied by Kingdom of Bulgaria between 1915 and 1918.\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Debar was part of the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\nDebar was annexed, along with most of Western North Macedonia, into the Italian-controlled Kingdom of Albania on 17 April 1941, following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia during the Second World War. Albania was officially a protectorate of Italy and therefore public administration duties were passed to Albanian authorities. Albanian language schools, radio stations and newspapers were established in Debar. When Italy capitulated in September 1943, Debar passed into German hands. In 1944, after a two-month struggle for the city between the communist Albanian National Liberation Front and German forces holding the city, including the SS Skanderbeg division, the communists led by Haxhi Lleshi finally secured Debar on 30 August 1944.After the cessation of hostilities with the end of WW2 and the establishment of communism in both Albania and Yugoslavia, Debar passed back into Yugoslav hands."

In fact, Debar was one of the then famous three woodcarving schools in the region, the other two being Samokov and Bansko. Their work can be seen in many churches and cultural buildings throughout the Balkan Peninsula. The Mijak School of woodcarving became noted for its artistic excellence, and an amazing example that can be seen today by tourists is the iconostasis in the nearby Monastery of Saint Jovan Bigorski, near the town of Debar. The monastery was rebuilt in the 19th century and is situated on the slopes of Mount Bistra, above the banks of the River Radika. The monastery was built on the remains of an older church dating from 1021.\nAnother important religious monument is the monastery of Saint Gjorgi in the village of Rajcica in the immediate vicinity of Debar. The monastery was recently built.\nGrigor Parlichev was given the title Second Homer in 1860 in Athens for his poem The Serdar. Based on a folk poem, it deals with the exploits and heroic death of Kuzman Kapidan, a famous hero and protector of Christian people in the Debar region in their struggle with bandits.\nSome of the oldest and richest Albanian epics still exist in the Debar regions and are part of the Albanian mythological heritage.\nDebar is also known for its pizza consumption. As of 2018, Debar had one pizzeria for every 3,000 residents, and emigrants from the town had opened approximately 50 pizza restaurants in the United States."

Succeeding, El Salvador played at the Estadio Nacional de la Flor Blanca, now known as Estadio Jorge \"M\u00e1gico\" Gonz\u00e1lez, also in San Salvador. It was opened on 19 April 1932 during the presidency of Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez in preparation for the 1935 Central American and Caribbean Games. On 24 March 1935 El Salvador played its first game at the Flor Blanca against Cuba and won 4\u20131. El Salvador played at this stadium during qualification for the 1970 World Cup. On 15 November 2000, a one-off game was played at the stadium, to commemorate a major refurbishment, against Jamaica in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers.In 1969, EDESSA (Estadios Deportivos de El Salvador Sociedad An\u00f3nima) proposed the idea of a new national stadium. This resulted in construction of the Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n, with the president of El Salvador, General Fidel S\u00e1nchez Hern\u00e1ndez, breaking ground on 24 March 1971. The stadium held its first game on 24 July 1976, a friendly between El Salvador and the German Bundesliga champions, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. It ended in a 2\u20130 victory to the German side. The Borussia squad featured players from their 1974 World Cup winning squad, including Berti Vogts, Rainer Bonhof, Wolfgang Kleff and Jupp Heynckes, alongside Allan Simonsen, who later won the 1977 Ballon d'Or and joined Barcelona. El Salvador's team was Tom\u00e1s Pineda (Mauricio \"Tarz\u00e1n\" Alvarenga), Guillermo \"Billy\" Rodr\u00edguez Bou, Ram\u00f3n Fagoaga, Humberto \"Imacasa\" Recinos, Eduardo \"Conejo\" Vald\u00e9s, V\u00edctor \"Pato\" Valencia, Warner Sol\u00eds, F\u00e9lix \"Garrobita\" Pineda (C\u00e9sar \"Piscucha\" Acevedo), Luis \"Pel\u00e9\" Ram\u00edrez Zapata (Abraham Coreas) & Ismael \"Cisco\" D\u00edaz (David Cabrera). Borussia also fielded Wolfgang Kneib, Hans-J\u00fcrgen Wittkamp, Horst Wohlers, Dietmar Danner, Hans Klinkhammer, Carsten Nielsen and Uli Stielike. Since that match, El Salvador has used the stadium for almost every major home game, and it is also the home ground of Alianza.  On 25 May 1978, EDESSA agreed to sign a 99-year lease of the stadium to CLIMA (Asociaci\u00f3n de Clubes de Liga Mayor A) to operate and control which events are held there."

Hughes had taken over as leader of the Australian Labor Party and Prime Minister of Australia when anti-conscriptionist Andrew Fisher resigned in 1915. He formed the new party for himself and his followers after he was expelled from the ALP a month after the 1916 plebiscite on conscription in Australia. Hughes held a pro-conscription stance in relation to World War I."

Believing the Labor Party was no longer sufficiently nationalist, they began laying the groundwork for a new party that would be both socially radical and nationalist.\nIn 1917, Hughes and Cook turned their confidence-and-supply agreement into a formal party, the Nationalist Party of Australia.  Hughes became the merged party's leader, with Cook as his deputy.  Although it was essentially an upper- and middle-class party dominated by former Liberals, the presence of several Labor men allowed the party to project an image of national unity.\nThe National Labor Party was never formally constituted itself as a party and had no organisational structure, although some trade union officials and Labor Party branches, particularly in Western Australia and Tasmania, supported it."

The two merged in April\u2013May 1917, with former Premier John Scaddan as their leader. However, by July he was without a seat in Parliament, and the party turned to Federal Senators Patrick Lynch, Hugh de Largie and George Pearce for leadership and guidance. Unlike its federal counterpart, it maintained its own distinct identity and structure and worked with the Nationalists as coalition partners. A number of Western Australian unions disaffiliated from the Australian Labor Federation to support the National Labor movement\u2014most notably those representing the engine-drivers, railway employees, boilermakers and carpenters which were powerful in the goldfields. Organisationally, however, the party was believed to be over-dependent on its Senate patrons and struggled to build a genuine extraparliamentary organisation.\nThe party scored six of 50 Assembly seats in each of the 1917 and 1921 elections, and held three of 30 Council seats during this period. However, in the 1924 elections, their representation was reduced to one in the Assembly and two in the Council\u2014many through the defeat of sitting NLP members by Labor candidates\u2014and later that year, what remained of the Party was subsumed by the Nationalists."

The Monastery on the Remigiusberg arose as a holding of first the Bishopric of Reims and then later the Abbey of Saint-Remi only in the earlier half of the 12th century, and all the time it had great difficulties asserting itself over the secular lordship. In the time of the Reformation, following the principle of cuius regio, eius religio, the Haschbach villagers, along with all subjects of the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr\u00fccken, adopted the Lutheran faith. In 1550, the Abbey of Saint-Remi under Abbot Robert de Lenoncourt sold the Remigiusland to the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr\u00fccken for a price of 8,500 Rhenish guilders, thus secularizing the Abbey. The Abbey's last provost, Johannes Peuchet, had died decades earlier, in 1520, but he had had a son out of wedlock who bore the same name, and who served in both Baumholder and Kusel as a Lutheran pastor. The church on the mountain, which had already been favoured as a burying place back in the time of the earlier Counts of Veldenz, was preserved and now members of this new County of Palatinate-Veldenz were buried here, too. During the Thirty Years' War, Benedictine monks temporarily moved into the monastery. Shortly thereafter, the buildings began to fall into disrepair. After the Thirty Years' War and during French King Louis XIV's wars of conquest, but mainly after 1713 after the County of Palatinate-Veldenz had passed to Electoral Palatinate, the Catholic faith once again began to spread in Haschbach and elsewhere. The church on the Remigiusberg was assigned to the Catholics in 1724, and in 1744, the autonomous parish of St. Remigius Remigiusberg came into being. The church's maintenance was very costly, which was why even before the French Revolution a few zinc coffins from the Electoral crypt at the provostry church were sold so that the needed renovation work could be done. When the French Revolution came, though, the comital burial place was utterly destroyed. In very recent times, those seeking to sort and identify the heaped-up comital bones have enjoyed some success. Under the Kings of Bavaria, the church was renovated and assigned as the Theisbergstegen Catholic congregation's community church. Catholic and Evangelical villagers nowadays belong to the corresponding church communities in Theisbergstegen and the corresponding deaconries of Kusel."

Its location stems from the Royal Colonial Boundary of 1665, which was meant to delimit overlapping inland claims of the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Carolina, respectively.\nIn 1812, this area of the river was highly disrupted and was reported to even flow backward because of the 1811\u20131812 New Madrid series of earthquakes, some of the most powerful ever felt in the United States.The state of Tennessee contested the inclusion of the Kentucky Bend in the state of Kentucky, claiming it as part of Obion County until at least 1848, but Tennessee eventually dropped its claim.This area of the Mississippi River, from just east at \"Island Number Ten\" around to the town of New Madrid, Missouri, was the site of a Civil War battle from February 28 to April 8, 1862, the Battle of Island Number Ten.\nDue to its highly productive soil in the river's floodplain, Kentucky Bend was developed as a major cotton-producing area. The 1870 census recorded more than 300 residents. In The West Tennessee Farm edited by Marvin Downing (University of Tennessee at Martin Press, 1979), Norman L. Parks reports  a population in 1880 of 303, of whom 18 were African American. By 1900,  \"large numbers of Negroes in the Bend\" were working as laborers to plant and harvest the cotton.\nIn Mark Twain's book Life on the Mississippi, he described the six-decade-long feud between the Darnell and Watson families and other elements of life in the bend."

That of Umuadafe is celebrated annually in December (around the Christmas period) drawing the attention of numerous people from far and near to the town. The festival is aimed at cleansing and purifying the town as a whole and songs and to thank the Almighty God for abundant harvest which the farmers of the town may have experienced all through the year. During this festival, traditional songs are also composed to ridicule defaulters of the norms and traditions of the society no matter their social standing in the town. Ohene (Chief Priest) and Eze-Iwus are expected to perform some rituals of the cleansing of the town to properly take place.\nEvidence from Ibusa historians suggest that the Iwaji festival celebrated by the people of Ibusa may have been imported from the neighbouring Anioma town of Okpanam, in Delta State, and the Ichu-Ulor (Ulor festival) celebrated by Ezukwu, Umuodafe, Umuekea, Umuidinaisagba, Ogbeowele and Umueze Quarters of the town from Aballa and Ndokwa communities respectively. Ifejioku is another annual festival often traditionally celebrated by indigenes. Uchu-Ulor in Ibusa is annually celebrated in August.\nThe people have vast cultures and celebrations are unique but yet to be fully exploited by the state government. One such event is the popular Iwu Festival being celebrated by Ogbeowele and Umuodafe respectively. The Iwu festival is held annually at the end of the farming period to thank God who made it possible for them to see the farming year run out. Iwu is believed to have been brought to Ibusa by Oyana of Adigwe family in of Umuwor Ogbeowele quarter of the town. The Ogwa (shrine) where it was first celebrated can still be found by the entrance in Umuwor, Ogbeowele. The principal actors of the festival are three Eze Iwu and an Ohene. The event starts with four days of absolute silence when no noise is entertained, or it attracts a penalty which ranges from kola nuts to a fine of a goat which in those days happens to be the highest fine. During this period, okanga dance from other quarters is diverted to another route, there is also no marriage as it also serves as a period of Lent and purification of the land."

She would seem determined to make adoption of Ibusa to lend a helping hand because of the great potential that can be seen as far as development advancing goes and also help bring the Iwu Festival of the town to the attention of the world. Finally, she submitted that \"as technology advances and time progresses, it will be a matter of time until the village of Ibusa reaches a good level of its potential. One day it could be a major attraction of greater area of Asaba, maybe even a capital village\"\nIn an article in This Day entitled \"Ibusa: Millionaires paradise\", 25 October 2008, Igbuzo was adjudged thus:\n\"The quintessential millionaires' haven. This is reflected in the choice of mansions in the rustic community. Scattered around its rustic landscape are palatial mansions built by wealthy indigenes who earn their living from outside the town. In Ibusa, modern architectural masterpieces stand in sharp contrast with sun-baked mud homes adorned with rusty corrugated zinc roofs of less endowed relatives\".The combination of ancient and modern interpiece in the town has also drawn comparison to poignant images in Wole Soyinka's poem \"Ibadan\".\nOgbogu Okonji, Agility Okonji, Nwanze Nwabuwa (AKA Nwanze Nwagbodi) and Uche Nwalama are four of the greatest musicians of Ibusa extraction. However, Ogbogu Okonji by far remains the most prominent of them all."

Over time, the residents of Ibusa have decried the power outage, constantly lamenting its negative effects on their lifestyle.\nThe power outage was blamed on the fact that the town could not meet the revenue target of the power company (then NEPA) which led to them concentrating the power supply on the state capital and other major cities.\nAs at December 2015, a contract was awarded by the state government to Kainene Olisa services for the rehabilitation of the electricity network of the Ibusa town. After which, electricity was restored, only for them to be plunged back into darkness again after two months. This happened, not surprisingly, because the residents couldn't pay their electricity bills. According to sources, the consumers who were connected legally were grossly overbilled for the cost of numerous illegally connected consumers.

The Umuodafe team won the 2009 edition of the competition.\nThe Umuekea team would emerge winners with unbeaten runs, winning all their matches without conceding a single goal, thus setting a record which may stand for a very long time, considering the healthy rivalry the tournament usually holds for competitors. The 2007 edition of the tournament was won by the Bank PHB sponsored-Umueze team, which won the competition for the first time since the existence of the tournament. In the 2008 edition, the Umueze team failed to qualify beyond the group stage, losing to Umuekea and Umuodafe, two superior teams that would make it to the finals of the tournament.

The exact date is unknown, but it was likely built in 1837, around the time of his marriage. Marvin at the time was co-owner of the hotel along with his brother, and the house faced the rear of the hotel across the square, originally called Marvin Square after the family. The front bay windows were added shortly after it was built.During the house's construction, in 1833, Marvin heard of the proposed rail link that would connect the village with existing tracks at Ballston Spa. He sold a piece of land to the railroad so that the trains could run past the house and the hotel. The house thus became a landmark of Saratoga Springs to visitors.It remained with the Marvins and their descendants for a century. Two of them were active in politics. William A. Sackett, Marvin's son-in-law served as a congressman around 1850, and later spent his last years in the house. Hiram Charles Todd, a lawyer and friend of the Sackett family who had served as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York, inherited the house in 1927.

However, the town first officially appears in history as an outpost of the Roman Republic founded in 100 BC, probably built to guard one of the traditional invasion routes into northern Italy over the Alps. Its Latin name was Eporedia.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Ivrea became the seat of a duchy under the Lombards (6th-8th centuries). Under the Franks (9th century), Ivrea was a county capital. In the year 1001, after a period of disputes with bishop Warmund, ruler of the city, Arduin conquered the March of Ivrea. Later he became King of Italy and began a dynasty that lasted until the 11th century, when the city fell again under the bishops' sovereignty.\nIn the 12th century, Ivrea became a free comune, but succumbed in the first decades of the following century to the rule of Emperor Frederick II. Later, Ivrea was disputed between the bishops, the marquisate of Monferrato and the House of Savoy.\nIn 1356, Ivrea was acquired by Amadeus VI of Savoy. With the exception of the brief French conquest at the end of the 16th century, Ivrea remained under the House of Savoy until 1800. It was a subsidiary title of the king of Sardinia, although the only Marquis of Ivrea was Benedetto of Savoy (who later fought in the French Revolutionary wars). On May 26, 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte entered the city along with his victorious troops, establishing control that ended in 1814 after his fall.\nDuring the 20th century, its primary claim to fame was as the base of operations for Olivetti, a  manufacturer of typewriters, mechanical calculators and, later, computers. The Olivetti company no longer has an independent existence, though its name still appears as a registered trademark on office equipment manufactured by others. In 1970, about 90,000 people, including commuters from Southern Italy, lived and worked in the Ivrea area.The Arduino electronic platform was created at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, and takes its name from a bar named after the historical figure of Arduin of Italy. UNESCO, when it designated the city a World Heritage Site, said that it \"expresses a modern vision of the relationship between industrial production and architecture.\""

During the 2013\u201314 season, Bayern used an all-red home kit with a Bavarian flag diamond watermark pattern, a Lederhosen-inspired white and black Oktoberfest away kit, and an all-navy blue international kit.In the 1980s and 1990s, Bayern used a special away kit when playing at Kaiserslautern, representing the Brazilian colours blue and yellow, a superstition borne from the fact that the club found it hard to win there."

The colours of Bavaria were included for the first time in 1954. The crest from 1919 to 1924 denotes \"Bayern FA\", whereby \"FA\" stands for Fu\u00dfball-Abteilung, i.e., Football Department; Bayern then was integrated into TSV Jahn Munich and constituted its football department.The modern version of the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps. While the crest consisted of a single colour only for most of the time, namely blue or red, the current crest is blue, red, and white. It has the colours of Bavaria in its centre, and FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen is written in white on a red ring enclosing the Bavarian colours."

        "content": "Bayern played its first training games at the Schyrenplatz in the centre of Munich. The first official games were held on the Theresienwiese. In 1901, Bayern moved to a field of its own, located in Schwabing at the Clemensstra\u00dfe. After joining the M\u00fcnchner Sport-Club (MSC) in 1906, Bayern moved in May 1907 to MSC's ground at the Leopoldstra\u00dfe. As the crowds gathering for Bayern's home games increased at the beginning of the 1920s, Bayern had to switch to various other premises in Munich.From 1925, Bayern shared the Gr\u00fcnwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich. Until the Second World War, the stadium was owned by 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as Sechz'ger (\"Sixties\") Stadium. It was destroyed during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork. Bayern's record crowd at the Gr\u00fcnwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg in the 1961\u201362 season. In the Bundesliga era, the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000, which was reached on several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272. As was the case at most of this period's stadiums, the vast majority of the stadium was given over to terracing. Since 1995, the second teams and youth teams of both clubs played in the stadium.\nFor the 1972 Summer Olympics, the city of Munich built the Olympiastadion. The stadium, renowned for its architecture, was inaugurated in the last Bundesliga match of the 1971\u201372 season. The match drew a capacity crowd of 79,000, a total which was reached again on numerous occasions. In its early days, the stadium was considered one of the foremost stadiums in the world, and played host to numerous major finals, such as that of the 1974 FIFA World Cup. In the following years, the stadium underwent several modifications, such as an increase in seating space from approximately 50 per cent to 66 per cent. Eventually, the stadium had a capacity of 63,000 for national matches and 59,000 for international occasions such as European Cup competitions. Many people, however, began to feel that the stadium was too cold in winter, with half the audience exposed to the weather due to lack of cover. A further complaint was the distance between the spectators and the pitch, betraying the stadium's track and field heritage. Renovation proved impossible, as the architect G\u00fcnther Behnisch vetoed major modifications of the stadium.\nAfter much discussion, the city of Munich, the state of Bavaria, Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich jointly decided at the end of 2000 to build a new stadium. While Bayern had wanted a purpose-built football stadium for several years, the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany stimulated the discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the FIFA criteria to host a World Cup game. Located on the northern outskirts of Munich, the Allianz Arena has been in use since the beginning of the 2005\u201306 season. Since August 2012, 2,000 more seats were added in the last row of the top tier, increasing the capacity to 71,000. In January 2015, a proposal to increase the capacity was approved by the city council, with the Allianz Arena holding a capacity of 75,000 (70,000 in Champions League).The stadium's most prominent feature is the translucent outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colours for effects. Red lighting is used for Bayern home games and white for German national team home games.In May 2012, Bayern opened a museum about its history, FC Bayern Erlebniswelt, inside the Allianz Arena."

This made the club the largest fan membership club in the world. Bayern has an average of 75,000 fans at the Allianz Arena which is at 100 per cent capacity level. Every Bundesliga game has been sold-out for years. Bayern's away games have also been sold out for many years. According to a study by Sport+Markt from 2010, Bayern is the fifth-most popular football club in Europe with 20.7 million supporters, ranking first of all German clubs.The club's most prominent ultra groups are Schickeria M\u00fcnchen, Inferno Bavaria, Red Munichs '89, S\u00fcdkurve '73, Munichmaniacs 1996, Red Angels, and Red Sharks. The ultras scene of Bayern Munch has been recognised for certain groups taking stance against right-wing extremism, racism and homophobia, and in 2014 the group Schickeria M\u00fcnchen received the Julius Hirsch Award by the DFB for its commitment against antisemitism and discrimination.Stern des S\u00fcdens is the song which fans sing at FCB home games. In the 1990s, they also used to sing FC Bayern, Forever Number One. Another notable song is Mia San Mia (Bavarian for \"we are who we are\"), which is a well-known motto of the club as well. A renowned catchphrase for the team is \"Packmas\", which is a Bavarian phrase for the German \"Packen wir es\", which means \"let's do it\". The club's mascot is \"Berni\" since 2004.The club also has had a number of high-profile supporters, among them Pope Benedict XVI, Boris Becker, Wladimir Klitschko, Horst Seehofer and Edmund Stoiber, former Minister-President of Bavaria."

        "content": "Bayern is one of three professional football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who was the more successful club in the 1950s and was controversially picked for the initial Bundesliga season in 1963, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting much extra attention from supporters of both clubs. Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.Since the 1920s, 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg has been Bayern's main and traditional rival in Bavaria. Philipp Lahm said that playing N\u00fcrnberg is \"always special\" and is a \"heated atmosphere\". Both clubs played in the same league in the mid-1920s, but in the 1920s and 1930s, N\u00fcrnberg was far more successful, winning five championships in the 1920s, making the club Germany's record champion. Bayern took over the title more than sixty years later, when they won their tenth championship in 1987, thereby surpassing the number of championships won by N\u00fcrnberg. The duel between Bayern and N\u00fcrnberg is often referred to as the Bavarian Derby.\nBayern also has a strong rivalry with the Kaiserslautern, originating in parts from a game in 1973, when Bayern lost 7\u20134 after leading 4\u20131, but also from the two clubs competing for German championship honours at various times in the Bundesliga, as well as the city of Kaiserslautern, together with the surrounding Palatinate, having been part of Bavaria until the end of the Second World War.\n\nSince the 1970s, Bayern's main rivals have been the clubs who put up the strongest fight against its national dominance. In the 1970s, this was Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, in the 1980s, the category expanded to include Hamburger SV. In the 1990s, Borussia Dortmund, Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen emerged as the most ardent opponents. Since the 2000s, Borussia Dortmund, Schalke 04, and Werder Bremen have been the main challengers in the Bundesliga. Bayern and Dortmund also have played against each other in the DFB-Pokal final in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2016. The 5\u20132 loss against Dortmund in the 2012 final was Bayern's worst ever loss in a DFB-Pokal final. The highlight of the rivalry between the two clubs was when Bayern defeated Dortmund 2\u20131 in the final of the 2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League.\nAmongst Bayern's chief European rivals are Real Madrid, AC Milan, and Manchester United. Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches. Due to Bayern being traditionally hard to beat for Madrid, Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\"). Despite the number of duels, Bayern and Real have never met in the final of a Champions League or European Cup."

From 2016 to 2019, Uli Hoene\u00df served as the club's president, following Karl Hopfner who had been in office from 2014; Hoene\u00df had resigned in 2014 after being convicted of tax fraud. Oliver Kahn was chairman of the executive board of the AG. The supervisory board of nine consists mostly of managers of big German corporations. Besides the club's president and the board's chairman, they are Herbert Hainer former CEO of (Adidas), Dr. Herbert Diess chairman of (Volkswagen), Dr. Werner Zedelius senior advisor at (Allianz), Timotheus H\u00f6ttges CEO of (Deutsche Telekom), Dieter Mayer, Edmund Stoiber, Theodor Weimer CEO of (Deutsche B\u00f6rse), and Dr. Michael Diederich speaker of the board at (UniCredit Bank).Professional football at Bayern is run by the spin-off organisation FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen AG. AG is short for Aktiengesellschaft, and Bayern is run like a joint stock company, a company whose stock are not listed on the public stock exchange, but is privately owned. 75 per cent of FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen AG is owned by the club, the FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen e. V. (e. V. is short for Eingetragener Verein, which translates into \"Registered Club\"). Three German corporations, the sports goods manufacturer Adidas, the automobile company Audi and the financial services group Allianz each hold 8.33 per cent of the shares, 25 per cent in total. Adidas acquired its shares in 2002 for \u20ac77 million. The money was designated to help finance the Allianz Arena. In 2009, Audi paid \u20ac90 million for their share. The capital was used to repay the loan on the Allianz Arena. And in early 2014, Allianz became the third shareholder of the company acquiring theirs share for \u20ac110 million. With the sale, Bayern paid off the remaining debt on the Allianz Arena 16 years ahead of schedule. Bayern's other sports departments are run by the club.\nBayern's shirt sponsor is Deutsche Telekom. Deutsche Telekom has been Bayern's shirt sponsor since the start of 2002\u201303 season. The company extended their sponsorship deal in August 2015 until the end of the 2026\u201327 season. Previous kit sponsors were Adidas (1974\u201378), Magirus Deutz and Iveco (1978\u201384), Commodore (1984\u201389) and Opel (1989\u20132002). Bayern's kit manufacturer is Adidas, who have been Bayern's kit manufacturer since 1974. The deal with Adidas runs until the end of the 2029\u201330 season.Bayern is an exception in professional football, having generated profits for 27 consecutive years. Other clubs often report losses, realising transfers via loans, whereas Bayern always uses current assets. In the 2019 edition of the Deloitte Football Money League, Bayern had the fourth-highest revenue in club football, generating revenue of \u20ac629.2 million. Bayern had the second-highest commercial revenue in the 2019 Deloitte Football Money League, behind only Real Madrid. Bayern's commercial revenue was \u20ac348.7 million (55 per cent of total revenue). In contrast, Bayern's matchday revenue trails other top clubs at \u20ac103.8 million (17 per cent of their total revenue). In 2017, Forbes ranks Bayern as the world's fourth-most valuable football club in their annual list, estimating the club's value at \u20ac2.5 billion.While other European clubs have mainly marketed to international audiences, Bayern had focused on Germany. Since the 2010s, Bayern have started to focus their marketing more on Asia and the United States. Bayern made summer tours to the United States in 2014 and 2016. Bayern went to China in the summer of 2015 and returned in the summer of 2017, where they also played games in Singapore. In August 2014, Bayern opened an office in New York City as the club wants to strengthen their brand positioning against other top European clubs in the United States. In March 2017, Bayern opened an office in Shanghai, China."

In the wake of the 2004 Indian ocean Tsunami the \"FC Bayern \u2013 Hilfe e.V.\" was founded, a foundation that aims to concentrate the social engagements of the club. At its inception, this venture was funded with \u20ac600,000, raised by officials and players of the club. The money was, amongst other things, used to build a school in Marathenkerny, Sri Lanka, and to rebuild the area of Trincomalee, Sri Lanka.The club has also assisted other sport clubs in financial disarray. The club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with player transfers at favourable rates and direct money transfers. When St. Pauli threatened to lose its licence for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game, giving all gate receipts to St. Pauli. In 1993, Alexander Zickler transferred from Dynamo Dresden to Bayern for 2.3 Million DM, with many considering the sum to have been a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners. In 2003, Bayern provided a \u20ac2 Million loan to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund. In 2009, Mark van Bommel's home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress; Bayern played a charity game at the Dutch club, gifting them gate receipts. In 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division side Hansa Rostock. The game raised about \u20ac1 million, securing Hansa's licence. In 2017, Bayern played a benefit match against financial troubled Kickers Offenbach, with all gate receipts going to Kickers Offenbach. Two years later, Bayern played a benefit match against Kaiserslautern. The match was played so Kaiserslautern could secure their licence to play in the German third division. All income from the match went to Kaiserslautern. In March 2020, Bayern, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and Bayer Leverkusen, the four German UEFA Champions League teams for the 2019\u201320 season, collectively gave \u20ac20 million to Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams that were struggling financially during the COVID-19 pandemic.In mid-2013, Bayern was the first club to give financial support to the Magnus Hirschfeld National Foundation. The foundation researches the living environment LGBT people, and developed an education concept to facilitate unbiased dealing with LGBT themes in football. In 2016, Bayern received the Nine Values Cup, an award of the international children's social programme Football for Friendship."

The trampolines allow the players to bounce high enough to spike the ball over the net.\nThe word \"bossa\", which is sometimes translated as \"style, flair or attitude\" in Indian Spanish, is commonly associated with Bossa Nova, a samba-influenced type of Brazilian music. The name Bossaball, therefore, expresses the aim to combine sports, music, and positive vibrations.Some other countries where Bossaball has been introduced include: Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Turkey, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Portugal, Greece, Austria, Italy, Slovenia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Singapore, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Paraguay."

        "content": "A Bossaball game is played between two teams of four players. The aim is for each team to ground the ball on the opponent's field. The height of the net in between both fields can be adjusted for different levels, such as professionals, intermediates, beginners, or children. Players are not allowed to touch the net and always have to remain with at least one body part on their own side.One player (the attacker) is positioned on the trampoline, and the others are around him/her on the inflatables. A player from the serving team (the server) throws or kicks the ball into the air and attempts to hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team's court (the serve). The opposing team must make a combination of no more than five contacts with the ball to return it to the other side of the net. These contacts can be exercised using any body part: \n\nVolley touchTouching the ball one single time according to the traditional volleyball rules. With the lower arms, touch, spike or drop shot. Throwing the ball or guiding the ball for more than 1 second is not allowed.\nFootball touchTouching the ball up to two times (= double football touch or a DST) with any body part except the hands or arms. Example: One can control the ball with the chest and then pass it with the head or foot. Any combination of body parts is allowed as long as none of the two contacts is with the hands or arms. A DST is counted as one pass.Of the five maximum contacts, the ball has to be played at least once using the football touch technique, once the second pass has been played.\n\nDuring a rally, the ball is tossed around while the attacker jumps on the trampoline in order to gain height. The attack begins when one of the rallying players aims the ball's trajectory towards a spot in the air where the attacker can hit it (spike or kick it) and return the ball over the net.\nThe team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on offense. The team on defence attempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court; the players at the net jump and reach above the top (and across the plane) of the net in order to block the attacked ball. If the ball is hit around, above, or through the block, the defensive players arranged in the rest of the court attempt to control the ball with a dig (usually a forearm pass of a hard-driven ball, or a foot control). After a successful dig, the team transitions to offense.\nThe game continues in this manner, rallying back and forth, until the ball touches the court within the scoring zones or a mistake is committed.\nThe role of a referee in Bossaball is similar to that in volleyball. Competition games are played with three referees: one primary and two assistants. The main referee stands under the net in the playing area. He or she is responsible for the final decisions and especially focuses on the net. The two assistant referees are positioned at opposite corners of the court. They have to keep track of the maximum number of touches (the soccer touch) and decide if the ball is in or out of bounds."

When the ball lies still on the bossawall, the point goes to the opponent's team.\nScoring with volley touch:\n1 point: when the ball hits the opponents playing area.\n3 points: when the ball is played directly in the opponent's trampoline area.Scoring with football touch (any part of the body except hands):\n3 points: when the ball hits the opponents playing area.\n5 points: when the ball is played directly in the opponent's trampoline area.The team that scored, serves next point.

Batroun was mentioned by the ancient geographers Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy, Stephanus of Byzantium, and Hierocles. Theophanes the Confessor called the city \"Bostrys.\"The Phoenicians founded Batroun on the southern side of the promontory called in classical antiquity Theoprosopon and during the Byzantine Empire, Cape Lithoprosopon. Batroun is said to have been founded by Ithobaal I (Ethbaal), king of Tyre (whose daughter Jezabel married Ahab).\nThe city was under Roman rule to Phoenice Province, and later after the region was Christianized became a suffragan of the Patriarch of Antioch.\nIn 551, Batroun was destroyed by an earthquake,  which also caused mudslides and made the Cape Lithoprosopon  crack.  Historians believe that Batroun's large natural harbor was formed during the earthquake.Three Greek Orthodox bishops are known to have come from Batroun: Porphyrius in 451, Elias about 512 and Stephen in 553 (Lequien, II, 827). According to a Greek Notitia episcopatuum, the Greek Orthodox See has existed in Batroun since the tenth century when the city was then called Petrounion. After the Muslim conquests of the region, the name was Arabicized to Batroun.\nBatroun was controlled by the Crusaders in 1104, to be known as the Lordship of Botrun as part of the County of Tripoli, until it was conquered by the Mamluk Sultanate in 1289. One of Batroun's archaeological sites is Mseilha Fort, which is constructed on an isolated massive rock with steep sides protruding in the middle of a plain surrounded by mountains.Under Ottoman rule, Batroun was the centre of a kaza in the mutessariflik of Lebanon and the seat of a Maronite diocese, suffragan to the Maronite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch. Since 1999, it has been the seat of the Maronite eparchy."

Population 2,379 (2011).\nWhen exactly Anogeia was founded and by whom, is not accurately known. Many believe that the original settlement was founded by villagers from the village Axos, which is west of Anogia, where the Minoan city Oaxos was.\nAccording to a legend, a shepherd from Axos found one day on one of the slopes of Psiloreitis an icon depicting Saint John the Baptist. Pious as he was, he picked it up carefully, wrapped it in a towel, took it to his home and placed it there alongside the other icons. On the following day he was astonished to find out that the icon had disappeared. Terrified, he returned to the place he had found it the previous day, where he was exhilarated to discover the icon in the exact same place. This inexplicable phenomenon was considered to be an order from the heavens, to build there a temple dedicated to Saint John the Baptist.\nThe church of Saint John seems to be the first building of the settlement, which later came to be known as \"Anogia\". Within the temple of Saint John are remains of Byzantine drawings on the walls, which date to the 11th century.\nThe historian Stelios Spanakis, summarily provides geographical, as well as historical information about Anogia,: \u201cAnogia is a town \u2013municipality in the Mylopotamos Province of the Prefecture of Rethymno. In the 1981 census it numbered 2.449 citizens. It is in the northern reaches of Psiloreitis, at an altitude of 700-790 meters. When in 1182 Crete was divided among the 12 Young Princes of Byzantium, Anogia were given to the family of Fokas. Anogia are referred to by Venetian and Greek scholars and historians as Anogia, or Anoia. In 1593 it was already a significant settlement, numbering 911 citizens. Anogia are referred to as a revolutionary place during the years of Turkish occupation. In 1822, when the Anogians were fighting the Turks in Messara, Serif Pasha found the village empty and put it to the torch. In November 1866, during the Great Cretan Revolt, Resit Pasha tried to capture Anogia, but he was repulsed by the Anogians and other villagers from Mylopotamos.\u201d  This tradition continued during the German occupation and in August 1944 the village was once again razed to the ground in reprisal for the local's participation in the resistance.\nThe living conditions of the people of Anogia, as well as those of other mountain villages in Crete, were extremely difficult. Anogians of old times were mainly shepherds, goatherds and not so many of them were farmers. The barren soil, the harsh winters, the frequent revolts and the constant purges from the conquerors contributed to the primitive living conditions, to the great poverty and the lack of even the most basic of comforts.\nThe French historian Victor Berard (1897) during his journeys in Crete, dedicated but a few lines for the village of Anogia, where with a raw and laconic way describes the hopeless living conditions of the time: \u201cThe village Anogia, resembles the outposts on the remote peaks of old, where men and animals live together in miserable hovels\u201d.\nThe Italian Vittorio Simonelli who visited Crete in 1893, was much more generous in his descriptions. First, he was put up at a \u201ctolerable inn\u201d. As for the villagers themselves, both men and women, made a great impression on him, when on a Sunday he saw them going to the church. He wrote: \u201cAnogian women are beautiful, with red cheeks and faces that are lit up by eyes black and shiny, like agate. Their traditional clothing, accentuates the health and beauty that characterize the ancient Cretan archetype. The men are also handsome, being tall, lean, and easy in their movement, proud, but without even a trace of ferociousness\u201d.\nIn recent years, the Yakinthia (Hyacinthia) cultural festival is held at an altitude of 1200m in the Nida Plateau, south of Anogeia. The festival is held annually every July and focuses on the Cretan folk tradition and its blending with the traditions of Greece and the Mediterranean."

In retaliation, on August 13, 1944, the commander of Fortress Crete  M\u00fcller ordered the demolition of Anogia and annihilation of every male from Anogia in a radius of 1 kilometre. Thus, on August 13 of 1944, three battalions of German troops surrounded Anogia and set garrisons in the surrounding hills. They arrested 80 elders and sent them to Heraklion and executed nine disabled persons, all others were evacuated to the surrounding mountains. They blew up every single house with dynamite, and started an arson, about 800 houses became rubble and they burned 6 elderly disabled women. The remaining men fled to Mount Psiloritis to safety.\nBetween 1941 and 1944, during the fight against the German invaders, a total of 104 Anogians were killed .\nIn 1946, the state honored Anogia with the award of the War Cross first class for the disasters which affected and for their heroism. The following year, the community, honoris causa, was recognized as Anogeia."
