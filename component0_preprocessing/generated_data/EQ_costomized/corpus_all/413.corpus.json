He pitched from 1991 to 2002 for three teams, the majority of which for the Houston Astros. Kile was known for his sharp, big-breaking curveball. He died at the age of 33 of coronary artery disease in 2002 in Chicago, where he and the Cardinals were staying for a weekend series against the Chicago Cubs. He was the first active major league player to die during the regular season since 1979, when the New York Yankees' Thurman Munson died in a plane crash."

He attenderd Norco High School in Norco, California, where his awkward frame and low pitch velocityhis four-seam fastball topping out at meant that he was mostly overlooked by college recruiters and scouts. In 1987, after graduating from Norco, Kile enrolled at Chaffey Junior College in Rancho Cucamonga, California, and joined their college baseball team as a walk-on. Between his freshman and sophomore year of college, Kile underwent a growth spurt that took him from  to , helped him gain , and added  to his fastball."

Having been successful with the Tucson Toros, the Astros' AAA club in the Pacific Coast League, Kile entered the majors in 1991, going 7\u201311 in 22 starts. In his first major league start on April 24, 1991, Kile had a no-hitter going when he was lifted after six innings by manager Art Howe, who wanted to protect the 22-year-old rookie's arm. Kile's breakthrough year came in 1993 when he went 15\u20138 with a 3.51 earned run average and made the All-Star team. On September 8, Kile pitched a no-hitter against the New York Mets. He pitched seven seasons with the Astros, mostly as a starter. Another strong season was 1997, when he went 19\u20137, compiled a 2.57 ERA, made the All-Star team again, threw a career-high  innings, and pitched four shutouts. He finished fifth in voting for the NL Cy Young Award. Kile made his first postseason appearance in Game 1 of the 1997 National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, giving up only two hits but suffering a hard-luck 2\u20131 loss. Atlanta swept Houston in the best-of-five series."

        "content": "In 1998, Kile signed with the Colorado Rockies as a free agent. Kile suffered control problems, allowing hitters to lay off his curveball. After two seasons in which he was a combined 21\u201330 and posted ERAs of 5.20 and 6.61, Kile was traded to the Cardinals. In his first season with St. Louis, Kile went 20\u20139, becoming the first Cardinal pitcher since John Tudor and Joaqu\u00edn And\u00fajar in 1985 to win 20 games in a season. He made his third All-Star team and again finished fifth in NL Cy Young Award voting. He earned the first playoff victory of his career in Game 2 of the 2000 NLDS against Atlanta, but suffered two losses in the NL Championship Series, which the Cardinals lost to the Mets in five games. Kile went 16\u201311 in 2001, and the Cardinals made the playoffs again, losing to the eventual world champion Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLDS. Kile was the starting pitcher for Game 3 and received a no-decision. Kile threw  innings and compiled a 3.09 ERA that season, despite having an injured shoulder which required surgery after the Cardinals were eliminated from the playoffs. He spent the offseason rehabilitating and was ready for the start of the 2002 season. In 12 seasons as a major league pitcher, Kile never went on the disabled list. On June 18, Kile pitched in an interleague game against the Anaheim Angels, scattering six hits over  innings, allowing one run. He exited the game in the eighth inning to a standing ovation. Kile and the Cardinals won the game, 7\u20132, and moved into first place in the NL's Central Division, a spot they held for the rest of the 2002 season."

        "content": "On June 22, 2002, during pregame warmups for what would have been a day game in Chicago against the rival Cubs, team personnel noted Kile's absence. Hotel staff entered Kile's room and discovered him in his bed, under the covers, dead of a heart attack. An autopsy determined that the cause of death was a 90% blockage in two coronary arteries. Kile's death came four days after the death of longtime Cardinal broadcaster Jack Buck. The details leading up to and following Kile's death are detailed to some degree in Buzz Bissinger's book, Three Nights in August. An entire chapter is dedicated to Kile. Cubs catcher Joe Girardi announced at Wrigley Field that the afternoon's game versus the Cardinals had been cancelled, though he did not announce that the cancellation was prompted by Kile's death. Girardi tearfully gave the news at 2:37\u00a0pm CDT, broadcast regionally on Fox: \"Excuse me. I thank you for your patience. We regret to inform you because of a tragedy in the Cardinal family, that the commissioner has cancelled the game today. Please be respectful. You will find out eventually what has happened, and I ask that you say a prayer for the Cardinals' family.\" The game was rescheduled and made up later in the year on August 31, a 10\u20134 Cardinal defeat. Jason Simontacchi, who pitched for the Cardinals, was visibly emotional during the game since Kile was a mentor to him. Later that season, when the Cardinals clinched the Central Division championship in a game against the Astros, teammate Albert Pujols carried Kile's #57 jersey, on a hanger, to the celebration on the field. Kile was survived by his wife, Flynn, his twins, daughter Sierra and son Kannon, and son Ryker."

        "content": "The Cardinals honored Kile by placing a small \"DK 57\" sign in the home bullpen. This sign was carried over to the new Busch Stadium and remains today. The team wrote \"DK 57\" on their hats. The team put chalk and markers in the Busch Stadium concourses so fans could write similar messages on their caps. In the All-Star Game, Cardinals pitcher Matt Morris wrote DK 57 on his hands and held them up when they announced his name in honor of his fallen teammate and close friend. Since Kile's death, the Astros, Rockies, and Cardinals have not assigned number 57 to another player, although none of those teams has formally retired the number. The Cardinals were the first of the three teams to re-issue the number, doing so in 2020, giving it to pitcher Zack Thompson. The Astros honored Kile with a memorial plaque that hangs along the left field wall at Minute Maid Park under the 1997 Central Division Championship banner, the last season Kile played for Houston before signing with Colorado. The Rockies have a memorial near the bullpens. It is circular, says \"DK 57\", and is on pinstripes. In 2003, the Darryl Kile Good Guy Award was established and is presented annually to the Astros player and Cardinals player who best exemplify Kile's traits of \"a good teammate, a great friend, a fine father and a humble man\". The winners are selected, respectively, by the Houston and St. Louis chapters of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. The first recipients of the award were Jeff Bagwell and Mike Matheny of the Astros and Cardinals, respectively. Kile was given an exemption by the Baseball Writers' Association of America and placed on the ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2003. With seven votes, he was eliminated from future BBWAA ballot consideration."

        "content": "Christopher Mathewson (August 12, 1880 \u2013 October 7, 1925), nicknamed \"Big Six\", \"The Christian Gentleman\", \"Matty\", and \"The Gentleman's Hurler\", was a Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher, who played 17 seasons with the New York Giants. He stood  tall and weighed . He was among the most dominant pitchers in baseball history, and ranks in the all-time top 10 in several key pitching categories, including wins, shutouts, and earned run average. In 1936, Mathewson was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its first five members. Mathewson grew up in Factoryville, Pennsylvania, and began playing semiprofessional baseball when he was 14 years old. He played in the minor leagues in 1899, recording a record of 21 wins and two losses. He pitched for the New York Giants the next season, but was sent back to the minors. He eventually returned to the Giants, and went on to win 373 games in his career, a National League record. He led the Giants to victory in the 1905 World Series by pitching three shutouts. Mathewson never pitched on Sundays, owing to his Christian beliefs. Mathewson served in the United States Army's Chemical Warfare Service in World War I, and was accidentally exposed to chemical weapons during training. His respiratory system was weakened from the exposure, causing him to contract tuberculosis, from which he died in Saranac Lake, New York, in 1925."

He was also a member of the fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta. His first experience of semi-professional baseball came in 1895, when he was just 14 years old. The manager of the Factoryville ball club asked him to pitch in a game with a rival team in Mill City, Pennsylvania. Mathewson helped his hometown team to a 19\u201317 victory, but with his batting rather than his pitching. He continued to play baseball during his years at Bucknell, pitching for minor league teams in Honesdale and Meridian, Pennsylvania. Mathewson was selected to the Walter Camp All-American football team in 1900. He was a drop-kicker."

In July of that year, the New York Giants purchased his contract from Norfolk for $1,500 (). Between July and September 1900, Mathewson appeared in six games for the Giants. He started one of those games and compiled a 0\u20133 record. Displeased with his performance, the Giants returned him to Norfolk and demanded their money back. Later that month, the Cincinnati Reds picked up Mathewson off the Norfolk roster. On December 15, 1900, the Reds quickly traded Mathewson back to the Giants for Amos Rusie."

While a member of the New York Giants, Mathewson played fullback for the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League. However, Mathewson disappeared from the team in the middle of the team's 1902 season. Some historians speculate that the Giants got word that their star pitcher was risking his baseball career for the Stars and ordered him to stop, while others feel that the Stars' coach, Willis Richardson, got rid of Mathewson because he felt that, since the fullback's punting skills were hardly used, he could replace him with a local player, Shirley Ellis."

        "content": "During his 17-year career, Mathewson won 373 games and lost 188 for a .665 winning percentage. His career earned run average of 2.13 and 79 career shutouts are among the best all time for pitchers, and his 373 wins are still number one in the National League, tied with Grover Cleveland Alexander. He employed a good fastball, outstanding control, and, especially a new pitch he termed the \"fadeaway\" (later known in baseball as the \"screwball\"), which he learned from teammate Dave Williams in 1898. This reference is challenged by Ken Burns documentary Baseball in which it is stated that Mathewson learned his \"fadeaway\" from Andrew \"Rube\" Foster when New York Giants manager John McGraw quietly hired Rube to show the Giants bullpen what he knew. Many baseball historians consider this story apocryphal. Mathewson recorded 2,507 career strikeouts against only 848 walks. He is famous for his 25 pitching duels with Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown, who won 13 of the duels against Mathewson's 11, with one no-decision. Mathewson was a very good-hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .215 batting average (362-for-1687) with 151 runs, seven home runs, and 167 runs batted in. In 10 of his 17 years in the majors, he was in double figures in runs batted in, with a season-high of 20 in 1903. He batted .281 (9-for-32) in 11 World Series games. By 1903, Mathewson's stature was such that when he briefly signed a contract with the St. Louis Browns of the American League, he was thought to be the spark the Browns needed to win the pennant. The Browns had finished a strong second in 1902, five games behind the Philadelphia Athletics. They offered him four times what he was making with the Giants. However, as part of the settlement that ended the two-year war between the American and National Leagues, Mathewson and Browns owner Robert Lee Hedges tore up the contract. Hedges later said that ensuring the return of peace to the game was more important, even if it meant effectively giving up a pennant. From 1900 to 1904, Mathewson established himself as a premier pitcher. Posting low earned run averages and winning nearly 100 games, Mathewson helped lead the Giants to their first National League title in 1903, and a berth in first World Series. Though no World Series was held in 1904, the Giants captured the pennant, prompting McGraw to proclaim them as the best team in the world. Mathewson strove even harder in 1905. After switching to catcher, Roger Bresnahan had begun collaborating with Mathewson, whose advanced memory of hitter weaknesses paved the way for a historic season. Pinpoint control guided Mathewson's pitches to Bresnahan's glove. In 338 innings, Mathewson walked only 64 batters. He shut out opposing teams eight times, pitching entire games in brief 90-minute sessions. Besides winning 31 games, Mathewson allowed only 1.28 earned runs for every nine innings. His 206 strikeouts led the league, earning him the Triple Crown. Mathewson's Giants won the 1905 World Series over the Philadelphia Athletics. Mathewson was the starting pitcher in game one, and pitched a four-hit shutout for the victory. Three days later, with the series tied 1\u20131, he pitched another four-hit shutout. Then, two days later in game five, he threw a six-hit shutout to clinch the series for the Giants. In a span of only six days, Mathewson had pitched three complete games without allowing a run, while giving up only 14 hits. The next year, Mathewson lost much of his edge, owing to an early-season diagnosis of diphtheria. McGraw pulled over 260 innings from him, but these were plagued with struggle. Though he maintained a 22\u201312 record, his 2.97 earned run average was well above the league average of 2.62. His 1.271 walks plus hits per innings pitched, quite uncharacteristic of him, was due to an increased number of hits and walks. By 1908, Mathewson was back on top as the league's elite pitcher. Winning the most games of his career, 37, coupled with a 1.43 earned run average and 259 strikeouts, he claimed a second triple crown. He also led the league in starts, innings pitched, complete games, and shutouts, and held hitters to an exceptionally low 0.827 walks plus hits per innings pitched. He even led the league in saves, racking up 5 of them in 12 relief appearances. Unfortunately, the Giants were unable to take home the pennant due to what was ultimately known as Merkle's Boner, an incident that cost the Giants a crucial game against the Chicago Cubs, who eventually defeated the Giants in the standings by one game. Mathewson returned for an outstanding 1909 season; though not as dominant as the previous year, he posted a better earned run average (1.14), and a record of 25-6. He repeated a strong performance in 1910 and then again in 1911, when the Giants captured their first pennant since 1905. The Giants ultimately lost the 1911 World Series to the Philadelphia Athletics, the same team they had defeated for the 1905 championship. Mathewson and Rube Marquard allowed two game-winning home runs to Hall of Famer Frank Baker, earning him the nickname, \"Home Run\". Mathewson, the team's \"star pitcher\", signed a three-year contract with the Giants in late 1910, for the upcoming 1911, 1912 and 1913 seasons, the first time he had signed a contract over a year in length. In 1912, Mathewson gave another stellar performance. Capturing the pennant, the Giants were fueled by the stolen-base game and a superior pitching staff capped by Rube Marquard, the \"11,000-dollar lemon\" who turned around to win 26 games, 19 of them consecutively. In the 1912 World Series, the Giants faced the Boston Red Sox, the 1904 American League pennant winners who would have faced the Giants in the World Series that year had one been played. Though Mathewson threw three complete games and maintained an earned run average below 1.00, numerous errors by the Giants, including a lazy popup dropped by Fred Snodgrass in the eighth game (Game 2 was a tie), cost them the championship. The Giants also lost the 1913 World Series, a 101-win season cemented by Mathewson's final brilliant season on the mound: a league-leading 2.06 earned run average in over 300 innings pitched complemented by 0.6 bases on balls per nine innings pitched. For the remainder of his career with the Giants, Mathewson began to struggle. Soon, the former champions fell into decline. In 1915, Mathewson's penultimate season in New York, the Giants were the worst team in the National League standings. Mathewson, who had expressed interest in serving as a manager, wound up with a three-year deal to manage the Cincinnati Reds effective July 21, 1916."

However, he appeared in only one game as a pitcher for the Reds, on September 4, 1916. He faced Brown in the second half of a doubleheader, which was billed as the final meeting between the two old baseball warriors. The high-scoring game was a win for Mathewson's Reds over Brown's Cubs, 10\u20138. Mathewson retired as a player after the season and managed the Reds for the entire 1917 season and the first 118 games of 1918, compiling a total record of 164-176 as a manager."

        "content": "Mathewson married Jane Stoughton (1880\u20131967) in 1903. Their only son, Christopher Jr., was born shortly after. Christy Mathewson Jr. served in World War II, and died in an explosion at his home in Texas on August 16, 1950. During Mathewson's playing years, the family lived in a duplex in upper Manhattan alongside Mathewson's manager John McGraw and his wife Blanche. Mathewson and McGraw remained friends for the rest of their lives. In the 1909 offseason, Christy Mathewson's younger brother Nicholas Mathewson committed suicide in a neighbor's barn. Another brother, Henry Mathewson, pitched briefly for the Giants before dying of tuberculosis in 1917. Mathewson was highly regarded in the baseball world during his lifetime. As he was a clean-cut, intellectual collegiate, his rise to fame brought a better name to the typical ballplayer, who usually spent his time gambling, boozing, or womanizing. As noted in The National League Story (1961) by Lee Allen, Mathewson was a devout Christian and never pitched on Sunday, a promise he made to his mother that brought him popularity among the more religious New York fans and earned him the nickname \"The Christian Gentleman\". However, the impact of this practice on the Giants was minimized, since, in the eight-team National League, only the Chicago Cubs (Illinois), Cincinnati Reds (Ohio), and St. Louis Cardinals (Missouri) played home games in states that allowed professional sports on Sunday. In his free time, Mathewson enjoyed nature walks, reading, golf, and checkers, of which he was a renowned champion player. The combination of athletic skill and intellectual hobbies made him a favorite for many fans, even those opposed to the Giants. Sportswriters praised him, and in his prime every game he started began with deafening cheers. Sometimes, the distraction prompted him to walk out 10 minutes after his fielders took the field. Mathewson soon became the unspoken captain of the Giants. He was the only player to whom John McGraw ever gave full discretion. McGraw told many younger players to watch and listen to his wisdom. Mathewson garnered respect throughout the baseball world as a pitcher of great sportsmanship. He was often asked to write columns concerning upcoming games. In 1912, with the editing and ghostwriting aid of sportswriter John Wheeler, Mathewson published his classic memoir Pitching in a Pinch, or Pitching from the Inside, which was admired by poet Marianne Moore and is still in print. Years later, Mathewson co-wrote a mildly successful play called The Girl and The Pennant, which was inspired by Helene Hathaway Britton's ownership of the St. Louis Cardinals. Mathewson went on to pursue more literary endeavors ending in 1917 with a children's book called Second Base Sloan. One of the journalists to unmask the 1919 Black Sox, Hugh Fullerton, consulted Mathewson for information about baseball gambling. Fullerton trusted Mathewson for his writing intellect, as well as his unbiased standpoint. As a player and manager, Mathewson also had several seasons of experience playing alongside Hal Chase, a veteran major league player widely rumored to have been involved in several gambling incidents and attempts to fix games. Representing the only former ballplayer among the group of investigating journalists, Mathewson played a small role in Fullerton's exposure of the 1919 World Series scandal."

He served overseas as a captain in the newly formed Chemical Service along with Ty Cobb. When he arrived in France, he was accidentally gassed during a chemical training exercise and subsequently developed tuberculosis, which more easily infects lungs that have been damaged by chemical gases. Mathewson served with the American Expeditionary Forces until February 1919 and was discharged later that month. Although he returned to serve as a coach for the Giants from 1919 to 1921, he spent a good portion of that time in Saranac Lake fighting the tuberculosis, initially at the Trudeau Sanitorium, and later in a house that he had built. In 1923, Mathewson returned to professional baseball when Giants attorney Emil Fuchs and he put together a syndicate that bought the Boston Braves. Although initial plans called for Mathewson to be principal owner and team president, his health had deteriorated so much that he could perform only nominal duties. He turned over the presidency to Fuchs after the season."

He died in Saranac Lake of tuberculosis on October 7, 1925. Mathewson is buried at Lewisburg Cemetery in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, adjacent to Bucknell University. Members of the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Washington Senators wore black armbands during the 1925 World Series. Mathewson had died on the day the series began, October 7. According to Baseball, some of Mathewson's last words were to his wife: \"Now Jane, I want you to go outside and have yourself a good cry. Don't make it a long one; this can't be helped.\" Christy Mathewson Day is celebrated as a holiday in his hometown of Factoryville, Pennsylvania, on the Saturday closest to his birthday. Christy Mathewson Day and Factoryville, Pennsylvania, are the subjects of the documentary, Christy Mathewson Day. Bucknell's football stadium is named \"Christy Mathewson\u2013Memorial Stadium\". The baseball field at Keystone College is named \"Christy Mathewson Field\". Christy Mathewson Park in Factoryville is home to the community's Little League field, as well as basketball courts and other athletic facilities, public gardens, walking trails, and a picnic pavilion. The former Whittenton Ballfield in Taunton, Massachusetts, is named in memory of Christy Mathewson, who played for the Taunton team in the New England Baseball League before he joined the New York Giants. Mathewson is mentioned in the poem \"Line-Up for Yesterday\" by Ogden Nash. F. Scott Fitzgerald refers to Christy Mathewson in his first novel, This Side of Paradise (1920). Jazz pianist Dave Frishberg, composer of several baseball-themed songs, wrote one called \"Matty\" for Mathewson. Mathewson is a central character in Eric Rolfe Greenberg's historical novel The Celebrant, which chronicles turn-of-the-century American life by weaving together Mathewson's story with the life of an immigrant Jewish family in New York. In 2002, the book was selected as one of the top 100 sports books of all time by Sports Illustrated."

        "content": "Puhl was called up to the majors in July 1977, and never returned to the minor leagues. He was quickly installed as the club's regular left fielder, replacing Jim Fuller. In his first major league game, on July 12, Puhl entered as a defensive replacement for Fuller. The following day, he got his first hit in the 13th inning of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, off reliever El\u00edas Sosa. Later that inning, Puhl scored the winning run on Bob Watson's double. He finished the 1977 season with a .301 batting average in 60 games. The following year, he was the sole Astro selected as a National League All-Star. He played in 149 games and batted .289 while having 169 hits, 25 doubles, and 32 stolen bases (the most he would ever have in a season). The following year, he would play 157 games (the most he would play in one season) while having his numbers rise and drop slightly, such as batting .287/.352/.377 while having 172 hits, 22 doubles, 49 RBIs, and 30 stolen bases. Puhl played a key part in the Astros making 1980 a banner year. He played in 141 games while batting .282 with 151 hits, 24 doubles, and 27 stolen bases. In the 1980 National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, Puhl set a then NL-championship series record with a .526 batting average in a losing cause, the best performance ever by a hitter in a play-off series (it has since been superseded). As of 2019, Puhl has the 19th best lifetime fielding percentage by an outfielder (.993). He committed only 18 errors in 2,660 total chances. In 1981, he was named Canadian Baseball player of the year. That year, he played in 96 games while batting .251 while having 88 hits, 19 doubles, and 22 stolen bases. Puhl recorded his 1,000th hit off Tim Lollar on August 4, 1984, doing so on a single. A pulled hamstring in 1985 and an ankle injury in 1986 reduced Puhl's playing time. He would play just 57 games in 1985, 81 in 1986, and 90 in 1987 (batting .284, .244, and .230 respectively). He would have one more return to effective hitting in 1988, batting .303/.395/.389 in 113 games, having 71 hits and 22 stolen bases. Puhl was granted free agent status in 1990, and signed with the New York Mets on December 13, 1990. He was released by the Mets during spring training on April 1, 1991, and signed by the Kansas City Royals on April 25, 1991. Puhl's final MLB game was on May 29, 1991, after which he was released by the Royals on June 9, ending his MLB career. Puhl's career statistics included a .280 batting average, 62 home runs, 676 runs, 435 RBIs, and 217 stolen bases. He accumulated 1,361 hits in 1,531 games. Puhl was particularly effective in postseason play, batting .372 in 13 games over three series. As of 2020, Puhl still ranks in the top ten in numerous categories for the Astros, such as WAR (10th, 28.5), games played (5th, 1,516), and hits (8th, 1,357)."

Canada advanced to the next round of qualifiers in 2007. In a 15\u201312 defeat of Panama, Puhl replaced catcher David Corrente with pinch hitter Reed Eastley in the eighth inning, despite the fact that Corrente had four hits in four at bats. Eastley hit a three-run home run to tie the game. In the bottom of the ninth, Reed Eastley came to bat for a second time, this time with the bases loaded and the game on the line. Puhl instead called on pinch hitter Jeremy Ware, whose grand slam won the game for Canada. In November 2006, Puhl was announced as the first head baseball coach at the University of Houston\u2013Victoria. The UHV Jaguars were previously an independent team of the NAIA, but beginning in the 2015-16 season will compete as a member of the NAIA's Red River Athletic Conference. He won his 300th career game on January 30, 2021. Puhl's son, Stephen Puhl, was a minor league baseball player. Selected in the 17th round (514th overall) of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Mets, Stephen was a catcher in the Mets system in 2006 and then pitched for the organization in 2007 and 2008.

        "content": "Rivaldo V\u00edtor Borba Ferreira (born 19 April 1972), known as Rivaldo (), is a Brazilian former professional footballer. He played mainly as an attacking midfielder but also as a second striker. He is regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. Labelled a \"bandy-legged genius\" by The Guardian (due to being bowlegged), although he was predominantly left footed he was capable of playing on either flank, and was on occasion deployed as a wide midfielder or as a winger. Rivaldo spent five years with Spanish club Barcelona, where he formed a successful partnership with Patrick Kluivert, and won the 1998 and 1999 Spanish La Liga championship and the 1998 Copa del Rey. With 130 goals for Barcelona he is the club's ninth highest goalscorer. His three goals against Valencia in June 2001 which qualified Barcelona for the Champions League, the last goal of which was a last minute 20-yard bicycle kick winner, is often ranked the greatest hat-trick ever. From 1993 to 2003, Rivaldo played 74 matches and scored 35 goals for Brazil and is the seventh highest goalscorer. He helped Brazil reach the final of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and won the 1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica where he was named player of the tournament. Rivaldo starred in an attacking trio with Ronaldo and Ronaldinho in the 2002 FIFA World Cup winning team. Scoring in five of Brazil's seven games at the tournament (including a feint that set up Ronaldo for the second goal in the final), Rivaldo was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team in 2002 having also previously been selected in 1998. One of the most skillful and creative players of his generation, Rivaldo was renowned for his bending free kicks, bicycle kicks, feints, powerful ball striking from distance, and ability to both score and create goals. In 1999, he won the Ballon d'Or and was named FIFA World Player of the Year. In 2004, he was named by Pel\u00e9 in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. He is an inductee to the Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame. In March 2014, Rivaldo announced his retirement from professional football, however since June 2015 he made appearances for Mogi Mirim. On 14 August 2015, he announced that the comeback was over and that he was retiring once again to spend time in his home in Recife, named \u201cHitsville\u201d due to his great love of Motown music. He also supports the schools he set up in Chad under his charity, Give Kids a Chance in Chad. In 2015, he acted in the Iranian-Brazilian film I Am Not Salvador. In 2018, Rivaldo was added as an icon to the FIFA video game FIFA 19."

Predominantly left footed, Rivaldo began his professional career at the age of 16, when he signed with Paulistano Futebol Clube in 1989, despite the Paulistano coaches believing him too physically weak to succeed. Rivaldo's father Romildo was killed in a road accident in 1989, but Rivaldo signed his first professional contract later that year."

In his first season at Barcelona, Rivaldo was the second top goalscorer with 19 goals in 34 matches, as Barcelona won The Double of La Liga and Copa del Rey. In 1999, he won another La Liga title with Barcelona, and once again was the league's second highest scorer with 24 goals. In 1999, Rivaldo was named FIFA World Player of the Year and he also received the Ballon d'Or. After Barcelona's unsuccessful Champions League campaign, Rivaldo was linked with a move away from Camp Nou. Then Manchester United captain Roy Keane was reported stating Rivaldo was the player he most wanted United to sign. In his third season at Barcelona, Rivaldo fell out with manager Louis van Gaal, when he insisted playing as a playmaker rather than on the left wing. Even though he had a strained relationship with Van Gaal, Rivaldo went on to score 10 goals in the season's Champions League as the club reached the semi-finals. Van Gaal was fired in June 2000. In the following 2000\u201301 season, Rivaldo was once again the second highest goalscorer of the league, with 23 goals. In the last game of the season, against Valencia CF, Rivaldo scored a hat-trick to win the game 3\u20132. Frequently ranked the greatest hat-trick ever, his first goal was a trademark bending free kick that curled into the bottom right corner, the second saw him send the Valencia player the wrong way with a feint before a strike with little back-lift from 25 yards swerved into the bottom left corner of the net, and his match-winning third occurred after Rivaldo controlled the ball with the chest from the edge of the 18-yard box and executed an overhead bicycle kick in the 89th minute, which he regards as the best goal of his career. An ecstatic Rivaldo ripped off his jersey and started swinging it over his head during his goal celebrations, while Barcelona club president Joan Gaspart broke with convention in the stadium's VIP box by punching the air with both fists and yelling his delight next to the opposition delegation. The win pushed Barcelona ahead of Valencia to secure a place in the 2001\u201302 Champions League. After the game Rivaldo stated; \"What happened tonight has been incredible. I dedicate the winning goal to all the players who have fought so hard all season and all the supporters who have suffered so much. I'm delighted to have made them happy with my goals.\" He scored a total of 36 goals that season."

During the 2004\u201305 season he scored some stand out goals, one of them coming in his first derby against Panathinaikos that arguably turned out to be his most famous in an Olympiacos shirt: a bending free kick to send Olympiacos to victory over their eternal rivals. Another notable goal by Rivaldo came the following week in Olympiacos's matchday 6 UEFA Champions League group game in England against eventual champions Liverpool F.C. where he scored a deft free-kick in front of the Kop and put the Greek giants ahead. However Olympiacos were eliminated after Liverpool talisman Steven Gerrard scored with a 25-yard half volley 3 minutes from full-time. In the last game of Rivaldo's first season at Olympiacos, the club needed a victory in order to win the Alpha Ethniki championship, with Panathinaikos just one point behind. Olympiacos went on to beat Iraklis 0\u20131 in an away match in Thessaloniki, thanks to Rivaldo's goal, and secured the championship. Rivaldo renewed his contract with Olympiacos for a third year, despite now being 34 years old. In July 2006, Rivaldo announced that the 2006\u201307 season with Olympiacos would be his last in Europe, before returning to Brazil. However, he quickly changed his decision and decided to stay for another year. The 2006\u20132007 season saw him score 17 goals in 27 Superleague matches.

He was selected to represent Brazil at the 1996 Summer Olympics. The Brazilian team won the bronze medal, but Rivaldo was not selected for the third place playoff. Rivaldo returned to the Brazilian national team for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where he scored three goals en route to the final, including two in the 3\u20132 quarter-final win against Denmark. Brazil were defeated 3\u20130 by hosts France in final, failing to defend their 1994 title. Rivaldo had not been a part of the victorious Brazilian team at the 1997 Copa Am\u00e9rica tournament, but was part of the successful defence of that title at the 1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica. Rivaldo finished the tournament as the top scorer, with five goals; one being an equaliser from a free-kick in a 2\u20131 win over Argentina in the quarter-finals, and two in the 3\u20130 victory over Uruguay in the final. He was named the Most Valuable Player of the tournament. Rivaldo had been the centre of criticism when Brazil did not win tournaments, ever since the 1996 Olympics. In the 1\u20130 win against Colombia in November 2000, Rivaldo was booed so heavily that he threatened to retire from playing for his country. The zenith of Rivaldo's national team career came at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, hosted in South Korea and Japan, where he was able to erase the disappointment of the previous World Cup Final defeat, helping Brazil win their fifth World Cup. Featuring in an attacking trio with Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, dubbed \"the three R's\", Rivaldo scored in the first five games while Ronaldo scored in four matches. Despite a successful tournament, Rivaldo was involved in a controversial incident against Turkey. Near the end of the match, with the ball out of play, Turkish defender Hakan \u00dcnsal kicked a ball towards Rivaldo, who was waiting at the corner flag. The ball struck his thigh, but Rivaldo fell to the ground clutching his face. The referee sent the Turkish player off with a second yellow card. After a video review, Rivaldo was fined 11,670 Swiss francs by FIFA. Rivaldo's goal against Belgium in the second round prompted Belgian coach Robert Waseige to name him as the deciding factor. Ronaldinho assisted Rivaldo to score the equaliser against England in the quarter-finals before Ronaldinho scored the winning goal in a 2\u20131 victory. Brazil met Germany in the final, and went on to win the tournament with a 2\u20130 victory, courtesy of two goals by Ronaldo with Rivaldo involved in both goals. The first came after Rivaldo's shot was saved by German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn with Ronaldo scoring the rebound, and the second saw Rivaldo fool the German defence with a dummy as the ball ran on to Ronaldo who finished. Rivaldo was named by Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari as the best player of the tournament. Rivaldo along with Ronaldo and Ronaldinho were named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. Rivaldo's last cap was on 19 November 2003 in Curitiba in a 3\u20133 draw with Uruguay. He played 79 minutes before being substituted for Lu\u00eds Fabiano. He had scored his last goal just three days earlier from the penalty spot in a 1\u20131 draw with Peru. In his time with the national side, Rivaldo won 74 caps, and scored 35 goals."

        "content": "Regarded as one of the best players of his generation and also one of the greatest players of all time, Rivaldo was a critical, skillful, and creative player, known for his dribbling ability, use of feints, balance, and close ball control. Despite his height, he was also extremely agile. A dead-ball specialist, Rivaldo was renowned for his bending free kicks and penalty taking, as well as his ability to score from distance with powerful strikes. Left footed and possessing excellent technique, he was also known for his ball striking from volleys, and for having a penchant for scoring from bicycle kicks. Although he was not a true striker, Rivaldo was a prolific goalscorer, capable of playing in several creative and offensive positions: during the prime of his career, a period where he won the Ballon d'Or and was named FIFA World Player of the Year, he was often deployed in a playmaking attacking midfield role as a classic number 10, due to his vision and passing ability, which made him an excellent assist provider. He could also function as a second striker, or as a left winger, a position which he often occupied earlier in his career, due to his pace and crossing ability. Although predominantly left footed, he was capable of playing on either wing. In 2002, John Carlin of The Guardian noted that Rivaldo \"combines to dazzling effect the two essential qualities of the ideal footballer: artistry and efficiency.\" His colleague, Rob Smyth, echoed his views in 2008, commenting: \"if you could marry British will with continental skill, you would have the perfect footballer. Such a mixed recipe was thrillingly in evidence in Diego Maradona. Since then, however, perhaps only Rivaldo has fused the two qualities,\" noting that like the Argentinian, the Brazilian had \"bronca\" (the word used repeatedly in Diego Maradona's autobiography to refer to \"anger, fury, hatred, resentment, bitter discontent). He also argued that \"if you took everyone playing at the absolute peak of their game, Rivaldo was the best and most unstoppable footballer since Maradona.\" Former Dutch international Ruud Gullit believed that Rivaldo's ability and qualities were often overlooked, as \"he played in the same era as Brazilian counterparts Ronaldo and Ronaldinho.\""

The following year, he was a first round draft pick of the Dallas Texans. in the American Football League (AFL) Burford would catch 46 passes in his rookie season for the Texans, which went for 789 yards and five touchdowns. In 1961, he improved, catching 51 passes for 850 yards with five touchdowns to garner All-Star honors. In the 1962 season, he would play in just 11 games and missed out on the AFL title run, but he caught 45 passes for 645 yards for a league-high 12 touchdowns to garner All-Pro honors.  In 1963, he caught a career high 68 passes for 824 yards for nine touchdowns. In each of those seasons, he led the team in receptions.

        "content": "Pitching for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, he teamed with Sandy Koufax during the late 1950s to middle 1960s to form one of the most dominating pitching duos in history. Drysdale was a good hitting pitcher. In 14 seasons he had 218 hits in 1,169 at-bats for a .186 batting average, including 96 runs, 26 doubles, 7 triples, 29 home runs, 113 RBI and 60 bases on balls. Drysdale was occasionally used as a pinch-hitter, once during the World Series. Drysdale and fellow Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax served six months in the United States Army Reserve at Fort Dix in New Jersey after the end of the 1957 season and before spring training in 1958. In his book entitled Once a Bum, Always a Dodger, Drysdale wrote: \u201cThose six months were good for me. When you wake up at three-thirty every morning, and you realize that some of your buddies are just getting in back home, it gives you a lot of discipline. The service should be mandatory for every kid in America. You thought you were hot stuff being a major league pitcher, and then you went to Fort Dix and found out that it doesn\u2019t matter who you were. There were no exceptions.\u201d In 1962, Drysdale won 25 games and the Cy Young Award. In 1963, he struck out 251 batters and won Game 3 of the World Series at Los Angeles's Dodger Stadium over the Yankees, 1\u20130. In 1965 he was the Dodgers' only .300 hitter and tied his own National League record for pitchers with seven home runs. That year, he also won 23 games and helped the Dodgers to their third World Championship in Los Angeles. In 1968, Drysdale set Major League records with six consecutive shutouts and  consecutive scoreless innings. The latter record was broken by fellow Dodger Orel Hershiser 20 years later. Hershiser, however, did not match Drysdale's record of six consecutive complete-game shutouts. Drysdale ended his career with 209 wins, 2,486 strikeouts, 167 complete games and 49 shutouts. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984, and had his number 53 retired at Dodger Stadium on July 1, 1984. At the time of his retirement, Drysdale was the last remaining player on the Dodgers who had played for Brooklyn. He won three NL Player of the Month awards: June 1959 (6\u20130 record, 1.71 earned run average, 51 strikeouts), July 1960 (6\u20130 record, 2.00 earned run average, 48 strikeouts), and May 1968 (5\u20131 record, 0.53 earned run average, 45 strikeouts, with 5 consecutive shutouts to begin his scoreless inning streak, which was carried into June). In 1965, Sandy Koufax declined to pitch the first game of the World Series because it was on Yom Kippur, a Jewish holy day. Drysdale pitched for the Dodgers instead of Koufax, giving up seven runs in  innings. When Walter Alston, the manager, came to the mound to remove him from the game, Drysdale said, \"I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too.\" The Dodgers lost the game to the Minnesota Twins 8\u20132 but went on to win the Series 4 games to 3. Drysdale and Koufax took part in a famous salary holdout together in the spring of 1966. They had set an NL record the year before for strikeouts by teammates, with a combined total of 592. Both wanted to be paid $500,000 over three seasons, but Dodgers' GM Buzzie Bavasi preferred to give them one-year contracts according to team policy. They both finally signed one-year contracts just before the season opened. Dryasdale's was for $105,000, and Koufax's was for $130,000. Those contracts made them the first pitchers to earn more than $100,000 a year. After suffering a torn rotator cuff in 1969, Drysdale had to retire."

Veteran Sal Maglie, also known for brushback pitches, taught Drysdale how to pitch aggressively when both were Dodger teammates in the 1950s. Drysdale led the NL in hit batters for four straight seasons from 1958 to 1961. His 154 hit batsmen is a modern National League record. \"My own little rule was two for one,\" Drysdale said about his pitching. \"If one of my teammates got knocked down, then I knocked down two on the other team.\" Said Hall of Famer Frank Robinson, \"He was mean enough to do it, and he did it continuously. You could count on him doing it. And when he did it, he just stood there on the mound and glared at you to let you know he meant it.\" \"I don't think Don has ever tried intentionally to send someone to the hospital,\" said Maglie. \"A pitcher needs to pitch inside. And if one of your teammates goes down, you do what you have to do to even the score, plain and simple.\""

He also worked with his Angels' partner Dick Enberg on Los Angeles Rams football broadcasts from 1973\u20131976. Drysdale kept the fans' interest with stories of his playing days. While at ABC Sports, Drysdale not only did baseball telecasts, but also regional college football games as well as Superstars and Wide World of Sports. In 1979, Drysdale covered the World Series Trophy presentation ceremonies for ABC. On October 11, 1980, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma\u2013Texas college football game for ABC in the afternoon, then flew to Houston to call Game 4 of the NLCS between the Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies. In the meantime, Drysdale filled in for Jackson on play-by-play for the early innings. In 1984, Drysdale called play-by-play (alongside Reggie Jackson and Earl Weaver) for the National League Championship Series between the San Diego Padres and Chicago Cubs. On October 6, 1984, at San Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium, Game 4 of the NLCS ended when Padres first baseman Steve Garvey hit a two-run home run off of Lee Smith. Drysdale on the call: In his last ABC assignment, Drysdale interviewed the winners in the Boston Red Sox's clubhouse following Game 7 of the 1986 American League Championship Series against the California Angels. On August 14, 1983, while broadcasting for the White Sox, Drysdale generated some controversy while covering a heated argument between an umpire and Sox manager Tony La Russa. La Russa pulled up the third base bag and hurled it into the outfield, to the approval of the Comiskey Park crowd, and ensuring his ejection. Drysdale remarked, \"Go get 'em, Dago!\" For the Sox, Drysdale broadcast Tom Seaver's 300th victory, against the host New York Yankees in 1985. His post-game interview with Seaver was carried live by both the Sox' network and the Yankees' longtime flagship television station WPIX."

In his final start of the year, Hershiser needed to pitch 10 shutout innings to set the mark \u2013 meaning not only that he would have to prevent the San Diego Padres from scoring, but that his own team would also need to fail to score in order to ensure extra innings. The Dodgers' anemic offense obliged, and Hershiser pitched the first 10 innings of a scoreless tie, with the Padres eventually prevailing 2\u20131 in 16 innings. Hershiser almost did not pitch in the 10th inning, in deference to Drysdale, but was convinced to take the mound and try to break the record. When Hershiser broke Drysdale's record, Drysdale came onto the field to hug him, and said, \"Oh, I'll tell ya, congratulations... And at least you kept it in the family.\" Drysdale also called Kirk Gibson's walk-off home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series for the Dodgers Radio Network:"

Radio station employees were sent to look for him when he did not appear for the bus ride to Olympic Stadium, where the Dodgers were scheduled to play the Montreal Expos. Hotel staff entered his room and found him face-down near his bed. The coroner estimated that he had been dead for 18 hours. Drysdale's final broadcast was the night before his death. Drysdale's broadcasting colleague Vin Scully, who was instructed not to say anything on the air until Drysdale's family was notified, announced the news of his death by saying, \"Never have I been asked to make an announcement that hurts me as much as this one. And I say it to you as best I can with a broken heart.\" Fellow broadcaster Ross Porter told his radio audience, \"I just don't believe it, folks.\" While this was going on, word reached Drysdale's former White Sox colleague Ken Harrelson as he was calling that evening's game against the Baltimore Orioles and an emotional Harrelson had trouble relaying the news to the viewing audience. Dick Enberg, his broadcast partner with the Angels, said, \"Every day was a good day when you were with Don Drysdale.\" Drysdale was replaced by Rick Monday in the broadcast booth. Among the personal belongings found in Drysdale's hotel room was a cassette tape of Robert F. Kennedy's victory speech after the 1968 California Democratic presidential primary, a speech given only moments before Senator Kennedy's assassination. In the speech, Kennedy had noted, to the cheers of the crowd, that Drysdale had pitched his sixth straight shutout that evening. Drysdale had apparently carried the tape with him wherever he went since Kennedy's murder. Ronald Reagan was also a fan of Drysdale. Drysdale's body was cremated and his ashes were placed in the Utility Columbarium in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher in 1942 and then from 1946 until 1965, most notably for the Boston Braves, who became the Milwaukee Braves after the team moved west before the  season. His baseball career was interrupted by his military service in the United States Army during the Second World War. Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, Spahn attended South Park High School. With 363 victories over the span of his 21-year baseball playing career, Spahn holds the major league record for most career wins by a left-handed pitcher, and the most by a pitcher who played his entire career in the post-1920 live-ball era. He was a 17-time All-Star player who won 20\u00a0games or more in 13 seasons, including a 23\u20137 record when he was age 42. Spahn won the 1957 Cy Young Award and was a three-time runner-up during the period when only one award was given for both leagues. At the time of his retirement in 1965, Spahn held the Major League Baseball record for career strikeouts by a left-handed pitcher. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1973 with 82.89% of the vote. The Warren Spahn Award, given annually to the major leagues' best left-handed pitcher, is named in his honor. Regarded as a \"thinking man's\" pitcher who liked to outwit batters, Spahn once described his approach on the mound: \"Hitting is timing. Pitching is upsetting timing.\""

He finished his career in 1965 with the New York Mets and the San Francisco Giants. With 363 wins, Spahn is the sixth most winning pitcher in history, trailing only Cy Young (511), Walter Johnson (417), Grover Cleveland Alexander (373), Christy Mathewson (373), and Pud Galvin (364) on MLB's all-time list. He led the league in wins eight times (1949\u201350, 1953, 1957\u20131961, each season with 20+ wins) and won at least 20 games an additional five times (1947, 1951, 1954, 1956, 1963). Spahn also threw two no-hitters (in 1960 and 1961, at ages 39 and 40), won 3\u00a0ERA titles (1947, 1953, and 1961), and four strikeout crowns (1949\u20131952). He appeared in 14 All-Star Games, the most of any pitcher in the 20th century. He won the NL Player of the Month Award in August 1960 (6\u20130, 2.30 ERA, 32 SO) and August 1961 (6\u20130, 1.00 ERA, 26 SO) Spahn acquired the nickname \"Hooks\", not so much because of his pitching, but due to the prominent shape of his nose. He had once been hit in the face by a thrown ball that he was not expecting, and his broken nose settled into a hook-like shape. In Spahn's final season, during his stint with the Mets, Yogi Berra came out of retirement briefly and caught 4\u00a0games, one of them with Spahn pitching. Yogi later told reporters, \"I don't think we're the oldest battery, but we're certainly the ugliest.\" Spahn was known for a very high leg kick in his delivery, as was his later Giants teammate Juan Marichal. Photo sequences show that this high kick served a specific purpose. As a left-hander, Spahn was able not only to watch any runner on first base, but also to avoid telegraphing whether he was delivering to the plate or to first base, thereby forcing the runner to stay close to the bag. As his fastball waned, Spahn adapted, and relied more on location, changing speeds and a good screwball. He led or shared the lead in the NL in wins in 1957\u20131961 (age 36\u201340). Spahn was also a good hitter, hitting at least one home run in 17 straight seasons, and finishing with an NL career record for pitchers, with 35 home runs. Wes Ferrell, who spent most of his time in the American League, holds the overall record for pitchers, with 37. Spahn posted a .194 batting average (363-for-1872) with 141 runs, 57 doubles, 6 triples, 94 bases on balls and 189 RBI. He also drove in 10 or more runs nine times, with a career-high 18 in 1951. In 1958 he batted a strong .333 (36-for-108). In eight World Series games, he batted .200 (4-for-20) with 4 RBI and 1 walk."

Spahn took the loss against the Batavia Clippers pitching out of the bullpen where he walked two batters and struck out none.  He finished the season with a 5\u20134 record and 2.73 ERA.

Spahn had pitched in only 4 games, allowing 15 runs (10 earned) in \u00a0innings. Stengel later said that it was the worst managing mistake he had ever made: I said \"no guts\" to a kid who went on to become a war hero and one of the greatest lefthanded pitchers you ever saw. You can't say I don't miss 'em when I miss 'em. The 1942 Braves finished next to last, and Stengel was fired the following year. Spahn was reunited with his first manager 23 years later, for the even more woeful last-place New York Mets, and\u2014referring to Stengel's success with the 1949\u201360 New York Yankees\u2014later quipped, \"I'm probably the only guy who played for Casey before and after he was a genius.\" Spahn finished the 1942 season with a 17\u201312 record for the Hartford Bees of the Class-A Eastern League"

He served with distinction, and was awarded a Purple Heart. He saw action in the Battle of the Bulge and at the Ludendorff Bridge as a combat engineer, and was awarded a battlefield commission. Spahn returned to the major leagues in 1946 at the age of 25, having missed three full seasons. Had he played, it is possible that Spahn would have finished his career behind only Walter Johnson and Cy Young in all-time wins. Spahn was unsure of the war's impact on his career: People say that my absence from the big leagues may have cost me a chance to win 400 games. But I don't know about that. I matured a lot in three years, and I think I was better equipped to handle major league hitters at 25 than I was at 22. Also, I pitched until I was 44. Maybe I wouldn't have been able to do that otherwise."

Spahn also won two more ERA titles, in 1953 and 1961.

In 1951, Spahn allowed the first career hit to Willie Mays, a home run. Mays had begun his career 0-for-12, and Spahn responded to reporters after the game, citing the distance between home plate and the pitcher's mound of , \"Gentlemen, for the first 60 feet, that was a hell of a pitch.\" Spahn joked a long time later, \"I'll never forgive myself. We might have gotten rid of Willie forever if I'd only struck him out.\" (In 1962, another Hall of Famer hit his first career home run off Spahn: Sandy Koufax, who only hit one other.) According to former Cardinals player Solly Hemus, Spahn, along with teammate Lew Burdette, periodically used anti-Semitic slurs while on the mound."

        "content": "In 1957, Spahn was the ace of the champion Milwaukee Braves. Spahn pitched on two other Braves pennant winners, in 1948 and 1958. Spahn led the NL in strikeouts for four consecutive seasons, from 1949 to 1952 (tied with Don Newcombe in 1951), which includes a single game high of 18 strike outs (then the NL record) in a 15-inning appearance on June 14, 1952. During the 1957 World Series, Sal Maglie of the Yankees, ineligible to pitch in the series because he was acquired too late in the season, watched the games with Robert Creamer of Sports Illustrated and made assessments of the players. When Spahn was pitching, Maglie observed that batters had to try to hit balls to the opposite field against Spahn, as he was more likely to get them out if they tried to pull the ball. Spahn maintained that \"A pitcher needs two pitches\u00a0\u2014 one they're looking for, and one to cross 'em up.\" He was thus able to maintain his position as one of the game's top pitchers until his 19th season in the sport. This was exemplified by his start on July 2, 1963. Facing the San Francisco Giants, the 42-year-old Spahn became locked into a storied pitchers' duel with 25-year-old Juan Marichal. The score was still 0\u20130 after more than four hours when Willie Mays hit a game-winning solo home run off Spahn with one out in the bottom of the 16th inning. Marichal's manager, Alvin Dark, visited the mound in the 9th, 10th, 11th, 13th, and 14th innings, and was talked out of removing Marichal each time. During the 14th-inning visit, Marichal told Dark, \"Do you see that man pitching for the other side? Do you know that man is 42 years old? I'm only 25. If that man is on the mound, nobody is going to take me out of here.\" Marichal ended up throwing 227 pitches in the complete game 1\u20130 win, while Spahn threw 201 in the loss, allowing nine hits and one walk. Hall of Famer Carl Hubbell, who was in attendance that night, said of Spahn, \"He ought to will his body to medical science.\" Spahn threw his first no-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies on September 16, 1960, when he was 39. He pitched his second no-hitter the following year on April 28, 1961, against the Giants. By the last two seasons of his career, Spahn was the oldest active player in baseball. He lost this distinction for a single day: September 25, 1965, when 58-year-old Satchel Paige pitched three innings. Spahn's seemingly ageless ability caused Stan Musial to quip, \"[Spahn] will never get into the Hall of Fame. He won't stop pitching.\""

Spahn won four and lost 12 at which point the Mets put Spahn on waivers. He was put on waivers on July 15, 1965, and released on July 22, 1965.

        "content": "Griffin began his career as a member of the Cleveland Indians, who signed him as an amateur free agent in 1973. On December 5, 1978, before having played a full season in the majors, he was traded, along with Phil Lansford (minors), to the Toronto Blue Jays for V\u00edctor Cruz. Griffin made an immediate impact, sharing the American League Rookie of the Year Award in 1979 with John Castino. In 1980, Griffin led the majors in triples, tying Willie Wilson of the Kansas City Royals with 15; both Griffin and Wilson set an AL record for most triples in a single season by a switch-hitter. Five years later in 1985, Wilson himself shattered the record that he shared with Griffin by tallying 21 triples. In 1984, Griffin was named to the All-Star team.  This was explained by John Feinstein of The Washington Post as: \"Making the All-Star team the hard way: Major league baseball pays the expenses for each player here and for one guest. In most cases, players bring wives or girlfriends. D\u00e1maso Garc\u00eda, the Toronto Blue Jays' second baseman, brought his shortstop, Alfredo Griffin. When the Tigers' Alan Trammell hurt his arm and could not play tonight, Manager Joe Altobelli named Griffin to the team, partly because he's a fine player, but mostly because he was here.\" Griffin spent six years with the Blue Jays from 1979 to 1984, playing in 392 consecutive games. He was traded after the 1984 season to the Oakland Athletics, where, despite his reluctance to draw walks and a tendency to be overaggressive on the basepaths, he began to harness the offensive promise that he showed in 1980. Griffin won the American League Gold Glove Award in 1985. After establishing personal bests in most offensive categories with the Athletics, Griffin was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Bob Welch prior to the 1988 season. The three-team trade, which included the New York Mets, also netted the Dodgers Jay Howell and Jesse Orosco. All three teams involved in the deal would go on to win their respective divisions in 1988. A Dwight Gooden fastball broke Griffin's hand in May 1988, and Griffin was disabled for much of 1988 and part of 1989. He missed most of the 1988 season, but the Dodgers won the World Series, and he was awarded a championship ring. In 1990, Griffin became the last player to finish last in the National League, of those who qualified for the batting title, in batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage. Griffin returned to Toronto in 1992 and was a bench player as the Blue Jays won the first of two consecutive championships. On October 23, 1993, he stood on deck as Joe Carter faced Mitch Williams in the ninth inning of Game Six. His career came to an end moments later when Carter homered to win the World Series for Toronto. Griffin was the first player in major league history to have started three times for the opposing line-ups in a perfect game: against Len Barker (Cleveland) in 1981 for the Toronto Blue Jays, then against Tom Browning (Cincinnati) in 1988 and Dennis Mart\u00ednez (Montreal) in 1991, both for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Griffin ended his 18-year playing career with a .249 batting average, 24 home runs, 527 runs batted in, and a 67 OPS+ in 1,962 games played. Writer Bill James named Griffin the most aggressive baserunner of the 1980s."

His older sister Silke Nowitzki, a local champion in track and field, also became a basketball player and now works for the NBA in International TV. Nowitzki was a very tall child; most of the time he stood above his peers by a foot or more. He initially played handball and tennis. He managed to become a ranked junior tennis player in the German youth circuit, but soon grew tired of being called a \"freak\" for his height and eventually turned to basketball. After joining the local DJK W\u00fcrzburg, the 15-year-old attracted the attention of former German international basketball player Holger Geschwindner, who spotted his talent immediately and offered to coach him individually two to three times per week. After getting both the approval of Nowitzki and his parents, Geschwindner put his student through an unorthodox training scheme: he emphasized shooting and passing exercises, and shunned weight training and tactical drills, because he felt it was \"unnecessary friction\". Furthermore, Geschwindner encouraged Nowitzki to play a musical instrument and read literature to make him a more complete personality. After a year, the coach was so impressed with Nowitzki's progress that he advised him, \"You must now decide whether you want to play against the best in the world or just stay a local hero in Germany. If you choose the latter, we will stop training immediately, because nobody can prevent that anymore. But if you want to play against the best, we have to train on a daily basis.\" After pondering this lifetime decision for two days, Nowitzki agreed to enter the full-time training schedule, choosing the path to his eventual international career. Geschwindner let him train seven days a week with DJK W\u00fcrzburg players and future German internationals Robert Garrett, Marvin Willoughby, and Demond Greene, and in the summer of 1994, then 16-year-old Nowitzki made the DJK squad."

His first trainer was Pit Stahl, who played the tall teenager as an outside-scoring forward rather than an inside-scoring center to utilise his shooting skills. In the 1994\u201395 Second Bundesliga season, ambitious DJK finished as a disappointing sixth of 12 teams; the rookie Nowitzki was often benched and struggled with bad school grades, which forced him to study rather than work on his game. In the next 1995\u201396 Second Bundesliga season, Nowitzki established himself as a starter next to Finnish star forward Martti Kuisma and soon became a regular double-digit scorer: after German national basketball coach Dirk Bauermann saw him score 24 points in a DJK game, he stated that \"Dirk Nowitzki is the greatest German basketball talent of the last 10, maybe 15 years.\" In the 1996\u201397 Second Bundesliga season, Nowitzki averaged 19.4 points per game and led DJK again to second place after the regular season, but could not help his team gain promotion. In the following 1997\u201398 Second Bundesliga season, Nowitzki finished his \"Abitur\" (German A-levels), but had to do compulsory military service in the Bundeswehr which lasted from September 1, 1997, to June 30, 1998; The 18-year-old, who had grown to  tall, made progress, leading DJK to a 36:4-point total (in Germany, a victory gives 2:0 points and a loss 0:2) and ending as leading scorer with 28.2 points per game. In the promotion playoffs, DJK finally broke its hex, finishing at first place with 14:2 points and earning promotion to the next higher league; Nowitzki was voted \"German Basketballer of the Year\" by the German BASKET magazine. Abroad, Nowitzki's progress was noticed. A year later, the teenager participated in the Nike \"Hoop Heroes Tour\", where he played against NBA stars like Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen. In a 30-minute show match, Nowitzki outplayed Barkley and even dunked on him, causing the latter to exclaim: \"The boy is a genius. If he wants to enter the NBA, he can call me.\" On March 29, 1998, Nowitzki was chosen to play in the Nike Hoop Summit, one of the premier talent watches in U.S. men's basketball. In a match between the U.S. talents and the international talents, Nowitzki scored 33 points on 6-of-12 shooting, 14 rebounds and 3 steals for the internationals and outplayed future US NBA players Rashard Lewis and Al Harrington. He impressed with a combination of quickness, ball handling, and shooting range, and from that moment a multitude of European and NBA clubs wanted to recruit him."

The Milwaukee Bucks selected Nowitzki with the ninth pick in the draft and traded him to the Dallas Mavericks in a multi-team deal; future star point guard Steve Nash came to Dallas in the same trade. Nowitzki and Nash quickly became close friends. Nowitzki became only the fourth German player in NBA history, following pivots Uwe Blab and Christian Welp and All-Star swingman Detlef Schrempf, who was a 35-year-old veteran of the Seattle SuperSonics when his young compatriot arrived. Nowitzki finished his DJK career as the only W\u00fcrzburg player to have ever made the NBA. In Dallas, Nowitzki joined a franchise which had last made the playoffs in 1990. Shooting guard Michael Finley captained the squad, supported by  center Shawn Bradley (once a number two draft pick) and team scoring leader Cedric Ceballos, an ex-Laker forward. The start of the season was delayed by the 1998\u201399 NBA lockout, which put the entire season in jeopardy. In limbo, Nowitzki returned to DJK W\u00fcrzburg and played thirteen games before both sides worked out a late compromise deal that resulted in a shortened NBA schedule of only 50 games. When the season finally started, Nowitzki struggled. Played as a power forward by coach Don Nelson, the 20-year-old felt overpowered by the more athletic NBA forwards, was intimidated by the expectations as a number nine pick, and played bad defense; hecklers taunted him as \"Irk Nowitzki\", omitting the \"D\" which stands for \"defense\" in basketball slang. He only averaged 8.2 points and 3.4 rebounds in 20.4 minutes of playing time. Looking back, Nowitzki said: \"I was so frustrated I even contemplated going back to Germany.... [the jump from Second Bundesliga to the NBA] was like jumping out of an airplane hoping the parachute would somehow open.\" The Mavericks only won 19 of their 50 games and missed the playoffs."

Nowitzki averaged 17.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game in 35.8 minutes.

As a sign of his growing importance, he joined team captain Finley as only one of two Mavericks to play and start in all 82 games, and had 10 games in which he scored at least 30 points. Nowitzki became the first Maverick ever to be voted into the All-NBA squads, making the Third Team. In addition, his best friend Nash became a valuable point guard, and with Finley scoring more than ever, pundits took to calling this trio the \"Big Three\" of the Mavericks. Posting a 53\u201329 record in the regular season, the Mavericks reached the playoffs for the first time since 1990. As the fifth seed, they were paired against the Utah Jazz, who were led by point guard John Stockton and power forward Karl Malone. The Mavericks won the series in five games, setting up a meeting with their Texas rivals, the San Antonio Spurs. The Mavericks lost the first three games of the series, and Nowitzki fell ill with the flu and later lost a tooth after a collision with Spurs guard Terry Porter. After a Game 4 win, Nowitzki scored 42 points and grabbed 18 rebounds in Game 5, but could not prevent a deciding 105\u201387 loss."

He continued to improve, averaging 23.4 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. Nowitzki was voted into the All-NBA Second Team and into his first All-Star Game. After making the playoffs with a 57\u201325 record, the Mavericks swept Kevin Garnett and the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round; Nowitzki averaged 33.3 points per game. In the second round, the Mavericks met the Sacramento Kings and rival power forward Chris Webber. After splitting the first two games, Kings coach Rick Adelman changed his defensive scheme, assigning Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu to cover Nowitzki. T\u00fcrko\u011flu would use his agility to play Nowitzki tightly, and if the taller Maverick tried to post up T\u00fcrko\u011flu, Webber would double team Nowitzki. In Game 3 in Dallas, the Mavericks lost, 125\u2013119; Nowitzki scored only 19 points and said: \"I simply could not pass T\u00fcrko\u011flu, and if I did, I ran into a double team and committed too many turnovers.\" In Game 4, Nowitzki missed two potentially game-deciding jump shots, and the Mavericks lost, 115\u2013113, at home. In Game 5, the Mavericks were eliminated, 114\u2013101. However, Nowitzki received a consolation award: the Gazzetta dello Sport voted him as \"European Basketballer of the Year\", his 104 votes lifting him over second-placed Dejan Bodiroga (54) and Stojakovic (50)."

In that season, Nowitzki lifted his averages again, now scoring 25.1 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game.

Now playing in a best-of-seven series instead of the former best-of-five, the Mavericks quickly won the first three games, but then completely lost their rhythm and the next three. In Game 7, Nowitzki hit a clutch three to make it 100\u201394 with 1:21 left and the Mavericks won 107\u201395. \"This was the most important basket of my career\", he later said, \"I was not prepared to go on vacation that early.\" In the next round, the Mavericks met the Kings again, and the series went seven games.

In his team's final home game of the season, a 120\u2013109 victory over the Phoenix Suns on April 9, Nowitzki scored 30 points, and announced his retirement in an emotional ceremony during which Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Shawn Kemp, Scottie Pippen, and Detlef Schrempf appeared on the court to give laudatory speeches for Nowitzki. One day later, he played his final NBA game, recording a double-double with 20 points and 10 rebounds in a 105\u201394 loss to the Spurs."

        "content": "Nowitzki began playing for the German national basketball team in 1997. In his debut tournament, the EuroBasket 1999, the 21-year-old rookie emerged as the main German scorer, but Germany finished seventh and failed to qualify for the 2000 Olympic Games. In the EuroBasket 2001, Nowitzki was top scorer with 28.7 points per game, and narrowly lost the MVP vote to Serbian player Peja Stojakovi\u0107. Germany reached the semi-finals and were close to beating host nation Turkey, but Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu hit a three-point buzzer beater to tie it, and the Turks eventually won in overtime. Germany then lost, 99\u201390, against Spain, and did not win a medal. However, with averages of 28.7 points and 9.1 rebounds, Nowitzki led the tournament in both statistics, and was voted to the All-Star team. Back home, the German basketball team attracted up to 3.7\u00a0million television viewers, a German basketball record at the time. Nowitzki earned his first medal when he led Germany to a bronze medal in the 2002 FIBA World Championship. In the quarter-finals against the Pau Gasol-led Spain, Spain was up 52\u201346 after three-quarters, but then Nowitzki scored 10 points in the last quarter and led Germany to a 70\u201362 win. In the semi-finals, his team played against the Argentinian team led by Manu Gin\u00f3bili, but despite leading, 74\u201369, four minutes from the end and despite Argentina losing Ginobili to a foot injury, the South Americans won, 86\u201380. However, the Germans won 117\u201394 against New Zealand in the consolation finals and won bronze, and Nowitzki, as the tournament's top scorer, (24.0 points per game), was elected the tournament MVP. Back in Germany, over four million television viewers followed the games, an all-time record in German basketball history. In a preparation game for EuroBasket 2003, Nowitzki suffered a foot injury after a collision with French player Florent Pi\u00e9trus; as a result, Nowitzki played inconsistently and was also often target of hard fouls. In the decisive second-round match against Italy (only the winner was allowed to play the medal round), Germany lost, 86\u201384, finished ninth and did not qualify for the 2004 Olympic Games. Nowitzki scored 22.5 points per game (third overall), but in general seemed to lack focus and dominance due to his injury. In the EuroBasket 2005, Nowitzki led a depleted German squad into the Finals, beating title favorites Slovenia in the quarter-finals and Spain in the semi-finals on the way. EuroBasket pundits praised Nowitzki in both matches: against Slovenia (76\u201362), the forward scored a game-high 22 points and commented: \"The Slovenians underestimated us. They said we were the team they wanted and that was wrong, you shouldn't do that in the quarter-finals.\" Against Spain (74\u201373), Nowitzki scored a game-high 27 points and scored the decisive basket: down by one and with only a few seconds to go, he drove on Spanish forward Jorge Garbajosa, and hit a baseline jump shot over Garbajosa's outstretched arms with 3.9 seconds to go. The German later commented: \"It was indescribable. Garbajosa kind of pushed me towards the baseline so I just went with it.\" Despite losing the Finals, 78\u201362, to the Greeks, Nowitzki was the tournament's leading scorer (26.1 per game), and second-leading rebounder (10.6 per game), and shot blocker (1.9 per game), and he was also voted the Most Valuable Player of the tournament. When he was subbed out towards the end of the final, Nowitzki received a standing ovation from the crowd, which he later recalled as \"one of the best moments of [his] career\". The German team was awarded a silver medal. In the 2006 FIBA World Championship, Nowitzki led the German team to an eighth place and commented: \"It's tough luck. But overall, finishing eighth in the world is not bad.\" In the EuroBasket 2007, in which the top three teams automatically qualified for the 2008 Olympics, Nowitzki led Germany to a fifth place. He was the leading scorer with 24.0 points per game. The fifth place meant that Germany fell short of direct qualification, but was allowed to participate in the 2008 Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Nowitzki led Germany into a decisive match against Puerto Rico for the last remaining slot. In that crucial match, he scored a game-high 32 points and was vital for the 96\u201382 win which sent the German basketball team to their first Olympics since the 1992 Summer Olympics. Nowitzki was chosen to be the flag bearer for the German Olympic Team at the Opening Ceremony for the 2008 Olympics. Nowitzki led the German team to a tenth-place finish, and averaged 17.0 points and 8.4 rebounds for the tournament. In 2009, Nowitzki skipped the EuroBasket 2009. In July 2010, he said that he would skip the 2010 FIBA World Championship. In summer 2011, Nowitzki played with Germany in the EuroBasket 2011, where the team reached ninth place. In 2015, Nowitzki captained Germany at the EuroBasket. They won only one game, and were eliminated in the group stage, on home soil. In January 2016, Nowitzki officially announced his retirement from Germany's national team. In his career with Germany's senior men's national team, he averaged 19.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 1.6 assists per game. Nowitzki was named the Euroscar European Basketball Player of the Year by the Italian sports newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport for five years running from 2002 to 2006 and again in 2011. He was also named the Mister Europa European Player of the Year by the Italian sports magazine Superbasket in 2005, and the FIBA Europe Men's Player of the Year twice in 2005 and 2011."

        "content": "Nowitzki was a versatile frontcourt player who mostly played the power forward, but also played center and small forward in his career. An exceptional shooter for his size, Nowitzki made 88% of his free throws, nearly 50% of his field goal attempts and nearly 40% of his 3-point shots, and won the 2006 NBA All-Star Three-Point Contest. In the 2006\u201307 season, Nowitzki became only the fifth member of the NBA's 50\u201340\u201390 Club for players who shot 50% or better from the field, 40% or better on three-pointers, and 90% or better on free-throws in a single season while achieving the NBA league minimum number of makes in each category. Nowitzki's shooting accuracy, combined with his long seven-foot frame and unique shooting mechanics (such as having a release point above his head), made his jump shots difficult to contest. Before the start of the 2011 NBA Finals, LeBron James called Nowitzki's one-legged fadeaway the second most unstoppable move ever, behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook. Additionally, Nowitzki could drive to the basket from the perimeter like few men his size were able to do. NBA.com lauded his versatility by stating: \"The 7\u20130 forward who at times mans the pivot can strike fear in an opponent when he corrals a rebound and leads the break or prepares to launch a three-point bomb.\" Charles Barkley said the best way to guard Nowitzki was to \"get a cigarette and a blindfold\". Later on in his career, Nowitzki also developed an unorthodox post-up game, often backing down his opponents from the free-throw line or near the middle of the key, opening up the floor for multiple passing angles should a double team come his way. Nowitzki was the sixth player in NBA history, and the first European, to hit the 30,000-point milestone. Apart from being the Mavericks' all-time leader in points, rebounds, field goals, field goal attempts, 3-pointers, 3-point attempts, blocks, free throws, and free-throw attempts, Nowitzki made the NBA All-Star games fourteen times and the All-NBA Teams twelve times. He was voted NBA MVP of the 2006\u201307 NBA season, becoming the first European player to receive the honor, as well as the MVP of the 2011 NBA Finals. Other achievements include winning the 2006 Three-Point Contest and the 2017 NBA Teammate of the Year award, being voted European Basketballer of the Year five times in a row by La Gazzetta dello Sport. He was the leading scorer and MVP of the 2002 FIBA World Championship, and EuroBasket 2005 tournaments. Nowitzki is the only player to record at least 31,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, 3,000 assists, 1,000 steals, 1,000 blocks and 1,000 three-point field goals."

Nowitzki passed his Abitur examination at R\u00f6ntgen Gymnasium Grammar School of W\u00fcrzburg. He founded the Dirk Nowitzki Foundation, a charity which aims at fighting poverty in Africa. Nowitzki dated Sybille Gerer, a female basketball player from his local club DJK W\u00fcrzburg. The relationship started in 1992 and lasted for 10 years before it ended in 2002; Nowitzki said, \"At the end, we found out we developed in separate ways.... It did not work anymore, but we are still good friends.\" He added: \"I surely want to start a family and have kids, but I cannot imagine it happening before I become 30.\" In 2010, Nowitzki met and began dating Jessica Olsson, sister of twin Swedish footballers Martin Olsson and Marcus Olsson. The couple got married on July 20, 2012, at Nowitzki's home in Dallas. They have a daughter, born in July 2013 and two sons, born in March 2015 and November 2016. Though Nowitzki has considered acquiring U.S. citizenship, he remains a German national. Nowitzki acknowledged close ties to his mentor Holger Geschwindner, whom he called his best friend. He is also good friends with his ex-teammate Steve Nash. Nash said of playing with Nowitzki, \"We were both joining a new club, living in a new city, we were both single and outsiders: this creates a bond... He made life easier for me and I for him... Our friendship was something solid in a very volatile world.\" Nowitzki added, \"He would have also become a good friend if we had met at the supermarket.\" Nowitzki is a keen association football fan and an avid supporter of Arsenal F.C."

        "content": "Roberto Luongo (, , ; born April 4, 1979) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played 19 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Islanders, Florida Panthers and the Vancouver Canucks. Luongo is a two-time NHL Second Team All-Star (2004 and 2007) and a winner of the William M. Jennings Trophy for backstopping his team to the lowest goals against average in the league (2011, with backup Cory Schneider). He was a finalist for several awards, including the Vezina Trophy as the league's best goaltender (2004, 2007 and 2011), the Lester B. Pearson Award as the top player voted by his peers (2004 and 2007), and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player (2007). Luongo is second all time in games played as an NHL goaltender (1,044) and fourth all time in wins (489). He employed the butterfly style of goaltending. Born in Montreal, Quebec, Luongo is of Italian and Irish ancestry. Prior to his NHL career, he played in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for the Val-d'Or Foreurs and the Acadie-Bathurst Titan, winning back-to-back President's Cups and establishing the league's all-time play-off records in games played and wins. Following his second QMJHL season, Luongo was selected fourth overall by the Islanders in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. After splitting his professional rookie season between the Islanders and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Lowell Lock Monsters in 1999\u20132000, he was traded to the Panthers. In five seasons with Florida, Luongo established team records for most games played, wins and shutouts; despite several strong seasons, however, the Panthers remained a weak team and were unable to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs during Luongo's initial stint with the team. During the 2006 off-season, he was traded to the Canucks after failed contract negotiations with the Panthers. In his first season in Vancouver, Luongo won 47 games, and was runner-up in voting for both the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP) and Vezina Trophy (best goaltender). Following his second year with the Canucks, he became the first NHL goaltender to serve as a team captain since Bill Durnan in the 1947\u201348 season. Luongo served in that capacity for two seasons before resigning from the position in September 2010. In the subsequent 2010\u201311 season, he helped the Canucks to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals but lost to the Boston Bruins. During his eight-year tenure with Vancouver, Luongo became the team's all-time leader in wins and shutouts. He returned to the Panthers during the 2013\u201314 season, where he spent the remainder of his career, qualifying for the playoffs with the Panthers only once during that time. Internationally, Luongo has competed for Team Canada in numerous tournaments. As a junior, he won a silver medal at the 1999 World Junior Championships, while being named Best Goaltender in his second tournament appearance. Luongo won two gold medals at the 2003 and 2004 World Championships and a silver in the 2005 World Championships. He also won the 2004 World Cup championship and appeared in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin as a backup to Martin Brodeur in both instances. He succeeded Brodeur as Canada's starting goaltender during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, winning a gold medal. On January 7, 2014, he was named to the 2014 Canadian Olympic hockey team, where he won his second Olympic gold medal in a largely backup role to Carey Price."

        "title": "Roberto Luongo_Early life",
        "content": "Luongo was born to Pasqualina and Antonio Luongo in Montreal, Quebec. His father is an Italian immigrant, born in Santa Paolina, Avellino. He worked in the construction and delivery of furniture, while Luongo's mother, an Irish-Canadian, worked in marketing with Air Canada. Antonio and Pasqualina married in Montreal after Antonio emigrated there in 1976. Luongo has two younger brothers, Leo and Fabio, who also aspired to be goaltenders. Fabio progressed the further of the two, playing Junior A in the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL) with the Williams Lake Timberwolves in 2004\u201305 before injuries ended his career. He has since become a Junior AAA coach, while Leo is a goaltending coach with HC Lugano. Luongo and his family lived in Saint-Leonard, Quebec, a borough north of Montreal with a strong Italian community, just four blocks away from Martin Brodeur, who became the goaltender for the New Jersey Devils six years before Luongo entered the NHL. Luongo is fluent in English, French and Italian. His father spoke Italian and his mother spoke English with a little French at home. Luongo graduated from Montreal Francophone high school Antoine de St-Exup\u00e9ry in 1996. He began playing organized hockey at the age of eight as a forward. His father taught all his sons soccer and Luongo played until he was 14, at which point he decided to concentrate on hockey. Although he initially had the desire to play in net, his parents wanted him to develop his skating first. Several years later, after Luongo was cut from a peewee team, he made the switch to goaltender. At 11 years old, his team's usual goaltender did not show up and after begging his mother, still hesitant about Luongo playing the position, he went in net and posted a shutout. In August 2009, the arena in which Luongo played his minor hockey in St. Leonard was named after him as the Roberto Luongo Arena. It is the second arena in the community to be named after an NHL goalie after the Martin Brodeur Arena was renamed as such in 2000. By 15, Luongo was playing midget with Montreal-Bourassa, the same team that produced NHL Quebecer goalies Brodeur and F\u00e9lix Potvin. Luongo has credited Hall of Fame goaltender Grant Fuhr as his inspiration growing up, citing an admiration for his \"spectacular glove saves\". He had the opportunity to first meet Fuhr before a game against the Calgary Flames during his rookie season with the Islanders."

        "content": "The Val-d'Or Foreurs made Luongo the highest-drafted goaltender in QMJHL history, at second overall, in 1995. He began his junior career in the 1995\u201396 season with Val-d'Or and posted six wins in 23 games played. As the team's starting goaltender the following season in 1996\u201397, he improved to a team-record 32 wins, and was awarded the Mike Bossy Trophy as the league's best professional prospect. After his performance at the 1997 CHL Top Prospects Game, opposing coach Don Cherry likened Luongo to Montreal Canadiens' Hockey Hall of Famer Ken Dryden, while NHL Central Scouting Bureau director Frank Bonello heralded him as a \"franchise goalie\". At the 1997 NHL Entry Draft, Luongo was selected in the first round, fourth overall, by the New York Islanders. The pick originally belonged to the Toronto Maple Leafs but was traded to the Islanders in exchange for Wendel Clark, Mathieu Schneider and D. J. Smith. At the time of the draft, Luongo was the highest-picked goaltender in NHL history, surpassing Tom Barrasso, John Davidson, and Ray Martynuik's fifth overall selections in 1983, 1973, and 1970 (Luongo's selection was later surpassed by Rick DiPietro's first overall selection by the Islanders in 2000). Upon his draft, Luongo continued to play junior with the Foreurs in 1997\u201398. He recorded 27 wins and a 3.09 goals against average (GAA). His seven shutouts tied Nick Sanza's QMJHL record, set in 1974\u201375 (Adam Russo later tied it as well in 2002\u201303). Although the Islanders planned to have Luongo play in the NHL for the 1998\u201399 season, an inconsistent performance at training camp led to Luongo's return to the QMJHL that season. Owing to having failed to come to terms on a contract before October 1, 1998, Luongo was not allowed to be called up to the Islanders from junior over the course of the subsequent season. He started the season with Val-d'Or but was traded to the Acadie-Bathurst Titan during the 1999 World Junior Championships for the remainder of the 1998\u201399 season. He went on to lead the Titan to his second consecutive President's Cup championship with a 2.74 GAA in 23 games. He finished his QMJHL playoff career with the all-time league record in games played (56), minutes played (3,264:22), wins (38) and shots faced (1,808)."

        "content": "After his performance at the 1999 World Junior Championships, Luongo was signed by the Islanders to a three-year, $2.775\u00a0million contract on January 8, 1999. The following season, he made his professional debut with the Lowell Lock Monsters, the Islanders' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate. Early in the season, Luongo was called up to the Islanders on November 22, 1999, after a shoulder injury to backup Wade Flaherty. He made his NHL debut six days later on November 28, stopping 43 shots in a 2\u20131 win against the Boston Bruins. Luongo's early performances solidified him as the Islanders' starting goalie over veteran F\u00e9lix Potvin. Nearly a month after Luongo's debut in New York, Potvin was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on December 19 in exchange for backup goaltender Kevin Weekes. The next month, he recorded his first career NHL shutout in his eighth game, stopping 34 shots in a 3\u20130 victory over the Bruins on December 27. In January 2000, Luongo was publicly criticized by Islanders general manager Mike Milbury for having gone looking for an apartment in New York on a game day before letting in seven goals to the Boston Bruins. Milbury told the media, \"You can't do that in the NHL. You have to prepare yourself.\" Luongo defended himself by saying he did not divert from his usual game day routine by looking at just one apartment. In the off-season, the Islanders selected goaltender Rick DiPietro with the first overall pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. DiPietro's selection supplanted Luongo as the highest-drafted goaltender in NHL history and the Islanders' goaltender of the future. Consequently, Milbury traded Luongo to the Florida Panthers along with centre Olli Jokinen for winger Mark Parrish and centre Oleg Kvasha that same day on June 24, 2000. The deal would later be seen to have disproportionately benefited the Panthers, as both Jokinen and Luongo would eventually develop into star players, in contrast to Parrish and Kvasha. Later in his career, Luongo expressed surprise at the trade, saying that before the Islanders drafted DiPietro, he had believed the team was preparing to make him its starting goaltender for the upcoming season."

        "content": "The Panthers' organization expressed high praise for Luongo following the trade. General manager Bryan Murray characterized him as \"a franchise guy\", while head coach Terry Murray added \"He's the guy teams have to have to win the Stanley Cup.\" He entered his first training camp with the Panthers competing for the starting role with veteran goaltender Trevor Kidd; coach Terry Murray opted to begin the season with Kidd owing to his experience. Luongo made his first start with the Panthers on October 9, 2000, making 18 saves in a 4\u20132 loss to the Boston Bruins. When splitting the goaltending duties, Luongo went on to appear in 43 games, in comparison to Kidd's 42. He finished his 2000\u201301 rookie season (Luongo qualified as a rookie because he had not played in at least 26 games the previous season with New York) by notching a franchise record fifth shutout of the season in a 3\u20130 win against the New York Rangers on April 7, 2001. The total surpassed John Vanbiesbrouck's four-shutout mark, set in both the 1994\u201395 and 1997\u201398 seasons. He posted a 12\u201324\u20137 record with the struggling Panthers, who finished 12th in the Eastern Conference, while recording a 2.44 GAA. His .920 save percentage was sixth in the league and second all-time among rookie goaltenders, behind Manny Fernandez's mark set the previous season. Approaching his third NHL season, Luongo agreed on a four-year contract extension with the Panthers on September 13, 2001. He was chosen to play in the inaugural NHL YoungStars Game in 2002 for Team Melrose, winning 13\u20137 over Team Fox. After appearing in 58 games in 2001\u201302, Luongo suffered a torn ligament in his right ankle in a game against the Montreal Canadiens on March 20, 2002. Sidelined for the remainder of the season, he finished with a 16\u201333\u20134 record, a 2.77 GAA and .915 save percentage. Luongo returned in 2002\u201303 to a heavier workload, playing a 65-game season. He had a franchise record-setting shutout streak that lasted 144:51 minutes; it was snapped on January 20, 2003, against the Montreal Canadiens. In his fourth season with the Panthers (2003\u201304), Luongo emerged with his first Vezina Trophy and Lester B. Pearson Award nominations as the top goaltender and top player as selected by the players, respectively. Playing in 72 games, he set NHL marks for most saves and shots faced in a single season with 2,303 and 2,475, respectively. Both marks were previously set by former Islanders teammate F\u00e9lix Potvin in 1996\u201397 as a Toronto Maple Leaf. His resulting .931 save percentage was first among those goalies with at least 50 starts and set a Panthers franchise record, breaking Vanbiesbrouck's .924 mark, set in 1993\u201394. His seven shutouts furthered his franchise record and was good enough for fifth in the league. At mid-season, he was named to his first NHL All-Star Game, held in February 2004. Competing for the Eastern Conference, he won the Goaltenders Competition segment of the SuperSkills Competition, allowing the fewest goals on goaltender-related events. The following day, he played in the third period of the All-Star Game and helped the East to a 6\u20134 win against the West. At the end of the season, he was named to the Second NHL All-Star Team, but lost the Vezina Trophy to fellow Montreal-native Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils, while Martin St. Louis of the Tampa Bay Lightning won the Pearson Award. Owing to the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout, Luongo was inactive, with the exception of two international tournaments, the 2004 World Cup and the 2005 World Championships. With the NHL set to resume in 2005\u201306, Luongo was without a contract. After negotiations failed, the Panthers filed for arbitration on August 11, 2005. The process awarded Luongo a one-year, $3.2\u00a0million contract on August 25. On April 13, 2006, Luongo became the most-wins Panthers goaltender of all-time, passing Vanbiesbrouck, with his 107th win with the team \u2013 a 5\u20134 overtime victory against the Ottawa Senators. He went on to post 35 wins, breaking Vanbiesbrouck's 27-win single-season Panthers mark, set in 1996\u201397. Set to become a free agent for the second consecutive off-season, he could not come to an agreement with the Panthers, having formally turned down a five-year, $30\u00a0million contract offer in January 2006. It was also reported that among Luongo's demands were that backup goaltender Jamie McLennan be re-signed, his long-time goaltending coach Fran\u00e7ois Allaire be hired and that a public statement be released that he would not be traded until the no-trade clause of his contract took effect."

        "content": "Prior to the start of the 2006\u201307 season, Panthers general manager Mike Keenan traded Luongo to the Vancouver Canucks on June 23, 2006. He was packaged with defenceman Luk\u00e1\u0161 Kraj\u00ed\u010dek and a sixth round draft pick (Sergei Shirokov) in exchange for forward Todd Bertuzzi, defenceman Bryan Allen and goaltender Alex Auld. Immediately following the deal, Vancouver signed Luongo to a four-year, $27 million deal. He expressed surprise, claiming that he and the Panthers were very close to a deal the day before the trade. Luongo's arrival in Vancouver ended a seven-and-a-half-year period of instability for Canucks netminding, with a total of 18 goaltenders having played for the club since Kirk McLean's departure in 1998. General manager Brian Burke had coined the term \"goalie graveyard\" during his tenure in Vancouver to describe the club's goaltending fortunes. Luongo recorded a 3\u20131 win against the Detroit Red Wings in his Canucks debut on October 5, 2006. Later in the month, he notched his first shutout with the Canucks, stopping 32 shots in a 5\u20130 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on October 25. On January 9, 2007, Luongo was voted in as a starting goaltender for the first time in his career for the Western Conference All-Stars. Six days after the announcement, he was hospitalized after taking a puck to the throat in practice. He spent the night in the intensive care unit for fears his windpipe would swell and become blocked. Discharged from the hospital on game day, Luongo recorded a shutout that night against the Montreal Canadiens on January 16, 2007. During the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas, Luongo was named the Skills Competition's top goaltender and helped the West to a 12\u20139 win over the East. Late in the season, Luongo recorded his franchise record-setting 39th win in a 2\u20131 overtime victory on March 9. He surpassed Kirk McLean's 38-win mark set in 1991\u201392. He went on to finish with a career-high 47 wins, one shy of league-leader Martin Brodeur, who broke Bernie Parent's thirty-three-year-old NHL record of wins in a season. Luongo and Brodeur are considered, however, to have been given an advantage to Parent with the inauguration of the shootout that season by the NHL, allowing more games to be decided with wins, as opposed to ties. In addition to his 47 wins, Luongo recorded a 2.29 GAA (which was at that time, a personal best) and a team-record .921 save percentage (surpassing Dan Cloutier's .914 save percentage in 2003\u201304; later broken by Cory Schneider's .929 save percentage in 2010\u201311). He won three team awards \u2013 the Cyclone Taylor Trophy as MVP, the Molson Cup as the player with the most three-star selections, and the Most Exciting Player Award. He led the Canucks to a Northwest Division title and what was then a franchise record of 105 points, The team was seeded third in the Western Conference. The 2007 playoffs marked Luongo's first NHL post-season appearance. Facing the Dallas Stars in the opening round, he almost set an NHL record for most saves in a playoff game in his post-season debut. He stopped 72 shots, en route to a 5\u20134 quadruple overtime victory, one save shy of Kelly Hrudey's 73-save mark set in 1987. Luongo went on to win his first playoff series as the Canucks eliminated the Stars in seven games. They were, however, defeated in the second round by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Anaheim Ducks. Luongo put forth a losing 56-save performance in the deciding fifth game against the Ducks. After the game ended in regulation at a 1\u20131 tie, he missed the first three minutes of the first overtime period to what was first believed to be an equipment malfunction. However, after the series ended, it was revealed that Luongo, instead, had an untimely case of diarrhea. The Canucks lost the game 2\u20131 in the second overtime when Luongo took his eye off the puck to look at the referee, believing a penalty should have been issued to the Ducks on a play in which Canucks forward Jannik Hansen was hit by Ducks forward Rob Niedermayer. With Luongo not paying attention, Ducks defenceman Scott Niedermayer shot the puck from the point to score the series-winning goal. At the end of the season, Luongo was nominated for three major NHL awards: the Vezina Trophy, Lester B. Pearson Award and Hart Memorial Trophy as the league MVP. However, Luongo finished second in the voting for all three awards, behind Brodeur for the Vezina and Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins for the Hart and Pearson. Luongo kept pace statistically with his previous season's work in 2007\u201308 and continued to set significant marks, including a three-game shutout streak spanning 210:34 in late-November (breaking the Canucks' previous franchise record of 184:20 set by Ken Lockett in 1975). He was voted in as the 2008 NHL All-Star Game's Western Conference starting goalie for the second consecutive season, although he did not attend in order to be with his pregnant wife in Florida. With the Canucks battling for the Northwest Division title all season long, a losing streak that saw Luongo win only one of his final eight starts caused the Canucks to miss the playoffs altogether. Nevertheless, he received his second consecutive team MVP and Molson Cup awards. He also finished seventh in Vezina Trophy balloting. On September 30, 2008, prior to the start of the 2008\u201309 season, Vancouver Canucks general manager Mike Gillis and head coach Alain Vigneault named Luongo the 12th captain in team history, replacing the departed Markus N\u00e4slund. The decision was unconventional, as league rules forbid goaltenders from being captains. As such, Luongo became only the seventh goaltender in NHL history to be named a captain, and the first since Bill Durnan captained the Montreal Canadiens in 1947\u201348 (after which the league implemented the rule). In order to account for the league rule, Luongo did not perform any of the on-ice duties reserved for captains and did not wear the captain's \"C\" on his jersey. Instead he incorporated it into the artwork on the front of one of his masks which he occasionally wore for the early months of the 2008\u201309 season. Canucks defenceman Willie Mitchell was designated to handle communications with on-ice officials, while defenceman Mattias \u00d6hlund was responsible for ceremonial faceoffs and other such formalities associated with captaincy. Centre Ryan Kesler was chosen along with Mitchell and \u00d6hlund as the third alternate captain. A month into the 2008\u201309 season, Luongo began a shutout streak that lasted three games against the Nashville Predators, Phoenix Coyotes, and the Minnesota Wild, akin to the feat he accomplished in the same month of November the previous year. His overall shutout streak was snapped at 242:36 minutes, in a 2\u20131 shootout loss against the Colorado Avalanche, surpassing the Canucks record he set the previous season. Later that month, on November 22, Luongo left a game versus the Pittsburgh Penguins after suffering an adductor strain in his groin. Initially listed as week-to-week, he attempted what was considered an early comeback within two weeks of the injury, but suffered a setback during a team practice on December 10, leaving early in discomfort. After missing 24 games, Luongo made his return on January 15, 2009, in a 4\u20131 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes. While injured, Luongo was chosen for the fourth time to the NHL All-Star Game in 2009 as the lone Canucks representative. Despite speculation he would have to miss his second straight All-Star Game, Luongo recovered in time and took part in a 12\u201311 shootout loss to the Eastern Conference. He finished the season with back-to-back shutouts in the final two games against the Los Angeles Kings and Colorado Avalanche to establish a new career-high of nine shutouts on the season, breaking Dan Cloutier's previous franchise single-season shutout record of seven, set in 2001\u201302. Winning their second Northwest Division title in three years, Luongo and the Canucks returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence. During the 2009 playoffs, he led the Canucks to a first round sweep of the St. Louis Blues. The Canucks then faced the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round, which Chicago ultimately won in six games. Luongo was heavily criticized following his performance in the sixth and deciding game, allowing seven goals in the 7\u20135 loss. In a post-game interview, Luongo told reporters that he \"let [his] teammates down\". Many in the Vancouver media were quick to suggest trading Luongo, arguing that his large salary could be better spent, while pointing to several successful teams with relatively low-salary goalies. Nevertheless, Luongo was presented at the year-end awards ceremony with the Scotiabank Fan Fav Award, a fan-voted award in its inaugural year for the league's favourite player. Also finishing fourth in Vezina Trophy voting, he missed out on his second nomination in three years by one vote, behind Niklas B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m of the Minnesota Wild, Steve Mason of the Columbus Blue Jackets and trophy-winner Tim Thomas of the Boston Bruins."

        "content": "With one season left on his original four-year deal with the Canucks, Luongo and agent Gilles Lupien began contract negotiations with general manager Mike Gillis in the 2009 off-season. At the time of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, ESPN reported that Luongo and the Canucks had agreed on a long-term extension to be announced on July 1. The report was, however, denied by both Lupien and Gillis. A little over a month later in early August, Gillis told Vancouver sports radio station TEAM 1040 in an interview that he was \"philosophically\" close to a deal with Luongo to be signed before the upcoming 2009\u201310 season. That same month, while at Team Canada's summer camp for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Luongo set a September 13 deadline to sign a contract before the Canucks' training camp began, explaining that he \"will not be negotiating during the season ... [not wanting] that distraction\". Several days later, on September 2, the Canucks announced that they had signed Luongo to a 12-year contract extension worth $64\u00a0million for a $5.33\u00a0million annual salary cap hit. The front-loaded deal, which will expire by the time Luongo is 43 and includes a no-trade clause, sees him make $10\u00a0million in 2010\u201311, then approximately $6.7\u00a0million annually through to 2017\u201318, $3.3\u00a0million and $1.6\u00a0million the subsequent two seasons, before tailing off to $1\u00a0million for the final two years. The contract contains two additional clauses to circumvent the no-trade clause that allow Luongo to facilitate a trade after the fifth year and for the Canucks to also facilitate a trade after the seventh year. Nearly a month into the 2009\u201310 season, on October 25, 2009, Luongo recorded his 21st shutout as a Canuck (48th career) in a 2\u20130 win against the Edmonton Oilers, surpassing Kirk McLean as the franchise shutouts leader. The following game against the Detroit Red Wings on October 27, he suffered a rib injury that was revealed the following day to be a hairline fracture. Luongo originally injured his rib two games prior against the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 24 after taking a shot in the chest from Leafs' forward Niklas Hagman. The injury was re-aggravated during the Detroit game during a collision with Red Wings forward Todd Bertuzzi. He returned to the lineup on November 10 after missing six games. On January 7, 2010, Luongo recorded his 50th career shutout in a 4\u20130 win against the Phoenix Coyotes. Despite recording the second 40-win season of his career, Luongo finished with his worst statistical season as a Canuck, heavily affected by a poor second-half. Pulled seven times in 68 appearances, he recorded a 2.57 GAA and a .913 save percentage. In the subsequent 2010 playoffs, the Canucks defeated the Los Angeles Kings in six games only to be defeated by the Chicago Blackhawks for the second year in a row. In the off-season, it was speculated by many in the media whether Luongo would remain Vancouver's captain, citing the added pressure of the goaltending position. After the Canucks' 3\u20131 series deficit in the second round, Luongo ceased to make himself available for pre-game interviews \u2013 a customary practice for goaltenders, but not for captains. When asked after the Canucks' elimination whether he thought he should remain team captain, he told reporters he did not think it was an issue. However, Gillis, who appointed him captain two seasons prior, asserted it was a topic to be addressed in the off-season. On September 13, 2010, Luongo confirmed he was stepping down, stating that \"Serv[ing] as captain...in a Canadian city for a team with such passionate fans is a privilege and an experience I will always take pride in. I will continue to be a leader on this team and support my teammates the same way I always have while focusing on our ultimate goal.\" Centre Henrik Sedin, who won the Hart Trophy for the 2009\u201310 season, was named Luongo's successor in a pre-game ceremony to the Canucks' season-opener. Also in the off-season, Gillis fired Luongo's goaltending coach Ian Clark and hired Roland Melanson in his place. Luongo had been a personal friend of Clark's and publicly stated being surprised and disappointed with the switch. The decision to hire Melanson was largely precipitated on his willingness to work with Luongo on a full-time basis \u2013 something Clark was unable to do. Despite the coaching change at the club level, Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training. He began working with Melanson leading up to the 2010\u201311 season and employed several changes in his playing style, which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters. During the 2010 pre-season, Luongo sustained a groin injury, but recovered in time for the regular season. Midway through the campaign, Luongo was named the NHL's Second Star of the Month for December 2010. He posted an 11\u20131\u20132 record with a 2.07 GAA, a .922 save percentage and one shutout. During the month, he started a 21-game regulation unbeaten streak that lasted until a loss against the St. Louis Blues on February 14, 2011. Luongo's record in that span was 16 wins and 5 overtime or shootout losses. Later in the campaign, he recorded his 300th career win against the Los Angeles Kings on March 5, 2011. He became the 6th-youngest goaltender to reach the milestone and the 25th overall. The 2010\u201311 season constituted a decreased workload for Luongo, as he appeared in 60 games. Team management had asserted at the beginning of the campaign that rookie backup Cory Schneider would be given the opportunity to play in 20 to 25 games. Luongo finished the season with a league-leading 38 wins, along with 22 losses (15 in regulation and 7 in overtime or a shootout). His career-high 2.11 GAA ranked second in the league, behind Tim Thomas' 2.00, and set a Canucks record, surpassing Dan Cloutier's 2.27 GAA, set in 2003\u201304. While his .928 save percentage improved upon his team-record setting .921 in 2006\u201307, it was bettered by one-hundredth of a point by Schneider. Together, Luongo and Schneider won the William M. Jennings Trophy for leading the Canucks to the lowest GAA in the league; their combined 2.20 GAA was one-tenth better than the Boston Bruins's second-place goaltending tandem of Tim Thomas and Tuukka Rask. Luongo helped the Canucks to their first Presidents' Trophy in team history with an NHL-best and franchise-record 54 wins and 117 points. His efforts in the regular season earned him his third career Vezina Trophy nomination, alongside the Boston Bruins' Tim Thomas and the Nashville Predators' Pekka Rinne."

        "content": "Entering the 2011 playoffs as the first seed in the West, the Canucks were matched against the Blackhawks for the third straight year. After opening the series with three straight wins, the Canucks lost the next three, forcing a seventh game. After he was pulled in favour of Schneider during Games 4 and 5 \u2013 having allowed six and four goals, respectively \u2013 Luongo started Game 6 on the bench. During the third period, Schneider suffered an injury, forcing Luongo to finish the game. He made 12 saves in relief of Schneider before Blackhawks forward Ben Smith scored in overtime. Although Schneider was available to play for Game 7, Vigneault chose to start Luongo. He made 31 saves in the deciding game, helping the Canucks to a 2\u20131 overtime win. His efforts included a cross-ice save on a one-timer from forward Patrick Sharp during a Blackhawks powerplay early on in the extra period. Going head-to-head against fellow Vezina Trophy nominee Pekka Rinne and the Nashville Predators in round two, Luongo kept Nashville to 11 goals over 6 games to help the Canucks advance. He maintained his performance in the Conference Finals against the San Jose Sharks, allowing 13 goals over 5 contests, including 54 saves in the fifth and deciding match, a game that went to double overtime. Luongo's efforts helped the Canucks reach the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 17 years. He opened the series against the Boston Bruins stopping all 36 shots in a 1\u20130 win for his third shutout of the post-season. As the series shifted to Boston's TD Garden with a two-games-to-none Canucks lead, Luongo surrendered eight goals in Game 3. The following contest, he was pulled for the third time in the playoffs after allowing 4 goals on 20 shots. Amidst heavy scrutiny from the media and Canucks fans, Luongo recovered for Game 5, stopping all 31 Bruins shots in a 1\u20130 win. It was his 15th win and 4th shutout of the post-season, tying both of Kirk McLean's single-year playoff team records, previously set in 1994. With an opportunity to clinch the Stanley Cup in Game 6, however, he was pulled again after allowing three goals in less than three minutes in the first period; the game ended in a 5\u20132 loss. Starting for the deciding seventh game, he allowed 3 goals on 20 shots, including one shorthanded goal, as the Canucks lost 4\u20130. Luongo had the chance of joining the Triple Gold Club as the first goaltender in this finals series."

        "content": "Nearly a month-and-a-half into the 2011\u201312 season, Luongo suffered an upper-body injury that sidelined him for two games. The nature of the injury was unspecified, but was believed to have occurred during a game against the Islanders on November 13, 2011, when he appeared to be in discomfort. Prior to the injury, Luongo was struggling to perform with his statistics near the bottom of the league. Upon recovering, Schneider's play relegated Luongo to backup status for five games. By December, he resumed as the team's starter with improved performance. The following month, Luongo reached two milestones. On January 4, 2012, he became the 23rd goalie in league history to play in his 700th game, a contest in which he recorded a 3\u20130 shutout against the Wild. With his 212th victory as a Canuck on January 21 (a 4\u20133 win against the Sharks), he surpassed Kirk McLean as the most-wins goalie in team history. Luongo accomplished the feat in 364 games, 152 less than McLean. Facing the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Kings in the opening round of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, Luongo started the first two games and played well but his team lost both. Vigneault opted to start Schneider for the rest of the series, in order to give the Canucks some momentum, and Luongo remained on the bench for the remainder of the series as the Kings won four games to one. Dressing as a backup for the Canucks' final three playoff games led many in the media to believe that Luongo would be traded in the off-season, in favour of Schneider, who recorded better regular season and playoff statistics than him in 2011\u201312. Asked about his role with the Canucks following the defeat, Luongo told reporters that he would waive his no-trade clause if his management asked him to do so. In June 2012, Schneider was signed to a three-year $12 million contract, which made Luongo expendable, but general manager Mike Gillis' efforts to trade Luongo were unsuccessful owing to his $64 million (U.S.), 12-year contract. In the lockout-shortened 2012\u201313 NHL season, both goaltenders split the playing duties although Schneider was the number one goalie. Luongo handled his demotion with class and remained supportive of Schneider, soon calling the Canucks \"Cory's team.\" Head coach Alain Vigneault said \"Cory is our MVP and one of reasons why we got into playoffs. I've got a lot of faith in him and that's why we're going with him\". In the opening playoff round facing the San Jose Sharks, as Schneider had been injured near the end of the regular season, Luongo started the first two games and played well but his team lost both. Luongo came off the bench in game three after Schneider was pulled in the third period. Luongo was the backup in game four as the Canucks lost in overtime, ending his team's postseason in four straight games. Luongo put his penthouse up for sale, as it was accepted that he had played his final game as a Canuck. Although he had nine years left on a 12-year, $64-million contract, which represented a $5.33 million salary cap hit, general manager Mike Gillis remained confident of making a deal in the summer. Schneider was unexpectedly traded to the New Jersey Devils on June 30, 2013, reinstating Luongo in the starting position for the 2013\u201314 NHL season. John Tortorella, who had replaced Alain Vigneault as Canucks head coach after the conclusion of the 2012\u201313 season, chose rookie Eddie L\u00e4ck to start in goal instead of Luongo in the Heritage Classic against the Ottawa Senators at BC Place. Tortorella's decision was unpopular with the crowd as they booed L\u00e4ck, while Luongo was also unhappy as he had been looking forward to that game all season."

The Canucks retained part of Luongo's salary. Luongo was seen as key to helping build the Panthers into a strong contender. During the 2017\u201318 season, Luongo played in his 1,000th NHL game, becoming just the third goaltender in NHL history to do so, the other two being Patrick Roy and Martin Brodeur. At the conclusion of the regular season, Luongo was the Panthers' nomination for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy and became the franchise all-time leader in games played, wins, and shutouts. On February 10, 2019, Roberto Luongo played in his 1030th career game, passing Roy for second all-time behind Brodeur, who played 1,266 games in his career. With a 4\u20133 win against the Colorado Avalanche on February 25, Luongo passed Ed Belfour for third-most wins as an NHL goaltender, once again behind Roy and Brodeur. On June 26, 2019, Luongo announced his retirement from professional hockey. The Panthers would then retire his number on March 7, 2020, with Luongo becoming the first player to earn this honor with the franchise."

        "content": "Luongo made his international debut at the 1995 World U-17 Hockey Challenge in Moncton, New Brunswick, with Team Qu\u00e9bec, winning bronze. Three years later, he was named to the Canadian national junior team for the 1998 World Junior Championships in Finland. He played backup to Victoriaville Tigres goaltender Mathieu Garon, going winless in three appearances with a 3.70 GAA, as Canada finished in eighth place. Luongo became the starting goaltender the following year at the 1999 World Junior Championships in Winnipeg, Manitoba, appearing in seven of Canada's eight games. He recorded a shutout in the first game of the tournament against the Czech Republic, making 36 saves in a 0\u20130 tie. He went on to help Team Canada to the gold medal game against Russia, but lost in overtime, surrendering a goal to Artem Chubarov. With a 1.92 GAA and two shutouts, Luongo was given Best Goaltender and All-Star Team honours. Luongo first appeared with the Canadian men's team at the 2001 World Championships in Germany. He played backup to Fred Brathwaite of the Calgary Flames before injuring his finger during the first game of the qualification round against Switzerland on May 4, 2001. During his next appearance at the 2003 World Championships in Finland, Luongo began the tournament as backup to the Phoenix Coyotes' Sean Burke. He earned wins against Latvia in the preliminaries and Switzerland in the qualifying round. During the semifinals against the Czech Republic, Luongo replaced Burke after he left the game with a lower-body injury eight minutes into the second period. Luongo allowed four goals in relief, but earned the win as Canada defeated the Czechs 8\u20134. With Burke still out for the gold medal game, Luongo made 49 saves against Sweden in a 3\u20132 overtime win. Despite Luongo's medal-round efforts, Burke was named the Best Goaltender for the tournament, as he played in the majority of Team Canada's games. The gold-medal winning 2003 team was later named the Canadian Press national sports team of the year on January 2, 2004. Luongo made his third appearance at the World Championships in 2004 in the Czech Republic. He played in seven games as the starting goaltender, recording a 2.32 GAA and one shutout, as Canada captured its second straight gold medal at the tournament, beating Sweden 5\u20133 in the final. Several months later, Luongo competed for Team Canada in the 2004 World Cup as backup to Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils. It marked Luongo's first international tournament in which all NHL players were eligible, as the annual World Championships conflict with the Stanley Cup playoffs. He had another opportunity to step in as the starting goalie when Brodeur pulled out prior to the semi-final game against the Czech Republic due to a sprained wrist. Filling in for Brodeur, Luongo made 37 of 40 stops in a 4\u20133 overtime victory to put Team Canada into the finals against Finland. Brodeur returned for the championship game to backstop Team Canada to a 3\u20132 win. Luongo appeared in his fourth World Championships in 2005. Owing to the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout, all NHL players were available for the tournament in Austria, and Luongo played backup to Brodeur. He appeared in two games, including a shutout win against Slovenia in the round-robin. Luongo earned a silver medal as Team Canada was shut out by the Czech Republic 3\u20130 in the final. Luongo was named to his first Winter Olympics in 2006. The tournament was held in Turin, Italy, his country of cultural origin. He again played behind Brodeur and appeared in two games. He made his Olympic debut in the second game of the round-robin with a 5\u20131 win against Germany. His second appearance of the tournament was a loss to Finland, also in the round-robin. Leading up to the 2010 Winter Olympics, to be held in Luongo's NHL hometown of Vancouver, Luongo and Brodeur were considered locks to be named to the national team heading into the summer orientation camp in August 2009 and speculation began as to who would be appointed the starting position. On December 31, 2009, Luongo was selected to Team Canada, along with Brodeur and Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury of the Pittsburgh Penguins as the three goaltenders. Luongo was given the start for the first game against Norway. He recorded his first Olympic shutout, making 15 saves in an 8\u20130 win to open the tournament. After Brodeur surrendered four goals in a 5\u20133 loss to the United States in their final preliminary game, Luongo replaced him as the starting goalie. He helped Canada to four consecutive single-elimination game wins against Germany, Russia, Slovakia and the United States to capture the gold medal. During the semifinal against Slovakia, Luongo made a game-saving stop against Canucks teammate Pavol Demitra with nine seconds to go in regulation. With Slovakia's goaltender pulled and down by a goal, the puck bounced to Demitra by the side of the net. Out of position, Luongo managed to get his glove on the puck, deflecting it away from the net and preserving the win. In the subsequent gold medal game, Luongo made 34 saves in Canada's overtime win against the United States. The following month, Luongo carried the torch into Robson Square in Downtown Vancouver for the 2010 Paralympics on March 11, 2010. Four years later, Luongo was selected to Team Canada for his third straight Olympics. Heading into the Sochi Games as the incumbent starter, there was much debate among the media as to whether he or Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price would play most of Canada's games."

        "title": "Roberto Luongo_Playing style",
        "content": "Luongo played in the butterfly style of goaltending, dropping to his knees with his skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net. Owing to the style of play, groin injuries are common for butterfly goalies. Luongo suffered one during the 2008\u201309 season and missed 24 games. An athletic goaltender, Luongo was known for having quick reflexes, particularly with his glove. One of Luongo's early goaltending coaches, Fran\u00e7ois Allaire, remembered Luongo to have had the \"best catching glove [he'd] ever seen in a kid\" when he first came to his goaltending school in Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-Gasp\u00e9, Qu\u00e9bec, at the age of 14. Allaire is known to be a strong proponent of the butterfly style. At 6 feet and 3\u00a0inches, Luongo was able to cover a lot of net with his size. Observers also noted the strong concentration, competitiveness and mental aspects of his game. On the other hand, his puck-handling skills have been described as a weakness. His style began to be directed during his midget years with Allaire and Montreal-Bourassa goaltending coach Mario Baril. Luongo sent tapes of his play to Allaire during his rookie season in the QMJHL and his former goaltending coach advised him to be more aggressive and come out of the net more to cut off angles and challenge shooters. Later in his NHL career, the Canucks hired a new goaltending coach, Roland Melanson, prior to the 2010\u201311 season. Working with Melanson, Luongo began playing deeper in his crease against Allaire's original advice, allowing him to maintain positioning for rebounds. Vancouver Canucks head coach Alain Vigneault said that Luongo played best with more playing time over the length of the season. Throughout his career, he garnered lots of playing time, including four consecutive 70-game seasons from 2003\u201304 to 2007\u201308 between the Florida Panthers and Canucks. He was known to suffer from slow starts to the season, usually in the first month of October. In his first three Octobers with the Canucks, Luongo posted a combined 10\u201313\u20130 record and a .899 save percentage \u2013 numbers that are well below his career pace. Luongo received the Mark Messier Leadership Award in his first season with the Canucks for the month of March 2007. Prior to his third season with Vancouver, he was named Markus N\u00e4slund's successor as team captain and the first goaltender to be named a captain in 59 years. Teammate Mattias \u00d6hlund, who served as alternate captain to Luongo for one season, described him as a vocal leader, while Luongo has also identified that quality in himself. General manager Mike Gillis described his commitment level as \"unprecedented\", adding that \"he'd be a great example for our younger guys\", at the time of the captaincy announcement. He served in that capacity for two seasons before relinquishing the captaincy prior to the 2010\u201311 season."

Gina is the daughter of the Italian restaurant owner, Umberto Cerbone, who is originally from Naples, while Gina's mother is from Palermo. Luongo proposed to Gina under the Bridge of Sighs in Venice in 2004.  They lived in Broward County, Florida, during his tenure with the Panthers. However within a month of moving into a new home in Florida, Luongo was traded to Vancouver. They subsequently moved into the Vancouver neighbourhood of Yaletown, while spending Luongo's off-seasons in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their daughter was born on March 27, 2008. Luongo had been chosen as a starting goaltender for the 2008 NHL All-Star Game, but he chose not to attend in order to be with Gina, who was pregnant at the time and had returned to Florida. On December 27, 2010, Gina gave birth to the couple's son. Luongo is involved with several charities. Like many Canucks players, he spent time with Canuck Place, a children's hospice in Vancouver. He also sponsored a spectator's box in Rogers Arena that was reserved for underprivileged children to attend Canucks games. At the end of games in which he was named one of the three stars, he was known to give away his goalie stick to a fan in the crowd. In the summer of 2009, he hosted the Roberto Luongo Golf Open to benefit Montreal Children's Hospital, Sainte-Justine Hospital, and a seniors centre network in Saint-L\u00e9onard. After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Luongo, who lives in Parkland, gave a pre-game speech acknowledging the victims of the shooting and calling for action against mass shootings. In addition to being an avid golfer, Luongo also enjoys playing poker. In September 2011, Luongo was inducted into the Italian Walk of Fame in Toronto, Ontario."

        "content": "Joshua Gibson (December 21, 1911 \u2013 January 20, 1947) was an American baseball catcher primarily in the Negro leagues. Baseball historians consider Gibson among the best power hitters and catchers in baseball history. In 1972, he became the second Negro league player to be inducted in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Gibson played for the Homestead Grays from 1930 to 1931, moved to the Pittsburgh Crawfords from 1932 to 1936, and returned to the Grays from 1937 to 1939 and 1942 to 1946. In 1937, he played for Ciudad Trujillo in Trujillo's Dominican League and from 1940 to 1941, he played in the Mexican League for Rojos del \u00c1guila de Veracruz. Gibson served as the first manager of the Santurce Crabbers, one of the most historic franchises of the Puerto Rico Baseball League. Gibson was known as a spectacular power hitter who, by some accounts, hit close to 800 career home runs. He was known as the \"black Babe Ruth\"; in fact, some fans at the time who saw both Ruth and Gibson play called Ruth \"the white Josh Gibson\". Gibson never played in the major leagues because of the unwritten \"gentleman's agreement\" that prevented non-white players from participating. He stood  and weighed  at the peak of his career. He was the first player since Oscar Charleston to win consecutive batting Triple Crowns (leading the league in home runs, runs batted in, batting average) and no batter has achieved the feat since. On December 16, 2020, Major League Baseball announced that it will recognize Negro league records, giving Gibson the second-highest single-season major league batting average at .466 (1943)."

        "content": "Gibson was born in Buena Vista, Georgia, to Mark and Nancy (Woodlock) Gibson and had a younger brother, fellow Negro leaguer Jerry, and sister. In 1923, Gibson moved to Pittsburgh, and his father found work at the Carnegie-Illinois Steel Company. Entering sixth grade in Pittsburgh, Gibson prepared to become an electrician, attending Allegheny Pre-Vocational School and Conroy Pre-Vocational School. His first experience playing baseball for an organized team came at age 16 when he played third base for an amateur team sponsored by Gimbels department store where he found work as an elevator operator. Shortly thereafter, he was recruited by the Pittsburgh Crawfords, which in 1928 were still a semi-professional team. The Crawfords, controlled by Gus Greenlee, were the top black semi-professional team in the Pittsburgh area and would advance to fully professional, major Negro league status by 1931. In 1928, Gibson met Helen Mason, whom he married on March 7, 1929. When not playing baseball, Gibson continued to work at Gimbels! After he had given up on his plans to become an electrician to pursue a baseball career. In the summer of 1930, the 18-year-old Gibson was picked up by the Memphis Red Sox for a game in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Despite going 2 for 4, Red Sox manager Candy Jim Taylor was not impressed by Gibson and said afterward that he would never be a catcher. He was then recruited by Cumberland Posey, owner of the Homestead Grays, which were the preeminent Negro league team in Pittsburgh; Gibson debuted with the Grays on July 31, 1930. On August 11, Gibson's wife, pregnant with twins, went into premature labor and died while giving birth to a twin son, Josh Gibson Jr., and daughter, Helen, named after her mother. Helen's parents raised the children."

        "content": "The Negro leagues generally found it more profitable to schedule relatively few league games and allow the teams to earn extra money through barnstorming against semi-professional and other non-league teams. Thus, it is important to distinguish between records against all competition and records in league games only. For example, against all levels of competition, Gibson hit 69 home runs in 1934; the same year, in 52 league games, he hit 11 home runs. In 1933, he hit .467 with 55 home runs in 137 games against all levels of competition. His lifetime batting average is said to be higher than .350, with other sources putting it as high as .384, the best in Negro league history. In 2021, it was announced by Major League Baseball that the Negro Leagues (1920\u20131948) would formally be recognized as a major league. Ongoing research by Baseball Reference tabulated that Gibson led his league three times in batting average and once for all major leagues, most notably hitting .417 in 1937. He also led six times in on-base percentage and slugging percentage eight times. Gibson's Hall of Fame plaque claims he hit \"almost 800 home runs in league and independent baseball during his 17-year career.\" This figure includes vs. semi-pro competition and in exhibition games. According to the Hall's official data, his lifetime batting average was .359. It was reported that he won nine home run titles and four batting championships playing for the Crawfords and the Grays. It is also believed that Gibson hit a home run in a Negro league game at Yankee Stadium that struck two feet from the top of the wall circling the center field bleachers, about  from home plate. Chicago American Giants infielder Jack Marshall said Gibson slugged one over the third deck next to the left-field bullpen in 1934 for the only fair ball hit out of Yankee Stadium. There is no published or film account to support this claim. Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith once said that Gibson hit more home runs into Griffith Stadium's distant left field bleachers than the entire American League."

        "content": "The true statistical achievements of Negro league players may be impossible to know as the Negro leagues did not compile complete statistics or game summaries. Based on the research of historical accounts performed for the Special Committee on the Negro Leagues, Gibson hit 224 homers in 2,375 at-bats against top black teams, two in 56 at-bats against white major-league pitchers, and 44 in 450 at-bats in the Mexican League. John Holway lists Gibson with the same home run totals and a .351 career average, plus 21-for-56 against white major-league pitchers. According to Holway, Gibson ranks third all-time in the Negro leagues in average among players with 2,000+ at-bats (trailing Jud Wilson by three points and John Beckwith by one). Holway lists him as being second to Mule Suttles in homers, though the all-time leader in HR/AB by a considerable margin \u2014 with a homer every 10.6 at-bats to one every 13.6 for runner-up Suttles. Recent investigations into Negro league statistics, using box scores from newspapers from across the United States, have led to the estimate that, although as many as two-thirds of Negro league team games were played against inferior competition (as traveling exhibition games), Gibson still hit between 150 and 200 home runs in official Negro league games. Though this number appears very conservative next to the claims of \"almost 800\" to 1,000 home runs, this research also credits Gibson with a rate of one home run every 15.9 at-bats, which compares favorably with the rates of the top nine home run hitters in Major League history. The commonly cited home run totals in excess of 800 are not indicative of his career total in \"official\" games because the Negro league season was significantly shorter than the Major League season; typically consisting of fewer than 60 games per year. The additional home runs cited were most likely accomplished in \"unofficial\" games against local and non-Negro league competition of varying strengths, including the oft-cited \"barnstorming\" competitions. In nine of his seasons played in the Negro Leagues, he was selected to the East\u2013West All-Star Game twelve times, which included double duty appearances in 1939 (playing at Comiskey Park and Yankee Stadium), 1942 (Yankee Stadium and Griffith Stadium), and 1946 (Griffith and Comiskey)."

After regaining consciousness, he refused the option of surgical removal and lived the next four years with recurring headaches. In 1944, Gibson was hospitalized in Washington, D.C. at Gallinger Hospital for mental observation. On January 20, 1947, Gibson died of a stroke at 35 years old in Pittsburgh. He was buried at the Allegheny Cemetery in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh, where he lay in an unmarked grave until a small plaque was placed in 1975."

Doby said in an interview later, \"One of the things that was disappointing and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. I think that's one of the reasons why Josh died so early \u2014 he was heartbroken.\" In 1972, Gibson and Buck Leonard became the second and third players, behind Satchel Paige, inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame based on their careers in the Negro leagues. Gibson's Hall of Fame plaque claims \"almost 800\" home runs for his career, although this number cannot be substantiated. Although validation of statistics continues to prove difficult for Negro league players, the lack of verifiable figures has led to various amusing tall tales about players such as Gibson. An example of such:  In the bottom of the ninth at Pittsburgh, down a run, with a runner on base and two outs, Gibson hits one high and deep, so far into the twilight sky that it disappears, apparently winning the game. The next day, the same two teams are playing again, now in Washington. Just as the teams have positioned themselves on the field, a ball falls out of the sky, and a Washington outfielder grabs it. The umpire yells to Gibson, \"You're out! In Pittsburgh, yesterday!\" The U.S. Postal Service issued a 33-cent U.S. commemorative postage stamp which features a painting of Gibson and includes his name. In 2000, he ranked 18th on The Sporting News''' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the highest-ranking of five players to have played all or most of their careers in the Negro leagues. (The others were Satchel Paige, Buck Leonard, Cool Papa Bell and Oscar Charleston.) He was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in the same year. At PNC Park, home of Pittsburgh's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, an exhibit honoring the city's two Negro league baseball teams was introduced in 2006. Located by the stadium's left field entrance and named Legacy Square, the display featured statues of seven players who competed for the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords, including Gibson. In 2015, without any public announcement, the Pirates removed all seven statues from the Legacy Square area. Ultimately, they were donated to the Josh Gibson Foundation and sold at auction to benefit the Foundation. Most of the statues that were originally located at Legacy Square in PNC Park, including Gibson's, are now displayed at the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. In 2009, a statue of Gibson was installed inside the center field gate of Nationals Park along with ones of Frank Howard and Walter Johnson. He was named to the Washington Nationals Ring of Honor for his \"significant contribution to the game of baseball in Washington, D.C\" as part of the Homestead Grays on August 10, 2010. Ammon Field in Pittsburgh was renamed Josh Gibson Field in his honor and is the site of a Pennsylvania State Historical Marker. His son, Josh Gibson, Jr., played baseball for the Homestead Grays. His son also was instrumental in the forming of the Josh Gibson Foundation. An opera based on Josh Gibson's life, The Summer King, by composer Daniel Sonenberg, premiered on April 29, 2017, in Pittsburgh."

Gibson was said by Buck O'Neil to have created a particular sound like dynamite when he hit the ball that he had heard only three times during his lifetime in baseball. Babe Ruth was the first, when O'Neil was young, Gibson was the second, when his Homestead Grays came to play O'Neil's Kansas City Monarchs, and Bo Jackson was the third, 50 years later, when Jackson was called up by the Kansas City Royals and O'Neil was a scout for the Chicago Cubs."

In a career spanning 570 games, Feller pitched 3,827 innings and posted a win\u2013loss record of 266\u2013162, with 279 complete games, 44 shutouts, and a 3.25 earned run average (ERA).  His career 2,581 strikeouts were third all-time upon his retirement. A prodigy who bypassed baseball's minor leagues, Feller made his debut with the Indians at the age of 17. His career was interrupted by four years of military service (1942\u20131945) as a United States Navy Chief Petty Officer aboard  during World War II. Feller became the first pitcher to win 24 games in a season before the age of 21. He threw no-hitters in 1940, 1946, and 1951, and 12 one-hitters, both records at his retirement. He helped the Indians win a World Series title in 1948 and an American League-record 111 wins and the pennant in 1954. Feller led the American League in wins six times and in strikeouts seven times. In 1946 he recorded 348 strikeouts, the most since 1904 and then believed to be a record. An eight-time All-Star, Feller was ranked 36th on Sporting Newss list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and was named the publication's \"greatest pitcher of his time\". He was a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. Baseball Hall of Fame member Ted Williams called Feller \"the fastest and best pitcher I ever saw during my career.\" Hall of Famer Stan Musial believed he was \"probably the greatest pitcher of our era.\" He was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 on his first ballot with the then fourth highest percentage of votes. He was elected the inaugural President of the Major League Baseball Players' Association and both organized and participated in barnstorm exhibition games which featured players from both the Major and Negro leagues. Feller died at the age of 92 in 2010."

His catcher during this period was Nile Kinnick, who later won the Heisman Trophy in 1939 and became a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. A student at Van Meter High School, Feller was a starting pitcher for the school's baseball team. During this time, he continued to play on the Farmers Union team in the American Amateur Baseball Congress, and had 19 wins and four losses for Farmers Union one season. He also was the starting center for the high school basketball team. By the age of 16, Feller possessed what critics judged a high quality fastball; major league scouts traveled to Dayton, Ohio to watch him in the annual national baseball tournament. After the game, several big league clubs offered signing bonuses with their contract offers, but he had already been signed to a professional contract with the Cleveland Indians."

        "content": "In 1936, Feller was signed by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While scouting Feller, Slapnicka said, \"This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that he was smart and had the heart of a lion, but I knew that I was looking at an arm the likes of which you see only once in a lifetime.\" Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester. Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games, without either playing for a farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine, . Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, \"For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 [] worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity.\" Feller joined the Indians and made his Major League debut on July 19, 1936, in a relief appearance against the Washington Senators. A month later on August 23, Feller made his first career start against the St. Louis Browns. Indians manager Steve O'Neill had Denny Galehouse warmed up in the bullpen in case the 17-year-old Feller had early troubles, but he struck out all three batters he faced in the first inning, and recorded 15 strikeouts in earning his first career win. His strikeout total was the highest for a (starting) pitching debut. Three weeks later, he struck out 17 batters, tying a single-game strikeout record previously set by Dizzy Dean, in a win over the Philadelphia Athletics. He finished the season with a 5\u20133 record, having appeared in 14 games; he had 47 walks and 76 strikeouts in 62 innings. Feller's fame reached such a level that when he returned to Van Meter for his senior year of high school, the governor of Iowa greeted him. His record-setting rookie year made him, according to baseball writer Richard Goldstein, \"the best-known young person in America, with the possible exception of Shirley Temple.\" Feller's entrance to the big leagues was later described: As the 1937 season began, Feller appeared on the cover of the April 19, 1937 issue of Time magazine. In his first appearance of the season on April 24, Feller suffered an injury to his elbow while throwing a curveball. He spent April and May healing the arm, and in May graduated from high school; the ceremony aired nationally on NBC Radio. In mid-May, the Indians considered ending Feller's season early. \"We're not taking any chances on that arm and we're not going to allow him to pitch again until the last trace of soreness has disappeared\", said Slapnicka. On May 18, Feller appeared in his first game since April 24 but did not record an out. He did not pitch again until June 22, when he recorded two innings, then returned to normal pitching duties on July 4. On October 2, 1938, Feller was the starting pitcher of a season-ending double-header against the Detroit Tigers. Detroit's Hank Greenberg was two home runs short of Babe Ruth's then-single-season record of 60 home runs. By the ninth inning, Feller had recorded 16 strikeouts, one fewer than the MLB record in a nine-inning game. He tied the record when he struck out Detroit's Pete Fox and, when he struck out Chet Laabs for the fifth time that day, broke the record, to set the modern major league record of 18. Greenberg went 1\u20134 with a double, then 3\u20133 in the nightcap, all singles.  He later said of the game, \"Feller's curve was jumping wickedly and with that and his fast ball, he was murder.\" Feller did not earn a win, however, as the Indians lost, 4\u20131. \"It was one of those days when everything feels perfect, your arm, your coordination, your concentration, everything. There was drama in the air because of Greenberg's attempt to break Ruth's record, and the excitement grew even greater when my strikeouts started to add up\", Feller said. For the 1938 season, Feller led all pitchers with 208 walks and 240 strikeouts. In 1939, Feller received his first career Opening Day start, against the Tigers, after a match against the Browns was rained out. He won the game 5\u20131, allowing three hits. On Mother's Day, Feller pitched against the Chicago White Sox with his family in attendance. One pitch was fouled off by Marv Owen into the seats and into the face of Feller's mother; he went on to win the game. Feller finished the 1939 season leading the AL in wins (24), complete games (24) and innings pitched (296.2), and led the majors for a second consecutive year in both walks (142) and strikeouts (246). Opening Day of the 1940 season featured a no-hitter from Feller against the Chicago White Sox. Feller was assisted by Indians second baseman Ray Mack when he made a diving play to record the final out. This is the only no-hitter to be thrown on Opening Day in major league history. However, he followed his no-hitter with a six-run, three-inning performance in his next start, in a game against the Detroit Tigers. By the end of the season, he had a 27\u201311 record, with his win total the best in the majors that season, and a career-high for Feller. He accomplished the pitching triple crown for the 1940 season, as he led the AL in ERA (2.61), wins (27) and strikeouts (261) (the latter two led the entire majors). Feller also led the majors with 31 complete games and 320.1 innings pitched, and won the Sporting News Player of the Year Award. Feller later assessed his first few years in the majors: \"I relied on the catcher too much. It's swell to have a good catcher calling 'em for you, but the pitcher should take responsibility on his own shoulders.\" To publicize Feller's extraordinary pitching speed, the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball commissioned sports film analysis pioneer and former major leaguer Lew Fonseca to pit Feller's fastball against a motorcycle in a \"100 mph\" speed trial. The test was conducted in Chicago's Lincoln Park, with Feller in street shoes, suit pants, dress shirt, and tie, pitching without a mound on an asphalt roadway.  He was required to hit a target  in diameter from  away, \"as control is as important as speed\". The still accelerating Harley-Davidson passed Feller going , yet even with a generous head start the ball beat the bike to the target by several feet. Feller's throw was calculated at the time to have reached 98.6\u00a0mph (158.7\u00a0km/h), later raised  to 104\u00a0mph (167\u00a0km/h) using updated measuring methods. Feller again led the majors in wins (25), strikeouts (260), innings pitched (343), and walks (194) for the 1941 season. His six shutouts were an AL-best on the season. That year, Joe DiMaggio talked about Feller's pitching ability, stating \"I don't think anyone is ever going to throw a ball faster than he does. And his curveball isn't human.\" Feller appeared in the May 12, 1941, edition of Life, which said: \"...\u00a0he is unquestionably the idol of several generations of Americans, ranging in age from 7 to 70. They represent every city, town and village in the land, speak of him familiarly as 'Bob', and talk about him by the hour, with enthusiasm.\""

Feller heard about the bombing while returning from a visit to his terminally ill father at Des Moines to Chicago where he was to sign a new Indians contract. Two days later, he volunteered for the United States Navy, becoming the first American professional athlete to enlist. Originally he tried to enlist as a fighter pilot but failed hearing tests. Feller attended basic training at Norfolk Naval Base and served as a physical fitness instructor there. He also pitched in baseball games hosted by the military. Although he had received a military exemption owing to his father's failing health, he wanted to serve in combat missions. Feller said, \"I told them I wanted to\u00a0... get into combat; wanted to do something besides standing around handing out balls and bats and making ball fields out of coral reefs.\" Feller was assigned to ; he had hoped to serve on , but it would not be commissioned for another six months after Alabama, joining the fleet February 22, 1943. Shortly before Feller left for combat, his father died of brain cancer in early January 1943. Five days later, he married Virginia Winther, whom he had met while in Florida for spring training; she was a student at Rollins College. After the marriage, Feller returned to service as Gun Captain aboard Alabama and kept his pitching arm in shape by throwing near a gun turret. Feller and the Alabama crew spent most of 1943 in the British Isles along with , but in August were reassigned to the Pacific Theater of Operations. Feller's first taste of direct combat was at Operation Galvanic in November 1943. Alabama also served during Operation Flintlock while primarily being used as an escort battleship in 1944. Feller participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea before his combat duty ended in January 1945; he spent the rest of the war at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station as an instructor. When the war ended, Feller was discharged as a Chief Petty Officer on August 22, 1945. He was decorated with six campaign ribbons and eight battle stars while serving on missions in both the Pacific and North Atlantic, and was made an honorary member of the Green Berets later in life."

        "content": "Upon arrival in Cleveland after his discharge, Feller was honored with a civic luncheon on August 24, 1945, at the Carter Hotel. Feller said to the thousand-plus crowd: \"The real heroes didn't come home.\" Later that day, the city held a parade and Feller was the starting pitcher in the Indians' game against the Detroit Tigers. Feller allowed four hits in the game and earned a win in the Indians' 4\u20132 victory. \"I was so tired from all the receptions I didn't know if I could finish the game\", Feller said. For the 1945 season, he appeared in nine games and notched a 5\u20133 record with 59 strikeouts and 2.50\u00a0ERA. Before the 1946 season, Feller signed a $37,500 () contract for that year, including a bonus for attendance, as the Indians felt many were attending baseball games primarily to see him; he was offered $100,000 by Jorge Pasquel to play in the Mexican League, but declined to leave the States again. Feller recorded his second career no-hitter on April 30, 1946, against the New York Yankees. He allowed five walks and struck out 11 Yankees. Feller said of the game, \"The no-hitter on opening day in Chicago is the one that gets all the attention. But my no-hitter at Yankee Stadium was against a much better team than the White Sox. There was no comparison. I had to pitch to Tommy Henrich, Charlie Keller and Joe DiMaggio in the ninth inning to get the Yankees out.\" At one point during the season (as he thought he might be nearing Rube Waddell's AL record for strikeouts of 344), Feller claims he confirmed Waddell's total with the AL office. In his last appearance of the season he fanned five Detroit Tigers on September 29 to set what was then believed to be the then-AL single-season strikeout record of 348. Later research into box scores for Waddell's 1904 pitching appearances credited him with five additional strikeouts, moving the mark to 349 and bumping Feller from the top spot.  Feller's tally proved the highest for 62 years, until passed by Sandy Koufax's then record 382 in 1966. During the 1946 season Feller registered career-highs in strikeouts (348), games started (42), games pitched (48), shutouts (10), complete games (36), and innings pitched (377.1)\u2013\u2013 all major league bests that season. Feller finished 26\u201315 with an ERA of 2.18, the latter a career-low. Nearly 20 years later, Feller recalled, \"For the 1946 season, though, the Indians were so thin in pitching that [player-manager] Boudreau decided I was to pitch every fourth day, regardless of rainouts, open dates, or anything else.\" Feller began 1947 by setting up a barnstorming tour, pitting his own selected team against a Negro league baseball team led by Satchel Paige. Feller's team included Stan Musial and Phil Rizzuto, while Paige's included Buck O'Neil and Hilton Smith. They played in 22 games across the United States, and at the conclusion of the tour, each player had made nearly as much money as the St. Louis Cardinals made as a team for their 1946 World Series win. Against the St. Louis Browns, in Feller's second start of the season, he extended his major league record for one-hitters when he recorded his ninth one-hit game in a shutout win on April 22. In a June 13 game against the Philadelphia Athletics, having already amassed 10 strikeouts through four innings, Feller fell from the mound, which rain had made slippery, and injured his back. \"My fastball was never the same after that\", Feller said. He ended the season as the AL leader in wins (20) and shutouts (5), and led the majors in strikeouts (196) and innings pitched (299)."

        "content": "In 1948, the Indians had one of their finest seasons, though Feller experienced a season that had a considerable number of downs as well as ups. Feller was selected to represent the AL All-Stars for the seventh time in his career in the 1948 All-Star Game, but declined to play, feeling that his performance did not warrant selection as an All-Star. At one point he was winless for a month, and by July 22, his record was 9\u201312. Lou Boudreau, the Indians' player-manager, declared \"we sink or swim with Feller\", and continued to pick him. Feller proceeded to go 10\u20133 for the remainder of his appearances to finish the season with a record of 19\u201315, a league-leading 164 strikeouts, and a 3.56\u00a0ERA. The Indians won a one-game playoff against the Boston Red Sox to determine the team to represent the AL in the World Series; it was the first time the team had won the pennant since the 1920 season. Reportedly, Feller was involved in a scheme devised by him and Bob Lemon to help relay signs to Indian batters that involved a telescope mounted on a tripod (which Feller brought from the war) that was hidden on the scoreboard of Municipal Stadium. Feller started Game One of the 1948 World Series against the NL-champion Boston Braves. In the eighth inning, Feller and Boudreau appeared to have picked off the Braves' Phil Masi as he attempted to steal a base, but umpire Bill Stewart ruled he was safe. Masi scored the only run of the game on a Braves single. Despite surrendering just two hits on 85 pitches for the game, Feller and the Indians lost 1\u20130. Later, photographs showed that Boudreau had tagged Masi out by two feet. Feller said, \"Stewart was the only guy in the park who thought he was safe.\" Feller was again named the starter in Game Five, which set an attendance record; the 86,288 fans at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland was the then-largest attendance at a baseball game. The Braves put up three runs in the top of the first inning. The Indians came back to tie the game, but by the seventh inning, the Braves regained the lead for good and Feller was removed from the game. He finished having allowed eight hits and seven earned runs. Lemon won Game Six and gave the Indians their second World Series championship. After the Indians returned to Cleveland and were given a victory parade, Feller said, \"This is as good as being President.\""

        "content": "After taking a pay cut to start the 1949 season, Feller pitched on Opening Day against the St. Louis Browns. During the game, he injured his shoulder and missed the rest of April. His performances were mixed during the rest of the season, and he finished the year with a 15\u201314 record and a 3.75 ERA. Before the 1950 season, Feller suggested to Indians management he take a pay cut, and did so. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg said, \"He himself made the suggestion. In fact, he offered to take more than the 25 per cent maximum pay cut allowed. There was absolutely nothing to it. We all agreed quickly on the figure after Bob showed up yesterday.\" In a win over the Detroit Tigers in the second game of a doubleheader, Feller became the 53rd pitcher to win 200 games. Throughout the year, players noted that his velocity had returned, and, winning games with finesse rather than power, he was again effective. He finished the year with 16 wins and a 3.43 ERA. On July 1, 1951, Feller recorded his third career no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers. \"I was depending on my slider and I didn't begin to think of a no-hitter until about the seventh inning. I tried to keep it in the back of my mind, bearing down and concentrating on one hitter at a time\", Feller said. Feller was the third pitcher, after Larry Corcoran and Cy Young, to record three career no-hitters. He became the first pitcher of the 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout against the Washington Senators on August 21. Along with Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Feller reached the 20-win mark during the season; they were the first trio of pitchers on the same staff to earn 20 wins since 1931.  The Cleveland starting rotation was so strong that future Hall of Famer Bob Lemon's 17 wins was the only time in an eight-year stretch he didn't win 20. Feller went 22\u20138 in 1951, leading the AL both in wins and with a .733 win percentage.  He was named the Sporting News Pitcher of the Year. Feller started the 1952 season with three wins in his first five starts; one of the losses was an April 23 one-hitter against Bob Cain, who also allowed only one hit. Feller struggled for the rest of the season, and after an argument with an umpire over a strike call in late August, manager Al L\u00f3pez shut Feller down for the season, finishing 9\u201313 and a 4.74 ERA. He improved the following year, winning 10 games and losing 7 in 25 starts after Lopez gave him extra days of rest between appearances. The Indians won 111 regular-season games during 1954, breaking an AL record previously held by the 1927 New York Yankees. The 35-year-old Feller finished 13\u20133 on the year, earning his 250th pitching victory in a May 23 win and his 2,500th career strikeout in a win on June 12. The Indians played against the New York Giants in the 1954 World Series, getting swept in four games.  Unlike the 1948 Series, Feller did not make an appearance. Indians manager Al L\u00f3pez said of not starting Feller, \"I know Feller wanted to start one of the games in the 1954 World Series (when the Indians were swept by the New York Giants), though we never really talked about it ... If we had won the first or second game in New York, I was going to start Feller in Cleveland in the fourth game. But when we didn't (win either game in New York), why in the hell was I going to pitch Feller? He was the fifth starter on the club at that time, and wasn't the Feller he'd been (earlier in his career).\" In 1955, Feller spent part of the season as a starter, then was moved to the bullpen later in the season. He went 4\u20134 in 25 appearances. During the off-season, he became chairman of the Ohio March of Dimes and served as player representative for the American League. He worked with National League representative Robin Roberts throughout the off-season, discussing the possibility of player arbitration and pensions with baseball owners; he then became president of the Major League Baseball Players' Association. In the 1956 season, Feller started four games and appeared in 15 others, and finished with an 0\u20134 record and career-worst 4.97\u00a0ERA. The Indians held \"Bob Feller Night\" on September 9, and he appeared in his last major league game on September 30. After the season, speculation mounted regarding whether Feller would retire as a player. In December 1956, Feller told The Plain Dealer: \"I will return to Cleveland later this week and plan to confer with Hank Greenberg before Christmas. I hope to reach a decision at that time.\" Greenberg had also offered Feller his release or a job with the Indians in their front office. Greenberg said, \"We sincerely want Feller to remain with us. As far as I'm concerned, there will always be a job waiting for Bob in the Cleveland organization.\" On December 28, Feller officially retired from the Indians as a player to continue his work selling insurance. Announcing his retirement, Feller said, \"I could have gone with a couple other ball clubs, but anything I might have done with them would have taken the edge off the success I have had with the Cleveland club the last 20 years.\" He continued, \"What if I did pitch another year, so what? I would have to come to the decision I am making now, some time.\" He spent his entire career of 18 seasons with the Indians, being one of \"The Big Four\" in the Indians' pitching rotation in the 1950s, along with Bob Lemon, Early Wynn and Mike Garcia. Feller shares the Major League record of 12 one-hitters with Nolan Ryan, and was the first pitcher to win 20 or more games before the age of 21. He ended his career with 266 wins, 2,581 strikeouts and 279 complete games. Over the course of his career, he led the AL in strikeouts seven times and walks four times. Upon his retirement, Feller was number three all-time in strikeouts, behind only Walter Johnson and Cy Young, and held the major league record for most walks in a career (1,764), and holds the 20th-century record for most walks in a season (208 in 1938). The Indians retired his jersey number, 19, on December 27, 1956. As a hitter, Feller posted a .151 batting average (193-for-1282) with 99 runs, 28 doubles, 13 triples, 8 home runs, 99 RBI and 100 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .963 fielding percentage. In 1962, Feller was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, along with Jackie Robinson. Both were the first to be elected on their first ballot appearance since the original induction class of 1936. At the time of his induction, only Ty Cobb (98.2%), Babe Ruth (95.1%), and Honus Wagner (95.1%) had a higher percentage of ballot votes. In 2010, after Feller had been admitted to hospice, a reporter released a story recalling a 2007 interview with an aged Feller where he brought up Feller's candid \u2013 and accurate \u2013 assessment of Robinson as a ballplayer. \"They overhyped Jackie Robinson. He was a good baserunner. He was a fair hitter. He was an average second baseman. He was not as good a ballplayer as Larry Doby. There were a lot of better black ballplayers than Jackie Robinson,\" said Feller."

        "content": "Throughout his career, Feller played exhibition games during the off-season, playing in towns unaccustomed to seeing major league ballplayers. His exhibition tours often featured other big leaguers and Negro league players, like Satchel Paige, who was also a teammate of Feller's with the Indians. Other players included Stan Musial, Mickey Vernon, and Jeff Heath. During a barnstorming tour in 1945, Feller pitched against Jackie Robinson after he had been signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers. He told a reporter in Los Angeles that he believed Robinson was too muscle-bound to succeed against pitching in the major leagues, although Robinson recorded two hits off Feller. Players had to notify the Commissioner of Baseball, A.B. \"Happy\" Chandler, before participating in exhibition games and were not allowed to begin games before the conclusion of the major-league season. Feller wrote to Chandler, challenging the league's limit on the number of games that were allowed to be played and proposing an increase; the Commissioner agreed to Feller's proposal. To minimize travel time, Feller employed airplanes, such as two Douglas DC-3s in 1947, to transport players from town to town. Feller's involvement, as well as that of other major league players, was the subject of meetings between the Commissioner and AL and NL presidents. In 1947, Feller announced that he would pitch in the Cuban winter league during the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major-leaguer could play in Cuba. Feller said he would donate his profits from playing in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players' pension fund: \"I want to prove I'm not going to Cuba for any selfish interest but because there is a principle involved and that is the right of any ball player to work at his chosen profession\". Feller also believed it was \"grossly unfair\" that major leaguers who were U.S. citizens could not play in winter leagues but Latin Americans were permitted. Indians owner and president Bill Veeck said, \"I have no comment on Bob's outside activities. I don't know whether they've hurt him or not. But I do know this. The great majority of the people of Cleveland think they've hurt him.\" Feller's barnstorming business savvy and endorsement details made him one of the wealthiest players of his time but he claimed his off-season exhibitions and barnstorming were necessary to pay for increased medical expenses for his family. His first wife developed anemia after giving birth to their second child when she was given the wrong type of blood during transfusions; she subsequently became addicted to the prescribed medication for her condition. Feller was trying to make up lost earnings as a result, since he missed out on $125,000 or more in salary when he served in the Navy; he missed more than three major league seasons. Feller's biographer John Sickels suggested: \"They were trying to make money, but part of it was also, he felt that the black players weren't necessarily getting a fair chance and that he wanted to sort of showcase it. And seeing those, I think, those exhibition games helped people realize that the Negro league players were just as good as the Major League players.\""

        "content": "Feller, who averaged over 25 wins for the three seasons preceding his military service and won 26 his first year out, estimated that the nearly four years he missed while in the U.S. Navy cost him at least 100 career wins. Given his proven performance on both sides of his hitch it is likely that Feller would have finished his career with more than 350 wins and perhaps 3,800 strikeouts. The always plain-speaking Feller said, \"I know in my heart I would have ended up a lot closer to 400 than 300 if I hadn't spent four seasons in the Navy. But don't take that as a complaint. I'm happy I got home in one piece.\" There are numerous claims of how fast Feller could actually throw a ball.  All are inherently dubious (due to the extremely inaccurate means of measuring used), and none can be proven valid.  Best estimates are at least 98 mph and quite possibly several miles an hour over 100 mph.  Among them is footage of a Feller fastball being clocked by Army ordnance equipment (used to measure artillery shell velocity) and registering at . However, this took place in the later years of his career and the speed of the ball was measured as it crossed the plate (whereas later methods measure the speed as it leaves the pitcher's hand). With primitive equipment, Feller was at one point measured at . Feller once mentioned that he was clocked at  at Lincoln Park in Chicago. He also is credited with throwing the second fastest pitch ever officially recorded, at , in a game in 1946 at Griffith Stadium. Feller said a 1974 test involving Nolan Ryan would be evaluated when he threw the ball rather than when it reached home plate, and as columnist Milton Richman wrote, Feller said \"Sandy Koufax had the best live fast ball he ever saw.\" Although subjective, an extremely telling assessment of just how hard Feller was to hit \u2013 even for a left-handed hitter, who had an advantage compared to right-handers \u2013 was the tribute from Ted Williams, regarded by many as the greatest hitter in baseball history.  He confessed, \"Three days before he pitched I would start thinking about Robert Feller, Bob Feller. I'd sit in my room thinking about him all the time. God I loved it\u00a0... Allie Reynolds of the Yankees was tough, and I might think about him for 24 hours before a game, but Robert Feller: I'd think about him for three days.\" Feller was ranked 36th on Sporting News'''s list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and also the publication's \"greatest pitcher of his time\" as well as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. Each year, American Legion Baseball presents the \"Bob Feller Pitching Award\" to the pitcher \"with the most strikeouts in regional and national competition.\""

        "content": "Feller was elected the inaugural president of the Major League Baseball Players' Association in 1956. As president, he appeared before Congress to speak about baseball's reserve clause. Feller was the first player to get a franchise to agree to a share of game receipts when he was the starting pitcher for Indians' games. He was also the earliest player to incorporate himself (as Ro-Fel, Inc.). He was also one of the first players to work for the right of a player to enter free agency. Feller and his wife, Virginia Winther, had three sons, Steve, Martin, and Bruce. The couple divorced in 1971; from the divorce settlement, Virginia received the house she and Feller had built. Virginia died on May 6, 1981, in her home in Shaker Heights, Ohio. In retirement, Feller lived with his second wife, Anne Feller, in Gates Mills, a suburb of Cleveland. Feller is credited with being the first baseball star to sign autographs at baseball memorabilia conventions, and was such a frequent guest at such events that one ESPN writer speculated that he had signed more autographs than any other person. In 1990, Feller received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In June 2009, at the age of 90, Feller was one of the starting pitchers at the inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame Classic, which replaced the Hall of Fame Game at Cooperstown, New York. Feller was treated for leukemia in August 2010. By October, Feller was fitted with a pacemaker and was diagnosed with pneumonia and thrush, an infection of the mucous membrane lining the mouth and throat. He was transferred on December 8 from the Cleveland Clinic to hospice care. On December 15, Feller died of complications from leukemia at 92."

But, Bob transcended more than that era. In this day of free agency and switching teams, Bob Feller remained loyal to the city and the team for over 70 years. You will likely not see that kind of mutual loyalty and admiration ever again.\" In 2010, the \"Cleveland Indians Man of the Year Award\" was renamed the \"Bob Feller Man of the Year Award\". On Opening Day of the 2011 season, the Indians invited Feller's widow, Anne, to present a silent first pitch. During pregame introductions, Cleveland players wore a No. 19 jersey in honor of Feller. For the entire 2011 season the players' uniforms were outfitted with an outline of Feller's pitching motion. The organization also made a permanent memorial of the press-box seat that Feller used in later life. The Bob Feller Museum opened in Feller's birthplace, Van Meter, Iowa, on June 10, 1995. Designed by Feller's son Stephen, on land donated by Brenton Banks, the museum had two rooms that contained Feller memorabilia and items from his own collection. The Feller bat used by Babe Ruth when he made his last public appearance at Yankee Stadium is at the museum. Feller said a teammate had stolen the bat and eventually it was purchased by the Upper Deck sports card company for $107,000. Feller later offered the company $95,000 in return for the bat. Following Feller's death in 2010, the museum faced serious funding issues. In 2015, with family approval, the Bob Feller Museum was donated to the city of Van Meter for use as the city hall. Some artifacts remain on permanent exhibit and can be viewed free of charge. In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award was created to honor the life of Feller. The award recognizes \"individuals that possess the values, integrity, and dedication to serving our country that Bob Feller himself displayed.\""

Due to a farm-machinery accident in his youth (April 17, 1888), Brown lost parts of two fingers on his right hand, and in the process gained a colorful nickname. He turned this handicap into an advantage by learning how to grip a baseball in a way that resulted in an exceptional curveball (or knuckle curve), which broke radically before reaching the plate. With this technique he became one of the elite pitchers of his era. Brown was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1949."

        "content": "Brown was born in Nyesville, Indiana. He was also known as \"Miner\", having worked in western Indiana coal mines for a while before beginning his professional baseball career. Nicknames like \"Miner\" (or misspelled as \"Minor\") and \"Three Finger\" (or sometimes \"Three-Fingered\") were headline writers' inventions. To fans and friends he was probably best known as \"Brownie\". To his relatives and close friends, he was also known as \"Mort\". His three-part given name came from the names of his uncle, his father, and the United States Centennial year of his birth, respectively. According to his biography, he suffered two separate injuries to his right hand. The first and more famous trauma came when he was feeding material into the farm's feed chopper. He slipped and his hand was mangled by the knives, severing much of his index finger and damaging the others. A doctor repaired the rest of his hand as best he could. While it was still healing, the injury was further aggravated by a fall he took, which broke several finger bones. They were not reset properly, especially the middle finger (see photo). He learned to pitch, as many children did, by aiming rocks at knot-holes on the barn wall and other wooden surfaces. Over time, with constant practice, he developed great control. As a \"bonus\", the manner in which he had to grip the ball (see photo) resulted in an unusual amount of spin. This allowed him to throw an effective curve ball (or knuckle curve), and a deceptive fast ball and change-up. The extra topspin made it difficult for batters to connect solidly. In short, he \"threw ground balls\" and was exceptionally effective."

        "content": "Brown was a third baseman in semipro baseball in 1898 when his team's pitcher failed to appear for a game and Brown was put in to pitch. Players in the league quickly noticed the spin and movement created by Brown's unusual grip. Fred Massey, Brown's great-nephew, said, \"It didn't only curve, it curved and dropped at the same time\", Massey said. \"It made it extremely hard to hit and if you did hit it, you hit it into the ground [because you] couldn't get under it.\" After a spectacular minor league career commencing in Terre Haute of the Three-I League in 1901, Brown came to the majors rather late, at age 26, in 1903, and lasted until 1916 when he was close to 40. Brown's most productive period was when he played for the Chicago Cubs from 1904 through 1912. During this stretch, he won 20 or more games six times and was part of two World Series championships. New York Giants manager John McGraw regarded his own Christy Mathewson and Brown as the two best pitchers in the National League. In fact, Brown defeated Mathewson in competition as often as not, most significantly in the final regular season game of the 1908 season. Brown had a career 13\u201311 edge on Mathewson, with one no-decision in their 25 pitching matchups. Brown's most important single game effort was the pennant-deciding contest between the Cubs and the New York Giants on October 8, 1908, at New York. With Mathewson starting for the Giants, Cubs starter Jack Pfiester got off to a weak start and was quickly relieved by Brown, who held the Giants in check the rest of the way as the Cubs prevailed 4\u20132, to win the pennant. The Cubs then went on to win their second consecutive World Series championship, their last until 2016, a span of 108 years. In late 1909, Brown was on a team that played some games in Cuba. He planned to spend the winter there, but returned home when he caught a mysterious sickness. Brown saw limited action in 1912 and was released by the Cubs in October, a week before he turned 36. Soon after, he consulted a physician about a minor illness. Examining Brown's knee, the physician advised Brown to retire from baseball because he risked losing the use of his leg. However, Brown continued to play, signing with the Louisville Colonels, who traded him to the Cincinnati Reds for the 1913 season. After the 1913 season, Brown jumped to the Federal League, signing his contract on the same day as Joe Tinker. While Tinker went to the Chicago Whales, Brown was the player-manager for the St. Louis Terriers in 1914. Brown was dismissed as manager in August, then finished the season with the Brooklyn Tip-Tops, and was rumored to retire again in October 1914. He stayed in the league and played for the Chicago Whales in 1915. He returned to the Cubs for his final season in 1916. Brown and Mathewson wrapped their respective careers by squaring off on September 4, 1916, in the second game of a Labor Day doubleheader. The game was billed as the final meeting between the two old baseball warriors, and would turn out to be the final game in each of their careers. The game was a high-scoring one, the two teams combining for 33 hits. But with both teams well back in the pennant race, the two men pitched the entire game. Mathewson's Reds prevailed 10\u20138 over Brown's Cubs, as the Cubs' ninth-inning rally fell short. Brown finished his major league career with a 239\u2013130 record, 1375 strikeouts, and a 2.06 ERA, the third best ERA in Major League Baseball history amongst players inducted into the Hall of Fame, after Ed Walsh and Addie Joss.  His 2.06 ERA is the best in MLB history for any pitcher with more than 200 wins. Brown was a switch-hitter, which was and is unusual for a pitcher. He took some pride in his hitting, and had a fair batting average for a pitcher, compiling a career .206 batting average (235-for-1143) with 93 runs, 2 home runs and 73 RBI."

According to his biography, in an exhibition game against the famous House of David touring team in 1928, at the age of 51, he pitched three innings as a favor to the local team, and struck out all nine batters he faced. From 1920 to 1945, Brown ran a filling station in Terre Haute that also served as a town gathering place and an unofficial museum. He was also a frequent guest at Old-Timers' games in Chicago. In his later years, Brown was plagued by diabetes and then by the effects of a stroke. He died in 1948 of diabetic complications. He was posthumously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame the following year. F. Scott Fitzgerald refers to \"Three-finger Brown\" in his first novel, This Side of Paradise (1920). The television series The Simpsons made reference to Brown in the episodes \"The Last Traction Hero\" and \"Homer at the Bat\". Mr. Burns lists three ringers he wants for his company's softball team: Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, and Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown. Smithers has to point out that they are not only retired, but long-dead. He was referenced again in the episode \"The Last Traction Hero\" by Mr. Burns once more. In 1999, he was named as a finalist to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Between Brown and Antonio Alfonseca, the Cubs have featured both a \"three-fingered\" pitcher and a six-fingered pitcher on their all-time roster (Brown technically had four, including the thumb)."

He was originally signed as a free agent by the San Diego Padres in 1980. In December 1984, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox as part of an eight-player trade, with Tim Lollar, Bill Long and Luis Salazar in exchange for LaMarr Hoyt. In 1985, Guill\u00e9n was both the American League Rookie of the Year and The Sporting News Rookie of the Year, while also becoming just the third rookie shortstop in major league history to win a fielding title. He became known for his daring, aggressive style of play, as was demonstrated on August 2, 1985 in a game against the New York Yankees. With the game tied 5\u20135 in the 11th inning, Guill\u00e9n  hit a two-out single and, then proceeded to steal second base. When the next batter hit an infield single, Guill\u00e9n never hesitated as he rounded third base, catching the Yankees defense off guard and scored the game-winning run. In 1989, Guill\u00e9n was the victim of a hidden ball trick twice. First on June 23 when Greg Brock tagged him out when Guill\u00e9n, the runner at first base, took his lead, and then had to dive back to the base on a pick off throw from the pitcher.  Brock held the ball instead of throwing it back to the pitcher, and when Guill\u00e9n took his hand off the base to stand up, Brock tagged him out. On August 5, Dave Bergman made the same play, holding onto the ball following a pick off throw.  Guill\u00e9n again dove to the base to beat the throw, and when he took his hand off the base to stand up, Bergman tagged him on top of the batting helmet without looking at him. On April 21, 1992, Guill\u00e9n suffered a severe knee injury in a collision with outfielder Tim Raines. The injury caused him to miss almost the entire season, and subsequently diminished his defensive range as well as his stolen base output for the remainder of his career. Guill\u00e9n recovered in 1993 with his most productive season offensively, posting a .280 batting average, and career highs with 4 home runs and 50 runs batted in, as the White Sox won the American League Western Division title. He hit .273 and scored 4 runs in a losing effort, as the White Sox were defeated by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1993 American League Championship Series. In October 1997, after 13 seasons with the White Sox, Guill\u00e9n was granted free agency status and signed a contract to play for the Baltimore Orioles. In May 1998, the Orioles released him and he signed with the Atlanta Braves as a utility infielder. He helped the Braves win the 1999 National League Championship Series against the New York Mets with a 10th inning, pinch hit single in Game 6 of the series that tied the score at nine runs apiece, as the Braves went on to win the game and the series. The Braves would eventually lose to the New York Yankees in Guill\u00e9n's only World Series appearance as a player. After playing one year with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2000, he retired as a player at the end of the season at the age of 36."

Guill\u00e9n was an All-Star in 1988, 1990\u20131991, and won the Gold Glove Award in 1990. He led American League shortstops twice in range factor, once in assists and once in fielding percentage. Guill\u00e9n's .974 career fielding percentage ranks him 40th overall among major league shortstops, ahead of, among others, of both Luis Aparicio and Dave Concepcion. While he was considered one of the best fielding shortstops in the American League, Guill\u00e9n was often overlooked in post-season fielding awards because his playing career coincided with that of Tony Fernandez, Cal Ripken, Jr., and later Omar Vizquel. This trio would win every American League Gold Glove for a shortstop from 1986 until 2001, with the one exception being Guill\u00e9n's 1990 season award. Guill\u00e9n ranks among the White Sox all-time leaders in games played, hits, and at-bats.

In 2003 he was hired in the offseason to replace Jerry Manuel as the White Sox manager. He received a standing ovation from the crowd of 37,706 Chicagoans when introduced before his first game as a manager at U.S. Cellular Field on April 13, 2004.

Guillen has publicly stated that he feels the 2003 steroids list should be released to the public. Personal difficulties with White Sox General Manager Kenny Williams led to speculation dating back to October 2010 that the White Sox would allow Guill\u00e9n out of his contract to manage the Marlins. On September 26, 2011, an inability to get a contract extension worked out with the White Sox eventually led to his being released from his position, with the White Sox retaining the right to receive compensation should Guill\u00e9n manage in the 2012 season.

He later apologized for offending any LGBTQ people, but did not back down in his criticism of Mariotti. In 2010, he spoke against Arizona's new law to deal with illegal immigration. Guillen described illegal immigrants as \"workaholics.\" \"And this country can't survive without them,\" he said. \"There are a lot of people from this country who are lazy. We're not.

We're the ones who go out and work in the sun to make this country better.\" In August, Guillen said that Asian players were treated better than Latino players, stating that while it is common practice for major league clubs to provide a Japanese or Korean translator for their Asian born players, no such translator is provided for their Spanish-speaking Latin American ballplayers. On April 10, 2012, Guill\u00e9n was suspended for five games by the Marlins due to comments made about former Cuban president Fidel Castro. In a Time interview Guillen said, \"I love Fidel Castro ...

        "content": "Didier Claude Deschamps (; born 15 October 1968) is a French professional football manager and former player who has been manager of the France national team since 2012. He played as a defensive midfielder for several clubs, in France, Italy, England and Spain, namely Marseille, Juventus, Chelsea and Valencia, as well as Nantes and Bordeaux. Nicknamed \"the water-carrier\" () by former France teammate Eric Cantona, Deschamps was an intelligent and hard-working defensive midfielder who excelled at winning back possession and subsequently starting attacking plays, and also stood out for his leadership throughout his career. As a French international, he was capped on 103 occasions and took part at three UEFA European Football Championships and one FIFA World Cup, captaining his nation to victories in the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000. In addition to winning two Ligue 1 titles in 1990 and 1992, Deschamps was part of the Marseille squad that became the first, and so far only, French club to win the UEFA Champions League, a feat which the team achieved in 1993; with the Champions League victory, Deschamps became the youngest captain ever to lead his team to win the title. With Juventus he played three Champions League finals in a row between 1996 and 1998, winning the title in 1996. With the Turin side, he also won the UEFA Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup, as well as three Serie A titles, among other trophies. With Chelsea, he won the 1999\u20132000 FA Cup, and also reached another Champions League final with Valencia in 2001, before retiring later that season. After Franz Beckenbauer and followed by Iker Casillas, he was only the second captain in the history of football to have lifted the Champions League trophy, the World Cup trophy, and the European Championship trophy. As a manager, Deschamps began his career with Monaco, and helped the club to win the Coupe de la Ligue in 2003, and reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, being named Ligue 1 Manager of the Year in 2004. During the 2006\u201307 season, he helped his former club Juventus win the Serie B title and return to Serie A following their relegation due to their involvement in the 2006 Calciopoli Scandal the previous season. He subsequently managed another one of his former clubs, Marseille, where he won the Ligue 1 title during the 2009\u201310 season, as well as three consecutive Coupe de la Ligue titles between 2010 and 2012, and consecutive Troph\u00e9e des Champions titles in 2010 and 2011. On 8 July 2012, Deschamps was named as the new manager of the French national team. He led the team to the quarter-finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the final of UEFA Euro 2016, and victory in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the last of these making Deschamps the third man to win the World Cup as both a player and a manager. Alongside M\u00e1rio Zagallo and Franz Beckenbauer, Deschamps follows Beckenbauer as only the second to do so as captain."

After a short passage at rugby in the Biarritz Olympique club, Deschamps started his football career at an amateur club, Aviron Bayonnais whilst still at school. His potential was spotted by scouts from Nantes, for whom he signed in April 1983. Deschamps made his league debut on 27 September 1985. He transferred to Marseille in 1989. Deschamps then spent a season on loan with Bordeaux in 1990, before returning to Marseille. In this second spell with Marseille, Deschamps gained his first honours as a professional player, winning two French league titles in 1991 and 1992, and was a member of the first and only French side to win the Champions League in 1993, becoming the youngest captain ever to lift the trophy in the process. In 1994, Deschamps joined Italian club Juventus, with whom he won three Serie A titles, one Coppa Italia, two Italian Supercups, as well as his second Champions League title, an UEFA Super Cup, and an Intercontinental Cup in 1996; he also reached two more Champions League finals in his next two seasons, and an UEFA Cup final in 1995. After his spell with Juventus, Deschamps spent a season in England with Chelsea, winning the FA Cup, and scoring once against Hertha BSC in the Champions League. He finished his playing career in Spain, spending a season with Valencia, helping them to the 2001 UEFA Champions League Final, but he remained on the bench as they lost to Bayern Munich.

        "content": "Receiving his first international call-up from Michel Platini on 29 April 1989 against Yugoslavia, Deschamps started his international career in what was a dark time for the France national team as they failed to qualify for the World Cup in both 1990 and 1994, also suffering a first-round elimination at UEFA Euro 1992. When new team coach Aim\u00e9 Jacquet began to rebuild the team for Euro 96, he initially selected Manchester United star Eric Cantona as captain. After Cantona earned a year-long suspension in January 1995, the make-up of the team changed dramatically, with veterans Cantona, Jean-Pierre Papin, and David Ginola being dropped in favour of younger players such as Zinedine Zidane. Deschamps, as one of the few remaining veterans, was chosen to lead what would later be called the \"Golden Generation\". He first captained France in 1996 in a friendly match against Germany as a warmup for Euro 96. During that tournament, held in England, he led them all the way to the semi-finals, their best finish in an international tournament since the 1986 World Cup. In 1998, Deschamps captained France as they won the 1998 World Cup on home soil in Paris, holding an integral role in the team. Propelled by the momentum of this triumph, Deschamps also captained France as they won Euro 2000, giving them the distinction of being the first national team to hold both the World Cup and Euro titles since West Germany did so in 1974, a feat emulated and surpassed by the Spain national team between 2008 and 2012. Following the tournament, Deschamps announced his retirement from international football, making his second last appearance in a ceremonial match against a FIFA XI in August 2000, which resulted in 5\u20131 victory. His final appearance was against England. At the time of his retirement Deschamps held the record for the most appearances for France, though this has since been surpassed by Marcel Desailly, Zinedine Zidane and Lilian Thuram. In total, Deschamps earned 103 caps and scored four goals. Deschamps was named by Pel\u00e9 as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004."

Deschamps's ability to perform this role was made possible due to his high work-rate, tenacity, stamina, vision, reliable distribution and technique, and his efficacy at pressing and tackling opponents. He also had an excellent positional and organisational sense, and was known for his tactical intelligence, versatility, and his leadership as a footballer."

In his first season, he managed them to their first Ligue 1 title in 18 years. His success had seen the Marseille manager linked to a return to Juventus where former president Giovanni Cobolli Gigli urged the club to bring back Deschamps to replace Ciro Ferrara. Ferrara was eventually replaced by Alberto Zaccheroni. On 29 June 2010, Deschamps signed a contract extension that would keep him at Marseille until June 2012. On 6 June 2011, he extended his contract again, this time until June 2014. On 13 March 2012, his Marseille side progressed to the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since 1993 by beating Inter Milan.

The victory also ended a winless run of 12 matches in all competitions. Deschamps was delighted with Marseille's Coupe de la Ligue triumph and added: \"All title wins are beautiful, as they are difficult to achieve. This is the sixth in three years. For a club that had not won anything for 17 years, it is something to be proud of. The credit goes mostly to the players, but I also want to associate my staff with the victory. This is a great source of pride for me, even if it does not change the fact it has been a difficult season in Ligue 1.\" On 2 July 2012, Deschamps left the club by mutual agreement, citing their poor finish of 10th place in 2011\u201312."

        "content": "On 8 July 2012, Deschamps was appointed as head coach of the France national football team on a two-year contract, following in the footsteps of Laurent Blanc, who resigned after the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament. France was placed in UEFA Group I for the qualification phase of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. UEFA Group I contained the defending world champions Spain, plus Belarus, Finland and Georgia. In that group, France earned a 1\u20131 draw away in the first match against Spain but lost 1\u20130 at home against the same opponents in the second match. After the 1\u20130 defeat by Spain, France failed to score a single goal in its next four matches \u2013 against Uruguay (friendly, 1\u20130), Brazil (friendly, 3\u20130), Belgium (friendly, 0\u20130) and Georgia (Group I qualifying match, 0\u20130). France finished second in the group, three points behind Spain, and thus had to win the two-legged play-off tie against Ukraine to advance to the final phase of the tournament. In the first leg held in Kyiv, France was beaten 2\u20130 by Ukraine. Coming into the second leg, Ukraine had kept eight consecutive clean sheets and had not lost their last 12 matches. In the second leg held at the Stade de France, France beat Ukraine 3\u20130 to win the tie 3\u20132 on aggregate and became the first team to overturn a two-goal, first-leg deficit in a FIFA World Cup or UEFA European Championship qualification play-off. France thus qualified for the final phase of the FIFA World Cup for the fifth consecutive time. At the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, Deschamps's team advanced to the quarter-finals where they lost 1\u20130 to eventual champions Germany, and Paul Pogba was named Best Young Player of the tournament. On 20 November 2013, Deschamps extended his contract to coach the France national football team until the UEFA Euro 2016. The extension was triggered under the terms of an agreement reached with the French Football Federation (FFF) when Deschamps replaced Laurent Blanc after the UEFA Euro 2012, whereby qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup would earn Deschamps the right to lead France until the Euro 2016 to be held in France. At Euro 2016, Deschamps led France to the final on 7 July after a brace from Antoine Griezmann helped defeat Germany 2\u20130. In the final, France were defeated 1\u20130 after extra time by Portugal. On 31 October 2017, Deschamps signed a new contract until 2020. For the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Deschamps \"was careful in selecting his 23-man roster for Russia, selecting only players who he felt could gel as a cohesive unit\", resulting in the omission of Real Madrid\u2019s Karim Benzema. Although initially criticized for conservative tactics as the national team had indifferent showings to advance from the group stage with narrow wins over Australia and Peru and a draw against Denmark, they put in dominant performances during the knockout rounds, defeating Argentina 4\u20133 in the Round of 16 and Uruguay 2\u20130 in the quarter-finals to reach the semi-finals. During the tournament, Deschamps also deployed Blaise Matuidi \u2013 normally a holding midfielder \u2013 out of position, playing him out wide, rather than in the centre, as a left-sided winger or attacking midfielder in a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation. In this system, Matuidi proved to be equally effective, in spite of his unorthodox playing role, as he was able to track back and limit the attacking threat of the opposing full-backs on the flank. Moreover, he also often tucked into the centre, in order to help support Paul Pogba and N'Golo Kant\u00e9 defensively, which also helped minimise the amount of space given to the main playmakers of France's opponents throughout the tournament, and ultimately helped to nullify their impact on the game in midfield. Furthermore, Matuidi's more defensive role on the left flank provided balance within the team, as it in turn gave Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 the licence to attack and run at defences from the right wing. Following these matches, France became World Cup winners after beating Belgium 1\u20130 in the semi-final and Croatia 4\u20132 in the final. As such, Deschamps became only the third man after M\u00e1rio Zagallo and Franz Beckenbauer to win the World Cup as both a player and a manager, and only the second captain after Beckenbauer to do so. In December 2019, Deschamps signed a new contract with France, keeping him with the national team until World Cup 2022. At the Euros 2020 France were knocked out on penalities by Switzerland in the round of 16, following a 3\u20133 draw. Deschamps was criticized for getting his team selections and tactics wrong."

He played football as a linebacker for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL) from 1965 to 1973. Through those nine seasons he was invited to eight Pro Bowls, named a first-team All-Pro six times, and was twice recognized by his peers as the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year. Renowned as a fierce tackler and for the relentless effort with which he played, Butkus is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most intimidating linebackers in pro football history. Born in Chicago, Illinois, Butkus played his entire football career in his home state, which began at Chicago Vocational High School. As a college football player at the University of Illinois, he was a linebacker and center for the Fighting Illini. A two-time consensus All-American, he led the Illini to a Rose Bowl victory in 1963 and was deemed the most valuable player in the Big Ten Conference, and in 1964 he was named college football's Lineman of the Year by United Press International (UPI). He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. Butkus was drafted by the Bears as the third overall pick in the 1965 NFL Draft. He soon established himself as a ball hawk with his penchant for forcing turnovers. In his NFL career, he intercepted 22 passes, recovered 27 fumbles (a record when he retired), and was responsible for causing many more fumbles with his jarring tackles. His tackling ability earned him both admiration and trepidation from opposing players. According to Hall of Fame defensive end Deacon Jones, Butkus \"was a well-conditioned animal, and every time he hit you, he tried to put you in the cemetery, not the hospital.\" In 2009, the NFL Network named Butkus the most feared tackler of all time. Butkus is credited with having defined the middle linebacker position, and is still viewed as the \"gold standard by which other middle linebackers are measured.\" He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979, and his No. 51 jersey is retired by the Bears. Following his playing career, Butkus began careers in acting, sports commentary, and celebrity endorsement. He is active in philanthropy through the Butkus Foundation, which manages various charitable causes."

His mother, Emma, worked 50 hours a week at a laundry. Butkus grew up in the Roseland neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. He was a fan of the NFL's Chicago Cardinals and attended their games at Comiskey Park. His older brother Ron played football for three colleges and tried out for the Cardinals before quitting due to a bad knee. For four years starting at age 15, Butkus worked with his four brothers as a mover. Butkus played high school football as a fullback, linebacker, punter, and placekicker for coach Bernie O'Brien at Chicago Vocational High School. He averaged five yards per carry as a fullback, but preferred playing linebacker, where he made 70 percent of his team's tackles. In Butkus' first year on the varsity team, Chicago Vocational surrendered only 55 points in eight games. In 1959, he was the first junior to be honored by the Chicago Sun-Times as Chicago's high school player of the year. Injuries limited his play as a senior, but he was still heavily recruited by colleges to play football."

Butkus was named the team's most valuable player for the season, and was awarded the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the Big Ten's most valuable player. He was a unanimous choice as a center for the 1963 College Football All-America Team, earning first-team honors from all seven major selectors. As a senior in 1964, Butkus was named the team's co-captain along with safety George Donnelly. UPI deemed Butkus college football's Lineman of the Year for 1964, and he was named the player of the year by the American Football Coaches Association and The Sporting News. For the second consecutive season he was deemed the Illini's most valuable player. He was chosen for the 1964 All-America team by five of the six major selectors. In a cover story for Sports Illustrated that season, sportswriter Dan Jenkins remarked, \"If every college football team had a linebacker like Dick Butkus of Illinois, all fullbacks soon would be three feet tall and sing soprano.\" Butkus also finished sixth in Heisman Trophy balloting in 1963 and third in 1964, rare results both for a lineman and a defensive player. According to statistics kept by the university, he completed his college career with 374 tackles: 97 in 1962, 145 in 1963, and 132 in 1964."

After several days of recruiting by both the teams and leagues, his decision to sign with the Bears was viewed as a major victory for the NFL. Although the Bears offered him less money than the Broncos, playing for his hometown team and coach George Halas was more enticing. His rookie contract was worth $200,000. Along with fellow future Hall of Famer Gale Sayers, Butkus was one of three first-round picks for the Bears in the 1965 NFL Draft. The pick they used for Butkus had been acquired in a trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers."

        "content": "Succeeding Hall of Famer Bill George at middle linebacker, Butkus made an immediate impact as a rookie. He established himself as a ball hawk by intercepting five passes and recovering six opponents' fumbles, and he was also credited unofficially with having forced six fumbles. Against the New York Giants on November 28, he intercepted a pass and recovered a fumble, and was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Week by the AP for the first of four times in his career. He finished third in balloting for the AP's rookie of the year award, behind Sayers and Ken Willard of the San Francisco 49ers, with AP sportswriter Jack Hand remarking that Butkus would have certainly won if there was a separate award for defenders. He was named a first-team All-Pro by the AP and was invited to his first of eight straight Pro Bowls. In 1966, Butkus was named the second-team middle linebacker on the All-Pro teams of the AP, UPI, Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), and New York Daily News, with each selector placing him behind Ray Nitschke of the Green Bay Packers. He reclaimed the first-team spot on the UPI and NEA teams in 1967, the AP team in 1968, and the Daily News team in 1969, all of which he occupied through the 1970 season. Butkus scored the first points of his career on November 9, 1969, when he tackled Steelers quarterback Dick Shiner in the end zone for a safety. He also recorded 25 tackles in the game, and for his efforts was recognized as the NFL Defensive Player of the Week by the AP. That 38\u20137 win for the Bears was their only one of the season; they finished with a 1\u201313 record, which was the worst in franchise history. Additionally, Butkus' five-year contract had reached its end. A number of Bears players, including Butkus, expressed interest in being traded or cut by the team, but he signed a multi-year contract extension prior to the 1970 season to remain in Chicago. The contract raised his salary from $50,000 per year to around $80,000 to $100,000 per year. Despite the ineptitude of the Bears as a team, Butkus developed a reputation around the league as one of its best players. In both 1969 and 1970, he was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year by the NEA, which was voted on by NFL players. He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated in September 1970 with the caption, \"The Most Feared Man in the Game\". A panel of NFL coaches that year named Butkus the player they would most prefer to start a team with if they were building one from the ground up."

        "content": "Prior to the 1971 season, Butkus underwent preventive surgery on his right knee; he had torn ligaments in high school, but was able to continue playing due to strong muscles compensating for the injury. In 1971, he recorded 117 tackles and four interceptions, leading the Bears in both statistics. He also scored a point; in the closing minutes of a game against the Washington Redskins on November 14, the score was tied at 15 and the Bears had lined up to kick an extra point. The snap went over the head of holder Bobby Douglass, who then raced back to retrieve the ball and looked to pass it. Butkus, who was playing as a blocking back, ran into the end zone and leapt to receive the pass for the winning score. Butkus later called the play his favorite of his career. Despite the statistical output, for the first time since 1966 Butkus was not named to a major All-Pro first team, instead earning second-team honors from the NEA and Pro Football Writers Association. Butkus sparked controversy in 1972 with the release of Stop-Action, a memoir describing the final week of the 1971 season. The Bears had lost their final five games in 1971, and Butkus used the memoir as an outlet for his frustrations and grievances. In particular, he harshly criticized the Detroit Lions organization, saying, \"I think they are a lot of jerks, from the owner, the general manager, the coach on down... If we were voting for a jerk team or organization they'd have my vote all the way.\" The Lions responded with a 38\u201324 win over the Bears in Week 3 of 1972. After the game Lions linebacker Mike Lucci, whom Butkus had labeled a \"crybaby\", denied that the book had any bearing on the game's outcome, but told reporters, \"Butkus should just keep his mouth shut and play football.\" Butkus, who was notoriously surly with reporters, also denied any connection and accused the media of sensationalism. Bears teammate Gale Sayers later said he did not like the book, feeling Butkus was above such name-calling. The season as a whole was another productive one for Butkus, who reclaimed the first-team middle linebacker spot on the major All-Pro teams and was invited to his final Pro Bowl. Early in the first quarter against the Oilers in 1973, Butkus pounced on a fumble in the end zone for the only touchdown of his career. Houston tight end Mack Alston accused Butkus of intimidating the officials, saying he \"grabbed the ball and started yelling 'touchdown, touchdown, after which \"the officials looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders and called it a touchdown.\" His season was cut short after nine games by a lingering right knee injury, which he had been playing through for years, but was further aggravated after it gave out in Week 5 against the Atlanta Falcons. Prior to the 1974 season an orthopedic surgeon told him, \"I don't know how a man in your shape can play football or why you would even want to.\" The injury ultimately forced him to retire in May 1974 at age 31."

The contract also promised necessary medical and hospital care which, according to Butkus, the Bears neglected to provide him, causing irreparable damage to his knee. The Bears then told him he would not be paid if he could not play. Butkus filed suit against the Bears' team doctor in May 1974 asking for $600,000 in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages. It was eventually settled out of court when the Bears agreed to pay Butkus the full value of his contract. The episode caused a rift between Butkus and Bears owner George Halas, and the two did not speak for the next five years."

        "content": "Standing  tall and weighing , Butkus was an exceptionally large linebacker during his era. This size was a common trait in his family, as all four of his brothers and his father each stood over six feet tall and weighed over 200 pounds. He was also diligent with his conditioning. In high school he would push a car up and down a street to strengthen his legs, and in college he developed a routine of running at trees and dodging them to emulate avoiding blockers. Despite his size, he also had the speed and agility to make tackles from sideline to sideline and cover tight ends and running backs on pass plays. Hall of Famer Bill George, whom Butkus succeeded as the Bears' middle linebacker, said, \"The first time I saw Butkus, I started packing my gear. I knew my Bear days were numbered. There was no way that guy wasn't going to be great.\" At one point, Butkus gained a reputation as one of the best players on an otherwise bad Bears team in the late 1960s; during his tenure, the Bears won 48 games, lost 74, and tied 4. Consistently cited as one of football's meanest, toughest, and most feared players, Butkus was renowned for his intimidating profile and style of play. He was known to snarl at the opposition prior to plays. Quarterbacks would complain of Butkus biting them in pileups. Lions tight end Charlie Sanders recalled Butkus poking him in the eyes with his fingers through his face mask. He once intercepted a pass from Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton near the goal line, and instead of taking the ball into the end zone for an easy touchdown, he took aim at Tarkenton to run him over. When asked by a reporter if he was mean as the rumors suggested, Butkus replied, \"I wouldn't ever go out to hurt anybody deliberately. Unless it was, you know, important\u2014like a league game or something.\" He played angry, often \"manufacturing\" things to make him mad, because he felt it gave him a competitive edge. After the Bears lost to the Lions in their first matchup of 1969, Lions rookie running back Altie Taylor told reporters that Butkus was overrated. The next time the teams played that season, Butkus responded by chasing Taylor out of bounds after a play and causing him to jump into the stands at Wrigley Field. Butkus became most noted for his tackling ability, and the ferocity with which he tackled opponents. He was named the most feared tackler of all time by the NFL Network in 2009. Once during practice, he hit a metal football sled so hard that he crumpled it and left a piece of it dangling off. \"Tackling wasn't good enough,\" recalled former Bears defensive end Ed O'Bradovich. \"Just to hit people wasn't good enough. He loved to crush people.\" Butkus is credited with 1,020 tackles in his NFL career. Butkus recovered 27 fumbles in his career, an NFL record at the time of his retirement. One of his greatest strengths was his ability to rip the ball from a ball carrier's hands. Although not an official statistic at the time, it has been noted that Butkus would certainly be one of the all-time leaders in forced fumbles."

He is also recognized for having set the benchmark for the success of Bears middle linebackers, which continued with Mike Singletary and Brian Urlacher. Hall of Fame running back Earl Campbell, known for his hard-hitting running style, cited Butkus as his hero growing up. After his university years, Butkus continued to receive recognition for his college career. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. His No. 50 jersey is one of only two retired by the Illinois Fighting Illini football program, the other being the No. 77 of Red Grange, and he was an inaugural inductee into the Illinois Athletics Hall of Fame in 2016. Butkus was named to the Walter Camp Football Foundation's All-Century Team in 1999, compiled to honor the best college players of the 20th century. In November 2017, Illinois announced it would erect a statue of Butkus on campus to overlook a future football performance center. Butkus was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979, his first year of eligibility. The Hall's voters also named him to the NFL's 1960s All-Decade Team and 1970s All-Decade Team, deeming him one of the best players of both decades. On October 31, 1994, the Bears retired Butkus's No. 51 jersey along with Sayers's No. 40 jersey during a ceremony at Soldier Field. In 2004, a sculpture featuring Butkus, Halas, and seven other former Bears greats was unveiled at Soldier Field. Butkus has been repeatedly ranked among the top players in NFL history, being named the ninth-best player in NFL history by The Sporting News in 1999, the tenth-best by the NFL Network in its The Top 100: NFL's Greatest Players series in 2010, and the eight-best by the New York Daily News in 2014. In 2017, NFL senior analyst Gil Brandt ranked Butkus as the third greatest linebacker of all time, behind Derrick Thomas and Lawrence Taylor. He was also selected the 70th greatest athlete of the 20th century by ESPN. In 1994, he was named to the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team, compiled to recognize the best players of the NFL's first 75 years as adjudged by NFL officials and media personnel. In 2019, Butkus was named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Honoring his contributions to Chicago sports, Butkus was inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame in 2008. On August 24, 2013, he was inducted into the National Lithuanian American Hall of Fame. In 2018 Butkus was inducted as a laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln, the state's highest honor, by the Governor of Illinois. In 1985, the Downtown Athletic Club of Orlando, Florida created the Butkus Award, which is given annually to the most outstanding linebacker at the high school, college, and professional levels as chosen by a nationwide panel of 51 coaches and sportswriters. Butkus sued the Downtown Athletic Club for rights to the award in 2007, which it relinquished after a yearlong court battle. It has since been presented by the Butkus Foundation. As an homage, actor Sylvester Stallone named his pet Bullmastiff Butkus after the dog ate a security blanket. He decided to name him after \"possibly the fiercest football player in history\". The dog later starred alongside Stallone in the Rocky film series."

(1975), Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976), Gus (1976), Superdome (1978), Cracking Up (1983), Johnny Dangerously (1984), Hamburger: The Motion Picture (1986), The Stepford Children (1987), Spontaneous Combustion (1990), Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990), Necessary Roughness (1991) and Any Given Sunday (1999), and as a regular character on TV shows such as Blue Thunder, My Two Dads, Vega$, MacGyver, and Hang Time. He portrayed himself in both the critically acclaimed TV movie Brian's Song (1971) and the 2002 comedy Teddy Bears' Picnic. Butkus has also made cameo appearances in episodes of several television shows. Butkus endorsed Prestone, a brand of antifreeze, in a commercial during Super Bowl IV in 1970, stating the tagline, \"Because plugging holes is my business.\" The ad marked the first highly successful celebrity endorsement in Super Bowl advertising. Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, Butkus appeared alongside fellow former NFL star (and later Blue Thunder co-star) Bubba Smith in a series of ads for Miller Lite, which were released to high acclaim. In 1985, he was a pitchman for Echo Tools, a producer of outdoor power equipment. In the 1990s, Butkus promoted the \"Qwik-Cook Grill\", a grill utilizing newspaper as its main fuel. Butkus returned to the Bears as a color analyst on radio broadcasts in 1985, teaming with first-year play-by-play man Wayne Larrivee and former St. Louis Cardinals quarterback Jim Hart. He was hired as the replacement for Jimmy \"The Greek\" Snyder on CBS's pregame show The NFL Today in 1988, serving as an analyst through 1989. He was named as head coach of the XFL's Chicago Enforcers franchise, but was replaced by coach Ron Meyer for the league's only season in 2001. Instead, Butkus served as the league's director of competition and, during the second half of the season, a color commentator for the league's regional telecasts. In 2005, as part of the ESPN reality series Bound for Glory, Butkus served as head football coach of Montour High School in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. He coached the team to a 1\u20136 record before departing with two games remaining in the season, saying he had fulfilled his contract for the show."

Matt played college football for the USC Trojans as a defensive lineman, and joins his father in philanthropic activities. Butkus's nephew Luke Butkus has been an assistant coach in the NFL for the Bears, Seattle Seahawks, and Jacksonville Jaguars, he also coached for the University of Illinois, his alma mater, and as of 2019 is an assistant coach for the Green Bay Packers. Butkus's grandson Ian Parish plays volleyball for the UCLA Bruins. Injuries sustained during Butkus's playing career have compounded with time. He had his knee replaced with a metal unit. An osteotomy left him with one leg one-and-a-half inches shorter than the other, which has affected his hips, back, and neck. Around 2002, nerve damage in his spine caused him to develop foot drop. He lost strength in his hands until he needed them both to lift a coffee cup. Still, Butkus maintains that football had a largely positive impact on his life, and that its benefits should not be overlooked. In August 2001, Butkus underwent quintuple bypass surgery to remove blockages in his arteries. After the surgery, he co-authored a book titled The OC Cure For Heart Disease with Lawrence J.

Berg was, at the time, the youngest player ever to play in an SM-liiga game (has since been surpassed by Jesse Joensuu, who was 15 years old in his debut). Berg also spent time in Kiekko-67 of the Finnish first division for 12 games during the season, scoring 1 goal, 1 assist, 16 penalty minutes and a -8 rating. He also represented Finland in the European Junior Championships, scoring 6 points in 5 games. The next season, Berg spent time in TPS's B and A-junior teams, also dressing for 5 games in the men's team. He also played 20 games again for Kiekko-67, scoring 12 points. Berg was again named to the European Junior Championships roster, getting one assist in 5 games. Berg gained the attention of NHL scouts due to his large frame, heavy shot, physical play and good mobility. He was drafted 3rd overall by the Los Angeles Kings, behind fellow defencemen Bryan Berard and Wade Redden. Berg, a highly touted prospect, was described in The Hockey News' draft review issue by Kings' then GM Sam McMaster as \"Hitting like Scott Stevens and skating like Paul Coffey\". Berg moved to the NHL next season as an 18-year-old. Berg played most of his first NHL season with the Kings, but was sent to the team's IHL-affiliate Phoenix Roadrunners for 20 games. In 51 games for the Kings, Berg had no goals, 7 assists, 29 penalty minutes and a -13 rating. In 20 games for the Roadrunners, Berg had no goals, 3 assists, 18 penalty minutes and a -10 rating. Berg also played two playoff games for the Roadrunners, scoring no points. In his second NHL season, Berg again had difficulties staying on the Kings' lineup. He nonetheless raised his level of play, scoring his first two goals. He played 41 games for the Kings, scoring two goals and adding 6 assists, while getting 24 penalty minutes and a -9 rating. In 23 games for the Roadrunners, Berg had 1 goal, 3 assists, 21 penalty minutes and a -9 rating. During the season Berg also represented Finland in the World Junior Championships, having 2 assists in 8 games. In the 1997-98 season, Berg finally became an NHL regular, playing 72 games for the Kings, with no goals, 8 assists, 61 PIM and a +3 rating. Berg adopted the role of a defensive defenceman, despite high expectations of his offensive potential. The Kings made the playoffs, which saw Berg raise his game. The team's playoff run came out short, losing in the first round to the St. Louis Blues in four games. In those four games, Berg had no goals, 3 assists, no penalty minutes and a +3 rating. Berg also represented Finland in the 1998 Nagano Olympics, where he was an important defensive player in Finland's bronze medal team. Berg returned to his hometown team TPS for the next season, playing 48 games. He scored 8 goals, added 7 assists and had 137 penalty minutes and a +5 rating. The team, along with Berg, won the Finnish championship, but Berg was unable to play in the decisive game due to a dirty hit in another game, which he was suspended for. Berg was a part of the Finnish national team in the world championships, playing 12 games without points. Berg returned to the NHL for the next season, which turned out to be his best so far. In 70 games he had 3 goals, 13 assists, 45 penalty minutes and a -1 rating. The Kings again made the playoffs, where Berg only played 2 games without points. He was again part of the Finnish world championships-team. The 2000-01 season was again tough for Berg. After 47 games with the Kings where he had just 4 points, he was traded to Toronto on March 13, 2001 for Adam Mair and a 2nd round draft pick (later used to select Mike Cammalleri), as the Leafs wished for an injection of youth into a rapidly aging roster. In 12 games for Toronto, he scored 3 goals and had a -6 rating. In 11 playoff games, he had 2 assists. In his first full season with Toronto, Berg saw more ice time and was a solid fifth or sixth defenceman. In 81 games, Berg scored 1 goal, had 10 assists, 46 penalty minutes and a career-high +14 rating. The team also had a successful playoff run, making it to the conference finals, where they were beaten in six games by the Carolina Hurricanes. In 20 playoff games, Berg had one assist. Berg played in Toronto for 3 more seasons, after retiring from the NHL due to family reasons. During the 2004-2005 NHL lockout, Berg played for Timr\u00e5 of the Swedish Elite League. He was the team's top all-around defenceman, scoring 20 points in 46 games and having a +11 rating. After retiring from the NHL, Berg signed with his hometown club TPS. Berg was the team captain and top defenceman for 3 seasons, but was heavily ridden with injuries in his last two seasons. After playing just ten games in 2010\u20132011, he announced his retirement from professional hockey on his birthday on July 28, 2011. Berg finished his NHL career with 606 regular season games played, 15 goals and 70 assists for 85 points with a +/- rating of -7 and 374 penalty minutes. In 54 career post-season games he recorded 1 goal and 7 assists for 8 points with a +2 rating and 47 penalty minutes."

But he showed no patience at the plate, resulting in a decline in average and very few walks. After two years of barely adequate hitting (though compensated by his stellar glovework), he improved markedly in 2004, when he hit .288 with 62 RBI and 25 stolen bases in 159 games. At the end of the season, he earned his first Gold Glove, the first by a Dodger shortstop since Maury Wills' back-to-back honors in 1961 and 1962. In 2005, Izturis hit .348 through June 1 and led the entire majors in hits. He was selected for the National League All-Star team, but his batting average later dipped all the way down into the .250 range. Curiously, his defense also seemed to suffer. After two trips to the disabled list, Izturis underwent Tommy John surgery in his right elbow, and returned in mid-June, 2006. With the uncertainty around Izturis, the Dodgers acquired shortstop Rafael Furcal in the off-season. That move seemed to have put Izturis' future with the Dodgers in doubt. With a $13 million annual salary, Furcal did not seem a likely candidate to be benched."

        "content": "Daneyko was drafted in the first round (18th overall) in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft, the second pick of the New Jersey Devils after the franchise relocated from Colorado; when he was drafted the organization had not yet chosen a new team name.  He spent several seasons in junior before getting drafted, and played for the Yorkton Terriers of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, as well as the Great Falls Americans, Spokane Flyers and Seattle Breakers of the Western Hockey League.  He was called up to the Devils for the start of the 1983\u201384 season, but cracked his fibula during a game against the Hartford Whalers and missed over 40 games.  After his injury healed, he was assigned to the Kamloops Junior Oilers of the WHL for the remainder of the season. Upon his arrival in the NHL, Daneyko established himself as a stay-at-home defenceman, and soon won fans over with his gritty and self-sacrificing play. Daneyko was also known for his missing front teeth, lost after he was hit in the mouth by a puck.  His gap-toothed smile was well known not only by Devils supporters, but by hockey fans around the world.  As a player who had spent all of his NHL career with New Jersey, Daneyko was nicknamed \"Mr. Devil\".  He is also referred to by the nickname \"Dano\". Daneyko acquired over 2,500 penalty minutes in his career, finishing a season with over 200 penalty minutes five times.  Daneyko was never a high-scoring defenceman, and set a record by playing in 255 consecutive regular-season games without scoring a goal.  In his highest-scoring season, 1989\u201390, he scored six goals and 15 assists en route to a 21-point season.  In six seasons he scored no goals at all. He also has the lowest point per game average among all NHL players who played at least 1,000 games with 0.138. However, Daneyko's effectiveness was not measured by how many pucks he put in the net, but by how many pucks he kept out.  Daneyko was used primarily as a shadow defenceman, and often got physical in front of the net if a forward parked himself in the crease looking for a rebound. In the late 1990s, Daneyko struggled with alcoholism while general manager Lou Lamoriello and Devils owner John McMullen stood by him and checked him into rehab. Daneyko recovered and played every game of New Jersey's successful 2000 playoffs, winning the Bill Masterton Trophy in 2000. Along with Scott Stevens, he was part of a tough Devils defensive core that won the Stanley Cup three times, in 1994\u201395, 1999\u20132000 and 2002\u201303.  From the team's first playoff game while in New Jersey, in 1988, Daneyko played in every playoff game until game four of the 2003 quarterfinals. He also was scratched in the first six games of the 2003 finals, but, looking for a spark, coach Pat Burns inserted Daneyko into the lineup for game seven, replacing Oleg Tverdovsky. As a reward to his devotion of the team, and a hint of his impending retirement, Daneyko took the ice for the final shift of the Devils' game seven victory over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, which clinched their third Stanley Cup victory, in 2003. The Devils retired his uniform number, 3, on March 24, 2006. He was the second Devil to receive the honour after Scott Stevens had his No. 4 retired on February 3, 2006. Daneyko currently provides his colour commentary on Devils' broadcasts on MSG Plus. Prior to this, he shared commentary and analysis between periods of Devils' broadcasts and was a regular starring analyst on MSG's \"Hockey Night Live!\" with host Al Trautwig and fellow commentators Ron Duguay, Dave Maloney, Mike Keenan, and Butch Goring, as well as \"The Hockey Maven\" Stan Fischler. In October 2009, Daneyko began competing as a pairs figure skater on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reality show Battle of the Blades. In 2010, Daneyko portrayed himself in the short film Ice Hockey, written and directed by Larry Cohen. The film also featured Randy Velischek. In 2016, Daneyko was inducted into the Ukrainian Sports Hall of Fame."

Jennings Trophy in his first season. He helped the Blues to the Presidents' Trophy that year and the Blues entered the playoffs with high expectations. However, St. Louis was eliminated in seven games by the eighth-seeded San Jose Sharks, with some aggravated Blues fans pinning responsibility on Turek because of some soft goals he allowed, including one in game 7 that was fired from centre ice by Sharks captain Owen Nolan. However, he played a second season with the Blues while being challenged for the starting position by backup Brent Johnson. He put up good numbers again, this time helping the Blues reach the playoffs as the fourth seed, where they again faced the Sharks in the first round. This time, Turek helped the Blues eliminate the Sharks in six games and then helped them sweep the Dallas Stars, his former team, in the second round. However, in the third round against the Colorado Avalanche, soft goals plagued him again (including one scored after an attempt to scoop the puck into his glove with his stick) and again in some fan circles bore the brunt of the blame for the Blues' third round 4\u20131 ouster."

Pesky was signed as an amateur free agent by the Red Sox before the 1940 season and spent the next two seasons in the minor leagues. In 1940, he played for the Rocky Mount Red Sox of the Piedmont League, where he was a teammate of future Hall of Famer Heinie Manush, who was the team's player-manager.

After missing three seasons due to World War II, Pesky came back in 1946, leading the league in hits once again, batting .335, third in the league, and finishing fourth in the MVP voting while also making his first and only All-Star team. His 53 hits in August set a team record for hits in a month, a record later tied by Dom DiMaggio. In 1947, Pesky batted .324 while leading the league in hits for the third consecutive year with 207. In the 1947\u201348 offseason, the Red Sox acquired shortstop Vern Stephens, a three-time All-Star, and asked Pesky to move to third base. The switch took a toll on Pesky, who had his worst season to date as a hitter, as his average dropped to .281. He bounced back to hit over .300 each year from 1949 to 1951, and in 1951 he and Stephens swapped positions, with Pesky returning to short and Stephens moving to third base. Pesky began the 1952 season slowly, and by mid-June he had played in just 25 games, batting .149. He was traded to the Detroit Tigers in a nine-player deal, in which the Red Sox also traded Walt Dropo, Fred Hatfield, Don Lenhardt, and Bill Wight and acquired Hoot Evers, George Kell, Johnny Lipon, and Dizzy Trout. Tigers' manager Fred Hutchinson had Pesky mentor Al Kaline. On the field, Pesky split time at shortstop with Neil Berry, batting .254 in 69 games with the Tigers. In 1953, the Tigers moved Pesky to second base, and his batting average rebounded somewhat to .292.

Former teammate and Sox broadcaster Mel Parnell named the pole after Pesky. The story goes that Pesky won a game for Parnell in 1948 with a home run down the short () right field line, just around the pole. Being that Pesky was a contact hitter who hit only 17 home runs\u2014six of them at Fenway Park\u2014in 4,745 at bats in the major leagues, it's quite possible that the home runs he hit there landed in close proximity to the pole. Research, however, shows that Pesky hit just one home run in a game pitched by Parnell, a two-run shot in the first inning of a game against Detroit played on June 11, 1950. The game was eventually won by the visiting Tigers in the 14th inning on a three-run shot by Tigers right fielder Vic Wertz and Parnell earned a no-decision that day."

A major off-season trade added slugging first baseman Dick Stuart to Pesky's maiden roster, and while Stuart would lead the American League with 118 runs batted in during 1963, he was an atrocious fielder (nicknamed \"Dr. Strangeglove\" and \"Stonefingers\") who would constantly defy Pesky's authority and make it difficult for him to control his players. Pesky's 1963 club started quickly. It won 40 of its first 70 games and on June 28 stood only  games behind the league-leading Yankees. The team's standout performer, relief pitcher Dick Radatz (converted to the bullpen by Pesky at Seattle in 1961), had saved 12 games and won seven others with a 1.16 earned run average to keep the Red Sox in contention to that point. But the team buckled from poor defense and, apart from Radatz and 20-game-winning starter Bill Monbouquette, lack of pitching depth; it went only 36\u201355 for the rest of the campaign to finish 76\u201385 and in seventh place in the ten-team American League. The following year, despite another strong contribution from Radatz and the debut of star 19-year-old rookie outfielder Tony Conigliaro, the 1964 Sox continued to languish in the second division, winning only 70 of the 160 games Pesky managed. With two games left in the season, he was replaced as manager by Billy Herman, the club's third-base coach and a friend of Higgins."

        "content": "After the 1968 season, Pesky returned to the Red Sox organization as a color commentator on the Sox' radio and television announcing crew. A few days after he took on the job, his old friend Ted Williams, newly named manager of the Washington Senators, asked Pesky to be his bench coach and top aide. Although tempted by Williams' offer, Pesky decided to remain in Boston. He worked with Ken Coleman and Ned Martin on Boston's WHDH Radio and TV from 1969 to 1971, then strictly on television with Coleman on WBZ-TV from 1972 to 1974. He later served as analyst for selected games on radio with Joe Castiglione calling play-by-play. In 1975, Pesky finally returned to uniform as a full-time coach under manager Darrell Johnson. As in Pittsburgh, he worked at first base and, in his first season back on the field, the Bosox won the 1975 American League East title, swept the three-time world champion Oakland Athletics in the 1975 American League Championship Series, and battled the Cincinnati Reds in a thrilling, seven-game World Series. Pesky remained first-base coach under Johnson and his successor, Don Zimmer, before moving to a bench and batting coach role for Zimmer in 1980. The Red Sox had been contenders for most of the late 1970s, but in 1980 they stumbled to fourth place in the AL East, resulting in Zimmer's dismissal with five games left in the season. Pesky took command as interim pilot, and Boston lost four of five, to finish Pesky's career managing record at 147\u2013179 (.451). The following season, another old friend, Ralph Houk, became Boston's manager, and Pesky resumed his role as the club's batting and bench coach. He was especially valued by Sox slugger Jim Rice, with whom Pesky worked tirelessly. Pesky missed the entire 1983 season with a serious food allergy that caused severe weight loss, but once the source of the illness was discovered, he was able to return for a final season as a full-time coach in 1984. From 1985 until his death, he served as a special instructor and assistant to the general manager, often suiting up before games to work with players. In 1990, at age 71, he also spent almost 2\u00bd months as interim manager of Boston's top farm club, the Pawtucket Red Sox, when the team's skipper, Ed Nottle, was fired in June."

        "content": "Intermittently, Pesky was allowed to sit on the Red Sox bench during games, but three times was prevented from the task\u2014once by his own general manager, Dan Duquette, a second time when the Baltimore Orioles complained to MLB, and a third time in March 2007, when Major League Baseball announced it would enforce limitations that only six coaches could be in uniform during a game. As an instructor, Pesky was ineligible. On April 3, 2007, the North Shore Spirit, a now-defunct team in the Independent Can-Am League, in Lynn, Massachusetts invited Pesky to sit in their dugout\u2014and serve as an honorary coach\u2014anytime he wanted. When the Red Sox returned to the World Series in 2004 to face the Cardinals for a third time, Pesky was officially a Special Assignment Instructor and watched the final out of Game 4, where the Red Sox sealed a sweep and their first World Series win in 86 years, from the visiting clubhouse at Busch Stadium. In the celebration that immediately followed, he was embraced by members of the Curse-breaking, title-winning Sox such as Tim Wakefield, Curt Schilling and Kevin Millar as a living representative of past Red Sox stars whose teams had fallen short of winning the Fall Classic, at times literally at the final hurdle. As John Powers wrote for the Boston Globe, \"Pesky was the stand-in for all of the Towne Teamers who'd gotten to the World Series and fell short. For teammate Ted Williams, who wept in the clubhouse after batting .200 in 1946. For Jim Lonborg, who won two games with brilliant pitching in 1967 but was battered on two days' rest in the finale. For Carl Yastrzemski, who played on two teams that lost the Series in the seventh game. And for Bill Buckner, who had the grounder go between his legs in 1986.\" He played a poignant and prominent role in the ceremony in which the World Series Championship Rings were handed out (April 11, 2005 before the Red Sox home season opener against the Yankees) \u2013 and he himself was awarded the World Series ring that had eluded him as a player and manager. Bill Simmons, who was present that day, wrote for ESPN in a column that was republished in Now I Can Die In Peace that Pesky received the biggest cheer as a living \"reminder of everything that had happened since 1918.\" (As others had pointed out, not only had Pesky been the shortstop responsible during Slaughter's Mad Dash, but he had been born in 1918 and his wife was named Ruth.) With the help of Carl Yastrzemski, he raised the 2004 World Series Championship banner up the Fenway Park center field flagpole. After the Red Sox swept the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 World Series, Pesky once again received a ring and was given the honor of raising the newest Red Sox Championship banner on April 8, 2008. On his 87th birthday, September 27, 2006, the Red Sox honored Pesky by officially naming the right-field foul pole \"Pesky's Pole\", although it had already been unofficially known as such. On September 23, 2008, the Red Sox announced that they would retire the No. 6 Pesky wore as a player to mark his 89th birthday and his long years of service to the club. (Pesky wore No. 22 as the team's manager in the 1960s, and No. 35 as a coach from 1975 to 1980. Although he reclaimed No. 6 and wore it from 1981 to 1984, between 1985 and its retirement the number also was assigned to players such as Bill Buckner, Rick Cerone, Damon Berryhill and Tony Pe\u00f1a.) Pesky's was the sixth number retired by the Red Sox; his number retired was the first to break the club's code to have a number retired: being in the Baseball Hall of Fame and having spent at least ten years with the Red Sox (Pesky has not been selected for the Hall of Fame). Pesky was a longtime resident of Boston's North Shore, living in Lynn and then Swampscott, Massachusetts. He was a visible member of the community, making personal appearances for the Red Sox. For years, he was a commercial spokesman on television and radio for a local supplier of doors and windows, JB Sash and Door Company. The commercials were deliberately and humorously corny, with Pesky and the company's owner calling themselves \"the Window Boys.\" On May 16, 2009 Pesky was given an honorary degree during Salem State College's 199th commencement ceremony. On April 20, 2012, Boston Red Sox fans celebrated the 100th birthday of Fenway Park, and Johnny Pesky was a participant. He was wheeled out to second base in a wheelchair, aside Bobby Doerr, to join over 200 past Red Sox players and coaches through the decades."

        "content": "Odelein played junior hockey for the Moose Jaw Warriors before being drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the seventh round (141st overall) in 1986. His playing style adapted through his career; primarily used as a defensive defenceman early in his career (as well as an enforcer), but became more of a two-way threat when former Montreal Canadiens coach Jacques Demers used him on the power play. His first NHL goal was a highlight-reel end-to-end rush against Chicago Blackhawks goalie Ed Belfour on December 19, 1991. Odelein won the Stanley Cup with the Montreal Canadiens in 1993. The 1993\u201394 NHL season marked Odelein's career highlight. He scored 11 goals, 29 assists and 40 points, all career highs, scoring 24 of those points in 26 games in February and March that season. As well, he scored a hat trick against the St. Louis Blues and goalie Jim Hrivnak on March 9, 1994. His 5 assists on February 2, 1994, against the Hartford Whalers, tied a single-game record for a Canadiens defenseman held by Doug Harvey, which was also tied in 2004 by Sheldon Souray. Prior to the 1996\u201397 season, Odelein was traded by the Canadiens to the New Jersey Devils for St\u00e9phane Richer on August 22, 1996. In the 1999\u20132000 season, his fourth with the Devils, Odelein was traded by the Devils to the Phoenix Coyotes for Deron Quint and a third round selection on March 7, 2000. Odelein's tenure with the Coyotes was short as he was claimed in the expansion draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets on June 23, 2000. He was later named the first captain of the Blue Jackets before their inaugural season in 2000\u201301. During his second season in Columbus he was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for defensemen Jaroslav \u0160pa\u010dek. The following season he was on the move again when he was traded to the Dallas Stars.  After just three regular season games and two more in the playoffs, he was done in Dallas and found himself without a guaranteed contract offer in the off-season. His next opportunity came from the Florida Panthers who offered him a try out that proved successful and led to a $650,000 one-year contract. For the first\u2014and only\u2014time in his career, Odelein stayed healthy for the full season and played in all 82-games for the Panthers. The Panthers' general manager Rick Dudley expressed interest in retaining Odelein when his contract expired, however, a lockout that erased the 2004-05 NHL season, and a changing of the guard in Florida that saw Dudley replaced by Mike Keenan, spelled the end of Odelein in Florida. His final NHL stint came with the Pittsburgh Penguins when he inked a one-year, $500,000 deal on September 2, 2005. However, he managed just 27 games before injuring his knee, gaining just a single assist, and retired from professional hockey. Odelein finished his NHL career with 182 fights and his 2,316 career penalty minutes place him 29th all-time."

Nicknamed \"Nabby\", Nabokov, who was selected 219th overall 1994 NHL Entry Draft by San Jose, was regarded as one of the top goaltenders in the NHL, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as the best first-year player in 2001 and was voted a finalist for the Vezina Trophy as best goaltender in 2008. He departed the NHL for the first time in 2010 to play for SKA Saint Petersburg in Russia, but returned soon after, and concluded his career in the NHL. After retiring as a player Nabokov took up a role as a development coach for the Sharks, and in 2019 was named the goaltending coach for team. In his first nine seasons in the NHL, all with San Jose, Nabokov became the team leader in nearly every goaltending category, including games played, wins, and shutouts. At his retirement, he had the eighteenth most all-time NHL regular season wins. During a game in 2002 he scored a goal, the seventh goalie in NHL history to do so, and the first not from North America. Born in the then-Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, Nabokov first played internationally with Kazakhstan at the 1994 World Championships Group C. However, he later joined the Russian national team, and played for them from 2006, including both the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics, winning a gold at the 2008 World Championships."

After his last season with the club he was selected in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft by the San Jose Sharks in the ninth round, 219th overall. Tim Burke, the Sharks' scout, was originally scouting for a different goalie when he heard of Nabokov. The Sharks never saw Nabokov play before selecting him in the draft, and did not contact him until 1997. The following season Nabokov moved to join Dynamo Moscow, where he would spend the next three seasons. His first year with Dynamo they won the league championship It was after the 1996\u201397 season, which saw Nabokov help Dynamo reach the final of the European Hockey League, that he was contacted by the Sharks and offered a contract and come to North America. Happy to play for Dynamo Moscow, Nabokov was initially reluctant to move to North America and play for the Sharks minor league affiliates, but decided to on the advice of his parents. Assigned to the Kentucky Thoroughblades, the Sharks' affiliate in the American Hockey League (AHL), he struggled to adapt to the new surroundings and style of hockey, and was ready to return to Russia during his first year. However he decided to stay after meeting his future wife, Tabitha, and refining his playing style with the Sharks goaltending coach, Warren Strelow. Used as the Thoroughblades back-up goalie, Nabokov only played in 33 games for the team. The following season was much better as he stayed near the AHL leaders in nearly every goaltending category, though he missed time due to appendicitis; he appeared in 43 games for Kentucky, winning 26 of them."

        "content": "Nabokov started the 1999\u20132000 season with the Sharks affiliate, the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the International Hockey League (IHL). After 20 games with Cleveland, where he had a record of twelve wins, four losses, and three ties, Nabokov was  recalled to the Sharks to serve as the back-up to Steve Shields, after Mike Vernon was traded. Nabokov made his NHL debut on January 1, 2000, in relief of Shields, against the Nashville Predators. His first start came January 19 against the Colorado Avalanche; Nabokov made 39 saves for his first shutout in a 0\u20130 tie. He finished with 11 games played for the Sharks during the 1999\u201300 NHL season, winning two and losing two. In the second game of the 2000\u201301 season, Shields hurt his ankle, leaving Nabokov to become the starting goalie. He appeared in 66 games and had a record of 32 wins and 21 losses, and was named to the mid-season All-Star Game. In recognition of his play, Nabokov was named the winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy as the rookie of the year, and was named to the year-end All-Rookie Team; he also finished fourth in voting for the Vezina Trophy for best goalie in the league. He had similar success the following season, with 37 wins and 7 shutouts in 67 games, and on March 10, 2002 he scored a goal against the Vancouver Canucks, both the first European goalie to do so, and the first goalie to score a powerplay goal. At the start of the 2002\u201303 season, Nabokov held out in a contract dispute. After making less than $1 million the previous two seasons, he felt he deserved an increase in salary, speculated to be around $4 million per season. He missed five games before the team signed him to a two-year contract worth slightly more than $3.5 million per season. Both Nabokov and the Sharks had a poor season, with the team missing the playoffs for the first time in six years, and Nabokov only winning 19 games, and finishing with a losing record. This was improved upon in 2003\u201304 though, as Nabokov's 31 wins helped the team reach the playoffs again, where they reached the third round for the first time in team history. A further two-year extension signed in 2004 saw him earn almost $4.5 million per year. Nabokov was considered one of the elite goaltenders in the NHL, and was often ranked as one of the top ten, if not top five goaltenders in the NHL by ESPN The Magazine and The Hockey News. However, the 2005\u201306 season was an off year for Nabokov, and his save percentage of under .900 was a big concern to the team. He was relegated to the role of backup goaltender behind Vesa Toskala. Despite his less-than-stellar play, Nabokov was signed to a four-year contract extension worth roughly $21.5 million in February 2006. The contract had a no-trade clause that was activated on the condition that San Jose made the playoffs. During the 2006\u201307 NHL season, Nabokov split the starting goaltending duties with Toskala. In the Sharks 82 games Nabokov started 49. Nabokov played all 5 games in the Western Conference Quarterfinals of the 2007 NHL playoffs, helping the Sharks defeat the Nashville Predators in 5 games. During the first half of the 2007\u201308 NHL season, Nabokov started the first 43 games for the Sharks, however on January 13, 2008, in Anaheim he received his first day off when Thomas Greiss started his first NHL game. Nabokov was recognized as one of the \"Three Stars\" for the NHL in the last week of December 2007, along with Alexander Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals and Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr of the New York Rangers. In addition to that honor, Nabokov was named the \"Sharks Player of the Month\" by Seagate Technology in December. Since the 1996\u201397 season, Seagate Technology has recognized Sharks players who made contributions to further the team\u2019s accomplishments and makes a donation of $2,500 to The Sharks Foundation on the players\u2019 behalf. Nabokov holds the franchise-record for having won this award nine times. Nabokov played in his second NHL All-Star Game on January 27, 2008. He stopped all eight shots that came at him, marking the first time since Nikolai Khabibulin's period in the 2002 game that a goalie played an All-Star period where no goals were scored. He secured the scoreless period when he blocked both of Ilya Kovalchuk\u2019s shots in the last minute of the second period. On May 4, during game six of the 2008 NHL Playoffs Western Conference Semi-Finals, Nabokov made what has been called one of the best glove saves in decades, when he saved a shot from Brad Richards of the Dallas Stars by sliding over from the other side of the post and gloving the puck. The save was reviewed for several minutes before making it clear Nabokov saved it before it went over the goal line. The game, which ended in a Dallas victory, lasted for four overtime periods and is the eighth longest game in the league's history. Nabokov recorded 41 wins for San Jose during the following season as the team clinched first overall in the Western Conference and the league. Despite this, San Jose was  eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by eighth seed Anaheim Ducks, marking just the fourth time that an eighth seed team defeated a first seed team in the first round of the playoffs. On October 17, 2009, he played in his 500th career game, all played with the Sharks, and stopped 31 shots in a 4\u20131 win over the New York Islanders. On February 11, 2010, Nabokov stopped a career-high 50 shots en route to a 3\u20132 shootout victory against the Detroit Red Wings, which was also his 11th consecutive road victory, a new NHL record."

An unrestricted free agent, Nabokov did not see any offers from NHL teams, and so signed a contract with SKA St. Petersburg of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). The deal was reported to be for $24 million over four years. The salary was in line with demands Nabokov had apparently been seeking, though he denied money was a factor, but rather signed because of the length of the contract. Nabokov struggled in the KHL, and after 22 games with SKA he was released by the team in December, which cited \"family circumstances\" in a statement. During his lone season in the KHL, Nabokov recorded eight wins and eight losses, with a goals against average and save percentage far above his career averages. Once again a free agent, Nabokov signed a contract with the Detroit Red Wings on January 20, 2011; the Red Wings were one of the top teams in the NHL at the time, and Nabokov signed a contract for just $570,000 as a result. However as he had started the season in the KHL, NHL rules required him to be placed on waivers prior to joining the Red Wings, and thus be available at that salary to any team lower than them in the standings. He was subsequently claimed by the New York Islanders, who were one of the worst teams in the NHL at the time. As he had only signed with Detroit in hopes of playing in the playoffs that year, Nabokov refused to join the Islanders, stating that he didn't make a lot of sense to him why they claimed him. The Islanders suspended Nabokov for failing to join the team, and he sat out the rest of the season. In August 2011, Nabokov stated that he would be reporting to New York's training camp. He played for the team the entirety of the 2011\u201312 season, wearing the number 20, and eventually took over the starting goaltender position. He got his first win with the team on October 15, 2011, against the New York Rangers. On January 14, 2012, Nabokov recorded his 300th career win against the Buffalo Sabres, becoming the 26th goaltender to reach the milestone. On March 21, 2012 he signed a one-year, $2.75 million contract extension to remain with New York for another season, followed by another one-year $3.25 million contract for the 2013\u201314 season. After New York signed goaltenders Jaroslav Halak and Chad Johnson in the 2014 off-season, it became clear they didn't have plans to re-sign Nabokov. On July 1, 2014, he signed a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning worth $1.55 million. After posting a 3\u20136\u20132 record as the team's backup goaltender to Ben Bishop, he was placed on waivers around the midpoint of the season, February 1, 2015. Following his waivers clear, it was questioned as to whether he would report to Tampa Bay's AHL affiliate or consider retirement. On February 9, 2015, Nabokov was traded back to the Sharks for \"future considerations\". He announced his retirement on February 11, 2015."

The IIHF granted Nabokov an exemption to play for Russia at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Nabokov would play seven games during the Olympics, winning four and earning three shutouts as the Russians finished fourth. He next represented Russia at the 2008 World Championships.

Nabokov next joined Russia for the 2008 IIHF World Championship, arriving after the Sharks were eliminated in the NHL playoffs. He appeared in five games, winning them all, and helped Russia win their first gold medal since 1993, and was named as the tournament's best goaltender and put on the tournament all-star team. The starting goalie for Russia at the 2010 Winter Olympics, Nabokov helped Russia reach the quarterfinals against Canada. However he allowed four goals in the first period and was subsequently pulled, with Russia ultimately losing 7\u20133. Nabokov finished the Olympics with a record of two wins and one loss as the Russians placed sixth overall. His final appearance in an international tournament was at the 2011 IIHF World Championship. Nabokov played four games for Russia, winning two and losing one, before a groin injury forced him to leave the tournament; Russia would finish fourth."

Nabokov first played hockey when he was six years old, taking up the same position his father had played. When he moved to North America in 1997, Nabokov initially went by the name \"John\", fearing that English speakers might have difficulty pronouncing his name. Nabokov met his wife, Tabitha Eckler, shortly after he began playing in Kentucky. She was a college student and waitress at the time. They were married in 2001.

        "content": "Graham began his NFL career with the Giants in 1992, after the team drafted him in the eighth round of that year's NFL Draft. Due to injuries to starters Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler, Graham was forced into the starting lineup and started three games before he too was injured. He stayed with the team for two more years, only getting one more start, before leaving to play with the Detroit Lions in 1995.  After not seeing any action, he signed with the Arizona Cardinals in 1996, where he eventually became the team's starting quarterback.  In two separate stints as Cardinals quarterback, Graham threw for a combined 3,032 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. Graham returned to the Giants in 1998 to serve as backup to Danny Kanell, who had led the team to the NFC East title the previous year. He moved into the starting lineup in Week 12 after Kanell had led the Giants to a 3 - 7 record in the first ten games. Graham led the Giants to two wins in his first three starts, then secured a major upset over the then-undefeated and eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos in Week 15 by throwing a late touchdown pass to Amani Toomer to clinch the victory. Graham finished the season 5-1 as the team's starter, and won his final four starts. Graham started the 1999 season as the starter ahead of offseason acquisition Kerry Collins. He held a winning record in his nine starts, finishing 5-4, but struggled most of the year.  After back-to-back ineffective performances he was benched during a Week 11 game against the Washington Redskins in favor of Collins.  He did not see another snap as a Giant.  Graham was released during the off-season (February 10, 2000) due to his lack of consistency and to create room under the salary cap. In February 2000 Graham was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers on a $5.1 million deal over three years to replace Mike Tomczak, who had been released in the off-season, as the backup for Kordell Stewart. In the wake of Stewart, who was having to cope with drastic changes to the offensive team members (including Tomczak, who had served as his mentor), having a mediocre 1999 season and a competitive first training camp, Steelers coach Bill Cowher (who, according to media rumors, was nearly fired by the Steelers organization for giving Stewart too many chances ) assigned Graham as the starting quarterback for the start of the 2000 season.  Despite solid efforts, Graham performed less than impressive, beginning the season 0-3 due to Pittsburgh's defensive weaknesses.  In the third game of the season vs. the Tennessee Titans, Graham threw for 254 yards in one of the best offensive showings for the Steelers in over two seasons before injuring his hip late in the game and being replaced by Stewart, who went on to lead the team to two straight victories as Graham recovered.  This built a quarterback controversy among fans and media, as many of the Steeler faithful supported Graham ahead of Stewart despite Stewart's recent successes with the team (having led the team to the playoffs twice in his first two full years as starter). However, Graham struggled mightily upon his return to the Steelers and eventually lost whatever playing time he had earned. After platooning with Graham, Stewart returned to the starting position and Graham was cut at the end of the year. In 2001, he was signed by the Redskins.  After initial starter Jeff George was cut, Graham became the team's second stringer for much of the season. In 2002, Graham was picked in the expansion draft by the Houston Texans to be their third-string quarterback.  He never played again."

He finished his rookie season starting 32 games, pitching 172 innings and striking out 139 batters. In , as part of a young Expos rotation of \"twentysomething\", \"tall\", \"power\" pitchers V\u00e1zquez started the season as the team's number three pitcher but, after being sent back to the minor leagues would miss a month and a half of the major league season.  He finished the year with 26 starts, including his first career shut out September 14 against the Dodgers, 154 innings and 131 strikeouts causing ESPN to write that he had \"turn[ed] the corner ... dramatically.\" He was the losing pitcher when David Cone, of the New York Yankees, pitched a perfect game against the Expos on July 18, 1999. In , V\u00e1zquez had become the opening day start of the Expos.

The Expos won a close game five to four.  He pitched better the following start, the home opener at Olympic Stadium striking out nine without issuing any walks in seven innings and would finish the season with 223 innings pitched, 208 strikeouts, while only walking 44. In , V\u00e1zquez pitched a then career high 230 innings striking out 179 batters while walking 49.  Despite this he lost his arbitration case following the season and was awarded $6 million rather than his requested $7.15 million. In , V\u00e1zquez pitched 230 innings striking out a then career high 241 batters while walking 57.  Regarded as one of the league's top pitchers he signaled to then GM Omar Minaya that he might not resign with the Expos, a team then threatened with contraction.  Later when asked by the New York Times about his experience in Montreal that year he said it was tough \"being over there having no owner. If you needed somebody the last couple years when we were in the hunt, especially last year, we couldn't get a player we needed.\"  The article went on to note that for financial reasons the Expos not only couldn't \"obtain players from other teams who might have helped the Expos stay in the wild-card race, but the Expos also weren't allowed to call up players from the minor leagues.\""

His curveball was thought to be especially difficult to hit; in 2004 Sandy Alomar, Jr. called it the \"best breaking ball I've seen; Bert Blyleven doesn't throw it better [...] you don't know where it's going to land.

        "content": "The 6'5\" (1.96 m) Rider was a prep star at Encinal High School in Alameda, California (just outside Oakland) and was one of the top rated players in the state. Rider attended two junior colleges, Allen County Community College in Iola, Kansas, where he averaged just over 30 points per game; and Antelope Valley College in Lancaster, California (33 points per game), before finding a home at UNLV. During the 1991\u20131992 season, Rider led the Runnin' Rebels to a 26-2 record (18-0 in conference) and a number 7 ranking in the final Associated Press regular season poll while averaging over 21 points per game, but wasn't seen on national television because UNLV was serving an NCAA-imposed punishment that stemmed from previous infractions. (In a \"plea bargain\" of sorts, UNLV was allowed to defend its NCAA title the previous year \u2013 they lost to Duke in the Final Four.  In exchange, the Rebels were barred from postseason play and national television for the 1991\u201392 season.) He finally got the nation's eyes to watch him in his senior year, where he averaged 29.1 points per game (2nd in the country behind University of Texas-Pan American's Greg Guy), was named the Big West Conference Player of the Year and garnered 2nd-Team All-American honors. UNLV finished 21-8 (13-5 in Big West Conference), lost the regular season conference title to New Mexico State and failed to make the NCAA's 64-team Tournament field. The Rebels did earn a spot in the National Invitation Tournament, but Rider was suspended for the NIT due to academic issues surrounding allegations that he had someone cheating for him on some of his college classwork. Without their star player on the court, the Runnin' Rebels were knocked out of the NIT in the 1st round 90-73 to Southern California."

Rider started his NBA career strong, finishing the 1993\u201394 season as a member of the NBA's All-Rookie First Team. He won the 1994 NBA Slam Dunk Contest (he brashly predicted that he would win on draft day) with a dunk that he called \"The East Bay Funk Dunk.\" Rider also became famous for a miraculous shot made in a game on December 22, 1994, against the Sacramento Kings. Losing control of the ball with it nearly going out of bounds, Rider reached out and threw the ball over his shoulder to keep it in play, and the ball went through the hoop as a three-point basket, a play that one announcer exclaimed as the \"Play of the decade.\" While Rider averaged 19 points per game in his three years with the Timberwolves, his play slipped after his rookie season.  He also began a pattern of off-court misbehavior. He was found to be insubordinate towards Timberwolves management, and was involved in an incident in which he kicked the female manager of a sports bar for which he ultimately was convicted of fifth-degree assault.  By 1996, Minnesota finally lost patience with Rider and dealt him to Portland in return for Bill Curley, James Robinson and a conditional first round draft pick in 1997 or 1998. Just before the trade Rider was arrested for marijuana possession. At the time of his arrest he also had an illegal cell phone; it had been altered to charge calls to someone else's bill. He was later convicted of misdemeanor marijuana possession, and pleaded no contest to possessing the illegal cell phone. Three weeks later, he was arrested for gambling in public back in Oakland."

The Hawks had finished fourth in the Eastern Conference in the lockout-shortened season, and thought Rider was the final piece in the puzzle. So they sent Smith to the Blazers for Rider and Jim Jackson, another talent who had not quite reached his potential.  The trade didn't sit well with Hawks fans, since Smith had been one of the most popular players on the team.  Coach Lenny Wilkens didn't want the trade either, but tried to fit Rider into the system. Rider played well enough on the court, pacing the Hawks in scoring. However, his off-court incidents exploded in Atlanta. After reports that he had smoked marijuana in an Orlando hotel room, the league demanded that he attend drug counseling. He refused and was fined a total of $200,000 until he agreed to attend.  He was suspended numerous times by the Hawks as well, and fined a total of $200,000 by the team.  Even after Wilkens benched him in March with the Hawks long out of contention, Rider still continued to be tardy for games and practices, prompting the Hawks to threaten a three-game suspension for another incident.  He showed up late for a March game in Detroit, and rather than serve a three-game suspension, he demanded his outright release. The Hawks complied."

Shortly after, he signed a six-year, $37.8 million contract extension with them, a deal which made him the highest paid Finn in the NHL. At the time, Timonen's younger brother Jussi Timonen was playing for the Philadelphia Phantoms, the Flyers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate. However, Jussi was subsequently traded to the Dallas Stars early in the 2007\u201308 season. The Flyers beat the Washington Capitals 4\u20133 and the Montreal Canadiens 4\u20131 in the first two rounds of the 2008 Stanley Cup playoffs. During Game 4 of the Flyers' series with Montreal, Timonen was hit by a wrist shot on his foot by Canadiens defenseman Andrei Markov. Timonen felt numbness in his foot as the week progressed, though believed it to be nothing but a twisted nerve. After an MRI failed to reveal any injury, Timonen had the foot examined at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where, on 8 May, the doctor found a small blood clot in his foot. He was sidelined indefinitely and missed the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Timonen returned for Game 5, but the Flyers eventually lost the game and their playoff run came to an end. In the 2009\u201310 regular season, Timonen led all NHL defensemen in shorthanded goals scored, with two. That year, Timonen would play in his first ever Stanley Cup Final, though the Flyers would lose to the Chicago Blackhawks in a six-game series. Timonen scored his 100th career goal on 5 March 2011, against the Buffalo Sabres. He ended the season in a tie with Marc Staal for most shorthanded goals among defensemen, with two. Timonen recorded his 500th career point with an assist on 1 March 2012, against the New York Islanders. He played his 1,000th NHL game on 18 March 2013, his 37th birthday."

He helped Senegal reach the quarter finals, most notably in scoring a memorable goal against Denmark in the first round, although he was subsequently red-carded. At the club, he tended to be used out of position by Houllier, often played at centre back or full back and as a result never had the chance to demonstrate whether he was capable of playing a central midfield role for the club, although the evidence did suggest he was somewhat out of his depth. His first Liverpool goal came against Spartak Moscow in the Champions League. He scored a total of three goals, only one coming in the league, in a 1\u20130 win at Leeds United in October 2002. He was left out of Liverpool's squad for the victorious 2003 Football League Cup Final despite playing often in the earlier rounds, including the semi-final first leg against Sheffield United. Diao was played in his correct position by Rafa Ben\u00edtez but several poor displays saw him displaced by Xabi Alonso notably after a 4\u20132 win at Fulham. Liverpool were 2\u20130 down when Diao was substituted, he had been at fault for one of the goals Fulham scored whilst attempting a bizarre back heel. Despite not having featured for months Diao was present in Istanbul when Liverpool won the Champions League in 2005. He appeared only once in the campaign, coming on as a substitute away at Olympiacos in the group stage. It was during the 2004\u201305 season that Diao scored his last Liverpool goal against Millwall in the League Cup, and he played his last game for Liverpool at Norwich City in January 2005. In January 2005 Birmingham City took Diao, who had struggled to make Liverpool's first team, on loan for the rest of the season but he had his spell at Birmingham ended by injury almost immediately. The arrival of Rafael Ben\u00edtez and defensive midfielder Mohamed Sissoko, signalled the end of his Liverpool career. Althougu Sissoko was branded the \"new Vieira\" by Ben\u00edtez, Diao had received this same tag from Houllier upon his arrival at Liverpool. Diao was not issued a squad number by Liverpool for the 2005\u201306 season, with his number 15 being given to new signing Peter Crouch. He joined Portsmouth in August 2005 on a season long loan but spent much of the season out injured. At the end of the season Pompey manager Harry Redknapp decided not to take up the option to sign him permanently because of his injury-proneness. In July 2006 Diao was taken on trial by Premiership side Charlton Athletic. He failed a medical at the club, thus ending his chances of signing."

He became a consistent player for Stoke, holding the team together, slowing down the tempo and speed of the game. It is thought that the revival of Stoke City during the 2006\u201307 season was in a large part due to Salif's hard-working performances. On 25 January 2007, his contract at Stoke was extended until the end of the season. At the end of the 2006\u201307 season Diao was released by Liverpool and was expected to sign for Stoke but did not sign a deal with the club because he was worried about his fitness levels. He eventually signed permanently for Stoke on a one and a half-year deal in December 2007. Diao put in some decent performances for Stoke including games against former club Liverpool and man of the match performances against Chelsea and Sunderland. In June 2009 he was offered a new one-year contract to stay at the Britannia Stadium, which he accepted. He scored his first goal for the club in an away win at Portsmouth in February 2010. It was only Diao's second ever league goal and with his first coming six years before. Diao left Stoke after he rejected a new contract which would have given a joint role as a club ambassador and player. However Diao changed his mind and agreed to sign a new contract with Stoke. During the 2010\u201311 season Diao played eleven times for Stoke and was an unused substitute in the 2011 FA Cup Final.

Over nine seasons with the Canucks, Lumme was named the club's annual top defenceman on four occasions, became the team's all-time top goal- and point-scoring defenceman, and was a part of the squad's run to the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. Towards the end of his NHL career, he additionally played for the Phoenix Coyotes, Dallas Stars and Toronto Maple Leafs over the span of five seasons. In 2005, Lumme returned to Ilves Tampere of the SM-liiga after a two-year playing hiatus. He played two final campaigns in Finland before retiring, at which point he became a part-owner of Ilves Tampere."

Following his rookie season in Finland, Lumme was selected by the Montreal Canadiens in the 3rd round (57th overall) of the 1986 NHL Entry Draft.  He remained with Ilves Tampere for two seasons following his draft. In his final year before transferring to the NHL, Lumme scored 8 goals and 30 points over 43 games to help Ilves to the best regular season record in the league. In August 1988, Lumme signed a two-year contract with the Canadiens. Playing his first season in North America, Lumme split the 1988\u201389 campaign between Montreal and their minor league affiliate, the Sherbrooke Canadiens of the American Hockey League (AHL). He became the first Finnish player to compete for the Canadiens in team history. While playing in an NHL game against the Detroit Red Wings on December 5, 1988, he suffered a knee injury, sidelining him for some time. He finished the season with 15 points over 26 AHL games, while registering 4 points over 21 NHL games within the Canadiens organization. The following season, Lumme earned a full-time NHL roster spot with the Canadiens. After scoring 20 points over 54 games with Montreal during the campaign, he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on March 6, 1990. In exchange for Lumme, Montreal acquired the St. Louis Blues' second-round selection in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft (previously acquired by Vancouver; Montreal selected Craig Darby). In retrospect of the trade, Lumme recalls not fitting into the Canadiens' playing style and expecting to be dealt away."

He was placed on a defensive pairing with Paul Reinhart immediately after the trade and scored 10 points in 11 games to finish the regular season. In his first full season with Vancouver, Lumme improved to 32 points over 80 games. The following season, he recorded his first of back-to-back 44-point seasons and earned his first of four Babe Pratt Trophies as the team's top defenceman.  In 1993\u201394, Lumme posted a career-high 55 points, second only to late-season acquisition Jeff Brown among team defencemen.  He added 13 points in 24 playoff games, helping Vancouver to the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated by the New York Rangers in seven games. Due to the subsequent 1994\u201395 NHL lockout, Lumme returned to Finland to play for Ilves Tampere. He recorded 8 points in 12 games before NHL play resumed midway through the campaign, at which point he returned to the Canucks. Lumme continued as one of the Canucks' standout defencemen for the duration of his time with the club, as his defensive game improved as well. He fell only one point short of his career high during the 1995\u201396 season, scoring 54 points \u2014 first among team defencemen. He also managed a personal best 17 goals.  The following season, he won his fourth and final Babe Pratt Trophy in 1997.  Lumme led the Canucks' defence in scoring his final two years in Vancouver before becoming an unrestricted free agent in July 1998 and signing with the Phoenix Coyotes.  He left Vancouver as the franchise's all-time leading scorer among defencemen in goals with 83 (surpassed by Mattias \u00d6hlund on December 15, 2007) and points with 321 (tied Dennis Kearns and since surpassed by \u00d6hlund)."

With 28-, 40- and 25-point seasons in Phoenix, Lumme finishing second among team defencemen in scoring behind Teppo Numminen in all three campaigns.  On June 23, 2001, he was traded from Phoenix to the Dallas Stars in exchange for forward Tyler Bouck. Lumme played 15 games with the club in 2001\u201302.  He left the Stars on October 29, 2001, to briefly visit his family in Finland after receiving permission from general manager Bob Gainey.  His wife Minna and two kids had planned to join Lumme in Dallas during the season, but were reluctant to take a plane after the recent 9/11 terrorist attacks.  Lumme and coach Ken Hitchcock clashed openly during his brief time in Dallas, however, and he was put on waivers.  After clearing, he was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for another veteran blueliner, Dave Manson, on November 21, 2001.  The deal was initiated by Maple Leafs general manager Pat Quinn, Lumme's former coach and general manager in Vancouver, who commended Lumme as a \"cornerstone\" for the Canucks' success during his time with the club. Near the end of the season, Lumme was suspended two games for cross-checking Buffalo Sabres forward J. P. Dumont in a game on March 2, 2002. He also missed an additional four games with a shoulder injury. Following the trade from Dallas, he posted 12 points in 51 games for Toronto. During the 2002 playoffs, Lumme suffered a concussion and re-aggravated his shoulder during the second round against the Ottawa Senators. He suffered the injury after being hit into the boards by opposing forward Chris Neil. Sidelined for the remainder of the playoffs, he watched as the Leafs were eliminated by the Carolina Hurricanes in the semifinals. After discovering his shoulder injury did not require surgery, Lumme spent the 2003 off-season rehabilitating himself in Vancouver, British Columbia. Prior to the 2002\u201303 season, he was left unprotected for the NHL's waiver draft.  With Lumme set to earn $2.75 million that season, however, he went unselected and remained with Toronto, scoring 17 points in 73 games.  He played his last NHL game on April 23, 2003, registering an assist against the Philadelphia Flyers. At the end of the season, the Maple Leafs bought out the final remaining year on Lumme's contract for two-thirds of his expected $1.5 million salary. After his buy out, Lumme took a two-year playing hiatus. During this time, he returned to Vancouver, doing broadcast work for Finnish television. He also became a part-owner of his former Finnish club, Ilves Tampere. In 2005, he returned to play for Ilves. Following his retirement in 2007, Lumme became a part-owner of the Ilves hockey club."

After his parents separated, Lavoyda raised Urlacher and his siblings in Lovington, New Mexico. He spent his youth immersed in sports, and developed an interest in football, basketball, track and later table tennis; he graduated from Lovington High School in 1996. While his mother worked several jobs to keep her family afloat, Urlacher spent his teenage years playing sports for Lovington High School and training in weight rooms. As he progressed through high school, Urlacher gained experience in all three phases of football. He saw playing time as a running back, wide receiver, return specialist, and defensive back. Urlacher led the Lovington High School Wildcats to an undefeated 14\u20130 season, and a division 3-A state championship. He finished the season with twelve touchdown receptions, six touchdown returns, and two rushing touchdowns. He additionally received state-recognized honors in football, as well as basketball. Lovington has since recognized Urlacher's accomplishments by retiring his high-school jersey number, and naming a holiday after him. Urlacher wanted to attend Texas Tech University, but the school did not offer him an athletic scholarship."

Their head coach, Dennis Franchione, converted Urlacher to linebacker, but often left him on the sidelines in favor of more experienced players. The team finished with winning records during Urlacher's first two years and even made a trip to the 1997 Insight.com Bowl. The team's success prompted Franchione to leave New Mexico in favor of Texas Christian University.  His departure prompted the school to hire Rocky Long, a former coach at UCLA. Urlacher flourished under Long's tenure. Urlacher not only received more playing time, but also played a more versatile role on both offense and defense. Long converted Urlacher into a \"Lobo-Back\", a cross between a linebacker and free safety, and placed him in a 3-3-5 defense scheme. He spent significant time training with the team's defensive coordinator, Bronco Mendenhall, who helped Urlacher refine his skills as a defensive back. Long also used Urlacher as a return specialist and wide receiver throughout his final two years with the Lobos. Despite Long's extensive changes to the team's roster, formations, and work ethic, the Lobos' performance declined. However, Urlacher became one of the team's most productive players during this time. He finished his career with 442 tackles, three interceptions, 11 sacks, and 11 forced fumbles. Outside of defense, he caught six touchdown passes, and returned five kicks for touchdowns. After the 1999 season, he was one of the finalists for the Jim Thorpe Award, and finished twelfth on the Heisman Trophy ballot. Urlacher received All-American honors from Walter Camp, Football Writers Association of America, and the Associated Press. He played his final collegiate game at the 2000 Senior Bowl, where he was one of the game's top players. Urlacher led the nation with 178 tackles during his junior year, and also set a school record for most tackles in a single season. He finished with the third most career tackles in the University of New Mexico's history. The school has honored Urlacher on several occasions. They awarded him with the Male Athlete of the Year Award in 2000, and held a special halftime ceremony to honor his success in 2006. Urlacher was also the first person to be inducted into the University of New Mexico's Football Wall of Fame. On November 9, 2013, during halftime of New Mexico's game against Air Force, the school retired Urlacher's No. 44 jersey. Urlacher was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame on December 5, 2017."

Dick Jauron, who was then the Bears' head coach, recognized Urlacher's versatility as a middle and outside linebacker, and appointed him as the team's starting strongside linebacker. However, Urlacher struggled to perform consistently in his first professional game, and lost his starting position to Rosevelt Colvin. Jauron left Urlacher on the sidelines during the following week, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers shut out the Bears, 41\u20130. He managed to regain a starting spot on the Bears' roster, after Barry Minter, the team's veteran middle linebacker, was forced to miss the Week 3 game on account of an injury. Urlacher excelled at the middle linebacker position, and recorded 46 tackles, six sacks, and one interception in his next five starts. Not even a rib cage injury hindered his performance during this period, as Urlacher went on to win the league's Rookie Defensive Player of the Month in October. He led the Bears with 124 tackles and eight sacks, both of which surpassed the franchise's previous rookie records. Although the Bears finished with a disappointing 5\u201311 record, Urlacher received a number of individual accolades for his performance during the season. Many news organizations, such as the Associated Press and The Sporting News named him as the 2000 Defensive Rookie of the Year. Football fans across the nation also voted Urlacher to play at the 2001 Pro Bowl as an alternate middle linebacker. Urlacher's successful rookie campaign served as the foundation for his professional career and reputation. Urlacher further distinguished himself as one of the Bears' most productive playmakers during the 2001 season. He had one of the best games of his career on October 7, against the Atlanta Falcons. Urlacher held Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, who was well known for his scrambling abilities, to 18 rushing yards, and recorded a forced fumble and sack. He also returned one of Vick's fumbles for a 90-yard touchdown. Two weeks later, Urlacher helped set up a Bears comeback victory against the San Francisco 49ers by intercepting a pass, and later setting up a game-winning touchdown return for Mike Brown, after causing 49ers wide receiver Terrell Owens to lose control of a pass. He also caught a touchdown pass from punter Brad Maynard off a fake field goal attempt against the Washington Redskins in Week 14, which clinched a first-round bye. Urlacher concluded the season with three interceptions, six sacks, and was a candidate for 2001 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award. Football Digest named Urlacher their publication's defensive player of the year. The 2001 Chicago Bears won 13 games, marking the team's best finish since 1986, but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Divisional Playoffs. Unfortunately, the Bears' 2001 winning season would be followed by three years of mediocrity. Before the 2004 NFL season, the Bears' organization fired coach Dick Jauron and then hired Lovie Smith. After the Bears started the season on the lower rungs of the NFC North, Urlacher suffered several injuries that sidelined him for a majority of the season."

Urlacher himself recorded at least 10 tackles in six consecutive games, while finishing the season with a team high 121 tackles. He was also credited as one of the team's leaders, whose audibles and experience helped develop several younger teammates. Urlacher led the Bears to an 11\u20135 record, marking their best finish since 2001. Urlacher played his second career playoff game against the Carolina Panthers on January 15, 2006. He recorded seven tackles and one interception in a 29\u201321 loss. Urlacher was also selected to the 2006 Pro Bowl, but declined the position on account of an injury. The team continued their resurgence into the 2006 season, finishing with a record of 13\u20133. During the season, Urlacher had one of the best performances of his professional career against the Arizona Cardinals. He helped the Bears overcome a 20-point deficit by recording 19 tackles and a forced fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Teammate Devin Hester commented on Urlacher's performance, stating, \"We watched the film and everybody was saying that he just turned into the Incredible Hulk the last four minutes of the game, just killing people and running over and tackling whoever had the ball.\" The Bears won the NFC Championship against the New Orleans Saints, 39\u201314, but lost Super Bowl XLI to the Indianapolis Colts, 29\u201317. Urlacher finished the season with 93 tackles and three forced fumbles. He was elected to the 2006 All-Pro Team and 2007 Pro Bowl, while also earning consideration for the League's Defensive Player of the Year award. The Bears were unable to replicate their success in the 2007 season, and finished last in the NFC North. In the middle of the season, Urlacher admitted that he had been suffering from an arthritic back, but later claimed the ailment was not serious. Nevertheless, he finished the season on a high note, registering five interceptions, five sacks, one fumble recovery, 123 tackles, and a defensive touchdown. Following the season's conclusion, Urlacher received minor neck surgery to treat his arthritic back. During the offseason, Urlacher revised his contract with the Bears, who granted him a $6\u00a0million signing bonus with a $1\u00a0million increase in salary each of the next four years. Urlacher dislocated his wrist in the 2009 season opener against the Packers. He underwent surgery, and went on to miss the remainder of the season. Urlacher had severely damaged a bone in his wrist that was adjacent to a major nerve. Urlacher was forced to wear a cast on his wrist for 12 weeks and spend a month in therapy to recover from the injury. The Bears began to struggle on offense and defense. As frustration built, Urlacher criticized the Bears offense, stating that the addition of quarterback Jay Cutler had changed the team's identity. The Bears, who have historically employed a strong running game, were beginning to rely more on the pass on offense. He went on to say, \"Kyle Orton might not be the flashiest quarterback, but the guy is a winner, and that formula worked for us. I hate to say it, but that's the truth.\" Urlacher and Cutler later made amends. The Bears finished the season with a 7\u20139 record, and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year. After recovering from the injury, Urlacher stated, \"I feel more powerful. I'm running to the football, my keys are a lot more clear now, and I'm playing downhill... So I think it did help my body kind of calm down and relax a little bit. \" During the 2010 offseason, Bears general manager Jerry Angelo bolstered the team's defense by signing free agent Julius Peppers. With Peppers's help, Urlacher and the Bears improved to an 11\u20135 record in the 2010 NFL season, winning the NFC North and earning a first-round bye for the 2011 Playoffs. After leading the NFC in tackles (49) during the period, Urlacher was recognized as the NFC Defensive Player of the Month during December/January. It was the first time winning the award in his career. Urlacher was also voted to his seventh Pro Bowl for his stellar defensive efforts during the year. In 2011, in Week 17 against the Minnesota Vikings, Urlacher sprained his MCL when teammate Major Wright and Vikings receiver Percy Harvin landed on him with 5:15 left in the game. Urlacher was eventually named to the Pro Bowl, but did not play due to the injury against Minnesota. He missed much of the team's summer practice OTA's while trying to recover from the injury. On August 14, 2012, Urlacher had an arthroscopic debridement procedure on his left knee, and stated that his goal was to play in the 2012 season opener. He eventually practiced on September 3, and played against the Colts in the season opener, though he sat out the second half."

        "content": "Urlacher has two daughters, Pamela and Riley, with ex-wife Laurie Urlacher and a son, Kennedy, with Tyna Robertson. Urlacher currently lives with his daughters and has visitation rights with his son. His younger brother, Casey, had a brief career in the Arena Football League and was later elected mayor of Mettawa, Illinois in 2013. In June 2005, Urlacher filed suit to establish paternity of his son Kennedy. Genetic testing determined that he is Kennedy's father. Kennedy's mother, Tyna Robertson, was already well known to the media, having made claims of sexual assault against famed dancer Michael Flatley and a doctor from Naperville, Illinois. Urlacher and Robertson maintain joint-custody over Kennedy. In 2017, Urlacher appealed to a Cook County court to remove Kennedy from Robertson's custody after her husband, Ryan Karageorge, was shot and killed in their residence. In 2011, Urlacher's mother Lavoyda Lenard Urlacher died of unreported causes, and Urlacher was granted his temporary leave from the team. However, Urlacher was able to return to the team in time for the season opener. In April 2012, Urlacher began dating model and actress Jenny McCarthy. In August 2012, McCarthy announced that she and Urlacher had ended their relationship. Urlacher married Jennipher Frost, a former contestant on America's Next Top Model on March 13, 2016. He also enjoys golfing in his spare time, and during an episode of Home Turf, Urlacher revealed a room in his mansion containing a plethora of golf paraphernalia. When home, Urlacher revealed that he also enjoys watching the Discovery Channel, National Geographic, and HBO's Entourage. Urlacher enjoys listening to a wide variety of music, including hip hop, rock, and country music. Urlacher has also been spokesperson for several companies. Sega Sports selected Urlacher to appear on the cover of NFL 2K3, while other companies, such as Nike, McDonald's, Old Spice, and Vitamin Water, have featured him in several television advertisements and promotions. In 2014, Urlacher underwent a hair transplant surgery performed by RESTORE Hair. He became a spokesman for the Illinois-based clinic and appeared on billboards and television. Urlacher later sued a Florida-based hair transplant clinic for using his image and likeness without his consent. Urlacher is of Russian German descent. His great-grandfather, Lucas Urlacher, was born into a Black Sea German family in an area that today belongs to Ukraine."

        "content": "Anthony John Pierzynski (; born December 30, 1976) is an American former professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Minnesota Twins (1998\u20132003), San Francisco Giants (2004), Chicago White Sox (2005\u20132012), Texas Rangers (2013), Boston Red Sox (2014), St. Louis Cardinals (2014) and Atlanta Braves (2015\u20132016). Pierzynski is one of only ten catchers in Major League history to reach 2,000 hits in his career. Pierzynski is known for having a strong and colorful personality, a fact he acknowledges. During his turn at the microphone following the White Sox victory parade in 2005, he thanked team personnel for \"putting up\" with him. Former White Sox manager Ozzie Guill\u00e9n summed up the situation as, \"If you play against him, you hate him. If you play with him, you hate him a little less.\" Guill\u00e9n also acknowledged Pierzynski's value to the club, despite being relatively high-maintenance: \"A.J.'s been great for me. He's worth the work because he always shows up for you.\""

He was also selected by the Minnesota Twins in the third round (71st overall) of that year's MLB Draft and chose to sign with the ballclub on June 9. He began his minor league career with the Gulf Coast League Twins and spent the next four years playing for the minor-league Elizabethton Twins, Fort Wayne Wizards, Fort Myers Miracle, New Britain Rock Cats, and Salt Lake Buzz. After four years in the Twins organization, Pierzynski was called up to the major league team, and made his debut on September 9, 1998, when he was 21 years old. Two days later, he singled off  Billy Taylor for his first major league hit. He then spent the next five seasons, through the 2003 season, with Minnesota, though he was not a regular starter until 2001. From 1998 to 2000, Pierzynski appeared in just 49 games for the Twins. In 2002, he made the American League All-Star Team as a reserve catcher. In the 2002 American League Division Series, Pierzynski hit an important home run in the ninth inning of the final game, in which the Twins clinched the series. In 2003, Pierzynski attained a .312 batting average, a career-high."

        "title": "A. J. Pierzynski_Chicago White Sox",
        "content": "Pierzynski was signed as a free agent by the Chicago White Sox on January 6, 2005. When he signed with the White Sox, the San Francisco Chronicle ran a story claiming that the catcher had kneed Giants trainer Stan Conte in the groin during a spring training game in 2004. Although the incident allegedly happened during the game, it went unreported for nearly a year in the press. Pierzynski has disputed the allegations publicly. \"Don't you think if something like that happened, in spring training, you would have heard about it? I would have gotten in some sort of trouble?\" Pierzynski would hit 18 home runs, a new career-high, with his most memorable home run of the regular season coming on June 18, 2005, against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the bottom of the ninth to walk-off a 5\u20133 win. It was also memorable in that both teams were wearing their 1959 throwback jerseys to commemorate their meeting in the 1959 World Series. Pierzynski would help the White Sox go wire-to-wire in his first season with the team, winning the AL Central on September 29, 2005, in a win against the Detroit Tigers. However, Pierzynski's biggest contributions would come during the White Sox' 2005 playoff run. In the 2005 playoffs, Pierzynski was a major player for the White Sox. In Game 1 of the ALDS against the defending champion Red Sox, Pierzynski would start the White Sox off strong with a three-run homer in the first inning off  Matt Clement. He would add a second home run in the bottom of the eighth off Bronson Arroyo to help lead the White Sox to a  14\u20132 win. Pierzynski finished the game 3\u20133 with four RBIs. Pierzynski also hit a double and scored an insurance run in the top of the ninth inning as the White Sox defeated the Red Sox 5\u20133 to clinch the series and move on to the ALCS. Perhaps Pierzynski's biggest, and most well-known play, came in Game 2 of the ALCS against the then Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Down 0\u20131 in the series and the game tied at 1\u20131 in the bottom of the ninth inning, Pierzynski famously struck out on a low ball in the dirt from Kelvim Escobar. Thinking they had ended the inning, the Angels proceeded to walk off  the field; however, noting that home plate umpire Doug Eddings had not made the out call, Pierzynski ran down the line to first base and was called safe. Angels catcher Josh Paul and manager Mike Scioscia argued with Eddings but the call stood, and Pierzynski was replaced by Pablo Ozuna, who promptly stole second base. Joe Crede would end the game on a walk-off double to tie the series at 1-1. The White Sox did not lose again, winning the next three games in Anaheim to advance to their first World Series since 1959. The White Sox would then sweep the Houston Astros to win their first championship in 88 years, giving Pierzynski his first ring. Pierzynski batted .262 with 3 home runs and 9 RBI, catching all 11 games for the White Sox during their championship run. In 2006, Pierzynski was named one of the five American League players in the All-Star Final Vote. Soon afterwards the Chicago White Sox organization began an election campaign using the slogan \"Punch A.J.\". Pierzynski received 3.6 million votes, the most votes in the American League, subsequently sending him to his second All-Star appearance. The \"Punch A.J.\" campaign was inspired by an incident on May 20, 2006, between Pierzynski and Chicago Cubs catcher Michael Barrett. After a fly ball out, Pierzynski tagged up at third base and tried to score on the throw. After a collision at home, where Pierzynski knocked Barrett from his feet, Pierzynski slapped home plate with his hand. After getting up, Barrett grabbed Pierzynski and punched him in the face. A bench-clearing brawl ensued, and Pierzynski, Barrett, White Sox outfielder Brian Anderson and Cubs first baseman John Mabry were ejected. When play finally resumed, outfielder Scott Podsednik promptly got on base, loading the bases up, and second baseman Tadahito Iguchi cleared them with a grand-slam. The White Sox won the game, 7\u20130. Michael Barrett was suspended for 10 games, while Brian Anderson was suspended for five, and Pierzynski was fined. Pierzynski caught Mark Buehrle's no-hitter on April 18, 2007, but not his perfect game on July 23, 2009. He caught Philip Humber's perfect game on April 21, 2012, against the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field, as well. On May 28, 2007, in a game versus the Minnesota Twins, Pierzynski twice ran down the first base line with his feet on the inside of the base, possibly nipping Twins first baseman Justin Morneau with his spikes. Twins manager Ron Gardenhire was furious with the umpires, which resulted in a long tirade. However, he was not ejected. Pierzynski denied any attempt to step on Morneau. Pierzynski holds the AL record for consecutive errorless chances with 962, breaking Yogi Berra's previous record of 950, set in 1959. Pierzynski agreed to a two-year contract to remain with the White Sox after the 2010 season. On June 13, 2012, Pierzynski was rated the most hated MLB player. In 2012, Pierzynski homered in five consecutive games, tying the franchise record and becoming the sixth player to achieve this feat. His teammate Paul Konerko was the most recent Sox player to achieve this feat in 2011. Pierzynski had a career offensive year, winning a Silver Slugger Award at catcher, his first, while hitting .278/.326/.501 with 27 HR and 77 RBI."

On July 9, 2014, Pierzynski was designated for assignment and Christian V\u00e1zquez was promoted from AAA Pawtucket. A sports column in a Boston newspaper cited disgruntled anonymous Red Sox teammates who disliked Pierzynski, blaming him for the team's overall woes.

It was the pitcher's 150th career win. Pierzynski's first home run with St. Louis came in a loss to Baltimore on August 8.

After two mediocre seasons, Muhammad earned a starting role in 1998 and led the Panthers with 68 receptions, six touchdowns, and almost 1,000 yards. Muhammad enjoyed an outstanding season in 1999 under new head coach George Seifert and his 96 receptions, eight touchdowns, and 1,253 receiving yards led to his first Pro Bowl selection. His 102 receptions during the 2000 season tied for the NFL lead. Muhammad averaged over 1,000 yards each season from 1998 to 2000. Muhammad was injured for much of the 2001 NFL season, but he returned to form and eventually played a leading role in the Carolina Panthers' run to Super Bowl XXXVIII during 2003 NFL season. Though the Panthers lost to the AFC Champion New England Patriots 29\u201332, Muhammad recorded the longest touchdown reception (85 yards) in Super Bowl history. Muhammad's play during the 2004 season, where he led the NFL with a career-high 1,405 receiving yards and 16 receiving touchdowns, earned him his second Pro Bowl invitation. By the end of the season, Muhammad held all of the Panthers' receiving records, including catches (578), receiving yards (7,751), 100-yard games (26), and the top three single-game yardage totals (192, 189, 179). In addition, he tied Wesley Walls at 44 touchdown receptions. Muhammad, who was due a $10 million roster bonus, and the Panthers could not agree on a contract after the 2004 season, and the team released him in February 2005. Hours after his release, the Chicago Bears offered the 32-year-old a six-year contract, and Muhammad left Charlotte for Chicago. Muhammad's first stint with the Panthers was plagued with several negative experiences. He was the target of a racial slur from his quarterback, Kerry Collins; testified at murder hearings for Rae Carruth and Deidra Lane (wife of Fred Lane); and was arrested in 2003 on misdemeanor drug and weapon offenses."

He was also credited with encouraging a stronger work ethic within the team's receiving corps and advising young wide receivers such as Bernard Berrian, Mark Bradley, and Rashied Davis. Despite failing to catch several poorly thrown passes from rookie quarterback Kyle Orton, Muhammad held himself responsible and promised reporters he would improve his performance. However, Muhammad was later seen complaining to Orton during a Sunday Night Football game against the Atlanta Falcons. After Muhammad's criticism, coach Lovie Smith benched Orton in favor of a fully recovered Rex Grossman. Muhammad's statistics improved with Rex Grossman at quarterback in the 2006 season. He had his first one hundred-yard day with the Bears in their season opener against the Green Bay Packers, and a second against the Minnesota Vikings during Week 3. However, he saw less action as Grossman began to play inconsistently after the season's midway point. Muhammad defended Grossman from criticism and often supported him at press conferences. Muhammad finished the regular season as the team's leading wide receiver for the second consecutive time. Muhammad's age seemingly affected his endurance. Although he played all sixteen games in 2006, the Bears listed him as probable or questionable before many games. Before the 2006 season, he revealed he had played through the 2005 season with a broken hand. Muhammad had a down year in 2007, and the Bears released him on February 18, 2008. After leaving the Bears, Muhammad told Sports Illustrated Chicago is \"where wide receivers go to die.\" The remark caught the attention of Darryl Drake, the team's wide receiver coach. While Drake stated he was unfazed by Muhammad's remark, he argued former Bears wide receivers Bernard Berrian, Justin Gage, and Bobby Wade developed in Chicago and enjoyed successful careers after leaving."

He rebounded the first half of 2005, but in the second half, he had a slump brought on by a concussion. Through the first six weeks of the 2006 season, Williams was among the top receivers in the NFL. An ankle injury caused Byron Leftwich to miss the remainder of the season. After David Garrard became the starting quarterback, Williams' production slipped. Williams had his best game as a pro against the New Orleans Saints in Week 9 of the 2007 season, making six catches for 128 yards and one touchdown. His best professional season to date was in 2007, where he had 38 catches for 629 yards (an average of 16.6 yards per catch) and 10 touchdowns (more than twice his career total prior to 2007). In a game against the Oakland Raiders in Week 16, he broke the Jaguars' single season receiving touchdown record, with ten scores, record previously held by the retired Jimmy Smith."

        "content": "Hughes has played for the Philadelphia 76ers, Golden State Warriors, Washington Wizards, Cleveland Cavaliers, Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, Sacramento Kings, Charlotte Bobcats, and Orlando Magic. He was drafted by Philadelphia in the 1st round of the 1998 NBA draft out of Saint Louis University, where he was named Freshman of the Year. He is known for being a versatile and athletic guard with strong defensive abilities, and was selected to the 2004\u201305 NBA All-Defensive 1st Team as a member of the Wizards. He led the league in steals per game with 2.89 in 2004\u201305. Hughes participated in the 2000 Slam Dunk Contest in Oracle Arena (home of the Golden State Warriors) in Oakland, California. Hughes signed a five-year $70 million contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers as a free agent in the summer of 2005. He was brought into Cleveland to provide assistance to young superstar LeBron James, the Cavs' first overall draft pick in 2003. In the 2005\u201306 season he helped LeBron and the Cavs to an 18\u201310 record before requiring surgery on his broken finger. His last performance before the injury came in a 97\u201384 home upset of the Detroit Pistons, in which he scored 16 points on 7\u201310 shooting to go with two steals, five rebounds and three assists. Prior to injuries in 2005, he averaged 16.2 points, and 37.6 minutes per game. Both of those statistics were the second best on the team, to LeBron James.  He has an ongoing rivalry with former backcourt partner Gilbert Arenas, with whom he played for three seasons, two in Washington and one in Golden State. On May 2, 2006 Hughes was recipient of the inaugural Austin Carr Good Guy Award, designed to recognize the Cavaliers player who is cooperative and understanding of the media, the community and the public. On February 21, 2008, Hughes was traded to the Chicago Bulls, in a three-team trade, along with Drew Gooden, Cedric Simmons and Shannon Brown in exchange for Ben Wallace and Joe Smith. On February 19, 2009 just before the trade deadline, Hughes was traded from the Bulls to the New York Knicks for Tim Thomas, Jerome James, and Anthony Roberson. On February 18, 2010, Hughes was traded to the Sacramento Kings in a three team deal that also moved Tracy McGrady to the Knicks. He was waived by the Kings on February 23, 2010. On March 13, 2010, he signed with the Charlotte Bobcats for the rest of the season. On December 9, 2011, Hughes signed a non-guaranteed contract with the Orlando Magic. He was waived on February 1, 2012, after averaging 1.3 points in nine games. Hughes was selected to play in Ice Cube's BIG3 League on the \"Killer 3s\" team in the summer of 2017."

He was the only kicker to be taken during the draft and moved across the bay to join the San Francisco 49ers.  Brien struggled during his rookie year, converting 15 of 20 field goals (20th of 28 qualified kickers) and 60 of 62 PATs (19th of 24 qualified kickers) for the 49ers.  The 49ers, led by Steve Young, went on to win Super Bowl XXIX over the San Diego Chargers by a score of 49\u201326, a game in which Brien missed his only field goal attempt, a 47-yard try before halftime.  Brien nonetheless set the record for most PATs during a single postseason with 17 (on 18 attempts) en route to earning a Super Bowl ring that season.  Brien also had a fumble recovery during the NFC Championship game. The following year, Brien made only 58% of his field goals for San Francisco, and was cut after missing a potential game-winning field goal against the Indianapolis Colts. He signed a few weeks later with the New Orleans Saints. Brien went on to play a total of 12 seasons in the NFL for 7 different organizations including 6 seasons with the Saints.  He was elected a team captain as well as the NFLPA player rep for the Saints.  Over the course of his career, Brien was regarded as one of the most reliable kickers in the league.  One huge exception to this was during the 2004 Divisional Playoff game in Pittsburgh against the Steelers.  Brien missed two 4th-quarter field goals from 47 and 43 yards which would have won the game for the New York Jets.  At the time of his retirement, he was one of the 10 most accurate field goal kickers of all time, and currently ranks 54th. During his career, Brien converted 80.2% of field goals and 98% of PATs.  Brien accounted for 915 points over his 12-year career and has a career long make from 56 yards."

In 1989, Norton and Jesse Solomon shared the weakside linebacker position. He played the first and third quarters, Solomon the second and fourth. In 1990, he became a full-time starter when Solomon held out and was eventually traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. A knee injury sidelined him for the last two games of the season. In 1991, he bounced back from knee surgery and was used at strongside linebacker and middle linebacker during that season, eventually settling in at the middle linebacker spot. In 1992, he blossomed as a player and became the leader of the defense, leading the team in tackles with 120 and helping the Cowboys win their first Super Bowl in the 1990s. That year the Cowboys had the number one defense in the league, but no player was voted to the Pro Bowl. He also started doing his trademarked punching of the goal posts or the air, after making good plays. A tribute to his father, the one time boxing heavyweight champion of the world, Ken Norton. In 1993, he had to play through a torn biceps injury, but still managed to lead the team in tackles with 159, helping the Cowboys win their second straight Super Bowl. He was also selected to his first Pro Bowl. Norton played in Dallas between 1988 and 1993, assisting the Cowboys to victory in Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII. Norton scored a touchdown on a fumble recovery in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XXVII, helping to seal a Cowboys victory. In 1994 when a salary cap was instituted in the NFL, the Cowboys organization felt they could find linebackers through the draft, without the need of paying a premium and adversely impacting the salary cap, so they allowed talented and productive players like Ken Norton Jr., Darrin Smith, Dixon Edwards, and Robert Jones to leave via free agency, instead of signing them into long-term contracts."

Norton is also notable for his part in ending the career of Napoleon McCallum.  In the first game of the 1994 season, Norton, along with Bryant Young, tackled McCallum during a rushing play.  While he was being pulled to the ground, McCallum's knee collapsed backwards into an unnatural position, almost at a 90 degree angle. After the play, Norton remained under McCallum while medical staff attended to McCallum. Norton finished his 13 NFL seasons with 12 sacks and 5 interceptions, which he returned for 127 yards and 2 touchdowns (both in the same game against the St. Louis Rams in 1995). He also recovered 13 fumbles and returned them for 36 yards. Along with ex-teammate Deion Sanders, Norton won consecutive Super Bowls on different teams.

Lewis played 200 games as a Jet, the third-longest tenure in franchise history, and was one of the most loved team players and captains of his time. He was a three-time Pro Bowler (1998, 1999, 2000), was the Jets' defensive captain from 1997 to 2003 and was named to the NFL All-Pro team after the 1998 season. Lewis retired after the 2003 season with 1,231 tackles (883 solo), 52.5 sacks, 14 interceptions for 241 yards, 79 pass deflections, 29 forced fumbles, 13 fumble recoveries for 74 yards and five defensive touchdowns in 200 career games."

        "content": "While Lewis had a productive career, he is best known for being the catalyst for starting the New England Patriots dynasty that would span two decades.  During an early-season game against the Patriots, Lewis leveled Patriots' quarterback Drew Bledsoe with a hard, but clean hit. Bledsoe was about to dive for the first-down marker, but defensive end Shaun Ellis clipped Bledsoe's ankles, resulting in Bledsoe taking the full force of the hit while standing straight up. Tom Brady, a sixth-round draft pick in the 2000 NFL Draft, was the back-up quarterback and finished the game. It turned out that Lewis' hit sheared a blood vessel in Bledsoe's chest, causing Bledsoe to lose a pint of blood an hour. Bledsoe would never regain his starting job (he was traded to Buffalo after the season), The Patriots went 11-3 for the remainder of the season, culminating in the team's first Super Bowl title on February 3, 2002. Over the next two decades, the Patriots would win six Super Bowl titles and Brady would win a seventh in Tampa Bay. As a result, Lewis' hit on Bledsoe is often noted for its impact on NFL history. The hit appeared on the NFL's list of 100 greatest game changers, ranking at 82."

During his playing career as a midfielder, he played for Swiss clubs Schaffhausen, Z\u00fcrich and Aarau before joining Lazio of Italy and Chelsea of England. Born in Switzerland to Italian parents, he was capped 34 times for Italy, scoring two goals, and played in UEFA Euro 1996 and the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He retired as a player in February 2002 at the age of 31 following injury problems. Di Matteo began his managerial career with Milton Keynes Dons, who he took to the League One playoffs in 2008\u201309 before leaving to return West Bromwich Albion to the Premier League. As caretaker manager of Chelsea, he steered the club to double title success, winning both the FA Cup and the club's first UEFA Champions League title in 2012, but was dismissed later that year. He then went on to coach Schalke 04 until May 2015 when he departed after seven months in charge, and had four months as manager of Aston Villa in 2016."

Under Zeman, he was frequently deployed in the central midfield role, in which he was required to aid the team defensively, thanks to his formation as a sweeper during his youth. He was also important in helping his team offensively and creatively, functioning as a deep-lying playmaker for Lazio under Zeman, and helping to set the tempo of his team's play through his passing range, technique, control, and vision. During his time at the club, he developed into one of the top two-way central midfielders in Italy."

        "content": "Di Matteo scored the winner against Middlesbrough on his home debut for Chelsea. His passing ability and accurate long-distance shooting saw him become one of the driving forces of Chelsea's resurgence in the late 1990s. He contributed nine goals in his first season, including long-range efforts against both Tottenham Hotspur and Wimbledon. He helped the club finish sixth place in the league, their highest placing since 1989\u201390, and reach the 1997 FA Cup Final at Wembley. Within 42 seconds of the kick-off of the final against Middlesbrough, Di Matteo scored the opening goal from 30 yards and Chelsea won 2\u20130. Di Matteo's goal was the fastest in a Wembley FA Cup final until the record was broken by Louis Saha for Everton in 2009. The following season Di Matteo again proved his worth to the team, contributing ten goals and numerous assists, as Chelsea went on to claim the Football League Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup, their first European honour since 1971. In the League Cup final, again against Middlesbrough, Di Matteo scored the second goal in a 2\u20130 win. Di Matteo played in midfield next to Gustavo Poyet, Dennis Wise and Dan Petrescu in the 1998\u201399 season as Chelsea finished third. During the 1999\u20132000 season Di Matteo was sidelined by injury but returned late in the season to score a handful of crucial goals, including his third Cup-winning goal at Wembley, once again in the FA Cup. In a dour match, Di Matteo capitalised on an error by Aston Villa goalkeeper David James to score the winner in the 72nd minute, handing Chelsea their fourth major trophy in three years. This led Di Matteo to comment on the old Wembley Stadium saying \"It's a shame they're tearing the old place down it has been a very lucky ground for me\". Early into the 2000\u201301 season, Di Matteo sustained a triple leg fracture in a UEFA Cup tie against Swiss side St. Gallen and did not play for the next eighteen months. He gave up on hopes of returning from this injury in February 2002 and retired at the age of 31. In his six years at Chelsea, Di Matteo made 175 appearances and scored 26 goals."

Di Matteo started his stewardship of Chelsea in winning form, with victories over Birmingham City, in a fifth round FA Cup match; Stoke City in a Premier League fixture; and Napoli in the last 16 second leg match in the UEFA Champions League, winning 4\u20131 to overturn the deficit in the first leg which Villas-Boas' Chelsea had lost 3\u20131. Di Matteo continued his form with Chelsea, by beating Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup semi-final 5\u20131 at Wembley and Benfica in the Champions League quarter-finals. On 24 April 2012, Di Matteo led Chelsea to a 3\u20132 aggregate win over holders Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League semi-final, winning 1\u20130 in the first leg at Stamford Bridge, and following this with a 2\u20132 draw in the second leg at the Camp Nou despite having captain John Terry sent off in the first half.

Chief executive Ron Gourlay said: 'Although he (Di Matteo) has set the bar very high in the short time he has been in charge, we know that Roberto is the right man to lead Chelsea onto further success.' Gourlay added: 'We are already looking forward to the 2012\u201313 season which kicks off when Roberto, his staff and players return for pre-season.' Chelsea lost in the 2012 FA Community Shield to Manchester City 2\u20133. His team started the 2012\u201313 Premier League well, with victories against Wigan Athletic, Reading, and Newcastle United. They lost the 2012 UEFA Super Cup 4\u20131 to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in Monaco on 1 September. The good early season form continued with four successive Premier League wins against Stoke City, Arsenal, Norwich City and Tottenham Hotspur.

Chelsea's chances of advancing through their Champions League group were raised with a 3\u20132 home victory against leaders Shakhtar, but on 21 November 2012, Di Matteo was sacked following their 3\u20130 away loss to Juventus in the Champions League, which all but eliminated them from the competition. Di Matteo had lasted just eight months as manager of Chelsea despite winning two major trophies, causing the decision to be controversial with many pundits and club fans. Later that day, Rafael Ben\u00edtez was brought in as Chelsea's interim manager until the end of the season. In November 2013, it was reported that Di Matteo was still being paid \u00a3130,000-a-week by Chelsea because the two parties had never agreed on a pay-off settlement and that he would continue to be paid in full until June 2014 unless he took another job before then."

He played college football at Utah, where he was recognized as an All-American and led his team to victory in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl. Following his collegiate success, he was selected first overall by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2005 NFL Draft. Smith struggled with consistency and injuries until 2011 when he led the 49ers to their first NFC West division title and playoff win since 2002, along with their first NFC Championship Game appearance since 1997. The next year, however, a concussion resulted in Smith losing his starting position to backup Colin Kaepernick. He was subsequently traded to the Kansas City Chiefs, where he guided them to four playoff runs between 2013 and 2017 and one postseason victory in 2015, their first since 1993. Smith also received three Pro Bowl selections during his Chiefs tenure and led the league in passer rating for 2017. Smith was traded to the Washington Redskins in 2018 to make way for Kansas City's second-year quarterback Patrick Mahomes; in the 2017 season Smith had been considered instrumental in developing Mahomes who would be named the 2018 NFL MVP. During his first season with Washington, Smith suffered a life-threatening injury to his right leg that nearly resulted in amputation. Although expected to never play again, Smith completed a lengthy rehabilitation process that allowed him to return in 2020. He became Washington's starter midway through the season, leading the team to an NFC East division title and earning him NFL Comeback Player of the Year. Smith retired after he was released by Washington during the 2021 offseason and joined ESPN as an NFL analyst later that year. His comeback from injury is cited as among the greatest in NFL history."

Smith, was an executive director at Helix High School, which he attended. As a starter for the Helix Highlanders during his junior and senior years, Smith led his team to a record of 25\u20131, including two San Diego CIF section championships. He was named to the first-team all-conference and all-county squads in the San Diego CIF system. Smith also earned the conference offensive player of the year twice, and twice won the team MVP for Helix. During his time at Helix, Smith set a school record by throwing for six touchdowns in one game, and recorded the second-highest completion percentage in San Diego CIF history. While at Helix, he played with 2005 Heisman Trophy-winner (since vacated) Reggie Bush. Smith and Bush were later finalists for the 2004 Heisman, making it the first time a high school had two finalists at the same ceremony. Smith was president of his senior class in high school, earned college credits through a program with San Diego State University and took a dozen Advanced Placement tests."

Nolan also evaluated California quarterback Aaron Rodgers, but did not believe that Rodgers's attitude could co-exist with him. Smith was the first overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, selected by the San Francisco 49ers. In July 2005, Smith agreed to a six-year, $49.5 million contract with the 49ers; the contract included $24 million in guaranteed money. Dealing with an injury and being taken in and out of the lineup by head coach Mike Nolan, Smith played in nine games in his rookie season, recording just one touchdown pass while throwing 11 interceptions."

        "content": "After the challenges faced by his rookie campaign, Smith went into the 2006 season with a new offensive coordinator (Norv Turner) and an improved set of offensive weapons around him. The 49ers used their top draft choice on tight end Vernon Davis. They also upgraded their offensive backfield, trading underachieving running back Kevan Barlow to the Jets, making Frank Gore the feature back. Smith also spent the off-season working daily with his new coordinator, wide receivers and tight end, while working to improve his technique and add bulk. The improved offensive cast clearly helped Smith develop in his second year, especially early. Smith's first three games of the season saw him throw three touchdowns, no interceptions, and amass 814\u00a0yards. After struggling in Kansas City, he then threw for three touchdowns against the Oakland Raiders, setting a career-high. However, the next five games saw Smith resume his growing pains, averaging only 153\u00a0yards per game while throwing only six touchdowns and nine interceptions. Despite his difficulty, he led the 49ers on a three-game winning streak in November. Smith met Joe Montana for the first time on November 5, 2006, during a game against the Vikings. The 49ers wore the throwback jerseys of the 1989 team which Joe Montana and teammates wore. The 49ers went on to win 9\u20133, upsetting the Minnesota Vikings. In need of a statement game, the 49ers traveled to Seattle for a Thursday Night Football game against their division rivals. During the broadcast on NFL Network, Cris Collinsworth noted that if he were starting an NFL franchise, he would have taken the Broncos rookie quarterback Jay Cutler before Alex Smith and fellow rookies Matt Leinart and Vince Young \u2013 and that Smith was not even close to the others. Going into the 4th quarter, the 49ers were trailing the Seahawks 7\u20133, and pulling out a win looked unlikely. Smith however performed brilliantly in the fourth quarter, and drove the 49ers on a long touchdown drive down the field early, taking a narrow 10\u20137 lead. Late in the quarter, with the same score, Smith struck again \u2013 shaking off an almost certain sack, rolling to the left and completing a pass to Frank Gore for a touchdown to give the 49ers a 10-point lead. On the next drive, Smith cemented the victory by leading yet another touchdown drive, and rushing for a touchdown on a naked bootleg. Collinsworth had earlier in the game observed that \"Alex Smith is the best I've ever seen him. That drive is the best I saw,\" and on seeing his touchdown run, commented \"What a second-half he has had!\" After losing to the Cardinals the following week, the 49ers' final game of the 2006 season was against a Denver Broncos team looking for a playoff berth. In a major upset, the 49ers defeated the Broncos and knocked them out of the playoffs. During the game at INVESCO Field, Smith threw for 194\u00a0yards and a touchdown, leading the team to a come from behind victory for the second time in three weeks. Overall, Smith improved in his second year by throwing as many touchdowns as interceptions. He threw for 16 touchdowns, 16 interceptions, 2,890\u00a0yards, and a 74.8 quarterback rating, all improvements over his rookie year. He became the first 49ers quarterback in club history to take every snap from center over the course of a season in 2006."

        "content": "Smith entered the 2007 season learning under a third offensive coordinator in three seasons. Norv Turner was hired as the head coach by the San Diego Chargers. Jim Hostler replaced Turner. Hostler's system involved a mixture of the offensive system installed by Turner with elements of the West Coast offense installed by Mike McCarthy for the 2005 season. During the off-season, the 49ers added wide receivers Darrell Jackson, Ashley Lelie, and rookie Jason Hill as new offensive targets for Smith. In the season opener on Monday Night Football against the Arizona Cardinals, Smith led the 49ers to a 20\u201317 win in a two-minute comeback. While down 17\u201313 with less than two minutes left, Smith drove down the field, highlighted by a 25-yard scramble. After the scramble, he threw a 22-yard pass to Arnaz Battle that was fumbled on the one-yard line, but recovered by a 49er so the ball was placed back on the one-yard line with 26 seconds left. The following play, Battle ran an end-around for the game-winning touchdown. Smith finished the game 15 for 31 with 126\u00a0yards and two rushes for 37\u00a0yards. On September 30 in the first quarter of a game against the Seattle Seahawks, Smith injured his right shoulder after getting sacked by Seahawks defensive tackle Rocky Bernard. Smith suffered a grade-three separation and the initial diagnosis was that surgery would not be required. Smith missed the next three games before returning to the 49ers' starting lineup on Sunday, October 28, 2007. The 49ers did not win another game until November 25. Among all NFL quarterbacks who qualify for league statistics, only the Jets' Kellen Clemens had a poorer passer rating than Smith (57.2), Smith completed under 50% of his passes, far below the league average of 60%. Smith was at odds with 49ers head coach Mike Nolan over the severity of his injury. Nolan publicly implied that Smith was not fighting through the injury, while Smith felt that the injury still affected his ability to throw accurately, an account that was supported by players from the Seahawks. Nolan decided to rest Smith following a loss in that game to the Seahawks on November 12 and start Trent Dilfer to allow Smith's shoulder to recover. Following the decision, orthopedic surgeon James Andrews said that upon further examination the shoulder did not heal as significantly as Andrews thought it would, and on December 11, 2007, Smith was placed on injured reserve to undergo surgery on the shoulder, ending his season."

        "content": "Smith entered training camp competing for the starting quarterback job with Shaun Hill, who won both of the games he started in 2007, before suffering a back injury against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and journeyman J. T. O'Sullivan. Smith would be learning under a fourth different offensive coordinator in four seasons; Jim Hostler was fired and replaced by former Detroit Lions offensive coordinator and St. Louis Rams offensive coordinator/head coach Mike Martz. Unlike the previous three seasons, where offensive continuity was somewhat maintained, Martz's system was completely different. Smith lost the starting job in training camp to O'Sullivan, who was elevated to starting quarterback, partly due to his familiarity with Martz's offense when he was a member of the Detroit Lions. On September 10, the 49ers placed Smith on injured reserve after Dr. James Andrews confirmed the team's diagnosis of a broken bone in his shoulder, believed to have been caused by a wire left in his shoulder from the previous surgery, which had sawed through the bone. Regardless, the 49ers' general manager, Scot McCloughan, said that the 49ers expected to release Smith before the 2009 season, when they would owe him a salary of $9,625,000. After Nolan was fired on October 20, 2008, the 49ers expressed interest in having Smith remain for the 2009 season if he was willing to renegotiate his contract. On March 10, 2009, the 49ers announced that his contract had been successfully restructured and that he would stay with the team. He took a considerable pay cut to remain with the 49ers, with whom he would be under contract for the next two years. Smith was to make $4 million a season in 2009 and 2010, in addition to base salaries that were not immediately made known. In his previous contract, he was scheduled to make $24.6 million in the final two years."

        "content": "After the pay cut, Smith said that he was ready to compete for the starting quarterback spot, primarily against Shaun Hill. Mike Singletary became the head coach after a successful term as the interim head coach in 2008, and Martz was fired as offensive coordinator due to the huge differences in offensive philosophies between himself and Singletary. Jimmy Raye II was hired to replace him, marking Smith's fifth different offensive coordinator in five seasons. During the off-season, the 49ers drafted Michael Crabtree to be the featured receiver that Smith had been lacking throughout his NFL career. After restructuring his contract with San Francisco, Smith lost the battle for the starting quarterback position to Shaun Hill. However, in a Week 7 game against the Houston Texans, Smith replaced Hill in the third quarter, after Hill had performed poorly and the Niners faced a 21\u20130 first-half deficit. Smith led the team back with three touchdown passes, all to tight end Vernon Davis, but fell short of victory, 24\u201321. Singletary named Smith as the 49ers' starting quarterback the next day at his weekly press conference on October 26. After his return as the 49ers' starting quarterback, Smith displayed signs of progress, despite the team's 3\u20134 record in his first seven starts. He led the 49ers to a Week 12 victory, 20\u20133, against the visiting Jacksonville Jaguars, throwing for 232 yards with two touchdown passes while posting a 96.8 passer rating. In a Week 13 match-up against the NFC West division rival Seattle Seahawks, he recorded the first 300-yard passing game of his career, completing 27 of 45 throws with two touchdown passes. Overall, he finished the season with 2,350 passing yards, 18 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions as the 49ers finished with an 8\u20138 record."

        "content": "Smith entered the 2010 season as the starting quarterback. For the first time in his career, he returned under the same offensive coordinator from the previous season, as Raye was retained. However, continuity in a poor system resulted in the team starting 0\u20135, and on September 27, Raye was fired and replaced by quarterbacks coach Mike Johnson. Under Johnson, Smith was expected to run a variation of the spread offense that he ran in college. The 49ers continued to build their team having now drafted Anthony Davis and Mike Iupati with their two first-round picks to provide more protection. On September 8, Coach Singletary announced that Smith was named one of the team's captains. In Week 5, Smith was booed at home and the crowd chanted for his backup, David Carr, before leading the 49ers to two scoring drives to close within three points. However, he was hit as he threw on the third drive attempt, resulting in an interception and a 24\u201327 loss, dropping the 49ers to 0\u20135. Smith once again suffered an injured shoulder in the 49ers week 7 game against the Carolina Panthers and was not available to play Week 8 against the Denver Broncos in London. He was replaced by Troy Smith, who had 14 games of experience in the NFL before joining the 49ers organization just before the start of the regular season. Troy Smith took Smith's position after winning two straight games against the St. Louis Rams and the Denver Broncos. However, following a loss to the Green Bay Packers in Week 13 that left the 49ers with a 4\u20138 record, Troy Smith was demoted to backup in favor of Alex Smith. Smith would start against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 14 in a game the 49ers needed to win to stay in contention in the NFC West. Smith acknowledged that his performances needed to be more consistent. On December 12, 2010, the 49ers played the Seahawks in San Francisco. Smith was booed by the Candlestick crowd after the first two plays. However, the boos turned to cheers after Smith helped lead the 49ers to a 40\u201321 victory over a division rival. The win moved the 49ers one game behind the division leaders (Rams and Seahawks) with three games left to play. However, the 49ers struggled the following Thursday night against the San Diego Chargers and Troy Smith started the following game against the Rams. Troy Smith struggled in the loss to the Rams and Alex relieved Troy Smith in that game. After the game, Singletary was fired and Alex finished the season starting against the Cardinals. The 49ers finished the season 6\u201310 and Smith became a free agent after the season. After his firing, Singletary said, \"You gotta have a quarterback.\" Smith had won just 19\u00a0games in 50\u00a0career starts through 2010. In 2010, he was chosen as the 11th-smartest athlete in sports by Sporting News."

        "content": "The 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh as the new head coach, and Greg Roman replaced Johnson as the new offensive coordinator. Harbaugh, a former quarterback, was the best teacher the 49ers had since Norv Turner in Smith's second season. Harbaugh made it known to Smith that he was welcomed back on the team. Smith's family wanted him to leave San Francisco. Although he was unsigned, Smith organized the players' workouts during the 2011 NFL lockout and helped to install Harbaugh's new offense. After the lockout ended, Smith signed a one-year $5 million contract with the 49ers. Smith was named the starting quarterback heading into the regular season, and Harbaugh believed Smith could succeed in the coach's West Coast offense. During the season, Smith's game showed marked improvement, especially in his leadership and intangibles. While he did not put up big numbers, he helped the 49ers win games through efficient play, minimizing mistakes and controlling the clock. In a road game against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 4, Smith rallied the team from a 23\u20133 second-half deficit to win 24\u201323, completing 9 of 9 passes for 179 yards and two touchdowns in the third quarter alone. Two weeks later, Smith led his third come-from-behind road victory of the year with a six-yard fourth and goal touchdown pass to tight end Delanie Walker, beating the Lions in Detroit 25\u201319. In a week 10 matchup against the New York Giants, he completed 19 out of 30 passes for 242 yards. The Giants shut down the 49ers' run game (Frank Gore was held to zero yards on six carries before leaving the game in the second half) and Smith was instrumental in the 27\u201320 victory. By the time the 2011 season was finished, Smith had helped lead the 49ers to a 13\u20133 record in the regular season, including five come-from-behind victories in which four were on the road, and the 49ers earned a first-round bye in the playoffs. After 3 head coaches, 7 offensive coordinators, and 17 different starting wide receivers in the span of 7 seasons with the 49ers, Smith would finally make his first playoff appearance. While the 49ers finished with their most wins since 1997, they did it while ranked 29th of 32 teams in the NFL in total passing yardage for 2011 (including yardage lost from sacks), and Smith was often cynically referred to as a game manager. In this manner, The New York Times wrote that Smith was \"a steady, if unspectacular, player surrounded by a solid team\" in 2011, whose career year \"underscored how much he struggled previously.\" It was his first season with over 3,000 yards passing, and he set personal single-season highs in virtually every relevant statistical category commonly cited for quarterbacks: in pass attempts with 445, in completions with 273, in completion percentage with 61.3\u00a0percent, in passing yards with 3,144, in average per pass with 7.1 yards per attempt, in overall passer rating with 90.7, in rushing attempts with 52, in rushing yards with 179, and in total touchdowns scored with 19 (17 passing & 2 rushing), all while being sacked a league-high 44 times. He also threw a league-low 5 interceptions in 2011, breaking a 49ers franchise record, and setting yet another personal single-season best in fewest passes intercepted per attempt with a 1.123\u00a0percent interception rate, likewise the lowest percentage in the league that year. In the NFC Divisional round of the playoffs, Smith led the 49ers to a win over the New Orleans Saints, with a final score of 36\u201332. Smith threw for 299 yards, three touchdown passes, and no interceptions while rushing for an additional touchdown. Smith led touchdown drives of 80 and 85 yards in the final 4:02. He scored on a 28-yard touchdown run, and he threw a game-winning 14-yard touchdown pass to Vernon Davis with nine seconds remaining, eschewing a more conservative open receiver that would have settled for a field goal and a tie. Analyst Ron Jaworski said \"Alex Smith won the game, not Alex Smith by not making mistakes. His performance won the game for them.\" Smith also became the first quarterback in NFL playoff history to lead two go-ahead touchdowns in the final 3 minutes of a game. The 49ers lost 20\u201317 in overtime to the New York Giants in the NFC Championship Game. Smith completed 12 of 26\u00a0passes for 196\u00a0yards and two touchdowns, but the team turned the ball over twice on special teams. Smith was chosen by teammates as winner of the Ed Block Courage Award, annually awarded to the player that exemplifies a commitment to sportsmanship and courage. Smith made the USA Today All-Joe Team, an award which is given to the best players not to make the Pro Bowl."

The 49ers were reported to be interested in signing Peyton Manning, who had just been released by the rebuilding Indianapolis Colts, leading Smith to visit the Miami Dolphins, reportedly with the intent to sign with the Dolphins if the 49ers signed Manning. Shortly after Manning made the decision to join the Denver Broncos, Smith signed a three-year contract worth $24 million to remain with the 49ers. During the off-season, the 49ers added wide receivers Randy Moss and Mario Manningham in free agency, and A. J. Jenkins in the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft to improve a passing game that lacked production from the receivers the previous season. Smith began the 2012 season as the 49ers' starting quarterback. Smith completed 18-of-19 passes for 232 yards and three touchdowns without an interception in a 24\u20133 Monday night win over Arizona, and San Francisco was 6\u20132 after eight games. In the following game against the St. Louis Rams, Smith suffered a concussion in the second quarter, throwing a touchdown with blurred vision before exiting the game. He was replaced by Colin Kaepernick, and the game ended in a 24\u201324 tie. Smith missed the following game, and Kaepernick was 16 for 23 for 243 yards with two touchdowns in a 32\u20137 win over the Chicago Bears. Harbaugh was impressed with Kaepernick, and said \"we have two quarterbacks that have a hot hand\" while dismissing any rule that a player should not lose their starting job due to an injury. A quarterback controversy began. Smith was ranked third in the NFL in passer rating (104.1), led the league in completion percentage (70%), and had been 19\u20135\u20131 as a starter under Harbaugh, while Kaepernick was considered more dynamic with his scrambling ability and arm strength. Smith was medically cleared to play the day before the following game, but Harbaugh chose not to rush him back and again started Kaepernick, who threw and ran for a touchdown in a 31\u201321 win over the New Orleans Saints. The following week, Harbaugh announced that Kaepernick would start for the 8\u20132\u20131 49ers, while also stating that the assignment was week-to-week and not necessarily permanent. However, Kaepernick remained the starter as the 49ers again qualified for the playoffs. Harbaugh stated that Smith had been more of a coach to Kaepernick later into the 2012 season than even he was. Before losing the starting quarterback job, Smith was on pace to set career highs in completion percentage, passing yards, yards-per-attempt, passing touchdowns and rushing yards. Smith was named to the USA Today All Joe Team for the second year in a row, and was also named the captain of the team."

The deal became official at the beginning of the new league year on March 12. After the trade became official, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid stated that Smith would be the starting quarterback for the 2013 season. Smith's job as the starter was solidified during OTA's (Organized Team Activities, a term usually referring to NFL pre-season activities). According to coaches and teammates, Smith displayed a very high \"football IQ,\" and his accuracy in passing was lauded as the best many had ever seen. According to Kansas City's quarterbacks coach, Smith was \"super intelligent\" and had all of the intangibles that he looked for in a quarterback. The Chiefs were the last unbeaten team in the 2013 NFL season with Smith winning his first nine regular-season starts, gaining 1,919 passing yards with nine touchdowns compared to four interceptions. Smith earned his first and only perfect passer rating on December 15, 2013. He was 17 of 20, with 287 yards and 5 touchdowns, four of them going to Jamaal Charles, in a victory over the Oakland Raiders. Alex Smith and the Chiefs lost to Andrew Luck and the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Wild-Card Playoff Game on January 4, 2014. Smith threw four touchdowns, completing 30 of his 46 pass attempts for 378 yards and no interceptions, while also carrying the ball 8 times for 57 yards. However, he did commit his team's only turnover, losing a fumble. The final score of the game was 45\u201344 in favor of the Colts. Smith was elected to his first Pro Bowl at the end of the season as a replacement for Tom Brady. In the game, Smith led all quarterbacks in yards, tied for most touchdowns, and led the game-winning touchdown drive at the end of the game that resulted in him throwing a touchdown pass to DeMarco Murray for a 22\u201321 win."

However, the performance was overshadowed as defensive penalties and errors proved to be costly as the Chiefs lost on the road by a score of 38\u201331. With his performance against the Jets, Smith became the first player in the modern era to have both a 70-yard pass and a 70-yard run in the same game. With a playoff spot already secured, Smith was given a rest in Week 17, and Chiefs' 2017 first round pick Patrick Mahomes made his NFL debut against the Denver Broncos. Smith finished the 2017 regular season with 4,042 passing yards and 26 touchdowns, both career highs. He was named an alternate for the Pro Bowl, eventually replacing the injured Philip Rivers. Overall, in the 2017 season, Smith finished with 4,042 passing yards (8th in the NFL), 26 touchdowns, five interceptions, and a league-leading 104.7 passer rating. In the Wild Card Round against the Tennessee Titans, Smith had 264 passing yards and two touchdowns in the narrow 22\u201321 defeat. He was also credited as being instrumental in the development of Mahomes."

        "content": "During a game against the Houston Texans on November 18, 2018, Smith suffered a spiral and compound fracture to his tibia and fibula in his right leg when he was sacked by Kareem Jackson and J. J. Watt. The injury drew parallels to former Washington quarterback Joe Theismann, who also broke his leg in a game 33\u00a0years to the day prior in 1985 and retired shortly thereafter. Theismann was also present during the game and witnessed the injury. Following the initial surgery, Smith developed life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis that resulted in sepsis which required him to undergo 17 surgeries, including eight debridements, across four separate hospital stays over a period of nine months. Doctors had suggested that an amputation above the knee might be his only option before performing skin grafts and an operation transferring muscle from his left quadriceps to save it. As a part of his recovery process, Smith wore an external fixation device for nearly a year. He was placed on the team's physically unable to perform (PUP) reserve list in 2019, missing the entire season. Despite the severity of the injury which many thought he would never come back from, in early 2020 he affirmed his intent to return. An ESPN documentary following his recovery, Project 11, aired in May 2020. He was cleared by his doctors to resume football activities in July 2020, with the team placing him on the physically unable to perform list to begin training camp before being activated on August 16, 2020."

He entered the game after Kyle Allen left with an arm injury and finished with nine completions for 37 yards while being sacked six times as Washington lost 30\u201310. Smith made his next appearance in Week 9 after Allen left the game with a dislocated ankle, where he threw for 325 yards with a touchdown and three interceptions in a 23\u201320 loss against the New York Giants. Smith started against the Detroit Lions the following week, where he threw 55 times for 38 completions and 390 yards, all career highs, in a 30\u201327 road loss. The following week, Smith had his first win since the injury in a 20\u20139 game against the Cincinnati Bengals. During Week 13 against the 11\u20130 Pittsburgh Steelers, he helped lead Washington to a 23\u201317 upset victory with 296 passing yards and a touchdown. The following week, he was pulled out of a game against the San Francisco 49ers due to a bone bruise in his right leg, reported at the time as calf soreness, and subsequently missed the rest of that game and the next two. Smith returned for the regular-season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles, throwing for 162 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 20\u201314 victory as Washington clinched the NFC East. However, he did not play in the Wild Card playoff 31-23 loss against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers due to lingering issues with his bone bruise. Following the season, Smith was named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year by the Associated Press, Sporting News, and Pro Football Writers of America. Smith was released by the team on March 5, 2021."

To honor him, Smith, his brother, and his father are each tattooed with four firesteels, the traditional Serbian cross. Smith's uncle, John L. Smith, was a college football head coach until 2018, and his cousin, Chris Shelton, is a former Major League Baseball player. In 2014, Smith was awarded an honorary doctor of humane letters degree by the University of Utah, where he also delivered the commencement speech for the graduating class. He married former Oakland Raiders cheerleader Elizabeth Barry in 2009. They have two sons and a daughter. In 2007, Smith founded the Alex Smith Foundation and the Alex Smith Guardian Scholars Program, which helps send foster teens to college. He started the program with $500,000, and continues to personally fund the majority of the charity. The Boston Globe held up Smith's foundation as a model charity that properly allocated its funding, noting that it raised over $800,000 from 2008 to 2010 and spent 91 percent of the funds on scholarships and grants. Since recovering from his injury, Smith has participated in a number of inspirational speaking events including TED, American Bankers Association's Emerging Leaders Forum, and to the Alabama Crimson Tide Football Team. Smith has also partnered with brands including Oofos Recovery Footwear and clothing brands like Linksoul and Attitude is Free, the latter of which he created his Just Live collection. 100% of the proceeds from the collection are donated to the Center for the Intrepid where he spent most of his rehabilitation process."

He won a Memorial Cup with the junior Toronto Marlboros in 1964. In 1965, Gary Smith entered the NHL with the Toronto Maple Leafs, and was one of five goalies who played for the Maple Leafs during the 1966\u201367 regular season, their last Stanley Cup season. He eventually earned the nickname \"Suitcase\" Smith because of the large number of teams he played for. After playing with the dismal California Golden Seals from 1967\u201371, where he set records in 1970\u201371 for both the most games played in a single season and most losses in a single season, his first success was sharing the 1971\u201372 Vezina Trophy with Tony Esposito while with the Chicago Black Hawks. One year later, Smith and Esposito would help the Black Hawks to the Stanley Cup final where they would lose to the Montreal Canadiens in 6 games. In 1974\u201375, he also had a fine season with the Vancouver Canucks, with 72 games played and six shutouts.  Smith finished 5th place in balloting for the 1975 Hart Trophy, which goes to the player judged most valuable to his team in the NHL.  The 1975 Hart Trophy winner, Bobby Clarke, said in his acceptance speech that Smith was more deserving of the award. Smith later played in the World Hockey Association, and was a teammate of Wayne Gretzky while playing for the Indianapolis Racers. He would be part of the Winnipeg Jets' 1979 Avco World Trophy championship. Smith's last coach in Winnipeg was Tom McVie, who coached Smith the previous season while both were with the Washington Capitals. The Jets played the Edmonton Oilers, led by Wayne Gretzky. Ironically, when Wayne Gretzky went to his first game at Maple Leaf Gardens, Smith was one of the goalies in the game. The Maple Leafs played the California Golden Seals and Smith was the Seals goalie. Smith gave up the last goal in WHA history to Dave Semenko."

His explanation was the need to tighten his skate boots which stretched in size, forcing him to wear as many as 13 pairs of socks at times. He performed his undressing routine throughout his career as an active player, even after resolving his skate boot issues. Smith has had many other claims to fame, according to an interview in the Vancouver Province in 1997. In his first NHL game, Smith left his crease in an attempt to score a goal. He got to the Canadiens' blueline but then JC Tremblay came along. \"He nailed me,\" said Smith. As a result of his tendency to skate past the blue line the NHL introduced a rule preventing the goaltender from being involved in play after crossing the center red line. In another game Smith punted the puck in Maple Leaf Gardens, almost hitting the clock. Another time he left the Vancouver Pacific Coliseum still wearing his goaltender uniform. \"It's tough driving in your skates,\" he said in the same 1997 interview. As of 1997 he was living in Vancouver and managing the racehorses he owned, including one named Broadcaster, named after his brother Brian, an Ottawa broadcaster who was murdered. Gary currently resides in Del Mar, California and continues to manage his horses."

In five games, he returned 17 kickoffs for 358 yards and six punts for 37 yards. He spent the spring of 2001 playing in NFL Europe for the Scottish Claymores as a wide receiver. He led the league with 26 kickoff returns for 635 yards and was second in punt returns with 15 for 177 yards and second in combined net yards with 1,286. In 2002, Hall had his first NFL touchdown off a 60-yard reception at the New York Jets on October 6, 2002. Hall returned one kickoff and two punts for touchdowns. His two touchdowns off punt returns tied him for first in Chief franchise history. The 2002 NFL season earned Hall his first NFL Pro Bowl, being selected as a kick returner. Hall became the second player in NFL history to return a kickoff and a punt return for a touchdown in the same game. In 2003, Hall returned a kickoff or a punt for a touchdown four games in a row, which is an NFL record. The most memorable moment of the season came against the Denver Broncos in which he reversed direction twice to evade the entire special teams unit en route to a 93-yard punt return for a touchdown, his 7th in the 10-game stretch from the previous season, then went on to score 10 total touchdowns in 13 games. In the playoffs that year against the Indianapolis Colts, Hall had another kickoff return for a touchdown, giving him five for the year, as well as a receiving touchdown. Hall was named to the 2004 Pro Bowl as a kick/punt returner for his second time. In 2004, Hall touched the ball eight times for 242 yards vs. the San Diego Chargers on November 28, 2004. His six kickoff returns for 233 yards with a 96-yard touchdown in the game set a career-high. On December 19, 2004, he returned the opening kickoff 97-yards for a touchdown. This touchdown made him the Chiefs' franchise leader in career kickoff return touchdowns and career special teams touchdowns. During the 2004 NFL season, Hall set single-season Chiefs' franchise records with 68 kickoff returns and career-high 1,718 kickoff return yards. In 2005, in a memorable game against the Denver Broncos, Hall appeared to be on his way to a kickoff return for a touchdown, but he surprisingly fumbled the ball without being touched by a defensive player. With a touchdown on a kickoff return against the Philadelphia Eagles on October 2, 2005, he tied four players, among them Ollie Matson and Gale Sayers, for the most career kickoff return touchdowns, with six. That record stood until Joshua Cribbs broke it in 2009. Hall's sixth return was also his 10th return touchdown, placing him third in that category behind Brian Mitchell (13) and Eric Metcalf (12). In 2006, Hall had two kickoff returns for 86 yards and three punt returns for seven yards in Week 12 vs. the Denver Broncos on November 23, 2006. This game made him the sixth player to have 10,000 career kick return yards. Hall played his second postseason game at Indianapolis on January 6, 2007, in a rematch from the 2003 Divisional Playoffs."

Following this, he spent time at other Cameroonian clubs Jeunesse Star and Tonnerre Yaound\u00e9, before moving to France, to join Ligue 1 club Lille. Makoun started out playing in the centre\u2013back position but when he was at Lille, Makoun began playing in the centre\u2013back position. Having progressed through the ranks of Lille youth system, he signed his professional contract, keeping him until 2006. Makoun was called up to the first team by Manager Claude Puel during the 2002\u201303 season. He made his Lille debut, coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute, in a 1\u20130 loss against SC Bastia on 2 November 2002. Makoun made his first start for the side, starting the whole game, in a 2\u20130 loss against OGC Nice on 10 January 2003. At the end of the 2002\u201303 season, he went on to make thirteen appearances in all competitions. At the start of the 2003\u201304 season, Makoun scored his first goal for the club, as they beat the defending champion, Lyon, to win 1\u20130. He quickly became a first team regular for the side under the management of Puel, who was impressed with his quality performance. As the season progressed, Makoun began to develop for the side by displaying \"good technique and a lucidity which regularly allows him to play his role as a passer.\" It wasn't until on 31 October 2003 when Makoun scored his first goal of the season, in a 2\u20130 win against N\u00eemes Olympique in the second round of the Coupe de la Ligue. Two months later on 17 December 2003, he scored his second goal of the season, in a 3\u20132 loss against Saint-\u00c9tienne in the last 16 of the Coupe de la Ligue. At the end of the 2003\u201304 season, Makoun went on to make thirty\u2013four appearances and scoring three times in all competitions. At the start of the 2004\u201305 season, Makoun continued to regain his first team place, playing in the midfield position. Makoun started the season well when he helped Lille win the UEFA Intertoto Cup after beating U.D. Leiria 2\u20130 on aggregate. It wasn't until on 21 December 2004 when Makoun scored his first goal of the season against Strasbourg Alsace in the third round of the Coupe de la Ligue, as Lille lost 4\u20132 in penalty shootout following a 1\u20131 draw. However, during a 0\u20130 draw against Sochaux on 5 February 2005, he suffered a knee injury in the 6th minute, resulting in his substitution and was sidelined for a month. It wasn't until on 20 March 2005 when Makoun returned to the starting line\u2013up against Saint-\u00c9tienne, as he helped the side draw 0\u20130. At the end of the 2004\u201305 season, Makoun went on to make forty\u2013seven appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Reflecting to the 2004\u201305 season, he said: \"I had a great season. If I drew the attention of France-Foot journalists, it is because I have been very consistent. My club, Lille, was aligned on several fronts. We started our season with the Inter-toto cup. After this stage, we were eliminated at the quarter-final stage of the Uefa Cup by Auxerre. In the league, we finished in second place, a position that directly qualifies us for the next Champions League. Unfortunately, for the two trophies competing in France, our journey was not very brilliant\". At the start of the 2005\u201306 season, Makoun started the season well when he scored his first goal of the season, in a 3\u20133 draw against AC Ajaccio on 8 August 2005. Makoun continued to regain his first team place, playing in the midfield position. His second goal for the side came on 17 September 2005, in a 4\u20130 win against OGC Nice. A month later on 22 October 2005, he scored his third goal of the season, in a 2\u20130 win against FC Nantes. His performance against Manchester United in the UEFA Champions League earned him praises from the British media. After spending January with his international duty, Makoun returned to the first team, starting the whole game, in a 0\u20130 draw against Paris Saint-Germain on 12 February 2006. However, he was then sent\u2013off for a straight red card in the 50th minute, in a 1\u20130 win against AS Monaco on 26 February 2006. After serving a one match, Makoun returned to the starting line\u2013up on 9 March 2006, helping the side win 1\u20130 against Sevilla in the first leg of the UEFA Cup. Two weeks later on 25 March 2006, he made his 100th appearance for the side, in a 2\u20132 draw against Strasbourg. It wasn't until on 6 May 2006 when Makoun scored his fourth goal of the season, in a 4\u20130 win against Lyon. As a result, the win saw the club qualify for the UEFA Champions League next season. At the end of the 2005\u201306 season, he went on to make forty\u2013three appearances and scoring four times in all competitions. Ahead of the 2006\u201307 season, Makoun was linked a move away from Lille over the summer, but he made it clear of staying at the club. Makoun continued to regain his first team place, playing in the midfield position. He then helped the side qualify for the UEFA Champions League Group after beating FK Rabotni\u010dki 4\u20130 on aggregate in both legs. It was announced on 10 October 2006 that Makoun signed a contract extension with the club, keeping him until 2011. Four days later on 14 October 2006, he set up the club's equalising goal, in a 1\u20131 draw against Troyes. Three days later on 17 October 2006, Makoun scored his first goal of the game, in a 3\u20131 win against AEK Athens. Three months later on 24 January 2007, he scored his second goal of the game, in a 1\u20130 win against Paris Saint-Germain. Despite being sidelined on four occasions during the 2006\u201307 season, Makoun made forty\u2013five appearances and scoring two times in all competitions. Having missed the opening game of the season, Makoun made his first appearance of the 2007\u201308 season, starting the whole game, in a 2\u20131 win against Metz on 12 August 2007. Two weeks later on 26 August 2007, he scored his first goal of the season, in a 1\u20131 draw against Paris Saint-Germain.

The signing was also the first major deal between Portuguese agent Jorge Mendes and an English club.

He redshirted his true freshman season. In 2000, starter Dan Ellis missed some time due to an injury, but fellow redshirt freshman Bryson Spinner received the bulk of playing time in relief. After the 2000 season, coach George Welsh retired and was replaced by Al Groh. Schaub was the starter for the first game of the 2001 season at the Wisconsin Badgers. Over the 2001 season, Schaub and Spinner split quarterbacking duties nearly evenly. The two alternated in some games, while in others either Schaub or Spinner received nearly all the snaps. The two quarterback system worked relatively well with both effectively passing the ball to receiver Billy McMullen, the team's leading offensive threat. Schaub finished the season with 1,524 passing yards, 10 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. Spinner transferred to the University of Richmond for the 2002 season, seemingly making Schaub the unquestioned starter. However, Schaub was briefly replaced by redshirt freshman Marques Hagans in the first game of the 2002 season against the Colorado State Rams. Hagans was named the starter for the next game, against the Florida State Seminoles, but was replaced by Schaub who went on to his breakout season. He finished the season with 2,976 passing yards, 28 touchdowns, and seven interceptions. Schaub was the 2002 ACC Player of the Year, 2002 ACC Offensive Player of the Year and first-team All-State Virginia Sports Information Directors Association (VaSID) as a senior. Publicized in the 2003 preseason as a Heisman Trophy candidate, Schaub suffered a shoulder injury in the first game of the season and did not return for several games; therefore his overall numbers declined in his senior season. He finished the season with 2,952 passing yards, 18 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions. He was the Most Valuable Player of the 2003 Continental Tire Bowl and was twice selected to the All-ACC Academic Football Team. His University of Virginia awards included the John Acree Memorial Trophy, given to the football player with the highest qualities of leadership and unselfish service, and the Ben Wilson Award as the team's most outstanding offensive player. Schaub finished his college career with at least 22 school records. He played in a record 40 games at the quarterback position and finished his career as one of the most accurate passers in Atlantic Coast Conference history (.670 career completion percentage). His Virginia statistics included school career records for yards passing (7,502), touchdown passes (56), completions (716), attempts (1,069), completion percentage (.670), 300-yard games (8), and 200-yard games (20)."

Schaub helped teammate wide receiver Andre Johnson lead the league in both receptions and receiving yards through week 8 of the season, having 56 catches for 772 yards. The new quarterback-receiver tandem had their best day together through mid-season during the week 8 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals where Schaub threw for 280 yards, completing over 85% of his passes (24 of 28), 10 of those going to Johnson for 143 yards in the 35\u20136 rout. Schaub's season was broken up however with a knee injury against the Minnesota Vikings, which expected to keep him out for around 4 weeks, making Sage Rosenfels the new starter. Against the Green Bay Packers, Schaub completed 28 of 42 pass attempts for 414 yards and 2 touchdowns, also leading the Texans down the field to set up a Kris Brown game-winning field goal.

Schaub's 527 yards is tied with Hall of Famer and former Houston Oilers quarterback Warren Moon for the second-most passing yards in a single game in NFL history, only behind Norm Van Brocklin's 554 yards passing in 1951 against the already defunct Boston Yanks. In week 12, during the Thanksgiving game against the Detroit Lions, Schaub was kicked in the groin by Ndamukong Suh. Schaub rallied the Texans from a 10-point deficit to win once again in overtime, 34\u201331.

        "content": "Harold Hugh Cameron (February 6, 1890 \u2013 October 20, 1953) was a Canadian ice hockey defenceman who played professionally for the Toronto Blueshirts, Toronto Arenas, Ottawa Senators, Toronto St. Pats, and Montreal Canadiens. Cameron won three Stanley Cups in his career: his first as a member of the 1913\u201314 Toronto Blueshirts, his second as a member of the 1917\u201318 Blueshirts (Arenas), and his third as a member of the 1921\u201322 Toronto St. Pats (all predecessor clubs of the Toronto Maple Leafs). Cameron was considered one of the first great rushing and scoring defencemen. He scored 88 goals in 128 games in the NHL. He was also famous for his \"curved shot\" similar to that of today's curved hockey sticks. Cameron was the first player in NHL history to achieve what was later called a \"Gordie Howe hat trick\", doing so on December 26, 1917 during a 7-5 defeat of the Montreal Canadiens. In later years, he moved to Vancouver, British Columbia where he resided when he died in 1953. He was inducted posthumously into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963."

        "content": "Born in Pembroke, Ontario, Cameron played with the Pembroke Debaters club from 1908 until 1911, before becoming a professional with the Port Arthur Lake City of the Northern Ontario Hockey League (NOHL). The transaction is also famous as he demanded that his friend Frank Nighbor also be signed. While playing with Nighbor in the Upper Ottawa Valley Hockey League (UOVHL) during the 1910\u201311 season, the Pembroke Debaters won the Citizen Shield after having defeated Vankleek Hill 10 goals to 8. The 1911\u201312 Port Arthur team also featured future Hockey Hall of Fame member Jack Walker. Cameron, along with Nighbor, joined the Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association (NHA) for the 1912\u201313 season and stayed with the organization until the NHA suspended the franchise in the 1916\u201317 season, including the 1914 Stanley Cup win. He was picked up by the Montreal Wanderers for the balance of the season, playing six games for the Redbands. In 1917\u201318 he returned to the Blueshirts, now a franchise in the National Hockey League (NHL), operated by the Toronto Arena Company in their Stanley Cup-winning season. Cameron was the highest-paid player on the 1917\u201318 Toronto Arenas with a salary of $900, whereas his teammates' salaries ranged from $450 to $750. In 1918\u201319, Cameron was loaned to the Ottawa Senators and returned from the Senators in the 1919\u201320 season to the Toronto team, now named the Toronto St. Pats (St. Patricks). He was traded to the Montreal Canadiens in January 1920 (for Goldie Prodgers), but returned to Toronto the following fall when he was traded back to the club (again for Prodgers, and Joe Matte). The 1920\u201321 through 1922\u201323 seasons saw Cameron stay with the St. Pats, winning another Stanley Cup in 1922, the third for Toronto in the NHA and NHL. After the Stanley Cup win, Cameron was released, and he spent three seasons as a playing coach for the Saskatoon Crescents of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) where he switched to forward. After the Western League was folded and its players absorbed in the NHL, Cameron was not picked up, and he joined a succession of minor league teams in Saskatoon, Minneapolis, and St. Louis before retiring in 1931. He joined the Saskatoon team in 1932\u201333, playing nine games. He then left the playing side of the game for good, and became the Saskatoon coach from 1934 through 1937."

During his first two seasons in the NHA with the Toronto Blueshirts Cameron made a strong defensive pairing with Jack Marshall, and even though Cameron was only of average height (5\u00a0ft 10 in) and weight (155\u00a0lb) he could still use his body on the defensive side of the puck to stop oncoming opponents. Later on, with the Toronto Arenas, he would pair with big-bodied defenseman Harry Mummery (220\u00a0lb). In the NHL Cameron had among his defensive partners Sprague Cleghorn (Ottawa Senators and Toronto St. Patricks) and Red Stuart (Toronto St. Patricks)."

        "content": "Cameron had also a hard shot which landed him many goals throughout his hockey career, and he was one of the few players at the time who could curve his shot. Long time New York Rangers right winger Bill Cook, a teammate of Cameron with the Saskatoon Crescents of the WCHL and the WHL from 1923\u20131926, claimed Cameron could shoot curving pucks. Left winger Cy Denneny, a teammate of Cameron on the 1915\u201316 Toronto Blueshirts and the 1918\u201319 Ottawa Senators, was another player who could do the same trick, but both Cameron and Denneny employed specially scooped sticks for the deed. The players on the 1930\u201331 New York Rangers (including Cook, Leo Bourgeault, Frank Boucher, Murray Murdoch, John Ross Roach, and Eddie Rodden), in a newspaper interview with Harold C. Burr of The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, agreed that there was no one in the National Hockey League at that time who could fire off a curved vulcanized rubber disk in the same type of fashion. Cameron for the 1930\u201331 season had taken his hockey playing services to the St. Louis Flyers of the AHA. Although hockey sticks at the time were made almost exclusively with straight blades, Frank Boucher once claimed that Cameron played with a stick that was \"crooked like a sabre\", which allowed him to make his shots drop or veer to either side. Nevertheless, a small handful of contemporary players like Gordie Roberts were able to curve the path of pucks simply by wrist action, and modern historians speculate that Cameron had this ability as well."

Girardi remained the host of Kids on Deck in 2005, having shot his shows before spring training. During games, YES promoted Kids on Deck by showing Girardi sitting in the dugout during breaks in the game. Girardi was a broadcaster for the third, fourth, and fifth games of the 2006 World Series for Fox as part of the network's pregame and postgame team, along with host Jeanne Zelasko and regular analyst Kevin Kennedy. After fielding managerial offers for the 2007 season, Girardi instead came to terms with the YES network to return to the broadcast booth for 60-plus games as a Yankees analyst and co-host a new show on the network, Behind The Plate, with John Flaherty, also a former Yankee catcher. Girardi also served as color commentator for the No. 2 booth (usually with Thom Brennaman) on Major League Baseball on Fox. In 2018, he joined MLB Network as an analyst."

        "content": "After the 2005 regular season, Girardi was named the manager of the Marlins, replacing manager Jack McKeon. His first notable action as manager was to prohibit facial hair, a policy similar to that of Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. The team had a 78\u201384 record with Girardi as manager, and was in wild-card contention even though the team had the lowest payroll in Major League Baseball. At $15\u00a0million, the Marlins' 2006 payroll was lower than the salaries of several MLB players. However, Girardi was nearly fired on August 6 when he got into an argument with Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria during a game. According to witnesses and video footage, the Marlins owner was heckling home plate umpire Larry Vanover. When the umpire warned Girardi about the harassment, Girardi and his bench coach Gary Tuck then turned to Loria and told him to stop. Team executives had to talk Loria out of his stated desire to fire Girardi immediately after that game. On October 3, 2006, the Marlins announced that they had fired Girardi as manager, and replaced him with Atlanta Braves third base coach Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez. Girardi said only that he appreciated the opportunity to manage the club. Girardi was thought to be among the leading candidates to replace New York Yankees manager Joe Torre after they lost in the 2006 American League Division Series, but Torre remained with the team. Girardi was also a candidate for the Cubs' manager position, to succeed Dusty Baker; he interviewed for the job just days after leaving the Marlins. With his playing experience in Chicago, he was considered a front-runner for the position. However, the Cubs chose to go with veteran manager Lou Piniella. Girardi took himself out of the running for the Washington Nationals' managerial job shortly thereafter and returned to the broadcast booth for the YES Network in 2007. He said taking another managerial job would have meant a third move in as many years for his family. Despite Girardi's firing, he was rewarded for his achievements with the Marlins in 2006 with the National League Manager of the Year Award and the Sporting News Manager of the Year Award for the National League."

        "content": "In June 2007 after the Baltimore Orioles fired manager Sam Perlozzo, Girardi interviewed for and was offered the position with the Orioles but turned it down. When the Yankees' managerial position became vacant after the 2007 season, the Yankees interviewed Girardi, Tony Pe\u00f1a, and Don Mattingly. On October 29, 2007, Girardi was reported to be the Yankees' choice and the next day he signed a three-year contract, reportedly worth about $7.5\u00a0million. Girardi chose to wear number 27 to signify his wish to lead the Yankees to their 27th world championship. Girardi is a health enthusiast and banned sweets such as ice cream and soda in the clubhouse. On August 2, 2008, Girardi participated in his first Old Timers' Day, the last such game played at the original Yankee Stadium. Girardi participated in the next Old Timer's Day on July 19, 2009, the first in the new Yankee Stadium, as well as every one since then. Girardi's first year as a Yankees manager was unsuccessful as the team was eliminated from postseason contention for the first time since 1993, finishing 2008 with an 89\u201373 record, third in the AL East. In 2009, his second year as manager, the Yankees were a much improved team. He led the Yankees to their 40th AL pennant and their 27th World Series title (defeating the Philadelphia Phillies), his first World Series title as manager and the Yankees' first since 2000. Before the 2010 season, Girardi changed his number to 28. Newly acquired center-fielder Curtis Granderson had worn 28, but agreed to change his number to 14. Following the 2010 season, Girardi and the Yankees agreed to a three-year deal to keep him as the Yankees' manager. The Yankees' 2011 season was plagued by injuries that caused disabled list stints for several key players. Despite the setbacks, Girardi managed to lead the team to the AL East title. Rob Parker of ESPN commended Girardi's performance and felt his efforts were deserving of American League Manager of the Year, but felt he would not get the award due to the Yankees high payroll and what Parker alleges is an anti-Yankee bias. The Yankees were defeated by the Detroit Tigers 3\u20132 in the divisional round. On June 15, 2012, Girardi won his 500th game as a manager. The Yankees reached the playoffs and defeated the Baltimore Orioles 3\u20132 in the ALDS, but were swept by the Detroit Tigers in the ALCS on October 18, 2012. Girardi's 2013 season was marred by numerous player injuries and controversies, resulting in the Yankees finishing 85-77 (tied 3rd in AL East) and missing the postseason for the first time since 2008. On October 10, 2013, Girardi signed a four-year deal worth $16 million to remain as manager of the New York Yankees. In 2014 the Yankees finished 84\u201378, (second place in AL East) and did not qualify for the postseason for the second straight year. In 2015, the Yankees finished 87\u201375, (second place again in AL East), clinching the top wild card spot which marked the team's first playoff appearance since 2012, but they lost to the Houston Astros in the 2015 American League Wild Card Game. On May 21, 2016, Girardi managed his 1,500th game. After missing the playoffs again in 2016, the Yankees finished 91\u201371 in 2017, second place in the AL East, and qualified for the postseason as the first Wild Card team in the AL. In 2017 he was successful on a higher percentage of replay challenges than any other MLB manager with 10 or more challenges, at 75.0%. The Yankees beat the Twins, 8\u20134, in the wild card game and advanced to the ALDS, where they played the Cleveland Indians. After falling behind 0\u20132, amidst a controversial decision to not challenge a potential hit-by-pitch, Girardi's Yankees rallied back to win three games in a row and faced the Houston Astros in the ALCS. The series began in Houston, and after again falling behind 0\u20132, the team won all three games at Yankee Stadium, but the season ended after losing Games 6 and 7 back in Houston. Afterward, Girardi's contract expired and on October 26, the Yankees announced he would not return as manager, being replaced by Aaron Boone."

The Phillies again barely missed the playoffs, eliminated with three days left in the 2021 season.

Carney remained with the Saints in this capacity through the playoffs, and received credit for his role in preparing the comparatively inexperienced Hartley to make a number of critical kicks that helped the Saints win their first Super Bowl. Carney started the 2010 season without a team. However, after Hartley missed 3 out of 7 field goal attempts during the Saints' first 3 games, including a short kick in overtime that would have won a game against the Atlanta Falcons, the Saints re-signed Carney (while also retaining Hartley) on September 28, 2010.

A four-time Vezina Trophy winner, Thompson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1959. He was a member of one Stanley Cup-winning team, as a rookie in the 1928\u201329 season with the Boston Bruins. At the start of the 1938\u201339 season, after ten full seasons with Boston, he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings, where he completed the season, and played another full one before retiring. During his NHL career, he recorded 81\u00a0shutouts, the sixth-highest of any goaltender. After retiring from playing, he coached lower-league teams before becoming a noted professional scout. Thompson helped popularize the technique of the \"glove save\" which was catching the puck with his hands as a method of making a save. A competent puckhandler, he was the first goaltender in the NHL to record an assist in 1936 by passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player."

He grew up in Calgary, Alberta, where his brother, Paul\u2014who also became a professional ice hockey player\u2014was born in 1906. As a child, he enjoyed playing baseball and ice hockey. Initially, Thompson was not a goaltender, though he agreed to play the position to get into games. As a teenager playing competitive ice hockey, he acquired the nickname \"Tiny\" as a joke, as he was the tallest player on the team, standing ; the nickname stuck with him for the rest of his career. Thompson began his junior career playing for the Calgary Monarchs in 1919 at the age of 16. He competed for the Memorial Cup, awarded to the Canadian junior hockey champions that year, playing in two games and surrendering 11 goals, a respectable amount in that era. After spending the 1920\u201321 season playing for Calgary Alberta Grain, Thompson played three seasons in Bellevue, Alberta. In the 1924\u201325 season, he joined the Duluth Hornets, playing 40 games, recording a shutout in 11 of them. The following season, Thompson joined the Minneapolis Millers of the American Hockey Association (AHA). In his three seasons with the Millers, he appeared in 118\u00a0games, recording 33\u00a0shutouts with a 1.37\u00a0goals against average (average of goals surrendered in a span of sixty minutes)."

        "content": "Thompson began his National Hockey League (NHL) career with the Boston Bruins in the 1928\u201329 season after his contract was purchased by Boston manager Art Ross. Despite having never seen Thompson play, Ross had heard about Thompson's good reputation in Minnesota. In his first game, he posted a shutout, becoming the only Hockey Hall of Fame goaltender to accomplish this feat. In his first season, he appeared in all 44 of the Bruins' games, posting 12\u00a0shutouts and a 1.15\u00a0goals-against average, the second-lowest goals-against average in NHL history to date, second to George Hainsworth's 0.98 GAA. Hainsworth set his record that same season. Placing first in the American Division, the Bruins had a perfect record in the playoffs en route to their first Stanley Cup victory, defeating the Montreal Canadiens and the New York Rangers. Thompson recorded three shutouts in the five playoff games, and allowed only three goals. The following season, Thompson again appeared in all of the Bruins' 44\u00a0games, posting three shutouts and a 2.19\u00a0goals-against average. The league changed its rules on forward passing, which resulted in a sharp increase in goalscoring. Boston won all but six games, finishing with a 38\u20135\u20131 record, the best winning percentage for any team in a season. Surrendering only 98 goals, Thompson bested Chicago goaltender Charlie Gardiner to win the first of his four Vezina Trophies. The Vezina Trophy is awarded to the league's top goaltender, which was determined prior to the 1981\u201382 season by number of goals surrendered by goaltenders who had played a minimum number of games. In the playoffs, however, they suffered their first two-game losing streak, as they were swept 2\u20130 by the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup finals. Earlier in the playoffs, Thompson's winning streak of seven playoff games was snapped; it remains, as of 2014, the longest playoff winning streak to start a career. In the 1930\u201331 season, he played all 44\u00a0games again, and was named to the Second All-Star team. In the playoffs, Boston lost the semifinals to the Montreal Canadiens; during game two of the series Thompson became the first goaltender to be pulled for a sixth attacker at the end of a game to give his team a higher chance to score a goal. Even though Boston still lost, coach Art Ross' maneuver was described as \"amazing\" the following day, and this technique, known as \"open net\", caught on with the rest of the league. The Bruins missed the playoffs for the first time in Thompson's career in the 1931\u201332 season. He won only 13 games while appearing in 43 out of Boston's 48 games, which was the only time he missed games as a member of the Bruins. The next season, Boston made the playoffs once more, losing to the Toronto Maple Leafs. The final game of the playoff series was described as Thompson's most memorable. During that game, Toronto and Boston were tied after regulation time and over 100 minutes of overtime proceeded, with Thompson dueling Toronto's goaltender Lorne Chabot. After the end of the fifth overtime period, managers Conn Smythe of the Maple Leafs and Art Ross of the Bruins asked league president Frank Calder to suspend the game, but Calder refused. Early in the sixth overtime period, a pass from Boston defenseman Eddie Shore was intercepted, and Ken Doraty skated in on a breakaway, cleanly beating Thompson at 4:46 of the period. The losing goaltender in the second-longest NHL game, Thompson received a standing ovation from fans at the Maple Leaf Gardens. Thompson finished the playoff series with 1.23 goals-against average, despite a losing record. Thompson became the second goaltender to win his second Vezina Trophy in 1932\u201333 since its inception in the 1926\u201327 season, as he recorded 11\u00a0shutouts and a 1.76\u00a0goals-against average. After missing the playoffs in the 1933\u201334 season, they rebounded to first place in the American Division the following season, as Thompson was named to the Second All-Star team for the second time. In the playoffs, the Bruins won only one of their four games; their only win was on the strength of Thompson's shutout, who finished the playoffs with a 1.53 goals-against average. In the 1935\u201336 NHL season, Thompson recorded 10 shutouts, but Boston managed to win only 22 out of their 48 games. During the season, he recorded an assist, a rarity for goaltenders. At the end of the season, he was named to the First All-Star team for the first time, and won the Vezina Trophy for the third time, tying George Hainsworth's all-time mark with three victories. The ensuing two-game, total-goal playoff series against the Toronto Maple Leafs was a series of contrasts, as the Bruins lost 8\u20136. In the opening game, the Bruins shut out Toronto 3\u20130, while they lost the other game 8\u20133.  In 1937\u201338, his final full season with the Bruins, he won 30 out of the 48 games, but Boston lost to the Maple Leafs once again in the playoffs. Thompson set a new record by winning his fourth and final Vezina Trophy. He was also named to the First All-Star team for the second time. When Thompson left the Bruins, he had compiled 252 wins. This record stood for 81 years, until it was surpassed by Tuukka Rask.  Thompson is also the Boston Bruins' all-time leader in regular-season shutouts with 74, far ahead of the 52 achieved by runner-up Tuukka Rask."

Brimsek would go on to lead the Bruins to a Stanley Cup victory that season, earning the nickname \"Mister Zero\" while picking up 10 regular season shutouts, the Vezina Trophy, First All-Star Team honours, and the Calder Memorial Trophy, which is given \"to the player selected as the most proficient in his first year of competition\". To make space for Brimsek, Thompson was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for Normie Smith and $15,000 on November 16, 1938; Thompson also received a $1,000 bonus from Boston. Boston manager Art Ross predicted that Thompson, now 35, would play for the Red Wings for at least another five seasons; however, Thompson remained with the team for only two seasons before retiring from playing. The Red Wings posted a losing record in both of these seasons, although they made the playoffs both times. Overall, Thompson appeared in 85 regular-season games for Detroit, recording a 32\u201341\u201312 record, seven shutouts, and a 2.54\u00a0goals-against average, and in 11 playoff games, posting a 5\u20136, with one shutout and a 2.41 goal-against average."

He coached 56 games in two seasons. The Bisons missed the playoffs both times. He appeared in one game as goaltender in the 1940\u201341 season. During World War II, Thompson served in the Royal Canadian Air Force and doubled as the coach of the Calgary RCAF Mustangs of the Alberta Senior Hockey League. He led the Mustangs to the league championship series in 1942\u201343 against the Calgary Currie Army team where injuries to the Mustangs' goaltenders brought him back onto the ice in March 1943. With Thompson in goal, the Mustangs defeated Currie Army 8\u20134 to tie the best-of-five series at two wins apiece. He played the deciding game, but his team fell short of winning the Alberta title with a 3\u20131 loss to Currie Army. After the war, Thompson became chief Western Canada scout for the Chicago Black Hawks. He was one of the few scouts at the time who sought to discover a player's personality along with their playing ability. Thompson often conversed with players as part of an effort to learn about the players he was watching."

        "content": "Thompson was a stand-up goaltender, rarely falling on both knees to stop a puck. He was one of the first NHL goaltenders to catch the puck with his hand to make a save, and helped popularize the technique. Using gloves that were smaller than those of other players, he was among the best puck-catchers of his era. He stood in the way of the puck with minimal padding, risking being struck when moving to catch it instead of simply deflecting it away from the net. His signature technique, very often featured in photographs of him, involved dropping to one knee with the paddle of his goalstick covering the five-hole, and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net. Although he caught the puck with his glove, the gloves he had did not have anything like the level of safety and comfort provided by the modern blocker and trapper glove combination. Thompson was described by Johnny Bower, a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, as a good puckhandler, and one of the best of his time at forward passing. In the 1935\u201336 season, Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player."

His 38 wins during that season was a Boston record that was eclipsed only in the 1982\u201383 season, by Pete Peeters (who won 40 of 62 games played); since then, no Bruins goaltender has had more than 37 wins in a season. His 14 consecutive wins that regular season also set an NHL record, which has since been tied by 3 other goaltenders. Thompson is the all-time Bruins leader for shutouts and goals-against average. Thompson held the records for most games played (468) and wins (252) by a Bruins goaltender until 2019, when both records were surpassed by Tuukka Rask.  Throughout his entire NHL career, Thompson accrued 81\u00a0shutouts, which is sixth all-time in NHL history, and was second to only George Hainsworth (who had 94) when Thompson retired. He also posted seven shutouts in the playoffs. He is fifth all-time in goals-against average, allowing on average only 2.08 per a 60-minute span. He led all goaltenders in regular-season games played 10 times, and in regular-season wins five times. In 1959, Thompson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He died in Calgary on February 9, 1981. He was survived by his wife, Edith, and his daughter, Sandra."

The theme song to Hawaii Five-O was often played before his starts at Shea Stadium during his days with the Mets. Fernandez had an unorthodox pitching motion with a hesitation at the end, followed by a sudden slingshot sidearm delivery. This deceptive motion, coupled with an effective curveball and a rising fastball, made him a major strikeout threat throughout his career. Fernandez's strikeouts were often commemorated by Mets' fans in the upper deck putting up taped signs marked with the letter \"S\" for Sid.

In August 2007 it was reported that the former had made an offer of \u00a36\u00a0million for the player and, five days later, it was confirmed by both clubs that he was the subject of an acceptable bid from the English side, believed to be \u00a36\u00a0million for Benfica's 50% share in the player, with Everton having to negotiate with Global Sports Agency for the other half his playing rights; later reports indicated Everton were willing to pay \u00a312\u00a0million for 100% of the rights. On 14 August, it was reported that Fernandes had flown to the Merseyside to complete the deal after being left out of the squad in Benfica's game, and he attended Everton's match against Blackburn 11 days later. Adding to the fact the player's rights were partly owned by an agency, the Premier League did not agree to the transfer as Everton would only half-own the player's contract \u2013 the English were not too happy about this as the league had previously let Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano move to other clubs under the same agreements.

        "content": "Anderson was born in Queens, New York City. As a 16-year-old high school sophomore, the LeFrak City, Queens native who attended academic and athletic powerhouse Archbishop Molloy High School in Briarwood, Queens, was considered one of the best basketball prospects in America. Collegiate recruiters began scouting Anderson in sixth grade and he was on the front page of the New York City sports section when he was 14. By the end of his high school career, he was a four-time Parade All-American, a feat not accomplished since Lew Alcindor, and the first player to be named All-City four times. He was a McDonald's All-American, was named New York State Mr. Basketball by the New York State Coaches Organization, and named High School Basketball Player of the Year by Gatorade, the New York State Sportswriters Association, Parade, Naismith, and USA Today Despite his coach, Jack Curran, benching him for the first quarter of all of his games during his freshman year at Molloy, Anderson set the all-time state record for scoring in New York, with 2,621 points. This record stood until 2004, when Lincoln High School guard Sebastian Telfair eclipsed the mark late in his senior season. He was considered the No. 1 player in the country, over such notables as Jimmy Jackson and Shaquille O'Neal."

Anderson played two years for Georgia Tech as the team's starting point guard, helping lead the team to the Final Four in 1990, along with swingmen Dennis Scott and Brian Oliver. The trio was nicknamed \"Lethal Weapon 3\". Despite winning the ACC title, they entered the NCAA tourney as only the fourth seed. They proceeded to sweep through the LSU Tigers, led by Shaquille O'Neal, and two Big 10 teams on their way to the Final Four. Georgia Tech's tournament run ended against eventual champions UNLV in the Final Four. With Scott and Oliver gone after that season, Anderson averaged nearly 26 points per game. Georgia Tech secured a No. 8 seed for the 1991 NCAA Tournament, where they lost in the second round to Ohio State. Soon after, Anderson announced that he would forgo his last two years of eligibility to enter the NBA draft."

        "content": "Anderson was selected by the New Jersey Nets with the second pick in the 1991 NBA draft. He was the youngest player in the league in his rookie year, and averaged seven points, two rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game. In Anderson's second season he nearly doubled his point, rebound, and assist averages. In his third season, he averaged 18.8 points and 9.6 assists. Anderson and teammate Derrick Coleman represented the East squad in the 1994 NBA All-Star Game. He was traded to the Charlotte Hornets in 1996, along with Gerald Glass, in a deal for Khalid Reeves and Kendall Gill. In 1996 Anderson signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. In 1998, the Trail Blazers traded Anderson, along with Alvin Williams, Gary Trent, and two 1998 first-round picks to the Toronto Raptors for Damon Stoudamire, Carlos Rogers, Walt Williams, and a 1998 second-round pick, but he refused to report to the team because he did not want to play in Canada, which prompted the Raptors to trade him to the Boston Celtics, along with \u017dan Tabak and Popeye Jones for John Thomas, Chauncey Billups, and Dee Brown. Anderson spent a considerable amount of time as a Celtic before he was sent to the Seattle SuperSonics, along with Vitaly Potapenko and Joseph Forte, and in a package for Vin Baker and Shammond Williams. At the 2003 NBA trade deadline, Anderson was dealt back to the Hornets, who had since relocated to New Orleans, for Elden Campbell. He then played as a reserve point guard for the Indiana Pacers, Atlanta Hawks, and Los Angeles Clippers. Anderson was released from Lithuania's \u017dalgiris Kaunas after the 2005\u201306 season, thus ending his professional career as a basketball player."

He was called up to Boise where he played in 2 games. He played for the Lansing Lugnuts, the Cubs' Single-A affiliate, in . There, he hit .285 with 4 home runs and 47 runs batted in. In , he played for the Daytona Cubs. He hit .299 with 8 home runs and 47 runs batted in. In , he played for the Double-A West Tennessee Diamond Jaxx. He hit .304 with 11 home runs and 25 runs batted in. His season was shortened due to a broken ankle suffered during the season. In , his season began poorly, as he hit .222 in June and slugged only .343, but soon after he broke out of his slump to end with a batting average of .282, on-base percentage of .341, and slugging percentage of .451. Pie played 55 games of the 2007 season with the Iowa Cubs. Pie was a highly touted young prospect, and put on the fast-track to reach the big-league club, although he did not start the  season in the major leagues. Pie's strikeout rates continued to be much higher than average. Pie was called up from Triple-A Iowa on April 17, , and was in the starting lineup, replacing the injured Alfonso Soriano. At the time of his call-up, Pie was batting .444 with one home run and six RBI in 36 at-bats. Before the 2007 season, Pie was ranked as the number one prospect in the Cubs organization. He was nicknamed \"The Cat.\" Pie got his first major league hit on April 17, 2007, a double off Greg Maddux of the San Diego Padres. He scored his first run in the same inning on a Derrek Lee hit. In the same game, Pie also threw a runner out at home plate from center field which gave the Cubs a chance to win the game. On April 23, Pie changed his number from 17 to 20. Pie recorded his first major league home run on April 27, 2007, off Anthony Reyes of the St. Louis Cardinals. Pie was sent back down to the minors, but he was recalled on June 3, 2007 and remained with the club until July 13, when he was sent back down to Triple-A to get more regular at-bats. However, the Cubs recalled Pie from the minors in order to replace an injured Alfonso Soriano and \u00c1ngel Pag\u00e1n on August 8, 2007. On August 9, Pie was brought back up to Chicago. When the Cubs traded their starting left-handed center fielder Jacque Jones in November 2007, general manager Jim Hendry indicated that the club wasn't necessarily looking outside for a veteran, with Pie and Sam Fuld in the mix. Fuld pushed Pie for the center field spot during spring training (Piniella in late February said that Pie was only \"a head or nose in front\" of Fuld). \"He's ready to go out there in spring training lined up next to Pie and compete to play center field\", Hendry said of Fuld. Pie fell victim to the spring training  injury bug that afflicted the Cubs. Originally deemed \"a minor surgery on the groin region\", Cubs.com reported the injury as \"a twisted testicle\", an injury more commonly known as testicular torsion. The surgery involved sewing the outer layer of the testicle to the scrotum wall. The surgery was deemed successful, and Pie reported back to spring training. Pie won the center field job competition in spring training, and started opening day in center field. However, due to a slow start and the signing of former Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Reed Johnson, Pie by May 2008 was utilized mostly in a platoon with Johnson and as a defensive replacement. The Cubs signed Jim Edmonds on May 14, 2008, and optioned Pie."

In the 2009 season, Pie started in left field for the Orioles for most of April and part of May. However, his struggles at the plate and occasional mental lapses led to the Orioles calling up rookie Nolan Reimold, who had been playing well with the Triple-A Norfolk Tides and quickly seized the opportunity to become the Orioles' starting left fielder. While on the bench for most of June and July, Pie worked extensively on improving his swing and pitch recognition with Orioles' hitting coach Terry Crowley. Injuries to Orioles' center fielder Adam Jones and Nolan Reimold's nagging Achilles problem allowed Pie to play more regularly later in the season, and he showed significant improvement compared to his April performance. On August 14, 2009, Pie took full advantage of a spot in the starting lineup by hitting for the cycle, becoming only the fourth Oriole to ever do so. Pie won the starting left field assignment in 2010 after a very strong spring, but landed on the 60-day disabled list not long into the season, where he remained until July 6, 2010. Pie was designated for assignment by Baltimore on August 23, 2011. After the 2011 season, he elected for free agency."

During his recent career with the Texans, Brown has raised $384,000 for Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Charity Care Program through the program Kris Brown\u2019s Kick Club. The program's mission is to provide hope, medical resources, and healing for patients at Texas Children's Hospital that do not have the ability to provide these for themselves and to increase community awareness about their needs. His involvement stemmed from a personal experience that Brown dealt with as a child. His sister April was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer at the age of 11. She recovered and has been in remission for 13 years. The support his family received during the ordeal served as the inspiration to form Kris Brown's Kick Club. On March 7, 2004, Brown greeted President George W. Bush when he landed at Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. Bush honored Brown and Texas Children's Hospital for their charity efforts. In addition, Brown started the \u201cKicks for Kids\u201d program in 2002, partnering with Ikon and Academy Sports & Outdoors to donate $800 to the Houston Texans Foundation for every point that Brown scored on the field. On August 2012, a report from The Kansas City Star mentioned that Brown's company, Savoreaux, Inc. was holding a job fair for his Dunkin Donuts locations that had recently opened.

His performances that season caught the eye of Premier League side Everton who paid \u00a31.5 million for him during the summer of 1997. Two years later he was sold to Sunderland where he remained until 2005. Whilst with The Black Cats he spent time on loan with Barnsley before returning to Grimsby for two separate loan spells during the 2002\u201303 season, in his time back at Blundell Park he was unable to save the club from relegation. He later moved on loan to Leeds United before joining Burnley permanently. His stay with Burnley was brief and moved to Reading where he helped them earn promotion to the Premier League for the first time, in 2008 he moved to Crystal Palace where he remained for a year before transferring to Doncaster Rovers. He departed Rovers in the summer of 2012 and joined League Two side Barnet, prior to his move to the North London club he had played his entire professional football career inside the top two divisions of English football. He joined Gateshead in September 2013. During his career, Oster represented Wales at international level, where he earned 13 caps between 1997 and 2004.

Oster was released by Sunderland in January 2005, shortly after returning to the Black Cats in disgrace from a loan at Leeds United, where he scored once against Millwall.

He was drafted by the New York Islanders in the second round of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft after playing in junior for the London Diamonds and the Oshawa Generals. Behind Billy Smith and Kelly Hrudey on the Islanders' goaltending depth chart, Hackett split his first two seasons with New York and the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League (AHL). He led Springfield to a Calder Cup win in 1990 and was awarded the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy, annually given to the most valuable player of the playoffs. The San Jose Sharks claimed him in the 1991 NHL Expansion Draft. During his first season in San Jose, Hackett was named team MVP for his play. However, after winning only two games in 1992-93, one of them a Sharks' record 57-save effort against the Kings, Hackett was dealt to the Chicago Blackhawks prior to 1993\u201394 and he backed up Ed Belfour for several seasons. His excellent play in 1996\u201397 allowed the Blackhawks to trade Belfour to San Jose mid-season. His only full season as Chicago's top goaltender was highlighted by a career-high eight shutouts. A month into the season, Hackett was involved in a six-player trade which sent him to the Montreal Canadiens. He quickly became a fan favorite in Montreal as he recorded career highs in games played (63) and wins (26). After another solid season in 1999\u20132000, Hackett was limited to fifteen games in 2000\u201301 and eighteen games in 2001\u201302 due to a shoulder injury and lost the starter's job to 2002 Vezina Trophy winner Jos\u00e9 Th\u00e9odore in the process. This signaled the end of his stint with Montreal as midway through 2002\u201303 he was involved in a three-way trade which sent him back to San Jose temporarily and then on to the Boston Bruins. The Bruins, who had been looking for a number one goaltender, threw Hackett into that role. After shutting out Philadelphia in his Boston debut, Hackett played well until a broken finger caused him to miss time including the start of the Bruins' playoff series with New Jersey, forcing Boston to go with Steve Shields. During the off-season, Hackett signed a two-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers on the first day of free agency. He started his Flyers career by posting shutouts in his first two games, and accumulated a record of nine wins, two losses and six ties in his first seventeen games. However, in December, he lost six starts in a row and following a win in early January, lost his next two starts. He was diagnosed with positional vertigo and after a one-game rehab stint with the AHL's Philadelphia Phantoms on February 6, Hackett retired on February 9, 2004. Hackett finished his career after appearing in 500 NHL regular season games."

Having slipped to 7\u20139 in the ACC\u2014the team's first sub-.500 conference record in more than a decade\u2014Maryland was not as highly regarded as in years past and wound up as the tournament's 6th seed. However, the Terps ultimately upset the tournament's top three seeds, knocking off Wake Forest (3), NC State (2), and Duke (1), to win their first ACC Tournament title in 20 years. During this run, Gilchrist dazzled as the Terps' primary offensive option. First, Gilchrist hit the game-winning free throw against a Chris Paul-led Wake Forest team, scoring 16 points and shooting 4-for-4 from 3-point range. Next, Gilchrist led a 21-point comeback against the NC State Wolfpack, scoring 23 of his 30 points after halftime (and shooting 9-for-9 from the field); the 30-point performance was the first for a Terp since Juan Dixon scored 33 points against the Kansas Jayhawks in the 2002 NCAA Final Four. But Gilchrist was saving his best for last. In the tournament final against Duke\u2014a team bound for the 2004 Final Four and loaded with six future NBA players\u2014Gilchrist led the Terps back from a 12-point deficit with less than five minutes left in the game. Most dramatically, Gilchrist closed the 2nd half with a driving layup that drew a fifth and final foul on Shelden Williams, Duke's best low-post presence and Gilchrist's main competition for tournament MVP. Gilchrist's ensuing foul shot would tie the game at 77 with 20 seconds left, and Maryland went on to dominate the overtime and secure a 95\u201387 victory. For his three-day heroics, Gilchrist was unanimously named tournament MVP. The win also snapped Duke's drive for a sixth consecutive ACC Tournament title, while propelling Maryland into the 2004 NCAA Tournament; though the Terps ultimately lost by a few points to Syracuse in the second round, the team was seen as an up-and-coming squad that had overachieved, despite its youth. However, Gilchrist's career at Maryland\u2014and fans' and NBA scouts' glowing opinion of him\u2014would never reach these heights again. Led by their junior point guard, the Terps entered the 2004\u20132005 season ranked in the top 15 in the nation, but would succumb to road struggles and a late season collapse to again finish 7\u20139 in the conference. Nor could the team summon 2004's magic in the 2005 ACC Tournament; the Terps lost in the first round to Clemson, the third time the Tigers defeated the Terps that year. With a middling 16\u201312 record, Maryland missed the NCAA tournament for the first time in 13 years and accepted a consolation trip to the NIT, where they lost in the semifinals to South Carolina."

In 1930/31 he along with Syd Howe and Wally Kilrea were loaned from Ottawa to the Philadelphia Quakers to help liven up the team and attract more Quaker fans. Philly was in bad financial shape at the time and needed greater attendance to survive.  With the assistance of Shields and company their games became \"quite exciting\", culminating with a Christmas Day game when the entire Philadelphia police force were called to quell a near riot. With the onset of the Depression, the team folded the following year. The Quakers set another near NHL record for games lost, however they were one of the more \"lively\" teams of the time. On a couple of occasions during his career, he had to fill in as a goalie. In those days no spare goalie was available and if the one and only was injured during a game one of the players had to fill-in. He played in the American Hockey League (the primary farm teams of the NHL) for the Washington Lions, Buffalo Bisons and the New Haven Eagles from 1938 to 1942. He served as playing coach for Washington and then enlisted in the RCAF. Shields was selected to All-Star teams twice during his AHL career During his service in the airforce he was playing coach for the RCAF Sabres stationed in Arnprior, Ontario. After the war, \"Big Pete\" went on to Referee in the AHL from 1946 to 1948 and then hung up his skates permanently. He played a total of 457 game in professional hockey in the days when bus and train were the only means of transport. Allan Shields was reported in the media at the time, as \"a clean, rugged player\" and \"one of the most valuable defensemen in the entire league\". King Clancy who was best man at Shields' wedding, had nothing but praise for Allan's ability as a defenseman."

The many Jets fans who attended the draft, held in New York City, were surprised and outraged by the choice; O'Brien was so obscure that New York television reporter Sal Marchiano twice mangled his name while reporting on fan reaction to the draft. (O'Brien said after his retirement, \"Who blames [the fans], right? Who, in New York, has heard of Cal, University of California, Davis? Nobody ... I'm not sure I would have reacted any differently. Heck, some of my cousins grew up as Jets fans. They were probably doing the same thing.\") O'Brien played quarterback for over a decade in the National Football League. He amassed over 25,000 yards in his 11-year career.  In 1985, he was the highest rated quarterback in the NFL, finishing the season with a rating of 96.2. He also led the NFL with the lowest rate of interceptions in 1985, 1987, and 1988.  He retired after spending the 1993 season with the Philadelphia Eagles where he only started 4 games and mostly served as a backup for Randall Cunningham and Bubby Brister. O'Brien was the first quarterback to pass for 400 or more yards (431) in a game and earn a perfect NFL 158.3 rating, a feat he accomplished against the Seattle Seahawks in 1986 and would not be matched until 27 years later, by Nick Foles in 2013, Jared Goff in 2018 & Deshaun Watson in 2019. O'Brien is also one of only 4 quarterbacks in NFL history to have a perfect passer rating of 158.3 in a game while attempting 30 or more passes. O'Brien was also the holder of another NFL record that lasted for 25 years when he combined for 927 (884 net) yards and 10 touchdowns passing with Dan Marino. The new record (achieved January 1, 2012) is 1,000 yards passing with 11 touchdowns (1 more TD and 73 more yards) in a game that featured the Detroit Lions vs the Green Bay Packers. O'Brien went to the Pro Bowl twice, in 1985 and 1991."

In the 2006\u201307 season, Paul Jewell showed renewed faith in Skoko giving him an extended run in the side. The transfers of Jimmy Bullard and Graham Kavanagh to Fulham and Sunderland, respectively, in the summer of 2006 left a gap in Wigan's midfield and this led to him becoming a mainstay in the Wigan Athletic midfield, partnering Paul Scharner and Denny Landzaat. He signed a new contract deal keeping him at Wigan until 2008. However, at the end of the season it became clear that Skoko had played his last game for the club. The two main reasons were because he did not play enough games for Wigan to trigger a clause in his contract and also the impossibility of receiving a visa for his stay in England due to his international retirement with Australia. It was decided in May 2008 that Skoko's contract would not be renewed and he was subsequently released by Wigan."

Law made his major league debut for the Pirates in 1950. He played one season and then served in the military from 1951 to 1954. Upon returning to the major leagues, he eventually earned a spot in the Pirates' starting rotation. He shared the NL Player of the Month award in August 1959 (4-0, 1.94 ERA, 25 SO) with Willie McCovey. In 1960, he had a win\u2013loss record of 20-9 with a 3.08 earned run average. He led the National League in complete games, made the All-Star team, and won the Cy Young Award that season. In the 1960 World Series, he won two games to help the Pirates defeat the New York Yankees. His career was derailed by an injury to his ankle sustained on the bus trip on which the team was celebrating clinching the 1960 pennant. Law was forced to change his pitching style and pitched in pain for the rest of the season and the World Series. Because of his weak ankle, he tore some muscles in the back of his pitching shoulder during the Series. He thought the injury would heal over the winter, but he was not the same for several seasons. Law did manage to win the NL Comeback Player of the Year award in 1965, with a 17-9 record, and a 2.15 ERA in 29\u00a0games.  He shared the NL Player of the Month award in June of that year (with Willie Stargell), with a 6-1 record, 0.87\u00a0ERA, and 32 SO.  After two more seasons, he retired in 1967. Law finished his career with a record of 162-147. He won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award in 1965 for his contributions both on and off the field. As a hitter, Law  posted a .216 batting average (191-for-883) with 96 runs, 35 doubles, 7 triples, 11 home runs, 90 RBI and drawing 41 bases on balls. In the 1960 World Series, he batted .333 (2-for-6) with a run scored and one RBI. He was better than average defensively, recording a .972 fielding percentage, which was 16 points higher than the league average at his position."

His first professional team was the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League, where he played from 1974 to 1976. He began his NFL career with the New York Giants and is best remembered for his role in the November 19, 1978, game where the Giants, ahead 17\u201312 with only seconds to play and their opponent out of time-outs, lost after his handoff (a play called by offensive coordinator Bob Gibson over Pisarcik's objections) to Larry Csonka was fumbled and returned for a touchdown by Herman Edwards of the Philadelphia Eagles. The play has since been referred to as \"The Fumble\" by Giants fans and \"The Miracle at the Meadowlands\" by Eagles fans, and it was instrumental in making the Quarterback kneel (also known as \"taking a knee\") a routine play for running down the clock at the end of a game. Pisarcik was traded to the Eagles in 1980 for a 6th round pick, primarily serving as the backup to QB Ron Jaworski. He stayed with the Eagles until retiring after the 1984 season. A resident of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Pisarcik has five children:  Kristin, Lindsey, Jake, Joseph and Katie. Jake is an offensive lineman for the University of Oregon. Pisarcik served as the CEO of the NFL Alumni Association in Newark. He retired in April 2017. Pisarcik was later sued by three women who alleged sexual harassment."

With eight goals in 32 games he was the AaB top goalscorer of the 2009\u201310 Danish Superliga season. As his contract expired in the summer 2010, AaB did not have the financial means to extend it. In June 2010, Johansson signed with Odense Boldklub on a free transfer."

He was once more a part of the Swedish team in the February 2007 game against Egypt, and played his 13th national team game. While at AaB, he was called up for the Swedish squad to replace Freddie Ljungberg in September 2007. He played his 16th and last national team game in January 2008, before he was dropped from the team again. He impressed Swedish manager Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck in his Champions League games for AaB, and was called up once more in September 2008, but did not play. Johansson's favored position as an offensive central midfielder did not exist in Lagerb\u00e4ck's rigid 4\u20134\u20132 system, and Johansson's international career suffered as a result."

He had been selected in the 4th round, 83rd overall, of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft following a successful career in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League with the Granby Bisons. Montreal already had established first team duo Patrick Roy and Brian Hayward who had won three William M. Jennings Trophy in a row from 1986 to 1989. As a result, Racicots first season was spent largely on the Sherbrooke Canadiens farm team, but he finally made his NHL debut on December 9, 1989, against the Toronto Maple Leafs, were he allowed three goals on six shots in just less than 13 minutes before being replaced. It was his only NHL appearance of the 1989\u201390 NHL season. He shared the Harry \"Hap\" Holmes Memorial Award for fewest goals allowed in the AHL in 1990 with fellow understudy Jean-Claude Bergeron. The 1990\u201391 season saw regular understudy Haywards traded to the Minnesota North Stars. As a result, Racicot split time with the Fredericton Canadiens and Montreal, as he battled with Jean-Claude Bergeron and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chabot for second string duties. The following 1991\u201392 season saw Roland Melanson brought in as an experienced backup, reducing Racicots opportunities significantly as he again spent a large portion of the season with Federicton. In his 9 appearances for Montreal he was winless, while Roy appeared in 67 games to earn another Jennings Trophy. In 1992-93 Racicot had his most successful season for Montreal. While Roy appeared in the lions share of games (62 of the 84 possible) Racicot saw action in 26 games, winning 17. The Canadiens made their way to the Stanley Cup Final. Racicot saw only 18 minutes of action in the playoffs as Roy backstopped the unfancied Montreal to their first Stanley Cup win since 1986. The following year Racicot again faced competition for his second string position, with Ron Tugnutt and Les Kuntar splitting playing time. His performances dipped, and ultimately he was released at the end of the 1994 season. Racicot left the NHL after the 1994 season, spending several seasons with various teams in the AHL, International Hockey League, and East Coast Hockey League. The 1999\u20132000 season saw Racicot move to Russia, playing in 20 games with HC Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk before returning to North America for another five seasons of minor-pro hockey. He retired as a player in 2004."

Afterwards he went to IFK Mariehamn and IF Brommapojkarna, before being signed by West Ham at the age of just 16, after impressive displays for Finland's youth teams. In 2000 Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier agreed to pay \u00a31 million for the talented forward in a deal that also saw Rigobert Song going the other way. After failing to get into the first team at Liverpool, Sj\u00f6lund joined Djurg\u00e5rden for the 2003 season, first on loan and later on a permanent deal. He has won two Swedish championships and two Swedish Cups with Djurg\u00e5rden. The 2005 season finally saw Sj\u00f6lund become a regular in the Djurg\u00e5rden team, and he scored seven goals in the league. A regular for the Under-21s since the age of 17, Sj\u00f6lund made his senior international debut for the Finnish national team on 22 May 2003 against Norway. Good performances in the 2005 season have seen him promoted to the senior team on a regular basis. Sj\u00f6lund was also a part of the Finland squad at the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship.

Sj\u00f6lund signed with \u00c5tvidabergs FF on 4 February 2013 and stayed with the club for two seasons. He signed a pre-contract with local rivals IFK Norrk\u00f6ping during the 2014 season, and joined the squad for the 2015 season. Sj\u00f6lund re-signed with IFK Mariehamn for the 2019 season.

Afterward, with Cairns in the penalty box, Fleury mocked him by flapping his arms like a chicken to suggest that Cairns was afraid to fight McCarthy, who flexed his biceps and looked at Cairns.  In the next game between the two teams, on December 21, Cairns and McCarthy fought at the beginning of the first period following an early Islanders goal.  Cairns won the fight, and McCarthy said of him after the game, \"I never said he wasn't a tough guy.\" In another incident on February 19, 2004, Dale Purinton beat Cairns in a fight and punched him after he was down on the ice.

Cairns and Purinton came together, and as Cairns began to throw punches, Purinton elbowed Cairns in the face before Purinton dropped to the ice and turtled.

        "content": "Aubin was born in Montreal, Quebec. As a youth, he played in the 1990 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Mercier, Quebec. Aubin played his junior career in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, following in the footsteps of so many other Quebec-born goaltenders. He played for three different teams, spending the most time with the Sherbrooke Faucons. He was drafted in the third round of the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, 76th overall, by the Pittsburgh Penguins. His professional career began in the East Coast Hockey League, but he worked his way on to the Penguins' farm team, and then into the NHL itself. In the 1998\u201399 season, Aubin was recalled by the Penguins and made his NHL debut in a 5-0 defeat to the Tampa Bay Lightning on  October 21, 1998. Two weeks later Aubin recorded his first career win on November 5, in a 4-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators. In his next start Aubin continued his form, collecting his first career shutout in a scoreless tie against the Boston Bruins on November 7, 1998. Aubin played parts of six seasons with Pittsburgh, including one as their starting goaltender, before being released by them. He then signed a two-way contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs.  He played his first game with the Maple Leafs on March 26, 2006 on New Jersey, making 36 saves and winning the game 4\u20133.  He recorded a shutout in only his third game with the Maple Leafs, against the Buffalo Sabres in a 7\u20130 victory on home ice. After spending the majority of the 2007\u201308 season with the Los Angeles Kings, he was traded to the Anaheim Ducks at the 2008 trading deadline for a seventh round pick. It was the first-ever transaction involving the two geographic- and Pacific Division-rival clubs. On July 23, 2009, Aubin signed a one-year contract with European team, the DEG Metro Stars leaving the Philadelphia Phantoms. In his first season with the Metro Stars in 2009\u201310, Aubin recorded the best save percentage and was subsequently selected as the DEL Goalie of the Year. After three seasons with the Metro Stars, Aubin departed as a free agent but remained in Europe, signing a one-year contract with Pustertal-Val Pusteria Wolves of the Italian Serie A on June 3, 2012."

He took part in the 1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League qualification games against Scottish team Rangers in September 1992, and moved to play in Scotland shortly thereafter. He joined Dundee in the Scottish Premier Division, but could not prevent the club from being relegated to the Scottish League Division One at the end of the 1993\u201394 season. They reached the 1995 Scottish League Cup Final in November 1995, but lost to Aberdeen. Wieghorst also lost the 1994 Scottish Challenge Cup Final with Dundee. He made 109 appearances and scored 17 goals in his time with the club. He moved on to Premier Division team Celtic in December 1995. Injuries partly ruined his first two seasons in Glasgow. In the 1997\u201398 season, Wieghorst played 31 of 36 league matches for Celtic as the club won its 36th Scottish championship to end \"Old Firm\" archrivals Rangers' nine-year stranglehold on the title. In 2000, Wieghorst was diagnosed with the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and following treatment he spent a year in recovery before returning to play in a November 2001 Scottish Cup game.

He was a part of the Denmark squad that won the 1995 King Fahd Cup, where he came on as a substitute to replace the injured team captain Michael Laudrup in the 2\u20130 final win against Argentina. During his injured first seasons at Celtic, Wieghorst's international career went on a hiatus. After his return to the Celtic team, Wieghorst became a mainstay in the Denmark national team from October 1997. He was selected to represent Denmark at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and played three games at the tournament. Most remarkably, he came on as a substitute in the 82nd minute of the 1\u20131 draw with South Africa, only to be sent off three minutes later. In Denmark's ultimate qualification game for the 2000 European Championship, he scored in the 3\u20132 victory against Italy which secured Denmark's qualification for the main tournament. Having been brought on as a substitute in the 52nd minute, he scored to level the game at 2\u20132 in the 57th minute, before he was sent-off for his second yellow card in the 80th minute. This made him the only Denmark national team player to have been sent-off more than once. In October 1999, Wieghorst's national team career came to a halt again, due to his illness. Wieghorst re-entered the Denmark national team in August 2002, while playing for Br\u00f8ndby, as he played the 1\u20130 friendly match win against Scotland. In February 2003, he was selected for the Denmark League XI national football team, consisting of the best Danish players in the Superliga, to play a series of unofficial friendly matches against various Asian national teams. In the game against Iran, an Iranian player mistook a whistle from the crowd as being the referee's half-time signal, and picked the ball up with his hands in the penalty area. The referee gave a penalty kick, but following consultation with national team coach Morten Olsen, Wieghorst missed the penalty on purpose as a token of fair play, and Denmark XI lost 1\u20130. The incident made CNN's \"Play of the Day\" of 2 February 2003, and Wieghorst received an Olympic Committee fair play award. He was selected the 2003 Danish Player of the Year. He played his last national team game in April 2004, a 1\u20130 friendly match win against Scotland."

Wesley began his NHL career with the Boston Bruins, whom he played for from 1987 to 1994. He earned a berth on the 1988 All-Rookie team. He reached the Stanley Cup Finals twice with the Bruins, in 1988 and 1990, though the Bruins lost both series to the Edmonton Oilers. As a rookie in the 1988 Finals, Wesley scored two goals in Game Four, a contest which would eventually be suspended due to power failure at Boston Garden. His dramatic last-minute goal in Game Five of the 1990 playoffs against Montreal would help the Bruins reach the Finals for the second time in three years. Prior to the start of the 1994-95 season, Wesley was traded to the Hartford Whalers for their first-round draft picks in 1995, 1996, and 1997. With the picks, the Bruins drafted Kyle McLaren (1995), Johnathan Aitken (1996) and Sergei Samsonov (1997), the latter of whom was Wesley's teammate in his final year in the NHL. Wesley moved with the Whalers to Carolina in 1997 and quickly became a leader. In 2002, he reached the Stanley Cup Finals for a third time. In March 2003, nearing the trade deadline, he was traded from Carolina to Toronto, joining the Maple Leafs for the rest of the 2002\u20132003 season in an effort for both teams to make the Stanley Cup playoffs. He re-signed with the Hurricanes at the end of the season. He got his fourth trip to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Edmonton Oilers. This would be Wesley's third time playing against the Oilers. Wesley won his first Stanley Cup on June 19, 2006 with the Hurricanes, defeating Edmonton in seven games, which is his childhood favorite team. When he won this, he ended one of the longest streaks for active players who had not yet won a Stanley Cup. Wesley played two more seasons with the Hurricanes before retiring, leaving him as the only player to have played in each of the Hurricanes' first 10 seasons since the team relocated to North Carolina. On June 5, 2008 Wesley announced his retirement after his 20th NHL season, and his 10th with the Carolina Hurricanes. He remains in the Hurricanes organization as Director of Defensemen Development. The Hurricanes retired Wesley's No. 2 jersey February 17, 2009, against the Boston Bruins, who Wesley began his NHL career with. Wesley was the only player to don #2 with the Hurricanes, as the number was previously retired by the Hartford Whalers in honor of Rick Ley. When the franchise relocated, Wesley changed his number from #20 to #2, marking the distinction of the number being retired by the same franchise for two different players in two different cities."

He was traded by the Leafs for veteran defenceman Drake Berehowsky at the trade deadline. During the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout, Jackman played for Bj\u00f6rkl\u00f6ven in the Swedish Allsvenskan.

After parts of five seasons in the NHL, Jackman opted to sign overseas with EC Red Bull Salzburg in Austria in the summer of 2007. He also played for Leksand of Allsvenskan in Sweden and Biel of the Swiss-A league. In 2010, he accepted a special invitation to play for the Utah Grizzlies (ECHL) prior to joining HC Slovan Bratislava in Slovak Extraliga.

With Ha\u0161ek leaving in the midst of game three of the first round, Shields was forced to step in but he helped the Sabres to rally and defeat the Ottawa Senators. Shields then played the second round series against the Philadelphia Flyers, as Ha\u0161ek was suspended for three games after an altercation with reporter Jim Kelley. A line brawl between the two teams broke out in game one that resulted in a memorable goaltender fight between Shields and the Flyers' Garth Snow. Ha\u0161ek was set to return in game four with the team down by three games in the series, but he told the Sabres' coaching staff he felt a twinge in his knee and left the ice after the pregame skate. Shields turned in another season-saving performance as Buffalo staved off the almost inevitable sweeping elimination with a win. Again before the fifth game, Ha\u0161ek declared himself unfit to play and Shields would finish the series with Buffalo losing 6\u20133 and being eliminated."

He signed for Sunderland in January 2017, and left by mutual consent in March 2018. In 2007, Gibson was at the centre of a dispute between the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) and the Irish Football Association (IFA), after he opted to play for the Republic of Ireland instead of Northern Ireland. The issue was referred to FIFA and was discussed in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The issue was settled in 2010 when it was declared that Northern Ireland-born people are entitled to play for either the Republic or Northern Ireland.

A former pupil of St Columb's College, he played junior football in the Derry and District League, and then with Institute before joining Manchester United in 2004. He made his senior debut for United on 26 October 2005 in a League Cup match against Barnet, coming on as a substitute for Lee Martin. During the 2005\u201306 season he played regularly for Manchester United Reserves, helping them win a treble. He made 19 appearances, scoring twice. In May 2006, he won the prestigious Jimmy Murphy Award as United's youth player of the year and then played regularly for the United senior team during their pre-season summer matches, together with Dong Fangzhuo, Jonny Evans, Fraizer Campbell and Danny Simpson. Gibson was one of several United players who spent the 2006\u201307 season on loan at Royal Antwerp. In October 2007, he was loaned out again, this time to Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he spent the majority of the 2007\u201308 season. At Wolves he scored once, against Burnley on 8 December 2007. Gibson made his Premier League debut on 15 November 2008, appearing as a second-half substitute against Stoke City, before making his UEFA Champions League debut ten days later, coming on as a substitute for Darren Fletcher against Villarreal on 25 November 2008. In December 2008, he travelled with the United squad to the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where, despite not making any appearances, he picked up a winners' medal. On 4 January 2009, Gibson scored his first goal for the club, United's third in a 3\u20130 victory over Southampton in the FA Cup third round. On 1 March 2009, Gibson started in the centre of midfield alongside Paul Scholes against Tottenham Hotspur in the 2009 League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, playing the full initial 90 minutes before being replaced by Ryan Giggs at the start of extra time as Manchester United went on to win 4\u20131 on penalties. On 24 May, he scored his first league goal for Manchester United in the last match of the 2008\u201309 Premier League season against Hull City. Gibson was rewarded with a three-year extension to his Manchester United contract, tying him to the club until at least 2012. Gibson was one of a number of young United players who came under criticism when they lost a four-year unbeaten home record in Europe, losing 1\u20130 to Be\u015fikta\u015f at Old Trafford. On 1 December 2009, six days on from the defeat in the Champions League, Gibson responded to the criticism by scoring both of United's goals in a 2\u20130 win against Tottenham to send United through the semi-finals of the League Cup. Gibson was granted a starting place in the Champions League second leg quarter-final tie against Bayern Munich and scored a long-range shot after only three minutes, his first goal in a UEFA competition, but despite winning the match 3\u20132, they were knocked out by Bayern on away goals with the aggregate score ending 4\u20134. He scored his first goal of the 2010\u201311 season as he netted the first of United's goals in a 5\u20132 away win over Scunthorpe United in the League Cup. In February 2011, Gibson's national team manager, Giovanni Trapattoni, told him that he must leave Manchester United in order to further his career. Gibson scored in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final as United beat Schalke 4\u20131 (6\u20131 on aggregate) but he was one of a number of players from that match alongside Rafael, Evans, O'Shea and Berbatov who could not make the substitutes bench for the Champions League final, which United lost 3\u20131 to Barcelona. Sunderland agreed a transfer fee with United to sign Gibson in the summer of 2011, but Gibson could not agree personal terms. He subsequently only made two appearances for the club in the 2011\u201312 season, despite there being a number of midfielders out injured at Old Trafford, and left the club in January 2012."

Later that month, Gibson scored his first goal for the club in a 1\u20130 home win against league leaders Manchester City. Gibson played 11 times in the league during his first season with the club and did not finish on the losing side once. If his time at Manchester United is taken into account this figure is stretched to 28 consecutive league matches without defeat. The run came to an end in Everton's third league match of the 2012\u201313 season, when Gibson started in a 0\u20132 loss to West Bromwich Albion, although the match was level at 0\u20130 when Gibson was substituted in the first half due to injury.

On 13 April 2013, Gibson scored his first goal of the season in a 2\u20130 home win against Queens Park Rangers. His impact on Everton in his first two seasons was such that the club won 52% of the matches he played in and only 25% of those he did not, with Gibson being hailed as the key link between attack and defence. Gibson only made one league appearance during the 2013\u201314 season as it was ended in October when he suffered serious cruciate knee ligament damage whilst on international duty. On 8 November 2016, Gibson captained Everton's under-23 team in their elimination from the EFL Trophy by Blackpool."

The general principle or article 5 of FIFA's Regulations Governing the Application of the Statutes states that \"any person holding a permanent nationality that is not dependent on residence in a certain country is eligible to play for the representative teams of the Association of that country\". Due to the constitutional position of Northern Ireland following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, citizenship of the Republic of Ireland is the undisputed birthright of every person born on the island of Ireland if they so wish, so long as at least one parent is an Irish or British citizen or, failing that, a permanent resident. As a result, Gibson was approached to represent both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland at international level."

On 14 November 2006, he also played for Republic of Ireland B in a 0\u20130 draw against Scotland B. In 2007, Gibson was included in several senior Republic of Ireland squads for Euro 2008 qualifiers, before he eventually made his debut in a 4\u20130 win against Denmark. During the away friendly, he came on as half-time substitute, replacing Andy Reid. In the 54th minute, Gibson fired a shot from outside the penalty area that the Danish keeper, Jesper Christiansen, could only palm away, allowing Shane Long to follow up and score the Republic's third goal. Gibson won his second full cap on 8 September 2007 in an away match against Slovakia. The Euro 2008 qualifier, which finished as a 2\u20132 draw, saw him again used as substitute, this time replacing Aiden McGeady after 61 minutes. Gibson made his first start for the Republic of Ireland national team in a 1\u20130 win at home to Cyprus on 15 October 2008. After Steven Reid dropped out of the Irish squad due to injury, Gibson was called up to provide extra physicality in the centre of the Irish midfield. Manager Giovanni Trapattoni also cited Gibson's confidence on the football pitch as the reason for choosing him ahead of Liam Miller and Andy Reid. On 8 February 2011, Gibson scored his first goal for his country, a shot from long range in a 3\u20130 victory over Wales in the first match of the 2011 Nations Cup. Gibson was selected in the Ireland squad for UEFA Euro 2012.  However, he was an unused substitute for all of Ireland's matches as the team was knocked out in the group stage with three successive defeats. On 1 September 2012, Gibson was included in Ireland's squad to play Kazakhstan in a 2014 World Cup qualifier.  However, he withdrew from the squad citing disappointment at his lack of playing time during Euro 2012. On 8 March 2013, he again turned down a call up for Ireland's World Cup qualifiers against Sweden and Austria. On 30 September 2013, Gibson was recalled to the Republic of Ireland squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Germany and Kazakhstan by interim manager Noel King. After starting the 3\u20130 defeat to Germany he was stretchered off with a suspected knee injury in the next match against Kazakhstan which ruled him out for the rest of the season. On 3 September 2014, Gibson made a start for the Republic of Ireland after recovering from his long term knee injury when his team beat Oman 2\u20130. On 11 October, he made his first competitive appearance for Ireland in more than a year, playing the full 90 minutes in the team's 7\u20130 UEFA Euro 2016 qualification defeat of Gibraltar."

They also challenged for the 1993\u201394 Scottish Premier Division title, eventually finishing third. His spell at Raith Rovers in 1996 was remarkable for lasting only six days and encompassing only one game; the lure of working under Jim, by then chairman of Dundee United, saw him quit Stark's Park for Tannadice amidst substantial acrimony.

The highlight of his time at Vale Park was on 26 September 2006 against Nottingham Forest, he scored within 14 seconds \u2013 the fastest goal of that season. He was released by Port Vale in July 2007, and joined Macclesfield Town, where he became Ian Brightwell's first signing as manager. He joined Telford United of the Conference North on a one-month loan in November, which was extended by a month after he impressed at New Bucks Head, before the loan was eventually extended until the end of the season. Husbands made 25 appearances for the Shropshire side scoring three times. He rejected the opportunity to sign permanently at the end of the campaign and so after a trial at Cheltenham Town in July, he opted to join Oxford United in the Conference National in August 2008. Manager Darren Patterson urged him to make the most of this opportunity, saying, \"For whatever reason he's had lots of clubs, but you can see his sharpness. Maybe this is the last chance saloon for Michael. He needs a club where he plays regularly and scores goals.\" However, he was released by Oxford at the end of the month after his contract expired. After leaving the professional game, Husbands joined the Royal Marines. He made his debut for the Marines football team against the Devon & Somerset Fire Service on 18 May 2010, scoring twice in the game. In December 2012, he returned to English football with Southern League club Redditch United."

        "content": "Tai Lamar Streets (born April 20, 1977) is a former professional American football wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected with the second pick of the sixth round of the 1999 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers. He also played for the Detroit Lions in 2004. He was the leading receiver for the national champion 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team. Over the course of his career he was notable for fourth quarter performances in various bowl games and NFL playoff games.  As a professional athlete, he was known for his modesty. As an amateur athlete, he was known as one of the best high school athletes in the Chicago metropolitan area. In high school, he was an All-American in football and as a senior led his team to a 9\u20130 regular season before losing in the playoffs. In basketball, he was an All-State selection by numerous publications and led his team past Kevin Garnett's high school team to reach the finals of the state championship playoff tournament. Despite losing in the finals, he was the highest votegetter on the All-tournament team.  In track, he was a state long jump champion as a junior and runner-up as a senior when he also helped his school's 4 x 400 metres relay team finish third in the state. In 1995, he was widely regarded as the best high school athlete in the Chicago metropolitan area, winning athlete of the year awards from the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times and Illinois High School Association.  He is considered to be one of the greatest three-sport athletes in the history of Illinois. Streets led the Michigan Wolverines football team in receiving yards each season from 1996\u20131998.  He had two touchdown receptions in the 1998 Rose Bowl, which clinched a share of the national championship.  During his years as the primary receiver, there were quarterback controversies each year with battles among Brian Griese, Scott Dreisbach, Tom Brady and Drew Henson. As a senior, he was voted football team MVP and All-Big Ten Conference second-team wide receiver.  That season, he posted five 100-yard games and totaled over one thousand yards.  He played in the Senior Bowl and was selected for the Hula Bowl.  He was injured right before the 1999 draft causing him to slip from a projected second-round selection to a sixth-round choice.  As a sophomore, he played part of the season for the 1996\u201397 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team, which won the 1997 National Invitation Tournament, but has since vacated the championship due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal. Streets had modest success as a professional in five seasons with the 49ers.  He began as a fourth wide receiver on a team with perennial Pro Bowl receivers Jerry Rice and Terrell Owens, but he eventually became a starter before moving on to play his final season with the Lions.  His career was highlighted by playoff performances in which he caught at least four receptions for at least 50 yards in all three playoff games.  He recorded two fourth quarter playoff touchdowns one of which was the game-winner in a 24-point comeback victory and the other of which was a game-tying touchdown in a losing effort."

        "content": "After Streets' parents separated, he lived with his mother in Matteson. She started him in track, which quickly supplanted baseball, which he last played at age 12.  At Rich South High School of Richton Park, Illinois he participated initially in basketball and track with basketball in his sights for professional success.  As a sophomore, Streets briefly played halfback for the football team, but he broke his ankle in a freak accident after the second game, and vowed never to return. Rich South coach Hud Venerable, who had seen videotapes of Streets, set out to bring him back as a junior.  He attempted to recruit Streets by attending his basketball games and track meets. He knew Streets wanted to play wide receiver. He realized football could provide a better college opportunity than basketball, especially for a  athlete such as himself.  After he returned to football, he became widely known in all three sports. As a sophomore in 1992\u201393, Streets scored 20 points and posted 12 rebounds in his first varsity basketball game for Rich South  on January 22, 1993.  The team finished that season with a 14\u201310 record.  That same season, Streets won the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) triple jump championship. As a junior, he helped the team compile a 26\u20132 record as it entered the sectional finals.  In track, he won the Class AA state championship in the long jump on his final jump of  and was leading in the triple jump with a jump of  until Byron Topps leapt to a state record of . During his junior year, he was recognized, along with fellow future professional football player Donovan McNabb, as one of the 16 best boy athletes in the Chicago metropolitan area by the Chicago Sun-Times for his efforts in high school football, basketball and track.  That spring he was also selected as one of the ten best football prospects in the Chicago area by high school athlete expert Tom Lemming for his play at wide receiver. College coaches who recruit in the Chicago area selected him as one of the top 16 1994 football prospects.  One recruiting service rated him as one of the top five football prospects in Illinois and one of the top three wide receiver prospects in the United States. During the summer between his junior and senior year Streets was selected as to the All-Tournament team for the AAU 17 & under men's basketball National Invitational Tournament held in Kenner, Louisiana. Streets moved in with his dad and transferred to Thornton Township High School. At the time of his 1994 senior year transfer to Harvey, Illinois's Thornton, Streets was described by a Chicago Sun-Times journalist as \"the best high school athlete in Illinois\".  The Sun-Times chose him as one of the six best football prospects in the area and as an All-Area Offensive selection before his senior season. He was a preseason All-American in football.  Lemming named him as one of the top 100 senior prospects in the nation. By this time, Lemming considered him to be the best high school wide receiver in Illinois.  According to Sporting News, Streets and Randy Moss were among the four best wide receivers in the nation.  National Recruiting Advisor listed him fifth behind Peter Warrick, Moss, Mondriel Fulcher, and Corey Jones. Streets and sophomore quarterback Antwaan Randle El helped Thornton snap Homewood-Flossmoor High School's 44-game conference winning streak in the SICA East in football.  Over the course of the season he helped Thornton achieve a 9\u20130 record on its way to the Class 6A state playoffs.  Although Streets accumulated nine receptions for 145 yards in the playoff game, he only had one touchdown in the waning moments and was kept from making gamebreaking plays when it mattered. He ended the season as a Chicago Tribune second-team All-state selection.  In high school, he aspired to have a broadcasting career after athletics like his role model Ahmad Rash\u0101d and also had visions of Olympic Games competition.  As late as December of his senior year, he was considering Michigan, Illinois, Notre Dame, Wisconsin and South Carolina. In January 1995, he selected the University of Michigan because of its tradition of producing National Football League wide receivers such as Anthony Carter, Derrick Alexander, Desmond Howard and Chris Calloway.  Streets was part of a Michigan football recruiting class that included Tom Brady and Charles Woodson. Streets was selected to play in the Chicago Public League Football Coaches Association eighth annual Harold Washington All-Star Football Game.  In the 12th annual Suburban All-Star Football Classic, Streets caught a 37-yard fly pattern for the game-winning touchdown. During his senior basketball season, he was named by the Chicago Tribune as a Prep Athlete of the Week for leading Thornton to victory over Champaign, Illinois' Centennial High School, the 12th ranked school in the state.  After the regular season, he was a member of the Chicago Sun-Times All-Area team as well as their Class AA All-State team headlined by Player of the Year Kevin Garnett.  He was also selected to the Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette All-state team.  Eventually, Streets was named to all five notable All-State teams. In the state playoffs, Streets helped lead Thornton to victory over Garnett's number-one-ranked Farragut Academy team, which also included Ronnie Fields and Michael Wright, in the Class AA state quarterfinals.  In the championship game, Streets had a game-high 15 rebounds in a losing effort against Manual High School as Thornton finished with a 30\u20132 record.  Streets was the highest vote-getter on the Associated Press Class AA all-tournament team.  He was selected to play in the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association all-star game. Streets scored 12 points and had 10 rebounds in the game. Streets was also selected as a member of the Chicago Suburban All-Stars.  He placed fourth in the 1995 Illinois Mr. Basketball selection that Garnett won in a landslide. USA Today recognized him as an honorable mention All-USA selection.  He was part of a Michigan Wolverines men's basketball incoming number-one ranked recruiting class with three McDonald's All-Americans: Robert Traylor, Albert White, and Louis Bullock. During his 1995 senior track season, he ran a sub-21 second 200 meter in the SICA East Conference championship meet. In the sectional state championship meet qualifier, Streets posted a long jump of  and a triple jump of . The Illinois High School Association (IHSA) championship meet record of  set in 1969 seemed in jeopardy. On the first day of the long jump competition, Streets posted a , which was second to the leader's , and neither athlete improved his jump on the second day, leaving Streets as the second-place finisher. Streets also ran a 47\u00a0split for his leg of the third-place 4 x 400 metres relay team at the state meet. He graduated in the class of 1995.  His high school basketball teams included future professional athletes Randle El, Melvin Ely, and Napoleon Harris.  As a senior, Streets won the Chicago Sun-Times all sport 1994\u201395 high school athlete of the year award. He also was named Chicago Tribune March 1995 Athlete of the Month and 1994\u201395 Chicago Tribune Athlete of the Year, which was awarded June 21, 1995 at Comiskey Park. Streets was also honored as the IHSA Sports Report Athlete of the Year. Daily Herald of Arlington Heights, Illinois said that Streets would have won their Athlete of the Year award had he competed in their coverage area.  Streets was so highly regarded as an athlete that the Thornton baseball coach repeatedly extended him an open offer to pitch for the baseball team."

        "content": "Streets played college football and basketball at the University of Michigan. As a true freshman in the 1995 NCAA Division I-A football season, Streets only caught five passes for the 1995 Michigan Wolverines football team: he caught three in the 52\u201317 October 28 Little Brown Jug rivalry game victory against the Minnesota Golden Gophers and two in the 31\u201323 November 25 Michigan \u2013 Ohio State rivalry game with the Ohio State Buckeyes.  All five athletes who had more receptions than him that season went on to play professional football (Mercury Hayes \u2212 48, Amani Toomer \u2013 44, Jay Riemersma \u2013 41, Chris Howard \u2013 14 and Jerame Tuman \u2013 9).  Hayes, Toomer and Riemersma, who accounted for 75 percent of the team's yardage, were all selected in the 1996 NFL Draft, leaving Streets as the leading returning wide receiver (Howard was a running back and Tuman was a tight end). In 1996, Michigan dealt with a starting quarterback returning from a season-ending injury and a depleted receiving group: Scott Dreisbach had missed the final two-thirds of the season, leaving Brian Griese as the starter and freshman Tom Brady served as an understudy.  Streets earned the starting wide receiver job and started in all twelve games.  He led the 1996 Michigan Wolverines football team in receptions and reception yardage with 44 receptions for 730 yards.  In the first game of the season against Illinois, Streets made the key block on Dreisbach's 72-yard touchdown run.  Two weeks later he made key catches on both the game-tying and game-winning scoring drives against the Colorado Buffaloes.  His best statistical performance came at home in Cook County, Illinois in front of a large gathering of friends and family against Northwestern when he recorded 12 receptions for 150\u00a0yards in an October 5, 17\u201316 loss.  This first appearance in the Chicago area would be his collegiate career-best in terms of single-game receptions.  The 12 receptions was a school record, but it was overshadowed by a fumble that changed the momentum of the game. Streets caught two touchdown passes both in rivalry games: the opening score from Dreisbach in the 44\u201310 victory against Minnesota and the only touchdown in a 13\u20139 victory over Ohio State from Griese.  In his sophomore year, after the football season ended with the January 1, 1997 Outback Bowl game, he joined the Michigan Wolverines basketball team in the last week of January and made his debut in a February 1, 1997 game against Michigan State.  The team went on to win the 1997 National Invitation Tournament on March 27 that season, and Streets played a few minutes in four of the five games.  However, due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal the championship has been vacated.  After the basketball season ended, Streets rejoined the football team for Spring practice, and he led all receivers with four receptions for 125 yards in the annual spring game on April 12. According to his mother, during the summer prior to his 1997 junior year, Streets dedicated himself to weight training like he never had before in an effort to end a Rose Bowl draught that made the 1997 Wolverines the first since the 1969 team to have no Rose Bowl veterans.  Although Streets and Russell Shaw were the starting receivers, it was understood that Charles Woodson, who was regarded as one of the most versatile athletes in college football, was expected to play on offense that season. However, it was not clear whether Dreisbach, Brady or Griese would quarterback the team. Griese was named starter shortly before the season opener.  It was believed that a solid season by any of the quarterbacks could lead to a productive season by Streets and the receivers. Streets' first touchdown of the season was a 41-yard game-tying catch from Griese in a 21\u201314 September 27 victory in the rivalry game against Notre Dame.  During the season, Streets dislocated both thumbs, with the second injury occurring in the November 1 Little Brown Jug game against Minnesota.  Streets caught no passes against either Minnesota or Penn State the following week.  His production drought was notable and he recovered on November 15 with five catches for 108\u00a0yards including a 38-yard touchdown from Griese on November 15 against Wisconsin.  Although the injury-hampered Streets went without a catch in three of the last four regular season games he caught touchdown passes of 53 and 58 yards and drew a key pass interference penalty in the 1998 Rose Bowl.  The Rose Bowl performance was Streets' season-high with 127 receiving yards and two touchdowns.  It helped solidify Michigan's case as the Bowl Alliance national champion. In 1998, Streets' returned for his senior season with several experienced receivers including 1997 All-American tight end Tuman.  The 1998 Michigan Wolverines football team entered the season with a quarterback battle between Brady, Driesbach and Drew Henson and wide receiver battle between David Terrell and Marquise Walker. In the season September 5 opening game loss against Notre Dame, Streets caught 8 passes for 101 yards in the first half and Marcus Knight accounted for 126 of Michigan's 322 passing yards from Brady and Henson.  Streets had back-to-back 100 yard games in October: He posted 117\u00a0yards on eight receptions in the October 24 homecoming game against Indiana, and he had a career-high 192 yards against Minnesota on October 31. Against Ohio State, he caught Michigan's only touchdown in a 31\u201316 November 21 loss as part of a 9 catch and 118\u00a0yard effort. In the game-tying touchdown drive in the fourth quarter of the 1999 Florida Citrus Bowl victory over Arkansas, Streets caught a 15-yard completion on third-and-11 and the 8-yarder on fourth-and-2 on his way to a career-ending 7-catch 129-yard effort.  Streets caught a fourth-quarter touchdown pass and two-point conversion in the January 23, 1999 Senior Bowl, and he was on the January 24, 1999 Hula Bowl roster. As a senior, Streets totalled 1035\u00a0yards and 11 touchdowns on 76 receptions, and he was named team Most Valuable Player for the 1998 season.  Streets was voted to the All-Big Ten Second Team in 1998.  Streets remains second to Jack Clancy on the all-time Michigan single game receptions yardage list with 192. Streets led the Michigan receivers statistically for three consecutive years from 1996 \u2013 1998 (Yards 1996\u20131998, Receptions 1996 & 1998, Receiving touchdowns 1997\u20131998).  Streets finished his career at Michigan with 2284 yards and 19 touchdowns on 144 receptions. At the March NFL Combine, Streets ran the third fastest 40-yard dash in a time of 4.42 seconds. Streets was regarded as between the 6th and 8th best wide receiver in the 1999 NFL Draft according to most expert analyses in April.  However, he ruptured his right achilles tendon in a pickup basketball game prior to the draft and was expected to be sidelined for six to eight months. As a result, he was the twentieth wide receiver selected.  Streets, who was on crutches at the time of the draft, was relieved to have been drafted."

        "content": "The San Francisco 49ers, who had Jerry Rice, Terrell Owens, and J. J. Stokes, did not need a wide receiver right away and gambled on the projected 2nd-round selection with their sixth round pick.  Head coach Steve Mariucci said that the team had evaluated his prospect as an injured athlete and had determined him to be a good selection for later rounds despite his injury. Streets was the only 1999 draftee not to sign in July when the other draftees signed, but he signed just before the end of the month.  Just before the season started, Streets was placed on the reserve non-football injury list in order to make roster space for Na'il Benjamin and Damon Griffin.  Streets was activated onto the 53-man roster prior to week 13 of the season to replace the injured R. W. McQuarters. He activated for the gameday roster three weeks later for the final two games. In his second game, he caught his first two NFL receptions on the Monday Night Football season finale. When Streets had the chance to exhibit his skills during the 2000 NFL season for the 2000 49ers, he proved himself to be the only speed receiver with the ability to create big plays downfield, but he remained the fourth receiver.  During the season as the number four receiver, Streets caught a total of 19 receptions, and he caught four in both games Owens was inactive. In mid-December, Streets broke his tibia and ended his season two weeks prior to the end of the season. The game was Rice's last home game as a 49er and the day that Owens set the then-NFL record for single-game receptions, with 20. In the 2001 NFL season, Rice signed with the Oakland Raiders.  Streets became the number three receiver for the 2001 49ers behind Stokes and Owens that season. In the season opener against the Atlanta Falcons, Streets totaled 81 yards receiving as part of a 335-yard day by Garcia.  This was Streets' single-game season-high yardage total for the season. It included a 52-yard overtime catch on 3rd-and-5 in the game-winning drive, the longest reception of Streets' career and more yards than he would accumulate in any single game the rest of the season. Streets recorded his first career touchdown on December 2, 2001, against the Buffalo Bills. Over the course of the season, Streets started three games, and his total receptions and yards, compared to the prior season, increased from 19 to 28 and 287 to 345, respectively. The 2001\u201302 NFL playoffs were Streets' NFL playoff debut. In the team's only game against Green Bay, Streets tied for the team-high with four receptions and 50 yards, just two yards short of Stokes' 52-yard effort. Streets caught a fourth-quarter touchdown and game-tying two-point conversion in the game, but the 49ers yielded ten fourth quarter points to lose 25\u201315. In the 2002 NFL season, Stokes often performed the role of a tight end, and got injured clearing the way for Streets to start in some games for the 2002 49ers.  Streets started a total of 14 games that season.  He had eight receptions three times, but recorded no 100-yard games.  The final eight-reception game against the Arizona Cardinals on December 21 would prove to be Streets' career-high 90-yard game. The following week on the final Monday Night game of the regular season, Streets posted his first and only two-touchdown effort in a losing cause against the St. Louis Rams. That season, Streets posted his career-highs in yards (756) and receptions (72) and totaled five touchdowns for the first time. The 49ers' season continued into the 2002\u201303 NFL playoffs and Streets caught five receptions in both of the teams' playoff games, including a game-winning touchdown with one minute remaining in the January 5, 2003, 39\u201338 victory over the New York Giants. The Giants game was memorable for its 24-point comeback by the 49ers. Despite the natural glory of the game-winning catch, Streets remained a modest footnote in the press and humble with his friends.  After the season, Streets was a restricted free agent. He was expected to be signed and traded to another team before the 2003 NFL draft in order to improve the 49ers' draft position. The team replaced Mariucci with Dennis Erickson in February 2003.  Before the 2003 NFL season, Stokes, who at the end of 2002 had been struggling to hold on to the third receiver position, was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars. Streets started every game for the 2003 49ers.  His best performance in terms of receptions and yards was a December 14, 6-reception 89-yard day that included a 41-yard touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals, which was his longest reception of the season.  That season, he totaled 47 receptions and 595 yards as well as a career-high seven touchdowns. Over the course of the season he was slowed by knee tendinitis and after the season he wanted to return to the Midwest.  Streets along with Owens, starting quarterback Garcia and starting running back Garrison Hearst, and starting offensive linemen Derrick Deese and Ron Stone were all let go by the team that year.  That is regarded as the biggest release of offensive starters in NFL history by a team in a single season."

In the 2004 NFL Draft, the Lions drafted wide receiver Roy Williams with the seventh overall selection one year after drafting Rogers in the first round.  Williams and Rogers were projected as the starters with Streets considered the third receiver as the season began. Rogers broke his collarbone on the third play of the season and was lost for the entire year. Streets started 12 of the 13 games that he played for the 2004 Lions while accumulating 260 yards on 28 receptions. In the seventh game against the Dallas Cowboys on October 31, Roy Williams leveled Streets, who did not catch another pass in the game after the second quarter hit.  Streets did not return to practice until November 17. He was in the lineup on November 21, and caught a pass against the Minnesota Vikings.

After the season, he was an unrestricted free agent, due to his years of seniority.  The 49ers received a compensatory draft pick in the 2005 NFL Draft for losing Streets to free agency.  Instead of re-signing Streets, the Lions signed wide receiver Kevin Johnson in April 2005."

The very same day Healy was traded to the New York Rangers for a third round pick. Healy was a part of the Rangers' Stanley Cup winning team in 1993-94, and he played 68 playoff minutes that year. During the 1995\u201396 season, Healy won both the Rangers Good Guy Award and the Rangers Fan Club Ceil Saidel Award. At the time he won these awards, he was the Rangers' number-one goalie while Mike Richter was injured. Healy appeared on three video game covers during his career, his first being Electronic Arts' NHL Hockey in 1991, then in Jaleco's Pro Sport Hockey  and later Sega's NHL All-Star Hockey '95, both for the Sega Genesis (Healy also appeared on the cover of the Game Gear release of NHL All-Star Hockey).

At the start of the 2009\u201310 NHL season, he moved back to analyzing games for CBC's Hockey Night in Canada before he joined the NHL on Sportsnet crew in 2014. Healy created the \"Loch Ness Monster\" hockey analysis segment for TSN, in which he picked a player (or players) who was supposed to be a key player that night but did not turn out to be (the tagline being that the player is \"the monster you hear about but don't see\"). Bagpipes can be heard in the background and the chosen player is dubbed \"tonight's Nessie\". One notable occurrence was the March 29, 2008, broadcast of the Boston Bruins' 4-0 win over the Ottawa Senators, where Healy selected the entire Senators team that night as the \"Nessie\". The segment's title is a parody of fellow analyst Pierre McGuire's \"Monster\" segment, which focuses on a player's whose contributions have been particularly effective.

Three days later he had his first start for the club in a 1\u20131 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion, he had several chances to score during the match including a header that hit the woodwork. After the match, Cardiff's goalscorer, Lee Bullock said that Ledley had been brilliant in his first start; creating chances as well as having some himself. Manager Lennie Lawrence said that he thought Ledley hadn't been fazed at all by the occasion and didn't look like he was making his debut. Ledley's first goal for Cardiff came, on 2 November, in a 4\u20131 victory over West Ham. He brought the ball down from a cross before beating the keeper, Stephen Bywater, with a right foot drive. After this match Ledley's manager and teammates were again full of praise for the youngster. Striker Paul Parry said that Ledley's goal was brilliant and with the way he had been playing, creating so many chances for himself, it was no surprise that he had got his first goal. Manager Lawrence also said that he was impressed with other aspects of Ledley's play. He thought that Ledley had shown incredible maturity during the match, saying that Ledley had, \"an old head on a young pair of shoulders\". He was also impressed with Ledley's positional play, pointing out how Ledley had tracked back late in the match to cut out a scoring opportunity for West Ham United, when other defenders hadn't seen the danger. On 4 February 2005 he committed his future to Cardiff City, signing a new long-term contract with the club. This was shortly after he had won a call up to the Wales under-21 squad. A month later he scored a vital goal, to earn three points for Cardiff as they beat Sheffield United 1\u20130. Ledley's season ended in April as he suffered a fractured metatarsal bone in training. Before this he had played 32 times for Cardiff City and had also earned three Wales under-21 caps. His performances had provided a major boost for Cardiff City in what was a poor season for them as they were in relegation trouble at the bottom of the Championship and were suffering financial troubles as well. Lawrence said that he hoped Ledley would stay at Cardiff for the next few seasons and that he wouldn't be surprised if the 18-year-old earned a full Wales call-up in the near future."

On 7 October, Ledley was named Welsh clubman of the year for the second consecutive year. He scored his first goal of the 2008\u201309 season during a 2\u20131 win over Crystal Palace on 15 November when he fired in after returning to the pitch after receiving treatment due to a dislocated finger. The injury later required surgery and Ledley was expected to be out for around one month but managed to return in time to play against Swansea City, with his finger in a cast, in the first league meeting between the two sides for nine years and scored with a left footed volley as the game ended 2\u20132, a goal which later earned him the club's goal of the season award. In his next game after the South Wales derby, on 6 December 2008, with captain Darren Purse dropped and vice-captain Stephen McPhail suspended, Ledley, at the age of just 21, captained Cardiff City for the first time in a 2\u20130 win over Preston North End. His performances in the absence of McPhail, which later earned him the Championship player of the month award for January, meant that he kept the Irish international out of the side as he continued as stand in captain, including a 0\u20130 draw with Arsenal in the fourth round of the FA Cup. The January transfer window saw increased speculation about Ledley's future and Cardiff City turned down two bids from Premier League sides West Ham United, who saw an offer of \u00a35m turned down, and Wigan Athletic, who had a bid of \u00a34m and former Cardiff player and Wales international Jason Koumas rejected.

This uncertainty resulted in Ledley being stripped of the captaincy. Despite the speculation over his future, Ledley remained with Cardiff and played 45 minutes of the first ever competitive match at the Cardiff City Stadium, before being substituted at half-time due to illness. In the third league match of the season, Ledley made his 200th league appearance for Cardiff in a 3\u20131 win over Plymouth Argyle. On 2 September 2009 Ledley was offered a new four-year contract by Cardiff City, which was later rejected. During a 3\u20131 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday on 26 September 2009, Ledley was sent off for the first time in his career after two bookable offences. Following a poor run of results by Cardiff City during November 2009, Ledley was the focus of criticism over his performances, most notably from Cardiff City chairman Peter Ridsdale who commented that, due to his ongoing contract talks, Ledley was \"playing like he is somewhere else already\". However, Ledley received backing from both Cardiff City manager Dave Jones and club captain Mark Hudson, before later stating that he needed surgery on a hip injury that had plagued him for the previous three months and subsequently hindered his performances. On 9 December, Cardiff confirmed that Ledley needed a hip operation before the end of the season. He scored his first goal of the season on 28 December with the opener against Peterborough United, and 17 minutes later he scored again with a header. On 29 January 2010, Ledley underwent surgery on his hip problem which was expected to rule him out for the rest of the season, but made an early return as a substitute during a 2\u20131 win over Swansea City. On 17 April, Ledley scored against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road to ensure Cardiff a 1\u20130 win and also a Championship Play-Off place for that season.

He made his competitive debut for the club on 28 July in a 3\u20130 defeat to Braga in the first leg of the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, before making his SPL debut two weeks later in a 1\u20130 win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Ledley was played in an unfamiliar role at left-back during his first month at Celtic, a position he had only previously played in once or twice. Despite playing in an unfamiliar position, he concentrated on establishing himself in his new team, stating \"...if I am told to do a job for my team, I try to do it to the best of my ability\", and he scored his first goal for Celtic against St Mirren in a 4\u20130 home victory in the SPL on 22 August 2010. By the end of August, the arrival of Honduran left-back Emilio Izaguirre saw Ledley return to his more familiar midfield role.

Four days later Ledley was sent off when he was red carded for a challenge on Hearts midfielder Ian Black during a 0\u20132 defeat at Tynecastle. Ledley publicly defended himself, stating \"I couldn't believe it when the ref sent me off. I thought it was a fair challenge\", and added \"I spoke to Ian [Ian Black] after it and even he told me I got the ball \u2013 there was no way I went in to intentionally hurt anyone.\" Manager Neil Lennon also defended Ledley after the match, describing referee Craig Thomson's decision as \"ridiculous\". He regained his place in the team on his return from suspension and continued to play regularly. After a 3\u20131 win over Dundee United in February 2011, Neil Lennon praised Ledley's performance, stating \"In my opinion, Ledley completely ran the game in the first half \u2013 he was excellent. He was all over the place, winning tackles, making passes and getting up and down the park and it was great to see.\" On 16 March 2011, Ledley scored both Celtic goals in a 2\u20131 Scottish Cup win against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, taking Celtic into the last four. On 20 March 2011, Ledley played in the second cup final of his career, this time the Scottish League Cup Final against Rangers. He scored with a glancing header in the first half to equalise an earlier goal from Rangers, but the Ibrox club eventually ran out 2\u20131 winners after extra time.

Five days later he started in Celtic's 1\u20131 draw with Italian team Udinese. He played at left back but had to come off at half time due to a groin injury. On 21 October, he scored a clever backwards header from a free-kick to give Celtic a 1\u20131 draw against Stade Rennais. He scored Celtic's winning goal in a 1\u20130 victory over Rangers in December 2011, a win which saw Celtic leap-frog their Old Firm rivals to first place in the league, and followed that up with another goal against Hearts in February 2012, before scoring again three days later against Inverness Caledonian Thistle. On 18 March 2012, Ledley played in another Scottish League Cup Final. However, for the second year running he was on the losing side as Celtic lost 1\u20130 to a late goal from Kilmarnock. The season did culminate in silverware for Ledley though, as Celtic won the Scottish Premier League for the first time in three years. The title was clinched on 7 April 2012 as Celtic crushed Kilmarnock 6\u20130 at Rugby Park, with Ledley scoring Celtic's fifth goal. After the match, Ledley described Celtic's title win as being \"...one of the biggest achievements of my life\", also adding that Celtic \"...have been fantastic this season and we proved it again this time against a very good Kilmarnock team. We deserved it as we've played the best football in the SPL.\" In total, Ledley made 32 appearances in the league that season, scoring 7 times."

His manager at Cardiff Lennie Lawrence said that he expected Ledley to be getting a full Wales call-up very shortly. In May, Wales manager John Toshack, when talking about the impact of captain Ryan Giggs retiring, said that he was hopeful for the future because Ledley along with other left-sided youngsters Gareth Bale and Lewin Nyatanga were all very talented players who could play for the national team for years to come. Ledley played at several youth levels for Wales as a youngster, eventually winning his first senior Wales cap in an away World Cup qualifying match against Poland on 7 September 2005. His first international goal came against San Marino in a Euro 2008 qualifier on 17 October 2007. In 2008 Ledley, along with a number of other full Wales internationals, was called back into the Wales U21 squad in a bid to help the team qualify for the U21 championships, only for a back injury to rule him out. On 29 May 2009, with a number of first team players missing from the side, Ledley was named as captain of Wales' youngest ever side for the 1\u20130 win over Estonia and Wales' 2010 World Cup qualifying match a week later against Azerbaijan in Baku. He won his 50th international cap on 16 November 2013 in a friendly against Finland, and was involved in the move which led to Wales' goal in a 1\u20131 draw.

Ledley has been criticised for not being a very quick player, some critics have suggested that several Premier League clubs who were interested in him may have been put off by his lack of pace. However, John Hartson has said that pace is not necessarily the most important thing, especially when Ledley is good in so many other aspects of the game. He has also said that he thinks Ledley would be able to play in the Premier League and compared his style of play to that of players like Xabi Alonso and Frank Lampard. At the start of Ledley's career he was generally played as a left winger. However, since the 2008\u201309 season, he has been used more in the centre."

After he signed, he played for the Geneva Cubs of the Class A-Short Season New York\u2013Penn League and the Quad Cities Cubs of the Class A Midwest League. He began the 1984 season with Quad Cities, and in 1985, he received a promotion to the Winston-Salem Spirits of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. Martinez led the Carolina League with a .342 batting average; the second-place finishers, Keith Miller and John Wilson, batted .302. Martinez began the 1986 season with the Iowa Cubs of the Class AAA American Association. The Cubs promoted Martinez to the major leagues for the first time on June 15, 1986, and he served as an injury replacement for Bob Dernier. He had a .119 batting average (8-for-67) before he was optioned back to the minor leagues in August. Martinez made the Cubs major league roster in 1987, splitting time in center field with Dernier. He batted .292 in 142 games. Martinez struggled in the 1988 season, batting .230 in mid-June. On July 14, 1988, Martinez was traded to the Montreal Expos in exchange for Mitch Webster. He finished 1988 with a .255 batting average and 23 stolen bases. Martinez was pegged as a platoon player in Montreal, as he batted against right-handed pitchers and sat against left-handed pitchers. The Expos also had outfielders Otis Nixon, Marquis Grissom, and Larry Walker on their roster. He played 126 games in 1989, hitting .274. In 1990, Martinez lost the competition for the center field job to Grissom. However, Grissom was injured, and Martinez platooned with Nixon in center field. Martinez batted .279 with 11 home runs in 118 games in 1990. He batted .295 in 1991. After the 1991 season, the Expos traded Martinez with Willie Greene and Scott Ruskin to the Cincinnati Reds for Bill Risley and John Wetteland. He was sought out as a replacement for Eric Davis for the Reds. He competed with Reggie Sanders for the starting job during spring training. Martinez played for Cincinnati in 1992, but as Sanders established himself as the Reds' starting center fielder, Martinez declared for free agency after the season. He signed with the San Francisco Giants on a two-year contract for the 1993 and 1994 seasons.  He suffered a torn hamstring in 1993 and was limited to 91 games. He hit .241, his lowest average in several seasons. The Giants waived Martinez in October 1994 after he was held to a .247 average, four home runs and 27 runs batted in (RBIs). Martinez signed a one-year, $500,000 contract with the Chicago White Sox for the 1995 season. He received limited playing time under manager Gene Lamont. When Lamont was replaced by Terry Bevington, Martinez saw an increase in playing time. He signed a two-year $1.425 million contract for the 1996 and 1997 seasons. He spent the 1996 season as a backup behind Darren Lewis, Tony Phillips, and Danny Tartabull, along with fellow backup Lyle Mouton. In 1997, Martinez batted, .286 and set career highs with 12 home runs and 55 RBIs. He then signed a two-year contract with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays worth $3.5 million with an option for a third season at $1.75 million. In addition his desire to play in Florida, he was enticed by the Rays' additions of Fred McGriff, Wilson \u00c1lvarez, and Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez. In 1998, he recorded the first hit in Tampa history. His contract option for the 2000 season vested when he recorded his 500th at bat of the 1999 season. After batting .260 in his first 29 games of the 2000 season, the Devil Rays, who needed to improve their pitching staff, traded Martinez to the Cubs for Mark Guthrie and cash. On June 9, 2000, the Cubs traded Martinez to the Texas Rangers in a three team trade that sent Chuck Smith from the Florida Marlins to the Rangers and Brant Brown from the Marlins to the Cubs. On August 4, 2000, the Rangers traded Martinez to the Toronto Blue Jays for a player to be named later.  The Blue Jays sent Peter Munro to the Rangers to complete the trade. By playing for four MLB teams in one season, Martinez tied the record. Since 1901, the previous players to play for four MLB teams in a season were Frank Huelsman (1904), Willis Hudlin (1940), Paul Lehner (1951), Wes Covington (1961), Mike Kilkenny (1972), and Dave Kingman (1977). Dan Miceli (2003) and Jos\u00e9 Bautista (2004) later achieved the feat. With Toronto, he filled in for the injured Ra\u00fal Mondes\u00ed as the Blue Jays contended for the American League wild card. Between the four teams, he had a .274 batting average, five home runs, and 47 runs batted in (RBIs) in 132 games. Martinez signed with the Atlanta Braves on a two-year contract covering the 2001 and 2002 seasons, valued at approximately $3\u00a0million. He batted .328 in the first half of the 2001 season, but only .233 in the second half. Late in the year, he was diagnosed with chronic tendinitis in the patella. He appeared in the MLB postseason for the only time in his career, as he played in the 2001 National League Division Series, as the Braves defeated the Houston Astros, and the 2001 National League Championship Series, where the Braves lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Martinez returned to the Braves in 2002, but missed the entire season after he injured his right knee during spring training. He announced his retirement. In 1,919 games played, Martinez had a .276 career batting average, 1,599 hits, 91 home runs, 795 runs scored, and 580 RBIs."

        "content": "McCrimmon began his junior career at the age of 15 with the Prince Albert Raiders of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL). He played two seasons with the team, scoring 23 goals and 84 points. In his second season, 1975\u201376, he was named the SJHL's defenceman of the year. For the 1976\u201377 season, he moved up to the Brandon Wheat Kings of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). He scored 84 points in 72 games in his first WCHL season and added 13 points in 15 playoff games as the Wheat Kings reached the league championship series, only to lose to the New Westminster Bruins.  McCrimmon scored 97 points in 1977\u201378 and 98 in 1978\u201379. He was named the defenceman of the year in 1978 and was named to the league all-star team in both seasons.  He also joined the Canadian junior team at the World Junior Championship in each season.  He recorded two assists in six games to help Canada win a bronze medal at the 1978 tournament and had three points in five games in 1979 though Canada failed to medal. With McCrimmon as team captain, the Wheat Kings again reached the league championship in 1978\u201379. He scored 28 points in 22 games to help Brandon win the President's Cup. The team advanced to the 1979 Memorial Cup tournament where it reached the final against the Ontario Hockey League champion Peterborough Petes. McCrimmon routinely played a high number of minutes each game; his teammates marvelled at his stamina. In the Memorial Cup final, he played virtually every minute of the contest.  His total ice time was 60 minutes, 38 seconds, and he was off the ice only to serve a two-minute penalty.  Peterborough won the game, 2\u20131 in overtime, after McCrimmon lost the puck on a play he thought was icing was not called.  Peterborough's Terry Bovair stole the puck from him and scored the championship winning goal. Despite the loss, McCrimmon was named a tournament all-star on defence."

        "content": "At the 1979 NHL Entry Draft, considered one of the deepest in league history, McCrimmon was selected 15th overall by the Boston Bruins. He made his NHL debut on October 11, 1979, in the team's opening night victory over the Winnipeg Jets. He scored 5 goals and 16 points in his rookie season of 1979\u201380 and improved to 11 goals and 29 points in his second season. With only nine points in the 1981\u201382 season, McCrimmon had gained a reputation as a player who did not attack with the puck in the NHL.  Following the retirement of Rogie Vachon, the Bruins needed a new goaltender.  They sent McCrimmon to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Pete Peeters on June 9, 1982. Flyers' coach Bob McCammon argued that McCrimmon had been \"intimidated\" by playing with fellow 1979 Bruins pick and all-star, Ray Bourque, and that he could be a better overall defenceman. McCrimmon's offence improved in his first two seasons in Philadelphia \u2013 25 points in 1982\u201383 and 24, though without a goal scored, in 1983\u201384 \u2013 but he established himself as a top shutdown defenceman with the Flyers. He recorded 43 points in 1984\u201385 and posted a plus-minus rating of +52, fifth best in the NHL. McCrimmon was ruled out of the 1985 Stanley Cup Playoffs in the third game of the league semi-final against the Quebec Nordiques when he suffered a third-degree separation of his left shoulder following a hard hit by Wilf Paiement, an injury that required surgery to repair. The Flyers reached the final without McCrimmon, but were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers for the Stanley Cup. McCrimmon returned to start the 1985\u201386 season, in which he had his best season statistically.  He appeared in all 80 games for the Flyers and set career highs of 13 goals, 43 assists, 56 points and his plus-minus rating of +83 was second only to defensive partner Mark Howe. He was named recipient of the Barry Ashbee Trophy as the Flyers' top defenceman. McCrimmon and the Flyers became embroiled in a contract dispute prior to the 1986\u201387 season.  The two sides were unable to agree on a contract the season before, and an arbitrator was required to resolve the impasse.  The arbitrator sided with the team, setting a contract at the Flyers' offer of US$165,000 for that season (he asked for $200,000), with an option to extend the deal for 1986\u201387. The Flyers exercised that option, and though he admitted he was under contract for the season, McCrimmon refused to play unless a new deal was reached.  When the two sides were unable to come to an agreement, McCrimmon went home to Saskatchewan as the season began. The Flyers suspended McCrimmon on September 26, 1986, after he refused to appear in the first exhibition games.  The impasse was not resolved until a month later, when he and the team agreed to a one-year contract on October 29.  He immediately returned to the team and appeared in 72 of the Flyers' 80 games, recording 22 points and finishing fourth in the league at +45. In the 1987 Stanley Cup Playoffs, he appeared in all 26 post-season games as the Flyers again reached the final against Edmonton.  McCrimmon scored the game-winning goal in Game 3 but the Flyers lost the series, but not before they took the Oilers to seven games, the first time since 1971 a full seven game series had been played. Following the season, general manager Bobby Clarke refused to sign a new deal with McCrimmon, choosing instead to trade him. He was sent to the Calgary Flames on August 27, 1987, in exchange for a third-round selection at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft and a first-rounder at the 1989 Draft. On the 1987\u201388 Flames, McCrimmon joined Al MacInnis, Paul Reinhart, Gary Suter and Ric Nattress to form one of the top defences in the NHL. He scored 42 points for the Flames, won the NHL Plus-Minus Award with a league-leading +48 and was named a second team All-Star.  Additionally, he played in the 1988 All-Star Game. McCrimmon recorded only 22 points in 1988\u201389 \u2013 his lowest in seven seasons \u2013 but led all NHL defencemen with a +43 rating. He appeared in all 22 playoff games for the Flames as the team defeated the Montreal Canadiens to win the first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history. McCrimmon was named the 10th captain in Flames history on November 3, 1989, succeeding Lanny McDonald and Jim Peplinski, who both retired following the Stanley Cup win. He scored 4 goals and 19 points during the 1989\u201390 season, but fell out of favour with head coach Terry Crisp as the two disagreed over how the team's defencemen were used. The Flames chose to trade him following the season, sending him to the Detroit Red Wings on June 15, 1990, in exchange for a second-round draft pick. In 1991\u201392, McCrimmon was paired with a young Nicklas Lidstr\u00f6m. Though he focused on defence, allowing Lidstr\u00f6m to be more creative offensively, McCrimmon's 29 points were a significant improvement on the 13 he scored the season before. He played one more season in Detroit before again being traded, this time to the Hartford Whalers on June 1, 1993, in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick.  In Hartford, the 34-year-old McCrimmon served as a mentor for 18-year-old Chris Pronger. Offensively, he scored 16 points total in three seasons with the Whalers between 1993 and 1996. Leaving the team as a free agent, McCrimmon signed with the Phoenix Coyotes for the 1996\u201397 season. He appeared in 37 games that season, scoring one goal and adding five assists.  Following the season, he announced his retirement. McCrimmon was paired with some of the best defencemen of his generation.  In addition to Lidstrom and Pronger, he played with Hockey Hall of Famers Ray Bourque, Mark Howe and Paul Coffey. He was known as a stay at home defenceman who focused on limiting the opposition's chances.  He played a physical game, often in the \"dirty\" areas of the ice \u2013 battling opponents in the corners and in front of the net. McCrimmon's career plus-minus was +444, a total surpassed by only nine players as of 2012. Brian Propp, a teammate of his in Philadelphia, said that he was one of the most under-rated defencemen of his time."

        "content": "McCrimmon moved behind the bench shortly after his retirement, joining the New York Islanders as an assistant coach to Mike Milbury on August 19, 1997. He left the team after two years to become head coach of the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League in 1999.  In two seasons with the team, he coached 144 games, winning 50 and tying 15. McCrimmon coached the Blades to a second-place finish in the East Division in 1999\u20132000 and a seven-game opening round playoff victory over the Regina Pats before the team was eliminated by the Calgary Hitmen. Returning to the NHL in 2000, McCrimmon joined the Calgary Flames as an assistant to Don Hay. He remained with the team for two and a half seasons, serving under both Hay and successor Greg Gilbert until the team replaced its coaching staff on December 3, 2002. He returned to the NHL in 2004 as an assistant for the Atlanta Thrashers.  He was promoted to associate coach in his fourth season when team general manager Don Waddell fired head coach Bob Hartley during the 2007\u201308 season. McCrimmon had been offered the Thrashers head coaching position after Waddell's dismissal, but turned it down after the team failed to guarantee he would retain the position beyond the end of the season. Leaving the Thrashers, McCrimmon signed a three-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings in 2008 to serve as an assistant coach. Looking to further his career, he left Detroit on May 19, 2011, and was introduced as head coach of Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on May 29. He hoped that coaching the Russian club would help him land an NHL head coaching position in the future. He never coached a game for Lokomotiv, as on September 7, 2011, he was killed in the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash en route to their first game of the season. McCrimmon died along with nearly the entire team."

He often returned to his hometown during his playing days, spending his summers training on the family farm. He brought the Stanley Cup back to Plenty in 1989 after winning it with the Flames, fulfilling a promise McCrimmon made to his grandfather as a youth. Hockey was a significant part of McCrimmon's life from his youth.  His father Byron was a long time senior player and coach for the Rosetown Red Wings in Saskatchewan. The younger McCrimmon played for teams in both Plenty and Rosetown at the same time, often appearing on teams one level above his age. His younger brother Kelly is the general manager for the Vegas Golden Knights, and the pair played together as teammates with the Wheat Kings in 1978\u201379. Nicknamed both \"Beast\" and \"Sarge,\" McCrimmon was often considered \"gruff\" and had a direct way of speaking that cultivated respect amongst his peers.  According to former teammate Lanny McDonald: \"He was tough, he was abrasive, but on the inside he was a big teddy bear, a big softie.\" McCrimmon's brother remembered him as a person who dedicated himself to his family. McCrimmon had two children with his wife Maureen: daughter Carlin and son Liam."

In the 2005\u201306 season, he was sent to the Flames' new farm team, Omaha Ak-Sar-Ben Knights. After injuries to defencemen Rhett Warrener and Roman Hamrl\u00edk late in 2005, Regehr was called up to the Flames. In his first National Hockey League game on December 29, 2005, he dressed with his brother Robyn and scored an assist on the game-winning goal. After only 3 games the Flames sent him back down to the Ak-Sar-Ben Knights, but on January 7 he was once again recalled. Regehr was recalled by Calgary again on February 2, 2006. Regehr replaced Knights teammate Mark Giordano (who was recalled to the Calgary Flames) at the 2006 Canadian AHL All-Star team. He registered a goal and an assist in the All-Star game. In the 2007\u201308 season, he moved to Germany, joining Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) club Frankfurt Lions. The following year, he signed with fellow DEL side Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin.

He made his first major league appearance on April 22, 2003 against the Expos. Webb wound up finishing the  season with 28 starts and a 10\u20139 record. He was honored with Baseball America Rookie of the Year Award and placed third in the Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award voting in the National League. Webb was made the #2 starter to Randy Johnson in  following the team's offseason trade of  Curt Schilling. He finished the season with a 7\u201316 record in a league high 35 starts, leading the league in losses, walks and wild pitches, and posting an ERA of 3.59. In , he posted a 14\u201312 record and an ERA of 3.54. He led the team in ERA, innings pitched (229) and wild pitches (14). After the season he signed a four-year contract extension worth a guaranteed $19.5 million (that included a team option for 2010). Through his first 13 starts of the  season, Webb had a perfect 8\u20130 record, which included a 30 inning scoreless streak. He suffered his first losing effort of the season on June 10, in a 5\u20130 loss to the New York Mets. An early contender to win the National League Cy Young Award, Webb pitched in the 2006 MLB All-Star Game, recording one hitless inning. Webb struggled in the second half of the season in part due to elbow soreness. He scored a win in an emotional outing versus the San Diego Padres on August 28, pitching seven effective innings. The win came a day after close friend and former UK teammate Jon Hooker and his new bride were among the victims of the doomed Comair Flight 5191 leaving Lexington. Webb went on to finish the 2006 season with a record of 16\u20138 and an earned run average of 3.10, and was recognized with the NL Cy Young Award. His 16 wins tied five other pitchers for the most victories in the National League. Webb's win total marked the lowest for a starting pitcher who won the Cy Young in a full season. His 3.10 ERA was the fourth best in the majors. In  Webb logged an Arizona Diamondbacks franchise record 42 scoreless innings as of the conclusion of his start on August 17, 2007 including three straight shutouts. This is the twelfth longest such streak in major league history, and the sixth longest since 1940, surpassed only by Orel Hershiser (59), Don Drysdale (58), Bob Gibson (47), Sal Maglie (45) and R.A. Dickey (). His three consecutive shutouts during the streak was the longest streak since Roger Clemens accomplished the same with Toronto in 1998. This streak came to an end when the Milwaukee Brewers scored in the first inning of his start on August 22, 2007. Webb carried the D'backs rotation in 2007, leading the team as it won the National League West crown. Webb finished with a record of 18-10 with a 3.01 ERA. Webb pitched the first game of the 2007 playoffs against the Chicago Cubs. Webb pitched 7 innings of 1 run ball, striking out 9 en route to a win. The Diamondbacks went on to sweep the Cubs but fell to the Rockies in the NLCS, Webb falling in the first game. Webb allowed 4 runs in 6 innings, taking the loss. The Diamondbacks were ultimately swept 4-0. Webb began the  season with nine straight wins, becoming the first Major League pitcher to do so since Andy Hawkins won his first ten in 1985. Going into the All-Star break Webb was atop the Majors in wins, standing at 13\u20134 with an ERA of 3.21 and a WHIP of 1.13. He made the All-Star team and threw a scoreless 14th inning with two strikeouts at Yankee Stadium. Webb finished the 2008 season with a career high and NL leading 22 wins, against 7 losses. He finished second in the National League Cy Young voting to division rival Tim Lincecum. His 3.15 ground ball/fly ball ratio was the highest in the major leagues. In , Webb was named #31 on the Sporting News' list of the 50 top current players in baseball. Webb pitched on opening day against the Colorado Rockies, but was limited to just four innings. On April 7, 2009, he was placed on the disabled list with right shoulder bursitis. On August 3, 2009, Dr. Keith Meister of the Rangers performed surgery on his right shoulder, ending his season. Despite the injury, after the 2009 season ended the Diamondbacks picked up Webb's $8.5 million option for 2010. The team would have had to pay a $2 million buyout had it declined. Webb spent the year rehabbing his injury and did not appear at all in 2010."

In June 2000, through a loophole, Van Ryn signed as a free agent with the St. Louis Blues.  NHL teams retain the rights of drafted college players until they leave the school.  Van Ryn challenged this practice in court and an arbitrator ruled that a player drafted off a college team could play one season of major junior hockey and then become a free agent.  Thus after two years at the University of Michigan, Van Ryn went on to play one year for Sarnia Sting, and then became a free agent, which allowed him to sign a three-year deal with St. Louis."

He transferred to UCLA in 1958 and played three seasons.   Kilmer also played on the Bruins basketball team in 1959\u201360 under head coach John Wooden. He capped off his college career with an outstanding senior season in 1960: he threw for over 1,000 yards, ran for over 800, scored eight touchdowns and served as the team's punter.  Kilmer was also awarded the 1960 W.J. Voit Memorial Trophy as the outstanding football player on the Pacific Coast, and finished fifth in voting for the Heisman Trophy. After the conclusion of a UCLA career that saw him finish among the top five in school history for passing and rushing yards, as well as total offense, Kilmer played in the 1961 College All-Star Game, where he earned Most Valuable Player honors.  He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999. There is some lingering controversy over exactly which position he played. His Hall of Fame plaque lists him as a halfback and says he \"played tailback in UCLA's single-wing formation.\"  Other sources list him as a quarterback."

He was also selected in the fifth round of the 1961 AFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers, but signed with San Francisco on December 30, 1960.  During that rookie season in 1961, he saw action as a primarily running quarterback in Red Hickey's shotgun formation, rushing for 509 yards and ten touchdowns, with his top performance coming against the expansion Minnesota Vikings on October 15 when he rushed for four touchdowns. The following year Kilmer was primarily used as a running back but his season came to an early end following a December 5 auto accident in which he fell asleep in his 1957 Chevrolet convertible and drove off the Bayshore Freeway into the San Francisco Bay. Suffering a fractured leg, Kilmer's injury was bad enough to also force him to sit out the entire 1963 NFL season.  He was able to return the following year, but his production was limited. His most memorable play as a 49er came in 1964 during a game against the Vikings at Kezar Stadium. On October 25, 1964 Kilmer fumbled after catching a pass from George Mira. The fumble was recovered by Vikings defensive end Jim Marshall, who infamously ran 66 yards in the wrong direction.  In spite of Marshall's gaffe, the Vikings still beat the 49ers, 27-22. After he saw no action in 1965 and was involved in a training camp contract dispute the next season, Kilmer was placed in the 1967 NFL Expansion Draft."

        "content": "On February 10, 1967, Kilmer was selected in the expansion draft by the New Orleans Saints and, despite originally being thought of as the team's third-best signal caller, became the team's starting quarterback for much of the next four seasons.  He was the starter for the team's first game, a 27-13 loss at home to the Los Angeles Rams. Kilmer lost his starting job in 1967 after the first three games (all losses), and was replaced by former Baltimore Colt quarterback Gary Cuozzo. However, Kilmer regained that job in 1968. His most prolific performance during his four-year stint with the team came in 1969, when he threw for 345 yards and six touchdowns in a 51\u201342 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on November 2. Kilmer's last win as the Saints' starting quarterback came on week 8 of the 1970 season.  Coach Tom Fears had benched Kilmer after three season-opening losses in favor of backup Ed Hargett. However, Fears was fired after week 7 and replaced by J.D. Roberts.  The new coach brought Kilmer back as the starting quarterback.  On November 8, 1970, in a home game versus the Detroit Lions, Kilmer led what proved to be  a game-winning drive, although he could only bring the Saints as far as their own 44 yard line.  With just one play left in the game, and his team down by a 17-16 margin, coach Roberts opted against asking Kilmer to go for a \"Hail Mary\" pass.  Instead, kicker Tom Dempsey, who had earlier in the second half kicked an 8-yard field goal, was asked to attempt a 63-yard field goal.  (The goal posts were still placed on the goal line in 1970, and not on the end line as they are today.)  Dempsey made the kick, which broke the existing record by 7 yards. Only two longer field goals have been kicked since. In a 2016 TV interview, recorded during a celebration of the Saints' 50th anniversary, Kilmer denied lingering rumors that he had been Dempsey's holder.  \"I got out of the holding business a while ago,\" Kilmer recalled, \"but it was Joe Scarpati and it was a perfect hold.\" (Scarpati was a reserve defensive back.) Kilmer added, \"when [Dempsey] kicked that ball, I knew he had made it.  It was like Babe Ruth hitting a 500-foot home run. He really nailed it. And that was at sea level.\" This dramatic victory is still the stuff of legend today.  Dempsey was a big man who had been a lineman in junior college and semi-pro ball, even though he was born with no toes on his right foot, which was his kicking foot. He used a special flat-fronted kicking shoe. This win proved to be the only highlight of an otherwise dismal 2-11-1 season: Kilmer closed out the season by leading the Saints to six consecutive losses. Frustrated after four years of the Saints' futility and sensing New Orleans would draft Ole Miss star Archie Manning with the second overall pick of the 1971 NFL Draft, Kilmer asked to be traded and was granted his wish on January 23, 1971, when he was dealt to the Washington Redskins for linebacker Tom Roussel and two draft selections."

        "content": "The trade which brought Kilmer to the Redskins was the first trade the team made after George Allen replaced Bill Austin (who had been the interim head coach since Vince Lombardi's untimely death in August 1970) as the head coach. Kilmer seemed destined for a reserve role behind future Hall of Famer Sonny Jurgensen. However, this changed when Jurgensen suffered a severe shoulder injury in a pre-season game against the Miami Dolphins. Kilmer got the starting job and kept it for most of the next four seasons, but Jurgensen stayed on as his backup.  The two players were friendly rivals during those years. Fans in Washington tended to be loyal to one quarterback or the other, sporting buttons at games that read \"I like Billy\" or \"I like Sonny.\"   Kilmer did not throw the tight spiral that Jurgensen did, but his wobbly passes often got the job done. Kilmer then led the resurgent Redskins to a 5-0 start in 1971, but then the team ran into a midseason slump. Kilmer briefly lost his starting job as a result of the slide, but regained it after Jurgensen again injured his shoulder.  The next season, Kilmer led the 1972 'Skins to an NFC-best 11\u20133 record, while also leading the NFL in touchdown passes (19) and passer rating (84.8). After the season, Washington advanced to their first Super Bowl, against the hitherto unbeaten Miami Dolphins. Washington's tough defense held the vaunted Dolphins to just two touchdowns, but Miami's defense was even tougher.  The Redskins didn't get on the board late until the 4th quarter, after a bizarre special-teams blunder by the otherwise impeccable Dolphins. Miami kicker Garo Yepremian's field goal attempt with a little over 2 minutes to go in the game was blocked, and Yepremian himself recovered the ball, which would have been OK if he had not then inexplicably tried to pass the ball, with no success whatsoever. Redskins' defensive back Mike Bass recovered Yepremian's fumble and ran the ball back 49 yards for a touchdown. Kilmer got the ball with 1:14 to go in the 4th quarter, on his own 30, with his team down 14-7. Kilmer had the chance to send the game into overtime, but he was unable to move the ball. The game ended with a 9-yard sack. Miami lineman Vern Den Herder grabbed Kilmer's face mask on that final play and ripped his helmet off, but no penalty was called. The Dolphins became the first and still only unbeaten NFL team of the Super Bowl era. The loss didn't dampen Kilmer's individual recognition as he was named to the Pro Bowl and the All-NFC Team. In 1974, the Redskins acquired a third quarterback, a Notre Dame alumnus named Joe Theismann who had been a star in the Canadian Football League for three seasons. Kilmer beat out both Jurgensen and Theismann for the starting job. Jurgensen retired at the end of the 1974 season. Kilmer remained with the Redskins until he retired after the 1978 season. 1978 was also the season when Theismann finally took over Kilmer's starting quarterback position, although Kilmer did start two games that season, going 1-1-0. During his time with the Redskins, Kilmer became one of the few remaining users of a single-bar face mask on the helmet, as multi-bar face masks became the norm in the NFL.  Theismann also wore the single-bar throughout his career.  Kilmer finished his 18-year NFL career with 1,585 completions in 2,984 attempts for 20,495 yards and 154 touchdowns, with 146 interceptions.  He also rushed for 1,509 yards and 21 touchdowns, caught 27 passes for 288 yards and one touchdown, and punted the ball 16 times for 598 yards."

Kilmer's most memorable night on the town came early Monday morning December 6, 1971 after beating the Giants 23\u20137. He got arrested at the Toddle House, a coffee shop in Arlington, Virginia. Apparently, Kilmer and unidentified female friend attempted to pay a $4 tab with a $100 bill and an argument ensued with their waitress. A local police officer named Edmund D. Sheroshick showed up, and Kilmer, told the policeman, \u201cIf you think I\u2019m wrong, put me in jail!\u201d Officer Sheroshick did exactly that, but Kilmer was released in plenty of time for his next team practice. In the next few days, Kilmer won the hearts of fans by leading the Redskins to a 38-24 victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Monday Night Football which clinched a playoff berth, and also by telling the waitress she could keep the $100 as a tip.  Ironically, Officer Sheroshick was disciplined after getting into an altercation of his own on early Christmas Eve morning at the exact same Toddle House.  Even though he was off-duty and was not drunk, the officer had violated his department's rules by driving his cruiser while drinking. On December 11, 1976, Kilmer was arrested for drunk driving less than two days before a game against the Dallas Cowboys.  He was released in time to lead the Redskins to a 27-13 victory on Sunday, December 12, on the road at Texas Stadium."

He signed for Celtic in a \u00a317,500 deal on 31 October 1971 but was unable to play for Celtic immediately as he was, at the time, serving a six-match ban; during this period he spent his free time working in the Paisley office of the Evening Times. He played for Celtic until 1976, and during this time he scored 125 goals in 186 games, and set several scoring records. The six goals he struck in a defeat of Partick Thistle in the 1973-74 season is a post-war record for a single game; Thistle's goalkeeper was the Scotland goalkeeper Alan Rough. He is the only player in Scottish football history to twice score a hat trick in a major cup final, achieving the feat in the 1972 Scottish Cup Final and the 1974 Scottish League Cup Final, both against Hibernian. He is also remembered for the part he played in the semi-final of the 1971\u201372 European Cup, when Celtic were paired with Inter Milan, whom they had beaten in the final five years earlier. The two legs and extra-time failed to yield a single goal and so the tie proceeded to penalties. Deans, who had come on as a substitute, took the first kick for Celtic and missed. Inter then scored all five of their penalties and moved on to the final against Ajax. Deans earned two caps for Scotland, both in 1974. He was left out of the Scotland squad for the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany. He had made the initial 40 man squad, but missed the final cut of 22, as Donald Ford and Denis Law were selected instead. Deans was eventually capped in October 1974, in a 3\u20130 win against East Germany, and a month later won a second cap in a 2\u20131 defeat against Spain. In 1976, Deans was transferred to Luton Town in a \u00a320,000 deal. He spent a month on loan to Carlisle United in 1977 and played briefly with League of Ireland side Shelbourne (5 league games, no goals) before moving to Australia to play for Adelaide City. He is still a hero to the Adelaide fans for his goal-scoring abilities when he was the leading scorer in Australia in 1977/78. With the club he also won the Australian Cup of 1979, defeating St. George in the final 3\u20132. He returned to Scotland with Partick Thistle in 1980, where he retired."

In response, on 2 January 2008, Albelda's lawyer claimed that Valencia had ignored his client's plea for an amicable end to the player's contract, with legal recourse the only possible avenue left. With news of this hitting the media, several teams, although he would not be able to join any Spanish team for the remainder of the season, having played more than four league games, studied the possibility of signing him in the winter transfer window, with hopes of a free transfer. In late April 2008, however, with Koeman's dismissal, all three were reinstated by new manager Voro in a squad seriously threatened with relegation, with five remaining rounds. He returned to action in the second half of the 6\u20130 away loss against FC Barcelona on 4 May, and received his first post-reinstatement start in a 5\u20131 victory in the derby away at Levante UD the following week, as the side mathematically retained top-flight status. For 2008\u201309, Albelda remained a regular fixture alongside longtime central midfield teammate Rub\u00e9n Baraja. On 10 January 2009 he delivered an outstanding performance at right back, replacing suspended Miguel in a 3\u20133 home derby against Villarreal. Albelda was played intermittently by Valencia from 2010 to 2013, also suffering several injury problems. On 10 June 2013, it was announced that the 35-year-old would not renew his contract with the club, leaving as a free agent; he announced his retirement two months later. On 29 May 2019, Albelda was appointed manager of Tercera Divisi\u00f3n side Atzeneta UE. He led them to their first-ever promotion to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B on 26 July 2020, after beating CD Alcoyano in the play-offs. On 24 May 2021, after being immediately relegated, Albelda left the club."

He scored his first goal for the club in a 2\u20130 victory over Crewe on 4 November 2003 only to suffer serious injury a few weeks later.

After a brief spell at Blackpool to improve his match fitness earlier in the season, Armstrong became a valuable member of the team that gained promotion back to the Premiership in 2005\u201306. He was rewarded with the fan's Player of the Month award for March, the Capital One Young Player of the Year and, in July 2006, a new three-year contract. Armstrong was a regular starter over the next two seasons but was often asked to fill in across the field, playing both in the centre and out wide in midfield and defence. He succumbed to several injuries which kept him sidelined through this period and missed much of the second half of the 2007\u20132008 season due to a groin injury. Following his return to fitness he found himself unable to break back into the starting eleven under new manager Kevin Blackwell."

Baseball America named him the Carolina League's #1 prospect, and the Pirates #2 prospect. Baseball America after 2002: \u201cBurnett was anointed as the Hillcats' ace--and he rarely disappointed. A left-hander with a 91 mph fastball and the league's best changeup, he did his part to help create a winning attitude on the field. Batters found it difficult to drive the ball in the air against him because he pitches down in the strike zone.\u201d  His velocity improved in 2002, hitting .  His changeup is his best pitch, he also has a good slider. Knowles: \u201cHe needs to improve his breaking ball, he makes a lot of mistakes with it, but he throws enough strikes with his other pitches that he gets by with it.\u201d After sporting a 14\u20136 record with the Double-A Altoona Curve in 2003, Burnett advanced to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds for 2004.  He was recalled by the Pirates, and made his major league debut on May 30, 2004, against the Chicago Cubs.  Burnett pitched five solid innings, allowing only one run, but did not get a decision in the game. He finished the 2004 season with a 5\u20135 record and a 5.02 ERA. Burnett missed the entire 2005 campaign with shoulder and elbow problems which eventually culminated in surgery. He spent the 2006 and 2007 seasons with the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. After a stellar 2008 spring training, Burnett was returned to Triple-A, as the Pirates decided to keep Rule 5 pitcher Evan Meek in his place. Meek was designated for assignment on May 4, 2008, and Burnett was recalled to take his place.  Burnett made his first major league appearance since August 21, 2004 on May 6, 2008 against the San Francisco Giants.  He allowed 2 runs in  of an inning.  Said Burnett of his return: \"Honestly, it might have been more nerve-racking than my debut because my debut came so easy.  It was such an easy road coming up through the Minor Leagues. This one was so much more hard work, and harder to get here, and a lot more time.\" Burnett had a 4.54 earned run average (ERA) in  innings pitched for the Pirates from 2004-2009."

Johnson quickly established himself in the heart of the Derby defence, playing 39 games and scoring once as Derby narrowly avoided relegation from the First Division. The 2004\u201305 season (the first as the Championship, the new name for the old First Division), was a great success for Derby, as they finished 4th and qualified for the play-offs, though injuries to key players I\u00f1igo Idiakez and Grzegorz Rasiak meant they lost in the play-off semi-final to Preston. The 2005\u201306 season saw Johnson named as captain, a role he held until 2006 when he was named club captain. It was a disappointing for Derby as a pre-season change of manager and the sale of several key players meant that the club finished 20th, with Johnson playing 31 games and scoring once. The 2006\u201307 season began well for Derby. After being top of the table for most of the season, the team slipped away towards the end of the season, finishing third and qualifying for the play-offs. After beating Southampton 3\u20132 on aggregate in the semi-finals, Derby beat West Bromwich Albion 1\u20130 in the final. Despite missing the end of the season (including all three play-off games) through injury, Johnson made 29 league appearances, scoring once. The 2007\u201308 season saw Johnson, now 34 years old, relegated to fifth-choice centre back. Consequently, in September 2007, Johnson joined Sheffield Wednesday on an emergency one-month loan deal. He made his debut on 22 September and made an impact as Wednesday picked up their first points of the season (which was 9 games old) in a 1\u20130 win against Hull City at Hillsborough. His loan was extended for a third and final month in November 2007, with Johnson playing 13 league games for Wednesday before returning to Derby at the end of December 2007. On 26 December 2007, Johnson returned to the Derby team to face Liverpool, coming on as a first-half substitute. His return was greeted by Derby fans with cheers and chants of \"There's only one Michael Johnson\". Johnson made 2 further league appearances and came on as a substitute in the cup against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough, where he was greeted by a hero's welcome from the Wednesday fans. He then left to re-join the team where he started his career, Notts County, on loan for the remainder of the season."

As an NHL head coach, Schoenfeld has compiled a record of 256\u2013246\u201378 (.509). In 2007, he was promoted from the head coach of the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League to assistant general manager of the New York Rangers, the Wolf Pack's NHL affiliate. At the time, he was also assigned to be the general manager of the Wolf Pack until he was relieved of those duties in 2017. Schoenfeld is remembered for an altercation with NHL referee Don Koharski after game 3 of the 1988 Wales Conference Finals after his New Jersey Devils lost 6\u20131 to the Boston Bruins. During the argument Koharski fell down and accused Schoenfeld of pushing him. As people yelled at Schoenfeld, at least one saying \"you're done\", believing that he'd pushed Koharski, Schoenfeld continued arguing with Koharski who said he hoped that the entire exchange was on videotape. Schoenfeld yelled back, \"Good, 'cause you fell, you fat pig! Have another doughnut! Have another doughnut!\" as Koharski and the other officials headed to their dressing room. Schoenfeld was suspended by League disciplinarian Brian O'Neill for the following game, but the Devils sought a court order to overturn the suspension. About 40 minutes before the start of the game, New Jersey Superior Court Judge James F. Madden issued a restraining order allowing Schoenfeld to coach, subsequently triggering a walkout by the scheduled game 4 officials: referee Dave Newell and linesmen Gord Broseker and Ray Scapinello. After more than an hour's delay, three local off-ice officials \u2013 Paul McInnis, Jim Sullivan and Vin Godleski \u2013 were tracked down to work the game. The Devils went on to win the game by a score of 3\u20131, but Schoenfeld was later suspended for game 5, fined $1,000, and his team $10,000, and the officials returned to work. This incident was parodied later in the movie Wayne's World, when a rather large and apathetic police officer named Officer Koharski hung out at the counter of Stan Mikita's Doughnut Shop. The movie used Stan Mikita's as the name of a doughnut shop, as a parody reference to the chain Tim Hortons. Coincidentally, during the final part of his career, Tim Horton himself teamed on defense with a young Jim Schoenfeld with the Buffalo Sabres. Later, Schoenfeld often paired with Jerry Korab. On July 23, 2007, Schoenfeld was named New York Rangers assistant general manager to Glen Sather, replacing Don Maloney (who had become general manager of the Phoenix Coyotes franchise). Ken Gernander took over the head coach position in Hartford, while Schoenfeld retained his position of general manager for the farm team. On April 26, 2009, while serving as interim assistant coach for the Rangers under head coach John Tortorella, Schoenfeld stepped in to act as head coach for game 6 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals against the Washington Capitals following Tortorella's one-game suspension for inappropriate fan contact in game 5 of the series. He stepped down from his positions of senior vice president and assistant general manager on May 16, 2019."

While the Fighters, Carp, Chunichi Dragons, Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, and Orix BlueWave all considered selecting Darvish with their first-round pick in the final months, the Fighters were one of the few teams that chose not to forgo the first round in exchange for signing a college or industrial league player prior to the draft.

In particular, he went 10\u20130 after 30 May, playing a leading role in the Fighters' first Pacific League title since  (his win streak lasted until 14 April of the following season, when it reached 12\u20130) and contributing to their first championship since  in the Japan Series over the Dragons. Darvish was chosen to take the hill for the first game of each of the Pacific League playoffs, Japan Series, and the 2006 Asia Series (played between the champions of Japan, China, Taiwan, and South Korea at the end of the season). Darvish, then 20 years old, became the first pitcher to start a Japan Series game since 1987 while under the age of 21, and the fifth pitcher in NPB history to win a Japan Series game at that age with his win in Game 5 of the series. He also won the Asia Series Most Valuable Player award."

        "content": "Darvish was named the Fighters' starter for their  season opener, becoming the fourth pitcher in franchise history (including the Fighters' years as the Senators and Flyers) to start a season opener within three years of graduating high school (the other three pitchers all started season openers as rookies). He struck out 14 over nine innings in a no-decision in his second start against the Lions on 30 March (the game ended a 2\u20132 tie in extra innings) and 14 again in a complete game win in his next start against the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks on 7 April, becoming the second pitcher in Japanese professional baseball history to strike out 14 or more batters in two consecutive starts. Darvish went on to post a 15\u20135 record with a 1.82 ERA (falling just 0.003 points short of the league lead, which went to Chiba Lotte Marines left-hander Yoshihisa Naruse) for the year, limiting hitters to a .174 batting average against and leading the league with 210 strikeouts. He led the Fighters to their second consecutive league title, winning both of his starts in the second round of the Climax Series (playoffs) against the Marines. Darvish took the mound in Game 1 of the Japan Series that followed on 27 October against the Dragons for the second straight year, pitching a 13-strikeout, complete game win in an intense pitchers' duel with then-Dragons ace Kenshin Kawakami and becoming the third pitcher in Japan Series history to strike out 13 or more batters in a single game. With the Fighters down 3\u20131 and facing elimination, Darvish started Game 5 on 1 November and held the Dragons to one run over seven innings while striking out 11. However, the Fighters had no answer for opposing right-hander Daisuke Yamai and closer Hitoki Iwase, failing to get a single man on base and allowing the first perfect game in Japan Series history. (However, the game was not an official perfect game according to NPB regulations, which state that a perfect game must be thrown by a single pitcher.) The Dragons won the game 1\u20130, charging Darvish with the loss and becoming Japan Series champions. The 24 strikeouts that Darvish totaled in his two starts were the second-highest by any single pitcher in series history (and the highest in a series that went only five games). Darvish was presented with both his first career Eiji Sawamura Award (being the first to meet or exceed guidelines for the award in all seven categories in 14 years) and his first Most Valuable Player award following the season. He also won the Golden Glove and Best Nine awards that year. Darvish made his national team debut in the 2007 Asian Baseball Championship (which also functioned as the Asian qualifying tournament for the 2008 Beijing Olympics) against Chinese Taipei on 3 December 2007. Because Japanese law requires that a person holding dual citizenship choose a single nationality before their twenty-second birthday, Darvish had chosen to retain his Japanese citizenship so that he could play for the national team in the Olympics. On 22 December, Darvish re-signed with the Nippon Ham Fighters for 200 million yen plus payment at piece rates, up 128 million yen from 2006. At 21 years old, Darvish became the youngest player in Japanese baseball history to reach the 200 million yen mark."

Even as his team struggled in the opening months of the season, Darvish continued to rack up wins at a pace that exceeded his own in the previous season. As the year went on, he and Eagles ace Hisashi Iwakuma emerged as the league leaders in both wins and ERA. On 10 April, in their only match-up of the season, neither gave up a single hit through the first five innings. Iwakuma went the distance, throwing just 100 pitches and giving up just one run on three hits; yet Darvish topped this, throwing another complete game shutout on three hits and just 95 pitches in one of the best pitchers' duels of the season. While he did not pitch the way he had hoped in the Olympics, Darvish promptly put up a perfect 5\u20130 record with a 1.29 ERA and two complete games in the five starts upon returning to the Fighters, leading them to a playoff berth in a heated race against the Marines. While the Fighters failed to make the Japan Series, Darvish took the mound in two playoff games, giving up one run in a complete game win in one and pitching a complete game shutout in another. Although he lost out to Iwakuma (who put up an astonishing 21\u20134 record) in wins, he finished second in all three Triple Crown categories, finishing the season with a 16\u20134 record, 1.88 ERA and 208 strikeouts. (It was his second straight year putting up an ERA under 2.00, throwing more than 200 innings, and striking out over 200 hitters despite missing time due to the Olympics.) Regardless, the Sawamura Award was presented to Iwakuma, and Darvish became just the second pitcher to clear the guidelines in all seven categories to not win the award (Suguru Egawa was the first in 1982). Darvish took the mound in Game 1 of the first round of the Climax Series against the Orix Buffaloes on 11 October, allowing nine hits but holding the team to one run while striking out 14 in a 4\u20131 complete game win. He started Game 2 of the second round against the Saitama Seibu Lions on 18 October and pitched a complete game shutout in a 5\u20130 win, but the Fighters lost the series 4\u20132 and fell short of their third straight appearance in the Japan Series. On 1 December, Darvish re-signed with the Nippon Ham Fighters for 270 million yen plus payment at piece rates, up 70 million yen from 2007."

Darvish gave up three runs in the first inning but went the distance, allowing no runs from the second inning onward in a 121-pitch, complete game loss (Iwakuma held the Fighters to one run over six innings and was credited with the win). On 24 April, he struck out six straight and 11 overall en route to a four-hit, complete game shutout (his first of the season) over the Buffaloes, following it up by holding the Lions to one run and striking out 11 over nine innings in a no-decision in a match-up with fellow 22-year-old ace Hideaki Wakui on 1 May (the Fighters lost 2\u20131 in extra innings). On 22 August, Darvish was taken off the active roster for the first time in his career due to injury. The Fighters classified it as \"shoulder fatigue\", and the deactivation came after a career-worst start against the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, in which he went eight innings, but gave up six earned runs in a losing effort. He was reactivated on 13 September, but in his second start back a week later against the Orix Buffaloes, Darvish gave up a career-high seven walks in five innings, and two runs. Three days later he was deactivated again due to discomfort in his shoulder and a sore back. Darvish was activated again just in time for the 2009 Japan Series against the Central League champion Yomiuri Giants, and he pitched Game 2 on 1 November. He went six innings, giving up two runs on seven hits, and also striking out 7 Giants. He became the winning pitcher, and the team won 4\u20132. The Yomiuri Giants would go on and win the championship series 4 games to 1. After the Japan Series, It was revealed that Yu had a stress fracture of the right-hand forefinger. Darvish said he first experienced pain after practice on 28 October but kept it to himself. Also, he was unable to fully use the lower part of his body due to hip pains. Darvish was presented his second Most Valuable Player and Best Nine awards at the end of the season. He became the third player to have won 2 MVP awards in their first five years in the NPB, joining Kazuhisa Inao and Ichiro Suzuki. However, he lost out on his second Sawamura Award to Saitama Seibu Lions ace Hideaki Wakui. On 9 December, Darvish re-signed with the Nippon Ham Fighters for 330 million yen, up 60 million yen from 2009. At 23, Darvish became the youngest player in Japanese baseball history to reach the 300 million yen mark, along with being the highest-paid pitcher in the Pacific League presently."

The Fighters finished 74\u201367, but in fourth place. His opening day loss was reflective of his 2010 season; he pitched well but the team struggled. He began the 2010 season losing to the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks on 20 March. Darvish allowed two early unearned runs on his way to a complete game loss (5 runs allowed, 3 earned runs) striking out 13. The Fighters began the season with a 5\u201314\u20131 stretch that was put them with their worst winning percentage in five years. They struggled in all phases of play, but Darvish continued to pitch well. Even at this low point, he was leading the league in strikeouts even as the rest of the rotation was 3\u20139. Darvish struck out at least 10 hitters in each of his first five starts. Darvish's 2010 season also was noticeable because speculation increased about his potential move (or posting) to Major League Baseball. Darvish was interviewed by The Associated Press where he announced his plans to review his options at the end of the season. He noted, \"Right now, I'm just focused on helping my team win this season ... Once the season is over, I'll consider my future.\" The Associated Press noted that both his exposure to international play during the 2009 World Baseball Classic and recurring injuries both led him to consider leaving Japan. In addition to back problems he also missed a start in June with a sore right knee. Despite the injuries and potential distractions, Darvish pitched well down the stretch. His last three starts were all complete games and he struck out 35 hitters in those 27 innings. Darvish finished the season with only a 12\u20138 record, but with a 1.78 ERA. He led the league with 10 complete games, 222 strikeouts, a 1.01 WHIP. This was Darvish's fourth consecutive sub 2.00 ERA. On 18 October 2010, Darvish posted on his blog that he would be returning to the Fighters for the 2011 season."

        "content": "On 6 January 2011, Darvish agreed to a contract for the 2011 season that would make him the highest-paid player in Japan. His salary was 500 million Japanese Yen (which on 6 January converted to $6,065,490 US dollars). The 2011 Nippon Professional Baseball season was delayed by the Tohoku earthquake. Controversy emerged over when baseball should resume. Commissioner Ryozo Kato was criticized for comparing the resumption to the return of Major League Baseball ten days after the September 11 attacks. Darvish was among the players who felt that it was not appropriate to quickly return to baseball, saying, \"I am a baseball player and a human being as well. I cannot think about baseball alone as I normally do.\" Darvish took part in efforts to raise funds for the relief efforts and personally donated 50,000,000 Yen (about US$620,000) to the Japanese Red Cross. Eventually, the teams agreed to play the full 144-game schedule, but the start of the season would be pushed back several weeks. The season began on 12 April 2011 and Darvish started against the Saitama Seibu Lions. He struggled, allowing seven runs in seven innings and taking the loss. This poor start would not reflect on his overall performance. After that opening game, he would not allow more than three runs in any of his starts. Darvish would win his next eight starts and thirteen of his next fourteen decisions. Darvish would finish with his strongest all-around season, winning 18 games and featuring a career-low 1.44 ERA. He also led the league with 28 starts, 232 innings, 276 strikeouts and a 0.82 WHIP. He also featured remarkable control, walking only 36 batters. Despite his accomplishments, Darvish was not recognized with the best pitcher in Japan honor, the Sawamura Award. Three of the five-member committee voted to recognize Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles right-hander Masahiro Tanaka. Selection committee chief Masayuki Dobashi explained, \"ERA is the best stat to evaluate pitchers ... Tanaka's ERA was a little better than that of Darvish. Tanaka also had more complete games than Darvish.\" Pitchers must qualify for the award by meeting seven criteria: 15 wins, a 2.50 ERA, 200 innings pitched, 10 complete games, 150 strikeouts, 25 appearances and a .600 winning percentage. Both Tanaka and Darvish met all the criteria. Tanaka noted, \"I only had better numbers than him (Darvish) ... As a pitcher, I'm nowhere near his caliber.\" The Nippon Ham Fighters were eliminated in the first round of the Pacific League playoffs, losing both games to the Saitama Seibu Lions. Darvish started game one of the series, going seven innings and allowing only one run on four hits, while striking out nine. After Darvish departed, Seibu scored one run in the 9th inning to send the game to extra innings and added three more to win the game in the 11th inning. After being eliminated, speculation again increased about Darvish being posted to Major League Baseball. His pending divorce allegedly complicated this situation. Speculation centered on his wife's potential claims to a share of a new contract with an American team."

He added confirmation of this posting on his blog. MLB teams had until 14 December 2011 to submit a blind posting bid, and the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters had until 20 December 2011 to announce whether the highest bid would be accepted or rejected. Their announcement of acceptance of the highest bid, from the Texas Rangers, was made on 19 December 2011 EST, at a reported $51.7 million. The Rangers then had 30 days to negotiate with Darvish, or he would return to Japan. On 18 January 2012, the Texas Rangers signed Darvish to a $60M dollar contract for six years with a player option to void the last year, fifteen minutes prior to a 4:00pm CST deadline. Rangers CEO Nolan Ryan commented that Darvish had shown more control than he did at Darvish's age. Darvish's first start in the Majors came on 9 April against the Seattle Mariners in Texas. His first MLB strikeout was of Dustin Ackley on a 2\u20132 80\u00a0mph curveball; the first MLB hit that he allowed was a single into left field by Ichiro Suzuki on a 2\u20132 96\u00a0mph fastball. He threw for 5 innings, giving up 8 hits, 5 runs, and 4 walks, and striking out five, gaining his first MLB win in the process. When Alexi Ogando came to relieve him in the 6th, Darvish got a standing ovation from the crowd at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. Darvish's first start away from Rangers Ballpark in Arlington came on 14 April against the Minnesota Twins at Target Field. He pitched for 5 innings, allowing 9 hits, 4 walks, and 2 runs (one of which was unearned), while collecting 4 strikeouts. Despite the Rangers winning the game, it was a no-decision for Darvish. Instead, teammate Robbie Ross picked up the win. On 24 April, in a game against the New York Yankees, Darvish pitched for 8 shutout innings, collecting 10 strikeouts, while allowing seven hits and two walks. He gave up a hit to Nick Swisher with one out in the 9th. Joe Nathan, the Rangers' closer, relieved him and induced a ground-ball double play to get the save and secure the third win for Darvish. As Nathan came in, Darvish received a deafening ovation from the crowd. This game also marked the seventh time in MLB history that the two starting pitchers were both Japanese, with Hiroki Kuroda on the mound for the Yankees. The game was also televised in Japan. On 30 April, Darvish gave up his first MLB home run to Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n of the Toronto Blue Jays, in a game that Texas won 4\u20131. Darvish improved to 4\u20130, striking out nine and giving up only one run. For his performances in April, Darvish was named the AL Rookie of the Month. Darvish went 4\u20130 with a 2.18 ERA and 33 strikeouts. His first loss didn't come until 6 May, against the Cleveland Indians. On 20 June, in an interleague game against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park, Darvish got his first career MLB hit. In his first at-bat, he hit a bat-shattering single into shallow right field. He did not get to run the bases however, as Ian Kinsler hit a line shot to the second baseman, and Darvish was tagged off of the bag to complete the double play. He went 1-for-3 for the game. On 5 July 2012, the MLB announced that Yu Darvish for the American League and David Freese for the National League were the final two players to make the 2012 MLB All-Star Game rosters. Darvish had 10 wins and five losses with a 3.59 ERA when the MLB announced him as an All-Star. However, Darvish didn't get a chance to pitch in the game, watching from the dugout as his team lost 8\u20130."

The Rangers won the game 3\u20130 as Darvish pitched seven shutout innings and struck out six overall. On 9 May, Darvish took a no-hitter in the seventh inning against the Boston Red Sox before giving up a single to David Ortiz. The hit was initially ruled an error, thus allowing Darvish to take a no-hitter into the ninth before Ortiz recorded a single in that inning, however Major League Baseball subsequently overruled the scoring decision, ending the no-hitter in the seventh. On 11 June 2014 Darvish threw his first complete game shutout against the Miami Marlins. Darvish allowed 6 hits, 3 walks and struck out 10.

He lost both games, including game seven, and allowed nine runs (eight earned) in 3 innings while failing to strike out a single batter. They were the shortest two starts of his career, and Darvish became the first starting pitcher since Art Ditmar in 1960 to have two starts of less than two innings in the World Series. Shortly after the World Series, an unnamed Astros player suggested that Darvish had been tipping his pitches. Dodgers teammate Chase Utley had evaluated Darvish's game three start and concluded that this was not the case, though Darvish changed his approach for game seven. More than a month later, a Sports Illustrated article revealed that the Astros had figured out how Darvish was tipping his pitches: \"Darvish holds the ball at his side when he gets the sign from the catcher. Whether he re-grips or not as he brings the ball into his glove was the tip-off whether he was going to throw a slider/cutter or a fastball.\" This unnamed Astros player said the Astros had known about this going into Game 3 which they also won, but that they had an even better game plan for Game 7. After the season, Darvish became a free agent for the first time in his career, and he chose not to re-sign with the Dodgers as there was much fan ire against him for his disappointing World Series outings that many felt had cost the Dodgers the title. With the Astros being disciplined on 13 January 2020 for using cameras to steal catcher-to-pitcher signals during the 2017 MLB postseaon, Darvish refused to blame sign stealing for his poor starts and instead suggested that the 2017 Astros batters were talented, and humorously joking on Twitter that he would wear a \"Yu Garbage\" jersey if the Dodgers held a championship parade."

The subpar outing caused Hoshino to lose faith in him and scratch Darvish from the semi-finals that he had penciled him in for, sending Darvish to the mound only in situations that would have no bearing on Japan's fate in the tournament. Darvish started the last game of the preliminary round against the United States on 20 August and was brought in to mop up after the U.S. had taken a decisive lead in the bronze medal match, finishing the tournament 0\u20131 with a 5.14 ERA (albeit with 10 strikeouts in seven innings pitched)."

        "content": "Darvish pitched in the 2009 World Baseball Classic as the de facto ace of the Japanese national team, starting the opening game against China on 5 March. He pitched four innings, allowing one walk and no hits and striking out three as Japan beat China, 4\u20130. However, pitching in a Major League stadium for the first time in his career, he struggled in his second outing of the tournament against South Korea on 17 March, throwing five innings and giving up three runs (two earned) on four hits and a walk and ultimately being charged with the loss. His first career save would follow six days later, when he pitched the final inning of the semi-finals against the United States, yielding no runs and a single and striking out two as Japan won 9\u20134. Darvish came on in relief in the bottom of the ninth inning of the championship game against South Korea with Japan leading 3\u20132. He struck out his first batter, walked the next two, struck out his next, and then gave up a tying two-out single before finishing the inning with another strikeout. However, Japan scored two runs in the top of the tenth inning to regain a 5\u20133 lead, and after giving up a leadoff walk in the bottom of the inning, Darvish retired the next three batters (striking out two of them) to clinch Japan's second consecutive tournament title. In the WBC he finished at 2\u20131 with a 2.08 ERA and 20 strikeouts in 13 innings. He recorded a career-high 99\u00a0mph when he worked in relief at the WBC."

        "title": "Yu Darvish_Pitching style",
        "content": "Darvish is a right-handed pitcher who throws from a three-quarter arm slot in a drop-and-drive motion. He has a large frame for a pitcher, listed at 6\u00a0ft 5 in and 220\u00a0lb. Darvish throws a four-seam fastball which averages 93\u201395\u00a0mph (tops out at 99\u00a0mph), as well as a hard slurve (slider) in the low 80s with a sharp break. He complements these two with a wide repertoire of secondary pitches, including a two-seam fastball (also described as a shuuto), a cutter, two curveballs, a splitter, and an occasional changeup. Darvish has a \"fast curve\" and a \"slow curve\", the former averaging about 80\u00a0mph and the latter about 71. The slow curve is almost exclusively used in no-strike and 1-strike counts, while the fast curve is mostly used in 2-strike counts. Some professional scouts consider Darvish to have the best repertoire of quality pitches, including the best slider, in all of Major League Baseball. In August 2019, Darvish learned a knuckle curve from Cubs teammate Craig Kimbrel and began using the pitch. Advance scouting on Darvish is made difficult by his tendency to change his most frequent pitch sequences over time. While Darvish uses both the set, or \"stretch\" position and the windup, he has been noted for pitching exclusively from the stretch at times, even when there is no one on base. While pitching from the windup is generally thought to add velocity to pitches, the set position allows pitchers more control over baserunners. In Darvish's case the set position often is used as a way of keeping his delivery in sync and consistent. Prior to the 2006 season Darvish's \"go-to\" pitch was a screwball, and he tends to rely more on his off-speed pitches than his fastball. After injuring his shoulder in an exhibition game start against the 2006 World Baseball Classic Japanese national team in February 2006, because of the strain the screwball had gradually been putting on his shoulder, he took the pitch out of his in-game repertoire and worked to develop his splitter until it became an equally effective pitch that would replace the screwball. He also has succeeded in increasing his fastball velocity from year to year. In 2019 season alone, he used 10 different pitches: Cutter with two different movements, four seam and two seam fastballs, slider, splitter, normal and slow curveballs, knuckle curve and a changeup. In 2020, he revealed on Twitter that he learnt a 'supreme pitch', which is a hybrid between a splitter and two-seam fastball. This pitch can reach 93 mph. Yu Darvish also has a few ways to learn new pitches to add to his deep pitching arsenal. One of his favorites was to use it in game without knowing, which forces him to adapt quickly."

Darvish established a humanitarian fund dedicated to the construction, installation, and maintenance of wells, well pumps, and rainwater storage facilities in developing countries called the \"Yu Darvish Water Fund\" in February 2007. He announced plans to contribute to the fund by donating 100,000 yen each time he notches a regular season win. The fund is managed by the Japan Water Forum. An entertainment company, Avex Group Holdings Inc. manages Darvish's non-baseball rights worldwide and Darvish has appeared in ads for many companies, including Seiko, Asahi Dry Black Beer and Pocari Sweat. Also, Darvish has appeared on the covers of Japanese men's fashion magazines, such as GQ, Men's Non-No, and Gainer. Darvish was selected as the \"GQ Man of the Year\" in the February 2012 Japan issue. On 30 July 2015, Darvish announced that his girlfriend, former world-champion wrestler Seiko Yamamoto, gave birth to their son on 29 July. Darvish resides in a $4.55 million home in Evanston, Illinois. Darvish has caused controversy in his neighborhood with requests to construct a six-foot high fence around the property and to acquire adjacent land owned by the City of Evanston. The six-foot fence would require a zoning variance and would obstruct the lake views of neighbors. Darvish built a six-foot solid wood fence, and Darvish's neighbors filed a lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court on 29 March 2019, asking a judge to rule that the Darvishes' fence obstructed their view of Lake Michigan, violating an easement and a verbal agreement."

        "content": "Adam Parrish Wainwright (born August 30, 1981), nicknamed \"Waino\" and \"Uncle Charlie\", is an American professional baseball pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). The Atlanta Braves selected him 29th overall in the first round of the 2000 amateur draft from Glynn Academy in Brunswick, Georgia. Wainwright's performance in the minor leagues brought him notice as one of the Braves' top pitching prospects. The Braves traded him to the Cardinals after the 2003 season, receiving outfielder J. D. Drew. Wainwright made his MLB debut on September 11, 2005, against the New York Mets. After spending his first full MLB season as a relief pitcher, Wainwright briefly assumed closer duties, saving the series-clinching games of both the 2006 National League Championship Series and World Series. The next season, he returned to starting pitching, a role in which he has since remained, except for 2011, which he missed due to Tommy John surgery. Wainwright emerged as an ace as he led the National League multiple times in wins, innings pitched, and games started. He also has multiple top-ten finishes in earned run average, strikeouts, walks plus hits per inning pitched, and complete games. In 2014, Wainwright became the first pitcher in Major League history to post nine of his first 18 starts with seven innings pitched and no runs allowed. In his career, Wainwright has won more than 150 games, three All-Star selections, two Rawlings Gold Glove Awards, and finished in the top three in the Cy Young Award balloting four times. With 2,004 career strikeouts through the 2021 season, Wainwright is second to Bob Gibson (3,117) in Cardinals franchise history in strikeouts."

Wainwright chose to forgo college to go straight to the pros, signing a contract that included a $1.25 million bonus. The Braves had been his favorite team growing up. Less than two weeks after high school graduation, Wainwright reported to the Braves rookie team and soon advanced to Atlanta's Class A Danville Braves in the Appalachian League. He pitched for the Macon Braves in the South Atlantic League in 2001, where he broke the team record for strikeouts, previously held by Bruce Chen, with 184. Wainwright spent the 2002 season in the Carolina League and also participated in that season's All-Star Futures Game. In 2003, Wainwright advanced to the Braves' Double-A club, Greenville. He was Baseball America's top Braves prospect in 2003. In December of that year, the St. Louis Cardinals acquired Wainwright with pitchers Jason Marquis and Ray King in a trade that sent outfielder J. D.

On May 24, 2006, he hit a home run on the first pitch he saw as batter in the major leagues against the San Francisco Giants' Noah Lowry; he became the 22nd batter, and only the seventh pitcher, in Major League history and 11th National Leaguer to hit a home run off the first pitch thrown in his first at-bat. Wainwright pitched capably as a middle reliever, but when incumbent closer Jason Isringhausen underwent season-ending hip surgery in September, Wainwright was pressed into service as the closer. He saved two crucial games on September 27 and 30 as St. Louis held off the Houston Astros' late charge and won the NL Central Division championship. Despite their unexceptional 83\u201378 regular-season record, the Cardinals rolled through October to win the 10th world championship in franchise history. As the closer, Wainwright closed out the final game of the Cardinals' National League Division Series, ending the New York Mets' season and propelling the Cardinals to the 2006 National League Championship Series, where he famously struck out Carlos Beltr\u00e1n in Game 7 to send the Cardinals to the World Series. In Game 5 of the 2006 World Series, Wainwright struck out Detroit Tigers third baseman Brandon Inge to win the world championship."

Statistically, the 2012 season proved to be an overall disappointment by Wainwright's standards, as he wound up 14\u201313 with a 3.94 ERA. However, it was encouraging in regards to the health of his right arm, as he completed the entire season without any issues. In addition, pitchers recovering from TJS often find it challenging at first to throw with the same command as before the surgery, and thus to achieve post-surgery results equal to pre-surgery results. This was the case at first with Wainwright. On May 22, he threw his first complete-game shutout since August 6, 2010, and the third of his career in his ninth complete game. It was a four-hit, 4\u20130 win at home against the San Diego Padres, striking out nine and walking only one. Wainwright reached his 1,000th career inning on July 29. The May 22 start marked a turning point in the season. During a 13-start stretch through August 3, he pitched  innings, striking out 83 while allowing just four home runs and 17 BB. Wainwright attributed the improvement to be able to sustain the usual finishing movement on his pitches through late innings, which earlier in the season, had eluded him, thus making his pitches easier to hit. He also corrected a subtle flaw that had developed on the grip of his curveball during a bullpen session prior to the start against San Diego. The flaw made it increasingly difficult to throw the curveball for consistent strikes."

At the time, he was under the last year of his previous contract, so the new deal extended him through 2018. With a total value of $97.5 million, it was the largest contract ever for a Cardinals pitcher. On April 18, he became the first pitcher in baseball since 1900 to achieve 28 strikeouts and zero walks in his first four starts of a season. Slim Sallee established the franchise record exactly 100 years earlier by not issuing a walk in his first 40 innings. Wainwright's streak ended in a start at Washington on April 23 after  innings and 133 batters faced. The first MLB pitcher to post 10 wins on June 13, Wainwright put up seven scoreless innings in a 2\u20131 defeat of the Mets at Citi Field. Moreover, his strikeout of David Wright was his first of the game and the 1,000th of his career. He allowed six hits and struck out a total of four. Wainwright became the NL Pitcher of the Month for June with a 4\u20132 record and 1.77 ERA. With 40 strikeouts for the month, Wainwright issued just six walks while holding opposing batters to a .220 average. Through that point in the season, he was 11\u20135 with a 2.22 ERA, and was the MLB leader with four complete games and a 9.5 strikeout-to-walk ratio. In successive starts against the Reds in late August, Wainwright allowed 15 runs, both losses. He struck out eight in seven shutout innings on September 7 at home in a 5\u20130 win over the first-place Pirates in earning his 16th victory of the season. The Pirates, Reds, and Cardinals were all close contenders for the Central division title in September. The win gave the Cardinals first place over the Pirates by a half-game, and  games over the Reds. Wainwright's seven strikeouts increased his career total to 1,103, passing Dizzy Dean (1,095) for second place among Cardinals' pitchers. Only Bob Gibson (3,117 in 528 games) had more. In a 60-inning stretch following the All-Star break Wainwright had walked 14, compared with 15 in  IP before the break. When fellow starter Shelby Miller defeated Nationals' starter Jordan Zimmerman on September 26, he denied Zimmerman his 20th victory. Two days later, Wainwright, who was second in the league with 18 entering the game, defeated the Chicago Cubs in his final start of the season to tie Zimmerman for the lead in wins at 19. Wainwright also became just the third pitcher in franchise history to twice lead the league in wins, joining Dizzy Dean (1934\u201335) and Mort Cooper (1942\u201343). He also led the NL in games started (34), innings pitched (), hits allowed (223), and batters faced (956), and was third in strikeouts. The Cardinals faced the Boston Red Sox in the World Series, and called upon Wainwright to start Game 1 against Jon Lester. It was Wainwright's first World Series appearance since 2006 and first start. He allowed five runs and St. Louis lost, 8\u20131. In Game 5, a rematch against Lester, the Cardinals again lost, this time 3\u20131. Wainwright struck out 10 in seven innings, becoming the first Cardinal to reach double digits in strikeouts in a World Series game since Gibson against the Detroit Tigers in 1968. After the Cardinals took a 2\u20131 Series lead, the Red Sox won the final three games to take the title. Wainwright won his second Gold Glove award in 2013.

In seven innings, he struck out nine and gave up just three singles in a 1\u20130 win. At Nationals Park against Washington on April 17, he pitched a two-hit shutout, winning 8\u20130. Wainwright gave up the first hit in the second inning on a high infield chopper, but none after until two outs into the ninth. He walked three and struck out eight. It was his seventh career shutout. In an April 27 start against the Pirates, Wainwright tallied eight scoreless innings to extend a streak to 25 innings as the Cardinals won, 7\u20130, but was pulled before he could get a complete game due to concerns over his April 22 hyperextended right knee injury. His streak of 25 scoreless innings ended in the first inning on May 2 in a loss against the Cubs, to whom he allowed six runs. Arguably the finest game of Wainwright's career was his 195th start, on May 20, a one-hitter against the Diamondbacks. He retired the first 11 batters before giving up a double to Paul Goldschmidt in the fourth inning. After the hit, Wainwright retired the final 16 batters, facing only 28, one over the minimum for a perfect game. He walked none and struck out nine, throwing 115 pitches, 86 for strikes. It was Wainwright's seventh win of the year, tying for the National League lead, and his 106th career victory against 59 losses. It also tied him for eighth place with Sallee on the all-time Cardinals' pitching win list and was his eighth career shutout. Wainwright followed that effort with eight more scoreless innings on May 25. Between those two starts, he gave up just one walk and struck out a major-league-leading 21 batters in 17 scoreless innings. He was named NL Co-Player of the Week with Dodgers starter Josh Beckett, who threw a no-hitter on May 25. However, he missed his June 16 against the Mets due to elbow tendinitis, but an MRI showed no structural damage to the Tommy John surgically-repaired ligament. After leading the NL with a 1.79 ERA and 11 wins through July 6, Wainwright was selected to his third All-Star Game at Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was selected as the NL's starting pitcher for the first time in his career. Besides two starts in which he gave up seven runs to the Giants and six to the Cubs, Wainwright had allowed 13 runs in 16 of his first 18 starts. Nine of those starts included totals with seven or more innings pitched and zero earned runs allowed. Per the Elias Sports Bureau (ESB), it was the first time in Major League history that any pitcher achieved that feat in his first 18 starts of the season. When the Cardinals defeated the Brewers 10\u20132 on July 12, Wainwright finished his pre-All Star break total with a 12\u20134 record and a 1.83 ERA. Further, he joined Hall of Fame member Steve Carlton as the only Cardinals to post an ERA less than 2.00 and at least 12 wins before the All-Star break (1969). In that game, Wainwright posted his Major League-leading 15th start of the season with at least seven innings pitched and two or fewer runs allowed. At the plate, his RBI-single scored rookie Oscar Taveras for his 100th career hit. In the All-Star Game, Wainwright incurred controversy over his remarks about facing leadoff hitter Derek Jeter. Jeter, who was retiring after the season, doubled on Wainwright's second pitch of the game. During interviews, he admitted that he gave Jeter an easy pitch to hit. \"I was gonna give him a couple of pipe shots. He deserved it,\" Wainwright said. \"I didn\u2019t know he was gonna hit a double or I might have changed my mind.\" Wainwright later recanted, stating that it was in humor and that he was \"not intentionally giving up hits out there\". Conversely, Jeter was appreciative. \"He grooved them? The first one was a little cutter that he threw down and away. He probably assumed I was swinging. So he didn't groove the first one. The second was about 90, a two-seamer that stayed on a really good ... No, I don't know, man,\" he paused and smiled, drawing laughs from reporters. \"I have no idea. If he grooved it, thank you. You still got to hit it.\" Following the All-Star break, Wainwright temporarily struggled to keep the consistency of the first half of the season due to frequent elbow irritation. In June, he gave up just four earned runs in 31 IP for a 1.16 ERA, and followed that up with a 1.62 ERA in July. His results reversed in August when he allowed 22 ER in  IP for a 5.17 ERA. However, in September, he posted a 1.38 ERA in 39 IP with 29 SO and a 5\u20130 W\u2013L. He was subsequently named the NL Pitcher of the Month for September. After the season, Wainwright had a procedure to remove part of the cartilage of the right elbow on October 24. At times\u2014commencing in June\u2014he had altered his mechanics to mitigate the discomfort. In his third-to-last and second-to-last starts of the season\u2014which were in the NLDS against the Dodgers and NLCS against the Giants\u2014Wainwright was unable to complete five innings in both starts. This led to speculation Wainwright was pitching with pain, which he denied. Through the 2014 season he had a career 132 ERA+, third-highest for an active pitcher who has a minimum of 1,000 innings, and a  winning percentage, fourth-highest for active pitchers. Wainwright finished third in the Cy Young voting for 2014, his third such placing, and fourth time he was positioned in the top three."

On April 25, Wainwright left the game against the Brewers in the top of the fifth after suffering an ankle injury while batting. The next day, the Cardinals placed him on the 15-day disabled list, and announced the following day that he had an Achilles tendon rupture and would likely miss the remainder of the season.

With a recovery initially expected to take nine to twelve months, Wainwright had made four appearances through that point in the season, going 2\u20131 with a 1.44 ERA. As the season progressed, he consistently stated his goal was to return to pitching before the end of the season. After working diligently to accelerate his recovery, the Cardinals announced on September 21 that he was cleared to resume baseball activities, two weeks prior to the conclusion of the regular season. His actual recovery took five months. Making his first appearance of the season since April, Wainwright pitched a scoreless inning of relief in the first game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh on September 30, an 8\u20132 loss.

On the same day, Wainwright became the only active major league pitcher with multiple seasons of 10+ RBI (2016\u201317). The Cardinals placed Wainwright on the 10-day DL on July 25 due to mid-back tightness, retroactive to July 23. It was the fourth time in his career that he had been placed on the DL. Wainwright was activated from the DL on August 6, and totaled 11 innings in three starts. On August 18, the Cardinals placed him back on the DL for right elbow impingement. Wainwright reported pain in his right elbow for the second consecutive season and displayed a precipitous decline in velocity in his most recent starts. Treatments on the right elbow that Wainwright received during the season included trimming cartilage and an injection of platelet-rich plasma into the joint. In 23 games he had started, he allowed a 5.12 ERA with a 12\u22125 W\u2212L record. Wainwright returned to pitch on September 18 from the bullpen for the remainder of the season.

Wainwright led all pitchers with seven runs scored and 11 RBI, and, among all with at least 40 plate appearances, in slugging percentage and OPS. He also hit .462 with runners in scoring position. After the season, Wainwright underwent right elbow surgery to remove a cartilage flap, the first surgery on the elbow since having Tommy John surgery in 2011. The cartilage flap was believed to have caused a bone bruise which led to reduced velocity and efficacy of his breaking pitches. Recovery time was expected to take six weeks with full readiness in time for the 2018 season."

He was signed by the Predators on 23 August 2005, and began his North American playing career with the Predators' top minor league affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL). Initially, Rinne was slated to be the backup for Brian Finley, but Rinne became the starter as a consequence of Finley's poor play. In the summer of 2006, Rinne was \"roughed up by a couple of unknown assailants\" and during the fight, he dislocated his shoulder. As a result, he had to have surgery and missed the first four months of the season. Rinne appeared in two NHL games with Nashville during the 2005\u201306 season. He compiled a record of 1\u20131\u20130 with a .900 save percentage and a goals against average (GAA) of 3.80. Following Dan Ellis's stellar performance for Nashville in the 2007\u201308 season, starter Chris Mason was traded to the St. Louis Blues and Rinne was called up to serve as backup to Ellis for the subsequent 2008\u201309 season. On 1 December 2008, Rinne became only the second Predators rookie goaltender ever to record a shutout. In February 2009, Rinne recorded 9 wins in 12 games and had a .944 save percentage and a 1.72 GAA. He was selected as the NHL Rookie of the Month for his performances. On 14 March, Rinne set a Predators franchise record with his seventh shutout of the season. Rinne was one of two goaltenders to play for Finland in the 2009 IIHF World Championship of hockey, the other being Karri R\u00e4m\u00f6. Rinne started the tournament with a shutout in his first game for the Finns, saving 30 shots. In the 2010\u201311 season opener, Rinne allowed a goal before colliding with Anaheim Ducks forward Troy Bodie and suffering a lower-body injury on the play. Anders Lindb\u00e4ck relieved him and went on to start three games before Rinne returned, only to go down to injury again in December. Upon returning on 23 December, Rinne remained healthy and put up some of the best numbers of his career, including a 1.71 GAA and .946 save percentage in January. At the conclusion of the season came many accolades; Rinne was named one of the three finalists for the Vezina Trophy, conferred to the NHL's top goaltender as judged by the NHL's general managers. He also finished fourth in Hart Memorial Trophy voting, as the NHL's most valuable player, and was named an NHL Second Team All-Star. Rinne led the Predators to their first ever Stanley Cup playoff series win in franchise history in 2011, prevailing over the Anaheim Ducks via a 4\u20132 series win. After shutting-out the Ducks on 29 October 2011, Rinne set the mark for the Predators franchise record for shutouts, with 22. On Rinne's 29th birthday, 3 November 2011, he signed a seven-year $49\u00a0million contract, the largest contract in Nashville Predators team history (since surpassed by teammate Shea Weber and his 13-year, $114\u00a0million contract). That night, Rinne posted a 35-save shutout on the road against the Phoenix Coyotes. During the 2011\u201312 season, Rinne set a franchise record with 11 consecutive wins, passing Tom\u00e1\u0161 Vokoun's previous mark of eight. Rinne had another excellent year in 2011\u201312, leading the NHL in wins, shots against, saves and games played. On 25 April 2012, Rinne was again named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy for the second consecutive year. He also helped the Predators get past the Detroit Red Wings in the 2012 playoffs to win the series 4\u20131. However, Rinne and the Predators were unable to advance any further, falling to Phoenix in five games in the next round. On 25 September 2012, Rinne joined Belarusian club Dinamo Minsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) due to the impending 2012\u201313 NHL lockout. However, he left Dinamo in December and returned to the Predators at the end of the lockout in January 2013 to begin the shortened, 48-game 2012\u201313 season. In May 2013, Rinne had a hip arthroscopy. The hip then became infected on 24 October 2013, leaving Rinne off the ice and undergoing rigorous rehabilitation for the remainder of 2013. He returned to action on 5 March 2014 against the Pittsburgh Penguins, allowing three goals in a 3\u20131 loss. Rinne was a nominee for the 2015 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which eventually went to veteran player Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr. Rinne was also a Vezina Trophy finalist in 2015, marking his third career nomination for the award; he lost to the Montreal Canadiens' Carey Price. On 14 March 2015, Rinne became the fastest goaltender, in terms of games played, to record 30 wins in 39 games since the NHL adopted the shootout, and just the third goaltender in the NHL's expansion era to record 30 wins in 39 games or less. On 16 March 2017, Rinne became the 67th goaltender to play at least 500 NHL games. On 22 May 2017, Rinne backstopped the Predators to the 2017 Stanley Cup Final by defeating the Anaheim Ducks four games to two. https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/predators-advance-stanley-cup-final-win-ducks/ The Predators lost the Stanley Cup Final against the Pittsburgh Penguins four games to two. https://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/nhl/predators/2017/06/12/predators-season-ends-game-6-loss-stanley-cup-final/387449001/ On 24 November 2017, the Predators defeated the St. Louis Blues 2\u20130; the shutout was the 45th of Rinne's career, making him the NHL's all-time leader amongst Finnish-born goaltenders. On 22 February 2018, Rinne became the 34th goaltender to record 300 career NHL wins following a 7\u20131 victory over the San Jose Sharks. When he recorded his 300th win, he had the third-highest win percentage of all goaltenders with at least 300 wins, at 54.34%, behind only Martin Brodeur and Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury. On 17 April, Rinne was again named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy, which he won on 20 June. On 3 November 2018, Rinne signed a two-year, $10\u00a0million contract extension with Nashville. That night, as was the case in 2011, Rinne posted a 26-save shutout over the visiting Boston Bruins in Nashville. On 9 January 2020, Rinne became the 12th goaltender in NHL history and the second goaltender in Predators history to score a goal, doing so against the Chicago Blackhawks by shooting the puck into the empty net from behind his team's goal line with less than 22 seconds left in the game. On 10 May 2021, in the final game of the 2020\u201321 season, Rinne posted a 30-save shutout in a 5\u20130 win over the Carolina Hurricanes. It was his 369th career win, tying him for 19th all-time with Tom Barrasso. It was also his 60th career shutout, passing Evgeni Nabokov for 19th all-time on that list as well. On 13 July 2021, Rinne announced his retirement from professional hockey. The Predators also announced that Rinne's number 35 jersey would be retired on 24 February 2022, making him the first player in team history to receive the honor."

A highly regarded prospect at the time, he was the second goaltender selected in the draft, after Rick DiPietro, who was selected first overall. He subsequently spent time in the American Hockey League with the San Antonio Rampage, Lowell Lock Monsters, Omaha Ak-Sar-Ben Knights, and the Quad City Flames. A recurring knee injury seriously hampered his development at the professional level, and Krahn is now widely regarded as a draft bust. Following the 2007-2008 NHL season and after 8 years of development in the Flames organization, the team made the decision to not re-sign Krahn, and he became an unrestricted free agent. He was signed by the Dallas Stars on September 24, 2008.  Beginning the season with the AHL's Chicago Wolves, Krahn was recalled by the Stars in February 2009, and made his NHL debut on February 14 in relief of starter Marty Turco against the Chicago Blackhawks. Krahn played for the Texas Stars of the AHL from 2009 until 2011. After the 2010-2011 regular season it was announced that he had been left off the Stars' Clear-Day roster and was therefore ineligible for the AHL playoffs. He currently works at Pembina Pipelines."

        "content": "White's frail appearance had been the cause of considerable concern resulting in a number of English First Division clubs choosing not to risk his signing. However, following reviews received from Mackay and now also Blanchflower, Bill Nicholson signed White for Tottenham Hotspur in the same October as White's international goal against Northern Ireland. Nicholson had also sought reference from the Army and been advised White was a celebrated cross-country runner. White cost \u00a322,000. At Spurs, White initially occupied the inside-left position, having been bought by Nicholson to replace Dave Dunmore, but his talent flourished as an inside right as a replacement to Tommy Harmer. He scored on his debut in October 1959, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. White's worth to the team could be calculated in terms of goals scored (between 1959 and the conclusion of the Double winning season (a season in which he was ever-present) he contributed 18 goals) but his success mainly lay in a combination of skills: his passing, his ball control which helped sustain the attacking momentum but so too his runs to find space off the ball, arriving unexpectedly in the opposition's penalty area which resulted in the White Hart Lane faithful giving him the nickname \"The Ghost\". Spurs lost against Benfica in the 1961\u201362 European Cup semi-final, however in the following season White was part of the successful campaign that saw Tottenham become the first English winners of a European trophy when they won the 1963 European Cup Winners' Cup Final. They beat Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 5\u20131 in Rotterdam with White scoring Spurs' second. They had beaten White's Scottish former opponents, Rangers, home and away in the first round. Cliff Jones, his Tottenham teammate, said of him: \"He was a great talent. People ask me what he was like. I say that he was like Glenn Hoddle. But he was different to Glenn in some ways. Glenn was someone who you had to bring into a game, whereas John White would bring himself into a game. If you're not in possession, get in position, that was John White. He was always available if you needed to pass to someone\"."

        "content": "After initially being projected as a second round pick, Williams slipped to the 4th round and was the 111th selection in the draft, where he was picked by the Baltimore Ravens. After a strong training camp and an impressive pre-season, Williams became the slot receiver for the Ravens. During the 2006 season, Williams caught 22 balls for 396 yards (18.0 avg) and 2 touchdowns.  His highlight came in Week 14 against the Cleveland Browns where he caught a 77-yard pass for a touchdown from Kyle Boller that sealed the game and the win for the Ravens. He also was a huge part of the (at the time) franchise record comeback win over the Tennessee Titans, where he caught 4 passes for 75 yards to help the Ravens overcome a 26-17 deficit and win the game 27-26. He finished the season with the (at that time) franchise best 18 yards per catch average for a Ravens rookie. Coming into the 2007 season, he was expected to take a huge leap forward as the Ravens \"deep threat\" receiver, and looked to fulfill that promise with 18 receptions for 267 yards, before being eventually derailed by injury and put on IR after Week 9. He attempted to make a comeback in the 2008 season, once again looking to become the Ravens' big play-maker and stretch the field. After shaking off a little rust, he began to heat up near mid-season with a few big catches, including a 70 touchdown reception against the Oakland Raiders in Week 7. However, he was also unable to continue after that play, with pain from bone spurs in his leg that eventually put him on IR for the season, once again, after surgery. The Ravens didn't draft any big receivers in the 2009 off-season, with general manager Ozzie Newsome stating that they had faith in the receivers they had, and that they were sticking with Williams as their field stretching player. Unfortunately, the injury bug would pop up yet again, this time with only a minor injury during the pre-season, but it was enough to keep him out a game, and give other players time to shine. Though he returned would return, and in the final game of the pre-season posted 4 catches for 77 yards, once again showing his downfield ability, the Ravens ultimately chose to go with Kelley Washington #3 receiver. Due to offensive coordinator Cam Cameron typically only using three receiver sets, this meant that Demetrius saw little to no playing time for over half the 2009 season. Washington went down with injury in a Week 13 matchup with the Detroit Lions, and Williams stepped in and made 2 catches for 45 yds. in a 48-3 rout. The following week, he again showed his promise as a playmaker, with 4 catches for 71 yards and a touchdown against the Chicago Bears. He remained active for the rest of the season, but Washington returned in the following weeks, retaking his #3 spot. Many fans openly wondered at the logic of not playing a speedy receiver like Williams, when the 2009 Ravens ranked near the bottom of the league in yards per catch, and yards after catch. Though he remained with the team and worked hard in the 2010 Ravens off-season programs, he was ultimately cut in August 2010 after the Ravens had signed Dont\u00e9 Stallworth. Ironically, the Ravens had signed Stallworth to take Williams' former role as deep threat receiver, yet he himself would be inactive for much of the season with an injury. Williams finished his Ravens career with a total of 63 receptions, 1,008 yards, and four touchdowns on a 16.0 yard receiving average."

On Sports Illustrated'''s website, a photo gallery chronicling the best possible candidates in the 2008 draft he was tipped as the number one pick. McFadden was also predicted to be a front-runner for many awards, including the Doak Walker, the Maxwell, and the Walter Camp Player of the Year. McFadden began the 2007 season with five consecutive games in which he gained at least 120 yards. Highlighting these were a 195-yard effort against Alabama, a 151-yard game against Troy, and a 173-yard effort against Kentucky. After this stretch of games, McFadden looked to be a lock for the Heisman trophy, at the top of generally every watch list. On November 3, 2007, McFadden tied the Southeastern Conference single-game rushing record held by former Vanderbilt Commodores running back Frank Mordica's 1978 game total versus the Air Force Falcons with 321 yards rushing against the South Carolina Gamecocks.

McFadden ended his college career as the most decorated player in school history, and holds virtually all of the university's rushing records, and is also in a number of the SEC's all-time top 10 rushing spots. His career total of 4,590 yards ranks second all-time in career rushing yards in the SEC, behind only Herschel Walker of Georgia with 5,259. McFadden finished his career in seventh place for the Southeastern Conference career rushing touchdowns record with 41. McFadden is generally considered to be the best and finest football player in Arkansas Razorbacks football history, and is certainly the most decorated. In late December 2007, sports agent and former Arkansas track and field athlete Mike Conley, Sr. was accused by KARK-TV in Little Rock, Arkansas of purchasing a Cadillac Escalade for McFadden, which would have jeopardized McFadden's status as an amateur athlete for the 2008 Cotton Bowl Classic and a possible senior season. KARK later retracted the report and apologized to Conley. On March 6, 2008, Electronic Arts announced that McFadden would be cover athlete for the Xbox 360's version of NCAA Football 09."

        "content": "McFadden was drafted by the Oakland Raiders with the fourth overall pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. The Raiders signed McFadden to a six-year, $60.1 million contract which included US$26 million in guarantees. Contract negotiations were rapid due to Raider fears of a second consecutive contract holdout as was the case with quarterback JaMarcus Russell in 2007. At training camp, McFadden impressed Raiders coach Lane Kiffin with his ability to take instructions once and seamlessly incorporate them into his game. Media observers considered him the most complete Raiders rookie at this stage since Marcus Allen. On September 8, McFadden made his NFL debut against the Denver Broncos, where he had 46 rushing yards on 9 carries; the Raiders lost the game, 14-41. McFadden scored his first professional touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs on September 14, 2008, his second NFL game, in which he gained 164 yards on 21 carries. McFadden also suffered an injury to his big toe in this game, which limited him for the next 14 games, including three missed games. On November 23, in a game against the Broncos, McFadden scored 2 touchdowns, his first multi-touchdown game in his career. He ended the season with 499 yards on 113 attempts, with four touchdowns. He also made 29 receptions for 285 yards. Raiders interim head coach Tom Cable, who took over after Kiffin was fired by owner Al Davis, was criticized for not playing McFadden later in the season. Responding to criticism, Cable stated \u201cWell what really dictated was the rotation we were in, terms of the game, the flow of the game. I think [Justin] Fargas played pretty well. It\u2019s just those situations present themselves.\" Oakland Tribune'' writer Jerry McDonald responded to Cable's statement, saying \"If the flow of the game means keeping McFadden, an excellent receiving back, off the field on third down plays which call for a pass, then the flow needs to be changed by the play-caller.\" During the 2009 Oakland Raiders campaign, McFadden was bothered by numerous injuries and saw a career low in carries and yardage. McFadden's low point of the season came when he rushed for minus 2 yards against the Texans on October 4."

After playing off the bench in a backup role in the first five games of the season, McFadden took over the lead back role in Week 7 against the New York Giants, replacing an injured Joseph Randle and totaling a season-high 152 yards rushing and a touchdown in a road loss. It was his first 100-yard game since 2013 and the first for a Cowboys running back in 2015. He would remain as the starter and finished with 1,089 rushing yards (4th in the NFL), after only gaining 129 yards in his first 5 games. For the second time in his career, he was able to play in all 16 games, while posting 1,417 scrimmage yards (4th among running backs), 4.6 yards-per-carry (3rd in the NFL among the 27 running backs with at least 160 carries), 5 100-yard rushing games (2nd in the NFL), 52 rushing first downs (4th in the NFL), 9 20-plus-yard runs (4th in the NFL), and 2 40-plus-yard runs (4th in the NFL).

The surprising recovery of running back Lance Dunbar from a serious knee injury, made the Cowboys decide to keep McFadden there to start the 2016 season. The success of the team and Elliott, also delayed his activation to the regular season roster until December 13. He passed Morris on the depth chart as the backup running back, as soon as he incorporated into his role against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, because he was seen as more of a complete player with his blocking and receiving skills. In the season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles, he was named the starter to save Elliott for the playoffs. He finished the season after appearing in three games (one start), with 87 rushing yards and 17 receiving yards."

He would make his Major League Baseball debut with the Dodgers on April 19, 1956. On April 15, 1958, Cimoli became the first Major League batter to step into the batter's box on the West Coast when the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants played their first game of the season at Seals Stadium in San Francisco. After the season, the Dodgers traded Cimoli to the St. Louis Cardinals for Wally Moon and Phil Paine. After the 1959 season, the Cardinals traded Cimoli to the Pittsburgh Pirates with Tom Cheney in exchange for Ron Kline. Cimoli played on the Pirates' 1960 championship team, which defeated the New York Yankees in seven games. He was primarily the Pirates' fourth outfielder in 1960 and often platooned with center fielder Bill Virdon. After left fielder Bob Skinner injured his thumb in Game 1 of the World Series, Cimoli started Games 2\u20136 in left field. Cimoli returned to the bench in Game 7 when Skinner returned. In the eighth inning, with the Pirates trailing 7\u20134, Cimoli, pinch-hitting for pitcher Roy Face, led off with a single off Bobby Shantz, advanced to second on Virdon's bad-hop grounder, which struck Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the throat, then scored on Dick Groat's single, the first run in a five-run inning to give the Pirates a 9\u20137 lead. The Pirates gave the lead away in the ninth before finally winning the game in the bottom half on Bill Mazeroski's lead-off home run. On June 15, 1961, the Pirates traded Cimoli to the Milwaukee Braves for Johnny Logan. The Kansas City Athletics selected Cimoli from the Braves in the Rule 5 draft after the season. The Athletics released Cimoli on May 29, 1964, and he signed with the Baltimore Orioles that day. Released by the Orioles before the 1965 season, Cimoli signed with the California Angels on April 10, 1965. He appeared in his final major league game on May 7, and was released on May 14. Cimoli's baseball card in 1958 (No. 286, Topps) in which the background was painted out, shows him swinging a bat, without the bat \u2014 which was also painted out.

To counteract this, he evolved tactically in the following 2018/19 season and began to exhibit traits more associated with inside forwards than traditional wingers. Consequently, the rates at which he completed dribbles, created chances and scored goals increased. He was offered a new contract by Plymouth Argyle at the end of the 2018\u201319 season.

Bell, who was born and raised in Bakersfield, California, played college football at the University of Arizona and was selected in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Steelers.  He was with the Steelers from 1976\u201380, earning Super Bowl rings in 1979 and 1980. He missed the 1977 season because of an injury. He is the Steelers' second-leading career punt returner, behind Rod Woodson. Bell spent his first three years as a reserve, rising to a starting role in 1980 due to injuries to both Lynn Swann and John Stallworth. His 25.8 yards-per-catch average led the AFC that year. He then held out of training camp the next year, hoping to get a salary increase based on his performance. He was instead waived, and was claimed by the Buccaneers, where he replaced Mike Shumann on the roster. He started 13 of 70 games he appeared in for the Bucs and had 95 catches for 1,470 yards and four TDs. During Bell's second season with the Steelers, his first wife, Kathy, appeared on Card Sharks and won several games for a total of $23,000 in prize money. He died in Tampa, Florida at age 52 after suffering from scleroderma and kidney disease. Scleroderma is a chronic disease that causes skin thickening and tightening and can cause damage to internal organs. He was survived by two children, Teleah Bell and Terran Bell (Kiana Bell)."

An All-American at Columbia University, he was the 1942 recipient of the Maxwell Award for College Player of the Year and the first runner-up for the Heisman Trophy.  At quarterback, he passed for 1,442 yards in nine games that season, threw 19 passes for touchdowns, and completed 52 percent of his passes, all new collegiate records.  He was also among the leading punters in the nation.  He still holds the Columbia record for touchdown passes in one game (five). After graduating in 1943, he passed up offers from both professional baseball and football teams to enlist in the US Marines, where he served for three years. He went on to play for the National Football League's Boston Yanks and New York Giants (1946-1948). After a lackluster 1948 season, Governali retired from professional football and returned to Columbia, where he worked as an assistant coach while pursuing his doctorate in education, which he received in 1951. He returned to coaching football at San Diego State University for five years from 1956 to 1960.  The Aztecs had a lackluster record during those years and Governali was succeeded by Don Coryell, who led them to their best years. Governali was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1986. Paul Governali also had a minor stint as an actor, portraying a professional football player in the 1948 movie titled, \"Triple Threat.\" Paul Governali was married to Edna Governali with whom they had 4 children: Paul, Jeannie, Nicole, and Sam."

As of 2001, Moore held the Michigan Wolverines hockey record for most saves by a goaltender with 4,434.  He played for the University of Western Ontario for the 1976-77 season.  Moore was drafted by the New England Whalers of the World Hockey Association in the 11th round of the 1974 WHA Amateur Draft but he did not sign with the Whalers.  Although undrafted by the National Hockey League (NHL), he signed as a free agent with the NHL Philadelphia Flyers on November 7, 1978. Moore spent most of his first three professional hockey seasons with the Flyers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Maine Mariners.  In 1978\u201379, Moore shared the Mariners' goalie job with Pete Peeters and Rick St. Croix, posting a 3.38 goals against average in 26 games as the Mariners won the Calder Cup as the AHL champions.  The Mariners led the AHL in goals against average for the season, and Moore and Peeters shared the Harry \"Hap\" Holmes Memorial Award, awarded to the goalies who play at least 25 games for the team that leads the AHL with the lowest goals against average.  Moore also played five regular season games for the Flyers that season after Hall of Fame goalie Bernie Parent suffered a career-ending eye injury.  His NHL debut came on March 6, 1979 against the Colorado Rockies, and Moore registered a 5\u20130 shutout in his debut.  In his five NHL regular season games, Moore had a 1.77 goals against average and also earned one assist.  He ended up with two shutouts in his five NHL games, placing him in the top 10 for NHL shutouts that season, in a tie for 9th overall. Moore was also on the Flyers' roster for the 1979 playoffs.  He played five games in the playoffs as well, more than any other Flyers' goalie that season.  He had a 4.03 goals against average in the playoffs and one assist, as the Flyers won their first round playoff series against the Vancouver Canucks but lost to the New York Rangers in the second round. Moore spent the entire 1979-80 season with the Maine Mariners, sharing the goaltending duties primarily with St. Croix.  Moore played 32 games with a 3.51 goals against average. The Mariners again led the AHL in goals against average and Moore again earned the Harry \"Hap\" Holmes Memorial Award, sharing it with St. Croix this time. In 1980-81 Moore again played the entire season with the Mariners, playing 25 games with a 3.86 goals against average while sharing the goaltending job with Pelle Lindbergh and Sam St. Laurent.  The Mariners led the AHL in goals against average once again, and Moore earned his third consecutive Harry \"Hap\" Holmes Memorial Award, this time sharing the award with Lindbergh. After the 1980\u201381 season, Moore was signed as a free agent by the Minnesota North Stars.  Moore played the entire 1981\u201382 season for the Nashville South Stars of the Central Hockey League.  After the 1981\u20131982 season, Moore was traded with a draft choice to the Washington Capitals in exchange for Wes Jarvis and Rollie Boutin.  Moore spent most of the 1982\u201383 season with Washington's AHL affiliate Hershey Bears, but did play in one game for the Capitals that season.  Moore spent the 1983\u201384 season, his last as a professional, with the Milwaukee Admirals of the International Hockey League. Moore died in Sarnia on January 7, 2022, at the age of 67."

He was later called into the Iraq U-19s by Adnan Hamad. Against Pakistan, he was instrumental in the 6\u20130 demolition setting 2 goals in 6 minutes, the 2nd Nashat was involved in the beginning of a move on the Iraqi left, then he reappeared on the right-hand edge of the penalty area to put Emad Mohammed through with an exquisite back heel that took three defenders out of the play, leaving Emad free to score. He was a regular until he was replaced at half time against Korea Republic due to a tactical change, he later made appearances late on in games and created openings with his inspirational play. In the final Nashat's long ball forward caused confusion between Shohei Ikeda and his goalkeeper, which resulted in a weak clearing header by Fujigaya. The ball fell to Emad who hooked the ball over both players to score the winner. While many footballers are admired for their footwork or dominance in the air, Nashat Akram impresses with his cunning. After steering Iraq to their maiden success at the AFC Asian Cup 2007 with his intelligent midfield prompting, the cool-headed playmaker instantly became a popular figure across the continent. However, long before he made a name for himself at the senior level, Akram attracted attention across Asia when his creativity helped Iraq win the AFC Youth Championship 2000.

After a series of brilliant performances, which included helping the team to glory in the Umm Al-Marek Cup and reaching the Iraq FA Cup final in 2002, the midfield prodigy began to be heralded as one of Asia's most promising talents. And it did not take Akram long to live up to these sizeable expectations. Though still a teenager, he was instrumental in Iraq's qualification for both the Asian Cup 2004 and the Olympic Football Tournament Athens 2004. His excellent vision and defence-piercing passes \u2013 skills rarely seen in players his age \u2013 captivated national coach Adnan Hamad, who appointed Akram captain, despite being one of the youngest players on the senior team. Akram did not let his coach down and impressed throughout Iraq's campaign in the AFC Asian Cup 2004. He also revealed his goalscoring ability when he was on target in the 2\u20131 win over Saudi Arabia in the final group match, a result which sent them through to the last eight at the Saudis' expense. It was not the first goal that he scored for the national team, nor has it been the last. He hit the mark again in Iraq's memorable 3\u20131 win over Australia in a group match in the AFC Asian Cup 2007, before slamming home to seal a 2\u20131 victory over hosts China in a qualifier for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa. Despite winning the continental title, Iraq's disappointing qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup has left Akram and his teammates with the feeling that they still have something to prove. After making his national team debut against Saudi Arabia in a qualifying match for the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan, the 24-year-old also figured in Iraq's more recent qualifying campaigns, both times with little success. Iraq failed to progress to Asia's final round of qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany and they suffered a similar fate four years later when they failed to book their passage to South Africa."

        "content": "In 2006, Lincecum was drafted tenth overall by the San Francisco Giants, becoming the first player from the University of Washington to be taken in the first round. His $2.025 million signing bonus was, at the time, the most the organization had ever paid to any amateur player. Lincecum made his professional debut in 2006 with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Single-A short season Northwest League. Going into 2007, he was ranked as the #11 prospect in baseball and the #1 prospect in the San Francisco Giants organization by Baseball America. In the spring of 2007, Colorado Rockies prospect Ian Stewart described Lincecum as tough to face, saying \"You can\u2019t see the ball at all until it\u2019s right on top of you. It gets on you real quick...Guys on our club who have been in the big leagues said he\u2019s the toughest guy they ever faced too.\" Lincecum spent the first month of the season pitching for the Fresno Grizzlies, the Giants' Triple-A affiliate in the Pacific Coast League (PCL). In 31 innings across five starts with the Grizzlies, he allowed just one run, 12 hits, and 11 walks while striking out 46 batters and going 4\u20130. During his 2006 and 2007 minor league campaigns, Lincecum struck out 30.9% of batters, the highest ratio of any minor league pitcher in the previous ten years."

Lincecum struck out three batters in his first inning, the first being Chase Utley. Lincecum earned his first major league win five days later against the Rockies. His next two starts were against the Houston Astros, on May 17 and 22. After the first match-up, Astros third baseman Mike Lamb said, \"The stuff he was throwing out there tonight was everything he's hyped up to be. He was  with movement. You just don't see that every day. He pitched very much like the pitcher he is compared to and out-dueled him throughout the night.\" After recording a no decision in the first game, Lincecum pitched eight innings and got the win the second time. In July, Lincecum went 4\u20130 with a 1.62 ERA. On July 1, in a seven-inning performance against the Arizona Diamondbacks, he recorded 12 strikeouts and allowed just three hits in a 13\u20130 victory. Lincecum pitched into the ninth inning for the first time on August 21 against the Cubs, holding a 1\u20130 lead. He had allowed just two hits and one walk through the first eight, while throwing only 88 pitches. Cubs shortstop Ryan Theriot said after the game, \"He's got electric stuff. The best stuff I've seen all year.\" Lincecum was benched in September as a precaution due to the high number of innings he had pitched in his first full year of professional baseball. Between the minors and the majors, he pitched a total of  innings in the 2007 season."

        "content": "The Giants asked Lincecum not to throw bullpen sessions like the ones other pitchers typically throw during the off-season. Bruce Bochy, the manager of the Giants, told the San Francisco Chronicle that the team was being careful with Lincecum because of studies showing that pitchers who throw 200 innings in a season early in their careers are more susceptible to injuries. From April 2 through April 24, Lincecum won his first four decisions of the 2008 season. On May 15, Lincecum struck out 10 Astros in six innings. Houston first baseman Lance Berkman offered his view of Lincecum: \"He has three almost unhittable pitches...When he throws those off-speed pitches where he wants, you've got no chance.\" After his team fell to Lincecum and the Giants 6\u20133 on May 27, Diamondbacks first baseman Conor Jackson gave his impression of facing Lincecum: \"From what I saw tonight, that's the best arm I've seen all year, no doubt. You've got to almost hit a ball right down the middle. You're going to pop up the ball at your bellybutton, which we all did tonight, and the one down, it's coming in at , you're not going to put too much good wood on it. Even the ones down the middle are coming at 98. He's good, man.\" Lincecum was on the cover of the July 7, 2008, issue of Sports Illustrated. He was selected his first All-Star Game, but he was unavailable to play in it because he was hospitalized the day of the game due to flu-like symptoms. In a July 26 game against the Diamondbacks, he struck out 13 batters in seven innings while allowing seven hits, two earned runs, and no walks. On September 13, Lincecum pitched his first major league shutout against the San Diego Padres. In nine innings, he threw 138 pitches, gave up four hits and struck out 12 batters. Facing the Rockies on September 23, he recorded his 252nd strikeout of the season, breaking Jason Schmidt's 2004 single-season strikeout record. Lincecum finished the season with 265 strikeouts, making him the first San Francisco pitcher to win the National League (NL) strikeout title and the first Giant to do so since Bill Voiselle in 1944. Lincecum won 18 games, losing just five. On November 11, 2008, Lincecum was awarded the NL Cy Young Award, making him the second Giant (after Mike McCormick in 1967) to win the award. He finished 23rd in that year's NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award voting. After losing his first decision of 2009 on April 12 against the Padres, Lincecum won six in a row, not losing again until June 17. On June 2 at Nationals Park, Lincecum became the quickest Giants' pitcher to reach 500 strikeouts against the Washington Nationals' Cristian Guzm\u00e1n. In his six June starts, he went 4\u20131 with a 1.38 ERA and pitched three complete games. On July 3, Lincecum was announced as the NL Pitcher of the Month for June. He and fellow Giants starter Matt Cain were selected to the NL All-Star Team. Lincecum started the game for the NL, allowing two runs (one earned) in two innings pitched in the NL's eventual 4\u20133 loss. Through 20 starts in 2009, Lincecum had amassed an 11\u20133 record with a 2.30 ERA, 183 strikeouts, four complete games, and two shutouts. Lincecum also had a scoreless inning streak of 29 innings, the third-longest streak since the Giants moved to San Francisco from New York City prior to the 1958 season. On July 27, in a 4\u20132 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates at AT&T Park, Lincecum pitched a complete game and struck out a career-high 15 batters, the second most in San Francisco history (Schmidt struck out 16 in a 2006 game). On August 3, Lincecum was named the NL Player of the Week. Against the Padres on September 8, Lincecum missed his first regularly scheduled start in his major league career, due to back spasms. Lincecum finished the 2009 season with a 15\u20137 record, 2.48 ERA and 261 strikeouts. Following the season, Lincecum was named the Sporting News NL Pitcher of the Year for the second consecutive year. On November 19, Lincecum was awarded his second consecutive Cy Young Award, narrowly edging out St. Louis Cardinals pitchers Chris Carpenter and Adam Wainwright. In doing so, he became the first pitcher in MLB history to be awarded the Cy Young in each of his first two full seasons. He finished 18th in NL MVP voting."

However, from May 15 through May 31, he walked five batters in four consecutive starts. In June, he stopped walking so many hitters, striking out 10 hitters again on June 16 in a 6\u20133 win over the Baltimore Orioles. For the third year in a row, Lincecum was selected to the NL All-Star Team. As of the All-Star break, Lincecum was 9\u20134 with a 3.16 ERA over  innings pitched.  During the season's first half, he defeated Houston's Roy Oswalt three times in three months. All three games were pitchers' duels. After a disappointing August in which he experienced a five-game losing streak, Lincecum had a strong outing on September 1. Facing one of the league's top pitchers, Ubaldo Jim\u00e9nez, Lincecum pitched eight innings of one-run ball for his first win since July 30. He won five games in September, finishing the month 5\u20131. For the third year in a row, Lincecum won the NL strikeout title; he also set a record for most strikeouts by an MLB pitcher in his first four seasons. Lincecum finished the 2010 regular season with a 16\u201310 record, a 3.43 ERA and 231 strikeouts. On October 7, in Game 1 of the NL Division Series (NLDS), Lincecum pitched a complete-game two-hit shutout to defeat the Atlanta Braves in his first career postseason game. In his next postseason start, Lincecum outdueled fellow Cy Young Award winner Roy Halladay in a 4\u20133 victory over the Phillies in Game 1 of the NL Championship Series (NLCS). The two squared off again in Game 5 on October 21, in which Lincecum gave up three runs (two earned) over seven innings but suffered the loss in the 4\u20132 defeat. In Game 6 on October 23, with the Giants clinging to a one-run lead, Lincecum was summoned from the bullpen on one day's rest to pitch the bottom of the eighth inning. He struck out Jayson Werth before surrendering singles to the next two batters. Brian Wilson stranded the runners to end the eighth, and the Giants won the game 3\u20132, advancing to the World Series. In Game 1 of the series against the Texas Rangers, Lincecum committed what he called a \"brain fart\" in the first inning. With runners at first and third and one out, Lincecum caught Michael Young in a rundown between third base and home. However, instead of throwing towards Pablo Sandoval as he pursued Young to the bag, Lincecum kept the ball himself, allowing Young to scamper back safely. A double play helped him end the inning with only one run scoring, and though he ran into trouble in the next inning, Texas only managed to score one more run. The Giants tied the game in the third, then added six runs in the sixth, taking an 8\u20132 lead before Lincecum allowed two more runs in the sixth and departed. He earned the win in an eventual 11-7 triumph. With the Giants leading the series three games to one on November 1, Lincecum started Game 5. He recorded 10 strikeouts in eight innings while giving up only three hits en route to a 3\u20131 victory. The win ended the Giants' 56-year drought between World Series championships and also gave San Francisco its first baseball world championship."

Lincecum's total of 29 such games surpassed Hall of Fame \"first five\" inaugural member Christy Mathewson. While Mathewson accumulated his 28 ten-plus-strikeout games in 551 starts over 17 seasons with the Giants, Lincecum recorded 29 such games in 129 starts over five seasons. On May 21, he threw a three-hit shutout against the Oakland Athletics as San Francisco won 3\u20130. He recorded his 1,000th career strikeout on June 6, against Jerry Hairston, Jr. of the Nationals. Despite having the fourth-lowest ERA in the NL (2.74), including a second-half ERA of 2.31, Lincecum finished the 2011 season with a 13-14 record. Lincecum's so-so win-loss record was largely due to his receiving the worst run support in the major leagues; the Giants scored no runs in ten of his outings and scored two runs or fewer in 21 of them, making Lincecum one of only six pitchers in modern major league history to have at least 200 strikeouts, an ERA of less than 2.75, and a losing record."

        "content": "Lincecum reportedly rejected San Francisco's offer of a five-year, $100 million extension before the 2012 season. In January 2012, he instead signed a two-year, $40.5 million deal with the Giants, leaving him eligible for free agency after the 2013 season. Lincecum's career began a downturn in 2012. After winning back-to-back games on April 23 (against the Mets) and 28 (against the Padres), he lost six decisions in a row, not winning again until he threw seven shutout innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 22. At the All-Star break, he had a 3\u201310 record and a 6.42 ERA. However, Lincecum improved in the second half of the season, winning seven of his last 12 decisions and posting a 3.83 ERA. In his first game after the All-Star break, he pitched eight shutout innings and struck out 11. Closer Santiago Casilla gave up two runs in the 9th inning, but the Giants won 3-2.  He finished the season with a 10\u201315 record and 190 strikeouts. The 190 strikeouts were 10th-best in the NL, but Lincecum also led the league in losses (15) and wild pitches (17; highest total in MLB). His 5.18 ERA for the season was nearly double what it had been the year before. With the Giants only needing four starters for the playoffs, Lincecum was used as a relief pitcher in the postseason. In Game 2 of the NLDS against the Cincinnati Reds, Lincecum threw two shutout innings, though the Giants would lose 9\u20130.  He picked up the win in Game 4 of the NLDS, throwing  innings of relief and allowing just one run as the Giants won 8\u20133 to force a deciding Game 5, which they would also win. After Lincecum pitched two hitless innings in Game 1 of the NLCS against the Cardinals, Bochy decided to give him the start in Game 4. Lincecum gave up four runs in  innings, taking the loss in San Francisco's 8\u20133 defeat. That loss put the Giants down three games to one in the series, but they won the next three games, advancing to the World Series for the second time in three years. In Game 1 of the World Series, Lincecum relieved Barry Zito with two outs in the sixth inning, getting the last out and throwing two further scoreless innings as the Giants defeated the Detroit Tigers by a score of 8\u20133. Lincecum relieved Ryan Vogelsong with two outs in the sixth inning of Game 3, again throwing  scoreless innings, this time in a 2\u20130 victory.  The Giants swept the Series for their second title in three seasons."

        "content": "During the 2012 offseason, Lincecum used a conditioning program to improve his coordination. His performance in spring training in 2013 was lackluster, as he posted a 10.57 ERA. Cain and Madison Bumgarner were both ahead of him in the rotation to start the season. On July 13, Lincecum no-hit the Padres 9\u20130 at Petco Park, the first no-hitter ever pitched in that stadium and the first of his career. He struck out 13 batters and walked four while throwing a career-high 148 pitches. Lincecum finished the first half of his season with a losing record (5\u20139), but his 4.26 ERA was lower than what it had been in the first half of 2012 (6.42). Lincecum pitched to an ERA of 4.54 in the second half of the 2013 season; however, the Giants bullpen accounted for an unusually high 12 earned runs charged to Lincecum. In 32 starts in 2013, Lincecum went 10\u201314 with a 4.37 ERA, striking out 193 in  innings. By the end of the year, he had 1,510 strikeouts, the third-highest total by a pitcher over his first seven years (behind Tom Seaver's 1,655 and Bert Blyleven's 1,546). On October 22, Lincecum signed a two-year, $35 million contract, which prevented him from becoming a free agent. With Tim Hudson joining the Giants in 2014, Lincecum fell to fourth in the Giants rotation to start the year. On May 12, Lincecum struck out 11 in  one-run innings as the Giants defeated the Braves 4\u20132. He had a no-hitter going against the Cubs on May 28 but was removed after five innings, partly because a blister was forming on his middle finger. The no-hitter lasted until the seventh, when John Baker recorded a hit against Jeremy Affeldt, but the Giants still won 5\u20130. On June 25, Lincecum pitched his tenth career complete game and second career no-hitter. It was his second against the Padres and the third no-hitter in the short history of AT&T Park. With his second no-hit performance against the Padres, Lincecum became the second player in MLB history to throw two no-hitters against the same team (joining Hall of Famer Addie Joss) and the first in Major League history to do it in back-to-back seasons. Against the Phillies on July 22, Lincecum inherited runners at second base and third base with only one out in the 14th inning of a game the Giants led 9\u20135 over the Phillies. Only the runner at third scored, as Lincecum recorded the final two outs. With the save, Lincecum became the fifth pitcher since 1976 to pitch a no-hitter and record a save in the same season, joining Matt Garza, Chris Bosio, Jerry Reuss, and John Candelaria. After posting a 9.49 ERA in six games from July 25 through August 23, Lincecum was replaced in the Giants rotation by Yusmeiro Petit. Bochy initially indicated that the move might only be for one start, but Lincecum would spend the rest of the season in the bullpen. On September 25, Lincecum threw two pitches, retiring Alexi Amarista to end the seventh inning, then became the pitcher of record as the Giants took the lead in the bottom of the inning. He won his 100th career game in a 9\u20138 victory over the Padres at AT&T Park. In 33 games (but only 26 starts), he had a 12\u20139 record, a 4.74 ERA, and 134 strikeouts in  innings pitched. Lincecum was the only player on the Giants' 25-man roster who was not used during the NLDS and the NLCS. He finally made an appearance in Game 2 of the 2014 World Series against the Kansas City Royals, entering to start the bottom of the seventh inning and retiring all five batters he faced. Lincecum left the game in the eighth inning with lower back tightness. He did not pitch again in the series, but the Giants defeated the Royals in seven games, giving Lincecum the third World Series championship of his career. Through May 3, 2015, Lincecum posted a 2\u20132 record, a 2.40 ERA, 20 strikeouts, and 11 walks in 30 innings pitched. He threw eight shutout innings in a victory over the Los Angeles Angels on May 3, then struck out eight over six shutout innings in a win over the Miami Marlins on May 8. On May 20, in a 4\u20130 win over the Dodgers, Lincecum pitched seven shutout innings and passed Hall of Famer Carl Hubbell for fourth place in franchise history on the Giants all-time career strikeouts list. On June 27, Lincecum was hit in his pitching elbow with a line drive off the bat of DJ LeMahieu and left the game with an injury. He was diagnosed with a degenerative condition in both hips in July and was given cortisone shots. Still not having pitched since June 27, Lincecum underwent season-ending hip surgery on September 3. For the season, he was 7\u20134 with a 4.13 ERA and 60 strikeouts. He became a free agent after the season."

In September 2019, Lincecum appeared at a postgame ceremony held by the Giants to mark Bochy's final game as the team's manager. In an interview at the ceremony, Lincecum acknowledged that he had not formally retired from baseball and was \"trying to transition\".

        "content": "When pitching, Lincecum would start with his back slightly to the plate, his left leg raised, and his glove held over his head. Then, he would take a step of about seven feet forward, maneuvering his hips over the place his left foot was now planted as he released the ball. This helped him to generate high velocity despite his slight build. The power behind the throws was generated not just from the arm, but also from the long stride and the hip muscles. Sportswriters Bob Nightengale and Robert Falkoff both thought that Lincecum was a similar pitcher to Roy Oswalt. Lincecum threw a four-seam fastball, but mostly used a two-seam fastball which he threw for more sinking movement to get more ground balls. This pitch had little lateral movement due to his overhand delivery and the speed at which the pitch was thrown. He had a curveball which broke away from right-handed hitters. These were his primary pitches when he first reached the major leagues, but as his career progressed, he added two more.  In 2007, he added a changeup with a grip similar to that of a split-finger fastball. A fast pitch, his changeup appeared similar to his fastball for the first , but then dove down sharply and tailed away from left-handed batters. The changeup was his favorite pitch to throw with two strikes. He had thrown a slider in college, and he started using it again in 2008, throwing it far more often by 2011. The slider was a pitch he used when ahead in the count, as he preferred to rely on his fastball when he was behind. The fastball averaged  in 2008 and  in 2009, but by 2014 it was averaging less than . His other pitches were typically in the high-70/low-80\u00a0mph range (approximately 128.75\u00a0km/h); these also slowed slightly as his career progressed."

Fox Sports in 2014 called him a \"local legend and crowd favorite, now and forever.\" Lincecum was nicknamed \"The Freak\" by his University of Washington teammates because of his athletic abilities and his ability to generate powerful pitches from his athletic but slight physique. Giants fans continued to refer to him by the moniker during his time with the team.

While at Wrexham, he was responsible for one of the most memorable moments in the club's history, a vital away goal in a 4\u20133 defeat against Porto in the first round of the European Cup-Winners' Cup in October 1984. Wrexham had won the first leg 1\u20130, and Horne's 89th-minute strike ensured that they progressed to the second round of the competition, where they lost to Roma. He captained the Welsh national team and won the FA Cup in 1995 whilst playing for Everton, the team he supports. His Welsh senior debut came on 9 September 1987, aged 25, in a 1\u20130 win over Denmark in a Euro 88 qualifier at Cardiff Arms Park. The last of his 59 caps for Wales came a decade later on 29 March 1997 in a 2\u20131 home win over Belgium in a World Cup qualifier, also at Cardiff Arms Park. His most successful spell as a player was at Everton between 1992 and 1996. Horne's most famous goal in an Everton shirt came on the final day of the 1993\u201394 season against Wimbledon. Everton had to win to survive relegation. Horne's goal, a 30-yard screamer, levelled the scores at 2\u20132. Graham Stuart would go on to score the winning goal to secure Everton's Premiership status. It was the only goal Horne had scored in the FA Carling Premiership that season. Soon after he won Everton's Footballer of the Year 1995 award. At the start of the previous season, he had the distinction of scoring Everton's first Premier League goal, a 44th-minute equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Sheffield Wednesday.

Considered one of the best cover cornerbacks of his day, Wright played in ten NFL seasons, from 1981\u20131990, all for the 49ers including starting on four Super Bowl-winning teams. Wright made a key defensive play in the NFC Championship game on January 10, 1982 against the Dallas Cowboys. On the Cowboys' last possession in the final minute, after Dwight Clark had made The Catch, Wright made a touchdown-saving horse-collar tackle on Cowboy wide receiver Drew Pearson to preserve the 49er win and propel them into their first Super Bowl. A two-time Pro Bowler, Wright's peak performance year was during the 1983 season when he intercepted 7 passes for 164 yards and 2 touchdowns. He intercepted passes in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XIX. Wright missed a majority of the 1986 and 1987 seasons with a deep groin pull and chipped bone in the area, missing all but 4 games during the two-year stretch. But he returned as a starter in 1988 and was on the 49ers-back-to-back Super Bowl-winning teams. Wright is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.  He is currently an alumni coordinator for the 49ers."

He was recalled by the Brewers from Nashville on June 14, 2009 and pitched in his first game with Milwaukee on June 15. He was outrighted to Nashville on July 13 after being designated for assignment. He was called up again on August 21 and appeared in a game the next day, earning his first major league win. He entered the Brewers starting rotation on September 13 making a spot start in place of Manny Parra and gained his first major league win as a starter on September 23, striking out 10 in the process. Narveson made the Brewers roster in 2010 with the intention of him being a long distance reliever and a spot starter. However, the struggles of Manny Parra gave Narveson the chance to start and he ended up being the Brewers 5th starter for the second half of the season. Narveson finished the season with a 12\u20139 record in 28 starts, a 4.99 ERA, and 137 strikeouts in 167.2 innings pitched. Narveson was named the 5th starter on a revamped Brewers starting rotation for 2011. He started 28 games for the Brewers in 2011 and finished with an 11\u20138 record, with a 4.45 ERA and 126 strikeouts in 161 innings pitched. Narveson just missed starting 30 games on the season, but due to an injury on his left thumb caused by a pair of scissors, Narveson missed 2 of his scheduled starts. Narveson missed almost all of the 2012 season due to an injury to, and surgery on his throwing arm's torn rotator cuff. He had a 1\u20131 record in 2 starts, with an ERA of 7.00. He was replaced as a starter by Marco Estrada. He became a free agent on October 1, 2013."

As a 16-year-old rookie in 1943, he was the youngest player to appear in a National League game that season. McKee was one of many ballplayers who appeared in the Major Leagues only during World War II. He made his major league debut on August 18, 1943, in a home doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals at Shibe Park. The best game of his short career, however, came on October 3, 1943, the last day of the season, when he started the second game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field and pitched a complete game, winning 11\u20133. The losing pitcher was Cookie Cuccurullo, who was making his major league debut. Then, at 17, McKee became the youngest pitcher in the 20th century to throw a nine-inning complete-game victory on the final day of the regular season, a feat no one has accomplished since. McKee made his last pitching appearance for the Phillies on September 26, 1944. Overall, he posted a 1\u20130 record and a 5.87 earned run average in five games (one start), allowing 10 runs on 14 hits and six walks, while striking out one in 15 innings of work. He later switched to outfield and spent nine seasons in the minor Leagues spanning 1944\u201357, collecting a batting average of .287 and 115 home runs in 1,173 games. In 2014, McKee died in his hometown of Shelby, North Carolina, 15 days short before of his 88th birthday."

Then on December 8 \u2013 he completed 21 of 40 passes for 330 yards for two touchdowns, including a 45-yard game winning strike to wide receiver Michael Timpson in overtime against the Indianapolis Colts. During the 1992 season, Millen shared quarterback duties with three others; Tommy Hodson, Scott Zolak, and Jeff Carlson. He led all Patriot quarterbacks with 1,203 passing yards and 8 touchdown passes, but New England's final record was a poor 2-14. Millen suffered a third degree separated shoulder on the seventh play of the season, but still managed to play in 7 games with the persistent injury. The Patriots 2-14 record led to a complete overhaul of the team and franchise in 1993. On April 26, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a seventh round draft choice (#222-Marty Moore). With the #1 overall pick in the 1993 NFL Draft, the Patriots selected Washington State quarterback Drew Bledsoe."

Steve Beuerlein \u2013 the backup quarterback from the previous year \u2013 had signed with the Phoenix Cardinals as a free agent. Aikman was expected to miss six to 12 weeks at the time, as he rehabbed from his surgery, while Millen and Jason Garrett would fill the void in the meantime. Millen himself had separated his left shoulder three times during the previous season. As it turned out, Millen never did attempt a pass in the regular season, as Aikman healed well from his injury and Garrett passed him on the depth chart for the backup position. On November 10, the Cowboys signed quarterback Bernie Kosar after he had been released by the Cleveland Browns midway during the season and Millen was cut to make room for him."

Langley's stay with the Bees did not last long however - his height of 5 feet 9\u00a0inches apparently counting against him with manager Harry Curtis - and the Londoner was soon looking for another club. As with many youngsters his age, Langley was called upon to do national service and it was while he was still in the army that Langley joined Guildford City in 1948. After a season playing with the Southern League side as an amateur, during which they narrowly avoided relegation, Langley turned professional in 1949."

He played mostly in mop-up duty and even saw action on special teams during his first two seasons in the league, but when Oilers' QB Warren Moon was traded to the Vikings, Houston's quarterback position was up for grabs. Incumbent backup Cody Carlson began the 1994 season under center, but when he separated his shoulder in the season opener, Richardson became the starting quarterback. He is fondly remembered during a preseason exhibition game against the Dallas Cowboys. Late in the game and down by one score, Richardson led the Oilers within striking distance. The drive culminated with a play during which he, a right-hander, completed the winning touchdown pass with his left arm. Richardson was the starter for nearly half of the season and he split time with Carlson and Billy Joe Tolliver, none of the three being particularly effective as the Oilers stumbled their way to a league-worst 2\u201314 record. In Richardson's last regular season game as a pro, he passed for over 200 yards, leading the Oilers in a 24\u201310 victory over the New York Jets in the Oilers' 1994 season finale in what was Jeff Fisher's first win as an NFL head coach. The Oilers released Richardson after drafting Steve McNair in April 1995. The Dallas Cowboys signed Richardson in August 1995, planning to use him on special teams and to back up Daryl Johnston at fullback; however, Richardson did not see any regular-season action. The Kansas City Chiefs signed him the following year and he capped off a 1996 preseason victory with a touchdown pass for the Chiefs against his former team the Cowboys. Despite his preseason heroics, Richardson never saw action in another regular-season NFL game. He finished his career with 1,257 passing yards and 225 rushing yards on a 6.8 yards per carry average."

Coleman racked up 22 tackles in 2009. He finished the 2010 season with 41 tackles, four sacks, five forced fumbles and one interception. Coleman made his first impact of the season by filling in for an injured Darrelle Revis against the New England Patriots in week 2. Coleman impressed greatly as he was part of a Jets defense that did not allow a touchdown in the second half of the game, which is where he made his biggest impact. In the next game against the Miami Dolphins, Coleman continued to make impact plays as he intercepted Chad Henne at the end of the game, preventing a comeback for the Dolphins. Against the Vikings the next week he would sack Brett Favre, and finish the game against the Vikings with 3 tackles and 1 sack. In week 6 he recorded 5 tackles in a win against the Denver Broncos. His most impressive game of the season came against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 15. Coleman recorded 10 tackles, 2 sacks and 2 forced fumbles.

Later that month, he was backed by Diego Maradona to become \"Argentina's next superstar\". On 27 February 2010, Di Mar\u00eda scored his first hat-trick in a classic 4\u20130 win against Leix\u00f5es. The next day, he made the headlines as \"Magic Tri Mar\u00eda\" in all sports newspapers in Portugal."

He signed a five-year contract for \u20ac25\u00a0million, plus \u20ac11\u00a0million in incentives, as announced one day later by the Portuguese Stock Exchange regulating entity. On 7 July 2010, Di Mar\u00eda arrived to Madrid directly from Buenos Aires, and passed the medical test on 8 July. He made his debut on 4 August 2010 in a friendly match against Mexican side Am\u00e9rica, which Real Madrid won 3\u20132. On 22 August, Di Mar\u00eda scored his first goal in another friendly away against H\u00e9rcules, which Real Madrid won 1\u20133. In the last match of the pre-season, on 24 August, after an individual play described as a \"magic moment\", he opened the score of the 2\u20130 win against Pe\u00f1arol for the Trofeo Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. His league debut came on 29 August in a 0\u20130 draw against Mallorca. On 18 September, Di Mar\u00eda scored his first league goal for Real Madrid in their 1\u20132 away win over Real Sociedad. Ten days later, he scored his first goal in the UEFA Champions League against Auxerre in a 0\u20131 victory. He scored a controversial first goal against Sevilla on 19 December. Days later, Di Mar\u00eda assisted Karim Benzema's two goals and Cristiano Ronaldo's goal in an astonishing 8\u20130 drubbing of Levante on 22 December. In the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 against Lyon, he scored the third and final goal in a 3\u20130 win to send Real Madrid through to the quarter-finals for the first time in seven years. Di Mar\u00eda scored Real Madrid's third goal during their first-leg Champions League quarter-final victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 5 April 2011. On 20 April, he was sent off in the 31st minute of extra time in the Copa del Rey final against rivals Barcelona. Real Madrid won the match 1\u20130, the lone goal of the match (in the 13th minute of extra time) being a header from Cristiano Ronaldo, which came from his cross, thus obtaining his first honour with Real Madrid."

        "content": "During the start of the 2011\u201312 season, Di Mar\u00eda endured a tough series of matches as he struggled to adapt to the pace of the league following the summer break. As a result, Di Mar\u00eda's early performance for the season was mixed with moments of genuinely good play interspersed with moments of sheer madness by the Argentine. This point was well illustrated during Real Madrid's 1\u20130 defeat to Levante, a match which saw a clearly out-of-sorts Di Mar\u00eda commit a horror foul on Levante's Juanfran during the match. Di Mar\u00eda caused the two teams to clash and an on-field incident ensued. However, Di Mar\u00eda's performances would improve, including opening up a significant gap at the top of the assists table. From October 2011, Di Mar\u00eda was being picked by Madrid head coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho ahead of Kak\u00e1 and Mesut \u00d6zil, a sign of his improving form. On 27 November 2011, Di Mar\u00eda played 60 minutes in a league match against city rivals Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, in which he scored a goal for Real Madrid. Mourinho's team won the match 4\u20131. On 3 December 2011, Di Mar\u00eda scored Real's first goal from a sharp angle in a 3\u20130 defeat of Sporting de Gij\u00f3n in La Liga. He was a constant threat and presence in the starting XI as Real Madrid won their 32nd league title, playing in their 3\u20130 win over Athletic Bilbao that clinched the league title."

Although Di Mar\u00eda did not have the best season, he did contribute in big moments, most notably by sending in the cross for Cristiano Ronaldo's goal against Manchester United on 13 February, he registered seventeen assists, and scored nine goals throughout the season in 52 appearances, notably against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and M\u00e1laga. On 9 August 2012, Di Mar\u00eda signed a new contract with Real Madrid, keeping him at the club until 2018. On 2 October 2013, Di Mar\u00eda scored two goals against Copenhagen in Real Madrid's 4\u20130 Champions League victory over them. Later in the season, due to tactical decisions by the club's new manager Carlo Ancelotti, Di Mar\u00eda's playing position was permanently switched to that of an offensive\u2013minded central midfielder, and he was frequently deployed in the starting line-up alongside Luka Modri\u0107 and Xabi Alonso in midfield in the team's 4\u20133\u20133 formation. He contributed to the club's 1\u20132 victory over Barcelona in the 2014 Copa del Rey Final with the opening goal. Di Mar\u00eda was the top assist maker in La Liga for the season, contributing 17. In the 2014 UEFA Champions League Final against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on 24 May 2014, Di Mar\u00eda dribbled past two players before producing a save from goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Di Mar\u00eda's teammate Gareth Bale, was there to head the rebound into the net in the 110th minute, giving Real Madrid a 2\u20131 lead over Atl\u00e9tico in an eventual 4\u20131 win. Di Mar\u00eda was named man of the match by UEFA after the match, and was presented with the honour by former Manchester United head coach Sir Alex Ferguson. Di Mar\u00eda was an unused substitute as Real Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla on 12 August. A week later, in the first leg of the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, he played the final 15 minutes of a 1\u20131 home draw against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in place of Luka Modri\u0107."

He inherited the number 7 shirt at United, which was previously worn by club legends such as George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. Di Mar\u00eda made his debut on 30 August in a 0\u20130 draw with Burnley, in which he was substituted for Anderson after 70 minutes. He scored his first goal for United on 14 September, netting directly from a free-kick in a 4\u20130 win over Queens Park Rangers. He also provided an assist for Juan Mata's goal in the same match, winning the vote for Man of the Match. His performance was highlighted by Sky Sports' Player Cam feature, which was brought back especially for the match. In the next match, against Leicester City on 21 September, he again scored a goal and provided another assist, although United lost the match 5\u20133. On 2 October, Di Mar\u00eda won Manchester United's Player of the Month award for September after recording two goals and two assists in his first four matches for the club. One week later, he won his second individual trophy at United after his goal against Leicester, in which he chipped goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, was voted as the club's Goal of the Month for September. Di Mar\u00eda continued his run of fine form on 5 October by scoring a goal and providing an assist for Radamel Falcao to help United defeat Everton 2\u20131. Di Mar\u00eda was substituted with a hamstring injury 13 minutes into United's 3\u20130 defeat of Hull City on 29 November and subsequently made only one substitute appearance in the team's next seven matches. On 4 January 2015, Di Mar\u00eda returned from injury to score a late goal in a 0\u20132 win against Yeovil Town in the third round of the FA Cup. A week later, he was used as a forward by manager Louis van Gaal in a 0\u20131 home defeat to Southampton. This new role came in the midst of a bad run of form for Di Mar\u00eda, who was said to have struggled since October. Di Mar\u00eda was sent off on 9 March as United lost 1\u20132 at home against Arsenal in the FA Cup sixth round, being booked for diving and for grabbing the shirt of referee Michael Oliver, but earlier set up the equaliser by Wayne Rooney. At the season's end, Di Mar\u00eda was judged by The Daily Telegraph to be the worst signing of the season."

He had 2 sacks in the season finale against the San Francisco 49ers and in the playoff loss against the Minnesota Vikings. In 1989, he suffered a right knee injury early in training camp, missing all of the preseason and the season opener. He still was able to become a starter at inside linebacker, registering 63 tackles (fifth on the team), 2 sacks, 2 interceptions and 6 passes defensed. He missed 3 games with an ankle injury he suffered in the sixth game against the Buffalo Bills. He had 10 tackles and 2 interceptions in the season finale against the New England Patriots. In 1990, the Rams took advantage of his versatility as a player, creating a position called \"nose linebacker\", that rushed the quarterback, dropped back in coverage and took on offensive lineman in the running game. On October 15, he was placed on the injured reserve list with a fractured left fibula. He was fourth on the team with 25 tackles at the time. In 1991, he made 29 tackles (23 solo), one sack, 2 passes defensed and one forced fumble. He missed 2 games after suffering a sprained knee in the second game against the New York Giants. In 1992, he was passed on the depth chart at middle linebacker by Larry Kelm, playing mainly on special teams and short yardage situations. He collected 7 tackles and 8 special teams tackles."

        "content": "Orenthal James Simpson (born July 9, 1947), nicknamed \"the Juice\", is an American former football running back, broadcaster, actor, and advertising spokesman. Once a popular figure with the U.S. public, he is now best known for being tried for the murders of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. Simpson was initially acquitted of the murders in criminal court but was later found responsible for both deaths in a civil trial. Simpson attended the University of Southern California (USC), where he played football for the USC Trojans and won the Heisman Trophy in 1968. He played professionally as a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons, primarily with the Buffalo Bills from 1969 to 1977. He also played for the San Francisco 49ers from 1978 to 1979. In 1973, he became the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season. He holds the record for the single-season yards-per-game average, which stands at 143.1. He was the only player to rush for over 2,000 yards in the 14-game regular season NFL format. Simpson was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985. After retiring from football, he began new careers in acting and football broadcasting. In 1994, Simpson was arrested and charged with the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman. He was acquitted by a jury after a lengthy and internationally publicized trial. The families of the victims subsequently filed a civil suit against him. A civil court awarded a $33.5 million judgment against him in 1997 for the victims' wrongful deaths. In 2000, Simpson moved to Miami, Florida to avoid paying on the liability judgment, which as of 2021 remained mostly unpaid. In 2007, Simpson was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, and charged with the felonies of armed robbery and kidnapping. In 2008, he was convicted and sentenced to 33 years' imprisonment, with a minimum of nine years without parole. He served his sentence at the Lovelock Correctional Center near Lovelock, Nevada. Simpson was granted parole on July 20, 2017, which was the minimum sentence. He was eligible for release from prison on October 1, 2017, and was released on that date. On December 14, 2021, Simpson was granted early release from his parole by the Nevada Division of Parole and Probation."

His father was a well-known drag queen in the San Francisco Bay Area. Later in life, Jimmy Simpson announced that he was gay and died of AIDS in 1986. Simpson's maternal grandparents were from Louisiana, and his aunt gave him the name Orenthal, which she said was the name of a French actor she liked. He was called \"O. J.\" from birth and did not know that Orenthal was his given name until a teacher read it in third grade. Simpson has one brother, Melvin Leon \"Truman\" Simpson, one living sister, Shirley Simpson-Baker, and one deceased sister, Carmelita Simpson-Durio. As a child, Simpson developed rickets and wore braces on his legs until the age of five, giving him his bowlegged stance. His parents separated in 1952, and Simpson was raised by his mother. Simpson grew up in San Francisco and lived with his family in the housing projects of the Potrero Hill neighborhood. In his early teenage years, he joined a street gang called the Persian Warriors and was briefly incarcerated at the San Francisco Youth Guidance Center. Future wife Marquerite, his childhood sweetheart, described Simpson as \"really an awful person then\"; after his third arrest, a meeting with Willie Mays during which the baseball star encouraged Simpson to avoid trouble helped persuade him to reform. At Galileo High School (currently Galileo Academy of Science and Technology) in San Francisco, Simpson played for the school football team, the Galileo Lions. He graduated in 1965."

        "content": "Although Simpson was an All-City football player at Galileo, his mediocre high-school grades prevented him from attracting the interest of many college recruiters. After a childhood friend's injury in the Vietnam War influenced Simpson to stay out of the military, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco in 1965. He played football both ways as a running back and defensive back and was named to the Junior College All-American team as a running back. City College won the Prune Bowl against Long Beach State, and many colleges sought Simpson as a transfer student for football. Simpson chose to attend the University of Southern California (USC), which he had admired as a young football fan, over the University of Utah and played running back for head coach John McKay in 1967 and 1968. Simpson led the nation in rushing both years under McKay: in 1967 with 1,543 yards and 13 touchdowns, and in 1968 with 1,880 yards on 383 carries. As a junior in 1967, Simpson was a close runner-up in the Heisman Trophy balloting to quarterback Gary Beban of UCLA. In that year's Victory Bell rivalry game between the teams, USC was down by six points in the fourth quarter with under eleven minutes remaining. On their own 36, USC backup quarterback Toby Page called an audible on third and seven. Simpson's 64-yard touchdown run tied the score, and the extra point provided a 21\u201320 lead, which was the final score. This was the biggest play in what is regarded as one of the greatest football games of the 20th century. Another dramatic touchdown in the same game is the subject of the Arnold Friberg oil painting, O.J. Simpson Breaks for Daylight. Simpson also won the Walter Camp Award in 1967 and was a two-time consensus All-American. Simpson was an aspiring track athlete; in 1967 he lost a 100 m race at Stanford against the then-British record holder Menzies Campbell. Prior to playing football at Southern Cal, he ran in the USC sprint relay quartet that broke the world record in the 4 \u00d7 110-yard relay at the NCAA track championships in Provo, Utah on June 17, 1967. As a senior in 1968, Simpson rushed for 1,709 yards and 22 touchdowns in the regular season, earning the Heisman Trophy, the Maxwell Award, and Walter Camp Award. He held the record for the Heisman's largest margin of victory for 51 years, defeating runner-up Leroy Keyes by 1,750 points. In the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day, #2 USC faced top-ranked Ohio State; Simpson ran for 171 yards, including an 80-yard touchdown run in a 27\u201316 loss."

        "content": "The first selection 1969 AFL\u2013NFL Common Draft was held by the AFL's Buffalo Bills, after finishing 1\u201312\u20131 in 1968. They took Simpson, but he demanded what was then the largest contract in professional sports history: $650,000 over five years. This led to a standoff with Bills' owner Ralph Wilson, as Simpson threatened to become an actor and skip professional football. Eventually, Wilson agreed to pay Simpson. Simpson entered professional football with high expectations, but struggled in his first three years, averaging only 622 yards per season. Bills coach John Rauch, not wanting to build an offense around one running back, assigned Simpson to do blocking and receiving duties at the expense of running the ball. In 1971, Rauch resigned as head coach and the Bills brought in Harvey Johnson. Despite Johnson devising a new offense for Simpson, Simpson was still ineffective that year. After the 1971 season, the Bills fired Johnson and brought in Lou Saban as head coach. Unlike Rauch, Saban made Simpson the centerpiece of the Bills offense. In 1972, Simpson rushed for over 1,000 yards for the first time in his career, gaining a league-leading total of 1,251 yards. In 1973, Simpson became the first player to break the highly coveted 2,000 yard rushing mark, with 2,003 total rushing yards and 12 touchdowns. Simpson broke the mark during the last game of the season against the New York Jets with a seven-yard rush. That same game also saw Simpson break Jim Brown's single-season rushing record of 1,863 yards. For his performance, Simpson won that year's NFL MVP Award and Bert Bell Award. While other players have broken the 2,000-yard mark since Simpson, his record was established in a time when the NFL had only 14 games per season, as opposed to the 16-game seasons that began in 1978. Simpson still holds the rushing record for 14 games. Simpson gained more than 1,000 rushing yards for each of his next three seasons. He did not lead the league in rushing in 1974, but did cross the 1,000-yard barrier despite a knee injury. In game 11 of 1974, he passed Ken Willard as the rushing leader among active players, a position he maintained until his retirement more than five seasons later. Simpson also made his first and only playoff appearance during the 1974 season. In a divisional game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Simpson rushed for 49 yards on 15 attempts and caught a touchdown pass, but the Bills lost the game 32\u201314. Simpson won the rushing title again in 1975, rushing for 1,817 yards and 16 touchdowns. Simpson also had a career-high 426 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns that season. Simpson once again led the league in rushing in 1976, rushing for 1,503 yards and eight touchdowns. Simpson had the best game of his career during that season's Thanksgiving game against the Detroit Lions on November 25. In that game, Simpson rushed for a then-record 273 yards on 29 attempts and scored two touchdowns. Despite Simpson's performance, the Bills would lose the game 27\u201314. A low light that season came during a game against the Patriots a few weeks earlier when defensive end Mel Lunsford and several other Patriots defenders stuffed the superstar running back for no gain but as Simpson tried to continue driving forward Lunsford bodyslammed him to the ground. Simpson got up and punched Lunsford which prompted Lunsford to swing back. Bills offensive lineman Reggie McKenzie then jumped on Lunsford's back but Lunsford bent down and flung McKenzie over his head and went back to swinging at Simpson before a melee of the two teams stopped the fight and ended up in a pile on the field. Lunsford and Simpson were both ejected from the game as the Patriots solid defense persisted with New England going on to win 20\u201310 on their way to finishing the 1976 season 11\u20133. The Bills finished 2\u201312. Simpson played in only seven games in 1977, as his season was cut short by injury."

He was the only player in NFL history to rush for over 2,000 yards in a 14-game season and he is the only player to rush for over 200 yards in six different games in his career. From 1972 to 1976, Simpson averaged 1,540 rushing yards per (14 game) season, 5.1 yards per carry, and he won the NFL rushing title four times. Simpson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985, his first year of eligibility. In 2019, he was named to the National Football League 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Simpson played in only one playoff game during his 11-season Hall of Fame career: a 1974 Divisional Round game between the Buffalo Bills and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Simpson was held to 49 rushing yards on fifteen carries to go with three receptions for 37 yards and a touchdown as the Bills lost 32\u201314. Simpson acquired the nickname \"Juice\" as a play on \"O.J.\", a common abbreviation for orange juice. \"Juice\" is also a colloquial synonym for electricity or electrical power, and hence a metaphor for any powerful entity; the Bills' offensive line at Simpson's peak was nicknamed \"The Electric Company\"."

He became a professional actor before playing professional football, appearing in the first episode of Medical Center while negotiating his contract with the Bills. While in the NFL Simpson appeared in productions such as the television miniseries Roots (1977), and the dramatic motion pictures The Klansman (1974), The Towering Inferno (1974), The Cassandra Crossing (1976), and Capricorn One (1978). In 1979, he started his own film production company, Orenthal Productions, which dealt mostly in made-for-TV fare such as the family-oriented Goldie and the Boxer films with Melissa Michaelsen (1979 and 1981), and Cocaine and Blue Eyes (1983), a television movie broadcast by NBC. Simpson said that he did not seriously consider an acting career until seeing Lee Marvin and Richard Burton, while filming The Klansman in Oroville, California, ordering chili from Chasen's via private jet. He said in 1980 that \"The Oscar or the Emmy says you've reached a level of competence in this business, and I would love to have one\". Simpson avoided starring in blaxploitation films, choosing third or fourth lead roles while studying experienced stars like Marvin and Burton. The Hertz commercials from 1975 benefited Simpson's acting career but he sometimes intentionally chose non-positive roles; \"I've got to tear down that picture of O.J. Simpson, the clean-cut athlete, to get believability into whatever part I happen to be playing\". Simpson also starred in the comedic Back to the Beach (1987) and The Naked Gun trilogy (1988, 1991, 1994). According to Arnold Schwarzenegger, Simpson was considered by director James Cameron to play the eponymous character in The Terminator (1984) when Schwarzenegger was cast as Kyle Reese, but Cameron ultimately cast Schwarzenegger as the Terminator while Simpson had no involvement in the film. Besides his acting career, Simpson worked as a commentator for Monday Night Football and The NFL on NBC. He also appeared in the audience of Saturday Night Live during its second season and hosted an episode during its third season."

Television completed in 1994, a few months before the murders. NBC had not yet decided whether to order the series when Simpson's arrest cancelled the project. While searching his home, the police obtained a videotaped copy of the pilot as well as the script and dailies. Although the prosecution investigated reports that Simpson, who played the leader of a group of former United States Navy SEALs, received \"a fair amount of\" military training\u2014including use of a knife\u2014for Frogmen, and there is a scene in which he holds a knife to the throat of a woman, this material was not introduced as evidence during the trial. NBC executive Warren Littlefield said in July 1994 that the network would probably never air the pilot if Simpson were convicted; if he were acquitted, however, one television journalist speculated that \"Frogmen would probably be on the air before the NBC peacock could unfurl its plume\". Most pilots that are two hours long are aired as TV movies whether or not they are ordered as series. Because\u2014as the Los Angeles Times later reported\u2014\"the appetite for all things O.J. appeared insatiable\" during the trial, Warner Bros. and NBC estimated that a gigantic, Super Bowl\u2013like television audience would have watched the Frogmen film. Co-star Evan Handler said the studio's decision not to air it or release it on home video, and forego an estimated $14\u00a0million in profits, was \"just about the only proof you have that there is some dignity in the advertising and television business\"."

He sings his own rap song, which includes the lyrics \"Don't you know there's no stopping the Juice / When I'm on the floor I'm like a lion on the loose / Better shoot me with a tranquilizer dart / Don't be stupid, I'm not a Simpson named Bart.\" In one episode, Simpson is at a used car lot in Las Vegas where he attempts to sell his white Bronco. A bullet hole in the front of the SUV is circled with his autograph, and he pitches it to a prospective buyer by saying that if they \"ever get into some trouble and have to get away, it has escapability.\" In another sketch called \"B-I-N-G-O.J.\", Simpson pretends to be having an affair with another man's girlfriend.

In high school he organized dances, hiring a band and ballroom and charging admission. Chuck Barnes helped Simpson form business relationships with Chevrolet and ABC early in his football career. By 1971, New York wrote that Simpson was already wealthy enough to \"retire this week if [he] wanted to\". In 1975, People magazine described Simpson as \"the first black athlete to become a bona fide lovable media superstar\". He used his amiable persona, good looks, and charisma in many endorsement deals. Beginning in 1975, he appeared in advertisements with the Hertz rental car company. Commercials depicted Simpson running through airports embodying speed, as others shouted to him the Hertz slogan \"Go, O.J., Go!\". Besides helping his acting career, Simpson estimated that the very successful \"superstar in rent-a-car\" campaign raised the recognition rate among people he met from 30% to 90%. Hertz's annual profit increased by 50% to $42.2 million within the first year, brand awareness increased by more than 40%, and 97% of viewers understood that the commercials advertised Hertz, avoiding the common \"vampire video\" problem. Simpson was so important to the company that CEO Frank Olson personally negotiated his contract, and Hertz used him for an unusually long time for a celebrity endorser. Advertising Age in 1977 named Simpson the magazine's Star Presenter of the Year; by 1984 consumer research found that he was the most popular athlete endorser, and a 1990s MCI Communications commercial starring Eunice Simpson satirized her son's work. Although Simpson appeared less often in Hertz commercials by the late 1980s, his relationship with the company continued; Simpson was to travel to Chicago to meet with Hertz executives and clients on the night of the Brown-Goldman murder. Other products Simpson endorsed included Pioneer Chicken, Honey Baked Ham, Calistoga Water Company's line of Napa Naturals soft drinks, and Dingo cowboy boots. As president and CEO of O. J. Simpson Enterprises he owned hotels and restaurants. When Simpson and Brown divorced in 1992 he had $10 million in assets and more than $1 million in annual income, including $550,000 from Hertz. During the June 1994 police chase, spectators shouted the \"Go, O.J., Go!\" slogan at Simpson as he rode in a white Bronco owned by Hertz."

TV stations interrupted coverage of the 1994 NBA Finals to broadcast the incident live. With an estimated audience of 95 million people, the event was described as \"the most famous ride on American shores since Paul Revere's\". The pursuit, arrest, and trial of Simpson were among the most widely publicized events in American history. The trial, often characterized as the Trial of the Century because of its international publicity, likened to that of Sacco and Vanzetti and the Lindbergh kidnapping, culminated after eleven months on October 3, 1995, when the jury rendered a verdict of \"not guilty\" for the two murders. An estimated 100 million people nationwide tuned in to watch or listen to the verdict announcement. Following Simpson's acquittal, no additional arrests or convictions related to the murders were made. Immediate reaction to the verdict was known for its division along racial lines: a poll of Los Angeles County residents showed that most African Americans there felt justice had been served by the \"not guilty\" verdict, while the majority of whites and Latinos opined that it had not. O. J. Simpson's integrated defense counsel team included Johnnie Cochran, Robert Kardashian, Robert Shapiro, and F. Lee Bailey. Marcia Clark was the lead prosecutor for the State of California. According to a 2016 poll, 83% of white Americans and 57% of black Americans believe Simpson committed the murders."

        "content": "Following Simpson's acquittal of criminal charges, Ron Goldman's family filed a civil lawsuit against Simpson. Daniel Petrocelli represented plaintiff Fred Goldman (Ronald Goldman's father), while Robert Baker represented Simpson. Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki presided, and he barred television and still cameras, radio equipment, and courtroom sketch artists from the courtroom. On October 23, 1996, opening statements were made, and on January 16, 1997, both sides rested their cases. On February 5, 1997, a civil jury in Santa Monica, California unanimously found Simpson liable for the wrongful death of and battery against Goldman, and battery against Brown. Simpson was ordered to pay $33,500,000 in damages. In February 1999, an auction of Simpson's Heisman Trophy and other belongings netted almost $500,000, which went to the Goldman family. The Goldman family also tried to collect Simpson's NFL $28,000 monthly pension, but failed to collect any money. In 1997, Simpson defaulted on his mortgage at the home in which he had lived for 20 years, at 360 North Rockingham Avenue, and the lender foreclosed the property. In July 1998, the house was demolished by its next owner, Kenneth Abdalla, an investment banker and president of the Jerry's Famous Deli chain. On September 5, 2006, Goldman's father took Simpson back to court to obtain control over Simpson's \"right to publicity\", for purposes of satisfying the judgment in the civil court case. On January 4, 2007, a federal judge issued a restraining order prohibiting Simpson from spending any advance he may have received on a canceled book deal and TV interview about the 1994 murders. The matter was dismissed before trial for lack of jurisdiction. On January 19, 2007, a California state judge issued an additional restraining order, ordering Simpson to restrict his spending to \"ordinary and necessary living expenses\". On March 13, 2007, a judge prevented Simpson from receiving any further compensation from the defunct book deal and TV interview, and the judge ordered the bundled book rights to be auctioned. In August 2007, a Florida bankruptcy court awarded the rights to the book to the Goldman family, to partially satisfy an unpaid civil judgment. Originally titled If I Did It, the book was renamed If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer, with the word \"If\" reduced in size to such an extent that it appears within the width of the large red \"I\" in the title, making the title appear to read I Did It: Confessions of the Killer. Additional material was added by members of the Goldman family, investigative journalist Dominick Dunne, and author Pablo Fenjves."

        "content": "The State of California claims Simpson owes $1.44\u00a0million in back taxes. A tax lien was filed in his case on September 1, 1999. In the late 1990s, Simpson attempted to register \"O. J. Simpson\", \"O. J.\", and \"The Juice\" as trademarks for \"a broad range of goods, including figurines, trading cards, sportswear, medallions, coins, and prepaid telephone cards\". A \"concerned citizen\", William B. Ritchie, sued to oppose the granting of federal registration on the grounds that doing so would be immoral and scandalous. Simpson gave up the effort in 2000 and left California that year for Florida, settling in Miami. Florida is one of few states where pensions and/or residences cannot generally be seized to collect debts. In February 2001, Simpson was arrested in Miami-Dade County, Florida, for simple battery and burglary of an occupied conveyance, for yanking the glasses off another motorist during a traffic dispute three months earlier. If convicted, Simpson could have faced up to 16 years in prison, but he was tried and quickly acquitted of both charges in October 2001. On December 4, 2001, Simpson's Miami home was searched by the FBI on suspicion of ecstasy possession and money laundering. The FBI had received a tip that Simpson was involved in a major drug trafficking ring after 10 other suspects were arrested in the case. Simpson's home was thoroughly searched for two hours, but no illegal drugs were discovered, and no arrest or formal charges were filed following the search. However, investigators uncovered equipment capable of stealing satellite television programming, which eventually led to Simpson's being sued in federal court. On July 4, 2002, Simpson was arrested in Miami-Dade County, Florida, for water speeding through a manatee protection zone and failing to comply with proper boating regulations. The misdemeanor boating regulation charge was dropped, and Simpson was fined for the speeding infraction. In March 2004, satellite television network DirecTV, Inc. accused Simpson in a Miami federal court of using illegal electronic devices to pirate its broadcast signals. The company later won a $25,000 judgment, and Simpson was ordered to pay an additional $33,678 in attorney's fees and costs."

        "content": "On the night of September 13, 2007, a group of men led by Simpson entered a room at the Palace Station hotel-casino and took sports memorabilia at gunpoint, which resulted in Simpson being questioned by police. Simpson admitted to taking the items, which he said had been stolen from him, but denied breaking into the hotel room; he also denied that he or anyone else carried a gun. He was released after questioning. Two days later, Simpson was arrested and initially held without bail. Along with three other men, Simpson was charged with multiple felony counts, including criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, assault, robbery, and using a deadly weapon. Bail was set at $125,000, with stipulations that Simpson have no contact with the co-defendants and that he surrender his passport. Simpson did not enter a plea. By the end of October 2007, all three of Simpson's co-defendants had plea-bargained with the prosecution in the Clark County, Nevada, court case. Walter Alexander and Charles H. Cashmore accepted plea agreements in exchange for reduced charges and their testimony against Simpson and three other co-defendants, including testimony that guns were used in the robbery. Co-defendant Michael McClinton told a Las Vegas judge that he too would plead guilty to reduced charges and testify against Simpson that guns were used in the robbery. After the hearings, the judge ordered that Simpson be tried for the robbery. On November 8, 2007, Simpson had a preliminary hearing to decide whether he would be tried for the charges. He was held over for trial on all 12 counts. Simpson pleaded not guilty on November 29, with an initial setting for trial on April 7, 2008, although it was soon set for September 8 to give the defense more time for their case. In January 2008, Simpson was taken into custody in Florida and was extradited to Las Vegas, where he was incarcerated at the Clark County jail for violating the terms of his bail by attempting to contact Clarence \"C. J.\" Stewart, a co-defendant in the trial. District Attorney David Roger of Clark County provided District Court Judge Jackie Glass with evidence that Simpson had violated his bail terms. A hearing took place on January 16, 2008. Glass raised Simpson's bail to US$250,000 and ordered that he remain in county jail until 15 percent was paid in cash. Simpson posted bond that evening and returned to Miami the next day. Simpson and his co-defendant were found guilty of all charges on October 3, 2008. On October 10, 2008, Simpson's counsel moved for a new trial (trial de novo) on grounds of judicial errors and insufficient evidence. Simpson's attorney announced he would appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court if Judge Glass denied the motion. The attorney for Simpson's co-defendant, C. J. Stewart, petitioned for a new trial, alleging Stewart should have been tried separately and cited possible misconduct by the jury foreman. Simpson faced a possible life sentence with parole on the kidnapping charge, and mandatory prison time for armed robbery. On December 5, 2008, Simpson was sentenced to a total of 33 years in prison, with the possibility of parole after nine years, in 2017. On September 4, 2009, the Nevada Supreme Court denied a request for bail during Simpson's appeal. In October 2010, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed his convictions. He served his sentence at the Lovelock Correctional Center where his inmate ID number was #1027820. A Nevada judge agreed on October 19, 2012, to \"reopen the armed robbery and kidnapping case against O. J. Simpson to determine if the former football star was so badly represented by his lawyers that he should be freed from prison and get another trial\". A hearing was held beginning May 13, 2013, to determine if Simpson was entitled to a new trial. On November 27, 2013, Judge Linda Bell denied Simpson's bid for a new trial on the robbery conviction. In her ruling, Bell wrote that all Simpson's contentions lacked merit."

At his parole hearing on July 20, 2017, the board decided to grant Simpson parole, with certain parole conditions such as travel restrictions, non-contact with co-defendants from the robbery, and not drinking excessively. He was released on October 1, 2017, having served almost nine years.

On 13 March 2008, in the campaign's UEFA Cup round-of-16 second leg against Bolton Wanderers, Pereirinha scored an 85th-minute goal that gave Sporting a 1\u20130 home victory and a spot in the quarter-finals. He had also netted in the previous round, to help beat hosts FC Basel 3\u20130. Pereirinha continued to be regularly used the following years, but almost exclusively from the bench. On 21 March 2009, in a rare start, he opened the score against Lisbon neighbours S.L.

He was one of the star players at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul as Zambia reached the quarter finals, trouncing Italy and Guatemala with 4\u20130 scorelines along the way. When a plane carrying the Zambian National team developed problems and plunged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Gabon on 28 April 1993 killing all 30 people on board including crew members and Football Association of Zambia president Michael Mwape, Musonda was traumatised as he was supposed to have been on the same plane. According to one report, he was called up by the national coach Godfrey Chitalu for the 1994 World Cup qualification match against Senegal but Anderlecht's team manager, Michel Verschueren, asked him to refuse the invitation and to play for Anderlecht, which Musonda did and therefore missed the fateful flight, though in an interview Musonda himself disclosed that when he first heard about the plane crash, he was in bed recovering from knee surgery and that was what saved his life. He would undergo seven operations on the same knee between 1991 and 1996. Musonda returned to Belgium and first worked as a youth coach at AA Ghent before moving  to Anderlecht to become a youth coach, scout and assistant trainer for the first team."

Rutledge spent most of his career as a back-up quarterback and a holder on kicks. He was a backup in Super Bowl XIV as a member of the Los Angeles Rams, he was a backup to Super Bowl MVP Phil Simms in Super Bowl XXI as a member of the New York Giants, and was a backup in Super Bowl XXVI as a member of the Washington Redskins. His most notable play with the Giants came in Super Bowl XXI in the third quarter. On fourth down with a yard needed, he was sent by head coach Bill Parcells for a potential decoy play. When the other team did not pick up on Rutledge, he took the snap and did a sneak up the middle for yardage that gave the Giants a first down that would eventually lead to a go-ahead score. His finest moment as a professional player came when as a member of the Redskins he came off the bench in a game versus the Detroit Lions in 1990.  Trailing 35-14 with 10:37 left in the third quarter Rutledge replaced an ineffective Stan Humphries and led a great comeback.  He completed 30 of 42 passes for 363 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 12 yards for the game-tying touchdown with only 24 seconds remaining.  In overtime, he hit Art Monk with a vital 40-yard pass on third and 15 to help set  up Chip Lohmiller's game-winning field goal. That game meant that Rutledge got the nod to start the following week on Monday Night against the Philadelphia Eagles in a game that was to become infamously known as the \"Body Bag Game\".  Rutledge, first, and then Stan Humphries were knocked out of the game, leaving emergency quarterback Brian Mitchell (a kick returner and former college quarterback) to finish the game.  Rutledge would never start an NFL game again but he did see spot duty in relief of returning starter Mark Rypien in the Redskins' 1991 Super Bowl Championship season, including some playing time in the last game of the regular season, again against the Philadelphia Eagles."

He had previously been released from the Bristol Rovers youth programme, but was re-signed at the age of 16. He made his first-team debut for Rovers on 21 January 2006, playing the last five minutes of a 2\u20131 win over Chester City at the Memorial Stadium. After two further substitute appearances in League Two, he made his first league start on 6 May, in a 3\u20132 home defeat to Macclesfield Town. After three appearances in the 2006\u201307 campaign, he featured in six matches from March onwards, and was an extra-time substitute for Lewis Haldane in the Football League Trophy final defeat to Doncaster Rovers at the Millennium Stadium. He was an unused substitute in the League Two play-off final, as Rovers won promotion with a 3\u20131 victory over Shrewsbury Town at Wembley. He became a first team regular under manager Paul Trollope in the 2007\u201308 season, playing 27 League One games and featuring in eight of the \"Gasheads\" nine FA Cup games en route to the quarter-finals. BBC reporter Nathan Mercer credited Lines with an \"excellent\" performance as Rovers beat Premier League side Fulham on penalties in the Third Round on 22 January, and Lines was fouled by Dejan Stefanovi\u0107 in an incident which saw the Serbian sent off. He scored his first goal in competitive football on 29 December, opening the scoring in a 3\u20130 home win over Carlisle United with a header. He played 48 games in the 2008\u201309 season, and missed only one league game due a suspension he picked up whilst celebrating an injury-time equaliser he scored against Swindon Town on 22 November. Lines was nominated for the League One Player of the Month award in November 2009 after scoring a goal in each of his three league games that month. He signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract with Rovers in January 2010, and was described by director of football Lennie Lawrence as \"a fundamental part of our plans to take this club forward.\" This came shortly after he was reported to be a transfer target for Southampton manager Alan Pardew. The transfer rumours continued despite the new contract. In total he scored ten goals in 46 appearances in the 2009\u201310 campaign. He was ruled out for two weeks with a toe injury in February 2011, but thanked manager Dave Penney after he made an immediate return to the first team. Despite this praise he publicly supported the board's decision to sack Penney the following month, and went on to praise the impact of caretaker-manager Stuart Campbell. Following Rovers' relegation to League Two at the end of the 2010\u201311 season, Lines spent seven days on trial at Championship side Crystal Palace. New Rovers boss Paul Buckle admitted that he was unlikely to keep Lines for the following season. He was still at the club though for the 2011\u201312 season opening victory over AFC Wimbledon at Kingsmeadow."

Robinson was in search of midfield options after Luke Chadwick and Stephen Gleeson both picked up injuries. He featured in 18 games for the MK Dons, including the 4\u20132 victory over Premier League side Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in the Fourth Round of the FA Cup.

He played in the 1\u20131 draw with Grimsby Town in the play-off final and converted the first penalty of the shoot-out, which Rovers won to regain their place in the English Football League. He was signed by Rovers manager Darrell Clarke on a permanent basis in June 2015, after his contract with Port Vale was cancelled by mutual consent. Lines made 36 appearances as Rovers won promotion with a third-place finish in 2015\u201316 and he would sign a new contract in June 2016. Lines scored his first goal since his full return to Bristol Rovers with a strike from  in a 1\u20130 victory over Cardiff City in the first round of the EFL Cup on 11 August 2016. The goal secured Rovers a trip to Stamford Bridge and a second round tie against Chelsea, which they ultimately lost 3\u20132. He scored his first league goal since his return in a late 2\u20131 comeback victory over Gillingham on 15 October as he embarked on a run from deep before calmly tucking the ball beyond opposition goalkeeper Jonathan Bond. His consistently good performances were rewarded with a new undisclosed-length contract in March 2017. Speaking as the oldest member of the squad at the age of 32 in September 2017, he admitted to becoming a vegetarian as he restricted his diet in an attempt to extend his playing career. On 2 April 2018, he was sent off during a 2\u20130 defeat at Fleetwood Town and was subsequently abused by some of the club's supporters on social media.

On 21 August 2018, he scored a 76th-minute penalty in a 2\u20131 home defeat to Portsmouth, only to get sent off two minutes later for a studs up challenge on Brett Pitman. However he lost his first team place after Graham Coughlan replaced Clarke as manager in December; the player and new manager would have a strained relationship, which led Lines to call Coughlan \"embarrassing\". On 8 May 2019, Lines was announced to be one of nine players who would be leaving the club at the end of their contract. Lines ended his second spell with his boyhood club having made over 350 appearances and having achieved three promotions during his two spells at the club."

Newton made an impact in his first season, where he set the rookie records for passing and rushing yards by a quarterback, winning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year in the process. The league's first rookie quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards in a season and the first to throw for 400 yards in his NFL debut, he also set the season record for quarterback rushing touchdowns.

        "content": "Newton initially attended the University of Florida, where he was a member of the Florida Gators football team in 2007 and 2008. As a freshman in 2007, Newton beat out fellow freshman quarterback John Brantley as the back-up for eventual Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow. He played in five games, passing for 40 yards on 5-of-10 and rushing 16 times for 103 yards and three touchdowns. In 2008, during his sophomore season, Newton played in the season opener against Hawaii but suffered an ankle injury and took a medical redshirt season. On November 21, 2008, Newton was arrested on felony charges of burglary, larceny, and obstruction of justice on an accusation that he stole a laptop computer from another University of Florida student. He was subsequently suspended from the team. Campus police \"tracked the stolen laptop to the athlete...Newton tossed the computer out his dorm window in a humorously ill-advised attempt to hide it from cops.\" All charges against Newton were dropped after he completed a court-approved pre-trial diversion program. \"I believe that a person should not be thought of as a bad person because of some senseless mistake that they made,\" said Newton in 2010. \"I think every person should have a second chance. If they blow that second chance, so be it for them.\" Newton announced his intention to transfer from Florida three days before the Gators' national championship win over Oklahoma. In November 2010, Thayer Evans of Fox Sports reported that Newton faced potential expulsion from the University of Florida for three instances of academic dishonesty, prior to transferring."

        "content": "Newton started the first game of Auburn University's 2010 season, a home win over Arkansas State on September 4, 2010. Newton accounted for 186 passing yards, 171 rushing yards, and  five total offensive touchdowns. He was named SEC Offensive Player of the Week following his performance in the 52\u201326 victory. Three weeks later, Newton had a second break-out game with 158 passing yards, 176 rushing yards, and five total touchdowns against the South Carolina Gamecocks in the 35\u201327 victory. On October 2, Newton led Auburn to a 52\u20133 victory over Louisiana-Monroe. He completed three touchdown passes, one of which went for 94 yards to Emory Blake. It was the longest touchdown pass and offensive play in Auburn football history. On October 9, Newton led Auburn to a 37\u201334 victory over Kentucky. He passed for 210 yards and rushed for 198 yards including four rushing touchdowns. On October 16, during the Arkansas game, Newton ran for 188 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns and threw one touchdown pass in the 65\u201343 victory. Following these performances, media reports began to list Newton among the top five candidates to watch for the Heisman Trophy. On October 23, Newton led Auburn to a 24\u201317 victory over the LSU Tigers. He rushed for 217 yards in the game, giving him 1,077 yards for the season, and set the SEC record for yards rushing in a season by a quarterback\u2014a record previously held by Auburn quarterback Jimmy Sidle that had stood for over 40 years. After this game, Newton became just the second quarterback to rush for over 1,000 yards in the conference's history. He also broke Pat Sullivan's school record for most touchdowns in a single season, a record that had stood since 1971, with 27. Both of these records were broken on the same play: a 49-yard touchdown run in which Newton escaped two tackles, corrected himself with his arm, eluded two additional tackles, and dragged a defender into the endzone for the touchdown. The play was described as Newton's \"Heisman moment\". Auburn received its first No. 1 overall BCS ranking, and Newton was listed as the overall favorite for the Heisman. By halftime of the game against rival Georgia, Newton became the first SEC player to ever throw for 2,000 yards and rush for 1,000 yards in a single season. With the 49\u201331 victory, Auburn extended its winning streak to 11\u20130 and clinched the SEC West, allowing them to play in the SEC Championship game. Newton led Auburn to a 28\u201327 victory over Alabama in the Iron Bowl after being down 24\u20130. The 24-point come-from-behind victory was the largest in the program's 117-year history. He passed for 216 yards with three passing touchdowns and ran for another. On December 4, 2010, Newton led the Tigers to an SEC Championship, their first since 2004, by defeating South Carolina 56\u201317, setting an SEC Championship Game record for most points scored and largest margin of victory. Newton was named the game MVP after scoring a career-best six total touchdowns, which were four passing and two rushing. With his performance, Newton also became the third player in NCAA FBS history to throw and run for 20-plus touchdowns in a single season joining former Florida teammate Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick, who reached the milestone earlier the same day. Newton was named the 2010 SEC Offensive Player of the Year as well as the 2010 AP Player of the Year. He was also one of four finalists for the 2010 Heisman Trophy, which he won in a landslide victory. Newton is the third Auburn player to win the Heisman Trophy (along with Pat Sullivan and Bo Jackson). Following the victory in the SEC Championship, Auburn was invited to participate in the school's first BCS National Championship Game. The game took place on January 10, 2011, in Glendale, Arizona, with Auburn playing against the Oregon Ducks. In a game that Steve Spurrier predicted to score as high as 60\u201355, Auburn beat Oregon just 22\u201319 to win the BCS National Championship. Newton threw for 262 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. He rushed 22 times for 65 yards, though he lost a fumble that later allowed Oregon to tie the game with limited time remaining. Once Auburn received the ball, Newton drove the Tigers down the field to win the game on Wes Byrum's last-second field goal. Media outlets wrote Newton was upstaged by teammate Michael Dyer, the game's Offensive MVP, and Auburn's defense, which held the high-powered Oregon ground game to just 75 yards On January 13, three days after winning the BCS National Championship, Newton declared for the 2011 NFL Draft, forgoing his senior season."

        "content": "Newton spent much of the second half of the 2010 football season embroiled in a controversy regarding allegations that his father, Cecil Newton, had sought substantial sums of money in return for his son playing for a major college football team, in violation of National Collegiate Athletic Association rules. In early November 2010, several Mississippi State University athletic boosters reported to the media that, during their recruitment of his son out of Blinn College nearly a year earlier, Cecil Newton said that it would take \"more than just a scholarship\" to secure his son's services. This demand was communicated by booster and former Mississippi State football player Kenny Rogers to fellow boosters and former teammates Bill Bell and John Bond. Rogers said in a Dallas radio interview that Cecil Newton said it would take \"anywhere between $100,000 and $180,000\" to get his son to transfer to Mississippi State. Auburn maintained throughout the investigation, which had begun several months before the public was made aware of it, that they were not involved in any pay-for-play scheme and that Cam Newton was fully eligible to play. On November 30, Auburn declared Cam Newton ineligible after the NCAA found evidence that Cecil Newton solicited Mississippi State $120,000 to $180,000 in exchange for Cam Newton's athletic service, a violation of amateurism. Auburn immediately filed to have him reinstated on the basis that Kenny Rogers could not be considered an agent and that Cam Newton was not aware of his father's illegal activity. The NCAA almost immediately sided with Auburn and reinstated Newton the next day on December 1, declaring him eligible for the 2010 SEC Championship Game three days later, stating that there was not sufficient evidence that Cam Newton or anyone from Auburn had any knowledge of Cecil Newton's actions. Auburn subsequently limited the access Cecil Newton had to the program as result of NCAA findings. Also, due to increased pressure by the media and the NCAA investigation, Cecil Newton announced he would not attend the Heisman Trophy Ceremony. The NCAA reinstatement did not clear Cecil Newton of any wrongdoing; it did, however, establish Cam Newton's eligibility as a candidate for the Heisman Trophy, which he won in a landslide victory with 2,263 points and 729 first-place votes. In October 2011, the NCAA officially closed its 13-month investigation into the recruitment of Cam Newton, unable to substantiate any allegation or speculation of illicit recruiting by Auburn, and concluded that Cecil Newton only solicited a cash payment from Mississippi State and no other institution attempting to recruit his son. The investigation, which consisted of over 50 interviews and the reviewing of numerous bank records, IRS documents, telephone records, and e-mail messages, resulted in no findings that would indicate Auburn participated in any pay-for-play scenario in signing Cam Newton. The NCAA said that the allegations failed to \"meet a burden of proof, which is a higher standard than rampant public speculation online and in the media\" and that the allegations were not \"based on credible and persuasive information\". The NCAA's Stacey Osburn said \"We've done all we can do. We've done all the interviews. We've looked into everything and there's nothing there. Unless something new comes to light that's credible and we need to look at, it's concluded.\""

On April 28, 2011, Newton was selected with the first overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers. He was the first reigning Heisman Trophy winner to go first overall since Carson Palmer in 2003. He also was Auburn's fourth No. 1 selection after Tucker Frederickson (1965), Bo Jackson (1986), and Aundray Bruce (1988). During the 2011 NFL lockout, he worked out for up to 12 hours a day at the IMG Madden Football Academy in Bradenton, Florida, spending up to two hours per day doing one-on-one training with fellow Heisman Trophy winner and ex-Panthers quarterback Chris Weinke. Before the draft, Panthers owner Jerry Richardson asked Newton to maintain his clean-cut appearance after Newton told Richardson he had no tattoos or piercings and was thinking about growing his hair longer. This gained some controversy on Richardson's part due to the fact that other players on the team didn't meet these guidelines. Dave Zirin, reporter for TheNation.com, even accused Richardson of racism. Despite this, Newton agreed to Richardson's requests and was drafted first overall. Newton would eventually start growing his hair out longer after Richardson sold the team to David Tepper."

        "content": "On July 29, 2011, Newton signed a four-year contract, worth over $22\u00a0million, with the Carolina Panthers that was fully guaranteed. After unsuccessfully negotiating with quarterback Jimmy Clausen for the No. 2 jersey Newton wore at Auburn, he decided to keep the No. 1 jersey that the Panthers had assigned him after the draft. His quarterbacks coach was Mike Shula, former head football coach of his college rival Alabama. A month later on September 1, 2011, he was named the Panthers' starting quarterback, ahead of Derek Anderson and Clausen. In his NFL debut game on September 11, 2011, Newton was 24\u201337 passing for 422 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception, in a 28\u201321 road loss to the Arizona Cardinals. With a quarterback rating of 110.4, he also rushed for a touchdown, and became the first rookie to throw for 400+ yards in his first career game. His 422 passing yards broke Peyton Manning's rookie record for most passing yards on opening day. In his second career game, a 30\u201323 home loss to the defending Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers, Newton broke his own record, set the weekend previously, with 432 yards passing, throwing and rushing for a touchdown. Newton's 854 passing yards through the first two games of the season, the most in league history by a rookie, broke the NFL record of 827 set by Kurt Warner in the 2000 season and stood as the most by any quarterback in the first two weeks of the season until New England's Tom Brady broke the mark again later in the day with 940. He also became the only player to begin his career with consecutive 400-yard passing games and broke the Carolina Panthers franchise record of 547 yards previously held by Steve Beuerlein. After Newton's second career game, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers commented, \"I think someone said in the locker room that I'm kind of glad we played him early in the season because when he figures it out fully, he's going to be even tougher to stop.\" Newton's three additional interceptions against the Packers tied him for the most interceptions thrown in the league. His total passing yards over the first three games was 1,012 yards. The Panthers recorded their first victory of the season against the Jacksonville Jaguars 16\u201310. Newton threw for 158 yards and one touchdown. The Panthers played the Atlanta Falcons, losing 31\u201317 while passing for 237 yards with no passing touchdowns. Newton increased his team's record to 2\u20135 with a Week 7 win over the Washington Redskins 33\u201320. He threw for 256 yards and one touchdown, completing 18 of his 23 passes. He also rushed for 59 yards and a touchdown, including one run for 25 yards. This performance brought Cam a passer rating of 127.5, his highest yet. With Carolina's win over the Indianapolis Colts, Newton became the fourth rookie quarterback to pass for over 3,000 yards in his first season, joining Peyton Manning, Matt Ryan, and Sam Bradford. Newton set the NFL rushing touchdown record for quarterbacks on December 4, 2011, rushing for his 13th touchdown of the season in the fourth quarter against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers breaking the record of Steve Grogan set in 1976. The historic performance was part of a career-high three rushing touchdowns, which were part of a 38\u201319 win. In that game, he also caught a 27-yard pass from wide receiver Legedu Naanee, making him a triple threat. On December 24, 2011, in a 48\u201316 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Newton threw for 171 yards and three touchdowns and also rushed for 65 yards and a touchdown. In the process, he broke Peyton Manning's record of 3,739 yards passing for a rookie. On January 1, 2012, against the New Orleans Saints, Newton threw for 158 yards and became the first rookie quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards. He finished his rookie season with 4,051 yards. Over the course of the season, when Newton had a turnover, the team was 0\u201310; when he had no turnovers, the team went 6\u20130. On January 22, 2012, Newton was named to be heading to the Pro Bowl after the New York Giants beat the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship. Because Eli Manning was one of the three quarterbacks for the NFC to be selected, and with Newton being picked as the NFC alternate later in December, Newton was able to play in the Pro Bowl with Manning headed to the Super Bowl. He finished the Pro Bowl with 186 yards along with two touchdowns and three interceptions. Newton was named both AP Offensive Rookie of the Year and Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year on February 4, 2012. He became the second straight number one pick to win the AP Rookie of the Year, after Sam Bradford won it the previous season. He was also the first Panther to win the Offensive award, but the second Panthers rookie of the year, following Julius Peppers, the AP Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2002. Cam received his Offensive Rookie of the Year, and Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year awards on the inaugural NFL Honors award show, with 47 of the 50 possible 50 AP votes (the other 3 going to Andy Dalton). He was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team, becoming the third Panthers quarterback to claim this award, joining Kerry Collins (1995) & Chris Weinke (2001). He also landed the number 5 and 2 play of the year with his 49-yard touchdown run against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5), and his touchdown fumblerooski to Richie Brockel vs. the Houston Texans. He has the nickname Superman due to his touchdown celebration. Newton was rated as the 40th best player in the NFL by his peers on the NFL Top 100 player list. His rookie season was when he started the Carolina Panther tradition \"Sunday Giveaway\", where the Panthers offensive players typically give away the football that they just scored a touchdown with to kids in the stands."

After helping lead the team to a 35\u201327 victory over New Orleans in Week 2, Newton and the Panthers went on a five-game losing streak. In the last game of the losing streak, Newton threw for a season-high 314 passing yards but had two interceptions in the 23\u201322 loss to the Chicago Bears. The Panthers went on to lose three of their next five games to sit at 3\u20139. At the end of that stretch was one of Newton's more efficient games of the season. Against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 13, he had 232 passing yards and three passing touchdowns to go along with 78 rushing yards in the 27\u201321 loss. In Week 14, a 30\u201320 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, he had a career-high 116 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown to go along with 287 passing yards and two passing touchdowns. The victory over the Falcons was the start of a four-game winning streak to end the season. However, the rough first half of the season was too much to overcome for the team. He finished his second professional season with 3,869 passing yards, 19 passing touchdowns, 12 interceptions, 741 rushing yards, and eight rushing touchdowns. The Panthers finished the season at 7\u20139. Though this season could be seen by some as a \"Sophomore Slump,\" he did improve in many statistical categories, improved on his efficiency, and cut back on his turnovers. Cam's noticeable decline in rushing touchdowns was due partially to the Panthers signing Mike Tolbert before the season began. Tolbert, a versatile fullback, recorded seven rushing touchdowns on the season. Newton  led the league in Yards Per Completion (13.8) and was tied for second with Peyton Manning in Yards Per Attempt (8.0) behind Robert Griffin III.

        "content": "On March 21, 2014, Newton underwent surgery to \"tighten\" up his ankle ligaments, which Newton admitted he had dealt with since his college days at Auburn University. The estimated recovery time was four months, which caused him to miss training camp and the first preseason game. During the third preseason game against the New England Patriots, Newton suffered a hairline fracture on his ribs after a hit from Jamie Collins. Newton's streak of starting 48 consecutive games was snapped during the Panthers opening game 20\u201314 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Newton made his debut during Carolina Panthers home opener against the Detroit Lions in Week 2. He recorded 300 yards of offense with a touchdown, no turnovers, and a 100.2 quarterback rating en route to a 24\u20137 victory. Through his first three starts in the season, Newton recorded a 110.8 quarterback rating against the blitz. During the Panthers Week 5 victory against the Chicago Bears, Newton led the Panthers from a 14-point deficit and was named to the Pro Football Focus (PFF) Team of the Week for his performance. Senior producer of NFL Films Greg Cosell and respected Football Outsiders columnist and Pre Snap Reads owner, Cian Fahey, both noted Newton's clear development and growth as a pocket passer. During the Panthers Week 6 37\u201337 tie against the Cincinnati Bengals, Newton accounted for 91% of the offense, recording a career-high 29 of 46 completions for 286 yards with two touchdowns and an interception along with 17 rushing attempts for 107 yards and a rushing touchdown, the most since the 2012 Week 14 win against Atlanta, when he had 116 on nine carries. Through the first six games in the season, Newton averaged 2.53 seconds to attempt a pass (2.73 in 2013) and has had the ball out in under 2.5 seconds on 51.8% of his drop-backs (40% in 2013). Newton had arguably his best game of the season in a 41\u201310 victory over the New Orleans Saints. Newton completed 21\u201333 passes for 226 yards and three touchdowns. Along with that he had 83 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown. He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his efforts in that game and with this performance, Newton has had four games with at least 200 passing yards and 80 rushing yards with multiple touchdown passes and a rushing touchdown. That is the most such games in NFL history. Two days following the Saints game, Newton was involved in a well-publicized car crash in which he fractured two vertebrae in his lower back. He missed only one game and returned to the field a week later in a match against the Cleveland Browns to make the final end-of-season push to win the NFC South division and once again make the playoffs. Newton led the Carolina Panthers to the first back-to-back division titles in the NFC South since the formation of the division and became the first quarterback since Michael Vick and Randall Cunningham as the only quarterbacks in NFL history with four seasons with at least 500 rushing yards. During the season, Newton also tied John Elway, Otto Graham, and Y. A. Tittle for 10th all time in rushing touchdowns by a quarterback with 33. Further, with his four victories in December, Newton ranked second in the NFL in December wins over the past four years with 14 only behind Tom Brady. Newton's 33 rushing touchdowns were the most by a quarterback in his first four seasons. He is also the only player in NFL history to have 10,000 passing yards and 2,000 rushing yards in his first four seasons and the first to have at least 3,000 passing yards and 500 rushing yards in four consecutive seasons. The following week, Newton led the Panthers to their first playoff win in nine years in the Wild Card Round over the Arizona Cardinals, throwing for 198 yards and two touchdowns while running for 35 yards. Newton and the Panthers were defeated by the Seattle Seahawks 31\u201317 in the Divisional Round. Newton was 23\u201336 for 245 yards with two touchdowns, two interceptions, and 37 rushing yards. Despite missing two games and dealing with ankle, rib, throwing hand, and back injuries through the entire season, Newton was rated as the 73rd best player in the NFL on the NFL Top 100 player list."

During the season-opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Newton finished with 175 yards passing, one touchdown, and one interception, while rushing for 35 yards. This was the first NFL opening-day victory for Newton (the Panthers won their opener in 2014 with an injured Newton on the sidelines). During the Panthers' Week 2 victory over the Houston Texans, Newton finished with 195 yards passing, two passing touchdowns, and one interception, while rushing for 76 yards and one touchdown. In week three against the New Orleans Saints, Newton passed for 315 yards and two passing touchdowns to go along with a rushing touchdown. It marked the 26th game in Newton's career in which he had a passing and a rushing touchdown, ranking second all-time in NFL history behind only Steve Young (31). Further, it marked the 14th time in his career where Newton notched two-plus touchdown passes and at least one rushing touchdown, third-most in the NFL since 1960, behind only Steve Young (17) and Fran Tarkenton (16). Through the first three games of the season, Newton accounted for 76% of the total offensive yards and 88% of the total touchdowns the Panthers generated. Newton helped lead the Panthers to a 3\u20130 start, the first time they had done so since the 2003 NFL Season. Several experts noted Newton's continued growth as a quarterback; Gil Brandt noted Newton's improving internal clock in the pocket, citing his career low sack percentage of 4.8% in the early season; senior NFL columnist for CBSSports.com, Pete Prisco, noting Cam's improved pocket patience, mechanics, and ability to read defenses; Cian Fahey noted Newton's development into a refined pocket passer with the athleticism to diversify any offense with a multidimensional run game. In the following week, during a 37\u201323 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Newton went 11 of 22 passing for 124 yards and two touchdowns while leading the team in rushing with 51 yards to give the Panthers a 4\u20130 record for the first time since 2003. As a rusher, through the first four weeks, Newton ranked 3rd in the NFL in rushes for first downs. Following a Week 4 bye, Newton threw for 269 yards, two interceptions, and a touchdown and rushed for 30 yards and a touchdown while leading the Panthers to victory against the Seattle Seahawks. It marked just the 3rd home Seahawks loss in the Russell Wilson era. It also marked the first franchise win in Seattle and Newton's ninth career fourth-quarter comeback win. During the game, Newton also recorded the 36th career rushing touchdown of his career; over that span, only Marshawn Lynch and Adrian Peterson were the only players to record more rushing touchdowns since 2011. Through the first five weeks of the season, Newton recorded a career-high 67.6% of passes under pressure. The following week against the Philadelphia Eagles, Newton led the Panthers to a victory, earning the Panthers their first 6\u20130 record in franchise history; during the game, he threw three interceptions and recorded his 28th game with a rushing touchdown and a passing touchdown. In Week 8, against the Indianapolis Colts, Newton threw for 248 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception, as the Panthers moved to 7\u20130 with a 29\u201326 overtime victory; with the win, Newton became the first quarterback in NFL history to earn a comeback victory with his team trailing in overtime. The following week, Newton led the Panthers to their first 8\u20130 start in franchise history with a 37\u201329 victory over the Green Bay Packers; Newton went 15\u201330 for 297 yards passing, three touchdowns, and one interception to go along with 9 rush, 57 yards, and one touchdown. Further, for the first time in his career, Newton threw for 200 yards and three touchdowns in a single half. For his game against the Packers, Newton was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week. The following week, during the Panthers 27\u201310 victory over the Tennessee Titans, Newton went 21 for 26 passes for 217 yards and 1 passing touchdown while recording 9 rushes for 23 yards and 1 rushing touchdown. Newton began the game with 11 straight completions, tying his career best in a single game (vs. Bucs on 11/18/12). The following week, Newton led the Panthers to a 44\u201316 victory over the Washington Redskins. During the game, Newton threw for a career-high five touchdown passes and became the only quarterback in NFL history with 100+ passing touchdowns and 25+ rushing touchdowns in his first five seasons. For his efforts, Newton was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for the second time this season. During the Panthers 33\u201314 victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving, Newton completed 16-of-27 passes for 183 yards, including going 8-of-16 on third downs, and rushed 12 times for 45 yards and a touchdown. During the Panthers 41\u201338 victory over the New Orleans Saints, Newton finished with 380 combined passing and rushing yards and five touchdown passes. He was 10 of 14 for 154 yards, two touchdowns and a 147 QB Rating under pressure. He also led the game-winning 75-yard touchdown drive to the Panthers undefeated through their first 12 games. For his performance, Newton was named NFC Offensive Player of the week for the third time in five weeks. The last time a player achieved that feat was 2007, when Tom Brady of the New England Patriots won three player of the week awards in five weeks while quarterbacking the New England Patriots during an undefeated regular season. The following week, during the Panthers 38\u20130 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, Newton completed 15 of 21 passes for 265 yards, 3 passing touchdowns, and finished with a career-high quarterback rating of 153.3. The Panthers amassed 225 yards of offense in just the first quarter of the game; a franchise record. During the Panthers' thrilling 38\u201335 victory against the New York Giants, Newton went 25 of 45 for 340 yards and 5 passing touchdowns while adding 8 rushes for 100 yards, his third career game with at least 100 rushing yards. Newton also led the Panthers on his 12th-ever game-winning drive, and his fourth of the season. For his efforts, Newton was again named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week. Newton became the NFL's first player to win the award four times in a seven-week span since San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006. Through the first 15 weeks of the NFL season, Newton led the Panthers to a 14\u20130 record. During that span, he also threw the second-most touchdown passes and led the NFL with 40 combined passing and rushing touchdowns. Newton was on the field for 660 of Carolina's 923 plays in which he was either the decision-maker or ball carrier after the snap, which accounted for 72 percent of the Panthers' total snaps. Further, Newton had the second-lowest percentage of passing yards gained after the catch among NFL quarterbacks and 40 of Carolina's 49 touchdowns this season were either thrown or run by Newton. The Panthers had their first setback in the 20\u201313 away loss to the Atlanta Falcons in their second divisional matchup. In the loss, Newton was 17 of 30 for 142 yards. In a 38\u201310 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the regular-season finale, Newton tied his season-best completion percentage (80.8), threw for almost 300 yards and added a pair of touchdowns and had his first game with two rushing touchdowns since Week 12 of the 2012 season. His passer rating of 139.3 was the second-best mark he posted all season. For his efforts, he was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for the fifth time in the season. Newton became the first player to win five NFC Offensive Player of the Week awards in a nine-week span within a season and his five awards tied for the most in a season in NFL history (Tom Brady, 2007). Cam Newton led NFL quarterbacks in rushing attempts, rushing yards, and rushing touchdowns in 2015. Newton's 45 total touchdowns during the regular season marked the most touchdowns by a single player since 2013. Newton was selected as the 2015 NFL MVP and Offensive Player of the Year by the PFWA. Newton and the Panthers finished the season with a 15\u20131 record, a franchise best, and earned a first-round bye in the playoffs. They defeated the Seattle Seahawks in the Divisional Round by a score of 31\u201324, despite nearly blowing a 31\u20130 lead, and went on to defeat the Arizona Cardinals 49\u201315 in the NFC Championship game to face the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50. In the NFC championship game, Newton completed 19 of 28 passes for 335 yards, with two touchdowns and one interception. He also rushed 10 times for 47 yards and two touchdowns. The Panthers' 49 points were the highest in NFC Championship history. On February 6, 2016, Newton was named NFL MVP. Newton was the second African-American quarterback to receive the honor after Steve McNair in 2003 and the first sole recipient as McNair shared his award with Peyton Manning. In Super Bowl 50 on February 7, 2016, which pitted the Panthers' top-ranked offense against the Denver Broncos' top-ranked defense, the Panthers lost by a score of 24\u201310. The game was generally a one-score affair until a few minutes left in the fourth quarter. The defense of both teams performed extremely well and led to both offenses struggling terribly throughout the game. Newton was sacked six times and Manning was sacked 5 times, both quarterbacks fumbled twice, and both threw an interception. Newton was ranked as the top player in the NFL by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016. For the season, Newton has sold the 7th most merchandise from March 2015 to February 2016."

        "content": "In the opening game of the 2016 season, in a Super Bowl 50 rematch against the Denver Broncos, Newton surpassed two of Steve Young's NFL records, one for the most career rushing touchdowns by a quarterback, with his 44th, and the other for most games with a passing and rushing touchdown, with his 32nd. This also tied Otto Graham's all-time professional American football mark of 44 rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. He passed for 194 yards, one passing touchdown, and one interception to go along with 11 carries for 54 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 21\u201320 loss. In the next game, a 46\u201327 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, he had 353 passing yards, four passing touchdowns, and one interception. On October 2, in a 48\u201333 loss at the Atlanta Falcons in Week 4, Newton suffered a concussion on a two-point conversion run and missed the rest of the game. Newton missed the next game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. On December 4, against the Seattle Seahawks, Newton was benched for the first offensive series for a dress code violation. It was Newton's first professional game, other than his first career preseason game in 2011, in which he began the game as the backup. For the 2016 season, Newton completed 52.9 percent of his passes, marking a career worst in that category. He threw 19 touchdown passes, 16 less than the previous year, and 14 interceptions, the second most of his career behind his rookie season. The Panthers regressed from their 15\u20131 record from the previous year to a 6\u201310 record in 2016. Despite a down 2016 season, Newton was still ranked 44th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017."

        "content": "On March 30, Newton had surgery to repair a partially torn rotator cuff on his throwing shoulder. During a press conference on October 4, Newton was asked a question by Jourdan Rodrigue, a female sportswriter for The Charlotte Observer, regarding passing routes. Newton smirked and said, \"It's funny to hear a female talk about routes.\" Then he answered her question. His remarks were viewed as sexist by Rodrigue as well as many in the media. It later surfaced that Rodrigue had previously mocked Newton using a Twitter account with which she had also posted racist comments, causing the publication BlackSportsOnline.com to label her a hypocrite. The following day, yogurt company Dannon dropped Newton as a sponsor. Newton uploaded a video to Twitter later that day in which he apologized for his remarks. During Monday Night Football against the Miami Dolphins in Week 10, Newton threw for 254 yards and rushed for 95 yards with four total touchdowns. The Panthers combined for 294 rushing yards and 548 total yards of offense as the Panthers won 45\u201321. His performance in Week 10 earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week. He finished the regular season with 3,302 passing yards, 22 touchdowns, 16 interceptions and a career-high 754 rushing yards to go along with six rushing touchdowns. The Panthers made the playoffs as the #5-seed. In the Wild Card Round against the New Orleans Saints, he was 24 of 40 for 349 yards and two touchdowns as the Panthers lost by a score of 31\u201326. Newton was ranked 25th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018."

The next week, he passed for two touchdowns and ran for two touchdowns in the 31\u201321 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. In Week 7 against the Philadelphia Eagles, after being down 17\u20130 in the fourth quarter, Newton completed 16 of 22 passes for 201 yards and two touchdowns in the final quarter as the Panthers defeated the Eagles 21\u201317, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week. Newton and the Panthers began struggling in the month of November. After the Panthers lost to the New Orleans Saints in Week 15, which was their sixth straight loss after starting 6\u20132, Newton acknowledged a nagging shoulder injury that had been hampering his play during the losing streak, and hinted that the team would deactivate him for the final two games of the season in order to heal. On January 24, 2019, Newton officially underwent right shoulder surgery. In a poll orchestrated by writers from The Athletic, Newton was voted the most underrated quarterback in the league by 85 defensive players from 25 teams. He was ranked 87th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019. Newton made his return from injury in Week 1 of the following season against the Los Angeles Rams. In the game, Newton passed for 239 yards and one interception as the Panthers lost 30\u201327. In Week 2 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday Night Football, Newton completed 25 passes out of 51 attempts for 333 yards as the Panthers lost 20\u201314.  After the game, Newton said \"All fingers are pointed back to the offense and me specifically.\" Newton was held out of the week 3 game against the Arizona Cardinals due to injury, and it was later revealed that he had a Lisfranc fracture, which he later confirmed in a YouTube vlog. On November 5, the Panthers placed Newton on injured reserve as the injury was healing slower than expected. On March 17, 2020, the Panthers announced they had given Newton permission to seek a trade. However, on March 24, after failing to find a trade partner, the team announced they had officially released Newton."

        "title": "Cam Newton_New England Patriots",
        "content": "After nearly three months in free agency, Newton signed a one-year deal with the New England Patriots on July 8, 2020. The contract included a base salary of $1.05 million, the minimum salary for a player with his amount of experience, and a maximum value of $7.5 million, including incentives and playing time bonuses. Newton was considered by the media as a potential successor to 20-year veteran Tom Brady, who left New England in free agency. He was named starting quarterback and team captain of the Patriots on September 3, beating out veteran Brian Hoyer and second-year Jarrett Stidham, which made him the team's first new primary starter since 2002. In his first career start with the Patriots, a Week 1 game at home against the Miami Dolphins, Newton led the team to a 21\u201311 victory, completing 15 of 19 passes for 155 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions while carrying the ball 15 times for 75 yards and two rushing touchdowns. After the game ended, Newton was involved in a scuffle with Dolphins defensive lineman Christian Wilkins and nose tackle Raekwon Davis, the latter of which attempted to remove a chain from Newton's neck. During Week 2 against the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday Night Football, Newton finished with 397 passing yards, 47 rushing yards, one passing touchdown, an interception, and two rushing touchdowns. At the end of the game, with the Patriots trailing 35\u201330, Newton attempted to run into the end zone from the one-yard line, but was stopped short, resulting in a Patriots loss. On October 3, 2020, a day before the team's Week 4 matchup against the Chiefs, Newton tested positive for COVID-19 and the team placed him on the reserve/COVID-19 list, which ultimately postponed the game by one day. He was activated from the list on October 14. In Week 9, in a 30\u201327 victory over the New York Jets on Monday Night Football, Newton passed for 274 yards and had two rushing touchdowns. The performance marked the third time in the 2020 season that Newton had rushed for two touchdowns in one game, matching his career-high of three such games in his rookie season in 2011. In Week 11 against the Houston Texans, Newton threw for 365 yards and a touchdown during the 27\u201320 loss. In Week 12 against the Arizona Cardinals, Newton threw for a season low 84 yards and two interceptions during the 20\u201317 win. In Week 13 against the Los Angeles Chargers, Newton only threw for 69 yards and a touchdown, but rushed for 48 yards and two more touchdowns during the 45\u20130 win. In Week 16 against the Buffalo Bills on Monday Night Football, Newton threw for 34 yards and rushed for 24 yards and a touchdown before being benched in favor of Jarrett Stidham in the third quarter during the 38\u20139 loss. In Week 17, against the New York Jets, he had 242 passing yards and three touchdowns to go along with his first career touchdown reception on a trick play where Jakobi Meyers threw to him during the 28\u201314 win. Newton finished the season with a league-high 12 quarterback rushing touchdowns, the second-highest in a season behind his 14 in 2011. However, Newton also threw for 2,657 yards and eight touchdowns, which were the lowest outside of his injury-shortened 2019 campaign. On March 12, 2021, the Patriots re-signed Newton to a one-year deal worth up to $13.6 million. In training camp, he competed with rookie first-round draft pick Mac Jones. On August 21, he traveled to an appointment outside of the New England area. Despite multiple negative tests for COVID-19, he was required to stay away from the team facility for five days. This caused him to miss four days of practice prior to their preseason game. He did, however, participate virtually in the practices. He was able to return to the team in time for their final preseason game, which he did play in. On August 31, Newton was released from the Patriots during final roster cuts."

        "content": "On November 11, 2021, Newton signed a one-year deal worth up to $10 million to return to the Carolina Panthers, following an injury to starting quarterback Sam Darnold. The deal includes $4.5 million that is fully guaranteed and a $1.5 million roster bonus. In his first game after re-signing, Newton received limited playing action as the backup to P. J. Walker in the Week 10 game against the Arizona Cardinals but made an immediate impact, scoring touchdowns on his first two plays of the game. The first-quarter touchdowns came by way of a two-yard run and a two-yard pass to Robby Anderson, respectively, and helped the Panthers to a 34\u201310 win. In his return to Carolina the following week, he was named the starter and scored two passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown in a 27\u201321 loss to the Washington Football Team. Newton remained the starter for the Week 12 loss to the Miami Dolphins, but was benched in the fourth quarter for Walker after completing 5 of 21 passes for 92 yards, two interceptions, and a 5.8 passer rating. His 23.8 completion percentage was the lowest for a quarterback with at least 20 attempts since Joey Harrington completed 22.7 percent of his passes in 2004.  In a week 14 game against the Falcons, Newton was again named the starter, but split significant playing time with P.J. Walker, ending the game with a team-leading 47 yards rushing and a rushing touchdown, but also having thrown a interception in a 29-21 loss. Newton played in eight games, starting five, throwing for 684 yards, four touchdowns, five interceptions, rushed for 230 yards, and five rushing touchdowns."

An ever-present in the 1991\u201392 season, along with fellow full-back Andy Thackeray, he played in the club's giant-killing of Arsenal in the FA Cup Third Round. They were eventually defeated by West Ham United in the next round, following a replay. For his performances, Hardy was named on the PFA Team of the Year. Following the creation of the Premier League, Wrexham spent the 1992\u201393 season in the Third Division. A second-place finish then won the club promotion into the Second Division. The \"Red Dragons\" held their own in the third tier, and remained in the division for the rest of Hardy's time at the club. He captained the side in the 1995 Welsh Cup Final victory over Cardiff City, in his second appearance in a cup final. Wrexham equalled a club record by reaching the FA Cup quarter-finals in 1996\u201397, beating Colwyn Bay, Scunthorpe United, West Ham United, Peterborough United and Birmingham City on the way. Drawn against Chesterfield, also of the Third Division, a 1\u20130 defeat at Saltergate prevented the club from making a first-ever appearance in the FA Cup semi-finals. However Hardy was limited to just sixteen appearances throughout the 1996\u201397 season. He posted 39 appearances in 1997\u201398, picking up seven yellow cards.

He departed the club at the end of the campaign. Despite being granted a testimonial match for serving the club for more than ten years and playing over 450 games (in all competitions), financial problems from the 2001 season onwards meant that he never received the game. In June 2001 he signed with Brian Horton's Port Vale. He scored on his league debut for the \"Valiants\" on 25 August, helping Vale to beat Peterborough United 4\u20131 at Vale Park. However, he was out of the first team picture by October, and was transfer listed in November. Chester City expressed interest in signing him on loan the following month. He joined Luton Town on trial in January 2002, but manager Joe Kinnear decided that Hardy was too small for the Third Division. With ten appearances to his name in 2001\u201302, he left Vale in April 2002. In November that year had a trial with Mansfield Town.

He won the First Division championship with the Perth club in 1996-97 before leaving McDiarmid Park in 1998 to return to England with Wigan Athletic. His stay at Springfield Park was short, and he left again for Scotland later the same year to sign for Hearts.

He played professionally for thirteen seasons, twelve seasons with the New York Jets and one season with the Philadelphia Eagles. Ryan was primarily a backup, seeing just fifteen snaps in his first four years. His one significant season was in 1984, when he started eleven games for the Jets. He went 6-5 while throwing fourteen touchdowns and interceptions for 1,939 yards. During the 1986-87 NFL playoffs, Ryan was the starting quarterback for the Jets against the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Round. Throwing three touchdown passes in the game, the Jets won 35-15 for their first playoff win in four years. The following week during the Divisional Round against the Cleveland Browns, Ryan threw a 42-yard touchdown on a flea-flicker to give the Jets a 7-0 1st quarter lead. However, he suffered an injury that knocked him out in the second quarter (leading to the return of Ken O'Brien, who had started the regular season as quarterback), and the Jets would ultimately lose this game 23-20 in double overtime, the third longest playoff game in NFL history at that time."

        "content": "A college standout at the University of Alabama, McCants had a number of accolades bestowed upon him including being named a 1989 Unanimous First Team All-American (AP, UPI, WCFF, AFCA, FWAA, FN, TSN) and a 1989 Butkus Award Runner-up.  He was a member of the 1990 Sugar Bowl team and was named the National Defensive Player of the Year in 1989 by CBS. In 1988 as a sophomore, McCants finished second on the team with 78 tackles, second only to Derrick Thomas.  Additionally, McCants recorded the most tackles on the team four times during the 1988 regular season, against Tennessee (8), Mississippi State (14), Auburn (17), and Texas A&M (11). The Texas A&M game, dubbed the Hurricane Bowl, was originally to take place September 17, but Alabama head coach Bill Curry refused to travel to College Station due to the threat posed by Hurricane Gilbert. The Tide ended the season with a win against Army in the 1988 Sun Bowl, in which McCants had a game-high 13 tackles. In 1989, he led the Crimson Tide with 119 tackles and 4 sacks.  After Alabama's victory against Tennessee, McCants was named the SEC Defensive Player of the Week by the league office for his 16 tackles and two sacks.  Three weeks later, he was named Sports Illustrated defensive player of the week after totaling 18 tackles in an Alabama victory over LSU. In the last game of the 1989 regular season against Auburn, dubbed the Iron Bowl, McCants was named the CBS Player of the Game for Alabama with 18 tackles, an interception, and a forced fumble.  A high point for the Tide from the game was McCants' display of \"incredible athletic talent\" in running down Auburn receiver Shane Wasden from behind and preventing a touchdown. Additionally, it was the second straight Iron Bowl in which McCants led the Tide in tackles, combining for 35 total between the 1988 and 1989 matchups. Even with the loss to Auburn, Alabama would still claim the title of 1989 SEC Champions, the school\u2019s first conference title since 1981. Among a number of individual honors, McCants finished his college career with 197 total tackles, including 16 tackles for a loss.  Additionally, McCants 119 tackles that year puts him tied for 6th all time for tackles in a single season by an Alabama player. The February 12, 1990 issue of Sports Illustrated ran an article that focused on McCants titled \"The Young and the Restless\", that profiled his and other college juniors' eventually successful attempts to declare for the NFL Draft before their senior season, a then-uncommon practice.  In December 2010, Bleacher Report named McCants the 33rd greatest player in Alabama Crimson Tide History. Before the draft, Ed Sherman of the Chicago Tribune described McCants as \"the biggest star around\", with pro scouts \"drooling over him\", and projected him to be \"a virtual lock to be the top pick in next spring`s NFL draft\". `BAMA STAR WEIGHS THE PROS, CONS"

        "content": "McCants was for a time expected to be the first player selected in the 1990 NFL draft, but the Atlanta Falcons backed off due to rumors of knee trouble and allegations that his family had been paid money by a sports agent while he was still in college. Still, McCants' strength and 4.51 second time in the 40-yard dash guaranteed he would still be a high pick, if not #1. After being drafted fourth overall by the Buccaneers in 1990, McCants signed a 5-year, $7.4 million deal with the team, including a then-record $2.5 million cash signing bonus.  A highly touted prospect, McCants rookie card by Score quoted former Kentucky head coach Jerry Claiborne as saying \"Keith is one of the best football players I have ever seen.  Have you ever seen a linebacker as big as he is? I never have.  He looks like an elephant and he runs like a deer\". Buccaneers coach Ray Perkins said that \"He plays like he is never out of the play. That is an intensity level I like\". Floyd Peters was brought to the Bucs in 1991, and converted McCants from a linebacker to defensive end. Although McCants resisted the change, Peters convinced him that with time he could become a success story along the lines of Chris Doleman, another Peters conversion. Although privately unhappy he accepted the position, and tried to make the best of it, claiming \"Teams won't take me lightly. I can tell you that...I can play any position on this football team, except maybe quarterback. When this season is over, I could be in the Pro Bowl. You don't know how hungry I am. It doesn't matter what position I'm playing. What matters is me.\" Although McCants was not fond of the move, he did have some success, as he led the Buccaneers in 1991 with 34 quarterback pressures and recorded 5 sacks, prompting Patrick Zier of the New York Times to remark \"considering the circumstances, McCants first year was a success. . .despite having to learn an entirely new position\". In December 1991, Coach Peters told the media \"I think he's played a decent season.  If you watch films, Keith is a producer.\"  McCants continued to build upon his experience and was second on the Buccaneers in sacks (5) and quarterback pressures (21) in 1992. Eventually, Tampa Bay cut him during their 1993 training camp. Within 48 hours, he was picked up off waivers by the New England Patriots, where he was reunited once again with Ray Perkins, then New England's Offensive Coordinator.  Regarding his cut from the Bucs and resigning, McCants remarked at the time \"This is a lot off my shoulders...The rumors had been spreading for some time now concerning my future with Tampa.\" He played in a preseason game the day he was signed, against the Kansas City Chiefs, before being released. In 1993 while with the Houston Oilers, McCants stepped in to separate Buddy Ryan and Kevin Gilbride when Ryan punched Gilbride in the face following an Oilers fumble.  That season, the Oilers would go on to finish first in the AFC Central Division, sending them to their seventh straight postseason, and McCants's first.  When asked what it meant to go to the playoffs, McCants replied, \"Let me tell you something, this is big-time. This is football\u00a0... I haven't had a winning season since I left college, and it feels great to win again.\"  In 1994, McCants went to the Cardinals, following Buddy Ryan to Arizona after he was named head coach.  In a game against the Chicago Bears, McCants picked off Steve Walsh and ran back a 46-yard touchdown; it was the Cardinals' longest interception return of the season.  In 1995 McCants scored his second NFL touchdown, on a fumble recovery against the Seattle Seahawks."

In the 1996-97 season Link\u00f6pings HC was coached by Tommy Boustedt, and when his contract ended and he signed with the Elitserien team V\u00e4stra Fr\u00f6lunda HC, he brought Johansson with him.

He soon earned himself a move to Blackburn Rovers, becoming one of Kenny Dalglish's first signings but after a year with the Rovers he was transferred to Plymouth Argyle in 1993. In 1995 Premiership newcomers Bolton Wanderers signed Burnett. But after only a season with the club he was sold to Huddersfield Town following a short loan spell. His time in Yorkshire was a rather mixed one. He alternated between a deep-lying creative midfield role and that of a libero-style sweeper. Described as a flair player with much skill, he scored a wonder goal against Bradford City from just inside his own half in a League Cup tie, which proved to be his only goal for Huddersfield. At the time of his goal, the tie was balanced at 2\u20132 on aggregate. Burnett's goal in the 77th minute put Huddersfield through to the next round. Following a clear out at Huddersfield, Burnett was loaned to Grimsby Town in 1998 and scored in his debut against Scunthorpe United as the Mariners put their local rivals out of the Football League Trophy. It was in the same competition at Wembley Stadium against AFC Bournemouth that Burnett scored the winning golden goal in the 1998 final and played in the promotion winning team in the play-off final a month later. Burnett helped the Mariners to an impressive finish in the Championship, almost securing a play-off spot to the Premiership the following season. He stayed with Grimsby until the summer of 2002, but was troubled by a persistent injury problem that made him miss chunks of the 1999\u20132000, 2000\u201301 and 2001\u201302 seasons. Burnett was released by manager Paul Groves with the player sidelined for the majority of his time in his last season. Burnett dropped out of professional football and signed with Conference National club Woking, but his time at his new club was short lived after a spat with the club's supporters. The incident happened in a Conference game in which Woking were trailing 2\u20130 with 20 minutes remaining. Burnett was brought on as a substitute but could not change the outcome of the game. In a statement made to the Grimsby Telegraph, Burnett claimed that Woking supporters had singled him out for abuse, stating that they expected him to come on and win the game for them because he was a professional footballer. Burnett claimed that just because he is a professional does not mean he can change the outcome of every game. He then joined Grays Athletic and Fisher Athletic for a short period of time before appearing to retire from the sport. In 2004 Burnett made a return to the professional game signing for Peterborough United on a non-contract basis. He did not make any appearances for the club before leaving."

With Blackburn, he went on to win the U17 Premier League and reach the FA Youth Cup final, playing in front of a 25,000-strong crowd against an Everton team featuring future Premiership footballers Leon Osman, Francis Jeffers, Richard Dunne and Michael Ball. Baldacchino went on to become a reserve team regular in forthcoming seasons and was rewarded with a four-year professional contract, but was transferred to Blackburn's local rivals Bolton Wanderers in March 2000 as comparisons to his former Blackburn teammates Damien Duff and David Dunn were made by his new manager Sam Allardyce and assistant manager Phil Brown. He was awarded squad number 33. With pace to burn and accurate crossing ability Baldacchino soon showed his potential in Bolton's reserve side and in pre-season games for the first team. However, the signings of Jay-Jay Okocha and Youri Djorkaeff hindered his chances of making a first-team breakthrough and he left Bolton after only 18 months, signing with Carlisle United on a three-year deal. Baldacchino was an instant hit with the club with an outstanding display of pace and trickery to help defeat Southend United away in his first match. Baldacchino was a regular for Carlisle before being prised away by Brooks Mileson and the spending power of Scottish club Gretna. Gretna, with their newfound wealth, won Scottish Third, Second and First Division titles in consecutive seasons, with Baldacchino one of the club's star players; he and Gretna teammates Kenny Deuchar, Gavin Skelton and Chris Innes gained the prestigious accolade of being the only four players in 100 years of Scottish football history to play in all Scottish football divisions with the same team. Baldacchino's time with Gretna saw him win countless man of the match award, the goal of the season award and even score a goal in the UEFA Europa League. An impressive display against Dunfermline Athletic in the Scottish Cup in front of then-Celtic manager Gordon Strachan earned Baldacchino rave reviews, Hibs, Motherwell and Celtic all had regular checks on Baldacchino. Brooks Mileson once again showed his spending power and ambition by keeping hold of Baldacchino and he signed a new improved four-year deal in December 2005 making him one of the club's top earners. Gretna arrived in style to the SPL breaking all records on their way and many players staying loyal to Gretna turning away potential big money moves on the way. The season 2007\u201308 was to be Gretna's last year as a club as they bowed out at the top when owner Brooks Mileson took ill in late February. Baldacchino was given squad number 7 and played against Rangers and Celtic that season as Gretna struggled to cope with life in the top flight. They were relegated at the end of the season. Baldacchino transferred to VPL club Altona Magic in May 2008 and one year later he signed for New South Wales Premier League outfit Bonnyrigg White Eagles. Before moving to Forest Hill Milford United on a free transfer, and Hume City also a free transfer. He claims that he currently wants to play in the Maltese Premier League and wants to represent Malta."

He impressed in a home match for Boston Town against Royal Arsenal on Good Friday in 1889, and Arsenal then arranged a job for him at the Royal Arsenal factory so that he could play for their team. He played in Arsenal's very first FA Cup tie, against Lyndhurst on 5 October 1889, and soon earned a reputation as a determined  and tough-tackling wing-half. He became club captain in 1890, and was still captain when Arsenal turned professional in 1891. However, he was replaced as Arsenal captain in October 1891 by new arrival Sandy Robertson (who had previously played for Preston North End's 1888\u201389 Double-winning side), and although assured of a place in the first team, he decided to step down to the reserves.  In total, he played 4 FA Cup ties and 71 other senior matches for Woolwich Arsenal. In the summer of 1892, he moved to Luton Town, to become the club's captain and coach. After two years at Luton, he joined Tottenham Hotspur (thus making him the first person to play for both Spurs and Arsenal, albeit long before the latter moved to north London in 1913), and played in Spurs' very first FA Cup tie, a first qualifying match against West Hertfordshire, on 13 October 1894; Spurs won 3\u20132. He left Tottenham in 1895, to play for  Dartford, before finishing his career at Shepherd's Bush. He later opened a sports shop in Plumstead and became the first British ladies team coach in 1895. Julian remained loyal to Woolwich Arsenal, going back to work for the club during the Boer War. Julian retained his footballing ties after retiring from playing, and in 1909 he moved to the Netherlands to coach there, later followed by his sons Bill and Harry, who both coached a number of teams in the Netherlands. Julian acted as head coach of HFC from 1909 until 1912. He stayed with HFC but from then on, he was assistant-coach / groundsman / caretaker, before he returned to England in 1915 to live in Enfield, London. He was one of the longest-surviving members of Arsenal's first professional side, along with Gavin Crawford and Jack McBean. The three were reunited at an Arsenal game against Chelsea on 20 March 1948 (by which time Arsenal were one of the leading sides in English football), an event recorded in The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal. He lived until the age of 89, dying in Enfield in 1957, outliving both Crawford and McBean to make him the last surviving member of Arsenal's first professional team."

He ended the 2007\u201308 regular season in Sweden as the leading goaltender in save percentage and goals against average. On 31 May 2008, Enroth signed a three-year level entry contract with the Buffalo Sabres in the NHL. He also was the top European goaltender in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft.

In 2012, he returned to Leeds for a short loan spell. Delph had a successful start to the 2012\u201313 Premier League season, leading Villa manager Paul Lambert to call for his inclusion in the England squad. In July 2015, Delph joined Manchester City for \u00a38\u00a0million.

        "content": "Born in Bradford, West Yorkshire, Delph started his career in football as a youngster at Bradford City. Delph left City in September 2001 to join Leeds United after he was recommended to their academy coach Greg Abbott by former Bradford manager Paul Jewell, whose son played with Delph. He went to Tong Secondary School, which he left in 2006 to sign a two-year scholarship with Leeds United, at the age of 16. He completed his studies at the partner school to Leeds, Boston Spa School. After a string of impressive performances in spring 2007, Delph was made captain of the Leeds Reserves. He was given his debut at Leeds as a substitute in the final match of the 2006\u201307 season against Derby County on 6 May 2007, a match in which Robert Bayly was also given a debut for Leeds. He was awarded his first professional contract on 11 January 2008, and made two appearances for Leeds in the 2007\u201308 season, both as a substitute. Delph impressed in the 2008\u201309 pre-season friendly against Barnet, earning praise from both manager Gary McAllister and former Leeds player Eddie Gray. He made his first League Cup start in Leeds' 5\u20132 win away at Chester City in the first round on 13 August 2008. Having gained more first-team experience, on 5 September 2008, Delph signed a new four-year contract at Leeds. He celebrated his new contract by scoring his first senior goal the following day as Leeds defeated Crewe Alexandra 5\u20132. He soon followed it up by scoring twice, both \"superb goals\" from long range, against Walsall during a 3\u20130 win. Delph's form attracted the attention of Premier League managers, with Arsenal's Ars\u00e8ne Wenger reported to be lining up a \u00a36\u00a0million bid for the midfielder, and Newcastle United having a bid rejected by Leeds chairman Ken Bates. His performances also prompted Stuart Pearce to give Delph his first call-up to the England under-21 squad in November 2008. He was a late substitute for Craig Gardner as England defeated Czech Republic to win his first under-21 cap on 18 November. During the January 2009 transfer window, Leeds rejected another two bids from Premier League for Delph, with Bates saying: \"We explained to both clubs that we don't deal in petty cash.\" The following day he scored a \"goal of genuine quality\" against Brighton & Hove Albion by finding the top corner of the goal with a curling shot following a long run. Manager Simon Grayson said: \"If he scores goals like that, his value is going to go up. It certainly won't go down.\" Despite the attention of Premier League managers, Delph remained with Leeds as the January transfer window closed. By March 2009, his performances during the 2008\u201309 season earned Delph a nomination for the League One player of the year, which was won by Leicester City's Matty Fryatt, and helped him to win the young player of the year in the end of season Football League Awards. The awards for the 2008\u201309 season did not end there, with Delph winning young player of the season, goal of the season, for his strike against Brighton and player's player of the season at the club awards. After Leeds lost out in the playoff semi-finals against Millwall, there was much speculation about Delph's future at Leeds, however he did manage to play in Leeds' early pre-season matches, before ultimately Leeds turned down offers from other clubs and Delph completed his move to Aston Villa."

It was later revealed on 19 April 2010 that Delph had suffered a cruciate ligament injury, set to keep him out of action for up to eight months. Delph returned to action on 26 February 2011, in a Premier League victory over Blackburn Rovers, when he came on as an impromptu left-back after Nathan Baker was injured in the first half. On 3 March 2011, Delph signed a new deal with Aston Villa keeping him at the club until 2015. He scored his second goal for Villa against Tranmere Rovers in the League Cup on 28 August 2012. On 20 January 2012, Delph re-signed for Leeds United on loan, initially until 25 February 2012. He made his second Leeds United debut against Ipswich Town on 21 January. Delph picked up an ankle injury in Leeds' defeat to Coventry City and returned to Aston Villa for treatment on the injury. It was revealed that Delph would miss the end of the season, so his loan at Leeds was not renewed and he returned to his parent club. During the 2012\u201313 Premier League season, Delph established himself as a regular in Paul Lambert's team, finishing the season with 24 appearances. In the later half of the season, Fabian put in some good performances and began to show a good partnership with Ashley Westwood and Yacouba Sylla in the centre of midfield."

He saw a long range, low driven shot from his favoured left foot hit the inside of Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny's left post, coming very close to his first Premier League goal. His good form continued four days later in a controversial 2\u20131 loss against Chelsea, and again the following weekend in a 1\u20130 loss against Liverpool. His first goal of the season came in a 3\u20130 win over Rotherham United in the League Cup third round. He played a neat one-two with Benteke, took the first touch to control with his favoured left foot and finished with his right within the box. His performances in the opening months of the season earned him the Aston Villa Player of the Month award for August, September and October 2013. Delph scored for the first time in Premier League with \"a goal of brutal brilliance\" to complete a 3\u20132 win away at Southampton on 4 December.

She won Charlton's Player of the Year and the FA Women's Young Player of the Year in her first season, 2001\u201302. A back injury ruled Williams out of much of the 2002\u201303 season. In May 2003 Williams scored an unfortunate own goal three minutes after coming on as a substitute in Charlton's 3\u20130 FA Women's Cup final defeat to Fulham. She headed a corner from Fulham's Rachel Unitt \u2013 Williams' England teammate and then flatmate \u2013 into her own net. In 2003\u201304 Williams returned to form and was an important part of the Charlton Athletic side who challenged for all three domestic trophies. She started Charlton's second successive FA Women's Cup final in May 2004, but suffered another 3\u20130 defeat as Julie Fleeting scored a hat-trick for Arsenal. Although Arsenal also pipped Charlton to the League title by a single point, Williams collected an FA Women's Premier League Cup winners' medal when Charlton beat Fulham 1\u20130 at Underhill in March 2004. Williams surprisingly moved to Everton Ladies in summer 2004, where fans gave her the nickname \"Queen Fara\". In 2004\u201305 Williams lost her third FA Women's Cup final in a row, to former club Charlton. She won another League Cup medal in 2007\u201308 as Everton defeated Arsenal at Brisbane Road. Williams missed two penalties, one in normal time and one in the shoot-out, as Everton were edged out by Leeds in the FA Women's Cup semi-final at Haig Avenue. In 2008\u201309 Everton missed out on the League title on goal difference after a final day defeat to Arsenal. However, Williams' performances saw her voted FA Players' Player of the Year. On 23 September 2009 Williams was picked in the Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) International Draft by Philadelphia Independence. She was due to join up with her England teammate Lianne Sanderson in America, before deciding to stay with Everton. Williams' loyalty was rewarded with another two Cup finals in 2010: a defeat to Leeds Carnegie in the Premier League Cup, in which Williams scored Everton's consolation, followed by a memorable extra\u2013time win over Arsenal in the FA Women's Cup. In November 2012 Williams and Natasha Dowie left Everton for local rivals Liverpool, who were hoping to build a squad capable of ending Arsenal's dominance of English women's football. Liverpool beat Bristol Academy 2\u20130 on the final day to secure the 2013 FA WSL league title. Liverpool retained their title in 2014, but were much less successful in 2015.

On 5 January 2016, Liverpool confirmed that Williams would be leaving the club to sign for deposed former champions Arsenal Ladies. Williams said: \"I have really enjoyed my time at Liverpool Ladies and will take away some absolutely fantastic memories.

She went on to play in all three of England's group games at the World Cup, and scored a penalty in England's 6\u20131 win over Argentina. However, she also picked up her second yellow card of the group stage in that match, and so missed the quarter-final defeat by the United States through suspension. On 23 May, Williams picked up the 2007 FA International Player of the Year Award. On 8 May 2008 England played Belarus in the UEFA Women's Euro 2009 qualifying and Williams scored a hat-trick of long-range goals. In May 2009 Williams was again named FA International Player of the Year, and was also voted FA Players' Player of the Year. At the Euro 2009 final tournament in Finland, Williams scored a penalty during England's first game against Italy. However, England lost the match 2\u20131 after Williams' error resulted in a red card for Casey Stoney. England improved and Williams, captain in the absence of the injured Faye White, scored in a 3\u20132 quarter final win over hosts Finland. She also featured in the semi-final win over the Netherlands and 6\u20132 final defeat by Germany. Williams was England's top-scorer with seven goals during qualifying for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. A knee injury sustained in a WSL match with Lincoln Ladies left her battling for fitness ahead of the finals. Despite this, Williams was \"more than pleased\" to be named in the squad on 10 June 2011. At the final tournament, she headed the first goal of England's campaign in the 1\u20131 draw with Mexico and also featured against New Zealand before being rested for the final group game, a 2\u20130 victory over Japan. Williams played 120 minutes in the quarter-final exit to France. She was not among the penalty takers in England's penalty shootout defeat. Williams earned her 100th Cap in the 2012 Cyprus Cup against Switzerland on 1 March 2012. England won the game 1\u20130 with Williams proud to score the only goal of the game: \"It's a massive achievement to reach 100 caps and getting the goal made it extra special.\" She was part of the England squad which performed poorly at UEFA Women's Euro 2013 and was eliminated in the first round. On 3 August 2014, Williams led the England team out against Sweden and became the most capped player in the history of English football, with 130 Caps. England won the match 4\u20130 in Hartlepool. At the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada, Williams scored a 38th-minute penalty kick against Colombia, as England won 2\u20131 in Montreal on 17 June. In the semi-final in Edmonton on 2 July, Williams converted her second penalty of the tournament, in the 40th minute, to give England an equaliser against defending champions Japan. England lost the game 2\u20131. Two days later, and back in Edmonton, Williams scored another penalty, on this occasion in extra time, to give England the winning goal in a 1\u20130 victory over Germany. Her crucial goal gave England their first ever win over Germany and secured a bronze medal, the team's best ever finish at the FIFA Women's World Cup. Williams was not included in England's squad for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, but manager Phil Neville said her international career was not over."

Campbell attended Santa Teresa High School in San Jose, California. In 1980, during his senior year at the University of California, he set a then-NCAA record with 43 completed passes in 53 attempts in a losing effort against the Florida Gators. In four NFL seasons, Campbell played in just seven games with no starts. He was hampered by a weak throwing arm; offensive coordinator Bob Schnelker said Campbell didn't have the arm strength to play in the NFL. After he held out of minicamp, the Packers traded Campbell to the Los Angeles Raiders, where he never played a game. He has since become a newspaper columnist at Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers. As of the end of the 2020 season, Campbell is the last top-nine pick since the AFL-NFL merger to never start a regular season game. He is also the only quarterback selected in the top 30 from 1970 to 2019 to have never started a game. After Campbell's career ended, the Packers did not draft another quarterback in the first round until 2005, when Aaron Rodgers, also from the University of California, became a Packer."

Carlyle made his Braves debut on May 26, 2007, in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, a game in which he went four innings, surrendering five earned runs on six hits and allowing two walks. It was his first start in the major leagues since 1999. Carlyle earned his first win of the season and his first since 1999 on June 5, surrendering one hit, a solo home run to Aaron Boone of the Florida Marlins, while going seven innings. On July 6, 2007, against the Padres, Carlyle tied his career-high with seven strikeouts, set a new career-high with eight innings pitched, and collected his first major league RBI which gave the Braves a 3\u20132 lead they would not relinquish. In the fourth inning of that game, Carlyle threw an immaculate inning by striking out the side on nine total pitches; it was the 40th time in major-league history that the feat had been accomplished. Reflecting on Carlyle's performance, then Braves manager Bobby Cox noted that \"[Carlyle's] sneaky quick. A lot of guys don't have good hacks at him. He gets it by them.\" He finished his best season with an 8\u20137 record and a 5.21 ERA. Carlyle started the 2008 season for the Triple-A Richmond Braves, but was promoted to Atlanta on April 15 with an injury to Peter Moylan. Carlyle ended the season with an ERA of 3.59 with 59 strikeouts in 45 games. On October 9, 2009, Carlyle was outrighted to the Gwinnett Braves and he elected free agency."

Porcello had been described as an \"ace\" who could be a \"bona fide No. 1 starter.\" He was also known as a \"special\" pitcher. Porcello was signed by the Detroit Tigers to a $7.28 million, four-year deal with two one-year options. The total contract is worth $11.1 million, making Porcello the highest-paid high schooler ever.

On April 1, Dombrowski confirmed that Porcello would make the 2009 opening day roster after posting a 2.63 ERA in five Grapefruit League games. Dombrowski stated: On April 9, Porcello made his Major League debut against Toronto, opposite Blue Jays rookie pitcher Ricky Romero. The game marked the first time in MLB history that two first-round picks faced each other in their respective debuts. Porcello pitched five innings and took the loss for Detroit. He struck out four batters and allowed four runs on eight hits. On April 19, Porcello earned his first career win in an 8\u20132 victory over the Seattle Mariners. He allowed one run and struck out three in seven innings with no walks. He retired the final 14 batters he faced. Porcello won all five games he started in May. He became the youngest pitcher to win five starts in a row since Dwight Gooden won seven in a row in 1985, as well as the first Tiger age 20 or younger to win five consecutive starts since at least 1954 (research prior to that year is incomplete). On August 11, during a game against the Boston Red Sox, Porcello hit Kevin Youkilis with a pitch. Youkilis charged the mound, threw his helmet right in front of Porcello, and tackled him to the ground as both benches cleared. Both players were ejected for the brawl and were sentenced to five-game suspensions. Despite his youth, Porcello was selected by Tiger manager Jim Leyland to pitch in the one-game tie-breaker playoff for the AL Central Division crown after the Tigers and Minnesota Twins both finished the regular season at 86\u201376. Porcello allowed two runs (one earned) in  innings of work, getting a no-decision in the game that the Twins eventually won in 12 innings. Porcello finished the 2009 season with a 14\u20139 record and 3.96 ERA.

The team was impressed enough to offer him a contract and he spent the 2001 season in San Diego. In San Diego, Alcaraz-Culler quickly established himself as a starter that provided him with a productive debut season where he recorded six goals and tallied 3 assists. The Flash folded at the end of the season and he moved to the Portland Timbers in 2002. Under the management of Bobby Howe, he was deployed as a playmaker for the Timbers. His first prosperous season came in 2003, where he helped the Timbers record the club\u2019s third straight winning season including an impressive four-game winning streak. He set the single-season team record for assists at nine. In the 2004 season, Alcaraz-Cuellar contributed by leading the offense with 10 assists that culminated with the Timbers finishing first in the Western Conference, with a record total of 57 points that claimed the league\u2019s Regular Season Championship for the first time in the club's 29-year history. However, they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by their long-standing rival, the Seattle Sounders.  Once the season reached to a conclusion, he was awarded the Assist Leader Statistical Award and received All-League honors. In 2005, the Timbers continued their winning ways and finished the year with their fifth straight winning season. Alcaraz-Cuellar managed to re-set the club\u2019s record for assists in a single season, recording 12 assists which placed him to first in the league in assists for the second straight season, becoming the first player in league history to win the honor consecutively. He also earned a second All-League selection. During his tenure with Portland, he also established himself as the Timbers' all-time leader in assists, with 44. His contract expired in 2006 and the Timbers did not express an interest in re-signing him. Alcaraz-Cueller signed a contract with Cascadian rivals the Seattle Sounders after Adrian Hanauer, owner of the Sounders, and Brian Schmetzer drove to Portland to ask him to sign with Seattle. He selected the number 77 because the number 7 jersey was worn by Leighton O'Brien. In his debut season with the Sounders, he contributed two goals and eight assists, which tied him for second in the league. Alcaraz-Cuellar helped his team win the double by claiming the USL First Division Commissioner's Cup, and his first career USL First Division Championship. At the end of the 2008 campaign, Alcaraz-Cuellar's contract was not renewed by the club and he became a free agent."

        "content": "On July 29, 2009, the Phillies traded Carrasco, along with Jason Donald, Lou Marson, and Jason Knapp to the Cleveland Indians for Cliff Lee and Ben Francisco. Carrasco made his major league debut on September 1. In five starts with the Indians, he had a 0\u20134 record with 8.87 ERA. During the 2010 season, Carrasco had a 2\u20132 record and 3.83 ERA in seven starts for Cleveland. On July 29, 2011, against the Kansas City Royals, Carrasco surrendered a season-high 7 runs over  innings highlighted by a grand slam by outfielder Melky Cabrera. Cookie took out his frustration by throwing a pitch over the head of Kansas City Royals' designated hitter Billy Butler resulting his ejection by home plate umpire Scott Barry. Carrasco made 21 starts for Cleveland, pitching to an 8\u20139 record with 4.62 ERA and striking out 86 batters in  innings. In September 2011, Carrasco underwent Tommy John surgery and eventually missed the entire 2012 season as a result. On April 9, 2013, Carrasco made his first start since his Tommy John surgery and suspension. His season began with a rather poor outing against the New York Yankees during which he surrendered seven runs in  innings and hit batter Kevin Youkilis resulting in his ejection by home plate umpire Jordan Baker. On April 10, 2013, Carrasco was optioned to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers, and eventually suspended eight games for hitting Youkilis. He was recalled to the majors on June 8, and then sent back down to Triple-A on June 24. He was recalled on July 6, and then designated for assignment on July 7. He was then optioned to Columbus on July 9. Carrasco's record for the 2013 season with Cleveland was 1\u20134 with a 6.75 ERA. For the 2014 season, Carrasco appeared in 40 games for Cleveland (14 starts) and had an 8\u20137 record with 2.55 ERA while striking out 140 batters in 134 innings. On April 7, 2015, Carrasco signed a 4-year extension worth $22 million that also includes club options for 2019 and 2020. During a game against the Chicago White Sox on April 14, Carrasco was struck in the face by a line drive off the bat of Melky Cabrera. He left the game as he was carted off on a motor stretcher. Carrasco had a bruise on his jaw while X-rays were negative. On July 1, Carrasco took a no-hitter into the ninth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays, only to surrender a two-out, two-strike single to Joey Butler before retiring the side. It would have been the first no-hitter by an Indians pitcher since Len Barker's perfect game on May 15, 1981. On July 19, Carrasco hit the first single of his major league career against the Cincinnati Reds' Johnny Cueto in the top of the second inning. Carrasco went six innings giving up four hits and one earned run with a no decision. In 30 starts during the 2015 season, Carrasco compiled a 14\u201312 record with a 3.63 ERA, and struck out 216 batters in  innings. Carrasco made two trips to the disabled list in 2016, the second of which resulted from a line drive to his right hand on September 17 that fractured the fifth metacarpal bone. This injury forced Carrasco to miss the entire postseason. Carrasco finished the 2016 season with an 11\u20138 record and 3.32 ERA in 25 starts, recording 150 strikeouts in  innings. In the fifth inning of a July 7, 2017, game against the Detroit Tigers, Carrasco pitched an immaculate inning, striking out the side on the minimum nine pitches. He became only the second pitcher in Indians history to do so, following Justin Masterson in 2014, and the 84th in Major League history. Carrasco struck out 14 Minnesota Twins batters on September 28, in a 5\u20132 game to give Cleveland their 100th win of the season. For the 2017 season, Carrasco was 18\u20136 with a 3.29 ERA, striking out 226 in 200 innings.

On December 6, 2018, Carrasco signed a contract extension through the 2022 season with a club option for the 2023 season. On June 5, 2019, Carrasco was placed on the 10-day injured list, with the team stating that he had been \"diagnosed with a blood condition.\" He subsequently spent the remainder of June on the injured list. On July 6, 2019, Carrasco revealed that he had been diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia, a treatable form of leukemia. On August 28, 2019, Carrasco was activated from the IL. On September 1, he made his first appearance since his diagnosis, pitching an inning in relief against the Tampa Bay Rays. Carrasco was named the 2019 AL Comeback Player of the Year. With the 2020 Cleveland Indians, Carrasco appeared in 12 games, compiling a 3\u20134 record with 2.91 ERA and 82 strikeouts in 68 innings pitched."

On August 19, 1951, St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck put the 3 foot, 7\u00a0inch Eddie Gaedel into the game with instructions to hold his bat on his shoulder and not swing. Cain later recalled: \"I went out to the mound to start to pitch the bottom half of the first and as I was warming up, Eddie went over and got these little bats. We couldn't understand what was going on.\" In his crouch, Gaedel reportedly had a strike zone of 1 inches. Detroit catcher, Bob Swift, advised Cain to \"keep it low.\" According to observers, Cain was laughing so hard at the prospect of pitching to Gaedel that \"he's practically falling off the mound with each pitch.\" Cain proceeded to walk Gaedel on four straight pitches, all high. Cain pitched five seasons in the major leagues with the Chicago White Sox (1949\u20131951), Detroit Tigers (1951), and St. Louis Browns (1952\u20131953), also appearing a pinch-hitter in one game for the White Sox in 1954.

        "content": "Morales started playing sandlot baseball in his homeland before signing his first professional contract to play in Puerto Rico in late 1963. The San Francisco Giants signed Morales in 1963. He spent two seasons in Class-A (1964\u201365) and three more at Double-A (1966\u201368). The Oakland Athletics obtained him from the Giants in the 1968 minor league draft, and though Morales finally advanced to Triple-A, he remained with the Iowa Oaks of the American Association from 1969 to 1971. Then he played on loan to Tidewater, the Mets' Triple-A affiliate, in 1972. Finally, he reached the majors in 1973 with the Athletics, playing for them during part of the season before joining the Montreal Expos (1973\u201377), Minnesota Twins (1978\u201380), Baltimore Orioles (1981\u201382) and Los Angeles Dodgers (1982\u201384). Morales spent nine seasons in the minor leagues before turning into one of the premier pinch-hitters in major league history. One main problem held up his advance: as a catcher, he was a defensive liability, leading four different minor leagues in errors. Indeed, during his majors career, he appeared in the field in only 104 of his 733 total games, and he never collected more than 242 at-bats during a regular season. He is often referred as \"a catcher by trade\" (30 games), though first base was his most frequent defensive position in the majors (67) and eventually at left field (7). He played much more at DH (265 games) than at any fielding position. In 1975, Morales enjoyed his first solid season, batting .301 in 93 games with Montreal. For the first of four times, he led the majors pinch-hitters with 15 hits in 51 at-bats (.294). Then, in 1976 he posted a career-high .316 (50-for-158) as he went on to set his pinch-hit single-season record of 25, breaking the previous mark of 24 established by Dave Philley in 1961 and tied by Vic Davalillo in 1970. Morales' record stood until John Vander Wal of the Colorado Rockies had 28 in 1995."

In 1978 he hit .314 for the Twins and posted an American League leading with 15 pinch-hits. Morales faded the next season (.267), then rebounded in 1980 hitting .303 with eight home runs (a career-high) as his 13 pinch-hits again led the league. Again in the National League, he appeared exclusively as a pinch-hitter with the Dodgers in 1982 and finished 9-for-30 (.300). He saw his only post-season action in 1983, going hitless in two pinch-hit at-bats as Los Angeles lost the NL Championship Series to the Philadelphia Phillies. In a 12-season career, Morales was a .287 hitter (375-for-1305) with 26 home runs and 207 RBI, including 126 runs, 68 doubles and six triples, hitting .300 five times overall. He struck out in only 13% of his plate appearances (182-for-1305), a testament to his skill as a contact hitter. Over his two decades-plus in the Puerto Rican Winter League, he collected a .290 batting average (840-for-2,901) with 84 home runs and 467 RBI. He also led the league three times in doubles and one in hits. In the 1968\u201369 season he hit .402 with the San Juan Senators, becoming one of 19 players to break the .400 line in the PRWL. However, his 112 at-bats did not qualify him for the batting title, as he was backing up teammate Johnny Bench."

At 16 years old he was invited to the Moldova U-17 team, which participated at \"Football Federation of Moldova Cup\". Having scored 2 goals and making 2 assists in three matches, and showing excellent performance, after the tournament he was invited by the Moldovan Champions - Sheriff Tiraspol. \u021a\u00eeg\u00eerla\u0219 played 2 years for Sheriff's second team and in so doing drew the attention of Shakhtar Donetsk. He signed the contract with Ukrainian giant, and at the same time secured himself a starter spot on the Moldova U-21 team, for whom he played more than 20 matches. In 2005 \u021a\u00eeg\u00eerla\u0219 spent first part of the year in Arsenal Kharkiv and then he was transferred to another Ukrainian team \u2013 FC Kharkiv, where, thanks to his universalism (\u021a\u00eeg\u00eerla\u0219 is able to play on the right or left flank, forward or offense), he has been one of important players of the team. After Vladimir Bessonov was named new head coach of FC Kharkiv, the club parted with \u021a\u00eeg\u00eerla\u0219 and most of the other foreign players. In the Spring of 2007, Igor \u021a\u00eeg\u00eerla\u0219 came to Zimbru Chi\u015fin\u0103u on loan from FC Kharkiv. He played 10 matches in the Moldovan championship, scored 1 goal and made 9 assists. In the Moldova Cup final, Zimbru won against Nistru, and \u021a\u00eeg\u00eerla\u0219 won the first trophy of his career. Despite playing at Zimbru for only 3 months, at the end of the year, he was included in the symbolic \"Zimbru 2006/07 Ideal Team\". \u00bb. Igor \u021a\u00eeg\u00eerla\u0219 was to win two more trophies in 2007. In the Summer, the Latvian champions, FK Ventspils, bought his transfer from FC Kharkiv. With FK Ventspils, \u021a\u00eeg\u00eerla\u0219 won both the Latvian championship and the Latvian Cup. He also played in the Baltic League final. He helped FK Ventspils to catch up with then leaders, Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs, despite 14 points handicap, and scored a crucial goal in a head-to-head match between the teams. In 2009, his goal against BATE Borisov helped Ventspils to reach the Play-off Round of the UEFA Champions League and eventually play in UEFA Europa League group stage after losing to FC Zurich, against whom \u021a\u00eeg\u00eerla\u0219 also scored. In February 2010, he joined Metalurh Zaporizhya in Ukraine. On 26 February 2011, it was announced that \u021a\u00eeg\u00eerla\u0219 joined Chornomorets on a 6-month loan from FC Metalurh Zaporizhya, with the right to purchase at the end of the season. This right was exercised in June, 2011, and \u021a\u00eeg\u00eerla\u0219 joined Chornomorets on a permanent basis.

Following Dundee's relegation from the Scottish Premier League, Robertson became a regular in the First Division, missing just one league match in the 2005\u201306 season.

        "content": "After rejecting a new contract in April 2008, and with his contract close to expiry, Robertson signed for Dundee's rivals Dundee United on 3 June 2008, with Craig Levein \u2013 then in charge at United \u2013 getting the player he had tried to sign three years previously. The 23-year-old joined the Tannadice club under freedom of contract and agreed a three-year deal. Dundee openly criticised United about the way they pursued Robertson, stating that United had been \"disrespectful\" towards their Dee rivals. In September, Robertson scored his first goal, netting in the League Cup victory over Airdrie United. Four days later, Robertson scored his first league goal, netting the third in a 3\u20130 win over Hearts and by mid-November, had played every minute of United's matches that season. In January, however, an osteitis pubis diagnosis ruled him out for the remaining few months of the season, although he made one substitute appearance in May. After his recovery, Robertson revealed that he credited surgeon David Lloyd for saving his career and revealed it was the hardest moment of his career. He also said that 2009 was his worst year. In the 2009\u201310 season, Robertson again started as a regular, featuring in the first four matches of the season before being sent off in the 1\u20131 draw at Celtic. In October the Dundee director, Calum Melville, publicly stated he was planning to bid \u00a3500,000 for the Scotland international in the January transfer window. United, however, were not impressed and threatened to haul him in front of the SFA over these comments. Craig Levein, the United manager, criticised the Dundee director by suggesting he needs tutored in the workings of football. Dundee manager Jocky Scott was also reluctant to sign Robertson, especially not in the near future. During the season, Robertson suffered various injuries, mostly an Inguinal Hernia, which ruled him out for the remaining few months of the season before making his return in late-April against Motherwell. Robertson came on as a substitute in the 2010 Scottish Cup Final win, picking up his first winners medal. After the match, Robertson talked about winning the final and said \"It's been a long 18 months and while the Cup Final doesn't make up for all the frustration and pain that I went through, it helps quite a bit. And I'm proud to have played a part in this win and somehow got a winner's medal that I never dreamed could have come my way two months ago.\". Shortly after, Robertson signed a 12-month contract extension, that will expire in 2012 In the 2010\u201311 season, Robertson, once again, started as a regular, featuring more often unlike the last two seasons and managed to survive the season without injuries. Robertson also made two appearances in the Europa League, but Dundee United were eliminated in the qualification round against Greek side AEK Athens. Unfortunately, on 22 January 2011, he was, again, sent off in a 1\u20131 draw against Kilmarnock. In the 2011\u201312 season, Robertson suffered an ankle injury limped out of a pre-season friendly with Forfar Athletic. His injury would cause him to miss the start of the season. He missed the opening game of the season before returning in the following game against Hearts. In mid-October, Manager Peter Houston began negotiating a new deal with Robertson and many other players. On 19 November 2011, Robertson scored his first goal in a 1\u20130 win over Hearts. It was his first goal in three years. Two months later, on 7 January 2012, in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup, Robertson scored and provided an assist for Gary Mackay-Steven in a 6\u20132 win over Airdrie United. Later in the season, Robertson scored five more goals in the league, including a winner against Celtic on 6 May 2012. After the match, Robertson said he might stay at Dundee United, although many clubs in England including Birmingham City, Brentford and Blackpool. were interested in him."

Three days after joining the club, Robertson made his debut for Hibs in a 1\u20130 loss against Ross County. Robertson scored his first goal for Hibs on 15 May 2013, in a 3\u20131 win against Kilmarnock. He later admitted that he should have scored for Hibs earlier than that, particularly when he missed an easy chance in a Scottish Cup tie against Falkirk. In the 2013 Scottish Cup Final, Robertson was an unused substitute as Hibernian lost 3\u20130 to Celtic. Despite the loss, Robertson made twelve appearances and scoring once. In the 2013\u201314 season, Robertson came on as a substitute in both legs as Hibernian suffered a 9\u20130 aggregate in Europa League qualifying to Swedish side Malm\u00f6, including a 7\u20130 reverse in the home leg. Robertson scored the club's first goal of the season, in a 1\u20131 draw against Dundee United on 17 August. Although he continued to be involved in the first team after Terry Butcher became manager, Robertson sustained medial knee ligament damage in February 2014. Robertson made his return to training in mid-April after nine weeks' absence. Butcher was unwilling to risk returning Robertson quickly to the team. Robertson made his first team return on 27 April 2014, in the Edinburgh derby, in a 2\u20131 loss against Hearts. Robertson started both legs in the playoff against Hamilton Academical, as Hibernian lost 4\u20132 in a penalty shootout, which resulted in Hibernian being relegated to the Scottish Championship. Despite this, Robertson went on to make thirty-one appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Robertson later reflected that the season had been a \"disaster\". In the 2014\u201315 season, Robertson continued to be in the first team under the management of Alan Stubbs. Robertson scored his first goal of the season on 4 October, in a 1\u20131 draw against Raith Rovers. He suffered from a broken hand in November, then scored his second goal of the season in a 4\u20130 win against Rangers on 27 December. Robertson scored two goals in consecutive games in January, in a 5\u20130 win over Cowdenbeath and a 2\u20130 win against Queen of the South. Two weeks later on 13 February 2015, Robertson scored his fifth goal of the season, in a 2\u20130 win at Rangers. Robertson's sixth and last goal of the season came on 22 April, in a 3\u20131 win over Livingston. Robertson was included in the second playoff match against Rangers, but Hibs lost 2\u20131 on aggregate. Robertson scored six goals in 41 appearances for Hibs in the 2014\u201315 season. Despite being keen to sign a contract at the club, Robertson left Hibs at the end of the season under freedom of contract. Following this, Robertson expressed \"devastation\" to not be at the club for the next season and was keen to stay, citing his family."

In 2002, he moved south to join professional club Toulouse. Sissoko spent four years in the club's youth academy and made his professional debut in the 2007\u201308 season.

He signed an aspirant (youth) contract and was placed in the club's under-14 team. Sissoko spent three years developing in the club's youth academy alongside future teammates Cheikh M'Bengue and \u00c9tienne Capoue before earning a call up to the club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth level of French football, ahead of the 2006\u201307 season. Sissoko appeared in 18 matches during the amateur season, quickly becoming one of the club's most sought after prospects. Prior to signing his professional contract with Toulouse, he garnered interest from English clubs Liverpool and Bolton Wanderers. Midway through the 2006\u201307 season, Sissoko signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal with Toulouse until June 2010. He was subsequently promoted to the club's senior team in the ensuing summer and assigned the number 22 shirt by manager Elie Baup. Sissoko made his professional debut on 4 August 2007, appearing as a substitute in a 3\u20131 defeat to Valenciennes. He made his first professional start the following week in the club's 1\u20130 upset victory over the defending champions Lyon. On 15 August, he appeared in the club's UEFA Champions League third qualifying round first leg match against Liverpool. Sissoko replaced Albin Ebondo in the 83rd minute and received a yellow card in the final minute. Toulouse lost the first leg 1\u20130 and the tie 5\u20130 on aggregate. Sissoko scored his first professional goal on 1 September 2007 in a 2\u20130 victory over Auxerre, scoring in injury time after coming on as a substitute two minutes previously. In late September, he began featuring in the team as a regular starter playing in the defensive midfielder role alongside attackers Achille Emana and Fod\u00e9 Mansar\u00e9, and captain Nicolas Dieuze. On 6 January 2008, Sissoko scored his second goal of the season against Paris in the Coupe de France. Toulouse surprisingly lost the match to the semi-professional club 2\u20131. Despite the promising individual season from Sissoko, Toulouse finished one place above relegation and Baup was sacked and replaced by Alain Casanova. Following the season, on 25 July 2008, Sissoko signed a contract extension with the club until 2012."

The move allowed Sissoko to retain his defensive duties, but also showcase his attacking skills. He began the season featuring primarily as a substitute under Casanova, but by December, Sissoko had become a regular in the starting eleven. On 24 January 2009, he scored his first goal of the season against amateur Alsatian club FCE Schirrhein in an 8\u20130 thrashing in the Coupe de France. It was a memorable goal with Sissoko running nearly the entire pitch with the ball at his feet, eluding several Schirrhein players, before finishing at the six-yard box. Toulouse reached the semi-finals of the competition before losing 2\u20131 to the eventual winners Guingamp. In the league, Sissoko was a key contributor in helping a refurbished Toulouse side finish 4th in the league, leading to qualification for the newly created UEFA Europa League. He scored his first goal of the league campaign on 7 February in a 2\u20130 victory over Le Mans. Sissoko also scored goals in victories over Derby de la Garonne rivals Bordeaux and Paris Saint-Germain. In total, he made 40 appearances and scored five goals. For his efforts, he was nominated for the UNFP Young Player of the Year, along with teammate Capoue who also had an outstanding season. Prior to the start of the 2009\u201310 season, Sissoko drew strong interest from Premier League outfit Tottenham Hotspur. The English club reportedly offered as much as \u00a312 million for the player and subsequently increased its offer to \u00a315.5 million before president Olivier Sadran declared that Sissoko would not be sold. Despite Sadran's comments, fellow Premier League club Manchester City, as well as Italian clubs Internazionale and Juventus, and German club Bayern Munich were also linked with Sissoko. To quash the rumours, Sadran announced that Sissoko would not leave the club for anything less than \u20ac30 million. Sissoko started the 2009\u201310 campaign by displaying his attacking prowess as he scored six league goals in the club's first 12 matches. He opened the campaign scoring in the club's second league match of the season against Saint-\u00c9tienne in a 3\u20131 victory. On 20 September 2009, he scored in the club's 2\u20130 win against Le Mans and in the following week scored the opening goal in the club's 2\u20131 loss to Lyon. On 1 October 2009, Sissoko scored his first career European goal in a UEFA Europa League group stage match against Belgian club Brugge. The match ended in a 2\u20132 draw. On 24 October, Sissoko recorded his fourth league goal of the season in a 2\u20130 away victory over Lens. In the ensuing two weeks, Sissoko scored both openers in a 1\u20131 draw with Marseille and a 3\u20132 victory at home against Rennes. Sissoko's goalscoring slowed in the latter part of the season, scoring only one goal after the winter break against Valenciennes in a 3\u20131 win. He was a regular in the team for the rest of the season, but Toulouse failed to keep pace with the league leaders and finished a disappointing 14th. Despite interest from several clubs, Sissoko opted to remain at Toulouse stating he was happy to remain at the club and would let his agent deal with his transfer situation. He scored his first goal of the new season on 22 September 2010 in a 2\u20131 defeat to Boulogne-sur-Mer in the Coupe de la Ligue. On 6 February 2011, Sissoko scored both team goals in a 2\u20130 win over Monaco."

It was rumoured that Sissoko waived any signing on fee from his new club in order to push the move through after Toulouse were unwilling to let him leave until the summer, when his contract expired. He was given the number 7 shirt. He made his debut for Newcastle on 29 January, getting the assist for the opening goal in a 2\u20131 win against Aston Villa. In his second match, his first at St James' Park, Sissoko scored both the equalising and winning goals in a 3\u20132 comeback victory against Chelsea. On 24 February, Sissoko scored in a 4\u20132 win against Southampton. Sissoko's first goal of the 2013\u201314 season came on 30 November, against West Bromwich Albion, a 25-yard strike which made the score 2\u20131. In the closing minutes of a game against Southampton in December, he was involved in an incident in which he accidentally hit referee Mike Jones in the face when trying to pull away from the opposing goalkeeper. He scored twice in a 4\u20131 win away at Hull City in March 2014, in what the Chronicle reporter, Neil Cameron, described as an \"utterly superb\" performance. In the 2014\u201315 season, Sissoko was given the captain's armband after Fabricio Coloccini sustained an injury. In his first match starting as captain, Sissoko scored his first league goal of the season in a 1\u20130 win over Queens Park Rangers. On 29 November 2014, Sissoko was shown two yellows in the space of 45 seconds, in a 1\u20130 away defeat to West Ham United. On 1 January 2015, Sissoko scored his second league goal of the season, as Newcastle drew 3\u20133 against Burnley. On 13 April 2015, Sissoko was sent off in an away match at Liverpool, receiving a second yellow card from referee Lee Mason, after a dangerous tackle to Lucas Leiva. On 24 May 2015, the final day of the season, he scored the opening goal in a 2\u20130 home victory over West Ham United, which helped Newcastle clinch their Premier League safety. During the 2015\u201316 season, Sissoko was made captain for the final six games of the season, and in his first game as captain on 16 April 2016, he scored his one and only goal of the campaign in a 3\u20130 home victory against Swansea City. This sparked a six-game unbeaten run in Newcastle's relegation battle, which included creditable draws against Liverpool and Manchester City, and a final day 5\u20131 win over Tottenham Hotspur. Despite this, Newcastle were unable to escape the drop zone and were relegated to the Championship."

Tottenham, who beat out Everton for his signature on the final day of the transfer deadline, gave Sissoko his debut away at Stoke City on 10 September 2016. On 22 October, in a match against AFC Bournemouth, Sissoko elbowed Harry Arter, resulting in a three-match ban. He did not play a league match again for Spurs until 3 December, and made just four more starts in the Premier League that season under manager Mauricio Pochettino. Following a disappointing first season at Tottenham, Sissoko was afforded an extended run in the first team to open the 2017\u201318 season after multiple injuries in the midfield. He received his fourth start in six Premier League games in a 3\u20132 win at West Ham on 23 September, with Pochettino describing his performance as \"fantastic\", and scored his first goal for Tottenham on 30 September 2017 in their 4\u20130 victory of Huddersfield Town. In the 2018\u201319 season, Sissoko emerged as a crucial member of Tottenham, making 43 appearances in all competitions. His improvement this season has been noted by a number of writers, some of whom ranked him amongst the best players of the season in the Premier League. He also won plaudits from former players and fans alike. He won the inaugural Tottenham Hotspur Legends' Player of the Season award in May 2019. At the final of the 2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League, Sissoko's arm was hit by the ball on the rebound in the box after 22 seconds. Judged a handball, it resulted in a penalty converted by Liverpool and one that Tottenham could not overcome, eventually losing 2\u20130. In the 2019\u201320 season, under new manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Sissoko scored his first goal in over two years in the match against Bournemouth. This is only his second Premier League goal for Tottenham and helped the team to a 3\u20132 win. In the 2020 New Year's Day match against Southampton, Sissoko damaged the medial collateral ligament of his right knee, which required surgery resulting in him being out of action for more than three months. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in the suspension of League matches, he did not play any game until the 19 June match against Manchester United after the season restarted. On 5 January 2021, Sissoko scored his first goal of the 2020\u201321 season in the semi-final of the Carabao Cup, which ended in a 2\u20130 home win over Brentford."

On 4 January 2005, he made his youth international debut at under-16 level in a friendly match against Turkey in Manisa. France won the match 3\u20130. Sissoko's only other appearance with the team came in the return leg against Turkey that was played in \u0130zmir two days later. With the under-17 team, Sissoko's playing time increased as France attempted to qualify for the 2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship. He made his debut as a substitute on 2 November 2005 in the team's opening competitive match against England. On 26 February 2006, Sissoko scored his first youth international goal in the team's second group stage match of the Algarve Cup against the Netherlands. In the team's next group stage match against Portugal, Sissoko scored again in a 3\u20131 victory. In UEFA competition, Sissoko and the team, composed of players such as David N'Gog, Gabriel Obertan, Adel Taarabt, and Gr\u00e9gory Sertic, failed to qualify for the 2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship, due to their second-place finish in the Elite Round portion of the competition. With the under-18 team, Sissoko appeared in all eight matches the team contested as France nearly went undefeated losing their only match 1\u20130 to Germany in Kehl. Due to his increased playing time domestically with Toulouse, Sissoko missed the 2007 edition of the Sendai Cup in Japan and numerous other under-19 tournaments and only featured in 2008 UEFA U-19 Championship qualification matches. He made his debut on 28 October 2007 in a 5\u20130 rout of Luxembourg in the first qualifying round. Similar to the competition at under-17 level, France were later eliminated in the Elite Round portion of the competition. Sissoko earned his first call up to the under-21 team for their friendly match against Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 September 2008. He subsequently made his debut in the match, which France won 1\u20130. Sissoko scored his only goal with the team on 31 March 2009 in the team's 2\u20130 win over England at the City Ground in Nottingham. He featured with the team frequently as they were attempting to qualify for the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship. The team's ultimate failure to qualify for the competition effectively ended Sissoko's under-21 career, though he still appeared in friendly matches against Turkey, Denmark, and Russia in 2010 as he was still eligible to participate in non-competitive matches."

A large, fast, physically powerful, hard-working, and energetic player, with an ability to run long distances and cover a lot of ground, Sissoko has been described as a \"well-rounded central midfielder\" who is \"tall, rangy, and strong in the tackle\". Although his consistency, passing, and technical ability have been questioned at times in the media, he possesses a solid first touch, and has demonstrated significant improvements in terms of his technique and link-up play as his career has progressed; furthermore, he is known for his direct style of play, as well as his ability to transition from defence to attack, charge forward with the ball, and run at defences on counter-attacks, courtesy of his ball-winning ability and positional sense, as well as his speed, dynamism, athleticism, and strength. He is also known for his striking ability from distance and on the run with his right foot, as well as his eye for goal from midfield.

In the 1950\u201351 season he featured 26 times. In the summer, manager Gordon Hodgson died and was replaced by Ivor Powell, who was sacked and replaced by Freddie Steele. Hayward played 28 games in 1951\u201352, though was sidelined with a back injury in February 1952.

He played six seasons in the NFL, one for the Pittsburgh Steelers and five for the Kansas City Chiefs.  As a collegian, he played wide receiver at the University of Texas. He is best remembered at UT for catching the game-winning touchdown pass on 4th down from Texas quarterback Peter Gardere in a rivalry game against Oklahoma which enabled UT to win the game 14-13 in 1990. Two of his most memorable NFL receptions were touchdown passes from Joe Montana. One was in Montana's first game against his former team, the San Francisco 49ers. The other was a 7-yard pass which was the Chiefs' first touchdown in a 28\u201320 divisional round victory over the Houston Oilers at the Astrodome on January 16, 1994. Cash finished the play by firing the football at an image of Oilers defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan's face on a banner hanging beyond the end zone. Holding no grudge against Ryan, he explained, \"I saw it as I was crossing the goal line, and it was just impulse. I just let it fly.\""

On October 29, Cheveldayoff met with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, who concluded was Cheveldayoff's involvement in the matter was too limited to justify disciplining him."

        "content": "From  to , Morales played for the GCL Twins. He mainly played second base. In , Morales was converted to catcher and played for two Single-A teams, the Quad City River Bandits and the Fort Myers Miracle. Baseball America ranked Morales the 28th best prospect in the Twins organization after the 2003 season. In , Morales had a breakout minor league season. Playing for the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings, he played in 108\u00a0games and batted .311 with 2 home runs and 37 RBI. He was named to the International League midseason and postseason All-Star teams. On September 6, 2007, with Joe Mauer and Mike Redmond banged up, his contract was purchased by the big league club. On September 8, 2007, Morales made his major league debut against the Chicago White Sox. In the second inning, he collected his first major league hit, which was a single, against Jos\u00e9 Contreras. In the third inning, he collected his second major league hit, which was a double and would eventually score. In the fifth inning, he collected his third major league hit, which was once again a single. Two batters later, Jason Tyner laid down a bunt single. When Morales was running towards second base, he lost his footing and injured his left ankle.  Chris Heintz then pinch ran for Morales. The next day, the Twins purchased the contract of Matt LeCroy and placed Morales on the 60-day DL, thus ending his 2007 season. He ended the 2007 season having played just 1\u00a0game, batted 1.000 (3-3), and scored a run. In 2008, Morales was hitting .315 with the Red Wings before going on the disabled list again June 12 with a sprained left ankle. In 2009, Morales made the Twins opening day roster due to an injury to starting catcher Joe Mauer.  During Mauer's absence, Morales split catching duties with backup catcher Mike Redmond. Morales finished the year batting .311 (37-119), which contributed to the team's decision to not bring back Redmond for 2010. Morales had surgery on his right wrist in January 2010, and was expected to be out until mid-March 2010. On September 22, 2010, Morales played first base for the first time in this career. In that game he made couple of nice plays on defense and went 3 for 4 with 3 RBIs."

He made his debut for Barnsley in a League Cup tie against Newcastle United in August 2007 coming on as a substitute for Martin Devaney during a 2\u20130 loss. Butterfield also made a substitute appearance in Barnsley's 2008 FA Cup semi-final against Cardiff City. Butterfield scored his first senior goal on 8 August 2009 with a 59th-minute goal at Hillsborough against local rivals Sheffield Wednesday. This goal proved to be vital as it spurred Barnsley on to claw back to 2\u20132 as Barnsley were 2\u20130 down at half time. He also made an appearance coming on as a substitute versus former club Manchester United in a League Cup tie in which Barnsley suffered a 2\u20130 defeat. On 17 September 2011, he captained Barnsley for the first time. It was in their 1\u20131 draw at home to Watford. Many believed at the time that Butterfield, at just 21 years of age, had become Barnsley's youngest ever captain. But, in fact, Eric Winstanley had captained the Reds at aged 19 in the 1960s. Butterfield was having an exceptional season and Premier League scouts were regularly in attendance at Oakwell. He was soon rewarded for his efforts with a call up to the England under 21 squad. Butterfield missed the rest of the 2011\u201312 season through injury following a shocking 'tackle' in the New Year's Eve derby encounter with Leeds United bringing his \"amazing\" form to an end. Scans taken after the match showed it to be torn anterior cruciate ligaments. He finished the season \u2013 albeit prematurely \u2013 with five goals to his name and a growing reputation in The Championship, described by his manager Keith Hill as the best midfielder in the league."

It became annoying,\" Franklin said. \"Eventually, it went away. That's all I ever strived for.\" Franklin was a member of the Michigan teams coached by Bo Schembechler from 1971 to 1974 and was the starting quarterback from 1972 to 1974.  Under Franklin\u2019s leadership at quarterback, Michigan tied with Ohio State for three consecutive Big Ten Conference titles from 1972 to 1974 and finished with 30 wins, 2 losses and 1 tie.  Franklin was a First Team All Big Ten quarterback in 1974 and led the team in passing and total offense every year from 1972 to 1974, becoming the second player at Michigan since Tom Harmon to accomplish that feat for three consecutive years. Franklin was voted team captain in 1974, was an Honorable Mention All American and finished sixth in the 1974 Heisman Trophy balloting. Franklin also won the 1974 Meyer Morton award, given by the M Club of Chicago for the football player show shows the greatest development and most promise as a result of spring practice and the 1972 John Maulbetsch Award, which is given to the freshman football candidate after spring practice on the basis of desire, character, capacity for leadership and future success both on and off the gridiron. Franklin is remembered for his role in the classic 1973 Michigan vs. Ohio State football game.  When the teams met, both teams were unbeaten with Ohio State ranked No. 1, and Michigan No. 4.  Michigan had outscored its opponents 320\u201358, Ohio State by a margin of 361\u201333. After an epic struggle, the game ended in a 10\u201310 tie.  Ohio State had gone to the Rose Bowl the year before, which normally would have given Michigan the tie-breaker edge. After some deliberation, the Big Ten athletic directors picked the Buckeyes.  There were several explanations including that Franklin broke his collarbone in the game, that the Wolverines failed to win on their home field, and that Ohio State had entered the game as the higher ranked team."

        "content": "Timberlake was outspoken during his time in the limelight about the importance of his Christian faith. While attending the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, he said that at one point he felt his \"whole life was really off the track\", but \"the guidance of Dr. Ernest T. Campbell, a great speaker\" at the First Presbyterian Church of Ann Arbor helped him to develop his faith. Timberlake taught Sunday school and said he intended to become a Presbyterian minister. At a speech in Mansfield, Ohio, shortly after winning the Rose Bowl in January 1965, Timberlake said, \"I couldn't have played football if it hadn't been for Jesus Christ.\"  He continued, \"God changed my life.  He promises the abundant life, which he has given me, and eternal life, which if I die I'm sure I will have.  There's peace associated with being a Christian.\" Timberlake also spoke openly of his personal conversion as he walked in a parking lot while on a night watchman's job at a Chevrolet plant in Warren, Michigan.  Timberlake defined a Christian as \"one who has Christ as his personal savior,\" and not just a person who was brought up in a Christian home or goes to church. When he signed a professional football contract with the New York Giants, Timberlake stated that he intended to take ministerial training at Princeton Theological Seminary during the off-season.  He noted, \"I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete.\"  He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: \"I see no reason why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it.\"  Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff.  He recalled that those 20 minutes were \"horrible.\"  \"You want to go home.  You want to quit football.  It is times like these when something happens to me.  I can't explain it.  I put my face in my hands and ask God to come into my heart and give me courage. He gives me peace.\" When a boy asked Timberlake for his autograph at the Giants' rookie camp in 1965, Timberlake signed his name but also wrote citations to two Bible verses: John 3:16 and 1 Peter 1:5\u20139.  The boy asked, \"What's that?\"  Timberlake explained they were Bible verses, and he told reporters he started doing it about six months earlier, hoping the kids would look up the verses.  In 1965, such public religious expressions were not common among athletes, and columnists made note of the fact that Timberlake \"packs a Bible in his suitcase and keeps one in his locker.\" While playing for the Giants in October 1965, he told an interviewer: \"I'm playing football to convey Christianity either indirectly or directly and to give me access to you people.  The eye of American is upon the sports' field, so I can reach more people playing football.  I guess you can say my goal is to spread a Christian message.\"  At that time, he was attending Princeton Theological Seminary once a week and planned to attend full-time after the football season.  Asked if the violent nature of football was inconsistent with his Christian beliefs, Timberlake noted that \"you don't need to hurt anyone to get by\" in football and that the game involved skill, timing and execution more than violence.  He then joked, \"There's nothing really wrong with good, clean violence.\""

        "content": "The New York Giants drafted Timberlake in the third round of the 1965 NFL Draft.  He signed a two-year contract with the Giants for an estimated $85,000 ($12,500 per year base plus $60,000 in bonuses and fringe benefits).  Timberlake turned down offers from the Buffalo Bills in the American Football League (AFL) and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the Canadian Football League (CFL) because he had an opportunity to compete for a starting job with the Giants. Future Pro Football Hall of Famer Y. A. Tittle\u2019s tenure with the Giants was over, and Timberlake was expected to compete in a new system that would emphasize rushing quarterbacks. Timberlake did not get the quarterback spot with the Giants and was assigned as kickoff specialist; he was also used as a kicker on long field goals for the 1965 NFL season. In a nationally televised game on October 3, 1965, at Pittsburgh, Timberlake hit a 43-yard field goal in a 23\u201313 win.  Timberlake\u2019s kick against the Pittsburgh Steelers was the last field goal by any Giants kicker that season. Early in an October 24 game against the Cleveland Browns, the Giants' main placekicker twisted an ankle. Timberlake took over as the team\u2019s full-time kicker until the season\u2019s final week.  Timberlake went 0-for-14 in field goal attempts for the rest of the season, and three of his shorter attempts were blocked. In the 1966 pre-season, Timberlake was third on the Giants' depth chart at quarterback.  In the September 1966 issue of the Sporting News, Timberlake lamented: \"I\u2019m not doing anything.  For four days the other week, I didn\u2019t throw a single pass. Not a single pass.\"  After just one season, the Giants cut Timberlake from the team on August 29, 1966, at their camp in Fairfield, Connecticut. In an article concluding that Timberlake may have been the worst placekicker in NFL history, the writer concluded: \"Timberlake\u2019s 1-for-15 performance makes him look like a laughingstock. He\u2019s better remembered as one of Michigan\u2019s great quarterbacks, a Rose Bowl hero who might have had what it took to be a fine pro quarterback or running back. It\u2019s a shame he was asked to do what he couldn\u2019t.\" Sports blog Deadspin ranked Timberlake the 2nd-worst player to ever play in the NFL, only behind quarterback Rusty Lisch."

        "content": "Because of Timberlake's poor performance as a kicker in 1965, the Giants signed Buffalo Bills kicker Pete Gogolak in 1966, who was also football's first soccer-style kicker. Previously, kickers kicked the ball straight on instead of at a soccer-style angle, which improved accuracy and is the standard at all levels of football today. This ended a \"gentleman's agreement\" between the NFL and the AFL in not signing each other's players, and would start a rash of signings that would eventually led to the two leagues merging. In an NFL Films documentary featuring Timberlake, Steve Sabol called Timberlake the \"father of the Super Bowl\", because his poor performance indirectly led to the two leagues merging and the Super Bowl being formed."

In 2003, Timberlake joined the faculty of Marquette University where he teaches courses on community service and faith, and mentors the student Habitat for Humanity chapter.  In 2007, Timberlake said he saw the community service course as \"an excellent opportunity to bring along the next generation\" to address problems of neighborhood blight, poverty, family disorganization, failure in school, and incarceration for African-American males.  He described the problems facing the poor as \"a colossal, colossal waste of human life.\"  Timberlake has been a volunteer for several years with Milwaukee's Habitat for Humanity chapter, and one of the courses he teaches at Marquette is called \"Decent and Affordable Housing,\" in which students are instructed in construction methods (and use of power tools), investigate the causes of hyper-segregation, study substandard housing as a social injustice issue, and spend part of the semester at a Habitat for Humanity work site helping to build a house.  The course is taught through the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, which has hired Timberlake as an adjunct professor.  Timberlake, who is not an engineer by trade, has overseen the construction of eleven garages through the project.  Timberlake is a proponent of gay marriage."

        "content": "Stephen James Murphy (born 11 December 1981) is a former professional ice hockey goaltender born in Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom. Murphy began playing ice hockey at the very young age of 5. He made his first professional appearances at the age of 16 with the Paisley Pirates, a team then icing in the BNL. Murphy made two appearances for the Pirates during the 1997/98 season before moving on to the Fife Flyers. Whilst in Fife, Murphy helped the Flyers win the Scottish Cup. He established himself as the Flyers' first choice goaltender despite his young age and in the 1998/99 season recorded a respectable GAA of 3.61 and a save percentage of .918. In 1999, at the age of 17, Murphy became the goaltender for the Great Britain National Team and played on five occasions for them in the World Junior Championships, proving himself to be a reliable last line of defence.  This solidified his position as the Flyers' first choice goaltender and he continued to play for them during the 1999/00 season, featuring in the BNL as well as the B&H Cup and the Christmas Cup.  Once again the Flyers made the post-season, with Murphy playing every game in the playoffs. In 2000, Murphy moved to the United States to sign for the Omaha Lancers, of the USHL. He failed to make an appearance and moved mid-season to the Cleveland Barons. Again Murphy failed to make a start but learned considerably from his time in the USA. He finished the 2000/01 season back in Scotland, once again playing for the Flyers. In the summer of 2001, Murphy played again for the Team GB junior squad but also featured for the senior team where he recorded an excellent 1.97 goals against average and a .917 save percentage. Murphy remained in Scotland for the 2001/02 term, although he signed for the Dundee Stars and played alongside British hockey great Tony Hand for the first time at club level. Murphy played 43 games for the Stars in the regular season and made 10 post season appearances, again proving his worth despite his young age. He again appeared for Team GB in 2002, in the World Cup.  Murphy remained in his hometown of Dundee for the 2002/03 season, whilst the British ice hockey organisation was undergoing considerable restructuring. Here he played with Hand for a second spell. A move followed for the 2003/04 term, this time to the Bracknell Bees, a team now playing in the transitional BNL following the collapse of the ISL. Murphy played just 8 regular season games for the Bees due to a shoulder injury which kept him off the ice for the remainder of the season. He moved into European hockey for the 2004/05 season. He found regular games with Swedish Division 1 team Br\u00e4cke IK.  Murphy proved to be an excellent signing for Br\u00e4cke and became known for his speed and agility.  After 3 months, Murphy was poached by the higher level Allsvenskan team IF Bj\u00f6rkl\u00f6ven to play out the remainder of the season for them.  Murphy adapted to the change in standard well, and completed the season as a Bj\u00f6rkl\u00f6ven player.  They failed to make the post-season however and so Murphy returned to Scotland to play in three post-season games for the Stars. The following season, after again playing for Team GB, Murphy returned to the Allsvenskan to ice for IFK Arboga IK. Arboga struggled in the league but managed to retain their Allsvenskan place through playing in the end of season relegation playoffs.  Arboga struggled financially however, prompting Murphy to return to the United Kingdom and play for the Edinburgh Capitals in the recently established EIHL, now the top level of ice hockey in the UK following the lengthy restructuring process. Murphy played every regular season game for the Capitals, and won the EIHL 'Best British Goaltender' award for his play. Despite this, the Capitals failed to make the EIHL post-season as they struggled for regular goalscorers. Murphy returned to Scandinavia and Norway to ice for Stjernen Hockey, a team playing in the GET-ligaen, the top club league in Norway.  In 36 regular season games, Murphy recorded a 3.18 GAA and a .901 PCT. In the summer of 2008, Murphy was persuaded to once again play alongside Tony Hand, with Hand now acting as player/coach of the EIHL Manchester Phoenix. Murphy had proved an excellent signing for the Phoenix and has once again established himself as the organisation's first choice goaltender.  A solid season followed for Murphy, who helped the Phoenix to both the Knockout and Challenge Cup finals and once again was awarded Best British Goaltender.  Despite the on-ice success, the Phoenix withdrew from the EIHL at the end of the season in favour of playing in the EPL, going on to sign Steve Fone as first choice goaltender. Murphy chose to remain in the EIHL however, and move on to the Belfast Giants. After over a decade in Belfast, in March 2021 Murphy was signed by fellow EIHL side Manchester Storm as one of their back-up netminders for the 2021 Elite Series. Murphy announced his retirement from the sport in July 2021."

For the 2008\u201309 campaign, Mart\u00ednez signed with Spain's RCD Espanyol. On 13 December 2008 he scored his first goal for the Catalans, in a 1\u20132 away loss to Valencia CF. Benefitting heavily from Iv\u00e1n de la Pe\u00f1a's constant injury problems, he featured regularly and netted in three consecutive wins in late April/early May 2009, all as a substitute: Sporting de Gij\u00f3n (3\u20130), Real Betis (2\u20130) and again Valencia (3\u20130, finding the net after just two minutes). Mart\u00ednez was subsequently loaned for one season to CD Tenerife, which had returned to La Liga after seven years. In an irregular campaign, where he alternated starts with the bench, he scored four of his five league goals in the last seven matches \u2013 which granted the team six points, after wins against Gij\u00f3n and Racing de Santander\u2013 but the Canary Islands side were finally relegated.

In 1994, MLB cancelled the postseason due to a strike by the Major League Baseball Players Association. As a result, spring training for the 1995 season began with replacement players in camp, but management and players eventually resolved the dispute before regular season games were played. Nevertheless, Loiselle, along with dozens of players who agreed to serve as replacement players, were subsequently blacklisted by the MLBPA. During the 1996 midseason, Loiselle was traded by San Diego along with Jeff Tabaka to the Houston Astros for Phil Plantier. A few days later, he was sent to the Pirates in exchange for Danny Darwin. Although Loiselle made his Major League debut with Pittsburgh in that season, he was one of dozens of players that never were allowed membership into the MLBPA for crossing the picket line.

As a child, Hedman originally started out playing as a goaltender. He also played hockey on the streets together with his friends, among them, famous iRacing driver Fredrik Sellgren. His father, Olle Hedman, told his son that if he left the net, he would purchase him the new helmet that he coveted. He has not played in goal since that day. Victor said \"I'm thankful for that now. You never know what would have happened otherwise.\" Hedman's other passions were flying (he has logged eight hours on a Piper PA-32), and football. His father said that his son would just outrun everyone on the field. Hedman still plays soccer in the summer, and religiously follows the sport. He supports Premier League side Manchester United F.C. In an article it was revealed that when quizzed on any player on any Premier League team, he couldn't be stumped. His dad said that his son \"probably knows more about football than hockey.\" However, \"Hedman knew that hockey would be his future, encouraged by some of the game's greats. They'd come back every summer to play for a team called the Icebreakers, inviting Hedman to play.\" Some notable players on the team included Peter Forsberg, Markus N\u00e4slund, Henrik Zetterberg, and Nicklas B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m. Hedman said that \"looking back at it now, it was an unbelievable experience.\" In 2014 Hedman started a hockey school in his hometown. The spots in the school sold out in two hours. Hedman said that \"to see the thrill in the kids' eyes, it's worth it all.\" Hedman is from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik and trains with the twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin in the off-season. In a 2016 interview with The Hockey News, Hedman explained why he wears the jersey number 77. During his childhood in Sweden, he regularly watched Colorado Avalanche games; one of the Avalanche's star players at the time, Peter Forsberg, is Swedish. A memorable moment for Hedman came at the conclusion of the 2001 Stanley Cup Finals, when Avalanche captain Joe Sakic handed the Stanley Cup to teammate Ray Bourque (one of Hedman's favorite players), who had played 22 years in the NHL before winning a championship. Hedman wore the jersey number 41 in Sweden, but when he was drafted by the Lightning, that number was already worn by Mike Smith. Hedman chose his new number, 77, as a tribute to Bourque."

When it came to deciding where to attend college, his final choices were University of Notre Dame and the University of Southern California.

        "content": "Thomas R. Williams entered USC in the 2003 recruiting class that included Reggie Bush and LenDale White. Williams started 14 games at 3 different positions (including fullback) while playing college football at USC. He was all-Pac-10 honorable mention in 2007 and was invited to the East West Shrine Game and the Hula Bowl. Williams career stats include, 74 tackles, 1 sack, 3 fumbles forced, 5 passes defensed, 5 tackles for loss, 3 interceptions, and 37 interception return yards. In 2007 Williams had 56 tackles. He had 6 tackles in the 2008 Rose Bowl. During his time with the Trojans, Williams received guidance and feedback from veteran linebackers such as Lofa Tatupu, Matt Grootegoed, Dallas Sartz, Collin Ashton, and Oscar Lua. In order to see more playing time against the more experienced linebackers ahead of him, Williams focused and excelled at special teams play, particularly kickoff coverage. During his redshirt freshman year he was an active member of the 2004 National Championship team, where he played behind Sartz at the strong-side spot. Early in the 2004 season, Williams was nicknamed \"The Hitman\" by coach Pete Carroll for his performance on special teams; the name stuck with him for his career at USC. During the 2005 season, Williams again backed up Sartz, but moved into the starting lineup for six games after Sartz suffered a shoulder injury; he also started twice in the middle and learned the weak-side responsibilities as well. During the 2006 season, when the Trojans fullbacks were decimated by injury, members of the offense such as Ryan Kalil, Sam Baker, and John David Booty, asked him to switch positions to fullback, a position he had played in high school. Thus Williams started twice at fullback and played several games that season on both offense and defense. Over the years, Williams played all three linebacker positions. Williams teammates voted him the team's most inspirational player in the 2007 season; he finished the regular season as the third-leading tackler among linebackers with 3\u00bd tackles for losses, an interception and two forced fumbles on a defense that ranked second nationally. Thomas R. Williams graduated from USC in May 2008 with a degree in sociology."

On March 28, 2013, Zatkoff was recalled by Pittsburgh to be a backup for Tomas Vokoun for a game against the Winnipeg Jets due to a neck injury suffered by Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury. Vokoun played the entire game and Zatkoff was returned to Wilkes-Barre the following day when doctors cleared Fleury to return. Zatkoff and teammate Brad Thiessen were awarded with the Harry \"Hap\" Holmes Memorial Award at the conclusion of the 2012\u201313 AHL season. The Hap Holmes Award is given to the goaltender(s) who play at least 25 games for the team that allows the fewest goals against over the course of the season. Zatkoff was expected to spend the 2013\u201314 season with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. However, a blood clot suffered by Vokoun meant that Zatkoff started the season backing up Pittsburgh starter Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury. On October 11, 2013, Zatkoff made his NHL debut, making 24 saves in a 6\u20133 loss to the Florida Panthers. His first NHL victory was a 3\u20130 shutout of the Blue Jackets in Columbus on November 2, 2013. On April 13, 2016, Zatkoff started Game 1 of the Penguins' first round series against the New York Rangers. Regular starter Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury was out with a concussion. Zatkoff made 35 saves on 37 shots and was named the game's second star, helping the Penguins to a 5\u20132 win. After two games with the Penguins, Zatkoff was replaced by Matt Murray for the starting duties, who remained in net for the rest of the playoffs despite Fleury's eventual return to the lineup. The Penguins eventually won the Stanley Cup on June 12, 2016 against the San Jose Sharks; the victory earned him a Stanley Cup ring and the nickname \"Mr. Game One\" among teammates and fans."

He was a pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Washington Senators and Detroit Tigers over all or parts of seven seasons spanning 1942\u201351. Listed at  tall and , he batted and threw right-handed. In 109 MLB games (27 as a starting pitcher) and  innings pitched, Calvert allowed 345 hits and 158 bases on balls. He struck out 102, threw five complete games and earned five saves. Born in Montreal, Quebec, Calvert broke into professional baseball in 1938. He spent most of the year playing in the Quebec Provincial League, at the time a minor league unaffiliated with MLB. He then played in three games for the Montreal Royals, and showed enough promise that the New York Giants gave him a tryout, but they passed on signing him as they felt he needed more experience.  After spending 1939 out of organized baseball, Calvert was signed by the Cleveland Indians organization to a contract in 1940, and was invited to spring training. He then spent the season with the Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League and the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Eastern League, playing in 21 total games for the two teams. He spent 1941 with Cedar Rapids, and finished the year with six wins, three losses, and a 2.39 earned run average (ERA) in 11 games. He signed with the Cleveland organization and in 1942 he won 17 of 24 decisions with a 2.22 ERA with Wilkes-Barre. That led to his call up to the Indians' roster when he made his MLB debut with two scoreless innings against the Chicago White Sox on September 24 in his only major league appearance of the season. Calvert spent three full seasons\u20141944, 1949, and 1950\u2014in the big leagues. His most notable campaign, 1949 with the Senators, saw him lead the American League in games lost (17) and in pitchers' fielding percentage (1.000 in 55 chances). His minor league career essentially ended after the 1952 season, although he got into three games in 1955 with the Class C Modesto Reds."

He was selected to pitch in the All-Star Futures Game played at Yankee Stadium during the All-Star break and was named to the U.S. Olympic Team in Beijing. He pitched seven innings to collect the win in the bronze medal game against Japan. Anderson was a highly touted young prospect; in 2008 he was ranked as the 36th-best prospect in the Major Leagues, and in 2009 he was ranked the top prospect in Oakland's system and the #7 prospect overall by Baseball America. Anderson was promoted to the Athletics as part of their opening day roster for 2009 and made his Major League debut on April 10, 2009 against the Seattle Mariners, allowing five runs in six innings to take the loss. He picked up his first win when he allowed only two earned runs in six innings against the Tampa Bay Rays on May 20. On July 6, he pitched a shutout against the Boston Red Sox striking out 9 batters, a career high. It was his first career shutout, and his first career complete game. On September 24, 2009, Anderson broke the Oakland Athletics single-season rookie strikeout record (previously set by Rick Langford in 1977), while racking up 6 strikeouts in 5 innings versus the Texas Rangers. He finished the 2009 season with an 11\u201311 record, posting a 4.06 ERA. He led the team in wins (11) and shutouts (1) and tied with Brett Tomko in strikeouts (150).

He allowed 3 hits, struck out 4 and walked 1, getting the win. In 19 starts in 2010 he was 7-6 with a 2.80 ERA. In 2011, after a June 5 outing, he was placed on the disabled list, eventually undergoing Tommy John surgery which required 13 months of rehabilitation. In 13 starts before the injury he was 3-6 with a 4.00 ERA. Anderson returned August 21, 2012 for the Athletics, allowing one run in seven innings for a win against the Minnesota Twins. However, he suffered an oblique strain during a start against the Detroit Tigers toward the 4th inning and was later pulled out, taking the loss. He spent the remainder of the 2012 season on the disabled list with the injury, and had a 4-2 record in six starts that season. Despite his limited action during the regular season, the Athletics put him on the playoff roster for the 2012 American League Division Series against the Detroit Tigers. Anderson pitched six scoreless innings in a 2\u20130 victory in game three to keep the Athletics alive, though they eventually lost the series in five games. On February 28, 2013, Anderson was named Opening Day starter for the A's for the 2013 season. He went up against Mariners ace F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez and came away with the loss.  He left his start on April 19 with what was called a sprained ankle but was later determined to be a stress fracture in his right foot. He originally hoped to return to the rotation in July, but the injury was more serious than previously thought and he was placed on the 60-day disabled list. He was eventually activated from the disabled list on August 28, though the Athletics chose to use him out of the bullpen the rest of the season. He appeared in 16 games that season, only five of which were starts and was 1-4 with a 6.04 ERA. He also appeared in relief in game four of the 2013 American League Division Series against the Tigers, allowing the two winning runs to score on a walk, wild pitch and double."

His fastball sits in the 89-92\u00a0mph range and he offers a two-seam variety in addition to the traditional four-seam version. His best pitch is the slider, a two-plane breaking ball he can paint on the corner versus right-handed batters and sweep away from lefties in the 79-81\u00a0mph range. His low-to-mid 70s curveball is a weapon in any count and his 82-84\u00a0mph changeup has shown the most improvement as Anderson has fought his way through injuries. Over the course of his career, Anderson's arm slot has lowered slightly, dropping from high three-quarters to true three-quarters. He's athletic and repeats his mechanics, aiding in his ability to command his entire arsenal. Anderson is considered an \"extreme ground ball pitcher\" with a ground ball rate of 58.2% -- second highest of all starting pitchers, since his career began in 2009."

He then dropped into non\u2013league football, finishing as Caernarfon Town's leading scorer in 1981\u201382. Morris then had a spell with Bangor City during 1983\u201384 in the Alliance Premier League.

Morris returned to Chester in the summer of 1984 and he made a belated Football League debut at the age of 30 as a substitute against Colchester United. This proved to be his only appearance in his second spell at Chester and he returned to Bangor. He was also heavily involved in local league football in Chester and worked as a stonemason at Chester Cathedral.  He was murdered outside his home in Chester on New Year's Eve 1998."

He also amassed a total of 35 caps for the Northern Ireland national football team. Following his playing career, he went into management, taking charge of various clubs in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Jackson began his professional football career playing for Glentoran. He became a regular in the Glentoran side by the age of 21, and won league-winners' medals in 1967 and 1968 before signing for Everton in February 1968. In just over two seasons with the Toffees, Jackson picked up yet another league-winners' medal in 1970. His performances as understudy to the likes of Alan Ball and Howard Kendall attracted the attention of other clubs and, after just 32 league appearances for Everton, Jackson was signed by Nottingham Forest in October 1970. Forest were struggling for survival in the First Division, but Jackson still only managed to make 81 appearances, albeit scoring six goals. The arrival of Brian Clough and the emergence of Martin O'Neill saw Jackson's opportunities become even fewer and further between, and he was granted a free transfer in the summer of 1975. He was then signed by Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty with the intention of Jackson captaining the club's reserve team and instilling a level of professionalism in the club, which had just been promoted back into the First Division. However, Jackson made such a good impression that he was rewarded with 17 league starts that season, helping the team to an impressive third-place finish. Nevertheless, he spent the 1976\u201377 season back in his intended reserve team role before retiring back to Ireland to become the player-manager at Waterford United. There, he led the club to two consecutive FAI Cup finals, winning the competition in 1980. Despite the FAI Cup win, one trophy in four years was not enough for the Waterford United board, and Jackson was sacked in 1982. It was a whole year before he got another management job, returning to Northern Ireland as manager of Crusaders in July 1983. The team won the Gold Cup in 1985, beating Linfield 2\u20131 in the final, but Jackson left the club in October of the following season, before returning to his first club, Glentoran, three months later. In  years at Glentoran, Jackson led the team to 16 major trophies, including the Double in 1988, but the team's form began to dip after their title win in 1992, and Jackson was sacked in July 1993. He then spent a further year in charge of Ballymena United."

Competing against rookie Austin Rehkow for a roster spot, Hauschka won the competition on August 20. His kicking style, involving low line-drive kicks (which was one of the reasons the Seahawks, who preferred someone with a higher kick trajectory, did not re-sign him), was considered one of his strengths for Buffalo, as the greater power a line-drive kick can counteract windy conditions. On September 10, 2017, in the season-opening 21\u201312 victory over the New York Jets, Hauschka made his debut as a Bill. He converted three extra points in the win. In Week 3, Hauschka went 4-for-4 on field goals, including a 55-yarder, and converted all extra-point attempts, earning him AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. The following week, he was a perfect 3-for-3 on field goals including a tie-breaking 56-yarder in a 23\u201317 win over the Falcons, earning him his second straight AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Hauschka broke the NFL record for most consecutive field goals made from 50 yards or beyond after he made a 50-yard field goal against the Los Angeles Chargers on November 19, 2017. In Week 10 of the 2018 season, Hauschka made all seven of his kicks, five extra points and two field goals, including a season-long 54-yarder, in a 41\u201310 win over the New York Jets, earning him AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. During the rematch against the Jets in week 14, Hauschka was hit in the back by Jets defensive end Henry Anderson following a blocked field goal attempt, suffering an injured hip on the play. On August 28, 2019, Hauschka signed a two-year, $8\u00a0million contract extension with the Bills. On August 27, 2020, Hauschka was released by the Bills after the team selected Tyler Bass in the 2020 draft."

        "content": "Everton had finished in a disappointing eighth position in the inaugural Football League season, having scored only 35 goals and the directors \"were determined to improve upon their indifferent performances\", especially in front of the goal, by recruiting Geary, along with Scotsman Alex Latta (from Dumbarton) and Welshman Charlie Parry (from Chester St Oswalds). Geary had first been spotted at Grimsby Town, but had moved back to Notts Rangers before he was persuaded to join Everton. Geary was described as \"small and powerful\", standing at barely  and weighing . He relied on his pace and acceleration to get away from defenders and, according to the Liverpool Echo,  \"his team-mates complained that he was sometimes too quick, leaving the ball or his strike partners behind with his turbo-charged bursts\". Geary made his Football League debut for Everton on 7 September 1889 at home (then at Anfield) to Blackburn Rovers and scored twice in a 3\u20132 victory. He soon began to form a prolific scoring partnership with Latta, well supported by Edgar Chadwick and Alf Milward, and later in the season by Alexander Brady. Geary scored regularly throughout the season, including a hat-trick in an 8\u20130 demolition of Stoke City on 4 November. He ended the season with 21 league goals in 18 matches, as Everton finished runners-up, two points behind Preston North End. Geary had also scored four FA Cup goals, including a hat-trick in an 11\u20132 victory over Derby County on 18 January (with three goals also from Milward and Brady). This remains Everton's highest margin of victory in any competition. On 15 March 1890, Geary was called up by the England selectors to play against Ireland in the 1890 British Home Championship. England also played against Wales on the same day, and the selectors picked a mainly amateur team to play at Wrexham (winning 3\u20131), while the players selected for the match against the Irish at Ballynafeigh Park, Belfast were mainly professional, including five players from Blackburn Rovers. England easily overcame the Irish by a 9\u20131 margin, with Geary scoring a hat-trick, and a pair each from William Townley and Kenny Davenport. The Irish goal was scored by Jack Reynolds, who later played for England. According to Cris Freddi, \"a (not altogether coherent) match report in The Field credits Geary with four goals, and a (very confused) summary in The Athletic News maintains that 'the clever little Everton centre was responsible for five of the goals, and beauties they were'.\" Despite the margin of victory, the England selectors did not use any of the team that defeated the Irish for the next match against Scotland, preferring the team that had played against Wales. The match against Scotland was a 1\u20131 draw, and, thus, England and Scotland shared the 1890 British Home Championship title. Geary started the 1890\u201391 season in superb form, scoring in each of the first six matches as Everton started the season with five straight victories. By mid-January, Everton had completed all but one of their fixtures and were on 29 points, while Preston North End were eleven points adrift with seven games still to play. Everton than had to sit out the next two months as Preston completed their fixture list until they were only two points adrift with one match each left to play. Both teams played their final games of the season on 14 March, with Everton losing 3\u20132 at Burnley (Geary scored both Everton goals) and Preston going down 3\u20130 at Sunderland. Everton were thus able to win the Football League Championship for the first time, by a margin of two points with fourteen victories from their 22 league games. Geary had been ever-present, and was the club's top goal-scorer with 21 goals. Geary earned his second (and last) England cap for the match against Scotland on 6 April 1891. Although the match was played at Ewood Park, Blackburn, not one Blackburn player was selected, with the selectors opting for four players from Everton's championship winning team, with Geary lining up alongside Edgar Chadwick and Alf Milward (with Johnny Holt in defence). In a close game, England managed to hold on to a 2\u20131 victory with goals from John Goodall (Derby County) and Chadwick. Geary started the 1891\u201392 season well, with four goals from the first five games until injury put him out of action for several months, with Alan Maxwell taking his place. Geary was able to return for the last five games of the season, scoring twice more as Everton ended the season in fifth place. In the summer of 1892, Everton move out of their original home at Anfield after John Houlding, the leaseholder of the stadium, purchased the ground outright and proposed increasing the rent from \u00a3100 to \u00a3250 per year. Everton, who had played at Anfield for seven years, refused to meet his demands and moved to Goodison Park. Geary scored the first goal at the new stadium in a friendly against Bolton Wanderers to celebrate the opening. The first league game at Goodison Park took place on 3 September 1892 with Nottingham Forest supplying the opposition. The game ended in a 2\u20132 draw with the honour of scoring the first competitive goal at Goodison going to Forest's Horace Pike, with the first Everton goal coming from Geary. The team's first league victory at their new ground came in the next home game when they crushed Newton Heath 6\u20130, with Geary and Chadwick each scoring twice. Geary failed to score for the next six games, before he and Alex Latta each scored hat-tricks in a 6\u20131 victory over Derby County on 5 November. Geary ended the league season as the club's top scorer (for the third time in four seasons) with 19 goals from 24 league appearances, as Everton finished third in the league table. Geary played in the first three matches of the FA Cup run, scoring four goals before a leg injury resulted in him missing the semi-final against Preston North End. Everton eventually defeated Preston after a second replay to set up a final against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Although Geary was now fit, he was not picked for the Final to be played at Fallowfield, Manchester on 25 March, with Alan Maxwell retaining his place at centre-forward. Wolves won the match with a goal from their captain, Harry Allen, as the Everton forwards were unable to break down Wolves' defence. Injury prevented Geary making an appearance at the start of the 1893\u201394 season, and he lost his place at centre-forward to Jack Southworth who had arrived from Blackburn Rovers during the summer. Geary's first game of the season was against Burnley on 25 November 1893, when he scored in a 4\u20133 victory. He retained his place for the next two matches, before Southworth returned to the side. Geary completed the season having played only nine matches, scoring eight goals. The season ended with Everton in a disappointing sixth place, with Southworth top scorer in the Football League with a tally of 27 goals from just 22 games. Injury again kept Geary out of the team until January 1895, and he was only able to make eight appearances with four goals in his final season at Goodison Park. His final appearance came on 13 April 1895, when he scored in a 2\u20133 defeat to Derby County. In his Everton career, he made 99 appearances in league and cup matches, scoring 86 goals."

He remained at The Dell for a further two years, playing in the reserves but failing to break into the first team, before a free transfer to Cambridge United in March 1988. He remained with the club until December of that year when he made a move to Scunthorpe United on a free transfer. He spent the next four years playing for \"The Iron\", and eventually his performances earned him a move to West Bromwich Albion in 1992 for \u00a3160,000. While with \"The Baggies\", Hamilton played under manager Alan Buckley. In 1998 Albion sold Hamilton to Sheffield United for \u00a3325,000 and he would remain at Bramall Lane for the next two seasons. While at United, he was re-signed by Alan Buckley at fellow First division side Grimsby Town. Hamilton played six times for \"The Mariners\", scoring once in his one-month loan spell. At the end of the 1999\u201300 campaign, following his release from United, Hamilton signed for Notts County on a two-year deal.

He scored his first and what turned out to be only goal for Lincoln against Leyton Orient in the FA Cup. He was part of the squad that was nearly relegated out of the Football League.

He pitched 5 innings for the win against the Chicago White Sox, allowing three runs (one earned) on four hits and two walks, striking out four. Bergesen's starts for the next month would be much rockier, as his ERA quickly increased and sat at 5.49 after a start on May 24. Bergesen's year turned around dramatically at this point. From May 29 through July 30 (a span of 12 starts), he pitched at least six innings each start and allowed more than three earned runs only once. He had a particularly impressive stretch from May 29 to June 14, when over four starts he pitched 32 innings and allowed just six runs (an ERA of only 1.69). The start on June 14 was his first career complete game, an 11-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves. Bergesen continued to pitch well over the course of the year, emerging as the Orioles' most dependable starting pitcher as the summer continued. Unfortunately for the Orioles, his final start would be on July 30, against the Kansas City Royals. Bergesen was pitching another solid game, having allowed only one run thus far, and was one out away from getting out of a jam in the seventh inning when the Royals' Billy Butler hit a line drive straight into Bergesen's left shin. Bergesen collapsed immediately upon being hit, and the ball rolled back towards Orioles catcher Matt Wieters, who threw Butler out at first. Bergesen managed to get up quickly, slap gloves with Wieters, and hobble into the Orioles' dugout unassisted before collapsing in the tunnel. X-rays and an MRI did not reveal any bone fracture, but the injury would end Bergesen's season. Bergesen finished the 2009 season with 19 starts, 123 innings pitched, a WHIP of 1.28, and an ERA of 3.43. Many writers have suggested that if Bergesen had continued to pitch as well as he had and had not been injured, he would have been a strong candidate for Rookie of the Year. On April 20, 2010, Bergesen was optioned to Norfolk. On May 14, 2011, Bergesen threw a complete game shutout of the Tampa Bay Rays. Bergesen did not allow a single base hit throughout the last six innings of the game. It was his fourth career complete game, but it was his first complete game shutout of his career. On May 29, 2011, Bergesen was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk, giving up his spot in his rotation to Brian Matusz. In June, he returned to MLB in a relief role in exchange for Jeremy Accardo. Bergesen was designated for assignment on May 12, 2012. He was later re-added to the 40-man roster, but was designated for assignment again on July 18."

He failed to record an appearance in his first year, but by his second year he was a stalwart in the midfield and was named team captain by manager Garry Thompson. However soon after Thompson left the club, Hogg saw his time dwindle until he was eventually released by the club in the summer of 2003. In total, Hogg appeared in 74 league games, scoring 3 times for the Pirates. He also made 17 additional cup appearances, scoring an additional 3 goals, including a memorable equaliser at Goodison Park against Premier League side Everton in the League Cup. After leaving Bristol Rovers, Hogg found his way to Barnet where he appeared 16 times in half a season, scoring for them once against Leigh Genesis F.C. While with Barnet, Hogg represented England at the non-league level. Hogg was quickly on the move again, joining Conference South side Weston-super-Mare in December 2003. He quickly found himself as a midfield force for The Seagulls and spent two and a half years at Woodspring Stadium. It came with much surprise that Hogg wanted to move to Bath City in the summer of 2006, dropping down a league in the process. After the clubs were unable to agree on a fee, an independent tribunal decided on a \u00a34000 fee to be paid to Weston-super-Mare for Hogg's signature. Once at Bath City, Hogg was a hit. Despite having a less than stellar disciplinary record, Hogg has proven to be quite a pickup for the Twerton Park side. In his first season with Bath City, he saw the team promoted to the Conference South. His former club Weston-super-Mare took notice of \"the one that got away\" as well, putting in a \u00a32,000 bid on New Year's Eve 2008 for the midfielder, which Bath manager Adie Britton rejected. He departed Bath following the club's relegation to the Conference South after signing for Gloucester City of the Conference North in June 2012. After leaving Gloucester joined Mangotsfield United in 2014, briefly serving as caretaker manager in 2015. He left to join Yate in 2016, before returning to Mangotsfield."

He played as a wing half. Wallington was born in the Small Heath district of Birmingham, and lived in St Andrew's Road, adjacent to Birmingham F.C.'s St Andrew's ground. A pupil of Ada Road School, Wallington played for the Birmingham Schools representative team that reached the final of the English Schools' Football Association Trophy in 1923. He signed for Birmingham from Wolseley Motors in 1928, and played for their junior teams in a variety of positions before making his debut in the First Division on 30 April 1932, the penultimate game of the 1931\u201332 season, in a 4\u20130 home win against Chelsea. Though his performance received a favourable report\u00a0\u2013 the Birmingham Mail described his excellent ball control and felt that \"one saw enough of him to justify the conclusion that he understands the defensive duties of a wing half-back equally well\"\u00a0\u2013 Birmingham's next game was Wallington's last for the club. The following year he joined Bristol Rovers, where he played 94 league games in four seasons and helped them win the Football League Third Division South Cup in 1935. He went on to Worcester City, where he also acted as manager during the 1937\u201338 season, and finished his career at Cradley Heath St Luke's. Wallington died in his native Birmingham in December 1989 at the age of 81."

After his second season, his family moved to Raleigh, where he repeated his sophomore year at Needham B. Broughton High School. Despite having a very impressive tryout, Wall was cut from the school's varsity team for attitude-related issues. For this reason, he transferred to Word of God Christian Academy, also in Raleigh. It was there that Wall set about the reform of his attitude and related issues. Coach Levi Beckwith worked with Wall, first to stop demeaning his teammates for missed layups, and later to improve his facial expressions and general demeanor. On the heels of his second sophomore year of high school, in the summer of 2007, Wall was invited to the prestigious Reebok All-American Camp in Philadelphia; there, he distinguished himself by scoring 28 points against a team that featured future lottery pick Brandon Jennings. In 2008, Wall played in the Elite 24 Hoops Classic, at which he scored 10 points and won co-MVP honors alongside Dominic Cheek, Maalik Wayns, and Lance Stephenson. As a fifth-year senior in 2009, Wall averaged 19.7 points, 9 assists, and over 8 rebounds for Word of God Christian Academy and was ranked one of the best high school basketball players in the class of that year. He led the Holy Rams basketball team all the way to the North Carolina Class 1A state championship; they were ultimately defeated by United Faith Christian Academy 56\u201353, but not before that school's Ian Miller hit a 40 foot game-clinching jump shot at the buzzer. Wall scored 11 points in the contest. He was selected to participate in the 2009 Nike Hoop Summit in Portland, Oregon; he scored 13 points to go along with 11 assists and 5 steals at the high-profile event. He was also selected to play in the Jordan Brand Classic that year at Madison Square Garden, where he notched 6 assists."

        "content": "Wall is known for being one of the NBA's fastest players. His results at the draft combine of 10.84 seconds in the lane agility drill (combine best that year) and 3.14 seconds in the 3/4 court sprint (second-best that year), demonstrating horizontal and vertical quickness. Despite only being a point guard-average  listed height in shoes and  barefoot, Wall has a  wingspan, slightly larger than the average for a point guard. Relying on his speed, Wall focuses on driving to the basket and sparking fast transition play. He is also a skilled passer, averaging over 10 assists a game for the 2014 through 2017 seasons, and 9.2 overall for his career. In the earlier stages of his time in the NBA, Wall was criticized for the amount of turnovers he committed, being dubbed \"very turnover prone\". While increasing his assist to turnover ratio in later years, Wall's TOPG has increased to 4.1, his mark at the conclusion of the 2017 season. Despite Wall's shooting percentages hovering slightly below league average except for free throw shooting (League average is .458/.364/.765 while Wall shoots .433/.321/.790), he has seen his shooting largely improve throughout his NBA career."

He then passed through Corinthians, before moving to Russia in 1996 to play for PFC CSKA Moscow. Leonidas was the first Brazilian to represent CSKA, making his debut for them on 3 August 1996, scoring direct from a free-kick in their 1-1 draw with Uralmash Yekaterinburg. He played alongside his compatriot Leandro Samarone, scoring six times in just nine league appearances, also playing four games in the 1996\u201397 UEFA Cup, in a season plagued by minor injuries. After a brief spell at Atl\u00e9tico Paranaense, Aleksandr Tarkhanov brought him to Torpedo Moscow in 1997, where he scored once in three games, but sustaining a severe injury afterwards, ending the season. Translator Andrew Tarasov would later comment on Leonidas in an interview in 2011: \"Leonidas was capricious person - the first foreigner he had. So he just came thinking he would be a king here, that Russians could not play football, only he could. But when he saw with his own eyes that in Russia there are other good players and he was just one in many, the discovery upset him and discouraged him. Any hard contact \u2013 and he began to squeal and squeak. Plus life was very difficult for him, in part, of course, because 1996 Moscow was not what is today. There were few supermarkets, which he loved. Therefore, Leonidas seem to think that all in Russia was bad. And if a person is impossible to work on in football, it naturally transfers to everyday life.\" Released by Torpedo, he returned to Brazil and to Corinthians Alogoano, staying just a few months, before signing with Benfica in July 1997. He made his debut on 13 September 1997, in a home draw against Acad\u00e9mica, replacing Jorge Soares at half-time. Failing to make an impression, he played a last game on 21 December, already with Graeme Souness in charge, and left in the transfer market to join FC Arsenal Tula. His second spell in Russia was short lived, playing just six games in the 1998 Russian Top Division. In 2000\u201301, he joined Levski Sofia, playing three Europeans games in the 2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds, twice against F91 Dudelange and once against Be\u015fikta\u015f.

In February 2015, he was signed by Chelsea, but after playing sparingly, was loaned to Juventus for consecutive seasons, where he won successive Serie A and Coppa Italia titles. He joined the club permanently in 2017, and added a third consecutive domestic double the following season, followed by a two more consecutive league titles and a Supercoppa Italiana over the next two seasons.

I know Italy and I know the difference between Italy and England; his formation, his development, his experience \u2013 everything was in Italy.\" Five days after signing, Cuadrado made his Chelsea debut after replacing Willian for the last ten minutes of a 2\u20131 win away against Aston Villa. On 11 February, he made his first start in his first appearance at Stamford Bridge, playing the first 70 minutes before being replaced by Cesc F\u00e0bregas in a 1\u20130 win against Everton. He won his first Chelsea trophy on 1 March as the club defeated rival club Tottenham Hotspur 2\u20130 in the League Cup final, coming on in the 76th minute for Willian. On 3 May, Cuadrado made his only third start since his move to Chelsea, in the London derby match against Crystal Palace, as Ramires was taken ill before the game. At half-time, however, Cuadrado was substituted for Mikel John Obi; Chelsea ended up claiming their fifth league title with a 1\u20130 victory. Three weeks later, in the final match of the season against Sunderland, he won a penalty when fouled by John O'Shea, on which Diego Costa evened the score in an eventual 3\u20131 home win, but he was later substituted when he was injured in the final minute of the first half."

        "content": "On 25 August 2015, Cuadrado signed a season-long loan deal with Juventus for \u20ac1.5\u00a0million. He was issued squad number 16. Five days later, he made his debut, as a 75th-minute substitute in a 2\u20131 defeat away against Roma. On 31 October, Cuadrado scored his first Juventus goal against Torino to secure a 2\u20131 win in extra time at the end of the Derby della Mole. On 16 March 2016, Cuadrado scored his first ever UEFA Champions League goal in a 4\u20132 away defeat against Bayern Munich, in the second leg of the round of 16. On 21 May, he came off the bench to set-up \u00c1lvaro Morata's match-winning goal against Milan in the 110th minute of extra time of the 2016 Coppa Italia final, in Rome's Stadio Olimpico; Juventus' 1\u20130 victory enabled the club to secure the domestic double for the second consecutive season. Cuadrado returned to Chelsea on 30 June 2016 and played a few friendlies for Chelsea, including the 2016 International Champions Cup. On 31 August, however, Cuadrado returned to Juventus on a three-year loan for \u20ac5\u00a0million per season, plus a conditional obligation to buy the full registration rights of Cuadrado from Chelsea for an additional \u20ac20\u00a0million (or \u20ac15\u00a0million and \u20ac10\u00a0million in the second and the third year of loan respectively), after certain sports related achievements. Chelsea would also receive a maximum of \u20ac4\u00a0million bonuses, making the fee potentially raise to \u20ac29\u00a0million. He was assigned the number 7 shirt at this time. Cuadrado scored his first league goal in nine months on 5 February 2017, scoring the only goal in a 1\u20130 home win in a Derby d'Italia clash with Inter Milan. On 22 May 2017, it was announced that Cuadrado had joined Juventus on a permanent deal for a preset price of \u20ac20 million until 2020, after a clause in his contract had been triggered (winning the Serie A mathematically in round 37). In the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final against defending champions Real Madrid on 3 June, Cuadrado came on as a substitute for Andrea Barzagli in the 60th minute, but was later controversially sent off after picking up two yellow cards, the second for an alleged stamp on Sergio Ramos; Juventus lost the match 4\u20131. Following the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid in 2018, Cuadrado allowed Ronaldo to wear the number 7 shirt, with Cuadrado reverting to number 16, saying on Instagram \"It is better to give than to receive [...] Blessings to Cristiano in this new adventure\". On 21 September 2019, Cuadrado made his 100th Serie A appearance with Juventus in a 2\u20131 home win over Verona, during which he won a penalty which was converted by Cristiano Ronaldo. During the 2019\u201320 season, under the club's new manager Maurizio Sarri, Cuadrado was often deployed as an attacking right-back. On 3 November, he made his 150th appearance for the club in a 1\u20130 away win over cross-city rivals Torino in the Derby della Mole. Later that month, he extended his contract with the club until 2022. On 5 December 2020, Juventus won against Torino by a score margin of 2\u20131, where Cuadrado assisted both the goals. On 15 May 2021, he scored a brace in a 3\u20132 home victory over Inter Milan. On 5 December, Cuadrado scored an olympic goal in a 2\u20130 win against Genoa."

Cuadrado was in the Colombian squad which reached the quarter-finals of the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Argentina. His only appearance of the competition came in their last group match, a 2\u20130 victory over Bolivia in Santa Fe, replacing Fredy Guar\u00edn after 50 minutes. Cuadrado was named in Colombia's 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the third group stage match, a 4\u20131 victory against Japan, he scored the team's opening goal on a penalty kick. He would end his World Cup campaign with four assists, tying Toni Kroos as the competition's assist leader. Cuadrado played every minute of Colombia's run to the quarter-finals of the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Chile, and scored in their penalty shootout defeat against Argentina.

        "title": "Juan Cuadrado_Style of play",
        "content": "Cuadrado is known for his direct, offensive style of play along the right flank, and is capable of both scoring goals himself, courtesy of his striking ability from distance, as well as creating goalscoring opportunities for his teammates. He is capable of playing both as a wide midfielder, or as a winger in an attacking trident, due to his ability to make attacking runs down the wing. He often utilises his speed, flair, and technical skills to beat opponents in one on one situations and create space and time for him to shoot on goal, or deliver crosses to strikers in the area. Due to his playing style, which frequently involves taking on full-backs on the flank, and subsequently running towards the touch-line to deliver balls into the area, he has been labelled one of the few \"traditional\" wide midfielders in the current game. Tim Vickery, a reporter on South American football, stated that as Colombia's defensive players played near the goal in order to cover for veteran centre-back Mario Yepes, Cuadrado's pace, agility, creativity and dribbling ability on the right wing moved the team forward at the 2014 World Cup. Vickery also added that, in addition to his main role on the wing, Cuadrado is also adept as an attacking right back or wing back, due to his energy and work rate, as well as his other aforementioned qualities; he has also been used in this position more recently at Juventus, under managers Massimiliano Allegri, Maurizio Sarri, and Andrea Pirlo. A versatile player, he is also capable of playing on the left, a position which allows him to cut into the middle and shoot on goal with his stronger, right foot. In his early career, he was initially deployed as central or defensive midfielder, and was even deployed as an outright forward or striker; he is also capable of playing as an attacking midfielder, or as a second striker on occasion, and has even been used as a more offensive-minded central midfielder at times, known as the mezz'ala role, in Italian (which literally translates to \"half-winger\"). Despite his talent and ability, Cuadrado's decision-making and reading of the game have been criticised at times in the media; moreover, he has also drawn criticism at times from some in the sport for being inconsistent, and for having an overly individualistic playing style. In 2017, Mina Rzouki of ESPN FC noted that \"Cuadrado has yet to learn the art of making decisive runs on a consistent basis. Still naive and capable of slowing down a game despite his pace, he does not boast the football intelligence of a world-beater.\""

On 11 September 2016, during the 5\u20130 home win against Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr in the second matchday of the 2016\u201317 Albanian Superliga season, Shehaj scored the fifth goal of the match, his first league strike since April 2015. It was also his 200th appearance in all competitions for the club. Later on 18 December, Shehaj scored the lone goal in the home match against La\u00e7i by finishing home a Bruno Telushi cross, leading the team to their third league win in their last five matches. It was Flamurtari's first home over La\u00e7i in six years. Following the end of 2016\u201317 season where Flamurtari barely avoided relegation by just one point, Shehaj confirmed that he was going to stay at the club for the next season as he was in coach Shp\u00ebtim Duro's plans. However, one month later, on 14 July 2017, Shehaj was sold to Teuta Durr\u00ebs, signing a two-year contract, leaving Flamurtari after ten years of service. His debut on 9 September brought his first goal for the club as well, as his late header was the winner for Teuta who defeated Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr in the opening week of the championship. In January 2018, Shehaj joined Flamurtari Prishtina in the Football Superleague of Kosovo."

He assisted Ram\u00f3n N\u00fa\u00f1ez' first goal in a 3\u20132 victory against Bradford City in the League Cup. Having come close to scoring his first Leeds goal with \"the most audacious of attempts from distance which almost caught out\" Middlesbrough's goalkeeper, Carl Ikeme, on 13 August, he succeeded a week later with a late equaliser against West Ham United; the Yorkshire Evening Post had suggested that facing an opposing midfield as strong as West Ham's would be \"the essence of an acid test\" for any aspiring midfielder. By mid-September, he was reportedly attracting the interest of several Premiership clubs, but said he was hoping to stay at Leeds for \"a very long time\". His third goal of the season came against his former club Peterborough United on 22 October, and the matchwinner against Leicester City on 6 November, when \"a loose ball fell to Clayton who connected first time to send a  curler into the top corner past a helpless Schmeichel\", earned him the club's Goal of the Season award. In April 2012, Clayton received a two-match ban for accumulating ten yellow cards over the course of the season. After his first season as a regular and with one year left on his contract, Clayton told the press that he was discussing an extension and hoped to stay on at Leeds. Terms could not be agreed, and he was one of six senior players transfer-listed by Neil Warnock, who explained that no player would leave unless the club received a suitable offer, and if Clayton did not leave, he would be welcome to fight for his place in 2012\u201313."

He was handed the number 8 shirt, previously worn by Jacob Butterfield who signed for Huddersfield in the swap deal. Adam Clayton became an integral player in the Middlesbrough midfield under manager Aitor Karanka, forming a formidable partnership alongside club captain Grant Leadbitter. On 7 May 2016, Clayton won promotion to the Premier League with Middlesbrough after a 1\u20131 draw at home against Brighton & Hove Albion. With the arrival of Marten de Roon in the summer of 2016, it was reported that Clayton and Leadbitter could leave Middlesbrough, though they both stayed, as Karanka promised the midfield duo game time in the Premier League. Despite their efforts, the club were immediately relegated back down to the Championship for the 2017\u201318 season. Garry Monk replaced Karanka as manager for the forthcoming Championship season, and brought in two new central midfielders Lewis Baker and Jonny Howson, though Clayton continued to play regular first team football. However, the club failed to meet their league expectations, with them placed just below the play-off positions, Monk was sacked, to be replaced by Tony Pulis shortly afterwards. When Karanka returned to management with a poor-performing Nottingham Forest side, it was reported that Karanka was looking to sign his former Middlesbrough stars, including Clayton, Leadbitter and Patrick Bamford. However, they all pledged their loyalty and commitment to Middlesbrough and stayed at the Riverside, though fellow Middlesbrough midfielder Adl\u00e8ne Guedioura left to return to Forest, one of his former clubs. Having failed to agree to a new contract, Clayton confirmed his departure through social media, with the club also reporting the news the following day: new manager Neil Warnock had informed him that he was not needed at the club and he departed on holiday on the same day as the final game of the Championship season."

Despite his offensive and creative prowess, he was inconsistent at times, however, and was less effective defensively, as he often struggled in one on one situations with forwards. A predominantly left-footed player, he was also an accurate free-kick taker. Although he was often a reserve player at Milan and Juventus, Orlando is one of the six players to win the Serie A title in two successive years with different clubs, winning the 1993\u201394 Serie A title with Milan, and the 1994\u201395 Serie A title with Juventus; the other five are Giovanni Ferrari, Riccardo Toros, Eraldo Mancin, Roberto Baggio, and Andrea Pirlo."

As his old teammate Doug Flutie was heading into town with the rest of the New England Patriots in November, 1988, Galvin was quoted by the New York Times reporter Gerald Eskenazi; ...The way John Galvin talked about Doug Flutie, the little guy the Jets will face Sunday seemed almost human. He's not the player he was in college, said Galvin, who played with Flutie at Boston College. He took over a game in college. Sometimes I didn't even know if he needed the rest of the team. This anticipation that something spectacular can happen at any moment has surrounded Flutie in the pros. Galvin should know. He was in the Orange Bowl, where Flutie outdueled Bernie Kosar and threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to Gerald Phelan as time expired for a 47\u201345 victory over Miami... The Jets kept New England scoreless in the first half, but eventually lost 14\u201313. In his one year with the Minnesota Vikings in 1989, he had 7 special teams tackles. The New York Times describes Galvin's trade back to the Jets for the 1990 season;Galvin a Jet Again John Galvin, a linebacker who was a special-teams player for the Jets in 1988, rejoined the club Saturday after he was waived by the Minnesota Vikings, with whom he spent last season. Galvin played for Boston College for four years, and wound up there as the starting right outside linebacker. That is a position that has proved hardest to fill for the Jets this summer. The club's new linebacker coach is Monte Kiffin, who coached Galvin last year with the Vikings. Galvin's immediate role will probably will be on special teams and as a backup linebacker. In 1990, he led the New York Jets team with 21 coverage tackles, with a season high of 4 tackles in week 1 vs. Cincinnati Bengals, and earned the game ball in week 15 vs. New England Patriots with 3 tackles. In Galvin's 1991 season with the Jets, he played in 9 games, and recorded one fumble recovery. In his 4-year, 52-game NFL career, he had two fumble recoveries."

He was then drafted in 2002, in round 1 (#9 overall) by the Lincoln Stars in the USHL Entry Draft. Reese was drafted 209th overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Rangers. He played collegiate hockey with Harvard of the ECAC where he won two conference championships as well as made three NCAA tournament appearances. After missing 15 games his freshman season, including the 2004 World Junior Championships due to a back injury, Reese bounced back to have an outstanding sophomore campaign in 2004\u201305. He led all Crimson defensemen in scoring with 19 points (7 goals, 12 assists) playing in all 34 games that season. Reese, who played alongside senior Ryan Lannon for nearly the entire year, was a member of one of the best defensive corps in the nation. He went on to lead Harvard defensemen in scoring each of the next two seasons while being named team captain and MVP his senior year. In both 2005-2006 and in 2006-2007 he was an NCAA (ECAC) Second All-Star Team. Reese made his professional debut in the 2007\u201308 season with the Phoenix Coyotes affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage of the AHL. He played in 59 games, but his contributions were minimal as he was often scratched in favor of veteran defensemen Travis Roche, Bryan Helmer and Brendan Bell. In the 2008\u201309 season, Reese's ice time was increased significantly as he was again paired with former Harvard teammate Ryan Lannon on the back end. Although the Rampage remained near the bottom of the pack all season Reese showed significant development as he contributed 28 points and played regularly in all situations. In the summer of 2009 Reese received a contract with the Columbus Blue Jackets after attending their camp on a tryout basis. He was immediately assigned to Columbus' American League affiliate the Syracuse Crunch. He played in 51 games for the Crunch scoring 22 points and recording a team best +12 rating. Then, on March 1, two days before the NHL trade deadline Reese was dealt to the New York Islanders in exchange for Islanders forward Greg Moore. After reporting to the Islanders' AHL affiliate the Bridgeport Sound Tigers for one game, where he recorded a goal and an assist, Reese was recalled by the Islanders where he remained the rest of the season.

Reese began the 2010\u201311 AHL season with the Islanders' top AHL affiliate, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers, but on November 15, 2010 the defenseman was recalled to the NHL. After a single season within the Pittsburgh Penguins organization in the 2012\u201313 season, Reese opted to leave North America and sign with Russian club, Amur Khabarovsk in the KHL. He said of his experience: \"[Khabarovsk] is the coldest city. It was literally negative 20 for like one month straight; I\u2019m not kidding... People treated me well, but at the same time, I didn\u2019t understand what anyone was saying.\" On July 1, 2014, Reese returned to the NHL in signing a one-year two-way contract with the Arizona Coyotes. On July 18, 2016, as a free agent following the completion of his contract with the Coyotes, Reese left for abroad, agreeing to a one-year deal with Swedish club, HV71 of the SHL."

After becoming over-aged to play in the \u00c4ss\u00e4t Junior team, Rynn\u00e4s had serious trouble in finding himself a team, ending up in the Finnish 3rd division. However, \u00c4ss\u00e4t signed him for the 2009\u20132010 season and, after impressive performances in the pre-season games, Rynn\u00e4s got more and more responsibility and ended up becoming \u00c4ss\u00e4t's number one Liiga goaltender and a fan favourite. He had the top save percentage (.927) during the 2009\u201310 season, and posted a 2.47 goals against average. At the end of the season, several NHL teams showed interest, and Rynn\u00e4s chose Toronto. He and Brian Burke, president and general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs, agreed to terms on a two-year entry-level contract. He was recalled to the Toronto Maple Leafs on 27 March 2012 on an emergency basis due to the health of James Reimer. He made his first National Hockey League appearance in relief of Jonas Gustavsson that same night, against the Carolina Hurricanes.  On 29 March 2012 a game against the Philadelphia Flyers, Leafs starting goaltender Jonas Gustavsson was injured during a pre-game warmup in the knee.  Rynnas was informed by the coach Randy Carlyle that he was going to start the game.  Rynnas allowed 7 goals on 30 shots in his first NHL start, as the Flyers won 7\u20131. On 10 July 2013, Rynnas left the Maple Leafs organization as a free agent and returned to Finland signing a two-year contract with Oulun K\u00e4rp\u00e4t. In the 2013\u201314 campaign, he produced a banner season to again lead the league with a 1.51 goals against average and a .939 save percentage. On 7 July 2014, Rynn\u00e4s was released from the second year of his contract with K\u00e4rp\u00e4t and returned to the NHL in signing a two-year contract with the Dallas Stars. In the 2014\u201315 season with the Stars, Rynn\u00e4s lost out on the backup position to start the year and was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Texas Stars. He later appeared in 2 games with Dallas, before returning to Texas for the duration of the season. On 15 June 2015, it was announced that Rynnas had signed with Ak Bars Kazan of the KHL, after being placed on unconditional waivers by the Dallas Stars to forgo his final year of contract in North America. Rynn\u00e4s later returned to his native Finland and played three more seasons with Oulun K\u00e4rp\u00e4t in the Liiga, before leaving as a free agent following a finals defeat to HPK in the 2018\u201319 season. On 10 May 2019 Rynn\u00e4s opted to continue his European by signing a one-year contract with German outfit, Krefeld Pinguine of the DEL."

He most recently played for the Grizzlys Wolfsburg of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). A graduate of the University of North Dakota, Bina overcame a serious injury in his sophomore year to start his professional career in American minor league hockey in 2008. With the Las Vegas Wranglers in his second season, Bina developed an offensive talent that was rewarded with a starting position in the 2010 ECHL All-Star Game, although he chose to forgo the opportunity in favor of playing overseas. In Norway, he helped the Stavanger Oilers win their first ever title, the 2010 Norwegian Championship, and was named the most valuable player of the tournament. He was subsequently signed by Wolfsburg on a one-year contract."

        "content": "Robbie Bina, a native of Grand Forks, attended the University of North Dakota from 2003 to 2008. While there, he was a member of the university's Fighting Sioux ice hockey team (he also played American football and baseball), competing in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) of the NCAA. In his debut season, Bina led the Fighting Sioux rookie defensemen with eight points in 31 games, scoring the first goal of his college hockey career against the Denver Pioneers on November 21, 2003. In the Semi-final of the 2005 WCHA playoffs against Denver, Bina sustained a career-threatening injury during a delayed penalty call against North Dakota. Having reached for the puck to stop play, he was hit illegally from behind by Denver winger Geoff Paukovich, causing him to crash into the boards and break his neck. Paukovich, who was \"deeply regretful\" about the incident, initially received a two-minute minor penalty for boarding, but was later given a one-game suspension by the NCAA and another from his coach, George Gwozdecky. Bina underwent surgery to repair a shattered vertebra and was out for the remainder of the WCHA and NCAA tournaments (in which the Fighting Sioux reached the Final of the Frozen Four), as well as the entire 2005\u201306 season. Having fully recovered from his injury, Bina returned with a more offensive game in 2006\u201307, recording 10 goals and 22 assists in 43 games and helping his team reach their third consecutive Frozen Four. With 32 points in the season, he ranked first among the Fighting Sioux defensemen and fourth overall; on a national level he ranked fifteenth among defensemen in points per game. He scored two short handed goals, including one from 170 feet out against Minnesota. In the 2007\u201308 season, his senior year, Bina recorded two goals and 23 assists in 43 games, including a career high three assists against Colorado College on November 2, 2007, and was ranked second overall in terms of number of assists. North Dakota made the Frozen Four yet again, and Bina was named to the WCHA All-Academic team for the second year in a row."

        "content": "Upon graduating from the University of North Dakota, Robbie Bina signed his first professional contract with the Edmonton Oilers organization in July 2008, a one-year, two-way deal with affiliates, the Springfield Falcons of the AHL and Stockton Thunder of the ECHL. Appearing at the Edmonton training camp in September, he was \"reunited\" with Geoff Paukovich, who had played for Stockton since 2007. Having never spoken to each other about the incident until then, the two settled their differences quickly, becoming close teammates and friends. Bina ended up splitting the season between the AHL and ECHL, with similar results on each level: eight points in 37 games with the Falcons and eight points in 28 games with the Thunder. He enjoyed a solid postseason, scoring six points in 14 games with the Thunder, who were eventually eliminated in the Division Finals. A free agent, Bina moved to Las Vegas ahead of the 2009\u201310 season, joining the Las Vegas Wranglers of the ECHL. Having produced only modest offensive results during his rookie season, he was given the chance by Wranglers coach Ryan Mougenel to show off more of his playmaking potential, to which he responded positively. \"He's never been put in that role as someone who can be counted on for offensive output. That's what he needed... He just skates so well. He's got great wheels and great vision. He creates that second wave of attack, which actually ends up paying dividends.\" Bina scored three goals and made 11 assists in 14 games; on November 17, he was signed to a professional try-out with affiliates San Antonio Rampage of the AHL, but was released on December 7 after making only two appearances. Back in Las Vegas, Bina continued where he had left off, picking up another goal and three assists before the end of 2009, placing him near the top of the points standings among defensemen in the league. On December 31 he was selected as a starter in the 2010 ECHL All-Star Game. \"It's great to be chosen... There are going to be a lot of great players and I'm lucky to be there, it's an exciting thing.\" Two weeks later, however, Bina left the Wranglers to play in Europe, thereby missing out on what would have been the first all-star game appearance of his career. On January 15, the Stavanger Oilers of the Norwegian Eliteserien announced that they had acquired his services until the end of the season. Bina's stay in Norway was short but productive. With only 10 games left in the regular season, the American made little impact, with five points recorded in total, although Stavanger were able to advance from fifth to third place in the standings. Of far greater significance was his performance in the playoffs, where he scored four goals and made 16 assists to become the second leading points scorer. The Oilers knocked out L\u00f8renskog in the Quarter-finals and the Sparta Warriors in Semi-finals, eventually taking home their first ever Norwegian Championship title by defeating perennial favourites V\u00e5lerenga in six games in the Finals. Bina was named most valuable player by the Norwegian Ice Hockey Association for his efforts, and was also selected to the league's All-Star Team. Following the playoffs, the Oilers worked hard to get Bina on board for another season, but despite their best efforts, he elected instead to sign a one-year deal with the Grizzly Adams Wolfsburg of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. Having scouted Bina during the playoffs, Grizzlys general manager Karl-Heinz Fliegauf described him as a very good skater who acted intelligently on the ice, especially during power plays. Fliegauf also emphasized Bina's right-handed shot when making the decision to sign him."

After attending St. Rita of Cascia High School in Chicago, Illinois, he played college football for Northwestern, where he received second-team All-Big Ten Conference honors as a senior. He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL Draft, and spent six seasons in the NFL as a journeyman quarterback. Kafka became the quarterbacks coach for the Chiefs in 2018, and Patrick Mahomes, the starting quarterback for the Chiefs, earned the NFL Most Valuable Player award that season. Kafka helped the team win Super Bowl LIV the following season. Despite being the backup quarterback in 2008 for Northwestern, Kafka finished second on the team in rushing\u00a0yards with 321. Following C. J. Bach\u00e9r's graduation, Kafka became the starter for 2009. Against Syracuse, he set the school record for most consecutive pass completions with 16. In the same game, he became the first Big Ten Conference player to score a passing, receiving, and rushing touchdown since Zack Mills from Penn State in 2004. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. In the 2010 Outback Bowl against Auburn, Kafka set the all-time bowl record with 47 completions and 78 passing attempts. He set Northwestern and Outback Bowl records with 532 passing yards and an Outback Bowl record with five interceptions. Kafka spent two seasons as a member of the Eagles. In 2010, he was the third-string quarterback behind Michael Vick and Kevin Kolb but did not see playing time. He was mainly the third-string quarterback again in 2011 behind Vick and Vince Young, but saw some playing time in two games early in the season, both of which resulted in losses. He was expected to be the backup quarterback behind Vick in 2012 but a broken hand caused him to miss time in the preseason and was ultimately released in favor of rookie Nick Foles and veteran Trent Edwards. Kafka spent time on offseason rosters with the New England Patriots and Jacksonville Jaguars in 2013, on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' practice squad in 2014, on the preseason roster with the Minnesota Vikings in 2015, and on the practice squad for the Tennessee Titans and Cincinnati Bengals in 2015. Kafka became a graduate assistant with the Northwestern football team in 2016, and was hired by the Chiefs as an offensive quality control coach in 2017. He was promoted to quarterbacks coach in 2018, and helped the team win the Super Bowl during the 2019 season, his first as a player or coach. He was given an additional title of passing game coordinator in 2020. After the 2021 season, he joined the Giants as their offensive coordinator."

In his Northwestern career debut on September 1, 2006, against Miami University, Kafka threw for 106\u00a0yards and one touchdown on 13 completions out of 17 attempts. His first touchdown was a 19-yard pass to running back Tyrell Sutton. He led all players with 89\u00a0yards rushing on 17 rushing attempts. His passer rating for that game was 148.26 as Northwestern went on to win 21\u20133.  The following week against New Hampshire on September 9, Kafka went 19\u201332 and threw for 173\u00a0yards along with one interception and a fumble. He rushed for 42\u00a0yards. The Wildcats ended up losing the game, 34\u201317.  Kafka played the first half of the game against Eastern Michigan in the third week of the season and rushed for 33\u00a0yards with a 6.6\u00a0yards per run average, along with his first career rushing touchdown, a six-yard run. He passed for 76\u00a0yards and completed 10 out of 18 passes with an interception. Days before Northwestern faced Nevada in the fourth game of the season, head coach Pat Fitzgerald confirmed that Kafka would remain the starter despite his poor prior performances. In the game, Kafka ran for a career-high 111\u00a0yards, which included a 13-yard touchdown rush, and averaged 9.2\u00a0yards per run. He passed for 122\u00a0yards, completing 9 out of 21 passes and three interceptions. His 111\u00a0yards rushing were the most by a Northwestern quarterback since Zak Kustok ran for 111\u00a0yards in a November 21, 2001, game versus Bowling Green. Kafka suffered a hamstring injury during the game, which kept him out of the next three games of the season. One of the games he missed was the biggest comeback in NCAA Division I-A history, an eventual 41\u201338 loss to Michigan State on October 21.  Kafka made his first appearance since the injury against Ohio State on November 11, in which he passed for 17\u00a0yards and completed four out of eight passes. In 2007, Kafka was a backup and only played in two games, in which he passed for 11\u00a0yards on two completions and rushed for eight\u00a0yards."

Against Southern Illinois, he threw two passes, completing one for one yard, in addition to rushing for three\u00a0yards. He played in the final series at Indiana and completed a pass, which went for nine\u00a0yards. Starting in place of the injured Bach\u00e9r for the game against Minnesota, Kafka ran for 217\u00a0yards on 27 attempts, which included a 53-yard run, and passed for 143\u00a0yards and two touchdowns on 12 completions out of 16 throws. His 217 rushing\u00a0yards set a school and Big Ten Conference record for quarterback rushing\u00a0yards in a game.

He was named to the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award watch list, along with 19 other players nationally, with two others in the Big Ten Conference. Texas quarterback Colt McCoy eventually won the award. In the offseason, Kafka was tutored by offensive coordinator Mick McCall and former Northwestern quarterback Brett Basanez. Kafka was named co-captain for the 2009 season. At home against Towson on September 5 to start the 2009 season, Kafka threw 15-of-20 attempts for 192\u00a0yards, setting a career-high for passing yards in a game. He ran for six\u00a0yards on six carries in a blowout 47\u201314 win. Against Eastern Michigan at home on September 12, he threw for 158\u00a0yards and one interception on 14 completions out of 24 attempts. He ran for 21\u00a0yards on five runs in the close 27\u201324 win over the Eagles. During the Syracuse game, Kafka set a school record for consecutive completions in a game with 16, breaking the 47-year-old record set by Tom Myers in 1962. He set a new career-high in passing\u00a0yards in a game by passing for 390\u00a0yards, breaking his previous career-high in the season opener. Kafka also ran for a three-yard touchdown and threw three touchdown passes along with an interception. He caught a receiving touchdown when he tossed a lateral to Andrew Brewer who threw it back to Kafka for a 24-yard touchdown. Kafka became the first Big Ten Conference player to score at least one passing, receiving and rushing touchdown in a game since Zack Mills from Penn State accomplished it on September 4, 2004, against Akron. Kafka finished the game with 35 completions on 42 attempts. However, despite his record-breaking performance, the Wildcats lost 37\u201334. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week on September 20 for his performance. Kafka passed for 309\u00a0yards, two touchdowns and an interception against Minnesota. He took four sacks and during a desperation drive to win the game, fumbled the football, which helped end the game and give the Golden Gophers the win.  In the Purdue game, Kafka went 28-of-44 and threw for 224\u00a0yards. He rushed for a season-high 39\u00a0yards on 18 carries and ran for the game-winning two-yard touchdown. After leading after the touchdown 25\u201321, Kafka threw a successful two-point conversion pass to Drake Dunsmore to increase the lead by six to win the game after Purdue failed to score on the final drive of the game. Kafka went 15 completions of 31 attempts for 191\u00a0yards and one interception to lead Northwestern to a 16\u20136 win over Miami (OH) in the sixth game of the season. He was the leading rusher for Northwestern, rushing for 53\u00a0yards on 15 carries and two touchdowns.  In the 24\u201314 loss at Michigan State on October 17, Kafka went 34-for-47 and threw for 291\u00a0yards and two touchdowns. He was the leading rusher for the second straight week for Northwestern, rushing for 42\u00a0yards on 18 carries. In a come-from-behind win against Indiana, the Wildcats trailed 28\u20133 during the second quarter before Kafka ran for a one-yard touchdown and later passed for two touchdowns to lead Northwestern to a 29\u201328 win. The Wildcats overcame a 25-point deficit, which was the biggest comeback in school history. He went 26-of-46 and passed for 312\u00a0yards, along with two touchdowns and a career-tying three interceptions. He rushed for 65\u00a0yards on 17 carries and one touchdown. Kafka totaled 377\u00a0yards of total offense, which was second-best in his career.  Against 12th ranked Penn State, Kafka went 14-for-18 and passed for 128\u00a0yards, along with rushing for 42\u00a0yards on eight carries and a touchdown before leaving the game with a leg injury during the second quarter. He was replaced by backup Dan Persa. Kafka shared time at quarterback with Persa due to his strained hamstring on November 7 against the 4th-ranked, and previously undefeated, Iowa Hawkeyes. Northwestern coming into the game was a 16-point underdog, but still beat Iowa 17\u201310 in Northwestern's first win over a nationally ranked top-ten team since they won against Ohio State in 2004. Persa had to leave the game early to receive X-rays for a hand injury, which forced Kafka to play more than original planned. He finished as Northwestern\u2019s leading passer with 72\u00a0yards on ten completions. Against Illinois on November 14, Kafka threw for 305\u00a0yards and went 23-of-37, along with a 28-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Zeke Markshausen. He rushed seven times for 12\u00a0yards and a one-yard touchdown to beat the Fighting Illini 21\u201316. Kafka threw for 300 or more yards for the fourth time that season.   Against 16th-ranked Wisconsin on November 21, Kafka went 26-of-40 for 326\u00a0yards and two touchdowns, both to converted wide receiver Andrew Brewer. He rushed for 17\u00a0yards on seven carries to upset the Badgers with a 33\u201331 win. Kafka threw for 300 or more\u00a0yards for the fifth time in the season and for the second straight game. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against Wisconsin. Kafka ranked third in the Big Ten Conference in passing yards with 241.5 passing yards per game and he ranked second in total offense. He finished the season tied for first in the Big Ten in rushing touchdowns by a quarterback with seven. His 65.7 completion percentage for 2009 ranked first in the Big Ten. His 414 pass attempts ranked third in the Big Ten and eighth among all quarterbacks nationally. Kafka was named second-team All-Big Ten following the 2009 season. He was named first-team All-Big Ten by Rivals.com. He finished fourth in the Chicago Tribune's Silver Football voting, given out to the Big Ten's Most Valuable Player, behind Brandon Graham, Daryll Clark and John Clay.  Hall of Fame quarterback Bob Griese said Kafka \"has the three qualities I look for. One, he's a good decision-maker, he knows when to throw the ball away. Two, he's accurate. Three, he makes plays. This is where Kafka really jumps out. If he has a playmaker downfield, he gets the ball to him.\"  Kafka graduated from Northwestern in December. In the 2010 Outback Bowl against Auburn on January 1, Kafka set the all-time bowl record with 47 completions and 78 passing attempts. He set Northwestern and Outback Bowl records with 532 passing yards, a career-high. He set an Outback Bowl record with five interceptions. He tied the Outback Bowl record with four touchdown passes. His 98 plays and 566 total\u00a0yards were also Outback Bowl records. He threw four touchdown passes in the 38\u201335 loss that went to overtime, with two going to Andrew Brewer (39 and 35\u00a0yards), one to Drake Dunsmore for 66\u00a0yards, and one to Sidney Stewart for 18\u00a0yards. He finished second in rushing for Northwestern with 20 carries for 34\u00a0yards and a two-yard touchdown. He was named to ESPN.com's All-Big Ten Bowl team as an honorable mention. Kafka was named Northwestern's Most Valuable Player on offense following the season.  Kafka led the Big Ten in passing yards with 3,430\u00a0yards, total offense with 286.8\u00a0yards per game, completions with 24.5 per game, and fewest interceptions with 2.44 of all passes being intercepted. He was seventh nationally in completions, 16th in passing yards and 12th in total offensive yards.  His 3,430 passing\u00a0yards are third-most in school history. His 3,729 total offensive\u00a0yards are second-most in school history. In the 2010 East\u2013West Shrine Game on January 23, Kafka started at quarterback for the East squad and, despite a slow start, led the East squad to a comeback victory. On the final drive of the game, Kafka threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Penn State tight end Andrew Quarless to win the game for the East squad, 13\u201310. After the game, Kafka was named Offensive MVP after he went 18-of-27, passed for 150\u00a0yards and threw the winning touchdown pass."

        "content": "Prior to the 2010 NFL Draft, Kafka was projected to be drafted in the sixth round by NFLDraftScout.com and as high as the fourth round. He was rated as the eleventh-best quarterback in the draft. Northwestern head coach Pat Fitzgerald said at the time that 85 NFL scouts, general managers and personnel directors who watched film or came to see a game or a practice said about Kafka was that he \"throws a lot better than our No. 3 [quarterback] does right now.\" Fitzgerald also said that he would be \"shocked\" if Kafka was not drafted in the 2010 NFL Draft. After the Outback Bowl loss to Auburn on January 1, in which Kafka threw 78 passes for 532\u00a0yards, Fitzgerald said, \"I hope the NFL sees the same thing that I see, a man with a big-time arm.\" An NFL general manager said at the 2010 Senior Bowl that Kafka could be drafted as high as the third round. Kafka was invited to the 2010 NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, which started on February 24, along with teammates Corey Wootton and Sherrick McManis. Kafka chose Mike McCartney of Priority Sports of Chicago as his agent, who also represents Wootton. Priority hired former Chicago Bears quarterback Erik Kramer and a trainer in Phoenix, Arizona, to help Kafka prepare for the NFL Scouting Combine. To prepare for the Combine, Kafka worked out twice a day in Arizona, and held practice sessions with Notre Dame wide receiver Golden Tate. At the Combine, Kafka said, \"I want to be an NFL starter. I'm not going to the league to be a No. 2. I think my whole game can go to another level. I'm ready to take it up another notch.\" Kafka chose not to bench press at the NFL Combine. On February 28, Kafka answered 35 out of the 50 questions on the Wonderlic test, and was \"99 percent sure\" that he answered all 35 correctly. Draft analyst Mike Mayock said that Kafka was \"a developmental guy\" who should stay on a team's practice squad for a year. Kafka had some of the best measurements in the vertical jump, broad jump, 60-yard shuttle, and three-cone drill among all quarterbacks. At Northwestern's Pro Day on March 11, Kafka passed to his former teammates Andrew Brewer and Zeke Markshausen, and, according to Gil Brandt, only missed one pass during the entire workout. 25 NFL teams attended the workout, including the Cincinnati Bengals quarterbacks coach Ken Zampese and the Arizona Cardinals quarterback coach Chris Miller. Northwestern held its second Pro Day workout on March 29. He passed to his former teammates Brewer, Markshausen, and Brendan Mitchell during the workout. He was reportedly not as accurate on the second Pro Day as he was on the first, but still \"very accurate.\" 24 NFL team representatives attended the Pro Day. Kafka worked out for the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, and Oakland Raiders prior to the draft. Mike Mayock called Kafka the \"sleeper\" of the quarterback class, projecting him to be drafted in the sixth round. Mayock also said, \"He's a really smart kid. Has a better arm than people think. I don't even think he's sleeping anymore. He was a month-and-a-half ago, but he's on the rise. He's a kid who could surprise people at the end of the day.\" Former NFL quarterback Ron Jaworski concurred, saying that Kafka \"knows how to play the quarterback position. There's a real feel for hitting the open receiver, good anticipation. I can see him being one of those sleeper type guys.\" A scout before the draft said that Kafka \"throws a lot of picks, but at least he's willing to pull the trigger. You don't see that from a lot of young kids.\""

        "content": "Kafka was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fourth round (122nd overall) in the 2010 NFL Draft. He was the fifth quarterback taken in the draft, behind Sam Bradford (1st overall), Tim Tebow (25th overall), Jimmy Clausen (48th overall) and Colt McCoy (85th overall). Kafka was expected to be the team's third-string quarterback behind Kevin Kolb and Michael Vick. Eagles head coach Andy Reid said of Kafka, \"I think once you meet him, I think you'll see he's a smart guy. He has some of the intangible things \u2013 the leadership, he's a tough kid. Inner city, Chicago kid. He's got a little grit to him. I think that's important. You have to be wired right to handle you guys and play in the city of Philadelphia. I think he's wired right. He likes to compete.\" Kafka was signed to a four-year contract worth $2.256 million with $467,000 guaranteed on June 15, 2010. In the final practice of rookie and selected veterans training camp on July 29, Kafka took all the snaps at quarterback after Kolb and Vick got practice off. After practice, offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg said Kafka was \"the best rookie that I've ever had in 15, 16, 17 years or something like that. So, he's really sharp. Now, he's sharp book-wise, but he's also very intelligent in a football sense. He's really picked [the playbook] up very quickly.\" In the first preseason game on August 14 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Kafka went 3-for-7 for 76\u00a0yards and threw a 57-yard pass to wide receiver Chad Hall after taking over for Vick late in the third quarter. Kafka began the second preseason game on August 20 against the Cincinnati Bengals in the fourth quarter. He went 4-for-12 for 29\u00a0yards and two interceptions (both to cornerback Morgan Trent) with a passer rating of 2.4. He also had one carry for 24\u00a0yards. On August 27 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Kafka came into the game in the fourth quarter and went 9-for-13 for 93\u00a0yards and one touchdown. He led the Eagles on the winning drive with an 18-yard touchdown pass to Riley Cooper with 23 seconds left in the game to win, 20\u201317. In the final preseason game on September 2, Kafka replaced Vick during the second quarter and played for almost three quarters. He went 9-for-27 for 76\u00a0yards and an interception against the New York Jets. During the 2010 regular season and playoffs, Kafka was inactive as the team's third quarterback for all but five games. In week two Kafka was the backup to Vick against the Detroit Lions after Kolb suffered a concussion in week one against the Green Bay Packers. In Week 5 against the San Francisco 49ers, week six against the Atlanta Falcons and week seven against the Tennessee Titans, Kafka was the backup to Kolb after Vick, who took over as the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, suffered a rib injury in Week 4 against the Washington Redskins. In the week seventeen game against the Dallas Cowboys, Kafka was the backup quarterback to Kolb in a decision to rest Vick and the team's starters before the playoffs. Kafka said of his rookie year that he \"learned a lot about football. I learned a lot about being a professional, especially being around [Vick] and [Kolb]. Those guys have been great mentors, and obviously the coaching staff that I have has been really great as far as developing me to learn the west coast system.\""

        "content": "Following the 2010 season, Kafka said that his goal for the 2011 offseason was to \"continue to learn the offense. I haven't mastered it by any means, the more study and preparation I can get the better. Physically, I can work on my feet, my arm strength, and my timing and rhythm. There's a bunch of things I can work on, and I'm really excited to get to it.\" Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said Kafka is the hardest working player in the NFL, but needs to get bigger and stronger. The Eagles reportedly received trade offers from other teams for Kafka prior to the 2011 NFL Draft but declined due to his potential. Kafka, in response, laughed and did not believe the rumors. Because of the NFL lockout, Kafka and his teammates organized informal workouts in Marlton, New Jersey. After one of the workout sessions, Vick said Kafka was \"ready for\" the backup role and would embrace it should Kolb leave after the lifting of the lockout. Kolb was traded to the Arizona Cardinals on July 28 following the lifting of the NFL lockout, and Kafka was temporarily elevated to the backup behind Vick before the Eagles signed former Tennessee Titan Vince Young on July 29. Kafka took second-team reps at the start of training camp, but on the first official depth chart that was released on August 9, Kafka was listed as the third-stringer behind Young. Against the Baltimore Ravens in the preseason opener on August 11, Kafka replaced Young at quarterback during the second quarter and played into the fourth quarter. He went 13-of-19 for 132\u00a0yards with one interception thrown to Ravens safety Bernard Pollard in the game. In the second week of the preseason on August 18 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kafka entered the game in the fourth quarter and led the Eagles to two scoring drives in a 24\u201314 loss. With less than four minutes remaining in the game, he threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Gerald Jones, and with only 19 seconds left on the following drive, threw a second touchdown pass to Jones for seven\u00a0yards. He finished the game going 14-for-19 for 160\u00a0yards along with the two scores. Kafka played in garbage time in the next preseason game against the Cleveland Browns, handing the ball off twice and kneeling down twice. Against the New York Jets in the preseason finale, he filled in for the injured Young, who started the game, to start the third quarter. Kafka had the wind knocked out of him on a sack, but was able to play the rest of the game despite a rib contusion. He finished the game 7-for-11 for 76\u00a0yards and one interception. He went 34-for-49 for 369\u00a0yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the preseason overall. Young suffered a hamstring injury in the final preseason game, and was subsequently inactive for the team's first two games.  Kafka was active as the backup to Vick in both games, but was forced to play in the second game when Vick suffered a concussion in the second half.  Kafka went 7-of-9 passing for 72\u00a0yards in relief during the 35\u201331 loss to the Atlanta Falcons. Vick broke his hand during a week 3 game against the New York Giants on September 25, so Kafka again replaced him. Kafka threw for 35\u00a0yards and two interceptions as he went 4-for-7 passing. Both Kafka and Young were active as Vick's backups in week 4, with neither seeing playing time. Kafka was declared inactive for week 5, but returned as active for weeks 6 and 8. He was inactive again for weeks 9 and 10, before he was activated for the rest of the season's games. Young started at quarterback in weeks 11, 12, and 13 in place of an injured Vick, elevating Kafka to backup. Kafka saw playing action in two of the final games of the season with no pass attempts."

Kafka was considered the favorite to win the backup job during training camp. According to Adam Caplan from thesidelineview.com, Kafka showed during OTAs that \"his arm strength has noticeably improved\" since his previous two seasons. In the first preseason game on August 9 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kafka suffered a fracture in his non-throwing hand after passing for 31\u00a0yards and an interception. Foles was named the backup quarterback over Kafka and Edwards on August 29, and Kafka was released in favor of Edwards during final roster cuts on August 31, having sat out the remaining three preseason games for the Eagles."

Kafka later said he told McCown he needed to stay on the active roster for week 8 in order to qualify for the NFL's pension program, and McCown facilitated his stay for one more week with head coach Lovie Smith. He was re-signed to the practice squad on October 30. At the conclusion of the 2014 NFL season, Kafka's practice squad contract expired and he was not re-signed by the team."

Birch was one of the scorers as Bangor ran out 3\u20131 victors. Victory in the Welsh Cup entitled Bangor to enter the European Cup Winners' Cup where they were drawn against the Italian cup-winners, Napoli in the preliminary round. The first leg was played at Bangor's Farrar Road Stadium on 5 September 1961 in front of a capacity crowd of 8,000. Part-timers Bangor City, who were lying sixth in the Cheshire League, outplayed their famous rivals.

Birch, the team captain, converted the penalty and, with no further scoring, Bangor had beaten Napoli by two goals to nil to become the first Welsh club to win in European competition. The Second Leg was played in Naples on 26 September in front of a crowd of 80,000. Napoli were 2\u20130 up after 54 minutes, before Bangor scored with twenty minutes remaining, when an awkward throw-in from Birch caused havoc in the Napoli penalty-area, allowing McAllister to sneak the ball past the goalkeeper to put Bangor back ahead on goal difference. Napoli then took the match to a play-off when they scored with five minutes remaining to bring the score to 3\u20131, 3\u20133 on aggregate. At that time, the \"away goals rule\" didn't apply, so a play-off was arranged at Arsenal's Highbury stadium on Wednesday 10 October. Napoli took the lead on 37 minutes when Rosa fired a 20-yard shot in off the crossbar. A tremendous display by Len Davies in goal kept City in the game, and after 25 minutes of the second half, Ellis headed the ball down into the path of McAllister who slotted the ball past Pontel in the Napoli goal. Unfortunately for Bangor, with five minutes to go, Rosa capitalised on a rebound to score his second of the night and put Napoli through."

In the 2010\u201311 season, Brocklehurst left for Europe and signed with Lukko of the Finnish SM-liiga. After a mid-season transfer to Pelicans, Brocklehurst extended for a further one-year extension. On June 8, 2012, Brocklehurst left Finland and signed a one-year contract in Germany with EHC Wolfsburg of the DEL. Whilst leading the Wolfsburg defence with 30 points in 48 games during the 2012\u201313 season, Brocklehurst was re-signed to a one-year extension on February 13, 2013. After two successful and productive seasons from the Grizzly Adams blueline, Brocklehurst opted to transfer to fellow DEL club, ERC Ingolstadt on May 12, 2014. After one season with Ingolstadt, Brocklehurst left the DEL for the neighbouring league, the EBEL, signing a one-year contract with Hungarian club, Alba Vol\u00e1n Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r on July 9, 2015.

Brocklehurst returned to the EBEL for the 2016\u201317 season, signing with the Vienna Capitals on July 6, 2016. Brocklehurst remained with the Capitals for two seasons before agreeing to terms with his third EBEL club, EHC Black Wings Linz, on April 16, 2018. In the 2018\u201319 season with the Black Wings, Brocklehurst continued to contribute from the blueline, posting 6 goals and 28 points in 52 games. He opted to not take up the option of his contract with the Black Wings and left as a free agent following a quarterfinal playoff defeat.

On June 30, 2012, Smith was believed to have suffered stab wounds when attempting to break up a fight at a party at his Santa Clara county residence. Two other people were shot in the incident.  On October 9, 2013, Smith was charged with \"three felony counts of illegal possession of an assault weapon\" relating to the stabbing incident. The charges were later reduced to misdemeanors. On September 20, 2013, Smith was involved in a single-vehicle accident in San Jose, California. He was subsequently arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence and possession of marijuana. After the loss to the Indianapolis Colts in the third week of the football season, he voluntarily entered a rehabilitation facility, to be put onto the non-football injury list with an indefinite leave of absence. On April 13, 2014, Smith was detained and arrested following an incident at the Los Angeles International Airport in which Smith became belligerent and uncooperative with a TSA agent, who alleged Smith claimed he was carrying a bomb. After interviews revealed that Smith did not clearly state he was carrying a bomb, the Los Angeles City Attorney decided to drop the charges. Smith was suspended for nine games for the 2014 season. On August 6, 2015, Smith was arrested in Santa Clara, California, for an alleged hit and run after driving under the influence, and vandalism charges. He was released by the 49ers the next day as a result. On March 9, 2017, Smith was a passenger with a friend driving to Smith's house at 12:00 AM, when the San Francisco police department found out both Smith and the driver were under the influence after hitting a police car. Even though Smith was not the driver, both Smith and his friend were detained by the San Francisco Police Department for questioning. The next day, Smith and his friend were released. No arrests were made. On September 23, 2017, it was announced that Smith had agreed to plead no contest to hit and run in the 2015 incident in exchange for the DUI charges being dropped. He was sentenced to 20 days in jail. During his sentence, he was ordered to attend a treatment facility, and undergo anger management classes. After his release, he was prohibited from entering any bars or other establishments where alcohol is the primary commodity being sold. On March 3, 2018, someone called the police from Smith's home and reported that he had consumed multiple bottles of tequila and then bit her wrists. Smith reportedly fled the home before police arrived. San Francisco police did not comment on the specifics but did state that domestic violence of a \"non-lethal\" nature had occurred and they were seeking out Smith for questioning about the incident. On March 23, 2018, Smith was arrested for violation of a court order, where he was ordered to stay away from a woman he assaulted earlier in the month. The woman was revealed to be Smith's fiancee. This picked up from a previous incident that occurred on March 3, where Smith pleaded not guilty on four misdemeanor counts, including domestic violence, assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury, false imprisonment, and vandalism. On April 8, 2018, Smith was arrested for violations in conditions to his bail. On April 19, 2021, the St. Bernard Parish Sheriff's Office issued an arrest warrant for Smith for second-degree battery. Smith surrendered on April 21, and was released on a $25,000 bond with an arraignment scheduled for July 14. Smith had further DUI arrests in June 2019 and December 2021."

On August 30, he recorded his first major league save, pitching 2 innings and preserving a 2\u20130 lead over the Yankees. Sanchez made 24 appearances for the Blue Jays in 2014, and posted a 2\u20132 record with a 1.09 ERA, 27 strikeouts, 3 saves, and a 0.70 WHIP in 33 innings pitched. Heading into the 2015 season, Sanchez was expected to pitch out of the bullpen, and to compete for the closer role. After Marcus Stroman suffered a torn left ACL on March 10, Sanchez pitched in the rotation for the rest of spring training and earned the fifth starter spot to open the season. He recorded his first win as a starter on April 22, defeating the Baltimore Orioles 4\u20132. Sanchez pitched 5 innings and yielded two runs on two hits and seven walks with four strikeouts. In winning, he became the first Toronto pitcher to win despite issuing seven walks since Jeff Ware in 1995. On May 8, Sanchez shutout the Boston Red Sox over seven innings, recording his first quality start. The Blue Jays would win the game 7\u20130. On June 5, he pitched into the ninth inning against the Houston Astros and took the win, 6\u20132. In addition to setting a career-high in innings pitched, Sanchez did not walk a batter for the first time as a starter. After missing his next scheduled start with upper body soreness, Sanchez was placed on the disabled list on June 14, retroactive to June 6, with a strained lat muscle. On July 19, manager John Gibbons announced that, upon his return from the disabled list, Sanchez would pitch out of the bullpen. He was activated on July 25 in Seattle. Sanchez was ejected from a game against the Kansas City Royals on August 2, for hitting Alcides Escobar with a pitch after home plate umpire Jim Wolf had issued a warning in the first inning.

He entered spring training in competition for the fifth starter role with Gavin Floyd, Drew Hutchison, and Jesse Chavez. On March 28, John Gibbons announced that Sanchez would begin the 2016 season in the starting rotation, but insinuated that he would be held to an innings-limit that may move him to the bullpen later in the season. To that point in the spring, Sanchez had thrown 20 innings, yielding only three runs and three walks while striking out 19. Sanchez carried a 9\u20131 record into the All-Star break, and on July 9, he was named to the 2016 All-Star Game as a replacement for Craig Kimbrel. On July 25, Sanchez won his 10th consecutive decision, defeating the San Diego Padres. In doing so, he became the first Blue Jay since Roy Halladay in 2003 to win at least 10 consecutive decisions. In his start on July 31, Sanchez threw seven innings and surpassed his career-high of 133 innings pitched, raising his 2016 total to 139. Prior to the trade deadline, the Blue Jays acquired Francisco Liriano from the Pittsburgh Pirates, and it was widely believed that Liriano would take Sanchez's place in the starting rotation and allow Sanchez to be moved to the bullpen, to better limit his workload in the 2016 season. Several members of the team and media, including Russell Martin and Hall-of-Famer John Smoltz, expressed their desire to see Sanchez remain in the rotation. Entering August, Sanchez had an American League leading 2.71 ERA. After meeting with Sanchez, John Gibbons, and pitching coach Pete Walker, general manager Ross Atkins announced on August 4 that Sanchez would remain a starter, and that the team would use a six-man rotation. Sanchez started against the Cleveland Indians on August 20, and was optioned to the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays the following day in order to skip his next start. Sanchez was recalled on August 31. He lasted just 3 innings in his start on September 11, leaving due to a blister on his pitching hand. Sanchez's next start was skipped to allow his blister to heal, and he returned to the rotation on September 21. Sanchez earned his 15th win of the season on October 2, lowering his earned run average to 3.00 and earning him the American League ERA title. The win also clinched the first AL Wild Card position. Sanchez closed the 2016 regular season with a 15\u20132 record, 3.00 ERA, and 161 strikeouts in 192 innings pitched. He started the third game of the Division Series against the Texas Rangers, and allowed six earned runs in 5 innings. Toronto would win the game in extra innings, 7\u20136, and eliminate the Rangers from the postseason for the second consecutive season. In the Championship Series, Sanchez started Game 4 and gave the Blue Jays their only win of the series, pitching six innings and allowing only two hits and one earned run to the Cleveland Indians. On October 25, general manager Ross Atkins stated that the organization would not limit Sanchez's innings in the 2017 season. Sanchez finished seventh in voting for the 2016 American League Cy Young Award, receiving a third place vote and three fifth place votes. On January 25, 2017, Sanchez was announced as the cover athlete for the Canadian version of MLB The Show 17. During 2017 spring training, the Blue Jays renewed Sanchez's contract at the MLB-minimum of $535,000. The team had reportedly attempted to negotiate a raise in payment with Sanchez and his agent, Scott Boras, however the offer was refused by Sanchez and Boras. On April 16, Sanchez was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a lingering blister on his right hand. He underwent minor surgery on April 18 to remove a portion of the fingernail on his right middle finger. Sanchez was activated from the disabled list on April 30 and started that day against the Tampa Bay Rays, but lasted only one inning before leaving with a split fingernail. The injury forced Sanchez back to the disabled list the following day. On May 20, 2017, Sanchez was placed on the 10-day disabled list for the third time of the season due to the same finger issue. Sanchez was placed on the disabled list for the fourth time in the season on July 22 with a recurrence of the same blister. Sanchez made only 8 starts for the Blue Jays in 2017 due to blister and finger issues, finishing with a 1-3 record and a 4.25 ERA. On January 12, 2018, Sanchez avoided salary arbitration with the Blue Jays by signing a one-year, $2.7 million contract. He struggled to begin the season with inconsistency and control, walking 45 batters in  innings. He was placed on the disabled list on June 23 with a contusion in his right hand. He finished the season 4-6 in 20 starts."

        "content": "Hunt began playing in the Ridge Meadows Minor Hockey Association at the atom level. He began as a forward but in pee-wee he switched to defence to gain more playing time. He played two years of midget AAA then made the junior B Ridge Meadows Flames in the Pacific Junior Hockey League (PJHL) as a sixteen-year-old. In his first year with the Flames, he was named the team's Rookie of the Year and played in the PJHL All-Star and Prospect Game. During the season, he was called up to the junior A Burnaby Express in the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL). He played just three games for the Express and an additional two playoff games. That said, he was with the team when they won the 2006 Royal Bank Cup as Canadian junior A champions. He stayed with the Express the following season and played in 60 games scoring 4 goals and 38 points and added another 8 points in 14 playoff games. For his efforts, he was named the team's Most Outstanding Defenceman. In the 2007\u201308 season, his final with the team, he increased his offensive production to 16 goals and 55 points and played in the BCHL All-Star Game. He was again named the team's Most Outstanding Defenceman, while the Express Lost in Round 1 in 5 Games against the Victoria Grizzlies. Following his third season in junior, Hunt attended Bemidji State University (BSU). While there, he played with the Bemidji State Beavers, in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. In his first season with the Beavers, Hunt scored 9 goals and 32 points in 33 games. BSU won the College Hockey America (CHA) tournament with Hunt being named to the CHA All-Tournament Team. By winning the tournament, Bemidji State earned an automatic bid to the 2009 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. The Beavers entered the tournament as the lowest seeded team and matched up with Notre Dame. BSU upset the Fighting Irish and proceed to defeat Cornell University, advancing to the Frozen Four. With the wins, Bemidji State became the first number 16 seed to make the Frozen Four, and the first team to ever make the Frozen Four from outside college hockey's top four conferences. Their Cinderella run ended with a 4\u20131 loss to Miami University. Hunt was named to the NCAA Midwest Regional All-Tournament Team. At the end of the season, he was also named to the All-CHA Rookie Team, All-CHA First Team, and named CHA Rookie of the Year. In his second season, Hunt's goal production dipped slightly to 7, but he increased his assist total to 26. His assist total was one shy of tying the school's Division I single season record held by Luke Erickson. At the end of the season, he was again named to the All-CHA First Team. In the 2010 CHA Tournament, the top-ranked Beavers were upset by Niagara University in the first round and later tied Robert Morris University in the consolation game. Though they failed to capture the automatic bid for the 2010 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, BSU received an at-large bit thanks in part to a school record 22 consecutive weeks of being ranked in the top 15. The Beavers lost in the first round of the tournament to the University of Michigan. For the 2010\u201311 season, Bemidji State moved from the CHA to the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). Hunt's point production dropped in the new conference as he registered 3 goals and 21 points. He stated that part of reason for the drop in production was teams recognizing his shooting ability and preventing him from getting shots off. While his individual numbers were lower, he was the quarterback of one of the conference's top power plays. In the 2011 WCHA Tournament, the Beavers advanced to the semifinals where they were defeated by the University of Denver. In his senior season, Hunt was named one of the team's alternate captains. He increased his production in the WCHA, scoring 5 goals and 26 points while reducing his penalty minutes (PIMs) to a career low 8. In the 2012 WCHA Tournament, Bemidji State lost in the first round to University of North Dakota. By finishing his Bemidji State career with 112 points, Hunt became just the sixth defenceman in school history to eclipse the 100 point mark and left as the Beaver's all-time leader in defenceman scoring and defenceman power play goals."

He finished the season with 4 goals and 33 points as the Wolves missed the playoffs. In the off-season, Hunt signed a two-year entry level contract with the Edmonton Oilers, for whom MacTavish had become the general manager. He attended Oilers training camp and in his first preseason game, Hunt registered two assists against the Vancouver Canucks. He failed to make the team out of camp and was assigned to the Oilers AHL affiliate, the Oklahoma City Barons. Hunt played 29 games for the Barons, scoring 3 goals and 15 points, leading the Oklahoma City defence in scoring. After the Oilers suffered some injuries on the back-end, he was called up to Edmonton. He made his NHL debut on January 3, 2013, in a game against the Anaheim Ducks.

He tallied 3 powerplay goals and added 5 points in 29 games from the blueline with the Wild, as the club missed the playoffs for the first time in 7 seasons. On June 24, 2019, Hunt was signed to a two-year, $1.4 million contract extension to remain with the Wild. After the better part of three seasons with the Wild, Hunt left the club as a free agent and was signed to a one-year, $800,000 contract with the Vancouver Canucks on July 28, 2021."

In October 2007, at the age of 17, she was given a four-year contract with the club and was described by the coach as a future national team player. Brodin spent three seasons with B\u00e4linge before their relegation from the Damallsvenskan in 2008. Ahead of the 2009 season, she rejected an offer from Tyres\u00f6 FF and joined AIK instead. When AIK suffered relegation in 2010, a disappointed Brodin moved to Tyres\u00f6 explaining that she had to keep playing Damallsvenskan football to be considered for the national team. Tyres\u00f6 won the Damallsvenskan title for the first time in the 2012 season and Brodin collected her first league winner's medal. With competition for places increasingly fierce at Tyres\u00f6, Brodin moved to Pite\u00e5 on loan during the 2013 mid-season break. In November 2013 Brodin made her transfer to Pite\u00e5 permanent, despite reported interest from other clubs. After helping Pite\u00e5 to a third-place finish in 2015, she left for Djurg\u00e5rdens IF, explaining that the social aspect of living back in Stockholm had attracted her. A serious knee injury sustained in January 2017 ruled Brodin out of the entire 2017 Damallsvenskan season and UEFA Women's Euro 2017. Although that was the final year of her Djurg\u00e5rdens contract, she was happy to sign a one-year extension in October 2017 and expected to be back to full fitness in 2018. In March 2018 Brodin announced that she was pregnant with her first child. Although she had already resumed training after her knee injury, she was forced to put her football comeback plans on hold."

With the Phillies, Diekman began as a starting pitcher and progressed through a few levels of the Phillies' farm system in his first two years in that role, before adjusting his mechanics and lowering his arm slot to throw sidearm out of the bullpen, as a relief pitcher. The adjustment worked and helped him move through the remaining levels of the Phillies' farm system. In 2012, Diekman made his major league debut. Over the next two seasons, he split time between the major league Phillies and their Triple-A (AAA) affiliate, the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, though while he was with the major league team, he was considered one of the \"lone bright spots\" in both 2012 and .

Eventually, Diekman joined an American Legion baseball team, playing in the summer with other players from Wymore and several surrounding towns, which he called \"the best experience of my life ... so much fun.\" Concurrently, Diekman worked full-time at a lawn mower factory, to earn money to pursue a post-secondary education. After graduating from high school, Diekman enrolled at Doane College, pitching one season for the school's ball team. He then transferred to Cloud County Community College, in Kansas. Following Diekman's sophomore season, he attended a junior college baseball showcase at which, with a fastball well over , Diekman drew much interest. He received an offer for a full scholarship to be a Nebraska Cornhusker, which he would have accepted, had the Phillies not drafted him in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft's 30th round."

        "content": "Between 2007 and 2010, he pitched in the lower levels of the Philadelphia Phillies' Minor League system initially as a starter, and subsequently as a reliever. Although he initially saw success in 2007, posting a 2.72 ERA in 10 starts with GCL Phillies and Williamsport Crosscutters, he struggled in 2008, posting an ERA of 5.09 in 27 starts, split between Williamsport and the Lakewood BlueClaws. At the conclusion of both 2008 and 2009, he pitched in the Florida Instructional League to continue honing his skills on the mound. He converted from a starting pitcher to a reliever in 2009, along with several other Phillies pitching prospects. Around that time, he also, at the suggestion of the same minor league pitching coaches who converted him to relief, lowered his release point to his current low angle. Success did not manifest itself immediately, as he still posted a 4.04 ERA in 2009, his first season in relief, but in 2010, he cut his ERA to 2.91 while splitting time between Lakewood and the Clearwater Threshers, the Phillies High-A affiliate. At the end of the 2010 season, he played for the Mesa Solar Sox in the Arizona Fall League. He spent the 2011 season with the Double-A Reading Phillies, accruing a 0\u20131 record and a 3.05 ERA and 3 saves in 53 games. Thereafter, the Phillies added him to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. After receiving praise from Phillies' pitching coach Rich Dubee for his performance in spring training, Diekman opened the 2012 season with the Triple-A (AAA) Lehigh Valley IronPigs. With Lehigh Valley, he posted a 1\u20130 record and a 0.59 ERA with 5 saves in 13 games in the season's first month.  He was added to the Phillies' 25-man Major League roster on May 11, and four days later recorded a win against the Houston Astros in his MLB debut. He finished the year an established lefty specialist, and had a 3.95 ERA, though walked 6.6 batters per 9 innings, and was erratic in his control. Entering 2013, Diekman was expected to be a key part of the Phillies bullpen after his success in 2012, however he did not break camp with the big league club, beginning the season in AAA. In AAA, he struggled, which delayed his arrival to the major league team until June. While with the big league club, he continued his dominance of left-handed hitters, however was not as good against right-handed hitters (a 150-point differential in opponent batting average and over 300 point differential in On-base plus slugging (OPS)). Diekman improved his control, which made him a presumptive member of the 2014 bullpen, as he was one of 2013's \"lone bright spots\" for the otherwise dismal Phillies' bullpen. Ultimately, he did make the Phillies' opening day roster as a member of the bullpen. Early in the season, Diekman emerged as a reliable reliever in the Phillies' bullpen, and was used extensively by manager Ryne Sandberg. As the season progressed, Diekman was more successful against left-handed hitters than right-handed hitters, but was used against both in a variety of situations. On September 1, 2014, Diekman was one of four pitchers who combined for a no-hitter in the Phillies' 7-0 win over the Atlanta Braves in Turner Field. By the end of the season, the Phillies had one of the best bullpens in the league, and it consisted predominantly of young players such as Diekman. There was excitement from both Phillies' personnel and writers that the bullpen could remain solid for a long time because of young pitchers such as Diekman, Ken Giles, and Justin De Fratus. Moreover, Diekman and Giles had potential as closers should the Phillies trade Jonathan Papelbon. Overall, Diekman emerged as a name to be mentioned among the \"elite\" relievers of the National League, but was overused against right-handed batters, which hurt his statistics."

Despite suggestions he remain a lefty specialist, he emerged in 2014 as a favorite middle reliever for manager Ryne Sandberg against both righties and lefties.

        "content": "Going into the 2012 NFL Draft, Boykin was projected as one of the best cornerback prospects. He was drafted in the fourth round (123rd overall) of the 2012 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. He signed a four-year contract with the team on May 11, 2012. His first season he recorded 31 total tackles, 7 passes defended, and 1 forced fumble. He saw little playing action on defense, but his 1,037 kick return yards were second in the NFC and seventh in the NFL. Boykin started the 2013 season with his first interception, off Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III, helping the Eagles to win 33\u201327. He recorded his next interception in a week 5 win over the Giants where he picked off Eli Manning. In a week 10 game against the Green Bay Packers who were without quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Boykin intercepted quarterback Scott Tolzien's pass in the endzone and ran it back for 76 yards. He followed up again the next week, intercepting Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III. In a week 16 game against the Chicago Bears, Boykin intercepted Jay Cutler and ran it back 54 yards for the score. The week 17 showdown against division rival Dallas Cowboys was for the NFC East division title. Late in the fourth quarter the Cowboys marched down the field when back-up quarterback Kyle Orton threw behind his wide receiver, Miles Austin. Boykin intercepted the pass and kneed it after a short return. The interception led to the Eagles rushing the ball twice for a first down, then two kneel downs to run out the clock and seal the Eagles' divisional win at a final score of 24\u201322. Boykin enjoyed a breakout year in 2013 with 42 solo tackles, 5 assists, 2 forced fumbles, 16 passes defended, and 6 interceptions (second in the NFL). For the 2014 season, Boykin had 36 solo tackles, 5 assists, 9 passes defended, and an interception."

        "content": "In his freshman season Scott was the backup to senior Willie Tuitama and was used mostly as a change of pace quarterback who could run the ball. In this role Scott gained 188 yards rushing averaging 8 yards per carry and scoring two touchdowns. In his limited opportunities to pass he completed 7 of his 11 attempts for 84 yards and 1 touchdown. Scott was the starting quarterback entering the 2009 season. He got the Wildcats off to a 2-0 start in the 2009 season, however in the third game of the season against Iowa he was pulled in favor of backup Nick Foles. Scott played poorly against Iowa completing only four passes and throwing an interception for a total of 50 yards. Scott played sparingly the rest of the year. He saw some action in a blowout win against Washington State, a blowout bowl loss to Nebraska, and was used as a change of pace quarterback to run in other games. Foles however had established himself as the starting quarterback and the best option to run offensive coordinator Sonny Dykes' pass heavy offense. Entering the 2010 season Scott was the backup quarterback to Foles following Foles' superior play after Scott's benching the previous season. In the summer before the 2010 season Scott said that he \"can't stand sitting on the bench\" and that he had \"never been a bench warmer since Pop Warner.\" He also said that he was open to a possible position switch to wide receiver so that he could play. Scott got to play in the first two games of the season after Arizona had gained a sizable lead against their opponents Toledo and Citadel. After the first two games Scott did not see any action again until the Washington State game. Foles left the game with an injury that would turn out to be a dislocated knee. Scott came in and was able to fend off Washington State and secure a win. Scott would start the next two games while Foles recovered from his injury. In the two games Scott started in Foles' absence Arizona won both times beating Washington by thirty points and going to UCLA to win there. Foles came back for the next game against Stanford and Scott was relegated back to his backup role. The Wildcats concluded the season on a 5-game losing streak finishing 7-6. During the 2011 season Scott redshirted while Foles would start every game. Foles played close to every snap and a backup quarterback was rarely used. By redshirting Scott got the opportunity to come back for a fifth season and have the possibility of starting, rather than running out of eligibility as a backup quarterback. Rich Rodriguez was hired to be the new head coach of the Wildcats for the 2012 season. This was seen as a positive for Scott who many saw as a perfect fit for Rodriguez's spread option offense because of his speed and mobility. Scott flourished with Rodriguez as head coach. He passed for more than 3,000 yards and threw 21 touchdowns. Following an upset of Oklahoma State Arizona entered the top 25 rankings. They completed another big upset when they beat preseason favorite USC in Tucson.  Scott played this game on his parents 27th anniversary and dedicated the win to them.  He stated that his parents were at every game he played in and was thankful to have the family support he had during this crazy ride in Arizona. Scott's greatest statistical performance of the season came in defeat however. Against Stanford he set school and Pac-12 records for attempts and completions and passed for 491 yards against Stanford. The 491 yards is third in school history.  He finished his career with a win against Nevada in the New Mexico Bowl. He engineered a 17-point fourth quarter comeback in the game, throwing for three touchdowns in the final quarter to help Arizona win 49-48."

He scored his first goal for the club in his Superliga debut, a 1\u20130 victory against rivals FC Copenhagen, after having come on as a substitute for Besar Halimi in the 88th minute. Tibbling quickly established himself in head coach Alexander Zorniger's side, and was nominated for a goal he scored against Silkeborg IF in October 2017, which ended up being awarded \u2018Goal of the Season\u2019 by the Danish Football Union, beating out fellow nominees including Christian Eriksen and Peter Ankersen. His first season in Br\u00f8ndby was highly successful, making 35 appearances across all competitions and scoring three goals, as Br\u00f8ndby made a failed push for the league championship, ending in second place behind FC Midtjylland. However, Tibbling appeared as a starter as Br\u00f8ndby beat Silkeborg IF 3\u20131 in the 2017\u201318 Danish Cup final. In his second season at Br\u00f8ndby, controversy arose in September 2018, as tabloid B.T. revealed a confrontation between Tibbling and head coach Zorniger after a match in October the previous year. This had led to Tibbling contacting director of football, Troels Bech the following day. The case came a month after league rivals Midtjylland had offered DKK 7.5 million (\u20ac1 million) in an effort to sign him, efforts which were not immediately dismissed by Tibbling and his agent, fuelling doubts about his commitment to his club. Tibbling would personally experience a strong 2018\u201319 season, making 43 appearances in which he scored five goals, as Br\u00f8ndby, however, went through a tumultuous period. The club had dropped off to fourth place and lost the cup final to Midtjylland, while head coach Zorniger had been dismissed halfway through the season. In the following season, Tibbling slowly saw his playing time diminished under new head coach Niels Frederiksen, as a foot injury suffered in August 2019 kept him out for three months."

Pomeranz made his professional debut with Rookie League Johnson City, where in 4 appearances, he was 1-1 with a 6.14 ERA. In his first full season, Pomeranz pitched with Single-A Peoria, where in 17 starts, he was 12-4 with a 3.55 ERA, striking out 88 in 101.1 innings. His 12 victories were the most in the Cardinals minor league system in 2004. Pomeranz began 2005 with High-A Palm Beach, where he pitched well in 8 starts before earning a promotion to Double-A Springfield, where he didn't pitch as well in 18 starts. Combined in 2005, he was 7-11 with a 4.65 ERA, striking out 95 in 147 innings. Pomeranz made 18 more starts for Springfield in 2006, going 7-4 with a 4.39 ERA, striking out 64 in 98.1 innings. He was charged with a DUI in 2006. After the season, he pitched for the Peoria Saguaros in the Arizona Fall League where in 6 starts over 17 innings, he went 1-2, giving up 30 hits and 8 walks with a 9.00 ERA. In July 2007, Pomeranz underwent arthroscopic surgery on his injured shoulder, and he only made 6 starts that year between Palm Beach and the GCL Cardinals, going 1-2 with a 6.28 ERA. After the season, he played with the Mesa Solar Sox in the AFL, performing much better, going 2-0 in 5 starts with an 0.64 ERA. Pitching at extended spring training at the time, Pomeranz was released by the Cardinals on May 13, 2008. On May 13, 2009, Pomeranz signed a minor league deal with the Chicago White Sox, but he was released 12 days later. Pomeranz pitched in independent ball in 2009 with the New Jersey Jackals of the Can-Am League. In 16 appearances (14 starts), he was 5-6 with a 6.50 ERA, striking out 48 in 73.1 innings. On March 29, 2010, Pomeranz signed a minor league deal with the Colorado Rockies, and was assigned to Double-A Tulsa. Used as the closer and pitching out of the bullpen extensively for the first time in his professional career, he recorded 18 saves in 51 appearances, striking out 53 in 49 innings. On December 6, 2010, Pomeranz signed a minor league deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He made 3 appearances during Spring Training. He only made two appearances in their system, with Double-A Chattanooga before he was released on June 8. Following his release, he underwent surgery on his elbow to remove bone chips. After re-establishing himself with the Tiburones de La Guaira in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League over the winter, going 4-0 with a 1.93 ERA in 18 appearances, Pomeranz went to tryouts at Camden Yards in January. On February 3, 2012, Pomeranz signed a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles. He made 8 appearances during Spring Training, giving up 1 run in 8.1 innings, and he was assigned to Double-A Bowie to begin the year. Pomeranz earned a promotion to Triple-A Norfolk, pitching 13.1 scoreless innings for the Baysox. He then pitched 5.2 scoreless innings with Norfolk before earning another promotion. Pomeranz was called up to the majors for the first time on May 7, 2012. He made his major league debut that night, pitching 3 scoreless innings. That night, his brother, Drew, hit a home run with the Colorado Rockies. He made 2 more appearances with the Orioles before he was placed the disabled list on May 28, 2012 with a left oblique strain. The strain was serious enough for the Orioles to move him to the 60-day disabled list on June 6. On November 30, 2012, Pomeranz was designated for assignment, and the next day, it was announced he needed back surgery and would miss all of 2013. On January 8, 2013, the Orioles re-signed Pomeranz to a minor league deal. As of 2014, the surgery was not successful and needed to be redone, and Pomeranz hasn't pitched since 2012."

Two NFL teams told Adam Schefter of ESPN that Hundley was potentially the top quarterback of the 2014 NFL Draft if he left school early. However, Hundley elected to return for his junior year at UCLA. Leading up to the draft, some scouts questioned Hundley's passing accuracy and decision making."

The team began the season undefeated at 4\u20130 until the No. 8 Bruins were upset 30\u201328 by the Utah Utes. In the game, Hundley was sacked a career-high 10 times, renewing concerns over his pocket awareness.

Hundley eventually ran more, including 24 carries for a season-high 131 yards in a 17\u20137 win over Arizona. Later in the season, he also became UCLA's all-time leader in touchdown passes, surpassing Cade McNown's record of 68; McNown's record came in four years as a starter (1995\u20131998), while Hundley broke the record in just his third season. Hundley also became the school's career leader in total offense, breaking McNown's previous mark of 11,285. He was named to the All-Pac-12 second team. He finished his career with 9,966 passing yards, second in school history behind McNown. He had also rushed for 1,747 career yards, behind only John Sciarra (1,813) among quarterbacks in UCLA history.

On May 7, 2015, the Packers officially signed Hundley to a four-year deal. He became the third-string quarterback on the depth chart behind Aaron Rodgers and Scott Tolzien. Hundley's success in the preseason and off-the-field maturity eventually led to his being named as the Packers' backup quarterback after Tolzien's departure to the Indianapolis Colts. During the first quarter of the Week 6 game against the Minnesota Vikings on October 15, 2017, Rodgers suffered a broken collarbone on a hit by Anthony Barr. Hundley then entered the game, completing 18-of-33 passes for 157 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions as the Packers lost by a score of 23\u201310. After the game, head coach Mike McCarthy stated that Hundley would take over as the starter due to Rodgers's broken collarbone. In his first start against the New Orleans Saints, Hundley recorded 12 completions on 25 attempts for just 87 yards, no touchdowns, an interception, and a passer rating under 40 for the second consecutive week, though he did contribute a 14-yard rushing touchdown. After a Week 8 bye, Hundley had 245 passing yards and a rushing touchdown in a loss to the Detroit Lions in Week 9. Week 10 continued this improvement, with 18 of 25 passing for 212 yards, no interceptions, and his first 100+ passer rating as a starter in a win over the Chicago Bears. Hundley had 200+ passing yards for his third consecutive outing in Week 11, but had three interceptions and no touchdowns during the team's shutout loss to the Baltimore Ravens. In a Week 12 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Hundley improved with a 134 passer rating and three touchdowns. During Week 13 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Hundley was held to only 84 passing yards and an interception. He rushed for 66 yards with the Packers combining for 199 rushing yards and winning 26\u201320 in overtime. He followed that up with 265 passing yards and three touchdowns against the Cleveland Browns in a 27\u201321 overtime win. After the Packers were eliminated from postseason contention, Hundley struggled going 17-of-40 for 130 passing yards and two interceptions in the 16\u20130 loss to the Vikings. In the season finale against the Lions, he had 172 passing yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions in the 35\u201311 loss. He also had his first career reception on a 10-yard pass from wide receiver Randall Cobb on a trick play. Overall, in the 2017 season, Hundley finished with 1,836 passing yards, nine touchdowns, 12 interceptions, 270 rushing yards, and two rushing touchdowns."

Maness started his professional career with the Batavia Muckdogs of the Class A-Short Season New York\u2013Penn League. After appearing in the All-Star Game, the Cardinals promoted him to the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. He finished the season with the Quad Cities River Bandits of the Class A Midwest League. Maness is noted for his control: in  innings pitched in 2012, he allowed only ten walks. Maness was named to the Texas League postseason All-Star team in 2012.  On November 30, 2012, Maness was named the Cardinals' Minor League Pitcher of the Year. His efforts on the mound helped Double A Springfield as they were named Minor League Team of the Year by Baseball America. On April 29, 2013, Maness was called up to the major leagues due to the Cardinals' struggling bullpen. Maness made his MLB debut on May 3. He pitched one inning in his debut, against the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park in the eighth inning, giving up no hits, and getting three consecutive groundouts (the third out hit to him) for his debut, following the seventh inning debut of Carlos Martinez who was brought up earlier that day. On May 15, 2013, he became the first Cardinal rookie pitcher since 1900 with three relief wins in his first five major league appearances.  In 66 games with St. Louis, Maness went 5\u20132 with 15 holds, 1 save and a 2.32 ERA, striking out 35 in 62 innings. He led the team in ERA. Maness pitched five effective innings in the Cardinals postseason run, posting an earned run average of 1.80. The one earned run he surrendered was a three-run home run to Jonny Gomes in Game 4 of the 2013 World Series. The Cardinals would not lead in a World Series game after this home run, falling in six games. An arbitration-eligible player prior to the 2016 season, Maness and the Cardinals agreed to a one-year, $1.4 million contract on January 15, 2016. After yielding a 6.39 ERA for the season, and his velocity on all four pitches down 2-3\u00a0mph, he landed on the DL for the first time in his career on May 14, after an exam revealed an inflammation on his right (pitching) elbow. He was having pitching difficulties, getting hit hard in his previous  inning work against the Anaheim Angels on May 12. For the season, he has a 6.39 ERA and 1.97 WHIP in  innings. He will eventually be able to join a Minor League affiliate on a rehab assignment, instead of as a member of that club's roster. That rehab assignment can last up to 30 days. On August 16, Maness was placed on the disabled list with an elbow strain. It was later revealed that Maness would need to undergo Tommy John surgery, effectively ending his 2016 season and likely for most of the 2017 season. After a medical review of his injury, Maness had surgery on August 18, to fix his Ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint instead of Tommy John surgery ligament replacement, drastically reducing his recovery time from 12\u201315 months to 6\u20138 months, which would make him available for Spring Training in 2017. The Cardinals non-tendered him on December 2, 2016, making him a free agent."

He stayed in-state to play college basketball and decided to suit up for the UC Irvine Anteaters. In 1998\u201399, Green's freshman season, he started all 26 games and averaged 12.8 points per contest. His scoring led the team, as did his 3.9 assists per game average and 38 total steals.

The following season, he increased his scoring average to 15.6 points per game, which led the team. At the Sooner Holiday Classic tournament, Green recorded 37 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in the two games, causing him to be named Big West Conference Player of the Week. Despite increased production by Green, UC Irvine only managed to improve to a 14\u201314 overall record. In 2000\u201301, his junior year, there was a dramatic turnaround for the program as Green guided them to a school-record 25 wins (along with five losses). They won their first-ever conference championship and were invited to play in the 2001 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) where they lost in the opening round. Green averaged 19.0 points, 4.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists and was named the Big West Player of the Year. Along the way he was also named the conference player of the week four times and made two game-winning shots, one against Long Beach State and one against Boise State. For the second year in a row, Green led the Anteaters to a conference championship in 2001\u201302 as well as a berth into the 2001 NIT.

He eventually decided to return to school for his final season in hopes of increasing his draft stock. Ultimately this never paid off as no teams selected him in 2002. Green has spent his entire professional career overseas. He has played in leagues in Belgium, Poland, Italy, and Germany. His most successful season was in 2006\u201307 after he was named the German Bundesliga's MVP. Despite never attaining his dream of playing the National Basketball Association, Green has kept a positive attitude about his situation: \"I've gotten to experience different cultures and see new things...And the fans over here are crazy about basketball. They're almost as bad as soccer fans. We need a police escort to get from the bus to the arena.\""

Additionally, he led Lincoln to their first-ever state title in 2009 while being named the Ohio Gatorade Player of the Year, and was the NSCAA National High School Player of the Year in 2010. In 2014, Trapp had his number 20 jersey retired by Lincoln. At club level, he played four seasons in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy with Columbus, captaining his teams at U16 and U18 level. Trapp was the Crew Academy player of the year in 2009 and 2010. He was rated as a five-star recruit by Top Drawer Soccer and as the fifth-ranked recruit in the nation by multiple outlets, eventually committing to play for head coach Caleb Porter and the Akron Zips. Trapp would play just two seasons at Akron, making 45 appearances for the Zips and scoring once. As a freshman, he started all 23 games, putting up performances that were impressive enough to earn him nods as the top freshman player in the country, MAC Newcomer of the Year, and to the All-MAC First Team. On August 27, 2011, Trapp notched the game-winning assist on his collegiate debut against Cleveland State; he would finish the season with five assists. As a sophomore, Trapp was named to the All-MAC First Team for the second consecutive season, and was named an NSCAA Third Team All-American. He tallied three assists in 22 games, and also scored his only collegiate goal: the winning goal against Bowling Green in the MAC Tournament semifinals. Akron won three MAC titles during Trapp's two years with the program, two regular season and one tournament, and qualified for the NCAA Tournament in both seasons."

        "content": "On December 13, 2012, it was announced that Trapp had signed with his hometown Major League Soccer club, Columbus Crew, as a Homegrown Player. He became the fourth HGP signing in club history, following in the path of Aaron Horton, Matt Lampson, and Ben Speas. After missing the early part of his first season while on international duty, Trapp made his professional debut for the Crew on July 7, 2013, starting and playing the full ninety minutes in a 1\u20130 victory against Portland Timbers; he was named as the club's man of the match after completing 86 percent of his passes. Trapp started the final sixteen matches of the season for Columbus, earning a postseason nod as the club's Breakout Performer of the Year. Ahead of his second professional season, Trapp was named as the vice captain for Columbus, serving as understudy to Michael Parkhurst. Trapp wore the captain's armband for the first time on May 17, 2014, captaining the Crew in Parkhurst's absence against Portland. He became the first Homegrown Player in MLS history to wear the captain's armband in a league fixture, and at 21 years old was the youngest captain in league history. Trapp set a number of other firsts throughout the season: he received his first red card on May 4, part of a 2\u20130 defeat against Sporting Kansas City, and scored his first professional goal on September 13, part of a 2\u20132 draw against Houston Dynamo. He made his postseason debut in the conference semifinals, starting both legs against New England Revolution. Additionally, Trapp was selected to take part in the 2014 Major League Soccer Homegrown Game, alongside his teammate Lampson. Trapp finished the season with one goal in 31 total appearances. Trapp's 2015 season was defined by absences at club level, both for injury and international duty. His first serious injury with Columbus was suffered in April, a concussion that saw him miss thirteen total matches stretching through the end of June. Trapp then missed multiple matches in the fall, stemming from two call-ups to the United States U23 national team. He was at his best in the postseason, starting all five matches as Crew SC made a run to MLS Cup 2015. There, Trapp tallied a shot and committed three fouls as Crew SC were defeated 2\u20131 by Portland. He made 25 appearances during the season. Trapp was named as a 2016 MLS All-Star, the first Homegrown Player in Crew SC history to be named as an all-star. He made the 22-man game day roster, coming on as a halftime substitute for Giovani dos Santos in the 2\u20131 defeat to Arsenal. Outside of that honor, however, 2016 was mostly a season of disappointment for both Trapp and Crew SC. He missed the entire month of September after suffering a concussion in late August, sitting out four matches before returning to the field. Trapp tallied just one assist in 32 appearances in all competitions, tied for the lowest number of his career, and Columbus missed the playoffs for the first time since his first season as a pro. Ahead of the 2017 season, Trapp signed a contract extension running through 2020, tying him to the club through his age-27 season. Columbus traded Parkhurst to Atlanta United ahead of the 2017 season; to take his place, Trapp was elevated to the role of captain. He served ahead of a five-man leadership council, made up of Federico Higua\u00edn, Ethan Finlay, Justin Meram, Jonathan Mensah, and Josh Williams, that collectively served as vice-captains. In his first season as captain, Trapp started all 40 games that Columbus played: 34 in the league, five in the playoffs, and one in the U.S. Open Cup. He marked his 100th MLS appearance on April 15, playing the full ninety minutes in a 2\u20131 victory over Toronto FC. Trapp set multiple personal records on the season, tallying his career-high in assists with five, minutes played with more than 3,000, and earning three MLS Team of the Week nods. Although Trapp remained as captain for the 2018 season, the leadership council behind him was updated, consisting of Ricardo Clark, Higua\u00edn, Hector Jim\u00e9nez, Jonathan, Zack Steffen, and Williams. On July 21, Trapp scored just his second professional goal, coming in a 3\u20132 victory against Orlando City. His strike from nearly forty yards out, coming two minutes into second-half stoppage time, handed Crew SC all three points and was named as MLS Goal of the Week."

The assistant coach for the Americans at the tournament was Caleb Porter, who Trapp had just committed to play under at Akron. Trapp played twice in Lisbon, coming on as a substitute in the opener against the Netherlands and starting against Portugal. These would mark his only two appearances at U18 level. Trapp received his first call-up to the U20 national team in January 2012, part of a training camp held in Florida. As the camp did not include a match, Trapp had to wait until June 6 to make his official debut for the team, starting a 4\u20132 defeat against Uruguay at Estadio Gran Parque Central. Trapp was named in the American squads for the 2013 Toulon Tournament, the 2013 CONCACAF U-20 Championship, and the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He scored his only goal at U20 level on February 26, 2013, providing the goal to send the U.S. to the U20 World Cup at the expense of Canada in the CONCACAF Championship quarterfinals, and was selected to the tournament's Best XI. Trapp capped his time with the U20s at the World Cup, playing all 270 minutes and captaining the side against France, although the United States failed to progress out of the group stage. He scored one goal in 21 appearances at U20 level, and was named as the U.S. Soccer Young Male Athlete of the Year in 2013. Although he had already earned his first senior cap, Trapp was called up by the U23 national team for the first time in March 2015.

Academy manager Kristjaan Speakman suggested there were parts of his game that needed improvement: \"Over the last few years, he has always been regarded as a ball-playing midfielder, very comfortable in possession and able to retain it. What the manager wants from his midfield players is the ability to affect the game out of possession as well.\" In a July 2013 interview, Brown concurred: he rated his best quality as \"what I can do on the ball\", and felt he needed to improve his mental strength."

Was a real threat whenever he received the ball and came close to scoring with a header\", and was named man of the match by both newspaper and club. He made four starts in all before his loan was cut short because of injury."

        "content": "Gary Rowett, who replaced Clark as manager soon after Brown's return to Birmingham, included the player among the substitutes for his first match in charge, though he remained unused. In February 2015, while praising Brown's technical skill and ability with the ball, Rowett felt he needed to improve off the ball, especially because of the physical nature of Championship football, and to prove himself in training. He selected him once more that season, in the absence of midfielders Stephen Gleeson and Diego Fabbrini and in recognition of his improvement in training, again on the bench for a 4\u20132 defeat away to AFC Bournemouth in April. By November, Brown had played just six minutes of first-team football, in the League Cup second round, and Rowett had spoken publicly of his lack of professionalism in matters such as punctuality. His application improved, and on 21 November, he made his first appearance in the Championship for more than a year, as a 72nd-minute substitute with Birmingham 1\u20130 down at home to Charlton Athletic. Having had no more first-team involvement, Brown joined Premier League club West Ham United on trial in January 2016, and made a promising appearance in a development squad match against Brighton & Hove Albion. He also spent time with AFC Bournemouth, and was reported to have attracted interest from Manchester City. In March, Birmingham City suspended Brown pending the outcome of an internal investigation into his \"conduct and levels of professionalism.\" He returned to the development squad and, according to Rowett, he was working harder. At the end of April, the club offered him another year on his contract, which was due to expire; he signed the extension in June. Brown was not included in the first-team training camp in Spain, reportedly because Rowett \"wanted him to work for his opportunities\", but his pre-season performances earned him a place on the bench for the opening fixture of the new Championship season, at home to Cardiff City. He replaced David Cotterill after 71 minutes, and came close to creating a winning goal when he cut the ball back for debutant Jack Storer who narrowly failed to touch it past the goalkeeper; the match finished goalless. In September, Brown made his first start for Birmingham in two-and-a-half years, in a 2\u20132 draw away to Preston North End. He took his appearance total for the season to eight before Rowett was replaced as manager by Gianfranco Zola; thereafter, his only outing was as a second-half substitute in a losing cause away to Newcastle United in the FA Cup."

He played regularly, mainly in the number ten role, finishing the season with 42 appearances in all competitions, and the club took up their option to extend his contract for a further year. In the 2018\u201319 season he was used in a deeper role with more positional freedom which, according to the Stroud News & Journal sports reporter, bore witness to his increased willingness and ability to cope with the more physical side of the game. He added goalscoring to his game; in March, he scored five and was involved in all seven of Forest Green's goals, a performance that earned him the EFL League Two Player of the Month award. He finished the season with double figures of both goals and assists from 52 appearances in all competitions, securing himself a place in the PFA League Two Team of the Year and contributing to Forest Green's play-off spot; they lost to Tranmere Rovers in the semi-final, Brown's last appearance with Forest Green."

Johansson recorded his first NHL win on 23 February 2020, 2\u20131 against the Winnipeg Jets. With the following North American season delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 31 October 2020, Johansson was loaned by the Sabres to German club, Krefeld Pinguine of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), until the commencement of NHL training camp. Before joining Krefeld, the DEL was later delayed due to the pandemic and Johansson returned to the Sabres. On 20 March 2021, Johansson was traded to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick. The trade was delayed by a day as the Sabres waited to receive the results of several COVID-19 tests. Following the trade, John Vogl, the Sabres beat writer for The Athletic, called Johansson the worst goaltender he had seen in nineteen years of covering the Sabres. With the Avalanche, Johansson finished the regular season with a 5\u20131\u20131 record, including a win in their season finale against the Los Angeles Kings. He remained with the Avalanche through the playoffs without making an appearance, serving games as the backup while later among the black aces as the club's third choice goaltender. On 29 June 2021, Johansson as a pending free agent opted to continue within the Avalanche organization, agreeing to a one-year, two-way contract extension. On 13 December, Johansson was claimed off waivers by the Florida Panthers."

Fisher made his debut as an H-back against the Pittsburgh Steelers during the 2015\u20132016 playoffs. After the season, Fisher switched back to number 74 and began taking reps at center during the Bengals' training camp. With the departure of right tackle Andre Smith, Fisher was the back-up right tackle going into the 2016 regular season. He showed his versatility, getting acquainted with all five offensive line positions. Fisher came into 2017 as the Bengals' starting right tackle. He started seven out of eight games before leaving midway through the team's Week 9 matchup against the Jaguars. He left with an apparent illness that sent him to the hospital. He was placed on the reserve/non-football illness list on November 8, 2017. The next day, he was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat and had a procedure to correct the issue. Fisher entered the 2018 season as a backup tackle after the Bengals acquired Cordy Glenn in a trade to be their left tackle and signed Bobby Hart to be their right tackle. He made his first and only start of the season in Week 12 at left tackle in place of an injured Glenn. He suffered a back injury in the game and was placed on injured reserve on November 29, 2018.
