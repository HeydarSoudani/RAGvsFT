        "content": "Evan is a Welsh given name derived from Iefan, a Welsh form of the name John. Similar names that share this origin include Ivan, Ian, and Juan. \"John\" itself is derived from the ancient Hebrew name \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05b9\u05d5\u05d7\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05df\u200e (romanised: Y\u0259h\u00f4\u1e25\u0101n\u0101n), meaning \"Yahweh is gracious\". Evan can also occasionally be found as a shortened version of Greek names like Evangelos and Evander. While mostly male, the name is also given to women, as with the actress Evan Rachel Wood or American Cabinet Secretary Evan Ryan. It may also be encountered as a surname, although Evans is a far more common form within this context.\nOther languages possess words and names ostensibly similar to Evan, such as E\u00f3gan in Scottish Gaelic and Irish, Owain in Welsh, and Owen in English. However, these names are altogether different etymologically, generally thought to come from the Greek and Latin word eugen\u0113s, which means \"noble\" or \"well-born\"."

Immediately afterward, however, it began to decline precipitously, dropping out of the top 50 male names in the US by 2013 and out of the top 100 by 2020.

        "content": "Il ritorno di Tobia (The Return of Tobias) is an oratorio in two parts composed in 1775 by Joseph Haydn (Hob. XXI:1). The work is the first oratorio the composer wrote and, according to Jones, was \"his most extended and ambitious composition up to that time\".The Italian-language libretto of the work is by Giovanni Gastone Boccherini, brother of the composer Luigi Boccherini. This libretto is harshly criticized by Olleson, who notes that the author de-dramatizes vivid episodes in the source (the story of Tobit in the Apocrypha), depriving Haydn of the opportunity for highly dramatic musical utterance.The work was premiered in Vienna on 2 April 1775, under the sponsorship of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, a musician's benevolent society. The musical forces were substantial: Smither writes: \"characteristic of the large forces used for the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t concerts, the orchestra, chorus, and soloists possibly numbered more than 180 performers.\" He adds that the premiere was \"enormously successful.\"In 1784, Haydn substantially revised the work, with cuts to make numbers shorter and new choruses, for another of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t's benefit concerts. It is thought that at this concert Haydn first met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who became his good friend. One of the soprano soloists was Nancy Storace, also a friend of Haydn, who later was Mozart's first Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro.In 1808 the oratorio made a third appearance on the program of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, this time in a revised version by the now-elderly composer's pupil, Sigismund Neukomm. The performance on the night of 22 December, which required the labors of most of the highly qualified musicians in Vienna, had regrettable consequences for a now-famous rival concert taking place in Vienna on the same evening, the benefit for Ludwig van Beethoven that premiered his Fifth and Sixth Symphonies.\nToday, Il ritorno di Tobia is eclipsed by Haydn's later works in this genre \u2013 The Creation and The Seasons \u2013 and is seldom performed or recorded."

As well as evoking the film Them!, \"Ants Invasion\" mentions a 'Forbidden Zone' as in the 1968 film of Planet of the Apes (a theme returned to on the following year's \"Picasso Visita el Planeta de los Simios\"). \"Killer In The Home\" quotes Apocalypse Now in its lyrics. \"The Magnificent Five\" homages The Magnificent Seven, and quotes Friedrich Nietzsche. \"Don't Be Square (Be There)\" refers to an earlier, unreleased Adam and the Ants song, which itself obliquely referenced the actor Dirk Bogarde. \"Jolly Roger\" is musically identical with the theme to Seven Guns for the MacGregors, composed by Ennio Morricone. \"Making History\" quotes Night of the Living Dead. \"The Human Beings\" lyrical content consists almost entirely of the chanted names of Native American tribes Blackfoot, Pawnee, Cheyenne, Crow, and the name of Goklayeh, a Bedonkohe Apache leader."

It was Radiohead's first release after their recording contract with EMI ended with their album Hail to the Thief (2003).\nRadiohead began work on In Rainbows in early 2005. In 2006, after their sessions with the producer Spike Stent proved fruitless, they re-enlisted their longtime producer, Nigel Godrich. Radiohead recorded in the country houses Halswell House and Tottenham House, the Hospital Club in London, and their studio in Oxfordshire, using conventional rock instrumentation plus electronic instruments, strings, piano and the ondes Martenot. The lyrics are less political and more personal than previous Radiohead albums.\nRadiohead released In Rainbows online and allowed fans to set their own price, saying this liberated them from conventional promotional formats and removed barriers to audiences. It was the first such release by a major act and drew international media attention. Many praised Radiohead for challenging old models and finding new ways to connect with fans, while others felt it set a dangerous precedent at the expense of less successful artists.\nRadiohead promoted In Rainbows with webcasts, music videos, competitions and a worldwide tour. \"Jigsaw Falling into Place\" and \"Nude\" were released as singles; \"Nude\" became Radiohead's first US top-40 song since their debut single \"Creep\" (1992). The retail release of In Rainbows topped the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200, and by October 2008 it had sold over three million copies worldwide. It was the bestselling vinyl record of 2008, and is certified platinum in the UK and Canada and gold in the US, Belgium and Japan. In Rainbows received acclaim, winning Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package, and was ranked one of the best albums of the year and the decade by various publications. Rolling Stone included In Rainbows in its updated lists of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time."

As Hail to the Thief was the final album released under their record contract with EMI, they had no contractual obligation to release new material. The drummer, Philip Selway, said Radiohead still wanted to create music, but took a break to focus on other areas of their lives, and that the end of their contract provided a natural point to pause and reflect. The New York Times described Radiohead as \"by far the world's most popular unsigned band\".In 2005, the singer and songwriter, Thom Yorke, appeared on the web series From the Basement, performing the future In Rainbows tracks \"Videotape\", \"Down is the New Up\" and \"Last Flowers\". He released his first solo album, The Eraser, in 2006. The lead guitarist, Jonny Greenwood, also composed his first solo works, the soundtracks Bodysong (2004) and There Will Be Blood (2007)."

        "content": "In March 2005, Radiohead began writing and recording in their Oxfordshire studio. They initially chose to work without their longtime producer, Nigel Godrich. According to the guitarist Ed O'Brien, \"We were a little bit in the comfort zone ... We've been working together for 10 years, and we all love one another too much.\" The bassist, Colin Greenwood, later denied this, saying Godrich had been busy working with Charlotte Gainsbourg and Beck. At the Ether festival in July 2005, Jonny Greenwood and Yorke performed a version of the future In Rainbows track \"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\" with the London Sinfonietta orchestra and the Arab Orchestra of Nazareth.\nRegular recording sessions began that August, with Radiohead updating fans on their progress intermittently on their new blog, Dead Air Space. The sessions were slow, and the band struggled to regain confidence. According to Yorke, \"We spent a long time in the studio just not going anywhere, wasting our time, and that was really, really frustrating.\" They attributed their slow progress to a lack of momentum after their break, the lack of deadline and producer, and the fact that all the members had become fathers.In December 2005, Radiohead hired the producer Spike Stent, who had worked with artists including U2 and Bj\u00f6rk, to help them work through their material. Stent listened to their self-produced work and agreed that it was subpar. However, the collaboration with Stent was unsuccessful.Concerned by the lack of progress, Radiohead's management suggested they break up. Brian Message, one of their managers, said later: \"You have to be honest if it's not working. You have to have passion about what you do.\" O'Brien said Radiohead decided to continue because \"when you got beyond all the shit and the bollocks, the core of these songs were really good\". He felt In Rainbows could be the final Radiohead record, and was motivated by a desire to secure their status as a great band.In an effort to break the deadlock, Radiohead decided to tour for the first time since 2004. They performed in Europe and North America in May and June 2006, and returned to Europe for several festivals in August, performing many new songs. According to Yorke, the tour forced them to finish writing the songs. He said: \"Rather than it being a nightmare, it was really, really good fun, because suddenly everyone is being spontaneous and no one's self-conscious because you're not in the studio ... It felt like being 16 again.\""

        "content": "In Rainbows incorporates elements of art rock, experimental rock, alternative rock, art pop, and electronica. O'Brien said Radiohead were hesitant to create an \"epic\" record, which they felt had negative associations of stadium rock. However, he conceded that \"epic is also about beauty, like a majestic view, and what we did on this record was to allow the songs to be epic when they have to be\". He gave \"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\" as an example of a song that was \"obviously epic in scope\". Yorke said Radiohead considered In Rainbows  \"our classic album, our Transformer, our Revolver, our Hunky Dory\".The opening track, \"15 Step\", features a handclap rhythm inspired by \"Fuck the Pain Away\" by Peaches. Radiohead recorded cheers by a group of children from the Matrix Music School & Arts Centre in Oxford. \"Bodysnatchers\", which Yorke described as a combination of Wolfmother, Neu! and \"dodgy hippy rock\", was recorded when he was in a period of \"hyperactive mania\". On \"All I Need\", Jonny Greenwood wanted to capture the white noise generated by a band playing loudly in a room, which never occurs in the studio. His solution was to have a string section play every note of the scale, blanketing the frequencies.Radiohead recorded a version of \"Nude\" during the sessions for their 1997 album OK Computer, but discarded it. This version featured a Hammond organ, a \"straighter\" feel, and different lyrics. For the In Rainbows version, Colin Greenwood wrote a new bassline, which Godrich said \"transformed it from something very straight into something that had much more of a rhythmic flow\". \"Reckoner\" developed while Radiohead were working on another song, \"FeelingPulledApartByHorses\". It features Yorke's falsetto, \"frosty, clanging\" percussion, a \"meandering\" guitar line, piano, and a string arrangement by Jonny Greenwood. Yorke described it as \"a love song... sort of\".Yorke described the process of composing \"Videotape\" as \"absolute agony\", and said it \"went through every possible parameter\". He initially wanted it to be a \"post-rave trance track\", similar to the music of Surgeon, and said Jonny Greenwood was \"obsessed\" with shifting the start of the bar. Radiohead performed \"Videotape\" a more conventional rock arrangement on tour in 2006, with Selway's drums building to a climax. For the album, Godrich and Greenwood reduced the song to a minimal piano ballad with percussion from a Roland TR-909 drum machine."

Donwood worked in the studio while Radiohead worked on the album, allowing the artwork to convey the mood of the music. He displayed images in the studio and on the studio computer for the band to interact with and comment on. He also posted images daily on the Radiohead website, though none were used in the final artwork.Donwood experimented with photographic etching, putting prints into acid baths and throwing wax at paper, creating images influenced by NASA space photography. He originally planned to explore suburban life, but realised it did not fit the album, saying: \"The music took a different direction and became much more organic, sensual and sexual, so I started working with wax and syringes.\" He described the final artwork as \"very colourful ... It's a rainbow but it is very toxic, it's more like the sort of one you'd see in a puddle.\" Radiohead did not release the cover for the digital release, preferring to hold it back for the physical release.

It was suggested by Radiohead's managers, Bryce Edge and Chris Hufford, in April 2007. According to Selway, \"Because [the album] was taking quite long, our management were twiddling thumbs at points and they were just coming up with ideas. And this was one that really stuck.\" Colin Greenwood explained the release as a way of avoiding the \"regulated playlists\" and \"straitened formats\" of radio and TV, ensuring listeners around the world would experience the music at the same time and preventing leaks in advance of a physical release. He said that the decision had not been made for financial gain, and that if money had been Radiohead's motivation they would have accepted an offer from Universal Records."

The Guardian critic Alexis Petridis praised Radiohead's performance in the studio and said they sounded like they were enjoying themselves. Billboard's Jonathan Cohen commended the album for not being overshadowed by its marketing hype. Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that In Rainbows \"will hopefully be remembered as Radiohead's most stimulating synthesis of accessible songs and abstract sounds, rather than their first pick-your-price download\".NME described In Rainbows as \"Radiohead reconnecting with their human sides, realising you [can] embrace pop melodies and proper instruments while still sounding like paranoid androids ... This [is] otherworldly music, alright.\" Will Hermes, writing in Entertainment Weekly, called In Rainbows \"the gentlest, prettiest Radiohead set yet\" and stated that it \"uses the full musical and emotional spectra to conjure breathtaking beauty\". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised its \"vividly collaborative sonic touches\" and concluded: \"No wasted moments, no weak tracks: just primo Radiohead.\"Jon Dolan of Blender called In Rainbows \"far more pensive and reflective\" than Hail to the Thief, writing that it \"formulates a lush, sensualised ideal out of vague, layered discomfort\". Spin's Mikael Wood felt that it \"succeeds because all of that cold, clinical lab work hasn't eliminated the warmth from their music\", while Pitchfork's Mark Pytlik wrote it was a more \"human\" album that \"represents the sound of Radiohead coming back to earth\". Robert Christgau, writing for MSN Music, gave In Rainbows a two-star honourable mention and wrote that it was \"more jammy, less songy and less Yorkey, which is good\". The Wire was more critical, finding \"a sense here of a group magisterially marking time, shying away ... from any grand, rhetorical, countercultural purpose\".In 2011, The Rolling Stone Album Guide described In Rainbows as Radiohead's \"most expansive and seductive album, possibly their all-time high\". In 2023, Selway said it was his favourite Radiohead album. He said it combined \"everything that we'd been learning over two decades, and it seemed to land in quite a concise way ... It feels like a band that have learned to play their instruments together but have been able to spend long enough doing that so the playing reaches a new level.\""

Now they are inextricably linked with each other.\nCarried away by the suddenly discovered prospects, the desire to go deeper into the skin of the hired killer, Anton loses all vigilance and the mysterious and cruel \"Ghost\" substitutes him. It turns out that the \"mark\" Anton was amusing himself with was the contract of \"Ghost\". And at the last stage of the scenario the killer murders the \"mark\" for real ... with the help of the same pistol with which Anton learned to shoot. All the evidence points to the writer. Now the police and bandits immediately rush in pursuit of Anton. Having kidnapped the agitated Anton, the \"Ghost\" takes him to some hovel outside the city, chains him up and threatening with reprisals against his relatives forces him to finish the book he started. While the writer is busy with this, the killer \"disposes\" of all witnesses and then goes to kill Anton. \"Ghost\" unfastens the writer and sets the house on fire. Exhausted Anton manages to hit \"Ghost's\" head and runs out into the street. When he runs a distance, the house explodes.\nAll charges have been dropped from Anton. The charred corpse found in the house is buried in a semi-abandoned cemetery somewhere outside the city. After some time, Anton, who became famous and revered thanks to a new book about the \"Ghost\", sees through a window a familiar silhouette at a book signing. In a panic, Anton leaves everything and hurries back to his relatives. Having made sure of their safety, Anton walks with them along the lake shore. One time the killer told Prachenko that it is possible to \"carry out\" any mark. It is more difficult to get away from persecution. After some time when Anton and his family leave, someone comes to the shore of the lake and feeds the birds. There is no doubt that the \"Ghost\" is alive and that the explosion of the house was just a dramatization of death, arranged in the spirit of Machiavelli. From now on, Anton's life will be completely different from the past. He will never forget the words of the killer: \"You are not alone in the street ...\"."

Players control a young boy and must travel around the game world interacting with non-player characters and challenging them to card battles using 60-card decks. During gameplay, the player must defeat eight Club Masters, each with a different deck representing one of the game's elemental card types. Finally, the player faces four Grand Masters, and defeating them earns the player the right to inherit four powerful Legendary Cards. A total of 226 cards exist within the game, which include cards from the first three sets of the real-life game, as well as exclusive cards not available outside of the game. The player is given the opportunity to choose one of three starter decks at the start of their journey, each containing Pok\u00e9mon cards revolving around the three possible starting creatures from Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue. As players defeat opponents, they are rewarded with booster packs containing a random assortment of additional cards they may use in their deck, with up to four separate decks able to be saved at a time.\nUp to two players may interact with each other using the Game Boy's infrared and/or Link Cable to battle or trade cards. As players trade with one another, they are given access to a special feature called \"Card Pop!\", which allows them to obtain cards that would otherwise be inaccessible in the main game. This feature is not accessible in the 3DS version."

The cards were excluded as it was difficult to translate their tabletop effects to the video game engine, but they are replaced by game-exclusive cards of the same Pok\u00e9mon (the Electrode card was later made available in Japan via an online card shop).

GameSpot referred to the game as \"a faithful and amusing adaptation of the collectible card game\" calling the gameplay \"addictive\", but found it to be overall less satisfying than the original Pok\u00e9mon role-playing games, stating that its goal of 'collecting all 226 pieces of paper' just doesn't satisfy like 'catching 'em all' can and does.\" Others, such as IGN called the game \"a blast to play\" and that it offered mostly the same experience as the tabletop version \"without the clutter or cost\", yet acknowledged that the video game adaption could not fully replicate the original given the finite number of cards available. Though the website found its main story to be \"simple and basic\", and gameplay to be largely luck-based, it ultimately declared that \"whether you like or hate those darn Pok\u00e9mon... if Nintendo keeps making Pok\u00e9mon videogames of this quality, those creatures aren't going away anytime soon.\" GamesRadar ranked it the 50th best game available on the Game Boy and/or Game Boy Color. The staff called it an \"excellent addition to Pokemon's Game Boy catalog.\"In a 2009 retrospective of Pok\u00e9mon spin-offs, IGN retained their high praise for the game, stating \"It was really kind of ridiculous how awesome this game turned out to be...if there was one spin-off [we] could ask Nintendo to reintroduce, it'd be the TCG game.\""

The first magazine was published at the end of 1983 and was such a success that the number of copies were insufficient on the market. Another spinoff for teenagers, Science & Vie Junior was started in 1986. It was first published by Excelsior Publications until the latter was bought by Emap Plc in 2003. In June 2006 the magazine became part of Mondadori France. In July 2019, the magazine was sold to Reworld Media.\nScience & Vie was divided in three sections, Science (Sciences), Technologie (Technology), Vie Pratique (Daily life). While the Science section reported on recent scientific progress, the Technology section would report on recent technical advances. Science & Vie covered technical advances in industry, but also in military technology. In particular, it featured articles on explosives, firearms, chemical weapons and nuclear weapons. The Vie Pratique section was concerned with technology in daily life. It included articles on photography, personal computers, video recording equipment or television. Besides these three sections, Science & Vie contained a section on amateur electronics by Henri-Pierre Penel, a section on amateur astronomy La Calculette de l'Astronome, and two sections on computer programming in BASIC, one on video games (first for the Sinclair ZX81, and then the ZX Spectrum) and another of elementary numerical analysis, Le Micro de l'Ing\u00e9nieur (with listings for the Apple II). This made Science & Vie a more popular magazine (both in terms of circulation and\nin terms of the level of education of its readers) than La Recherche or Pour la Science which are only concerned with science, or Industries & Techniques which only deals with applications of technology in industry.\nAnother important distinctive feature of Science & Vie was its willingness to tackle the issue of pseudoscience. The magazine was very critical of astrology, homeopathy, and pseudoscience. With the help of magician G\u00e9rard Majax, it has exposed the tricks used by Uri Geller to bend spoons and make small objects fly. In 1989, it strongly criticized the claims of Jacques Benveniste of having observed water memory. The magazine also uncovered the fabrication of the autopsy of an alien body supposedly discovered in Roswell, New Mexico. The magazine was also very supportive of Henri Broch's debunking of paranormal claims. In general, articles on paranormal topics were marked as Blurgs, an acronym for Balivernes lamentables \u00e0 l'usage r\u00e9serv\u00e9 des gogos (\"deplorable nonsense reserved for use by the gullible\"). Since being bought by Mondadori, the magazine has adopted a less skeptical line.In 2004 Science & Vie sold 361,273 copies. In 2010 the circulation of the magazine was 281,000 copies."

His earliest influences included the sound of early British bands, such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, influenced by popular American rhythm and blues. At the same time, folk influences from artists such as Bob Dylan and Simon & Garfunkel left a strong mark on him, along with some of the musicals being performed so close to his childhood home in Soho that he could often hear them drifting through his room. Stevens's older brother, David Gordon, attracted the attention of music producer Mike Hurst, formerly of the Springfields, in the hope of finding a producer interested in his younger brother's music. After a demo was recorded, a deal was struck between the two. The album was not released until 1967; however, recording began on 10 July 1966, with a few advance singles appearing around that time."

It was initially recorded only by Stevens' guitars, piano and vocals. Hurst, however, encouraged Stevens to add a staccato and tympani\u2013and\u2013viola arrangement. Session bassist John Paul Jones played on the first singles two years before becoming a member of Led Zeppelin. The lyrics for the B-side of the first single, \"Portobello Road\", were written by Kim Fowley, who encouraged Stevens to compose a melody for the song. The single initially reached No. 28 on the UK charts, followed by \"Matthew and Son\", the next single and title track, which went to No. 2 on the UK charts, making Stevens into a popular and clean-cut teenage crooner."

AllMusic's Bruce Eder gave it three-and-a-half out of five stars and said that \"it's very distant from the sound that Stevens was ultimately known for, and in many ways, it's more dated than what he did for Island/A&M, but it's much more self-consciously accessible, arranged in different styles\"."

        "content": "The history of L'Indice begins in October 1984, with the literary critic Cesare Cases\u2019s words about what a book review is expected to achieve: \u00abThe essential is that the first moment, that is the description of a book\u2019s contents, shall have the centrality it deserves. Connivance to the reader should not be established ... on the basis of specialistic interest nor by formal flatteries; contents only can ground it ... The essential is that the reader should get from the description of contents a clear idea of what the book is and of the reasons of its importance, those which have induced us to prefer it to others\u00bb.In its twenty-eight years of existence, L'Indice has always remained faithful to this program. It has documented the Italian book production through reviews and notices, along with surveys, columns, interviews and articles of different sorts. Each of its editors has left his own mark on the review: Gian Giacomo Migone (1984\u201390) and Cesare Cases (1990\u20131994) have contributed to specify the original project, whose recognizable physiognomy is indissolubly associated with Tullio Pericoli's portraits and graphics, as well as with Franco Matticchio's drawings. Alberto Papuzzi (1994\u20131999) brought special attention to the relationship between cinema and literature/essays. Under Luca Rastello's (2000\u20132001) guidance, L'Indice inaugurated a new column, \"Segnali\" (Signals), focusing on cultural and political changes, as well as knotty issues in the society we live in. Mimmo C\u00e0ndito (2001-) has enriched L'Indice with \u201cVillaggio globale\u201d (Global Village), hosting correspondents who write about books production in Europe and worldwide."

Starting from apparently national, country-specific interventions, the journal aimed at emphasizing the inherent unity of the European culture in a critical historical moment of the integration process, addressing specialists and the wider public at the same time. Along with L'Indice, The Times Literary Supplement, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Le Monde and El Pa\u00eds sponsored the project. A 24-pages quarterly multinational literary journal called \u201cLiber. Revue europ\u00e9enne des livres\u201d (\u201cLiber. European Review of Books\u201d) \u2013 deliberately playing upon the ambiguity intrinsic to the Latin root, which means both \u201cbook\u201d and \u201cfree\u201d \u2013 was therefore published in the biennium 1989-90 (its first issue was presented at the Frankfurt Book Fair of October 1989), with a combined circulation of over one million. The editor was Pierre Bourdieu. Jeremy Treglown (then editor of The Times Literary Supplement), Frank Schirrmarcher (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung) and Thomas Ferenczi (Le Monde) joined Migone and Bourdieu in the editorial board. After five editions, \u201cLiber\u201d became a supplement of Bourdieu\u2019s publication Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales."

It was Peadar Mercier's album debut on bodhran and Se\u00e1n Keane's on fiddle.\nWhen Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada disbanded Ceoltoiri Chualann in 1969, several of the players wanted to continue the sound they had pioneered. The result was the reformation of The Chieftains. \"The Foxhunt\" had previously been known as a piper's tune, but here it was given a full band treatment, and was widely played, as a direct result of this recording."

        "content": "Am\u00e9lie Poulain is born in 1974 and brought up by eccentric parents who \u2013 incorrectly believing that she has a heart defect \u2013 decide to home-school her. To cope with her loneliness, Am\u00e9lie develops an active imagination and a mischievous personality. When Am\u00e9lie is six, her mother, Amandine, is killed when a suicidal Canadian tourist jumps from the roof of Notre-Dame de Paris and lands on her. As a result, her father, Rapha\u00ebl, withdraws more and more from society. Am\u00e9lie leaves home at the age of 18 and becomes a waitress at the Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins in Montmartre, which is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. She is single and lets her imagination roam freely, finding contentment in simple pleasures like dipping her hand into grain sacks, cracking cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with a spoon, and skipping stones along the Canal Saint-Martin.On 31 August 1997, startled by the news of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, Am\u00e9lie drops a plastic perfume-stopper, which dislodges a wall tile and accidentally reveals an old metal box which contains childhood memorabilia hidden by a boy who lived in her apartment decades earlier. Am\u00e9lie resolves to track down the boy and return the box to him. She promises herself that if it makes him happy, she will devote her life to bringing happiness to others.\nAfter asking the apartment's concierge and several old tenants about the boy's identity, Am\u00e9lie meets her reclusive neighbour, Raymond Dufayel, an artist with brittle bone disease who replicates Pierre-Auguste Renoir's 1881 painting Luncheon of the Boating Party every year. He recalls the boy's name as \"Bretodeau\". Am\u00e9lie finds the man, Dominique Bretodeau, and surreptitiously gives him the box. Moved to tears by the discovery and the memories it holds, Bretodeau resolves to reconcile with his estranged daughter and the grandson he has never met. Am\u00e9lie happily embarks on her new mission.\nAm\u00e9lie secretly executes complex schemes that positively affect the lives of those around her. She escorts a blind man to the M\u00e9tro station while giving him a rich description of the street scenes he passes. She persuades her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his garden gnome and having a flight attendant friend mail pictures of it posing with landmarks from all over the world. She starts a romance between her hypochondriacal co-worker Georgette and Joseph, a patron of the cafe. She convinces Madeleine Wallace, the concierge of her block of flats, that the husband who abandoned her had sent her a final conciliatory love letter just before his accidental death years before. She plays practical jokes on Collignon, the nasty greengrocer. Mentally exhausted, Collignon no longer abuses his meek, good-natured assistant Lucien. A delighted Lucien subsequently takes charge at the grocery stand.\nDufayel, having observed Am\u00e9lie, begins a conversation with her about his painting. Although he has copied the same Renoir painting 20 times, he has never quite captured the look of the girl drinking a glass of water. They discuss the meaning of this character, and over several conversations, Am\u00e9lie begins projecting her loneliness onto the image. Dufayel recognizes this and uses the girl in the painting to push Am\u00e9lie to examine her attraction to a quirky young man, Nino Quincampoix, who collects the discarded photographs of strangers from passport photo booths. When Am\u00e9lie bumps into Nino a second time, she realizes she is falling in love with him. He accidentally drops a photo album in the street. Am\u00e9lie retrieves it.\nAm\u00e9lie plays a cat-and-mouse game with Nino around Paris before returning his treasured album anonymously. After arranging a meeting at the 2 Moulins, Am\u00e9lie panics and tries to deny her identity. Her co-worker, Gina, concerned for Am\u00e9lie's well-being, screens Nino for her; Joseph's comment about this misleads Am\u00e9lie to believe she has lost Nino to Gina. It takes Dufayel's insight to give her the courage to pursue Nino, resulting in a romantic night together and the beginning of a relationship. The film ends as Am\u00e9lie experiences a moment of happiness she has found for herself."

In that first draft, Am\u00e9lie's father was an Englishman living in London. However, Watson's French was not strong, and when she became unavailable to shoot the film, owing to a conflict with the filming of Gosford Park (2001), Jeunet rewrote the screenplay for a French actress. Audrey Tautou was the first actress he auditioned having seen her on the poster for the 1999 film Venus Beauty Institute.\nFilming took place mainly in Paris. The Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins (15 Rue Lepic, Montmartre, Paris) where Am\u00e9lie works is a real place.The filmmakers made use of computer-generated imagery (including computer animation), and a digital intermediate. The studio scenes were filmed in the MMC Studios Coloneum in Cologne (Germany). The film shares many of the themes in its plot with the second half of the 1994 film Chungking Express."

The absence of Am\u00e9lie at the festival caused something of a controversy because of the warm welcome by the French media and audience in contrast with the reaction of the selector.

The king's uncles were Prince Bi Gan, Prince Jizi, and Prince Weizi. Together the three princes were known as \"The Three Kind-Hearted Men of Shang\" in the kingdom. Prince Bi Gan was the son of King Wen Ding; he was the brother of King Zhou's father and, thus, was King Zhou's uncle, and served as the prime minister of the Kingdom of Shang.\nKing Zhou was a cruel king, but his three uncles could not persuade him to change his ways. Failing in their duty to advise the king, Prince Weizi resigned. Prince Jizi faked insanity and was relieved of his post. Only Prince Bi Gan stayed on to continue advising the king to change his ways. \"Servants who are afraid of being killed and refrain from telling the truth are not righteous\" he said. This put him in danger of incurring the king's wrath. Prince Bi Gan stayed at the palace for three days and nights to try to persuade the blood-thirsty and immoral king to mend his ways.The stubborn king would not relent and had Prince Bi Gan arrested for treason. Upon hearing this, his pregnant wife escaped into the forest and went into labor there. With no one to help her, she gave birth to a boy in the rocky cave in the forest, in a place called Chang Lin (\u9577\u6797).\nBefore long, King Zhou of Shang was overthrown by Ji Fa, the Count of the West (Western Shang). Ji Fa established a new dynasty named the Zhou dynasty and became the King Wu of Zhou. King Wu knew about the courageous prime minister Prince Bi Gan and sought his wife and child. When he found them, he honoured them in respect of Prince Bi Gan. The mother and child were restored to the Shang royal family. King Wu of Zhou conferred the surname Lin (meaning forest) and the Dukedom of Bo'ling on Prince Bi Gan's son, Lin (Lim/Lam) Jian (\u6797\u575a), ennobled as the Duke of Bo'ling."

It quickly outgrew its initial purpose as a bi-weekly listing magazine and ended up having a profound effect on Moscow\u2019s cultural and nightlife scene.  In the next 10 years Afisha turned into a Russia's leading publishing house by launching an array of spin-off publications such as monthly travel magazine Afisha-Mir, alternative weekly Bolshoy Gorod, food magazine Afisha-Yeda and a series of Afisha-branded travel guide books.A team of young journalists, designers and photographers brought together by Oskolkov-Tsentsiper created a unique Afisha style which had a major impact on Russian media. Many high-profile Russian artists made their first public appearances on Afisha's front cover and the magazine popularised several new fashion trends \u2013 even introducing numerous new words into the Russian lexicon, from \u201cdeadline\u201d to \u201chipster\u201d. A number of Russia's now prominent cultural figures started their careers writing for Afisha including film directors Avdotya Smirnova, Mikhail Brashinskiy and Roman Volobuev, award-winning writers Lev Danilkin and Yulia Yakovleva and Elena Kovalskaya who went on to become artistic director of Moscow\u2019s Meyerhold Theater.Afisha played an active part in 2011\u20132013 Russian protests with its senior stuff helping to organise rallies in Moscow, publishing manifestos demanding fair election and at some point putting the opposition leader Alexey Navalny on the print edition's cover. A 2013 issue with a rainbow flag on its cover and the story \"27 stories from the lives of Russian gays\" played an important role in the LGBT movement in Russia.In 2014 Afisha's parent company ProfMedia was bought by a Russian state-owned energy corporation Gazprom. Soon after the new owners have shuttered magazine's struggling print edition and fired most of the editorial staff. Plans to relaunch the Afisha as a quarterly were announced but never realized."

The song was a commercial success, and Ellis-Bextor signed to Polydor. She was contacted by director Baz Luhrmann, who offered her a role in the 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, but the singer refused in order to focus on her career as a recording artist. The success of \"Groovejet\" also prompted American musician Moby to notice Ellis-Bextor, and revealed interest in working with her due to her \"amazing\" voice, as he described it. He instructed his record company to \"track\" Ellis-Bextor \"down\" so they could start working as soon as Moby finished his tour. The two ultimately wrote five songs in New York City, which did not make the final cut of Read My Lips. Furthermore, she also recorded with Blur bassist Alex James, as well as former frontman of the New Radicals, Gregg Alexander, while Damian LeGassick was recruited for his programming and keyboard work.The album's title was chosen due to the strong lipstick Ellis-Bextor used for the album artwork, the \"Take Me Home\" music video and \"Read My Lips\" is sung in the opening verse of the album track \"The Universe Is You\". The album photography was shot by Mert Ala\u015f and Marcus Piggot."

The album opener and first single is a cover version of Cher's 1979 song \"Take Me Home\", described as a \"disco groove\". Betty Clarke from The Guardian observed that her voice in the song is reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn's Eliza Doolittle (in the film My Fair Lady). \"Move This Mountain\", co-written by Alex James, is a \"vibrant\" ballad with a trip hop-influenced sound. Following track and second single, \"Murder on the Dancefloor\", is a dance-pop and disco record, that utilises bass guitar and piano in its instrumental. \"Sparkle\" has \"speeding beats and equally speeding keyboards\", while \"Final Move\" contains \"tinny beats\" and \"electro swirls\". The latter was deemed a \"subdued version\" of \"Murder on the Dancefloor\" with \"similar kaleidoscope synth\". \"I Believe\" was described as \"funky\" and \"live-sounding\", while \"Leave the Others Alone\" involves \"cold beats\" and \"big, full-throttle keyboards\". \"By Chance\" was particularly noted for showcasing Ellis-Bextor's accent. Re-release new song \"Get Over You\" is a \"polite\" Euro disco take on \"I Will Survive\"."

He also found that the album's music and the distinctive pronunciation of Ellis-Bextor's vocal delivery did not work to complimentary effect. Betty Clarke from The Guardian described the album as a \"sophisticated package\" but said \"there's little to love and even less fun to be had\". Kelvin Hayes from AllMusic dubbed it \"a disappointing debut from Ellis-Bextor, fusing Human League synth with beats and cinematic strings\", but described \"Murder on the Dancefloor\" as the \"shimmering highlight\" from the album. A critic from entertainment.ie said \"the material on her debut solo album only rarely does justice to her distinctive upper-crust voice\", and said that \"most of the songs sound laboured and plod where they should swing\".In contrast to the previous reviews, Andrew Arora from Blue Coupe had a more positive response to the record. Arora said \"it lands somewhere between Pet Shop Boys' synth-pop faculty and Blondie's Parallel Lines album\", although he claimed that fans of \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" \"should not expect much from this album, but it does deliver a dynamic electro disco sound that is sometimes analogous to her breakthrough-hit single\"."

Director Barbet Schroeder was a fan of Pink Floyd, and brought a rough cut of the film to London for them to work with. Instead of typical background music, Schroeder wanted the songs to feature in the film, such as a record playing at a party. The group also speculated they could branch out into a career as film composers if their recording and touring career did not work out.

        "content": "The album was recorded at Pye Studios in London, in late January and early February 1969 with engineer Brian Humphries. The album was the first to be produced by Pink Floyd without assistance from Norman Smith, who retained an executive producer credit, and the first full album without Syd Barrett, who had been ousted from the group in 1968, during the recording of their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets.Pink Floyd worked out most of the music in two weeks, with material put together quickly and semi-improvised. They did not use a dubbing studio due to budget constraints, and simply timed sequences in the film with a stopwatch so they knew how long the music had to be. Bassist Roger Waters wrote most of the lyrics during breaks between recording backing tracks. Schroeder was impressed by how quickly the group created and recorded the material. Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright co-wrote the instrumental \"Up The Khyber\", the only time the pair were credited as sole co-composers. Barrett's replacement David Gilmour handled all lead vocals on the album.More features a mixture of styles. Songs such as \"Green is the Colour\" were acoustic folk ballads, a genre not often explored by the group. Mason's wife Lindy played penny whistle on the track. The album also contains hard rock, such as \"The Nile Song\" and \"Ibiza Bar\", as well as several instrumental tracks such as \"Quicksilver\" and \"Main Theme\", featuring their experimental and avant-garde approach. \"Cymbaline\" criticised the music industry, with lines such as \"your manager and agent are both busy on the phone\". The version on the album is different from that in the film. Gilmour sings lead on both versions, though Waters is sometimes wrongly credited as singing lead for the film version.\"Green is the Colour\" was played live frequently after release, as a medley with \"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\", as part of a live suite called \"The Journey\". It was a regular feature in the set for two years afterwards. \"Quicksilver\" was played under the title \"Sleeping\" as part of the 1969 live show called \"The Man\", while \"Cymbaline\" was entitled \"Nightmare\". The latter remained part of the group's repertoire until the end of 1971. In live performances, the group left the stage partway through the song while the audience listened to a tape of quadraphonic sound effects including footsteps travelling round the venue, and doors opening. \"Main Theme\" was briefly played live in 1970.Two songs can be heard in the film which were not included on the album: \"Hollywood\" and \"Seabirds\". The latter was published in 1976's The Pink Floyd Songbook. Both songs, as well as two other songs from those sessions, \"Theme (Beat Version)\" and \"More Blues (Alternative Version)\", were released on the 2016 box set, The Early Years 1965\u20131972. The set in which these tracks appear, 1969: Dramatis/ation was made available as a standalone release in 2017. The track called \"Seabirds\" in the box set is not the original song, but an alternative take of \"Quicksilver\".Tracks like \"The Crying Song\" and \"Cymbaline\" play on female lead Mimsy Farmer's transistor radio as she's in her apartment room, and \"Ibiza Bar\" (as the title implies) plays in the background in a bar. These differ from tracks such as \"Up The Khyber\" that plays to the action of the film, in which the band are actual composers, or tracks such as \"Cirrus Minor\" and \"Green is the Colour\" that play to orchestrate the mood of the scene, and these tracks (and others), unlike \"The Crying Song\" and \"Cymbaline\", are not heard by any of the characters."

Popular modern sources typically suggest that the name means \"Little king\", but the original meaning is unknown.

The modern edition follows the traditions of the magazine laid down in 1880 by its founder, Vukol Mikhailovich Lavrov. At the time of its first publications, Russkaya Mysl, (originally: Russian Thought), adhered to moderate constitutionalism \u2013 the idea which paved the way for the ideological and organizational creation of the Cadet Party.\nIn 1918 the magazine was closed by the Bolsheviks as a bourgeois press organ. In 1921\u20131923 it was published in Sofia, Prague and in Berlin. The last issue of Russian Thought, in the format of a magazine, was published in Paris in 1927.\nIn 1947 Russkaya Mysl was revived as a weekly newspaper. The publication was first issued in Paris and did not relocate its headquarters until 2006. In that year, the publishing house settled in London.In 2011, Russkaya Mysl returned to the historical format of 1880, and once again became a magazine. Since 2016, the magazine has been published in English under the title of Russian Mind.Since 2021, the magazine has again been published in Paris. This decision was made by the editorial board of Russian Mind in connection with the exit of Great Britain from the European Union. Russian Mind is a partner of Roszarubezhtsentr under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia in the field of promoting the Russian language, a partner of the Fund for Support and Protection of the Rights of Compatriots Living Abroad.

        "content": "The founder of the magazine Russkaya Mysl, Vukol Mikhailovich Lavrov, was born on September 23, 1852, in a merchant family in the small rural town of Yelets. It is known that he completed only three classes of the parish school, which, however, did not prevent him from reading extensively and becoming a highly educated individual. After meeting with his fellow writers in Moscow, Vukol Lavrov decided to publish his own magazine. Having received permission to publish Russkaya Mysl in 1879, he closed his father\u2019s trading business in Yelets and invested all his funds in the magazine, the first issue of which was published in 1880.\nIn 1880\u20131885 the editor of Russkaya Mysl was Sergey Yuryev who brought it close to the Slavophiliac movement. After Yuryev's death Viktor Goltsev became the editor; under his guidance the magazine made a turn to the left and provided safe haven for many contributors of the recently closed Otechestvennye Zapiski, taking upon itself some of the letter's subscription obligations. This, as well as dropping the standard price from 16 to 12 rubles per issue, helped its popularity rise.\nRusskaya Mysl\u2019s adherence to moderate constitutionalism led to the magazine receiving two warnings: the first \u2013 for the \u2018Petersburg Letters\u2019 in the December issue of 1883, the second \u2013 for the article by V.A. Goltsev \u2018Sociology on an Economic Basis\u2019 in the November issue of 1893. In 1911, the magazine was also criticized by the Church after it published material dedicated to the memory of Leo Nikolaevich Tolstoy. Because of this, Russkaya Mysl was excluded from the dean's library by the pastoral meeting of the Vyazma city clergy.In 1906, after Goltsev's death, Alexander Kisevetter became the editor-in-chief; he invited Pyotr Struve as a co-editor. The magazine started actively discuss latest political, social and religious reforms. Lavrov was still a stuff member but now his works were published not that often. One specific feature of Russkaya Mysl was the Bibliography section which informed the readership of all that was new in Russian literature and journalism. The journal also ran its own The Scientific review and The Modern Art sections, the latter specializing mostly in the Moscow theatrical life.Russkaya Mysl was often called the organ of the Cadet Party, but Struve himself denied this: \u2018The period of certain magazines which tend to represent certain political views, in my opinion, is over. [...] Whether in philosophy or in religion, there should not be a place for \u201cpartisanship\u201d.\u2019After the 1905 revolution, the magazine became more right-wing, while maintaining a constitutional-democratic orientation. Struve fervently supported the February Revolution, but he perceived the October Revolution as a catastrophe for the country and was hostile to the Bolshevik usurpers. In connection with this, the magazine stopped being published in Moscow in 1918. Since 1921, the magazine has continued to be published abroad; but the last of the monthly issues was published in 1927 in Paris.\nAfter a twenty-year break, Russkaya Mysl was brought back into existence, but in the format of a newspaper. The first editor of the new Russkaya Mysl was the pre-revolutionary Russian journalist Vladimir Lazarevsky and, following World War II, the newspaper acquired a new official sponsor in the person of the US State Department.\nThe newspaper positioned itself as a Christian publication in opposition to Marxist publications or those which were being financed by the USSR. Lazarevsky remained the editor-in-chief of the publication until 1953. He was replaced by Sergei Vodov, who headed the editorial office until 1968. During this remarkable period, the publication was authored by extraordinary writers such as Boris Zaitsev, Ivan Bunin, Ivan Shmelev, Nina Berberova, Gaito Gazdanov and many others.\nFrom 1968 to 1978, the newspaper was headed by Zinaida Shakhovskaya. This period saw the emergence of the human rights movement in the USSR. Defending the values of democracy, Russkaya Mysl published works of dissidents. In 1978, Irina Ilovaiskaya-Alberti became the editor-in-chief of Russkaya Mysl. Sergei Grigoryants noted that, with the arrival of the new editor-in-chief, \u2018the newspaper's attention was no longer the news and problems of Russian emigration, but everything that was happening in the Soviet Union (which had already begun to open-up), and most importantly, its dissident democratic movement\u2019.\nDuring this period, representatives of the \u2018third wave\u2019 of emigration and, also, human rights activists, Western Slavists, Sovietologists and dissidents were published in Russkaya Mysl. Such authors and Russian thinkers as Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Joseph Brodsky, Andrei Sakharov, Mikhail Koryakov, Vladimir Maksimov, Natalia Gorbanevskaya, Mikhail Geller, Sergey Dovlatov, Alexander Nekrich, Victor Suvorov and Alain Besancon left a mark on the history of Russkaya Mysl.\nAfter the collapse of the USSR, and the fall of the Iron Curtain, the publication reoriented itself to rallying Russian-speaking communities abroad and restoring ties between compatriots and the Motherland. In 1991 the publication faced severe financial difficulties. Many sponsors, including the United States Department of State, declined to renew the sponsorship-contract. This forced the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Irina Alekseevna Ilovaiskaya-Alberti, to begin to look for new sources of funding. Eventually the Roman Catholic Church and the Soros Foundation announced that they would help the legendary publication to weather those hard times.\nBy the early 2000s, Russkaya Mysl was again on the verge of closure. The editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Irina Vladimirovna Krivova, has described this period as follows: \u2018By 2001, we were completely bankrupt, and they really wanted to close the newspaper. We (several journalists of the newspaper) amassed the money that had been paid to us as redundancy benefits, and we bought the newspaper from our French publisher for the price of the underlying assets. It was impossible to allow Russkaya Mysl to disappear without a trace. For two years, we, the remaining five or six people, worked for free \u2013 writing and editing from home. We said goodbye to our historical premises, in which we had \u201clived\u201d for almost 30 years [\u2026] We lived, one might say, in the attic but, thanks to the authors who supported us completely voluntarily, we managed not to miss a single issue of the newspaper. For two years, I was, literally rushed off my feet in search of funds. I went around all the Parisian publications, and many publishing houses, explaining that Russkaya Mysl had already become part of the historical heritage of France. However, I could not find any support. In the end, the people who showed interest in our publication turned out to be Russian businessmen.\u2019.Since 2005, Victor Lupan has been the head of the editorial board and a regular contributor to Russkaya Mysl. In 2006, within the framework of the \u2018Homecoming\u2019 program, the Parisian archives of the newspaper were donated to the Russian State Library. In the same year, Russkaya Mysl published a collection of the best articles of the newspaper entitled From Stalin to Putin: 60 Years of Russian History. The presentation of the book took place at the 2007 Russian Economic Forum.\nSince 2006, Russkaya Mysl has been published in London as Russian Mind. In 2011, the publication was returned to the historical format of the 1880 magazine. Since 2016, the journal has been published both in Russian and in English. Due to administrative difficulties, which were caused by Brexit, followed by the Pandemic, the board of directors decided to relocate back to Paris and, in 2021, Russian Mind again began to be published there. Now headquartered in 8th district, and continuing to be published monthly, Russian Mind stays true to its mission of being a beam of cultural enrichment for broad-minded individuals."

We are our own politicians, our own government, we have something to say.\nA promo single, \"Where Y'all At\", was released in June 2006 and produced by Salaam Remi. It contained a sample from Nas' \"Made You Look\", but it did not make the final cut for Hip Hop Is Dead. It was, however, released as a bonus track on the Japanese import version of the album.A music video for \"Can't Forget About You\" premiered on February 5, 2007, the song featuring Chrisette Michele and sampling  Nat King Cole's song \"Unforgettable\". Another video, Hustlers, featuring The Game, followed."

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 79, based on 22 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". Nas is hip-hop's \"grumpiest man\", according to Jody Rosen for Entertainment Weekly, and the album \"is a lot like Nas himself: impossible not to admire, but hard to love\". Among those music writers and critics that reviewed Hip Hop Is Dead favorably was Jason Rubin of The A.V. Club, which gave the album an A\u2212 rating. Rubin praised the album's production quality and lyrical concept, and stated \"Hip Hop is unsparing in its diagnosis of rap's ills, but ultimately, it's hopeful. It contains a smart, tight, cohesive analysis of where rap went astray, but also the seeds of the genre's rebirth and renewal.\"Despite perceiving its sound and musical quality as weaknesses, Los Angeles Times writer Soren Baker gave it 3 out of 4 stars and wrote \"Nas demonstrates why he remains one of rap's most revered artists, as his defense of hip-hop culture is impassioned and informed, if not fully realized\". Sean Fennessey of Vibe called the album \"disorienting and sometimes brilliant\" and complimented its \"bold, startling production and a renewed lyrical vigor\". The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, losing to Kanye West's Graduation (2007), at the 50th Grammy Awards in February 2008."

        "content": "The band began experimenting with a new sound when they hired Australian singer-songwriter Carl Groszmann to write a song for them. That song became \"Down the Dustpipe\", released as a non-album single in March 1970, with the Francis Rossi/Rick Parfitt song \"Face Without a Soul\" \u2013 from the band's previous album Spare Parts \u2013 as its B-side. The song, remarked Rossi, \u201cwas the [first] to feature our soon-to-be trademark boogie shuffle\u201d and became one of the most popular numbers in their live set. The single took the media by surprise as it was so different in sound from their previous work. BBC Radio 1 presenter Tony Blackburn dismissed it on-air the first time he played it with the comment, \"Down the dustbin for this one.\" Nevertheless, it was an instant hit, reaching #12 in the UK charts and remaining in the top 50 for 17 weeks.\nOctober 1970 saw the release of another non-album single, the Rossi/Young composition \"In My Chair\", with the non-album B-side \"Gerdundula\" (written while in Germany by Rossi and Young under the pseudonyms Manston and James, with a title reportedly inspired by their German friends Gerd and Ula). It earned the band another hit, reaching #21. \"Gerdundula\" would be rerecorded for their next album, Dog of Two Head.\nWhile on tour the same year, organist Roy Lynes fell in love. He could see how serious the other members were about fame and glory, but wanted to settle down with his newfound love. According to the group's producer, John Schroeder, who wrote the booklet notes for the 3-CD compilation The Early Years, Lynes was \"the quietest member of the group\" and \"somehow always seemed to be the odd one out\". Parfitt has said Lynes was \"a bit laid back, the Open University type who liked tinkering and finding out about things\", and Rossi remarked that, when Lynes showed up at a gig in New Zealand about ten years later to say hello, \"he seemed a much happier bloke.\"\n\"Just so right and so tight,\" observed Pavement's Stephen Malkmus of Ma Kelly's Greasy Spoon. \"As with Dog of Two Head from the year after, this record is transitional: it's the man-steps towards their interchangeable album phase of pure-denim-heads-down-choogle, and never gets boring. Smooth voices over solid grooves. If it was a place, I wish I was there.\""

The performance featured complex choreography and lighting, as well as an overall Japanese inspired theme on the background video screen and with the dancers' costumes. Footage from the performance was later used for the official video clip of the song. After its digital release, the song became a dance hit and has reached number one on the Greek airplay charts as well as the Greek iTunes chart for many weeks.\"Irthes\"\n\nThe second single, and title track of the album, is the ballad \"Irthes\", not to be confused with the same named electropop track of the previous album Iparhi Agapi Edo. \"Irthes\" was released to radio stations on 20 November 2008, and has music by Dimitris Kontopoulos with lyrics by Yiannis Doxas. The song became a moderate hit, peaking at number 18 on the Greek Airplay Chart, however, it is one of Rouvas' lower charting songs. The first music video, directed by Kostas Kapetanidis, premiered two days later and features Rouvas singing in front of a microphone in the studio. A second, more sophisticated music video was released shortly after, directed by La Boo, portraying Rouvas on a dark rural road running away from a woman who is slowly approaching him in a car. The driver shifts into high gear to run him over, although Rouvas super-physically performs a backward flip while propelling himself off the car in midair, thus landing securely behind the car feet-first and fully intact. The driver then turns around and once again chases Rouvas.\"This Is Our Night\"   \n\nThe third single from the album and the first released after the re-release is Rouvas' Eurovision Song Contest 2009 entry \"This Is Our Night\". The song peaked at number one on the Greek Airplay Chart and Greek/International Airplay Chart and for three and two consecutive weeks, respectively; it remained in the top 10 of the former for 10 weeks.\"Ksehna To Prin Kai To Meta\"\n\nThe final single from the album is \"Ksehna To Prin Kai To Meta\".

Initially, D\u00edaz wanted to use songs by Florcita Motuda, but Peirano was inclined to compose them and recommended Pablo Ilabaca, guitarist of the funk rock group Chancho en Piedra at that time, to develop them. Ilabaca showed them a CD with tracks created by him, but that had no place in his band. The first of that sample was the instrumental, \"31 minutos\".

During the recordings of a side project, the creators of 31 minutos went to eat seafood at a local, but the next day it gave both of them hepatitis. Peirano was not as affected as D\u00edaz, who had to rest at his house for a while. In the room where he rested there was a doll, and as a result of the fever generated by the disease he was inspired to write it.On Track 31, after the goodbye of Chancho Irrarazabal there is a Juanin Juan Harry backwards message saying \"Yo enterr\u00e9 a Tulio\" (I Buried Tulio). This is a reference to The Beatles' \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", which contains the supposed backwards message \"I buried Paul\"."

It also helped develop other ideas for the children's block. The Aplaplac production company, owned by D\u00edaz and Peirano, signed a contract with the Agos\u00edn company to launch official products. Among them were stuffed animals, and two best-selling DVDs: Lo mejor de 31 minutos and Los Policarpo Top Top Top Awards, which soon became the best-selling video discs in Chilean history. With this achievement they surpassed Estadio Nacional by Los Prisioneros, a record that held this position in 2002. Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez, vocalist of Los Prisioneros, stated that he was a fan of 31 minutos, and he recorded his own versions of \"Baila sin C\u00e9sar\" and \"Tangananica Tanganan\u00e1\" for the album En las raras tocatas nuevas de la Rock & Pop.Along with all the aforementioned products, the album, 31 minutos, was released under the independent label La Oreja. The album was produced by D\u00edaz and Ilabaca, and was mastered along with dialogues from the episodes and characters. Ten thousand copies were pressed, of which half were reserved by record stores in the country. On July 8, 2023, the day of its release, it sold the remaining copies in less than two hours, obtaining the gold record certification in less than 24 hours. The double-disc prize Platinum was delivered in the conversation program De Pe a Pa, hosted by Pedro Carcuro, for more than 50,000 copies sold. In a few months, it surpassed 120,000 copies sold, becoming a six-times platinum disc, and at the end of 2003, 140,000 copies were already registered, very close to the 160,000 copies sold by the album M\u00e9xico Lindo y Querido by the singer Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Quintanilla, the best-selling album of the year.After its internationalization and broadcast on Channel 11, the record label, EMI Music Mexico reissued the CD for the Mexican Republic in 2007, and Feria Music in 2012 with a different aspect. However, when this last went bankrupt. Aplaplac, the production company of 31 minutos, edited the album independently again, and in November 2014 released the compact for the first time on vinyl, together with the Mexican label No vision. Music factor made it again in this format, in 2016, after being discontinued again. In 2019 and in conversation with the television channel 13C, Pablo Ilabaca detailed the sales of the album until that year: 285,000 copies distributed."

She is not interested in chess, but seems to love his husband very much. At night, the couple invites Mladen to dinner, and the three talk about chess, love and music. Mladen learns that Leda used to study classical music. She knows how to play the piano, but lost the love for doing that a long time ago. They decide to repeat that routine every Sunday, and with time their bond grows stronger.\nBoth Mladen and Neda start showing signs of attraction towards each other. He buys her recordings of musicians performing pieces by Mozart, and the two connect through their love of classical music. One night, during a moment in which they are left alone, he decides to kiss her. Neda does not resist the kiss, but does not comment on it either. At the end of the night, she simply says goodbye to him.\nThings become more tense afterwards. Mladen and Neda start acting more aggressively towards each other, and they are also more distant with Fedja, who starts to suspect something is going on.\nA Sunday, Neda decides to secretly visit Mladen at a bar he frequents. At the same time, Mladen goes to Fedja's apartment to talk things out with her. Despite failing to rendezvous, they both get to talk to Fedja at different moments in the day and notice their behaviour is taking a toll on him.\nNeda starts ignoring Mladen at every chance she gets, so he decides to break the pattern and visit the couple on a Saturday with the excuse of celebrating his birthday. In the ensuing party, Neda confesses to Mladen that she has feelings for him. While a very drunk Fedja is distracted setting up fireworks for the celebration, Neda and Mladen make love.\nRealizing he not only loves Neda but both of his friends, Mladen decides to stop visiting them, not wanting to destroy their marriage. Meanwhile, Neda tells Fedja what happened, and he forgives her.\nA Sunday, Fedja invites Mladen to another afternoon of chess. After the two hash things out, Mladen accepts the invitation. Fedja, Mladen and Neda spend that Sunday like they used to, and resume their relationship."

        "content": "A French knight returning from the Crusades in the Holy Lands probably adopted the surname from \"Saint Jacques\" (or \"James the Greater\"). James the Greater was one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles, and is believed to be the first martyred apostle. Being endowed with this surname was an honor at the time and it is likely that the Church allowed it because of acts during the Crusades. Indeed, at this time, the use of biblical, Christian, or Hebrew names and surnames became very popular, and entered the European lexicon.Robert J., a Knight Crusader in 1248, was the first documented use of the surname. Since then, several personalities who have glorified this surname: Guillaume, secretary of the Duke and auditor of the account in 1413; Thomas, the Archdeacon of Penthievre, the Prior of Pirmil, the Bishop of Leon in 1478, transferred to Dol in 1482, the ambassador of the duke to the Pope in 1486, who died in 1503, and is interred in his cathedral; Jean, the Canon of Dol and Prior of Lehon; Fran\u00e7ois, Lord of the Ville-Carr\u00e9, and the Provost Marshal in 1577; and Captain of Plo\u00ebrmel, who prospered in Rennes in 1621; Bernard, a Rennes counsellor in 1653. The widespread use of surnames was not evident in Europe until the mid-to-late 16th century, and prior usage was restricted to the noble class."

        "content": "The use of surnames reached England during the conquest by an army of Norman, Breton, Flemish, and French soldiers under William the Conqueror. The names became anglicised following the conquest. Over the centuries the spelling of the Jack surname has changed and developed as the French language became increasingly associated with high culture and status. Several European kings have thus adopted the name. Jack appears in the records spelled as Jacques, Jaques, Jack, Jacks, Jackes, Jakes, Jeeks, Jeke, Jeex, Jaquiss, Jaquez and Jaquis, with spelling variations even occurring in documents referring to the same person. There are several explanations for this situation. Latin, as a language used by educated men, and the language of the Anglo-Saxons both had a profound impact on the spelling and pronunciation of Norman names. On the other hand, the Norman language affected the development of English. As the English language developed from its Germanic roots into Middle English (which was influenced by Norman French) we find a period during which spelling was not standardised but roughly followed phonetic pronunciation. During this time names were spelled a variety of ways depending upon local dialects. Thus the surname, as well as the Anglo-Saxon names, were recorded in many different ways."

        "content": "Norman surnames like Jack are sometimes mistakenly considered French, though Normans (a term derived from \"Northmen\"), were of partial Viking origin. In 911, Vikings settled in their namesake region, Normandy, in current day France, where their language merged with that of locals. Throughout this period, England also endured Viking invasions, but the Anglo-Saxons successfully repelled them until 994. When the Danes ruled England, the Saxon royal family lived in Normandy and intermarried with the Duke of Normandy's family. William II, Duke of Normandy, could then claim the English throne when his cousin, Edward the Confessor, the restored Saxon king, died without an heir.\nAt the Battle of Hastings, William's army defeated their rival, King Harold Godwin, who was killed in the engagement. William could then claim the throne as Harold was elected and not a true member of the royal family. Despite the success of the foreign \"conquest,\" English nobles were permitted to retain their land unless they rebelled. Any resisting English elite had their lands confiscated, and some of them fled into exile as a result. William granted lands to his followers and built commanding military strongpoint castles for defence of his realm.  By 1086, more than 92% of English nobles were replaced by William's followers. One of these followers is believed to be an ancestor of the surname, Jack."

At the time of the Doomsday Book in 1086, Nether Silton was recorded as a village with a hall and the tenant-in-chief was the Count of Mortain.The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of William Jagge, from Cambridgeshire dated 1251, in the \"Chartulary of Ramsey Abbey\", during the reign of King Henry III, who was known as \"The Frenchman\", 1216 \u2013 1272, a witness in the Assize Court Rolls of Cambridgeshire in 1260.Katherine Jeke of Wikington in Stafford married Robert Farnham, Lord of Querndon in 1440. The family later acquired estates at Easby Abbey and Elvington. Of this latter branch, Sir Roger Jaques was Lord Mayor of York in 1639, and knighted by King Charles I. Sir John Jacques was also knighted by King Charles I in 1628. The family branched into Middlesex. Mary, daughter of Thomas Jacques of Leeds, married Robert Gosforth of Northumberland in 1818. The present seat of the family is at Easby Abbey.Before the usage of surnames became common, differentiating between generations also led to \u2018son of Jack\u2019 becoming Jackson, most notably with President Andrew Jackson of South Carolina. The Jackson family had immigrated from Ireland during the colonial period. Jackson led American forces at the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812. Due to favorable weather conditions, and his overall leadership, Britain suffered one of her worst defeats in their overseas colonial history. His fame as a general helped him to become the seventh US president later in his life."

Engineered by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), with a team led by Alan Stern, the spacecraft was launched in 2006 with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the Pluto system in 2015, and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or more other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in the decade to follow, which became a mission to 486958 Arrokoth. It is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System.\nOn January 19, 2006, New Horizons was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station by an Atlas V rocket directly into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about 16.26 km/s (10.10 mi/s; 58,500 km/h; 36,400 mph). It was the fastest (average speed with respect to Earth) human-made object ever launched from Earth. It is not the fastest speed recorded for a spacecraft, which, as of 2023, is that of the Parker Solar Probe. After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL, New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter, making its closest approach on February 28, 2007, at a distance of 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles). The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons' speed; the flyby also enabled a general test of New Horizons' scientific capabilities, returning data about the planet's atmosphere, moons, and magnetosphere.\nMost of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve onboard systems, except for brief annual checkouts. On December 6, 2014, New Horizons was brought back online for the Pluto encounter, and instrument check-out began. On January 15, 2015, the spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto.\nOn July 14, 2015, at 11:49 UTC, it flew 12,500 km (7,800 mi) above the surface of Pluto, which at the time was 34 AU from the Sun, making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet. In August 2016, New Horizons was reported to have traveled at speeds of more than 84,000 km/h (52,000 mph). On October 25, 2016, at 21:48 UTC, the last recorded data from the Pluto flyby was received from New Horizons. Having completed its flyby of Pluto, New Horizons then maneuvered for a flyby of Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth (then nicknamed Ultima Thule), which occurred on January 1, 2019, when it was 43.4 AU (6.49 billion km; 4.03 billion mi) from the Sun. In August 2018, NASA cited results by Alice on New Horizons to confirm the existence of a \"hydrogen wall\" at the outer edges of the Solar System. This \"wall\" was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft. NASA has announced it is to extend operations for New Horizons until the spacecraft exits the Kuiper Belt, which is expected to occur between 2028 and 2029."

Appointed as the project's principal investigator, Stern was described by Krimigis as \"the personification of the Pluto mission\". New Horizons was based largely on Stern's work since Pluto 350 and involved most of the team from Pluto Kuiper Express.The New Horizons proposal was one of five that officially submitted to NASA. It was later selected as one of two finalists to be subject to a three-month concept study in June 2001. The other finalist, POSSE (Pluto and Outer Solar System Explorer), was a separate but similar Pluto mission concept by the University of Colorado Boulder, led by principal investigator Larry W. Esposito, and supported by the JPL, Lockheed Martin and the University of California.However, the APL, in addition to being supported by Pluto Kuiper Express developers at the Goddard Space Flight Center and Stanford University were at an advantage; they had recently developed NEAR Shoemaker for NASA, which had successfully entered orbit around 433 Eros earlier that year, and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare.In November 2001, New Horizons was officially selected for funding as part of the New Frontiers program. However, the new NASA Administrator appointed by the Bush administration, Sean O'Keefe, was not supportive of New Horizons and effectively canceled it by not including it in NASA's budget for 2003. NASA's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, Ed Weiler, prompted Stern to lobby for the funding of New Horizons in hopes of the mission appearing in the Planetary Science Decadal Survey, a prioritized \"wish list,\"compiled by the United States National Research Council, that reflects the opinions of the scientific community.After an intense campaign to gain support for New Horizons, the Planetary Science Decadal Survey of 2003\u20132013 was published in the summer of 2002. New Horizons topped the list of projects considered the highest priority among the scientific community in the medium-size category; ahead of missions to the Moon, and even Jupiter. Weiler stated that it was a result that \"[his] administration was not going to fight\". Funding for the mission was finally secured following the publication of the report. Stern's team was finally able to start building the spacecraft and its instruments, with a planned launch in January 2006 and arrival at Pluto in 2015. Alice Bowman became Mission Operations Manager (MOM)."

The cost of the mission, including spacecraft and instrument development, launch vehicle, mission operations, data analysis, and education/public outreach, is approximately $700 million over 15 years (2001\u20132016). The spacecraft was built primarily by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. The mission's principal investigator is Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute (formerly NASA Associate Administrator).\nAfter separation from the launch vehicle, overall control was taken by Mission Operations Center (MOC) at the Applied Physics Laboratory in Howard County, Maryland. The science instruments are operated at Clyde Tombaugh Science Operations Center (T-SOC) in Boulder, Colorado. Navigation is performed at various contractor facilities, whereas the navigational positional data and related celestial reference frames are provided by the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station through Headquarters NASA and JPL.\nKinetX is the lead on the New Horizons navigation team and is responsible for planning trajectory adjustments as the spacecraft speeds toward the outer Solar System. Coincidentally the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was where the photographic plates were taken for the discovery of Pluto's moon Charon. The Naval Observatory itself is not far from the Lowell Observatory where Pluto was discovered.\nNew Horizons was originally planned as a voyage to the only unexplored planet in the Solar System. When the spacecraft was launched, Pluto was still classified as a planet, later to be reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Some members of the New Horizons team, including Alan Stern, disagree with the IAU definition and still describe Pluto as the ninth planet. Pluto's satellites Nix and Hydra also have a connection with the spacecraft: the first letters of their names (N and H) are the initials of New Horizons. The moons' discoverers chose these names for this reason, plus Nix and Hydra's relationship to the mythological Pluto.In addition to the science equipment, there are several cultural artifacts traveling with the spacecraft. These include a collection of 434,738 names stored on a compact disc, a piece of Scaled Composites's SpaceShipOne, a \"Not Yet Explored\" USPS stamp, and a Flag of the United States, along with other mementos.About 30 grams (1 oz) of Clyde Tombaugh's ashes are aboard the spacecraft, to commemorate his discovery of Pluto in 1930. A Florida-state quarter coin, whose design commemorates human exploration, is included, officially as a trim weight. One of the science packages (a dust counter) is named after Venetia Burney, who, as a child, suggested the name \"Pluto\" after its discovery."

The free-space path loss at its distance of 4.5 light-hours (3 billion km or 20 AU or 1.9 billion mi) is approximately 303 dB at 7 GHz.

As of January 17, 2024, the spacecraft is 57.97 AU (8.672 billion km; 5.389 billion mi) from the Sun traveling at 13.71 km/s (49,400 km/h; 30,700 mph).However, it is not the fastest spacecraft to leave the Solar System. As of July 2023, this record is held by Voyager 1, traveling at 16.985 km/s (61,146 km/h; 37,994 mph) relative to the Sun. Voyager 1 attained greater hyperbolic excess velocity than New Horizons due to gravity assists by Jupiter and Saturn.  When New Horizons reaches the distance of 100 AU (15 billion km; 9.3 billion mi), it will be traveling at about 13 km/s (47,000 km/h; 29,000 mph), around 4 km/s (14,000 km/h; 8,900 mph) slower than Voyager 1 at that distance. The Parker Solar Probe can also be measured as the fastest object, because of its orbital speed relative to the Sun at perihelion: 95.3 km/s (343,000 km/h; 213,000 mph). Because it remains in solar orbit, its specific orbital energy relative to the Sun is lower than New Horizons and other artificial objects escaping the Solar System.\nNew Horizons' Star 48B third stage is also on a hyperbolic escape trajectory from the Solar System and reached Jupiter before the New Horizons spacecraft; it was expected to cross Pluto's orbit on October 15, 2015. Because it was not in controlled flight, it did not receive the correct gravity assist and passed within 200 million km (120 million mi) of Pluto. The Centaur second stage did not achieve solar escape velocity and remains in a heliocentric orbit."

        "content": "La Capital is a daily Spanish-language newspaper edited and published in Rosario, province of Santa Fe, Argentina. It was founded on November 15, 1867, and it is the oldest Argentine newspaper still in circulation, which has gained it the title of Decano de la Prensa Argentina (\"Dean of the Argentine Press\"). \nThe name was chosen by its founder, Ovidio Lagos, as a political statement on the part of those, including him, who were lobbying to move the capital of the federal government to Rosario. Rosario was in fact declared the capital three times by Congress, only to face presidential vetoes each time.\nAt the time of its foundation, La Capital was an afternoon newspaper. Newspapers were just forums of political debate with classified ads. Since the beginning, the heading of La Capital included a motto showing a commitment to public opinion: Las columnas de La Capital pertenecen al pueblo, \"La Capital's columns belong to the people\".\nOn 19 August 1868 the editorial building was at 104 Santa Fe St. After that, La Capital turned into a morning newspaper, and in 1870 it moved to Port St. (now Buenos Aires St.). In 1874 and again in 1887 new printing machinery was acquired. In 1889 the editorial moved to a new building at 763 Sarmiento St. and acquired a French Marinoni reaction printer.\nIn 1903 the newspaper changed the format of its pages, abandoning the large sheet sizes. By 1905 the daily edition had 16 pages, and in 1906 it offered a full-color 28-page illustrated supplement.\nFor 111 years, since its foundation, the newspaper employed the \"hot type\" method, that is, with Linotype typesetting machines where molten lead and antimony were used to cast each line of text. In 1978 La Capital shifted to \"cold type\", using the phototypesetting method.\nIn mid-1998 the new publishing plant at Santiago St. near Rivadavia Ave. received its latest innovation, a Goss Urbanite rotating press which weighs 165 tonnes and measures almost 36 m in length. The new plant also features a number of other technologies. Using this, La Capital started a new edition, with a different layout and format, and fully in color.\nBesides national and international news, the newspaper covers local news from Rosario and its metropolitan area (Greater Rosario), plus other towns in the region and four other provinces besides Santa Fe, reaching about 2 million readers."

It was recorded in five days in June 1982 and was released in January 1983 through Spiderleg Records. The album was later re-released via Bluurg, the band's own record label.\nThe album is influenced by the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. The most obvious sign of such an influence is the song \"Big Brother\"; Big Brother is the dictatorial political leader figure in Orwell's novel. The song revolves around how \"Big Brother is watching you\", and when Dick Lucas sings \"there's a TV in my front room and it's screwing up my head\", it is a comparison between the telescreen in the novel which monitored citizens constantly and excessive viewing of mass media. Today, there is a huge amount of video surveillance in the United Kingdom, showing the foresight of this subject matter. Like the novel, the album has dystopian overtones.\nIt also describes a world ravaged by war, most likely our world which arguably is, this is suggested by track titles such as \"Dying World\" and \"All Gone Dead\". The latter contains lyrics like \"So long to the world, that's what they said, it's 1984 and it's all gone dead\", which can be seen as another reference to Nineteen Eighty-Four.\nThe Day the Country Died is widely regarded as a classic punk rock album."

        "content": "Como ama una mujer (English: How a Woman Loves) is the fifth studio album and first Spanish album by American singer and actress Jennifer Lopez. It was released on March 23, 2007, by Epic Records. After including some Spanish songs on her first two albums, Lopez initially became interested in recording a full-length studio album in 2004 when she recorded a song with her then-husband Marc Anthony for his ninth studio album. After releasing her fourth studio album, Rebirth (2005), Lopez started working heavily on the album with Anthony, Est\u00e9fano and Julio Reyes Copello in a period of two and a half years. Composed entirely of ballads (and the exception of a few other genres), Como Ama una Mujer talks about love and heartbreak, being organic in its instrumentation and introspective in its lyrics.\nThe album was given a mixed reception from music critics, with many praising her vocals for being more improved than her previous records, but thought the album was too serious and questioned a lack of highlights within the album. Commercially, the album debuted inside the top ten of the US Billboard 200 and marked the highest first-week sales for an artist's debut Spanish album. Elsewhere, it topped the Switzerland charts and became a top-ten album in eight other countries.\nTwo singles were released from the album: \"Qu\u00e9 Hiciste\" and \"Me Haces Falta\". The first was released on January 26, 2007, and became a success in many countries, reaching number-one in Italy, Spain, Switzerland and on the US Hot Latin Songs, and a top-ten hit elsewhere, while the second single was released  on March 23, 2007, but was a commercial disappointment. Lopez promoted the album with a co-headlining tour with Anthony in 2007."

        "content": "Prior to breaking out into the music scene in May 1999 with her single \"If You Had My Love\", Lopez always pictured her music career to be in Spanish. Her first demo tape was called \"Vivir Sin Ti\" (\"To Live Without You\"), however former Sony Music president Tommy Mottola persuaded Lopez to do her first album in English. According to Lopez: \"My life took a different turn, which was great for me. But my heart was always kind of on the Spanish side.\" Later, throughout her career as a singer, she included two tracks in Spanish on her debut album, On the 6 (1999), with one being the single \"No Me Ames\" and five on her sophomore studio album, J.Lo (2001).Plans for Lopez to release a full-length Spanish-language album materialized in 2004, when Lopez's then-husband Marc Anthony was finishing up production of his ninth studio album Amar Sin Mentiras (2004) with Est\u00e9fano and Julio Reyes Copello. Lopez went into the recording studio with them to record a song entitled \"Escap\u00e9monos\", as a duet with Anthony. She enjoyed working on the song so much that she decided to record a full-length Spanish album; something she had wanted to do for years. In the same year, she recorded a Spanish version of the song \"Sway\", called \"Qui\u00e9n Ser\u00e1\", for her film Shall We Dance? (2004), but the English version recorded by Pussycat Dolls was used instead. Before recording began for her first Spanish album, Lopez recorded and released her fourth English studio album Rebirth (2005).In early 2006 it was announced that Lopez would release her first Spanish album and her fifth studio album Como Ama una Mujer later that year and that she worked mostly with Colombian record producer Est\u00e9fano, Reyes and Anthony. Amidst the recording process, she was also shooting a film with Anthony, El Cantante (2007) and providing vocals for its soundtrack entirely done by Anthony, as well as recording a more \"urban-leaning\" full-English album. According to Est\u00e9fano, Como Ama una Mujer was going to \"prove critics wrong\" from its \"big songs that require a voice\"; referring to the critics about Lopez having a \"limited\" vocal tone. After working on the album, Lopez said that she matured as singer, stating: \n\n\"I've matured as a singer. Marc gave me confidence in the studio as well. When someone believes in you so much, you don't want to let them down. And it's also the material. I think this material lent itself to my voice. And it actually made me approach my new English album in a different way. I have a different standard now\"."

Despite the fact that she speaks Spanish, Lopez didn't write any song on the album. However, she wanted to make sure she was expressing everything accurately. She said: \"You have to have a total command of the language, so I couldn\u2019t write it all myself, you know what I mean?. I had to really depend on people to express what I was feeling.\" Lopez also emphasized that she really expressed to the writers the kind of album she wanted to make and the things that were important for her. She explained: \"I would say, 'This songs needs to be about a person, and when he's leaving,' and they would turn around and write in Spanish.\" She also declared that, emotionally speaking, the album was closer to who she was than any album she had ever done.Como Ama una Mujer is a mainstream, traditional Latin pop album, composed mostly of romantic ballads, differing from her previous urban sounds as well as the rhythmic Latin pop vibe heard that year. It is also known for being \"organic in its instrumentation and introspective in its lyrics.\" The first song written for the album was \"Por Arriesgarnos\" and is a duet with Marc Anthony. Initially, the song wasn't intend to be a duet, with Lopez remarking that \"there was a background male voice, and Marc did the backups. I asked to put his voice up, because I think the harmony parts blended so beautifully.\" Meanwhile, when the album was almost done, the song \"Qu\u00e9 Hiciste\" was a last minute addition and was born after a dream Anthony had with late singer Roc\u00edo Jurado. Lopez explained: \"Marc woke up and said, \u2019I just had the craziest dream.' 'What was the dream?' And he said, 'Roc\u00edo Jurado was in this room and she was saying', 'Come here, get in this room right now, listen to this. This song is for Jennifer,' and she was singing a melody.'\" Then, since she had not studio equipment nearby to capture the essence of the song, she took her phone, called up their answering machine and told him to sing. Later, she called a Spanish writer she was working with to help her with adapting the lyrics."

It was recorded from July to October 2000 in New York City and featured re-recordings of songs Bowie recorded between 1964 and 1971, along with a couple of new tracks. The project was co-produced by Bowie and Mark Plati and featured musicians from Bowie's then-touring band\u2014Plati, Earl Slick, Gail Ann Dorsey, Mike Garson and Sterling Campbell\u2014with overdubs from Lisa Germano, Gerry Leonard and Cuong Vu.\nBowie's intention for the project was to rehearse the tracks, record them live and release them as quickly as possible, predating the idea of the surprise album. Intended for release in March 2001, the album was shelved by EMI/Virgin, leading Bowie to depart the label and begin work on his next album Heathen (2002). Various Toy tracks saw release as B-sides and bonus tracks in the ensuing years; two were remade for Heathen and two appeared on the Nothing Has Changed compilation in 2014.\nDifferent mixes of the Toy tracks leaked onto the Internet in 2011, which caught media attention. Ten years later, Warner Music Group announced in September 2021 that Toy would get an official release as part of the box set Brilliant Adventure (1992\u20132001) on 26 November, through Bowie's own ISO label and Parlophone. A separate deluxe edition, featuring previously unseen photographs, alternate mixes, proposed B-sides and 13 new remixes of the tracks, was released on 7 January 2022. The official release received positive reviews from music critics, with many highlighting Bowie's vocal performances. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number five on the UK Albums Chart, becoming Bowie's 35th UK top 10 album."

After ending his Mini Tour with a performance at the Glastonbury Festival in June 2000, he stated, \"I hate to waste the energy of a show-honed band so I've asked one and all if they would like to make an album immediately when we get back to New York.\" He then revealed his intention of re-recording these songs, explaining \"Not so much Pin Ups II as an Up Date I.\" Work on the \"Sixties album\" began a month later in July under the working title Toy, which came from a lyric in two songs recorded. The lineup consisted of the members of Bowie's touring band: guitarist Earl Slick, bassist Gail Ann Dorsey, pianist Mike Garson, musician Mark Plati and drummer Sterling Campbell.According to biographer David Buckley, the band rehearsed the songs at Sear Sound Studios in New York City before recording them as live tracks. Plati recalled: \"The idea was to keep it loose, fast, and not clean things up too much or dwell on perfection. As a result, we had 13 basic tracks cut in around nine days.\" Slick later told Rolling Stone: \"We had been doing a lot of gigs up to that point. We didn't have to do a whole lot of thinking about how to approach the songs. We had an operating system; an unspoken one. We hardly ever talked about anything. We'd just look at each other, or David would look at us, and it would just happen.\" He also stated that he refused to listen to Bowie's original recordings of the tracks, so to prevent the originals from influencing his playing on the new versions. Plati, whom Bowie chose to co-produce the project, was integral to the new album's sound. Pete Keppler engineered the sessions, while Bowie's former producer Tony Visconti provided string arrangements on two tracks. Recording took a two-month break in August due to the birth of Bowie and Iman's daughter Alexandria.Following the two-month break, multi-instrumentalist Lisa Germano was hired by Bowie, at Plati's suggestion, to contribute overdubs. After seeing her perform in New York for the rock band Eels in August, Plati stated \"I knew I needed to get her on the Bowie album.\" Germano was thrilled by the experience and both Bowie and Plati commended her contributions. Overdubs commenced at New York's Looking Glass Studios in October. Also hired were Gerry Leonard and Cuong Vu, who contributed guitar and trumpet, respectively. Also recorded during this time was a cover of the Who's \"Pictures of Lily\" for the tribute album Substitute: The Songs of the Who. Mixing began at the end of October, with Bowie predicting a release date of March 2001."

        "content": "Bowie initially wanted to release Toy as quickly as possible. In the early 2000s, the idea of a surprise album was several years ahead of its time. Plati later commented, \"Record labels just weren't set up to do that at the time\u2014too many moving parts and all the rest of it.\" Originally scheduled for release in March 2001, Toy was initially delayed to May. In June, Bowie revealed: \"EMI/Virgin seem to have a lot of scheduling conflicts this year, which has put an awful lot on the back burner. Toy is finished and ready to go, and I will make an announcement as soon as I get a very real date.\" After making Bowie's back catalogue available for digital download in 2000, the label, who were in the middle of various financial struggles, feared poor commercial performance for Toy and expressed a desire for an album of new material instead, indefinitely shelving the record. In October, Bowie responded \"Fine by me. I'm extremely happy with the new stuff ...[but] I won't let Toy slide away. I'm working on a way that you'll be able to get the songs next year as well as the newie.\" Buckley argues that had it been released, Toy would have \"easily\" reached the UK top 20, even if it was only bought by Bowie's hardcore fans.As the label were negotiating, Bowie began work with Visconti on Heathen. According to Visconti, Bowie was \"hurt terribly\" by Toy's rejection and as a result, left EMI/Virgin and signed an agreement with Columbia Records in early 2002 to issue Heathen via his own ISO label. Between 2002 and 2003, tracks from Toy, including \"Conversation Piece\", \"Shadow Man\", \"You've Got a Habit of Leaving\" and \"Baby Loves that Way\", appeared as various B-sides and bonus tracks. \"Afraid\" and \"Uncle Floyd\" were remade for Heathen, with the latter retitled \"Slip Away\". \"Let Me Sleep Beside You\" and \"Your Turn to Drive\" later saw official release on the three-disc edition of the 2014 compilation Nothing Has Changed. Bowie remarked in 2003:\nToy has actually started now to become a reservoir of B-sides and bonus tracks, so it's much depleted. From the original 14 or so that I did, I think seven are now out there. I think there's still enough in the past to be able to pop some more back and top it up, so to speak, but you know what? New writing just takes precedence. It always does."

        "content": "In March 2011, 14 tracks from the Toy sessions, excluding \"Karma Man\" and \"Can't Help Thinking About Me\", were leaked onto the Internet, attracting media attention. The leaked tracks are different mixes compared to the officially released B-sides and bonus tracks. According to biographer Nicholas Pegg, the edits suggest that they are not final master recordings, rather tracks at an earlier stage of mixing. When asked about the leak, Plati denied any involvement, stating, \"I think someone got a rough mix on CD somehow.\" Regarding the leak overall, Pegg comments that it is \"fascinating, thrilling and beautiful \u2013 and, as is so often the case with Bowie's work, an obvious creative stepping-stone between the previous album and the next.\"Ten years later, on 29 September 2021, Warner Music Group announced that Toy would get an official release on 26 November as part of the box set Brilliant Adventure (1992\u20132001) through ISO and Parlophone. \"You've Got a Habit of Leaving\" was released as a digital single the same day. \"Karma Man\" and an \"alternative ending mix\" of \"Silly Boy Blue\" were released as the next single on 15 October, while \"Can't Help Thinking About Me\" followed on 19 November. Plati, who assisted in the mixing of the Toy material for the box set, said in a statement:\nToy is like a moment in time captured in an amber of joy, fire and energy. It's the sound of people happy to be playing music. David revisited and re-examined his work from decades prior through prisms of experience and fresh perspective \u2013 a parallel not lost on me as I now revisit it twenty years later. From time to time, he used to say 'Mark, this is our album' \u2013 I think because he knew I was so deeply in the trenches with him on that journey. I'm happy to finally be able to say it now belongs to all of us.\nA separate deluxe edition, titled Toy:Box, was released on 7 January 2022, the day before what would have been Bowie's 75th birthday. The release includes previously unseen photographs, alternate mixes, proposed B-sides and 13 new \"Unplugged and Somewhat Slightly Electric\" remixes of the Toy tracks. These remixes contain new guitar parts by Plati and Earl Slick, replicating a style done by the Rolling Stones' Keith Richards. The \"Unplugged and Somewhat Slightly Electric\" mix of \"Shadow Man\" was released as a single on streaming services on 6 January. The release ends with \"Toy (Your Turn to Drive)\", a new track compiled from an extended jam during a take of \"I Dig Everything\". Featuring updated mixing, Plati stated: \"As it was culled from 'I Dig Everything', it makes sense to bookend the album with this track. It's also a fitting postscript to the Toy era.\" Visconti, who called it Bowie's \"ghost album\", was positive about its official release, telling Uncut magazine that he believed it contained some of Bowie's finest work. The album additionally saw standalone CD and LP releases on 5 August 2022, alongside the other studio albums from the Brilliant Adventure set."

        "content": "The Opies have argued for an identification of the original Bobby Shafto with a resident of Hollybrook, County Wicklow, Ireland, who died in 1737. However, the tune derives from the earlier \"Brave Willie Forster\", found in the Henry Atkinson manuscript from the 1690s, and the William Dixon manuscript, from the 1730s, both from north-east England; besides these early versions, there are two variation sets for Northumbrian smallpipes, by John Peacock, from the beginning of the 19th century, and by Tom Clough, from the early 20th century. The song is also associated with the region, having been used by the supporters of Robert Shafto (sometimes spelt Shaftoe), who was an eighteenth-century British Member of Parliament (MP) for County Durham (c. 1730\u201397), and later the borough of Downton in Wiltshire. Supporters used another verse in the 1761 election:\n\nBobby Shafto's looking out,\nAll his ribbons flew about,\nAll the ladies gave a shout,\nHey for Bobby Shafto!The song is said to relate the story of how he broke the heart of Bridget Belasyse of Brancepeth Castle, County Durham, where his brother Thomas was rector, when he married Anne Duncombe of Duncombe Park in Yorkshire. Bridget Belasyse is said to have died two weeks after hearing the news.Thomas & George Allan, in their illustrated edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings (1891), argued that the \"Bobby Shafto\" of the song was in fact his son, although his father fits the description of the lyrics better. In reality, it is likely that his grandson, Robert Duncombe Shafto, also used the song for electioneering in 1861, with several of the later verses being added around this time."

        "content": "The setting is the east shore of the Caspian Sea (modern Turkmenistan) where the Red Army soldier Fyodor Sukhov has been fighting the Civil War in Russian Asia for a number of years. The movie opens with a panoramic shot of a bucolic Russian countryside. Katerina Matveyevna, Sukhov's beloved wife, is standing in a field. Awakening from this daydream, Sukhov is walking through the Central Asian desert \u2013 a stark contrast to his homeland. He finds Sayid buried in the sand. Sayid, an austere Central Asian, comes to Sukhov's rescue in sticky situations throughout the movie. Sukhov frees Sayid, and they strike a friendly but reticent relationship. While traveling together they are caught up in a desert fight between a Red Army cavalry unit and Basmachi guerrillas. The cavalry unit commander, Rakhimov, leaves to Sukhov the harem of the Basmachi leader Abdullah, left behind by him, for temporary protection. He also leaves a young Red Army soldier, Petrukha, to assist Sukhov with the task, and proceeds to pursue the fleeing Abdullah.\nSukhov and women from Abdullah's harem return to a nearby shore village. There, Sukhov charges the local museum's curator with protecting the women, and prepares to head home. Sukhov hopes to \"modernize\" the wives of the harem, and make them part of the modern society. He urges them to take off their burqa and reject polygamy. The wives are loath to do this, though, and as Sukhov takes on the role of protector, the wives declare him their new husband.\nSoon, looking for a seaway across the border, Abdullah and his gang come to the same village and find Abdullah's wives. Sukhov is bound to stay. Hoping to obtain help and weapons, Sukhov and Petrukha visit Pavel Vereschagin, a former Tsar's customs official. Vereschagin warms to Petrukha who reminds him of his dead son, but after discussing the matter with his nagging wife, Vereschagin refuses. Sukhov finds a machine gun and a case of dynamite that he plants on Abdullah's ship. Meanwhile, Abdullah has confronted his wives, and is preparing to punish them for their \"dishonor\", as they did not kill themselves when Abdullah left them. Sukhov manages to capture and lock Abdullah as a hostage, but after he leaves, Abdullah convinces Gyulchatai, the youngest wife of the harem, to free him and then kills Gyulchatai and Petrukha.\nThe museum curator shows Sukhov an ancient underground passage that leads to the sea. Sukhov and the women of the harem attempt to escape through the passage, but on arriving at the seashore they are impelled to hide in a large empty oil tank. Abdullah discovers that and plans on setting the oil tank on fire.\nEnraged at the cold-hearted murder of Petrukha, Vereschagin decides to help Sukhov and takes Abdullah's ship. Sayid also helps Sukhov, and together they fend off Abdullah's gang. Vereschagin, unaware of the dynamite on the ship and not hearing Sukhov's shouted warnings, dies on the exploding ship.\nSukhov kills Abdullah and his gang, returns the harem to Rakhimov and bids farewell to Sayid. He then begins his journey home on foot, having refused a horse since a horse is merely \"a nuisance\"."

He shows much wisdom and skill in his actions and a gentle human side in his graphical dreams, in which he mentally writes letters to his beloved wife.Georgi Yumatov was chosen for the role, but was dismissed for a drunken brawl right before the shooting. Therefore, Motyl called for Kuznetsov, who was the second choice during the selection.Pavel Luspekayev as Pavel Vereschagin \u2013 a former tsarist customs official. Vereschagin lives a lonely life as the only Russian, along with his wife, in a remote village. The walls of his house are covered with pictures of the military campaigns where he was awarded and wounded. The Civil War has left him without an official job and a place to go. He is a big man and a straightforward person with a tendency for alcoholism due to the nostalgia for his past. He has an arsenal of weapons that brings both conflicting parties (Sukhov and Abdullah's men) to his house at some point in the film. Initially neutral, he eventually takes the side of Sukhov.This was Luspekayev's last role. A World War II veteran and an experienced stage actor, both of his feet were amputated in the 1960s due to past injuries. Given Luspekayev's condition, Motyl wrote a script for a man on crutches. Luspekayev refused, arguing that his character should appear not as a cripple, but as a strong person who died prematurely. While filming, he walked on prosthetic legs and had to take regular rests due to pain. He died in 1970.Spartak Mishulin as Sayid \u2013 a skilled man of few words. He seeks revenge on Dzhavdet, a Basmachi gang leader who killed his father, robbed his family and buried him in sand for a slow death; otherwise his motives and reactions are unclear and unexpected. For example, after Sukhov dug him out, Sayid, instead of thanking him, says, \"Why did you dig me out? There will be no rest while Dzhavdet is alive.\" Sayid suddenly appears every now and then to help Sukhov against bandits, but when asked why, simply replies that he has \"heard shooting,\" giving an impression that he just seeks Dzhavdet via any armed conflict nearby.In contrast with Luspekayev, this was one of the first movie roles for Mishulin, although he was previously active as a TV and stage actor.Kakhi Kavsadze as Abdullah \u2013 a cunning Basmachi leader with no respect for human life. Both he and Sayid originate from poor families, and their fathers were friends. However, contrary to Sayid, Abdullah took the path of banditry.Kavsadze, a Georgian by nationality, fit very well into the role of an Asian gang leader. However, he had never ridden a horse, while his character was supposed to be a keen horse rider. He never actually rides in the film, but only sits on a horse, or even on the shoulders of an assistant.Nikolai Godovikov as Petrukha \u2013 a young Red Army soldier. He attempts to court Gyulchatai, aiming to start a family.Coincidentally, Godovikov started dating Denisova (one of the actresses who played Gyulchatai) after filming.Raisa Kurkina as Nastasia, Vereschagin's wife \u2013 Vereschagin's life partner, a homemaker who balances his mental instability.\nGalina Luchai as Katerina Matveyevna, Sukhov's wife \u2013 she appears in the film only through Sukhov's dreams, to elaborate his character.Abdullah's wivesAlla Limenes \u2013 Zarina\nTatyana Krichevskaya, Galina Dashevskaya and Galina Umpeleva as Dzhamilya\nZinaida Rakhmatova as Gyuzel\nSvetlana Slivinskaya as Saida\nVelta Chebotarenok (Deglav) as Khafiza\nTatyana Tkach as Zukhra\nLidiya Smirnova as Leila\nZinaida Rachmatova as Zulfia\nTatiana Fedotova and Tatiana Denisova as Gyulchatai \u2013 the youngest and most curious wife of Abdullah. She is the only wife who interacts with outsiders, i.e., Sukhov and Petrukha.Most of Abdullah's wives were portrayed by non-professional actors. As they wore burqas most of the time, they were often replaced by other women, and even by male soldiers from the military unit stationed nearby. Motyl shot a few semi-nude scenes involving some of the wives for character development, but those scenes were cut by censors."

Sayid is found barehanded in the beginning; he acquires all his weapons through the film and uses them skillfully. Sukhov gives him a knife, which Sayid later throws to kill an attacker. He shoots a carbine taken from a bandit, whom he strangled using rope as a lasso (while helping Sukhov). His skills in riding are demonstrated when he jumps on a horse, back first, while walking backwards and keeping his enemy at gunpoint. He then slowly rides away, sitting backwards on the horse.\nVereschagin, despite having an arsenal of small arms, fights barehanded, which accentuates his brute force and straightforwardness. Both Sukhov and Abdullah use handguns rather than rifles, as appropriate to their leading, officer-like positions. Sukhov carries a Nagant M1895 revolver, a personal gift from brigade commander M. N. Kovun, whereas Abdullah uses a Mauser C96. To deal with Abdullah's gang, Sukhov fetches and fixes a machine gun. Petrukha has a rifle that jams and never fires when needed. Abdullah's gang members carry carbines and long knives characteristic of the time and region."

Initially several directors, including Andrei Tarkovsky and Andrei Konchalovsky, were offered the film but they turned it down, Motyl claims, for two main reasons. Firstly, Konchalovsky thought only American actors could pull off the part of a lead role in a western, and secondly the screenplay was considered weak. Motyl also initially turned down the offer, but then found himself in a no-choice situation, as he would not be given any other film to direct.After the first version of the film was turned down by Mosfilm, Valentin Yezhov and Rustam Ibragimbekov were assigned to improve the script. Ibragimbekov was chosen by his nationality as an expert on the East, though in reality he was raised in Russia and never been in the region. A war veteran told Yezhov a story of a harem abandoned by a Basmachi leader on the run, which became the pivot of the new script. Further rewriting came from Motyl after he replaced Konchalovsky as director. Motyl completely reshaped and put forward the character of Vereschagin \u2013 all his dialogues, as well as about 60% of the entire script, were rewritten and improvised during the filming. Motyl also came up with the idea of revealing Sukhov's personality through his dreams, in which he writes letters to his beloved wife. Those letters were composed by Mark Zakharov, a friend of Motyl's.Years later, Konchalovsky praised the final script as a masterpiece."

The sand dune scenes were shot in the Karakum Desert near Mary, Turkmenistan, with the museum scenes filmed in the nearby ancient city of Merv. The distinctive Kyz Kala (Gyz Gala) fortress, for example, figures prominently. The dune scenes were demanding for actors, who had to make large circles in the scorching heat to approach the shooting location without leaving telltale traces in the sand. However, the heaviest burden fell on Mishulin, who spent in total several days in a box buried in sand while preparing for several takes of the opening scene. The village buildings and Vereschagin's house were temporary mockups that had to be regularly repaired due to damage from frequent winds.Horse riding scenes were performed by the special stunt unit formed for the War and Peace film series. Although it did not perform any stunts in this film, one member of the unit died in an accident during filming. Some other accidents occurred due to poor overall discipline and security. For example, a cut is seen on Vereschagin's face when he fights on the ship. He received this cut in a drunken brawl the day before. Also, some props were stolen by local thieves one night. Security was improved after Motyl hired a local criminal leader for the role of a member of Abdullah's gang.The film involved two dangerous stunts, the first when Abdullah's officer, supposedly thrown out by Vereschagin, breaks through a second-floor window and falls to the sand below. The other is when Sukhov jumps from an oil tank set on fire. Both stunts were performed by Valentin Faber."

It was nominated for the 1970 USSR State Prize, but lost to By the Lake. The latter one was seen as \"ideologically correct\", while the first one was seen as pure entertainment, i.e., of low ideological value. In the opinion of film director Motyl the film was not allowed to film festivals abroad, because the Soviet ideologists were sure that it will receive awards there, which was ideologically inadmissible. Only in 1998 was it awarded the Russian State Prize by a special decree of President Boris Yeltsin, being recognized as culturally significant.The film received limited attention in the West. It was shown at a Soviet film festival at the Little Carnegie Theatre in 1973, meant to tie in with Leonid Brezhnev's visit to the United States. Roger Greenspun, the New York Times movie critic, classified it as an \"escapist entertainment\" (together with another Soviet film, a comedy Ivan Vassilyevich Changes His Profession) and describes it as a \"picaresque adventure\"."

The founders focused on readers' needs, which became Le Point's ideal, published by Le Point Communication on Thursdays.After a fairly difficult start in September 1972, the magazine quickly challenged L'Express. The editorial team of spring 1972 found financial backing with Hachette and was then directed by Claude Imbert. Other journalists making up the team were: Jacques Duquesne, Henri Trinchet, Pierre Billard, Robert Franc, and Georges Suffert. The management included Olivier Chevrillon and Philippe Ramond. It has changed ownership several times. Gaumont Film Company bought the magazine in 1981. In 1993, Generale Occidentale purchased 82.5% of publisher Sebdo, the owner of magazine Le Point from Gaumont.In 1997 the magazine was acquired by its current owner Art\u00e9mis, a French investment group founded and owned by the billionaire businessman Fran\u00e7ois Pinault. In 2001, the logo and layout of Le Point was changed. The weekly recruited journalists from the Parisian press and relied on its ability to redefine the genre. It modeled itself closely on Time Magazine and Newsweek.\nFranz-Olivier Giesbert was chief executive officer of Le Point from 2000 until 18 January 2014, when Etienne Gernelle replaced him. Giesbert, however, remained an adviser to the magazine and continued to write editorials and articles.

Producing the album, Jamie Smith of the xx created electronic beats for the songs on his laptop and mixed them in a detailed process with the audio engineer Rodaidh McDonald, who attempted to reproduce the intimate, unembellished quality of the band's original demos.\nAlong with the xx's early R&B influences, the album has drawn comparisons from journalists to alternative rock, electronica and post-punk sounds. Its largely melancholic songs feature minimalist arrangements built around Smith's beats and instrumental parts recorded by the other members of the band, including Oliver Sim's basslines and sparse guitar figures by Baria Qureshi and Romy Madley Croft, who employs reverb in her lead guitar playing. Most of the songs are sung as low-key duets by Croft and Sim, both of whom had written emotional lyrics about love, intimacy, loss and desire.\nReleased to widespread acclaim, xx was named one of 2009's best records and received praise for the band's atmospheric style of indie rock and pop as well as the interpersonal dimension of the performances. Commercially, it performed steadily over its first few years of release, becoming a sleeper hit in the United Kingdom and the United States, and eventually sold one million copies. Although major media outlets had largely ignored the band at first, and none of its singles became hits, xx received greater exposure from the licensing of its songs to television programmes and the band's Mercury Prize win for the album in 2010.\nShortly after the album's release, and with differences between Qureshi and the rest of the group leading to her dismissal, the xx continued to play as a trio on a protracted concert tour that helped increase their fanbase, reputation in the press and confidence as performers. xx proved highly influential in subsequent years, as its distinctive stylistic elements were incorporated by many indie bands and top-selling pop acts. One of the most acclaimed records of its era, it has appeared on top album lists published by NME, Rolling Stone and The Guardian."

        "content": "While students at South London's Elliott School in 2005, childhood friends Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim formed the xx with Jamie Smith and Baria Qureshi. Croft and Sim played guitar and bass, respectively, and dueted as the band's vocalists, while Smith programmed electronic beats for their songs and Qureshi doubled as a keyboardist and additional guitarist. During late nights, Croft and Sim either shared lyrics with each other through instant messaging or rehearsed quietly with Smith and Qureshi in their bedrooms so they would not disturb the rest of the household. The xx were greatly influenced by American R&B producers such as The Neptunes and Timbaland, whose minimalist productions incorporated vocal harmonies, clapping percussion, unconventional samples and pronounced beats. The band covered Aaliyah's \"Hot Like Fire\" (1997), Womack & Womack's \"Teardrops\" (1988) and other past R&B hits when they performed live and recorded their demos.After posting the demos on their Myspace page, the xx drew the interest of Young Turks, an imprint label of XL Recordings. They submitted the demos to XL's head office at Ladbroke Grove and were subsequently signed to a recording contract. The group worked with producers such as Diplo and Kwes, to no success before they were introduced to the audio engineer Rodaidh McDonald by the xx's manager Caius Pawson, who gave him three CDs of demos titled \"Early Demos\", \"Recorded in Rehearsal Space\" and \"What Producers Did Wrong\". McDonald was impressed by the intimate quality and use of silence on the demos, which both he and the band felt may have challenged other producers who wanted to incorporate their individual tastes: \"They'd worked with about four other producers before then that had \u2013 and no discredit to them \u2013 I guess they'd seen a lot of space to add a kind of stamp on. There was a lot of empty space in the xx's music, even then, in the 'Early Demos'. But we just found that the best stuff was the most sparse.\""

        "content": "At the behest of XL's owner Richard Russell, the xx recorded their debut album at the label's small, in-house recording studio \u2013 XL Studio \u2013 making them the first act to record there. It was once the head office building's rear garage before Russell transformed it at the beginning of 2008 into a makeshift writing, rehearsal and demo space for XL's artists. McDonald was assigned in September to manage and properly equip the room, which he liked because it was soundproof and \"isolated from the rest of the office, so it wasn't like you were working in the record company's presence.\" Croft, on the other hand, called it a \"pretty confined space\" the size of a bathroom. Over the next few months, McDonald and Pawson prepared a budget for the label to fund the studio's preliminary setup, which would have recording equipment specifically suited for the xx, including a modestly sized soundboard ideal for recording a small group.The xx started to record the album in December 2008 with McDonald, who engineered the sessions. They would usually record at night after XL's staff had left, which Croft said made it feel \"isolated and quite creepy\". To reproduce the sound he had heard on the band's demos, McDonald had them write down their instruments' settings and test different areas of the studio to determine where he should record each member. Sim, who played a Precision Bass manufactured in the 1970s, was often recorded in the hallway outside the studio with a Fender Bassman, one of several amplifiers McDonald experimented with for xx. Some of Qureshi and Croft's guitars were also done in the hallway. Qureshi played a Gibson SG with a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe or Blues Deluxe amplifier, while Croft played an Epiphone Les Paul on most of the album and a Gibson ES-335 on a few songs. For her lead guitar parts, Croft used a delay pedal and a Roland Micro Cube amplifier with a reverb setting, which McDonald felt would best replicate her \"icy\", echo-filled sound on the demos.\nAfter all the instrumental elements had been tracked, Croft and Sim recorded their vocals together, rarely singing backup to one another on any of the songs. McDonald believed it was important for the singers to be \"in sync\" and share the same mental state or mood when performing full takes of songs, some of which he said benefited from when they were both \"quite tired and emotional\". He had Croft and Sim sing into Neumann microphones on most of the songs in order to make their vocals sound as \"intimate\" and conversational as possible. The microphones were among the more expensive items he borrowed for the studio's preliminary setup so XL would not be overwhelmed with a costly budget.Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx had been encouraged to self-produce their album by Russell; he believed it would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the DIY ethic practised at XL since its beginnings as a rave label. Smith was chosen by the rest of the group to produce xx. He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late nights in a nearby conference room while they recorded in the studio with drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC sampler, which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units. He also created click tracks for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.\nMost of xx was recorded from late December 2008 to late January 2009 before McDonald and Smith began an exhaustive mixing process, which lasted two weeks. For each song, they mixed one or two tracks of each instrument and used Waves Audio components to equalise the recordings. Having enjoyed how the demos captured unintended background noises such as street sounds, McDonald deliberately left certain sounds that would have otherwise been unwanted in the final mix. \"I wanted it to sound like people in a room, rather than this polished kind of perfect crystalline thing\", he explained. \"It was all the small details that we really liked.\"In February 2009, the group wrote and recorded \"Fantasy\", \"Shelter\" and \"Infinity\" before finishing xx, possibly by month's end according to McDonald; the album's liner notes credited the final date of recording as April. Sim sang his vocals for \"Infinity\" on the side of the studio opposite from Croft after his microphone had been unintentionally moved there, which resulted in a distant-sounding vocal exchange on the song. While recording \"Shelter\", a mechanical part from the guitar amplifier loosened and caused it to make a clattering sound, which McDonald and the xx chose to retain. \"It was just like this missing piece of percussion that the track needed!\", McDonald recalled."

        "content": "The songs on xx are composed around a framework of basslines and beats, while incorporating simple guitar riffs for melody, rhythm and texture; their melodic notes are separated by rests. Croft said the band's style of instrumentation became defined by the limited equipment they originally used: \"My guitar sound pretty much came from discovering there was reverb on my little practice amp and really loving the mood it created.\" The loudest song, \"Intro\", is a largely instrumental recording with double-tracked beats, distorted keyboard, non-lexical vocables and a guitar riff. Songs such as \"Crystalised\" and \"VCR\" begin with a melodic ostinato and some understated sounds, including a xylophone on the latter, before leading to quietly sung verses. Croft and Sim exchange verses on \"Crystalised\" while backed by the sound of drum stick clicks and basslines before the beat is heard. On the austerely arranged \"Night Time\", Croft sings its first two minutes over only guitar and bass before its beat develops. \"Fantasy\" is highlighted by a shoegazing guitar sound.While McDonald observes a predominant R&B element, Russell feels the xx's music evokes the early hip hop records he listened to when he was young, as they are often limited to vocals, samples and beats. Music journalists, however, infer from xx that their influences are alternative rock acts such as Portishead, Young Marble Giants and Cocteau Twins, the last of which Croft said she had never heard before the album was released. The Scotsman describes xx as a minimalist, melancholic indie pop record that draws on elements from electronica and R&B, as well as The Cure and other alternative groups. According to Sarah Boden of The Observer, the album's unadorned, dream pop love songs are reminiscent of Cocteau Twins and Mazzy Star, because they feature low tempos, moody melodies and rhythms influenced by R&B and dubstep. Their arrangements have what Neil McCormick calls \"a very British, industrial aspect\", somewhat similar to the dub-inflected post-punk sound of the English producer Martin Hannett and his work with the band Joy Division. Both Croft and Sim said their combination of seemingly disparate influences could be attributed to the variety in each band member's music collection."

        "content": "\"Crystalised\" was released as the xx's debut single on 27 April 2009 and helped build interest in the band among listeners and journalists. It was part of a series of singles from xx, which included \"Basic Space\" on 3 August, \"Islands\" on 26 October and \"VCR\" on 25 January 2010. The band's music was largely ignored by BBC Radio 1 in the United Kingdom, and other major media outlets also believed they did not warrant strong attention; one editor from NME said at the time that the band was not ideal for their magazine's front cover. In the United States, the group benefited from the word-of-mouth marketing of blogs, beginning when they performed six consecutive sold-out shows at New York City clubs such as Pianos and the Mercury Lounge months prior to the album's release.Several of the songs from xx were licensed by XL to television programmes in the UK and North America. \"Intro\" became widely used as theme music in television, including sports highlights, episodes of series such as Law & Order and Cold Case, an advertisement for AT&T and BBC's coverage of the 2010 British general election. Along with their placement in television, songs from the record were used by North American chain stores such as Starbucks and Urban Outfitters as background music at their locations. According to McCormick in 2010, these marketing strategies helped the xx develop enough media presence to garner \"over half a million sales around the world without ever having anything as vulgar as a hit\". Kris Chen, XL's A&R senior vice-president, believed the exposure was desired and necessary for promoting an album that was not \"driven by pop radio\". Although the band realised their music had to be marketed somehow, Croft expressed reservations about \"putting our music on everything, just to put it to anything just for the sake of money\"."

        "content": "xx was released by Young Turks in August 2009 to widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 87, based on 25 reviews. According to Alexis Petridis, it was the most acclaimed album of the year.Critics particularly praised the xx's sound on the album; Simon Price wrote in The Independent that they were being universally lauded for their \"atmospheric indie rock, and rightly so\". The Daily Telegraph's Jack Arnhold regarded xx as \"one of this year's most beautiful and original debut albums\". Reviewing for The New Yorker, Sasha Frere-Jones remarked that the album rewards repeated listens because of the band's disciplined playing, while Mark Edwards of The Sunday Times said it succeeds with simple but \"very near perfect\" pop songs. AllMusic's Heather Phares called the instrumentation impeccable and was impressed by how poised and refined such a young group sounds. In The Irish Times, Jim Carroll said the exceptional chemistry behind Croft and Sim's melancholic duets is the highlight of \"this drop-dead gorgeous dream-pop symphony\". Matthew Cole from Slant Magazine believed their rapport gives an emotional weight to the music, which he said sounds timeless and capable of appealing to both indie and popular tastes. Christgau, writing in MSN Music, was somewhat more impressed by the music than by the lyrics, although he said the underlying force behind the singers' charmingly minimalist songs is a \"spiritual dimension\" offered by their ability to \"shift roles without ever seeming hostile, cold or even unsupportive\".Some reviewers had reservations. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times felt the singers are too disengaged and reticent to reveal any genuine emotion. \"Though they're singing to each other, it rarely feels intimate\", he wrote, \"more like two shy teenagers, eyes cast downward, awkwardly talking to the ground\". In the opinion of PopMatters' critic Ben Schumer, the consistent structures and tempos of the songs makes them sound somewhat monotonous on what is an otherwise affecting nocturnal mood piece. Conversely, Joshua Errett from Now found the music and singing mesmerising but lamented the lyrics, which he deemed emotionally immature and \"overwrought\".At the end of 2009, xx appeared on several critics' lists of the year's best albums, including rankings of ninth by Rolling Stone, sixth by Uncut, third by Pitchfork, second by NME and fourth by the Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot. The Guardian named it the year's best record in their annual critics poll and Tim Jonze, the newspaper's editor, hailed it as not only \"the sound of 2009, [but also] a distinctive musical statement of the like we may never get to hear again\". It also finished seventh in The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop poll of American critics and third in HMV's Poll of Polls, an annual list compiled by the British music retailer HMV and collated from best-album nominations made by journalists in the English and Irish music press. In decade-end lists of the greatest records from the 2000s, The Sunday Times and its sister paper, The Times, ranked xx seventy-seventh and thirtieth, respectively. The record was also included in the 2010 edition of Robert Dimery's music reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die."

        "content": "xx was not an immediate chart success, but eventually became a sleeper hit. It debuted at number 36 on the UK's Official Albums Chart and sold 4,180 copies in the first week after it was released, while in the United States it did not chart higher than number 92 on the Billboard 200. The album sold steadily for the next 44 weeks until July 2010, when it experienced a sharp increase in sales and a jump from number 44 to 16 on the British chart following its announcement as a nominee for the Mercury Prize, an annual award given to the best album from the UK and Ireland. By then, it had sold more than 150,000 copies in the UK and 179,000 copies in the US. Before the nominations shortlist had been announced, bookmakers and critics considered the xx as favourites to win the award over the more high-profile artists Corinne Bailey Rae, Paul Weller and Dizzee Rascal. The album remained in the top 20 of the UK chart in the weeks leading up to the Mercury Prize ceremony in September. Immediately after its win that week, it climbed from number 16 to 3 on its highest weekly sales \u2013 28,666 copies \u2013 and reached a total of 212,835 copies sold. McCormick, one of the critics who predicted its victory, explained that it \"seemed the record that most represented Britain\" with its charmingly intimate style and unique take on modern pop tastes, while citing its win as \"a rare example of the Mercury Prize doing music lovers a service\".By December 2010, xx had sold 325,000 copies in the UK and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. In the US, the album reached 350,000 copies sold by June 2012 with consistent weekly sales during its first two years of release, which Time magazine's Melissa Locker said was \"quite a feat\" in an era of music piracy, media streaming and YouTube. Adding to its commercial success, songs from the album were covered by a variety of major recording artists, including Shakira, Gorillaz and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.\n\nAlthough xx had been highly anticipated by XL, the album's success exceeded expectations in the press. McDonald said their direction and sound would have been entirely different had expectations been higher, while Croft was \"baffled\" by the acclaim given to what she viewed as an album they had made \"for themselves\". Sim had mixed feelings about its success, believing it could affect his songwriting in the future: \"This album was done with no expectations. No one knew who we were. When I was writing the songs, I didn't think anyone other than Romy or James would ever actually hear them. Now I know so many people will. I might feel I have to be a bit more private.\"At the Mercury Prize ceremony, Sim said the time since the album's release had \"felt like a haze\", but that the event served as \"a moment of clarity\". In their acceptance speech, the xx announced they would use the \u00a320,000 prize money to build their own studio, where they subsequently wrote and recorded their second album Coexist. When Coexist debuted in September 2012, xx was still on the British chart at number 37 and had sold 446,734 copies in the UK. The following year, it was ranked number 237 on NME's list of the top 500 albums of all time and named the 74th greatest debut record by Rolling Stone, who found its music radical as \"an exercise in restraint, in the artful use of space and silence\" during popular music's period of maximalism.In subsequent years, xx proved highly influential as many indie bands and mainstream pop acts incorporated the record's distinctive musical characteristics into their own songs. Petridis later wrote that to his surprise much of 2016's best-selling singles \"sounded oddly but irrefutably\" like the album: \"You can hear its muted, echoing guitars on everything from the Chainsmokers' 'Don't Let Me Down' to Shawn Mendes' 'Stitches' to Zara Larsson's 'Lush Life'.\" Ryan Tedder, who wrote hit songs for such top-selling singers as Beyonc\u00e9, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande, said the xx's \"hauntingness\" on the record \"gets referenced in at least every other [writing] session\".By January 2017, xx had reached 562,400 copies sold in the UK, and in September 2019, its sales there were reported at 612,000. That same month, it placed 26th on The Guardian's poll of 45 music writers ranking the 100 best albums from the 21st century. In an essay accompanying the list, the newspaper's music editor Ben Beaumont-Thomas said the album features \"the most compelling duets of the period: rather than singing to each other, it was as if two people were going through the same thing without the other knowing it \u2013 the perfect mood music for the disconnected interconnection of dating apps and social media.\""

        "content": "After xx was released, the xx toured Europe and North America through the end of 2009. Their first show in August was at Hoxton Hall in London, which Sim recalled was attended by only 112 people. When Pitchfork's positive review of the album elicited greater interest among American listeners, the xx were booked as the supporting act for the Friendly Fires's tour of larger club venues in the US. The difficulties of touring early on exacerbated the growing tensions between Qureshi and the rest of the group, which culminated in her dismissal after a difficult stay at an October music festival in New York. It was reported that she had become fatigued and left the group after they cancelled several concerts. Sim disputed those reports and said her departure had been the band's decision: \"We've grown up to be very different people. It wasn't working any more musically or as a friendship.\" Croft told NME in November, \"I guess 'personal differences' would be the standard way to say it. I guess it's just the intensity of being on tour, things are so much heightened.\"Rather than find a replacement for Qureshi, the xx continued to tour as a smaller line-up of guitar, bass and percussion. They also reduced their already minimalist arrangements for songs in concert, although Sim jokingly said Smith \"needs another few arms so he can work everything\" after Qureshi's departure. In their shows, Croft abandoned playing solos and chords in favour of less defined figures and motifs, while Smith performed beats and ambient sounds from his synth pad as an accompaniment to Croft and Sim's playing. Because their style had been suited to the small venues they first played, the xx focused more on the production value of their concerts and performing for larger audiences while on tour. They dressed in dark clothing and illuminated the stage with light boxes displaying their x-shaped, white-on-black logo.\nWith a growing fanbase, the xx made commitments to more concerts and extended their tour for the album. They toured intermittently for 18 months, including most of 2010. That year, they embarked on their first US tour and played high-profile festivals such as South by Southwest, Coachella and Bonnaroo. They were also a supporting act for fellow English group Florence and the Machine. Recalling the xx's show at Coachella, where they performed for 30,000 people, Croft said: \"That was the moment when I was, like, Oh, my God, I think people might be into this.\"By touring frequently, the xx broadened their reputation among listeners and the press. In March 2010, they played two consecutive nights at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London to capacity crowds and appeared on the cover of NME, who proclaimed them \"the most underrated band in Britain\". In April and May, they toured the southern US and Japan, which Croft said was most demanding part of the tour because \"none of us had been away from home continuously for so long.\" They were accompanied during this six-week period by the photographer Jamie-James Medina, who later published his photos of the group in his book The Tourist (2010).While on tour, the xx acclimated themselves to the increased attention and became considerably more sociable and confident. As Sim recounted, \"If you'd have put me onstage at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire a few years ago, I'd have run away. I couldn't have done it. We used to be terrified.\" In June 2010, the band played the Glastonbury Festival in Somerset and, according to the journalist Jude Rogers, displayed a newfound confidence through the rest of their summer and \"post-Mercury [Prize] autumn\" concerts: \"Croft would sing more boldly, Sim developed an onstage swagger and Smith began experimenting with different rhythms and textures.\""

Bryan Blackburn later wrote English-language lyrics for it. First performed in French by Greek singer Vicky Leandros (appearing as Vicky) as the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1967, it has since been recorded by many other musicians, most notably French orchestra leader Paul Mauriat, whose familiar instrumental version (recorded in late 1967) became the first number-one hit by a French lead artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 in America.\nThe song describes the pleasure and pain of love in terms of colours (blue and grey) and elements (water and wind). The English lyrics (\"Blue, blue, my world is blue \u2026\") focus on colours only (blue, grey, red, green, and black), using them to describe components of lost love. The English version by Vicky Leandros also appeared as \"Colours of Love\" in some locations including the UK."

At the close of voting, the song had received 17 points, placing it fourth in a field of 17, behind \"Il doit faire beau l\u00e0-bas\" (France), \"If I Could Choose\" (Ireland) and the winning song, \"Puppet on a String\" (United Kingdom).Despite not winning the Eurovision, Leandros recorded the song in many different languages for release in 19 countries. The song was a modest hit in Europe, and had some success in Japan and Canada (No. 40). The versions she recorded aside from French included English (as \"Love Is Blue\"), German (\"Blau wie das Meer\"), Italian (\"L'amore \u00e8 blu\") and Dutch (\"Liefde is zacht\").\nThe song achieved greater success through cover versions of the song by other artists. Some forty years after its original release, \"L'amour est bleu\", along with Domenico Modugno's \"Nel blu dipinto di blu\" (better known as \"Volare\") and Mocedades' \"Eres t\u00fa\", still counts as one of very few non-winning Eurovision entries ever to become a worldwide hit. The song has since become a favourite of Contest fans, most notably appearing as part of a medley introducing the semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 in Athens, one of only three non-winning songs to be involved (the others being \"Dschinghis Khan\" and \"Nel blu dipinto di blu\").\nIt was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1968 contest by Chris Baldo & Sophie Garel with \"Nous vivrons d'amour\". Vicky Leandros went on to win the Contest five years later with the song \"Apr\u00e8s toi\", again representing Luxembourg."

A DJ in Minneapolis played the recording and asked the audience to respond, and was inundated with phone calls about the song, and interest in the song then quickly spread around the country.The song became a number-one hit in the USA for five weeks in February and March 1968, the first recording by a French artist to top the Billboard Hot 100. (It remained the only French song to top the chart until 2017, when Daft Punk was a featured artist on Canadian artist The Weeknd's number-one hit \"Starboy\".)  Mauriat's version became a gold record, and its five-week run at the top is the second longest of any instrumental of the Hot 100 era, after \"Theme from A Summer Place\". The song also spent 11 weeks atop Billboard's Easy Listening survey, and held the longest-lasting title honours on this chart for 25 years. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 2 song for 1968. It is the best-known version of the song in the United States.  The Mauriat recording also reached No. 2 in Canada (No. 12 Year End), and No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart. The Mauriat album containing \"Love Is Blue\", Blooming Hits, also reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top LP's and Tapes chart for five weeks. The song sold fewer than 30,000 units in France, but 2 million singles and 800,000 LPs were sold in the US.Mauriat's version was featured repeatedly in an episode of Chris Carter's television series Millennium titled \"A Room with No View\", which originally aired on 24 April 1998 on the Fox Network. During the episode, the omnipresent melody is used by a kidnapper to brainwash a group of youths. His version is also briefly heard in The Simpsons episodes \"There's No Disgrace Like Home\" and \"The Blue and the Gray.\" It was played over the closing credits of Mad Men's sixth-season episode \"The Flood\", set in April 1968. The harpsichord riff from Mauriat's version was also sampled by the English electronica duo J Walk in their song \"French Letter\", as part of their 2002 album A Night on the Rocks."

Even though Juexin is in love with Mei, his cousin, he marries Li Ruijue on the orders of Master Gao after he graduates from middle school. After Juemin escapes from the Gao household, Master Gao asks Juexin to find Juemin. Juexin asks Juehui to help him, but the youngest brother accuses Juexin of being a coward. After learning about Mei's death, Juexin is saddened. Han said that \"[t]he miserable experience\" awakens Juexin, who begins opposing Master Gao.\nMei Han, author of the entry on \"Family\" in The Facts on File Companion to the World Novel: 1900 to the Present, said that Juexin \"is a victim of conservatism\" who is asked to stop observing idealism, loses the women who are dear to him, and \"does nothing but cries in the corner.\" Jin Feng, author of The New Woman in Early Twentieth-Century Chinese Fiction, said that Juexin is \"a character used by a foil to impress upon the reader Juehui's revolutionary courage as compared to people of his own generation and gender.\" Feng added that while Juehui believes that Juexin is a '\"coward who makes \"unnecessary sacrifices\" of himself and the women he loves', Juehui \"cannot help but sympathize with Juexin's dilemma, and in fact often depends on him as a buffer against abuses by their grandfather and uncles.\" Han says that Juexin is also an \"accomplice\" since he helps Master Gao try to find Juemin, and that Juexin \"insists on nonresistance\" despite the fact that he agrees with his brothers. Han argued that Juexin's obedience to the family angers Juehui despite the mercy that Juehui feels for Juexin, \"reflecting the author's own attitude toward\" Juexin.\nGao Juemin (\u9ad8\u89ba\u6c11; \u9ad8\u89c9\u6c11; G\u0101o Ju\u00e9m\u00edn; Kao1 Ch\u00fceh2-min2) - The middle brother.\nJuemin wears glasses. Juemin is in love with Qin, his cousin. Juemin anticipates the time when his academy begins admitting female students so that the two can get together and marry. Master Gao asks Juemin to marry the Grandniece of Milord Feng, but Juemin instead leaves the house, with Juehui helping him escape. Master Gao later ends the engagement and gives permission for Juemin and Qin to marry.\nGao Juehui (\u9ad8\u89ba\u6167; \u9ad8\u89c9\u6167; G\u0101o Ju\u00e9hu\u00ec; Kao1 Ch\u00fceh2-hui4) - The most rebellious of the brothers.\nJuehui has an interest in the ideals of the May Fourth Movement. Juehui has a romantic interest in Ming Feng. Han says that Juehui \"pays more attention to the rebellion\" than to Ming Feng. After Ming Feng's death he feels remorse. At the end of the novel, he believes staying in the family is too suffocating, so he leaves Chengdu to go to Shanghai.\nAccording to Feng, Juehui is \"the center of consciousness\" in Family. Feng said that while Juehui \"is apparently the most fearless and rebellious of the three brothers\" he also \"is by no means the heroic role model that he has read about in new books and journals\u2014the sources of all his new ideas.\" Feng argues that \"Juehui betrays the most pronounced contradictions through his interactions with his family\" and that Juehui \"often finds himself helplessly entangled in ambivalent feelings\" while dealing with his family, using his interactions with Juexin as an example. Han argued that while being \"high-spirited youth rebelling against his family's restrictions\", Juehui \"still possesses ideas\" from the Gao Family traditions. As an example she cites his pattern of affection for Ming Feng. Han argues that despite the fact that he likes her, \"he never expresses his love or his hidden dreams: If only Ming Feng were a lady like Qin, he would marry her in a heartbeat.\"\nLi Ruijue (\u674e\u745e\u73a8; \u674e\u745e\u73cf; L\u01d0 Ru\u00ecju\u00e9; Li3 Jui4-ch\u00fceh2) - Juexin's wife. She marries him and falls in love with him, but realizes that Juexin still loves Mei more than her. She dies in childbirth.\nHan said that Ruijue \"is beautiful and mild, and their intensive love produces their first boy, Hai Chen.\" After Master Gao dies, as Ruijue is pregnant with a second child, relatives cajole Juexin into moving Ruijue out of the city to avoid giving the coffin of Master Gao. Despite Juehui's pleas to have it reversed, Juexin allows the move to happen, and Ruijue dies of childbirth as Juexin is prevented from entering the delivery room during the period of mourning for Master Gao.\nMei (Chinese: \u6885; pinyin: M\u00e9i; Wade\u2013Giles: Mei2) - Juexin's cousin and the love of his life. She falls ill and dies.\nHan said that Mei \"lives a miserable life.\" Within a year from the start of the novel she marries and becomes a widow. Because her mother-in-law had not treated her well, she lives with her mother. Han said that the Gao family's younger members, especially Juexin, \"are sympathetic\" to Mei.\nMing Feng (\u9cf4\u9cf3; \u9e23\u51e4; M\u00edngf\u00e8ng; Ming2-feng4) - A maidservant who is forced to marry an older man. She commits suicide.\nHan describes Ming Feng as \"another tragic woman\" in the Gao family. Ming Feng wants to marry Juehui but Master Gao arranges to have her be a mistress to Milord Feng, a man who is at the same age level as Ming Feng's grandfather would be. Ming Feng begs other members to remove her from the situation but nobody can challenge Master Gao. At midnight before she is to be given to Feng, she appears in Juehui's bedroom but he is so busy working on academic articles that he does not notice Ming Feng and her pleas. She commits suicide by drowning herself in a pool of water. Han says \"Jue Min [sic] and others pity the girl, while Jue Hui [sic] now regrets his carelessness. However none of the people could have changed Ming Feng's fate.\"\nQin (\u7434; Q\u00edn; Ch'in2): A female cousin of Gao Juexin, and a student.\nFeng said that Qin \"is ensconced, somewhat ironically, in extensive and complex familial relationships\" so that the book rarely mentions her life away from the Gao family. Feng explained that because Ba Jin made the female student Qin as a more \"feminine\" and \"inferior\" counterpart to the male student Juehui, the \"domestication\" of Qin is \"necessary\". Feng argued that \"at first glance\" Qin and Juehui \"seem to me more similar than different\", and their parallel and symmetrical placement within the storyline of Family \"serves both to segregate the domains of their activities by gender and to differentiate the degree of their radicalism.\" For instance Feng notes that Qin does not come into conflict with male characters in her immediate or extended family and \"acts as a dutiful and loving daughter to her widowed mother\" while Juehui \"usually displays an antagonistic attitude\" towards older men in the Gao family and Juehui leaves the Gao family home. Feng concluded that the fact that Juehui leaves his house means that \"his conflicts with the traditional family system are more fundamental and irreconcilable than those in Qin's case.\" Feng argued that the author \"deployed Qin to magnify Juehui's revolutionary zeal\" by emphasizing differences that the two characters have in their emotional responses and respective relationships to the members of the Gao family and also \"located the source of Qin's weakness in her gender and thus reaffirmed Juehui's superiority.\"\nMaster Gao - The head of the Gao family.As Master Gao grows older, he attempts to reunite the Gao family.\nHan argues that Master Gao is \"complex\". She explained that Master Gao in fact loves his family and takes steps to enlarge it to accomplish his goal of having a large family, and that he does not believe that his decisions, which are based on ancestral rules, would harm his children. Han concluded that \"Withdrawing his order on his deathbed shows that he remained a kind grandfather at the end, even if he was an ironhanded patriarch.\"\nMadam Zhou"

Shapiro's translation was based on the 1953 People's Publishing House text, in which the author made corrections. Ba Jin made further changes for Shapiro's translation. The 1972 Anchor Books (New York) edition was edited  by Olga Lang, Ba Jin's biographer. The New York edition omits the article \"the\" from the title, which makes \"family\" a more general concept rather than limiting it to this particular family. In her Editor's Note, Lang discusses the history of the text, pointing out that certain passages, the anarchist elements, had been deleted from the 1958 Foreign Languages Press edition. The Anchor edition restored three prefaces by the author, newly translated, as well as some of the omitted passages.A play and two films were based on the novel. The play was adapted by famous playwright Cao Yu in 1941.   A Mainland Chinese TV adaptation, starring Huang Lei, Lu Yi and Huang Yi, was produced in 2007.\nBa Jin mentions Wu Yu (a.k.a. Wu Youling), when Juemin and Juexin discuss in a favorable manner how he is going to teach at their school. In the Sidney Shapiro translation Wu Yu is not mentioned by name; instead he is referred to as \"the man who wrote that article, 'Cannibal Confucian Morality' in the New Youth magazine\""

        "content": "Family mentions many of the books and authors which inflamed the young protagonists, giving a vivid picture of intellectual life in a provincial capital. The tone and theme was influenced by works that also influenced many Chinese authors of Ba Jin's generation, for instance A Doll's House by Henrik Ibsen, about the fate of a woman trapped in the physical and social structures of her marriage. Family is often compared to the 18th-century novel, Dream of the Red Chamber, a richly poetic and tragic chronicle of the life of a prominent family living within a great house. Though he did not mention it as a model, Ba Jin, like all educated Chinese of his time, had been familiar with the work from his youth. Where the earlier work is fatalistic and told with philosophical allegory, however, the young heroes of Family leaves home to pursue lives of worldly engagement."

According to Farmer, the song was \"very long to write\". The idea of the duet started from an \"irregular but faithful\" correspondence through letters between both singers for a year. Murat explained: \"One day, in the mailbox, I had a letter from Myl\u00e8ne. She was asking me if I wanted to sing with her. This letter is not a legend, I simply received it by the post. I could not believe my eyes: she was giving me her phone number.\" Finally Murat called her and they met in Paris.Already in 1989, Farmer confessed that she liked Murat's songs and his album Cheyenne Automne, and his way of writing. Thus, according to Murat, Farmer had the idea to record a duet with him, and he accepted after listening to an audiotape of \"Regrets\" in which Farmer sang the two voices \u2013 her own and that of Murat trying to make it deeper \u2014  which French author Julien Rigal deemed a \"legend\". At that time, Farmer said in several interviews that she considered Murat as her \"brother\", her \"double\", her \"twin\" and a \"poet\"; she called her encounter with Murat \"fantastic\". In the media, Murat said almost the same thing on this matter and on other ones, so much so that the OK magazine established a comparison of the previous interviews given in the press by both singers. However, as noted by author Erwan Chuberre, it remains impossible to really know if the duet was actually motivated by a genuine friendship or by a business strategy, given that the singers wanted to expand their fan bases at the time. In 2004, Murat said in the French newspaper L'Express that \"Regrets\" helped him to launch his career.The single was released on 29 July 1991 under various formats, including a CD maxi with a pin's in a limited edition.In 2000, the recording company scheduled to release the live version of \"Regrets\" as the second single from the album Mylenium Tour, and thus sent a promotional VHS to the radio stations. However, given the differences with Farmer who preferred \"Pas le temps de vivre\" as single and the disappointing sales of the previous live singles \"Ainsi soit je...\" and \"Dessine-moi un mouton\", the song was finally not released."

This loss leaves an unfathomable lack in the one who remains, which invests the world of dreams to regain the lost happiness. Only memories then allow to savour the well-being of the past relationship\". In his analysis of the song, the psychologist Hugues Royer stated: \"Death is a subterfuge to make the impossible love. (...) Is not it easier to romanticize a dead person than a living one who, sooner or later, will show the faces of his faults? It is indeed the fear of everyday life that terrifies the advocates of absolute love.\" About the lyrics, Farmer explained that she \"do[es] not unit the regret with the notions of disappointment and failure, rather these things that we could do, but that we decide not to do\"."

        "content": "The video is a Requiem Publishing and Heathcliff SA production whose length is 6:17. Directed by Laurent Boutonnat who also co-authored the screenplay with Farmer, the video was filmed for two days in February 1991 in a Jewish cemetery abandoned in Budapest, with a budget of about 35,000 euros. The train, which leads to the cemetery was turned on only for the video which features, in addition to the two singers, a deer. It was broadcast on television for the first time on 9 September 1991 in Stars 90 on TF1. In an interview, Murat explained that he had been very surprised by the extreme severity and great professionalism shown by Boutonnat during the video's shooting.At the beginning of the video, a tram stops in front of the entrance of a snow-covered cemetery. Murat gets off from the tram and pushes the front gate. He walks in the cemetery, passes a deer and meditates at a grave. When he sits, Farmer comes behind him and puts her hands on his eyes. Murat takes Farmer by the hand, then they run, laugh and huddled one against the other in the cemetery. They doze off on a tombstone, and after a last embrace, they say goodbye to each other and split off. The man then gets on the tram and goes away.According to the analysis made by magazine Instant-Mag, the video is the \"metaphor of a past and regretted love\". It \"shows the indispensable link between two people, as well as the inevitability of this link : we can be attached to the other person, but also lose her\". With this video, Farmer \"reached the quintessance of elegant sadness which lives in her work\". According to this analysis, the character played by Murat would be alive and would try to meet that played by Farmer who would be dead. To this end, the train would represent the transition from these two worlds. The deer who flees would be \"the symbol of the woman's essence\", and the bunch of thistles would evoke \"the desire to provoke unconditional love with the other person\". As for the immaculate snow, it would participate in the gloomy atmosphere of the video and would symbolize \"a mild but deadly mask which isolates\" the two opposing parties. Biographer Bernard Violet said that Boutonnat simply transposed the song in the video by adding his personal aesthetic, in this case, a stylized, little contrasted and overexposed black and white. Anything that expresses reality was filmed at normal speed, while all which describes dream, hope or regret, was filmed at slower speed."

The performance was actually recorded a few days earlier and the recording lasted approximately six hours as Murat, who was not used to sing on television shows at the time, had some difficulties with his lip sync. As compensation, Farmer sent crates of champagne to technicians the next day. Regarding tours, \"Regrets\" was sung only during the 1999 Mylenium Tour; on this occasion, Farmer performed the song alone, while a red fire was lighted in the hand of the blue statue of the stage.In December 2003, SitolC participated in the national competition \"T\u00e9l\u00e9 Poche\", then in two castings : \"G\u00e9n\u00e9ration M\u00e9tis\" and \"Graine de star\".

According to Elia Habib, an expert of French charts, \"Regrets\" is \"a slow [song], which successfully blends the singer's voice [that of Farmer], which merges into the melody to that of Murat, which stands out and thus puts her partner off the scent\". In contrast, French television host Marc Toesca, who presented the singles chart, said in the Best magazine that he did not particularly appreciate the song.Although \"Regrets\" was released in the summer, its sales were rather satisfactory. In France, the single started at number 20 on 24 August 1991, reached the top ten the next week and stayed there for ten consecutive weeks, including a peak at number three on 21 September. It totaled 16 weeks in the top 50. \"Regrets\" was even certified Silver disc by the Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique on 19 December 1991 for over 125,000 units. In Belgium, the song debuted at number 22, entered the top ten and reached number two for two consecutive weeks. It totaled nine weeks in the top five and 18 weeks in the top 30. In France, the single was re-edited in February 2018 and re-entered the chart at number four."

It was based on the fantasy novel series The Witcher by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. The game's story takes place after the events of the main saga.It was released in 2007 to positive reviews from critics and received an aggregate score of 81/100 on Metacritic. In 2009, a console version, The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf, was scheduled for release using an entirely new engine and combat system. This was suspended as a result of payment problems with console developers Widescreen Games. The first game has, to date, two sequels, namely The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings in 2011 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015.\nA remake of The Witcher was announced in October 2022, which was formerly first teased under the codename \"Canis Majoris\". Entitled The Witcher Remake, it will be developed using Unreal Engine 5, the same engine in use for the planned second trilogy. Fool's Theory will mainly develop the remake with full creative supervision from The Witcher series staff and CD Projekt Red."

        "content": "There are three camera styles available in The Witcher: two isometric perspectives, where the mouse is used to control most functions, and an over-the-shoulder view, which brings the player closer to the in-game combat while limiting vision. In all three views the controls can be changed to be primarily mouse focused or a combined keyboard and mouse approach.\nThe story takes place in a medieval fantasy world and follows Geralt of Rivia, one of a few traveling monster hunters who have supernatural powers, known as Witchers. Players can choose one of three fighting styles to use in different situations and against different foes. The fast style allows for more rapid, less-damaging attacks with a higher chance of hitting faster enemies; the strong style deals more damage in exchange for a slow attack speed, and a lower chance to hit faster enemies; and the group style features sweeping attacks best used if Geralt is surrounded. The player can switch between the styles at any point. Both of Geralt's main swords also have distinctively different combat styles from other weaponry, and serve specific purposes. The steel blade is used to fight humans and other flesh-and-blood beings, while the silver sword is more effective against supernatural monsters and beasts (against some of which steel may have no effect whatsoever). With precise timing, the player can link Geralt's attacks into combos to damage enemies more effectively.\nAlchemy is a significant part of the gameplay. The player can create potions that increase health or endurance regeneration, allow Geralt to see in the dark, or provide other beneficial effects. The recipes for these potions can be learned through scrolls, or by experimentation. Once the player creates an unknown potion, he can choose to drink it, but if the potion is a failure it will poison or have other harmful effects on Geralt. Each time Geralt drinks potions, they increase the toxicity level of his body. This can be reduced by drinking a special potion or by meditating at an inn or fireplace. In addition to potions, the player can create oils used to augment the damage done by weapons. They can also create bombs for use as weapons in combat. Neither can be created until talent points have been allocated into the corresponding skills.\nA time-delayed decision-consequence system means that the repercussions of players' decisions will make themselves apparent in plot devices in later acts of the game. This helps avert a save-reload approach to decision making. It also adds to the game's replay value, as the consequences resulting from the player's decisions can lead to significant differences in the events that take place later, and ultimately a very different gameplay experience than in prior playthroughs. The player often finds themselves choosing between the lesser of two evils."

However, due to several other projects that the studio was involved in at the time, and concerns from their publisher TopWare about the materials' international appeal, the project never got farther than some initial media and a playable level.CD Projekt later approached Sapkowski for rights for the series. They were able to secure the rights for about 35,000 zloty (approximately US$9,500) from Sapkowski, who wanted all the payment upfront, rather than through royalties, even though these were offered to him. In a 2017 interview, Sapkowski said that at the time he had no interest in video games, and was only looking at the deal from a financial benefit standpoint."

It is preserved in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a historical record of events in Anglo-Saxon England which was kept from the late ninth to the mid-twelfth century. The poem records the Battle of Brunanburh, a battle fought in 937 between an English army and a combined army of Scots, Vikings, and Britons. The battle resulted in an English victory, celebrated by the poem in style and language like that of traditional Old English battle poetry. The poem is notable because of those traditional elements and has been praised for its authentic tone, but it is also remarkable for its fiercely nationalistic tone, which documents the development of a unified England ruled by the House of Wessex."

        "content": "The Battle of Brunanburh was a culmination of the conflict between King \u00c6thelstan and the northern kings. After \u00c6thelstan had defeated the Vikings at York in 928, Constantine II, the Scottish King, recognised the threat posed by the House of Wessex to his own position, and began forging alliances with neighbouring kingdoms to attempt a pre-emptive strike against \u00c6thelstan. He married his daughter to Amla\u00edb mac Gofraid (also called Olaf Guthfrithsson, and Anlaf in the poem), the Norse-Gael King of Dublin. Amla\u00edb had a claim to the throne of Northumbria, from which \u00c6thelstan expelled his father in 927. Thus, the invading army combined \"Vikings, Scots, and Strathclyde Britons.\" On the English side, \u00c6thelstan was joined by his brother, the later King Edmund. In the ensuing battle, the combined forces of Wessex and Mercia won a decisive victory."

        "content": "The poem is preserved in four of the nine surviving manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. In the Parker Chronicle, its verse lines are written out as poetry, following common Anglo-Saxon scribal practice. The 73-line long poem is written in \"indeterminate Saxon,\" that is, the regular West-Saxon dialect in which most surviving Old English poetry is copied. It is referred to as a panegyric celebrating the victory of \u00c6thelstan and Edmund I.The text begins by praising King \u00c6thelstan and his brother Edmund I for their victory. It mentions the fall of \"Scots and seafarers\" in a battle that lasted an entire day, while \"the battlefield flowed / with dark blood.\" \"Norse seafarer[s]\" and \"weary Scot[s]\" were killed by \"West Saxons [who] / pursued those hateful people\", killing them from behind with their swords; neither did \"the Mercians...stint / hard handplay\". \"Five young kings\" are killed in battle along with \"seven / of Anlaf's earls\". Amla\u00edb mac Gofraid (\"Anlaf\") flees by boat, and Constantine flees to: the north, leaving \"his son / savaged by weapons on that field of slaughter, / a mere boy in battle.\" The poem concludes by comparing the battle to those fought in earlier stages of English history:\n\nNever, before this,\nwere more men in this island slain\nby the sword's edge--as books and aged sages\nconfirm--since Angles and Saxons sailed here\nfrom the east, sought the Britons over the wide seas,\nsince those warsmiths hammered the Welsh,\nand earls, eager for glory, overran the land."

        "title": "Battle of Brunanburh (poem)_p2",
        "content": "The style of the poem has been described as \"sagalike in its sparse use of language combined with ample specific detail.\" According to George Anderson, since the poem comes so late in the Old English period, it gives evidence of the continuing attraction of the \"warrior tradition\": it is \"clear and convincing testimony to the vitality of the Old English battle-epic tradition; the authentic ring sounds out years after the Beowulf Poet, Caedmon, and Cynewulf have been laid to rest.\" Donald Fry compares passages from Beowulf and Brunanburh (concerning the boarding of ships) and remarks on the \"similar diction and imagery\". According to Malcolm Godden, the language resembles that of the Old English Genesis A. The poem is not without its detractors: an early critic, Walter J. Sedgefield, in a 1904 study of the poems in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, said \"even the longest and best written of their number, the Battle of Brunanburh, is but a simulacrum, a ghost of the older epos\". That the poem should not be treated as a historical text, and that panegyric was the appropriate genre, was argued by Alistair Campbell: \"The poet's subjects are the praise of heroes and the glory of victory. When this is realised, the oft-repeated criticism, that he does not greatly add to our knowledge of the battle, falls to the ground. It was not his object to do so. He was not writing an epic or a 'ballad.' He was writing a panegyric.\" Townend agrees, and notes that praise-poems on contemporary men are completely missing from the Anglo-Saxon period until a cluster of four panegyrics including Brunanburh in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.Compared to \"The Battle of Maldon\", an Old English poem that commemorates a battle between English and Vikings half a century later, Brunanburh is notable for its nationalist overtones, whereas Maldon celebrates Christian over non-Christian values. Indeed, the poem is seen as celebrating a logical progression in the development of England as a unified nation ruled by the House of Wessex; the battle reports \"the dawning of a sense of nationality, ....a crisis in which a nation is involved\". In this respect, Brunanburh is closer to the Anglo-Saxon poem The Taking of the Five Boroughs, also found in the Chronicle under the year 942, celebrating King Edmund's recapture of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. But while the poet claims veracity, Michael Swanton notes, \"it is ironic in view of his primarily historic concerns that he is in fact more successful than the Maldon-poet in transmitting the traditional poetic style.\" Peter Clemoes argues in Interactions of Thought and Language in Old English Poetry that Brunanburh, as opposed to Maldon, relies on \"uncomplicated patriotic triumphalism\". The poem does not treat \"personal responsibility\" as Maldon does, but leans on an expansive view of history which sees the battle, in line with the Chronicle's view of contemporary history as the \"epitome of Anglo-Saxon, especially West Saxon, history with antecedents in the history of Britain\", as \"straightforwardly traditional\". According to Patrick Wormald, the poem builds on the \"sense of ideological identity that the English had been given by Bede.\"\nThis poet from the 10th century is recalling the Germanic conquest of England which occurred in the 5th century; he connects his memory of this present victory, which must have been very moving for the Saxons \u2014 for it was more common for the Norse to defeat them, and rare for them to be the victors \u2014 he linked it to the often secular victories enjoyed by the first Germanic peoples who arrived in England.\nAccompanying the combatants are the usual \"beasts of battle\" found in other Old English poems\u2014the wolf, the raven, and the eagle. The Battle of Brunanburh, however, seems to include a fourth animal, the gu\u00fehafoc (literally Goshawk), or \"war-hawk,\" in line 64. However, editors and scholars of the poem have suggested that graedigne gu\u00fehafoc, \"greedy war-hawk\", is actually a kenning for the hasu-padan, / earn \u00e6ftan hwit, the \"dusky coated, white-tailed eagle\" of lines 62b-63a.Simon Walker suggests that was written at Worcester, under the influence of its bishop, Koenwald, and that the emphasis on Edmund's contribution suggests that it was written during his reign. Sarah Foot finds the arguments for the first suggestion convincing but not the second."

The now-accepted standard edition of the poem is the 1938 edition by Alistair Campbell. The Battle of Brunanburh: A Casebook, edited by Michael Livingston, was published by the University of Exeter Press in 2011; it includes two alternative translations of the poem and essays on the battle and the poem.The twelfth-century Anglo-Norman chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar likely used the account in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for his treatment of \u00c6thelstan in his L'Estoire des Engles. English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson translated (or \"modernized\") the poem in 1880, publishing it as part of his Ballads and Other Poems (and his son Hallam Tennyson published a prose translation of the poem). In contrast to many other translations of poetry, Tennyson's is still praised as \"a faithful, sensitive, even eloquent recreation of its source.\" The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges wrote a short poem, \"Brunanburh 937 AD,\" a translation of which was published in The New Yorker. In a 1968 lecture at Harvard University, Borges praised Tennyson's translation, stating that in some locutions Tennyson sounds \"more Saxon than the original.\" A translation by Burton Raffel is included in Alexandra Hennessey Olsen's anthology Poems and prose from the Old English."

The spelling Ian is an Anglicization of the Scottish Gaelic forename Iain. This name is a popular name in Scotland, where it originated, as well as in other English-speaking countries.\nThe name has fallen out of the top 100 male baby names in the United Kingdom, having peaked in popularity as one of the top 10 names throughout the 1960s. In 1900, Ian ranked as the 180th most popular male baby name in England and Wales. As of 2019, the name has been in the top 100 in the United States every year since 1982, peaking at 65 in 2003.Other Gaelic forms of  the name \"John\" include \"Seonaidh\" (\"Johnny\" from Lowland Scots), \"Seon\" (from English), \"Seathan\", and \"Se\u00e1n\" and \"Eoin\" (from Irish). The Welsh equivalent is Ioan, the Cornish counterpart is Yowan and the Breton equivalent is Yann."

It is the first album by the band recorded without guitarist Steve Clark, who died in 1991, although most songs were written and partially demoed before his death, they were re-recorded solo by Phil Collen in 1991-1992. It is the only album recorded by Def Leppard as a four-member band. Spawning seven singles, four of them \u2013 \"Let's Get Rocked\", \"Make Love Like a Man\", \"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\", and \"Stand Up (Kick Love into Motion)\" \u2013 were major hits.\n\"Tear It Down\" is a re-recording of a song written during a recording session following the completion of the Hysteria album, and released as B-side for that album's single \"Women\" in 1987. The song received radio airplay and was performed by the band live at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\"White Lightning\" is dedicated to the memory of Clark, who has writing credits on six of the album's ten tracks."

At the same time guitarist Steve Clark had been suffering from alcohol addiction since 1989, spending six sessions in rehab. Clark was involved in writing six of the songs on the album, but was given an ultimatum over his alcoholism in September 1990, and put on a six-month leave of absence. Clark died four months later, in January 1991.\nThe band tried to continue the recording process, going back into the studio the day after Clark's death to cope with the loss, but it took several months before they were able to work to what they felt was a satisfactory standard."

I could relay that. But it was like playing along to a ghost.\"This was also the band's first album since 1980's On Through the Night not to be produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange. Instead, the band took matters in their own hands and produced the album themselves along with longtime engineer Mike Shipley; with Lange credited as executive producer.\"We coped without Mutt quite well\u2026\" recalled Joe Elliott. \"Mutt was in his studio in Guildford with Bryan Adams and we'd be in Dublin, talking every day\u2026 But it wasn't as adventurous as Hysteria. It was more of a rock album, less experimental. It's like with Pink Floyd: to me, Adrenalize was our Wish You Were Here and Hysteria was our Dark Side of the Moon.\""

It stayed at No. 1 of the Billboard chart for five weeks keeping Bruce Springsteen's Human Touch off the top spot, and spent 65 weeks on the charts in total. \nThe album received mixed reviews: some critics praised its production values and instantly catchy and radio-friendly material, while others called it tired and formulaic. In a four-star review for Rolling Stone, J.D. Considine wrote: \"Adrenalize is so relentlessly catchy that it almost seems as if the band is about to abandon its heavy-metal roots for the greener fields of hard pop.\" Other reviewers also noted the album's less metal sound and pointed out its lack of cohesion. A staff writer for Sputnikmusic said that, despite the slick production, the album doesn't match the standard set by the band's previous two records, which they referred to as masterpieces.\"Writing in 2009, after Pyromania and Adrenalize have been reissued, Toby Cook of The Quietus said that, despite Adrenalize's many flaws, \"the record buying public of '92 cared not.\" Indeed, the album would go on to sell more than seven million copies worldwide, remaining Def Leppard's last studio album to achieve major mainstream success."

Using the study of comparative writing styles (palaeography), it is usually dated to the 9th century CE, though a few palaeographers would place it in the 10th century CE.

The text is written in one column per page, 17-28 lines per page, in large semi-uncial letters using brown and black ink.  The Latin text is written above the Greek (as in Codex Boernerianus), and in minuscule letters. It is decorated, but the decorations were made by an inartistic hand.:\u200a82\u200a The manuscript from which Sangallensis was copied (known as its Vorlage/examplar) was likely written stichometrically.:\u200a158\u200a Quotations from the Old Testament are indicated.The text is divided according to Ammonian Sections, whose numbers are given at the margin, with references to the Eusebian Canons (both early systems of dividing the four Gospels into different sections) in Roman letters written below the Ammonian Section numbers. The top of the pages contain the \u03c4\u03b9\u03c4\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 (titles of chapters). It contains Prologues, the Epistle of Jerome to Pope Damasus I (a letter outlining Jerome's Latin translation of the Gospels), the Eusebian Canon Tables, and the tables of contents (known as \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1 / kephalaia) before each gospel in both Greek and Latin.:\u200a157\u200a Brief subscriptions are written after each gospel.The text of 7:16 was originally omitted but inserted by a later hand,:\u200a111\u200a and 11:26 is omitted without being added later.:\u200a126\u200a The Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11) is omitted, but a blank space was left for the remainder of the 348th page. The texts of Matthew 16:2b-3 and John 5:4 are included without any indications of spuriousness, but Luke 22:43 is marked by asterisks to express doubt as to its inclusion."

        "content": "Nymphomaniac (stylised as NYMPH()MANIAC onscreen and in advertising) is a 2013 erotic art film written and directed by Lars von Trier. The film stars Charlotte Gainsbourg, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Stacy Martin, Shia LaBeouf, Christian Slater, Jamie Bell, Uma Thurman, Jean-Marc Barr, Willem Dafoe, Connie Nielsen, and Mia Goth in her debut. Separated as two-part films, the plot follows Joe (played by Gainsbourg and Martin), a self-diagnosed \"nymphomaniac,\" who recounts her erotic experiences to a bachelor who helps her recover from an assault. The narrative chronicles Joe's promiscuous life from adolescence to adulthood and is split into eight chapters told across two volumes. The film was originally supposed to be only one complete entry, but, because of its length, von Trier made the decision to split the project into two separate films. Nymphomaniac was an international co-production of Denmark, Belgium, France, and Germany.\nThe world premiere of the uncut Volume I occurred on 16 February 2014 at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival, while the uncut Volume II premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival. The world premiere of the Director's Cut took place in Copenhagen on 10 September 2014. It was nominated for the 2014 Nordic Council Film Prize.\nNymphomaniac is the third and final installment in von Trier's unofficially titled Depression Trilogy, following Antichrist and Melancholia."

Seligman, a highly educated but cloistered man, connects and analyzes Joe's stories with what he has read about. Seligman's favourite hobby to read about is fly fishing, which is why he has a fly fishing lure on his wall and this is how their conversation begins. Throughout the story he parallels much of what she has experienced with various methods of the sport."

Each appetizer represented each of the eight chapters of Nymphomaniac and the first one, entitled \"The Compleat Angler\", appeared on 28 June 2013, the last Friday of the month\u2014this pattern would be followed for the monthly release of the subsequent clips.

Along with the appetizers and the character posters, five theatrical posters (three for the complete feature and one for each volume) and an international trailer featuring some of the explicit sexual scenes, were released.In July 2014, Zentropa revealed the poster for the Director's Cut when announcing its premiere at the Venice Film Festival.

        "content": "Von Trier's complete five-and-a-half-hour version was released in few territories and only long after the original premiere. Instead, a four-hour version was edited without the director's involvement and has been used for the film's international release, divided into two volumes \u2013 Volume I and Volume II \u2013 with ninety minutes removed.\n\n Lars von Trier's upcoming NYMPHOMANIAC is distributed in two parts (Volume I and II) and two versions (one lasting four hours in total, one in five and a half hours in total). From 25 December 2013, and approximately four months ahead, the four-hour long NYMPHOMANIAC Volume I and II is released worldwide. In some territories the two volumes will be released at the same time, and in some territories the volumes will be released apart. Each country has its own rules of censorship and in order to create cohesion between each country's distribution strategies the four-hour long version will be the one released first. And even this version is expected to meet minor additional changes in certain countries. Just as Lars von Trier gave consent to the making of different censored versions of ANTICHRIST, when that film was released, Trier has also approved of this version of NYMPHOMANIAC. Technically the changes in the abridged version consist of an editing-out of the most explicit close-ups of genitals and the film has, in agreement with Lars von Trier, been shortened by his editors to a length, which has been decided upon in collaboration with several of the film's stakeholders, two parts of two hours each. The five-and-a-half-hour long version of NYMPHOMANIAC Volume I and II expect to be finalized for distribution sometime in 2014. When, exactly, is to be confirmed. This version will be distributed in those parts of the world where laws of censorship allow. Ever since NYMPHOMANIAC was announced as Lars von Trier's next project it's been out in the open that the film would be distributed in different versions, ensuring financing, and as widespread distribution of NYMPHOMANIAC as possible, and finally to ensure Lars von Trier as much artistic freedom as possible.\n\n We knew from the beginning that there would be various versions. But we didn't really work with that. We worked with one film, and that's the film that is Lars' version, the Director's Cut. Then, after we'd worked with that for eight months, we used a month to do the shorter version. So it wasn't really like trying to do different versions at once. We just did one film \u2013 a film that we really liked. A long film with a break, basically.\n\nA \"secret\" advance screening of Volume I occurred at the Sundance Film Festival on 21 January 2014, at the Egyptian Theater with tickets distributed bearing the film title \"Film X\" amidst rumors the film could either be von Trier's film, or Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel. The film's UK premiere took place on 22 February 2014. In the United States, the film was also released in two parts, billed as Nymphomaniac: Volume I and Nymphomaniac: Volume II, but on separate dates: 21 March 2014 and 4 April 2014.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the four-hour version of the film was distributed by the Transmission Films company. Released on 20 March 2014, the two volumes were shown back-to-back with an interval.In February 2014, the uncut Volume I was screened at the Berlin Film Festival. In September 2014, the uncut version of Volume I and Volume II was screened at the Venice Film Festival. The complete Director's Cut, including both volumes, was finally released to a general audience in Copenhagen, Denmark, premiering on 10 September 2014, where it was shown with a half-hour intermission at a red carpet gala screening with von Trier present in the audience; at this premiere, during the film's restored abortion sequence, where Joe performs an abortion on herself, three male audience members fainted and had to be carried out of the cinema."

The second volume gained a 60/100 rating based on 34 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".In the UK, Martin Solibakke of Mancunion praised Stacy Martin's performance, saying he had \"never felt so sure about an actress's future success since I saw Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone four years ago\". He ended his review with hailing the film, saying \"Lars von Trier ends up hitting the G-spot of avant-garde filmmaking with a movie only he could ever make, and gives the open-minded members of the audience one of the most powerful and sensational experiences ever seen in arts.\"Michelle Orange of The Village Voice called it a \"jigsaw opus, an extended and generally exquisitely crafted riff.\" In The Australian, David Stratton said that he \"detested\" some of Trier's films, and states that Nymphomaniac \"seems designed to be his magnum opus, the film in which he gets to rail against everything he loathes about contemporary life and contemporary cinema.\" The modified version is screening in Australia, officially referred to as the \"international\" version. Stratton further stated on the television review program At the Movies that he found the four-hour runtime of the film to be \"daunting\", but praised some of the performances, particularly those of Stacy Martin and Jamie Bell. Stratton's co-host Margaret Pomeranz meanwhile, while also praising the boldness of the performances, felt the film's unsimulated depictions of sex didn't add to the narrative and as such had, \"such an undercurrent of sadism that I was, not repelled, but distanced\". Thought Catalog remarked on how the plot failed to be consistent or plausible.Keith Uhlich of The A.V. Club named Nymphomaniac the third-best film of 2014.On the Melbourne community radio station, 3RRR, film criticism program \"Plato's Cave\" praised von Trier's work on Nymphomaniac and presenters, Thomas Caldwell and Josh Nelson, defended the director against accusations of misogyny. Both presenters agreed that actresses who von Trier has worked with, such as Nicole Kidman and Bj\u00f6rk, have delivered excellent performances in his films, while Nelson referred to Antichrist and Melancholia, the first two installments of the Depression Trilogy, as \"masterpieces\". Caldwell concludes the review by stating, \"... if you're coming new to him [von Trier], I think this is a real crash course in all his preoccupations.\"When the complete Director's Cut had its general release world premiere in Copenhagen on 10 September 2014, major Danish critics gave it high ratings. In spite of this, the Director's Cut sold only 3,494 tickets in Danish cinemas.The film makes several references to the other films. For example, the scene showing Marcel approaching an open upper floor window references the similar sequence during the beginning of Antichrist and even uses the same background music from that aforementioned scene."

        "content": "The film begins in Ryazan in 1875, and tells about the work of Ivan Pavlov from his first steps in science to sensational discoveries which played a huge role in the development of medicine and psychology.\nThe young doctor Ivan Pavlov wants to live life \"honorably and humanely.\" The path of the scientist is difficult and thorny. The treasury department does not release funds for research nor give access to animals for experimental use, and Pavlov has to buy them on his own savings. The experiments follow one another. Pavlov is pursuing his goal with passion and force. For his work on the physiology of digestion, he is awarded the Nobel Prize. Pavlov paves the way for objective studies of brain function in higher animals. Zvantsev, the assistant of Pavlov is an idealist who has become an ideological opponent of the scientist-materialist, implores him not to interfere with the \"sanctuary of the spirit\", but Pavlov boldly ignores his opponents-obscurantists. The revolutionary 1917 year comes. Pavlov angrily rejects the proposal of an American agent to go abroad; he decides to forever remain with his people in his homeland."

        "content": "Dredd is a 2012 science fiction action film directed by Pete Travis and written and produced by Alex Garland. It is based on the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd and its eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. Karl Urban stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, dystopic metropolis called Mega-City One that lies in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Dredd and his rookie partner, Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey high-rise block of apartments and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).\nGarland began writing the script in 2006, although the development of a new Judge Dredd film adaptation, unrelated to the 1995 film Judge Dredd, was not announced until December 2008. Produced by British studio DNA Films, Dredd began principal photography, using 3D cameras throughout, in November 2010. Filming took place on practical sets and locations in Cape Town and Johannesburg.\nDredd was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's visual effects, casting and action sequences, while criticism focused on excessive violence as well as a perceived lack of the satirical elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30\u201345 million. Dredd saw greater success following its home release and has since been recognised as a cult film. The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely, but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by 2000 AD's publisher Rebellion Developments have maintained the possibility of a second film."

        "content": "In 2080, most of the United States is a dystopic post nuclear war wasteland known as the Cursed Earth. On the east coast lies Mega-City One, a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 serious crimes reported daily. The only force for order are the Judges, who act as judge, jury, and executioner. Judge Dredd is tasked by the Chief Judge with evaluating new recruit Cassandra Anderson, a powerful psychic who marginally failed the aptitude tests to become a Judge.\nIn a 200-storey slum tower block called Peach Trees, drug lord Madeline \"Ma-Ma\" Madrigal executes three rogue drug dealers by having them skinned alive. They are infused with Slo-Mo (an addictive new drug that reduces the user's perception of time to 1% of normal) and thrown down to the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay, whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one that carried out the executions, and Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building (closing its blast shield doors under the pretext of a security test) to prevent the Judges from leaving or summoning help.\nMa-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, forcing the Judges to fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with rotary cannons that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. The Judges breach an outer wall and call for backup. Meanwhile, Ma-Ma sends her henchman Caleb to search for the Judges. When they meet, Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma-Ma.\nDredd suspects Ma-Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson reads Kay's mind and learns Peach Trees is the center of Slo-Mo production and distribution. Anderson suggests they hide while awaiting assistance, but Dredd insists they move up the tower and pursue Ma-Ma. Judges Volt and Guthrie respond to Dredd's call, but Ma-Ma's computer expert denies them entry by persuading them the security system is malfunctioning. A pair of armed teens confront Dredd and Anderson, allowing Kay to disarm and overpower Anderson. Kay then escapes with her as a hostage and takes her to Ma-Ma's base on the top floor.\nWhile Dredd works his way toward Ma-Ma, she calls in the corrupt Judges Lex, Kaplan, Chan, and Alvarez. The four relieve Volt and Guthrie from duty and are allowed into the building. Dredd encounters Chan and is suspicious that he does not ask about Anderson's status. Seeing his cover blown, Chan attacks Dredd but is killed. Meanwhile, Kay tries to execute Anderson with her own weapon, but the pistol's DNA scanner does not recognize him and explodes, taking his hand off. She escapes and later encounters Kaplan, whom she promptly kills after reading her mind. Elsewhere, Dredd kills Alvarez but runs out of ammunition. He is subsequently shot and injured by Lex, but Dredd stalls him long enough for Anderson to arrive and kill Lex.\nAnderson and Dredd obtain the code to Ma-Ma's apartment from her computer expert and confront her. Ma-Ma tells Dredd that if she dies, a device on her wrist will detonate explosives on the top floors, destroying the building. Because of this, Dredd predicts that the detonator's signal could not reach the explosives from the ground floor. He forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her down the atrium to her death; the explosives fail to detonate.\nIn the aftermath, Anderson accepts that she has failed her evaluation by getting disarmed and leaves. The Chief Judge asks Dredd about Anderson's performance; he responds that she has passed."

        "content": "Karl Urban as Dredd: A famed and feared Judge. Producer Allon Reich described Dredd as \"an extreme character, and he administers justice with an extreme lack of prejudice\". Urban approached the producers about joining the film. He found the role challenging because the character never removes his helmet, requiring Urban to convey emotion without using his eyes. He viewed the character as an average man with an insanely tough job in a fragmenting society and likened Dredd's heroism to that of a fireman. The role also demanded physical preparation; Urban undertook intensive physical training to become a \"beast of a man\". He also underwent weapons and technical training to learn how to operate under fire, arrest criminals and breach doors. He insisted on performing his own motorcycle stunts for the film. He played Dredd with a raspy and harsh vocal tone akin to \"a saw cutting through bone\", which he found difficult to sustain.Olivia Thirlby as Cassandra Anderson:A rookie Judge and genetic mutant with powerful psychic abilities. Anderson can sense the thoughts and emotions of others. Thirlby contrasted her character with Dredd's \"black and white\" perspective, describing Anderson as existing \"in a grey area where everything is enhanced or clouded by the fact [that] she knows what is going on in the very interior of a person\". She undertook weapons and combat training, learning to perform a roundhouse kick to make her believably physically commanding. The character was partially inspired by singer Debbie Harry.\nLena Headey as Madeline \"Ma-Ma\" Madrigal: A former prostitute turned drug lord and criminal kingpin who is the sole supplier of \"Slo-Mo\", a new and addictive drug. Headey's performance was inspired by punk-rock singer Patti Smith. Reich described the character as someone who does \"not care at all about what anybody thinks or feels and she will do, and behave, as she wants\". Headey said: \"I think of [Ma-Ma] like an old great white shark who is just waiting for someone bigger and stronger to show up and kill her ... she's ready for it. In fact, she can't wait for it to happen ... She's an addict, so she's dead in that way, but that last knock just hasn't come.\" Before Headey's casting, the character was envisioned as a heavily made-up, scarred and obese older woman.\nWood Harris as Kay: Ma-Ma's clansman. Harris described the character as a villain, but one that sees himself as no worse than the Judges. Harris said: \" ... Dredd goes around literally judging and killing people if they do wrong ... Anyone who goes against the system might end up the bad guy. So I think Kay has justified fighting that in his mind.\"The cast also includes: Domhnall Gleeson as the gang's unnamed computer expert; Warrick Grier as Ma-Ma's enforcer Caleb; DeObia Oparei as TJ, Peach Trees' medic; Francis Chouler as Judge Guthrie, Daniel Hadebe as Judge Volt, and Rakie Ayola as the Chief Judge. Langley Kirkwood, Edwin Perry, Karl Thaning, and Michele Levin portray, respectively, the corrupt Judges Lex, Alvarez, Chan, and Kaplan. Dredd also features Junior Singo as Amos and Luke Tyler as Freel, young boys who confront Dredd; Jason Cope as Zwirner, the thug executed by Dredd during the opening scene; Joe Vaz as Big Joe, the thug that leads the confrontation outside of the med station; Scott Sparrow as Japhet, Anderson's first execution; and Nicole Bailey as Cathy, Japhet's wife, in whose apartment the Judges take refuge."

        "content": "Paul Leonard-Morgan wrote the film's industrial music score. Leonard-Morgan created music to suit the film's futuristic setting. He experimented with band-based music, but decided it sounded over-produced and too safe. He turned to electronic music and used 1980s-style synthesisers and modern sound modules to create various combinations and applied distortion and other effects to the result. Leonard-Morgan said, \"I was looking to create a timeless score which couldn't be placed in any particular era. So it's ended up being a cross between a modern dance track and evocative soundscapes.\" For scenes conveying the effect of the Slo-Mo narcotic, he composed new music with real instruments and then slowed the songs down to match the visuals, such that one second of his composed score could last ten minutes (slowed to 0.17% of original). He then added additional real-time score to the slowed track.An unofficially altered Justin Bieber song served as inspiration for the Slo-Mo theme. Garland said that Portishead instrumentalist Geoff Barrow \"sent me a link to a Justin Bieber song slowed down 800 times and it became this stunning trippy choral music.\" Morgan recreated the effect based on the modified track, which was used in the finished film. The film used Bieber's music as a temporary placeholder during editing before the score was finalised.The film also features songs by artists including: \"Poison Lips\" by Vitalic; \"Dubstride\" by Yann McCullough and Gemma Kicks; \"Snuffbox\" by Matt Berry; \"Pontiac Moon\" by Robert J.

Ma-Ma forms a relationship with Eric\u2014the creator of Slo-Mo. Lester kills Eric for interfering with his business, Ma-Ma castrates Lester with her teeth in retaliation and Ma-Ma takes over the Slo-Mo operation.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 80%, based on 171 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Fueled by bombastic violence and impressive special effects, rooted in self-satire and deadpan humor, Dredd 3D does a remarkable job of capturing its source material's gritty spirit.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 60 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"B\" on a scale of A+ to F. Some reviewers enjoyed its take on the titular character, IGN praising it as a \"character study\".Urban's acting was frequently praised, particularly his ability to perform a characterless figure. Entertainment Weekly's Darren Franich enjoyed his \"credibly wry performance using little more than his gravelly, imitation-[Clint] Eastwood voice\u2014and his chin\". Indiewire argued that with the film, he \"continues to distinguish himself as a versatile performer who turns mimicry into emotional meaning\". Variety's Geoff Berkshire wrote the actor \"does a fine job embodying the more mythic qualities of Dredd as an upright law enforcer no lowlife would want to confront\".Thirlby's Anderson was also highlighted, such as by Berkshire for carrying the film's emotional story and said, \"one of the film's true thrills comes in watching Thirlby effortlessly balance the conflict between a Judge's merciless duties and a psychic's compassionate understanding.\" The New Statesman's Laura Sneddon noted that Dredd passed the Bechdel test, lacking in sexism or misogyny and positively portraying female characters who are no weaker, more sexualised or shown less than their male counterparts. Sneddon described Anderson as repeatedly shown to have power over men who underestimate her, while Ma-Ma displays more intelligence and sadism than any of her male gang members, and neither woman interacts with the other on the basis of their gender.Many US newspaper critics were less taken with the film. Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times called it \"a clunk-headed action picture\" that \"simply becomes a monotonous series of bad-guy confrontations\". Frank Lovece of Newsday described it as a \"soullessly gritty\" film, which apart from one believable scene involving Thirlby, is \"all tough-guy talk and humorless cynicism\". Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger called it a \"gray and ugly film\", said that there was little to draw viewers in, and wrote that apart from the drug-induced slow-motion sequences, the film offers nothing new. The Hollywood Reporter's Stephen Dalton wrote that the \"dark, ironic, very British humour of the original strip\" was largely absent from the film and that \"[t]he limited location, computer game-style plot and muted humour\" of the film might disappoint some fans of the comic. Dalton also said that Urban's performance, while close to the comic, lacked something. Overall Dalton said, \"[p]itched at the right level to please original fans, but still slick and accessible enough to attract new ones, [Dredd] feels like a smart and muscular addition to the sci-fi action genre.\"The visual effects and slow-motion sequences induced by Slo-Mo received broad praise. Berkshire said that they are notable and eye-catching with \"impressively utilised 3D.\" Hewitt said the visuals were \"genuinely surreal splashes of heightened colour that ... don't outstay their welcome. The film's use of 3D is often excellent (including the credits) and it really comes to life in the Slo-mo scenes\". Dalton said the film \"constantly impresses on a visual level, with a gritty style more akin to cult hits like District 9 or 28 Days Later than to standard Hollywood comic-book blockbusters.\" Dalton said, \"[Mantle's] first venture into 3D is a blaze of saturated colours, gorgeous high-resolution close-ups and dazzling slow-motion sequences.\" Dredd won The Art of 3D award at the 2013 Empire Awards, and was nominated for Best British Film and Best Science-fiction/Fantasy.Judge Dredd creator John Wagner, who had been critical of the 1995 adaptation, gave a positive review of Dredd. He said: \"I liked the movie. It was, unlike the first film, a true representation of Judge Dredd ... Karl Urban was a fine Dredd and I'd be more than happy to see him in the follow-up. Olivia Thirlby excelled as Anderson ... The character and storyline are pure Dredd.\" Dredd has been recognised as a cult film since its release. Some reviewers drew comparisons between Dredd and The Raid: Redemption, another action film released a few months earlier, noting that similar elements in setting, story, and characters made Dredd appear derivative. However, Garland and Urban explained that the timing of when the films were shot would have made plagiarism impossible."

A second film would focus on the origins of Dredd and Mega-City One, and a third would introduce Dredd's nemeses, the undead Judge Death and his Dark Judges. In August 2012, Garland said that a Judge Dredd television series would be a positive future step for the series. In September 2012, Garland said that he would explore the \"Origins\" and \"Democracy\" storylines, would introduce characters Judge Cal and Chopper, and would pursue the concept that Judge Dredd is a fascist. That same month, Macdonald said that further films would be made in partnership with IM Global and would likely be shot in South Africa.In March 2013, executive producer Adi Shankar said that a sequel was unlikely. In May 2013, Urban said that a sequel was still possible, noting that the film had found an audience, and the response of fans could resurrect the project. Dredd fans on Facebook launched a petition calling for a sequel. In July 2013, 2000 AD endorsed the fan petition, supporting the campaign by printing advertisements in their publications, and by September 2013 it had attracted over 80,000 signatures. In April 2013, 2000 AD released an image teasing a continuation of the film in comic book form with a release date scheduled for September 2013. The comic, titled Dredd: Underbelly, was made available in Judge Dredd Megazine #340 which was released on 18 September 2013.In October 2014, Shankar announced the production of an unofficial spinoff online series based on the Dark Judges that would be released later that month. The animated miniseries was titled Judge Dredd: Superfiend and all its six episodes were released on 27 October 2014 on YouTube. In March 2015, Garland said that a direct sequel would likely not happen in the near future, at least not with the crew involved in the original film.In 2016, Urban said that \"conversations are happening\" regarding a Dredd continuation on streaming services Netflix or Amazon Prime. In an interview in May 2016, Urban said that while the film's \"mishandled\" marketing strategy and \"unfortunate\" box office performance meant that it was \"problematic\" to try to make a sequel, \"the success it has achieved in all post-theatrical mediums has definitely strengthened the argument in favour of a sequel.\" In May 2017, a television series named Judge Dredd: Mega-City One was announced to be in development by IM Global Television and Rebellion. In August 2017, Urban stated he was in discussion to star in the series."

The lyrics tell the story of a woman singer who has just completed a successful performance and awaits a handsome man named Mr. Davidson to come backstage to congratulate her. In the words of Townshend, \"it looks like she's all set, not only for stardom but also for true love\". But when Mr. Davidson bends over to kiss her, her body odour turns him off, ruining her chances at both stardom and love. The song ends with the admonishment that \"Her deodorant had let her down / She should have used Odorono\".The song represents the increasing importance of narrative in Townshend's songwriting. Townshend was proud of the song, stating that he \"dug\" it because \"it was a little story, and although I thought it's a good song, it was about something groovy \u2014underarm perspiration.\" Of the singer's hopes being disappointed, Townshend went on to say: \"And you know, without getting too serious about it, because it's supposed to be very light, that's life. It really is. That really is life.\"The Mr. Davidson in the song may have referred to Harold Davidson, who was a famous booking agent in London at the time the song was written. Although the song is a fake commercial, a real deodorant product named Odorono once existed.The Who recorded \"Odorono\" on 11 October 1967 at IBC Studios.

The composition of the score was divided between C\u00e9sar Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, and Aleksandr Borodin, including interpolated ballet music by Ludwig Minkus. The project was never completed, and although much of the score was composed, no performing edition is currently in use. However, a printed version, primarily in piano-vocal score, based upon materials available at the time, was published in 2016 by A-R Editions under the editorship of Albrecht Gaub.This work is not to be confused with the completed and occasionally performed opera-ballet Mlada (1890) by Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, which uses the same libretto by Viktor Krylov, but is otherwise a different composition."

        "content": "Mlada was conceived in 1870 by Stepan Gedeonov, director of the Imperial Theatres (1867\u20131875), as a ballet to be choreographed by Marius Petipa with music by Alexander Serov. The plot of Mlada was adapted, with a new time and place, from a ballet by Filippo Taglioni entitled The Shadow (French: L'Ombre, Russian: \u0422\u0463\u043d\u044c, Tye\u00f1 ), which premiered in 1839 in Saint Petersburg.\nSerov died, however, in 1871 before composing anything for the work. Gedeonov revised his conception as an opera-ballet, with a libretto by Viktor Kr\u00eflov, and in 1872 proposed through Vladimir Stasov a collaborative effort by four members of The Mighty Handful\u2014C\u00e9sar Cui, Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, Modest Mussorgsky, and Aleksandr Borodin\u2014who were to write music for the sung portions of the libretto and dramatic action. Ludwig Minkus, at that time the Bolshoy Kamenniy Theatre's First Imperial Ballet Composer, was to write ballet music to be inserted at various points.\nRimsky-Korsakov provides the following details concerning the work's genesis in his memoirs, Chronicle of My Musical Life, 1909:\n\n\"Gedeonov, Director of the Imperial Theatres at the time, had conceived the idea of producing a work which should combine ballet, opera and spectacle. For this purpose he had written the program of a stage performance in four acts on a subject borrowed from the Elbe slavs and had commissioned V. A. Kr\u00eflov to work up the text. Mlada, with its mixture of fantasy and everyday reality, was a most grateful subject for musical treatment. Gedeonov asked Cui, Borodin, Mussorgsky, and myself to compose music for it; moreover, Minkus, the official ballet composer of the Imperial Theatres, was to compose the incidental ballet music. Who the initiator of this order was, I do not know. I suspect here the influence of Lukashevich, an official of the Board of Directors of the Theatres, who had begun to gain power under Gedeonov... I also believe that the connection had not happened without V. V. Stasov's having something to do with it. The four of us were invited to Gedeonov's for a joint deliberation on the work. Act 1, as the most dramatic, was entrusted to the most dramatic composer\u2014Cui; Act 4, a mixture of the dramatic and poetic, to Borodin; Acts 2 and 3 were distributed between Mussorgsky and myself. Some portions of Act 2 (folk-wise choruses) were assigned to me; the first half of Act 3 (flight of shadows and appearance of Mlada) was reserved for me; while Mussorgsky undertook the second half\u2014appearance of Chernobog, for which he wanted to utilize his Night on Bald Mountain, heretofore unused.The thought of Mlada and the few sketches I made for it took me away from The Maid of Pskov and the work on The Stone Guest. Cui composed the whole first act of Mlada rather rapidly. Borodin, who had been somewhat disappointed in writing Prince Igor, now took much of the suitable material from it, composed some new music also, and thus wrote almost the whole draft of Act 4. Mussorgsky composed the 'March of the Princes' on a Russian theme (subsequently published separately, with the 'Trio alla Turca'), as well as some other portions of Act 2; he also made suitable changes in his Night on the Bare Mountain and adapted it for Chernobog's appearance in Act 3 of Mlada. On the other hand, my notes of the chorus in Act 2 and the flight of shadows in Act 3 were still uncompleted and nothing would come of them, owing to a certain haziness and indefiniteness in the task of writing music to a scenario insufficiently worked out.Gedeonov's scheme was not destined to be realized. Soon he left the post of Director of the Imperial Theatres and vanished from sight. The Mlada affair dropped into oblivion, and all of us turned to the work we had left for it; whatever we had composed for Mlada found its way into other compositions later.\"\n\nAlthough the music was for the most part completed, the work was never staged. To date there is no published edition that collates the original manuscripts containing all the extant music composed for the Mlada of 1872."

Late in life (1911) he edited and published Act 1 and dedicated it to the memory of Borodin, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov.\n\nMussorgskyMussorgsky contributed four numbers\u2014two borrowed from previous works and two newly composed for Mlada.

The composer had attempted to recycle this piece in Salammb\u00f4 (1866), and planned to do so again in Sorochints\u00ef Fair, thus making it, in four attempts, his most adapted composition.\nThe 'March of the Princes and Priests' (Russian: \u00ab\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0448 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0436\u0440\u0435\u0446\u043e\u0432\u00bb, Marsh knyazey i zhretsov) in Act 2 was later adapted as The Capture of Kars (1880), an occasional piece for orchestra. The main theme of this march was taken from song no. 6 (Russian: \u00ab\u0410 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0433\u0443, \u043b\u0443\u0433\u0443\u00bb, A kak po lugu, lugu) in Miliy Balakirev's Anthology of Russian Folk Songs (1866). This theme was later used by Tchaikovsky as the opening theme of the 4th movement of his Serenade for Strings, Op. 48 (1880). Mussorgsky's march corresponds to Rimsky-Korsakov's dazzling 'Procession of the Princes' (popularly known as the 'Procession of the Nobles') in his later setting of Mlada.\nThe 'Glorification of Chornobog' (Russian: \u00ab\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435 \u0427\u0451\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0433\u0430\u00bb, Slavlenye Chornoboga) in Act 3 was borrowed from the tone poem St. John's Night on the Bare Mountain (1867), and was later adapted as the 'Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad' in Sorochints\u00ef Fair (1880). Among other changes, this revision saw the addition of vocal soloists and chorus to what had previously been a purely orchestral score. The manuscript score of the 'Glorification of Chornobog' is either no longer extant or was reused (with the necessary alternations made) as that of the 'Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad'.BorodinAfter Borodin's death, Rimsky-Korsakov edited and published the Finale from Act 4 as an orchestral concert piece."

It seems to me obviously need to save, but it is not the message I wanted to convey in the song. There is no message elsewhere in the song, simply an observation on love today. Love perverted by the threat of the disease, by the issue of condoms, which arose at the outset that we feel an impetus to another person. Clearly, I say that everyone should take responsibility toward the disease. Everybody is indeed faced with this reality, and I find it sad. Using a condom is not something loose. In the current situation, an appropriate course to guard against the disease seems to go without saying\"."

The Vooruit was founded in Ghent by Edward Anseele and appeared the first time on 31 August 1884, just before the foundation of the Belgian Labour Party (Dutch: Belgische Werklieden Partij) in 1885. \nDe Morgen was modelled on French daily Liberation. The paper is published by De Persgroep which also publishes Het Laatste Nieuws.De Morgen presents itself as an independent and progressive newspaper and a more dynamic alternative to its two competitors in the Flemish market, De Standaard and De Tijd. On the other hand, the paper is described as a leftist and socialistic publication. According to the former editor-in-chief Yves Desmet, the Flemish press was \"de-pillarized\" under the influence of De Morgen.The paper has won several prizes for its revolutionary lay-out. It has applied advanced printing technology to be able to print with greener, water-based ink and higher quality paper."

        "content": "Sonic Lost World is a 2013 platform game developed by Sonic Team. It is part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and was released in October 2013 for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS in PAL regions by Nintendo and by Sega in North America and Japan. A port of the Wii U version for Windows was later released in November 2015.\nLost World focuses on the efforts of Sonic the Hedgehog to stop the Deadly Six, an alien tribe that serves as the game's main antagonists, as they seek to siphon the world's energy from the Lost Hex, the game's setting. Sonic and his long-time sidekick Tails must team up with Doctor Eggman, normally their enemy, to stop the Deadly Six, leading to conflicts among the three parties. While the gameplay is typical of the Sonic series in some ways, it adds parkour mechanics and features largely cylindrical level design with an emphasis on alternate pathways. The game also features the Wisp creatures from Sonic Colors as power-ups.\nThe game began development shortly after the 2010 release of Sonic Colors. It was designed to be streamlined and fluid in movement and design, using tube-like level design and a simple, bright color scheme. The game received mixed reviews upon release; its controls and the Deadly Six were frequently criticized, but its visuals and audio were seen positively. Downloadable content was released both alongside and after the game's release, adding features such as additional levels and a new type of Wisp power."

        "content": "Sonic Lost World is a platform game with action-adventure elements, in which the player controls Sonic the Hedgehog as he travels across the Lost Hex in order to rescue captured animals and stop the Deadly Six. Levels range from side-scrolling 2D levels to fast-moving 3D linear levels to levels taking place on spherical worlds similar to the canceled Sonic X-treme and the Super Mario Galaxy series. This also translates to the 3DS version, as it was the first handheld game in the series presented entirely in 3D.\nThe game uses a new control system which allows players to control Sonic's speed. Simply moving the directional controls will move Sonic at a moderate pace, allowing for more precision. Holding down a trigger button will cause Sonic to sprint, allowing him to move faster and perform new parkour moves, such as running up and along walls and hopping over small ledges. In the air, Sonic can perform a double jump, which returns from Sonic Colors, a homing attack, which can now target multiple enemies in quick succession, and a new kick attack, which can be used to defeat stronger enemies, or knock them into others.\nAlso returning from Colors are the Wisp creatures, which provide short-lived power-ups to Sonic. The Wisps' powers are now controlled using the Wii U GamePad's touchscreen and gyroscopic features. Alongside returning powers such as Drill, Laser and Rocket, new powers include Eagle, which lets Sonic fly through the air, Asteroid, which atomizes objects in his path, and Rhythm, which lets him bounce along a path of notes. There are also some Wisps exclusive to each version of the game. During the game, players can rescue animals by destroying enemies or opening containers, allowing players to progress, or find Red Star Rings that open up circus-themed bonus stages where players can earn more animals. Collecting all the Red Star Rings in the game unlocks the ability to transform into Super Sonic.The Wii U version supports both co-operative multiplayer, in which a second player can control a remote controlled vehicle to assist Sonic, and competitive multiplayer, in which a second player can use the Wii U Gamepad screen to race against the other player. The game also supports Off-TV Play functionality and formerly Miiverse. Using Miiverse, players could exchange items such as Wisps or shields, which would grow more effective if they were used by other players. The 3DS version supports both local and online multiplayer for up to four players. Players may also customise RC vehicles in the 3DS version, which can then be used in the Wii U version."

        "content": "Development for Sonic Lost World started shortly after Sonic Colors was finished, when a few core members started the experimentation for the former and took place over two-and-a-half years. Sonic Team sought to streamline the controls, increase the length, and add more diverse levels compared to previous entries in the series. After reviewing the history of the franchise with Sonic Generations, game producer Takashi Iizuka hoped to \"deliver a new experience\" with Sonic Lost World. Development started on PC, with early experiments involving \"twisted tube-type level[s]\" inspired by Jack and the Beanstalk. As the concept \"was totally new\", early levels had to be remade \"over and over.\" Players were given greater ability to control Sonic's speed in an effort to create a more traditional platforming experience. The parkour mechanic was introduced to maintain a more fluid sense of movement, in contrast to previous Sonic games where running into a wall would force the player to a complete stop. Iizuka stated that \"This game is like going into the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland, an action game where you can experience many strange and fun experiences.\"Development ultimately focused on the Wii U and 3DS because of the success of previous Sonic games on Nintendo platforms. Because Wii U \"has two monitors to use\", Sonic Team decided to include both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The Wii U GamePad's touch screen and gyroscope were employed to activate the returning Color Powers. The 3DS version, co-developed with Dimps, was designed to \"fully utilize\" the 3DS hardware with 3D gameplay and motion controls. Development was harder on 3DS due to its more limited processing power. Iizuka stated that the Color Powers are \"essential\" to the level design of the 3DS version, while they work as an \"additional tool\" in the Wii U version. A simple art style was used to make objects stand out more against the backgrounds, and to keep the game running at a consistent 60 frames per second. The design of the new \"Deadly Six\" villains was based on that of an ogre, and each one's appearance was intended to reflect a certain key characteristic of their personality, which the developers hoped players could see \"just by looking at them.\" The Wii U version of the game was directed by Morio Kishimoto, the director of Sonic Colors and the lead designer of Sonic and the Black Knight, while the 3DS version was directed by Takao Hirabayashi, the director of Sonic Colors DS, and previously lead designer of Sonic Unleashed PS2/Wii.Sega trademarked the title Sonic Lost World in May 2013. The game was revealed on May 17, 2013, in a Nintendo Direct announcement, as part of an exclusive partnership between Sega and Nintendo for the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It is one of three games in this partnership, the other ones being the fourth entry to the Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games series, and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal, a game based on the Sonic Boom animated series. Sega reported that more on the game would be revealed before E3 2013, and that the game would contain both returning and new original characters, both in enemies and friends of Sonic. The first trailer for the game was released on May 28, a day earlier than previously announced. A downloadable demo of the game's first stage was made available for both consoles on October 9 in Japan and in mid-November in North America and Europe. To promote the release of Sonic Lost World, Hardlight released an update for Sonic Dash that includes a boss battle against Zazz, one of the Deadly Six. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U also includes a stage based on Windy Hill Zone from the game.\nThe soundtrack was composed and directed by Tomoya Ohtani, with Takahito Eguchi handling the orchestration and cutscene music. Naofumi Hataya also contributed a single piece, the theme for \"Desert Ruins Zone - Act 3\". A three-disc soundtrack, Sonic Lost World Original Soundtrack Without Boundaries, was released physically in Japan and digitally worldwide via iTunes and Amazon Music on November 27, 2013.A special, limited stock \"Deadly Six\" edition of the Wii U version of the game was available for pre-order, which included special \"Nightmare\" downloadable content (DLC), featuring a new stage and boss battles based on one of Sonic Team's previous games, Nights into Dreams. Clearing the DLC unlocks a special Color Power, the Black Bomb, normally only obtainable via Miiverse. Pre-ordering the game from Amazon.com allowed the player to start off with twenty-five extra lives.A patch for the Wii U version was released on December 10, 2013, adding additional features such as button controls for some Wisps and the traditional extra life reward for collecting 100 rings. On December 18, 2013, Nintendo announced two exclusive pieces of free DLC for the Wii U version based on other Nintendo games. The first DLC stage, \"Yoshi's Island Zone\", was released on the day of the announcement, with a second installment, \"The Legend of Zelda Zone\", released on March 27, 2014. A Windows port was released by Sega Europe on November 1, 2015."

        "content": "Sonic Lost World received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.The game's presentation was well received. Chris Plante (Polygon) praised the Wii U version's visuals and music as \"arguably the best\" in the series. Tim Turi (Game Informer) wrote that \"The orchestrated tracks evoke Mario Galaxy in the best ways.\" Mark Walton (GameSpot) and Chris Scullion (Computer and Video Games) singled out the candy-themed \"Dessert Ruins\" level as a visual highlight. However, Turi made note of \"ultra-compressed\" cutscenes in the 3DS version. Vince Ingenito (IGN) was favorable to the \"pleasant\" art direction and stable framerate, but criticized the \"subdued\" color palette. Roger Hargreaves (Metro) stated that the \"imaginative\" designs and \"spectacular set piece[s]\" kept him \"interested to know what comes next.\" Chris Schilling (Eurogamer) was effusive: \"Blue skies forever!\"Strong criticism was directed at the game's control scheme, especially the new parkour mechanic. Turi \"never got a good feel for the rhythm of wall running and jumping, and felt lucky to pass sections where it was forced.\" Hargreaves, Walton, and Matthew Castle (Official Nintendo Magazine) agreed. Ingenito found it problematic that Sonic tends to wall-run on every nearby vertical surface. Schilling singled out the multi-lock homing attack, writing that while it usually worked \"perfectly well\", it appeared to \"inexplicably fail\" on occasion. Ingenito, Turi, and Hargreaves agreed. Castle struggled with the homing attack \"locking on too late or attacking enemies in awkward sequence.\" However Justin Towell (GamesRadar) defended the control scheme, explaining that while it had a learning curve, it also \"modernize[s] environmental traversal\" and \"provide[s] a distinct safety net\". Towell argued that Sonic was mainly hard to control in 2D because there are \"so many rules for how Sonic reacts contextually to his environment\". Reona Ebihara (Famitsu) stated that the ability to slow down made the game easier to play for beginners. However, Turi criticized Sonic's \"odd sense of momentum\" and imprecise jumps, stating that switching between two speeds is \"jarring\" and produces \"touchy platforming\". Schilling excoriated the \"profoundly frustrating\" controls as the worst in the series, explaining that \"Sonic's too sluggish while walking, and too skittish to cope with the trickier platforming bits when running\". Ingenito agreed: \"I've played a lot of Sonic over the years, and the controls have never felt as alien and inconsistent as they do here.\"Several critics felt that Sonic controlled better on the 3DS. Jose Otero (IGN) said the parkour \"felt great\" and \"turned most obstructions into minor hurdles\" in this version. Joe Skrebels (Official Nintendo Magazine) felt that Sonic \"controls far better at top speed on 3DS\". Stephen Totilo (Kotaku) stated that the 3DS version does a better job of teaching the controls, although Turi derided its \"constant, lengthy tutorial text\". However, Schilling called the homing attack \"even more capricious\" on 3DS.Reaction to the game's level design was mixed. Turi made note of oddly placed invisible springs in the Wii U version's \"confusing\" and \"aggravating\" levels, and expressed frustration with the 3DS version's \"head-scratching\" puzzles. Walton preferred the \"inoffensive\" 2D sections to the \"frustrating mishmash of speed and exploration\" found in 3D. Plante praised the Wii U version's 3D stages as \"wildly creative exercises in platforming experimentation\" while decrying its 2D stages as \"so clunky and tiresome that it's hard to imagine a time when a side-scrolling Sonic was actually good.\" Philip Kollar (Polygon) was harsher on the 3DS version due to its \"confusing and labyrinthine\" level design and \"awkward puzzles\". Ingenito stated that the Wii U version's levels were stuck in \"design gridlock\" and \"lack[ed] rhythm and cohesion\". Otero praised the 3DS version's \"better levels\" as \"competently made race tracks full of alternate pathways\", but called the \"trial and error\" required to complete the \"slower-paced 3D stages\" \"incredibly frustrating\". Castle stated that the Wii U version's \"best stages play to the strengths of Sonic's tiered speed\", while Skrebels felt the 3DS version featured levels well-suited for handheld play. Totilo praised \"the intuitive, flowing, player-friendly levels of the 3DS version\" but panned \"the badly-explained, choppy, punitive levels of the Wii U version\". Schilling wrote that \"I came perilously close to biting my GamePad at one particularly sharp difficulty spike.\" Edge noted that \"Sonic games, and platformers in general, have always been about memorizing the lay of the land, but rarely have mistakes been so costly or heavily punished.\"The alternate gameplay styles polarized many critics. Daniel Cairns (VideoGamer.com) and Castle highlighted the level where Sonic becomes a giant snowball as \"genuinely excellent\" and \"a cool riff on Monkey Ball\", whereas Turi and Ingenito described it as \"atrocious\", \"uncontrollabl[e]\" and \"the exact opposite of fun\".  Turi encountered multiple game overs while playing a mandatory pinball sequence.  Walton felt that some of the Wisps were an \"amusing aside,\" but problematic motion controls and short time limits impaired their utility. Justin Speer (GameTrailers) stated that the Wisps felt out-of-place in the Wii U version. Totilo preferred how the Wisps were implemented in the 3DS version, but Towell stated that while they were \"more integral\" to the design, they tended to interrupt \"the free-form gameplay\" with \"clumsy mechanic[s]\". Towell described the 3DS version's motion-controlled Special Stages as \"borderline unplayable\". Totilo and Castle criticized the Wii U version's Jetpack Joyride-style flying levels as \"regrettable\" and \"horribly imprecise\". Turi and Totilo criticized the Wii U version's balloon-popping minigame as \"mind-numbing\" and \"awkward\". Turi called the Wii U version's co-op mode \"useless\". Castle wrote that \"Two-player races would be a cool addition were it not for the horrible framerate issues.\"The Deadly Six were negatively received. Towell found the personalities of the characters to be enjoyable and stereotypical, but was disappointed by the poor quality of their dialogue.  Speer called the boss battles \"weirdly anticlimactic\", and Ingenito stated they were \"some of the most boring in the series' history\". Turi described the Deadly Six as generic, forgettable, and \"some of the most aggressively annoying villains ever.\" EGM Now  observed that the inclusion of the Deadly Six subverted the familiar Sonic-versus-Dr. Eggman concept, but questioned whether the plot was a clever self-parody or had been \u201cscrawled together by a couple of grade-schoolers\u201d. Critics disagreed over what to make of the game as a whole. In 2015, USgamer referred to Lost World as \"perhaps Sonic's best outing in years.\" Jim Sterling (Destructoid) said it \"can wildly swing from brilliant to horrific at the drop of a hat, but when one steps back and takes a look at the whole production, one sees far more to love than hate.\" Plante noted that \"the early stages display a degree of design ingenuity and polish which gradually degrades\". David McComb (Empire) called it \"A cheap, cruel, crushing disappointment in the wake of Sonic Colors and Generations.\" Walton concluded that \"in overtly coveting the great Italian plumber, it smothers the talents of its blazing blue hedgehog.\""

Conjunctively, the Vibal Foundation (per Gaspar Vibal and his mother) made a historical move in Philippine education, when it also launched on June 12, 2008, the 110th Philippine Declaration of Independence day, e-turo.org, as conduit of these 3 landmark education tools. Tin Mandigma, editor-in-chief of E-turo.org explained that it is an e-learning portal which \"seeks to provide free and quality learning materials online to teachers and students; it gives teachers access to lesson plans and modules based on textbook materials published by Vibal Publishing House, Inc. amid plans to offer Department of Education-approved content from various learning institutions as supplementary teaching materials. One of the most common complaints of teachers is that while the Internet has so much information, most of it cannot be adapted to the local classroom. With this project, we hope to help teachers sort through the clutter and give them quality information that would be useful for their students.\""

        "content": "WikiPilipinas was originally conceived as Wikipiniana, an open content management system for volunteer members of the Philippine online resource Filipiniana.net. The site initially used the Plone content management system the production of articles was deemed too slow under the system. In September 2006, plans to shift the system to use the wiki-model were conceived (after the founding of Filipiniana.net) by its New York-based founder Gaspar Vibal and webmaster Richard Grimaldo. Octogenarian book publisher Esther A. Vibal, founder of Vibal Publishing House, Inc. (VPHI), and mother of Gaspar Vibal learned about online publishing and knowledge sharing. She introduced the concepts through Gaspar's Filipiniana.net and WikiPilipinas.org, the world's biggest Philippine encyclopedia available on the Web.The actual conceptualization of WikiPilipinas (then-Wikipiniana) occurred in February 2007. In planning, MediaWiki was officially selected to be the site's platform and it was decided that the site were to be modeled after the Wikipedia. Instead of a complete fork of Wikipedia however, Wikipiniana was to be a \"hipper\" and \"freer\" version, including almanac lists and directories. The WikiPilipinas team, headed by Grimaldo as webmaster and Alfred Ursua as its managing editor, drew up an initial masterlist of priority contents for Project Wikipiniana.The project officially began on March 15, 2007. It was first made available online three months after on June 12 to coincide with the country's official Independence Day. A month after going live, the official name of the service was changed from Wikipiniana to WikiPilipinas on July 7. WikiPhilippines was the term decided upon for the section of the site with articles in English and WikiFilipinas for the section in Spanish. A press-oriented sneak preview of the site was hosted for the local media on August 22 of the same year. The event was attended by major Philippine media outlets such as GMA-7 and RPN-9, print media like the Manila Bulletin, the Philippine Daily Inquirer, and the Manila Times and dozens of Philippine bloggers. In a press release on August 23, the site's publicists claimed to be \"the fastest online startup in Philippine history\" due to the site receiving 100,000 visitors during the slew of accesses that occurred after the site was covered by the media the previous day.WikiPilipinas had its official launch during the 28th Manila International Book Fair in late August 2007.The project itself is owned by the Vibal Foundation, which bills itself as the \"corporate social arm\" of Vibal Publishing House. It is a sister-project to Filipiniana.net, a Philippine-oriented research portal."

        "content": "WikiPilipinas has been the subject of several articles by major broadsheet newspapers in the Philippines. The service itself has been covered by GMA Network news in segments on two of the station's daily news programs.Many of its observers on the blogging community and Tambayan Philippines, the Philippine Wikipedia regional notice board, have observed that it is \"trying to be everything all at once: magazine, putative encyclopedia, pluralistic community forum, soapbox-for-a-day, rumor rag, fight club. It is a pastische of different entities, each of which has been successful on its own, but it remains to be seen whether they will be as successful when smashed together. It is less an organic fusion as it is an unnatural pile-up of knowledge-sharing methodologies taken from Euro-America. In many ways, it is symptomatic and representative of the Philippine condition.\"Upon learning of its inception, a few Filipino bloggers questioned the usefulness of WikiPilipinas as a fork of Wikipedia. In a post entitled \"Is There Any Point to Wikipiniana?\", a Filipino blogger weighed the pros and cons of having an encyclopedia administered to entirely by Filipinos. Filipino blogger and Wikipedian Eugene Alvin Villar questioned the usefulness and purpose of WikiPilipinas in a blog post on July 19, 2007. He argued that the \"hip and free encyclopedia\"'s policy on articles not needing to adhere to a neutral point of view (as Wikipedia does) was not conducive to an unbiased encyclopedia. With WikiPilipinas being marketed as an encyclopedia \"by Filipinos, for Filipinos,\" Villar pointed out the great possibility of bias in the encyclopedia's articles. Aside from the possibility of bias, he also mentioned that the articles of WikiPilipinas were less likely to rank higher than those of the English Wikipedia in web searches, making effort spent in updating WikiPilipinas articles better spent working on their equivalent Wikipedia articles. He later reiterated some of these concerns in an interview with the Manila Bulletin in September. In the interview, he criticized WikiPilipinas for prioritizing publicity over streamlining the site's policies and guidelines. Notable Filipino blogger Abraham Olandres personally mentioned Villar's criticism of WikiPilipinas. In his post, Olandres agreed that the Filipino-based service would be useless and redundant unless it \"came up with its own set of content\". In a later entry, Olandres pointed out that WikiPilipinas' lack of a notability guideline could possibly slant it towards a Filipino-centric sense of pseudo-notability.Kristine Mandigma, the president of the Philippine literacy advocacy group Read-or-Die Foundation, also made a commentary on WikiPilipinas after attending the service's August 22 official press launch. She described WikiPilipinas as \"the online version of an omnium gatherum\u2026 a motley and captivating assortment of ideas, facts and factoids, emotions, dissertations, and agonized biographies.\"The site's credibility was questioned in line with a possible connection to Vibal Publishing House, a local publishing service that was implicated in a controversial textbook scandal. Both the publishing company and WikiPilipinas are owned by the same person, Gaspar Vibal. In an interview with the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Vibal asserted that the wiki project and the publishing house were independent of each other."

The production of the album was a stressful process; with tensions arising, it led to disagreements that almost split the group, including discouragement from Andrew Vowles. As a demonstration of the project's sound, Del Naja initially produced instrumental demos sampling songs by British post-punk bands such as Wire and Gang of Four, who had been familiar to him as artists he had enjoyed as a teenager. Grant Marshall supported this direction as he wanted to depart from the \"urban soul\" of their previous album, Protection, but Vowles was sceptical.The sessions continued with Vowles and Marshall working on bass and drum loops, while Del Naja continued to produce demos. The album was originally set to be released in December 1997, but was delayed by four months, with Del Naja spending most of the time in the studio \"making tracks, tearing them apart, fucking [sic] them up, panicking, then starting again.\" Before the album's release, the group released \"Superpredators\", a non-album song extensively sampling Siouxsie and the Banshees' song \"Metal Postcard\", for the soundtrack to the 1997 film The Jackal; the track was subsequently included on the Japanese version of Mezzanine.Andrew \"Mushroom\" Vowles left the group soon after the album's release, due to creative conflicts, while reggae artist and Massive Attack collaborator Horace Andy contributed to the album on multiple songs. The album's working title was Damaged Goods, which was the name of Gang of Four's 1978 debut single.\n\nThe cover art depicts a black stag beetle on a white background, photographed by Nick Knight at the Natural History Museum in London."

Musically, the album is a major departure from the jazzy and laidback sound of the first two albums, Blue Lines and Protection, invoking the dark undercurrents which had previously only been vaguely present in the group's music. The album's textured and deep tone relies heavily on abstract and ambient sounds, heavy emphasis on bass, and influences from alternative rock.\nSimilar to their previous albums, several songs use one or more samples, which range from artists typically sampled in trip hop such as Isaac Hayes and various drum breaks, to bands like the Cure and the Velvet Underground. In particular, \"Inertia Creeps\" samples Turkish \u00e7iftetelli music which Del Naja recorded after partying in Istanbul, with his recorded tape subsequently becoming the rhythmic base for the song. In 1998, Manfred Mann sued Massive Attack for unauthorised use of a sample of the song \"Tribute\" from Manfred Mann's Earth Band's eponymous 1972 album, used on \"Black Milk\". The song has subsequently appeared as \"Black Melt\" on later releases and at live performances, with the sample removed. Later digital editions of Mezzanine have retained the original song, with Mann being added to the songwriting credits."

Rolling Stone's Barney Hoskyns, although praising the album, pointed to its flaws: \"Sometimes rhythm and texture are explored at the expense of memorable tunes, and the absence of the bizarre Tricky [...] only highlights the flat, monotonous rapping of the group's 3-D.\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a two-star honorable mention rating and selected \"Risingson\" and \"Man Next Door\" as highlights.John Bush of AllMusic had positive words for the album's song \"Inertia Creeps\", saying it \"could well be the highlight, another feature for just the core threesome. With eerie atmospherics, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen.\"Years after the album was released, it was placed on several best-of lists in the UK and the United States.

Similarly, the mid-tempo \"Te Necesito\" (\"I Need You\") and the upbeat \"Vuelve\" (\"Return\") describe her yearning for a romantic partner to re-enter her life. \"Te Espero Sentada\" (\"I Wait Sitting\") expresses a desire for a romantic partner to be aware of the sorrow his absence brings to Shakira. \"Pies Descalzos, Sue\u00f1os Blancos\" (\"Bare Feet, White Dreams\") suggests that one is happiest when living a carefree lifestyle, while \"Pienso en Ti\" (\"I Think of You\") notes that Shakira thinks more about a lover as times progresses. The penultimate track \"\u00bfD\u00f3nde Est\u00e1s Coraz\u00f3n?\" (\"Where Are You Love?\") asks that her boyfriend comes back to her. The album closes with its eleventh track \"Se Quiere, Se Mata\" (\"You Want, You Kill\"), which tells the story of expectant parents Braulio and Dana, and sees the usage of a harmonica during its chorus."

Nicola is  both a male and female name, depending on cultural norms. \nNicola was a frequently given male personal name among the traditional Italian nobility, and was used often in the Middle Ages. The spelling Nikola is widely used in Slavic language speaking areas, reflecting the transliteration of the Cyrillic spelling \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430. The English form of the same name is Nicholas, with Nicolas common in French and Spanish-speaking countries, and Nicolau in Portuguese-speaking countries.  \nNicola has been used as a female name since at least 1150 (the birth date of Lady Nicola de la Haie) and continues as a contemporary female name in Germany, the British Isles and Scandinavia. Less commonly, the name is spelled \"Nichola\" or \"Nickola\". The female form of Nicola in Italian is Nicoletta.  Other forms of the female name in other languages include Nicole and Nicolette in French, Nikolett or Nikoletta in Hungarian, \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1 or \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 in Greek."

        "content": "Wuxia (\u6b66\u4fe0 [\u00f9.\u0255j\u01ce]), which literally means \"martial arts and chivalry\", is a genre of Chinese fiction concerning the adventures of martial artists in ancient China. Although wuxia is traditionally a form of historical fantasy literature, its popularity has caused it to be adapted for such diverse art forms as Chinese opera, manhua, television dramas, films, and video games. It forms part of popular culture in many Chinese-speaking communities around the world. According to Hong Kong film director, producer, and movie writer Ronny Yu, wuxia movies are not to be confused with martial arts movies.The word \"w\u01d4xi\u00e1\" is a compound composed of the elements w\u01d4 (\u6b66, literally \"martial\", \"military\", or \"armed\") and xi\u00e1 (\u4fe0, literally \"chivalrous\", \"vigilante\" or \"hero\"). A martial artist who follows the code of xia is often referred to as a xi\u00e1k\u00e8 (\u4fe0\u5ba2, literally \"follower of xia\") or y\u00f3uxi\u00e1 (\u904a\u4fe0, literally \"wandering xia\"). In some translations, the martial artist is referred to as a ji\u00e0nxi\u00e1 (\u528d\u4fe0) or ji\u00e0nk\u00e8 (\u528d\u5ba2), either of which can be interpreted as a \"swordsman\" or \"swordswoman\", even though they may not necessarily wield a sword.\nThe heroes in wuxia fiction typically do not serve a lord, wield military power, or belong to the aristocratic class. They often originate from the lower social classes of ancient Chinese society. A code of chivalry usually requires wuxia heroes to right and redress wrongs, fight for righteousness, remove oppressors, and bring retribution for past misdeeds. Chinese xia traditions can be compared to martial codes from other cultures, such as the Japanese samurai bushid\u014d."

        "content": "Modern wuxia stories are largely set in ancient or pre-modern China. The historical setting can range from being quite specific and important to the story, to being vaguely-defined, anachronistic, or mainly for use as a backdrop. Elements of fantasy, such as the use of magic powers and appearance of supernatural beings, are common in some wuxia stories but are not a prerequisite of the wuxia genre. However, the martial arts element is a definite part of a wuxia tale, as the characters must know some form of martial arts. Themes of romance are also strongly featured in some wuxia tales.\nA typical wuxia story features a young male protagonist who experiences a tragedy \u2013 such as the loss of his loved ones \u2013 and goes on to undertake several trials and tribulations to learn several forms of martial arts from various fighters. At the end of the story, he emerges as a powerful fighter whom few can equal. He uses his abilities to follow the code of xia and mends the ills of the jianghu. For instance, the opening chapters of some of Jin Yong's works follow a certain pattern: a tragic event occurs, usually one that costs the lives of the newly introduced characters, and then it sets events into motion that will culminate in the primary action of the story.Other stories use different structures. For instance, the protagonist is denied admission into a martial arts school. He experiences hardships and trains secretly and waits until there is an opportunity for him to show off his skills and surprise those who initially looked down on him. Some stories feature a mature hero with powerful martial arts abilities confronting an equally powerful antagonist as his nemesis. The plot will gradually meander to a final dramatic showdown between the protagonist and his nemesis. These types of stories were prevalent during the era of anti-Qing revolutionaries.Certain stories have unique plots, such as those by Gu Long and Huang Yi. Gu Long's works have an element of mystery and are written like detective stories. The protagonist, usually a formidable martial artist and intelligent problem-solver, embarks on a quest to solve a mystery such as a murder case. Huang Yi's stories are blended with science fiction.\nDespite these genre-blending elements, wuxia is primarily a historical genre of fiction. Notwithstanding this, wuxia writers openly admit that they are unable to capture the entire history of a course of events and instead choose to structure their stories along the pattern of the protagonist's progression from childhood to adulthood instead. The progression may be symbolic rather than literal, as observed in Jin Yong's The Smiling, Proud Wanderer, where Linghu Chong progresses from childish concerns and dalliances into much more adult ones as his unwavering loyalty repeatedly thrusts him into the rocks of betrayal at the hands of his inhumane master."

Extant early wuxia films produced in China include Red Heroine (1929), Woman Warrior White Rose (1929), and Woman Warrior of the Wild River 6: Rumble at Deerhorn Gully (1930), the sixth film in a series. Hua Mu Lan (1939), another surviving film, is considered a representative of the second wave of wuxia films, during the Anti-Japanese War. Films directed by King Hu and produced by the Shaw Brothers Studio featured sophisticated action choreography using wire and trampoline assisted acrobatics combined with sped-up camera techniques. The storylines in the early films were loosely adapted from existing literature.Cheng Pei-pei, Jimmy Wang and Connie Chan are among the better known wuxia movie stars in the 1960s\u201370s, when films made by King Hu and the Shaw Brothers Studio were most prominent. More recent wuxia movie actors and actresses include Jet Li, Brigitte Lin, Michelle Yeoh, Donnie Yen, Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi. Yuen Woo-ping is a choreographer who achieved fame by crafting action-sequences in wuxia films.\nWuxia was introduced to Hollywood studios in 2000 by Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, though influence of the genre was previously seen in the United States in the 1970s television series Kung Fu. Following in Lee's footsteps, Zhang Yimou made Hero, targeted for the international market in 2002, House of Flying Daggers in 2004, Curse of the Golden Flower in 2006 and Shadow in 2018. Western audiences were also introduced to wuxia through Asian television stations in larger cities, which featured miniseries such as Warriors of the Yang Clan and Paradise, often with English subtitles.\nAsh Is Purest White (Chinese: \u6c5f\u6e56\u513f\u5973; 'Sons and Daughters of Jianghu'), a 2018 Chinese drama directed by Jia Zhangke, is a modern film that refers to the underworld interpretation of jianghu. It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival. The story is loosely based on the leader of a gang from Jia Zhangke's childhood, whom he had admired as a role model. Like the rest of Jia's films, it opened to widespread acclaim.\nThere have been Western attempts at the genre, such as the 2008 film The Forbidden Kingdom, which starred Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Michael Angarano; other movies including wuxia elements are the first three in The Matrix film series (1999-2003, the fourth one from 2021 was choreographed by Joshua Grothe) and the Kill Bill films from 2003-2004, all of which were choregraphed by Yuen Woo-ping. Perhaps the most successful example was DreamWorks Animation's media franchise Kung Fu Panda. Created as an earnest, if humorous, emulation by producers who were knowledgeable admirers of the genre, the series has been particularly hailed in China as an excellent contribution to the form. From the 1990s\u20132000s, Hong Kong stars Daniel Wu and Stephen Fung have worked with AMC Networks to bring wuxia to a US television audience with Into the Badlands, which premiered in 2015 and ran for three seasons.In 2013, Keanu Reeves directed and starred as the main antagonist in Man of Tai Chi, with Tiger Chen as a martial artist attending underground fights. The Mulan remake in 2020 was Disney's attempt in making a wuxia movie. In 2021, Marvel's Shang-Chi opens with a wuxia sequence and has action sequences inspired by Jackie Chan."

The Legend of Sword and Fairy, in particular, expanded into a franchise of eight video games, two of which were adapted into the television series Chinese Paladin (2005) and Chinese Paladin 3 (2009). There are also MMORPGs, such as JX Online 3, Heroes of Kung Fu and Age of Wulin, and hack and slash games, such as Bujingai and Heavenly Sword.Games adapted from the works of wuxia writers include Heroes of Jin Yong, an RPG based on characters in Jin Yong's novels; Dragon Oath, an MMORPG inspired by Jin Yong's Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils; and Martial Kingdoms, a strategy game featuring several martial arts schools which commonly appear in wuxia fiction.\nThe wuxia genre continues to be drawn as a pool of inspiration or source material for Chinese video game studios. In June 2022, Tencent's Lightspeed Studio released a demo trailer on Code: To Jin Yong. In the following month, Everstone Studio unveiled Where Winds Meet, a game compared to Ghost of Tsushima and Assassin's Creed. 2023 saw the release of \"Hero's Adventure: Road to Passion\" in November, a wuxia-inspired open world RPG."

It did, however, have minor success on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the United States, where it peaked at number 87. Other than a performance of the song on Soul Train in May 2003, the album received little promotion, which can be attributed to its commercial failure. Due to the commercial failure of its lead single, the girls' first album, The Moment, was shelved a few months later. The group then recorded three songs for The Powerpuff Girls: Power Pop soundtrack, called \"Chemical X\", \"Power of a Female\" and \"Me and My Girls\". A music video for \"Power of the Female\" was released as a promotional single on Cartoon Network in mid-2003.\nIn 2005, the girls began work on another album.

It speaks of the protagonist who is trying to end the relationship, but her partner keeps calling, and will not give up on them.\n\"Oooh\" is the seventh song on the album, and is a more R&B tinted song. It speaks of the protagonist imagining all of the things she could do with her lover, but she is unsure if she is ready. The eighth song on the album is \"Chick Like Me\". The track features Rasheeda on guest vocals, and speaks about how boys want a \"chick like me\". \"Whenever\", the R&B ballad, is the ninth song on the album. It speaks of being there for a significant other when they need you the most. The tenth song on the album is \"Show & Tell\". The mid-tempo track was meant to be a future single, along with \"That Boi\". However, due to the merger between Capitol Records and Virgin Records, all future singles were canceled, leaving the track unreleased. \"Fool 4 You\" is a soft R&B track that speaks of the protagonist not being able to get over her past relationship. The last song on the album is the ballad \"Moment In Time\". It speaks of a couple who is on the verge of breaking up. The protagonist speaks of how she cannot go on without him."

        "content": "Mark Edwards Nero, of about.com praised the album, stating, \"They might not exactly be the new Destiny's Child, but the four members of Cherish definitely show a lot of promise on their debut album. Fans of snap music, pop-R&B and/or dance club jams should be happy with the upbeat, youthful exuberance displayed throughout Unappreciated.\" Nero praised the album for its \"youthful energy\", as well as its \"soulful bounce\". He also commented that he enjoyed the \"mature, meaningful lyrics\". However, Nero did criticize \"the girls' shallow vocal range\" as well as the \"lack of distinction between the girls' voices\". A reviewer for \"somekindaoh\" commented on the album, stating, \"Cherish may not be the 2nd coming of any infamous girl group from the past but this actually works in their favor. The lack of pressure from comparisons will give them ample room to breathe and time to live up to the potential exhibited on this debut. They already know how to write a good lyric and construct a good melody. And once they learn the art of arranging a good vocal is to make it the heart of the song rather than just simply a element in it, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll find themselves appreciated on a much larger scale.\"Andy Kellman of AllMusic gave the album a mixed review, stating, \"Though they're still in their late teens and early twenties, they write a lot of their lyrics, and they sound as sure of themselves on Unappreciated as any R&B group with a handful of albums behind them. However, it's clear that they're very much under the influence of their inspirations and contemporaries (from Destiny's Child to Ciara) and aren't yet able to distinguish themselves from what they've absorbed as music fans. Unappreciated is a boilerplate R&B album that's pleasant and likeable, yet it doesn't leave much of an impression and lacks character. Lead single \"Do It to It\", produced by Don Vito and Cheese, is emblematic in that it's the best track on the album and bears a tremendous resemblance to Ciara's Jazze Pha-produced hits (all the way down to its cadence).\" Michael Endelman of Entertainment Weekly said of the album, \"This month's model is Cherish, a cheery female foursome that blends the rapid call-and-response vocals of Destiny's Child with the slithery club grooves of Ciara. The mix works, creating a debut that matches of-the-moment beats with sticky melodies. The best cut on Unappreciated is the Don Vito-produced single \"Do It to It,\" which gives the Southern micro-genre known as snap music (think D4L's Laffy Taffy) a Top 40 makeover with a slinky percolating beat and a sweetly cooing chorus.\" He ended the review by giving the album a \"B\" rating."

Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Danmarks Radio (DR), the contest was held at Tivolis Koncertsal on 21 March 1964, and was hosted by Danish TV presenter Lotte W\u00e6ver.\nSixteen countries participated in the contest. Portugal made its debut this year, whereas Sweden decided not to enter.\nThe winner of the contest was Italy with the song \"Non ho l'et\u00e0\", performed by Gigliola Cinquetti, written by Nicola Salerno and composed by Mario Panzeri. At the age of 16 years and 92 days, Gigliola Cinquetti became the youngest winner of the contest yet; a record she held until 1986. The entry had one of the widest margins of victory ever witnessed in the competition. It garnered almost three times as many points as the second-placed song.\nBesides the 1956 contest, the 1964 contest is the only other one of which there are no surviving video recordings."

Whilst this was going on, television viewers were shown a shot of the scoreboard; once the man was removed the contest went on.The interval act consisted of a ballet dance performance by dancers Solveig \u00d8stergaard, Niels Kehlet, Inge Olafsen and Mette H\u00f8nningen from the Royal Danish Ballet, choreographed by Niels Bj\u00f8rn Larsen, and over the music of the \"Columbine porka mazurka\" and the \"Champagne Galop\" by Hans Christian Lumbye.The immediate response of the Koncertsal audience to the Italian entry was markedly enthusiastic and prolonged and, most unusually for a contest performance, after leaving the stage Gigliola Cinquetti was allowed to return to take a second bow. Her performance was given an unscheduled repeat on British television the following afternoon. In the event, she won the most crushing victory in the history of the contest, with a score almost three times that of her nearest rival, a feat extremely unlikely ever to be beaten under the post-1974 scoring system.\nAn aftershow party was held for the participating delegations at the restaurant Ambassadeur in Copenhagen.

Properly, the name means to roil water; and figuratively, it means to disturb, or to afflict. \nIn the Byblos district, the last name Acar developed in the 1820s as a nom-de-guerre given to a rebellious group of Maronite brothers because of their strong resistance against feudalism and tax inequality imposed upon Maronites by Bashir Shihab II. \nAccording to an agreement reached on 17 May 1820, a referendum would be held among the inhabitants of Mount Lebanon regarding leadership of the emirate, as Bashir Shihab II had been deposed. Before the referendum could be held, however, Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali restored Bashir's authority on the condition that he collect an unfair amount of jizya from the Maronites for the Sublime Porte, to which Bashir agreed.\nAmong many other Maronite peasants, the Acar family, and clergymen of Byblos (as well as Maronite peasants and clergymen from Bsharri and Batroun) decided to take up armed resistance against Bashir's impositions, and garnered the support of the Shia Muslim Hamade sheikhs from Keserwan, being land owners in local villages around the Qartaba area, with connections to neighbouring, historically Shia, villages: Mazraat es-Siyad and Lassa. The Maronite peasants proceeded to assemble at Lehfed, Haqil and Ehmej, while Shia villagers assembled at Mishmish. The Acar family settled in the local towns and villages, predominantly: Mazraat es-Siyad, Abboud, Qartaba, and Jinn\u00e9 by the Adonis River. They are a branch of the Salam\u00e9 family, who were historically of the Khoury family, in Chahtoul. \nThere are separate Acar families from Deir el-Qamar (who are a branch of the Nehm\u00e9 family, who were historically of the Daou family), and another in Zahl\u00e9. \nAlthough a nickname registered in the recent history of Lebanon, the history of Acar dates back to the Bible's Old Testament, and is Anglicized as Achar and Achan (biblical figure). In the Bible, this is the name of an Israelite who stole forbidden items during the assault on Jericho, for which he and his family were stoned to death (Book of Genesis 36:27, and in Books of Chronicles 1:42 he is called Jaakan).\nThe word Acar may be the origin of the Greek word 'achos' (\"woe\" or \"pain\"). Therefore, the Greek name Achaeus, and the name of the Ancient Greek mythological hero Achilles may find an origin in the Aramaic Acar.\nNotable people of Lebanese origin with the last name include:\n\nJacques F. Acar (1931-2020), French doctor and microbiologist who specialized in antibiotics.\nJoseph Acar, first Lebanese aviator to fly across the Atlantic.\nEdward J. Akar, Sierra Leonean Deputy Finance Minister, economist, and lawyer.\nJohn Akar (1927\u20131975), Sierra Leonean entertainer, writer, and diplomat."

After the release of Altocolony no Teiri, Noda felt too cautious in writing lyrics, due to the perfection he had striven for in Altocolony no Teiri. In Summer 2010, the album had begun to take shape, with most of the songs in a completed state. Noda felt that the album was free from many of the constraints in the band's previous work, and that it was a high-energy album. He experimented with  hip-hop in \"G-k\u014di\" and jazz-style piano in \"Pi\".All of the songs on the album are sung entirely in Japanese, except for a brief English phrase in \"G-k\u014di.\" This is very different from the band's past albums, which generally feature a few entirely English language songs, and many with large sections sung in English."

        "content": "While Dave Gahan was still busy with his solo album Hourglass (2007), Martin Gore was in his home studio in Santa Barbara, California, working on new songs. In May 2008, the band went to the studio to record their twelfth studio album. Ben Hillier took the production reins again, because the band were so satisfied with their previous collaboration on Playing the Angel (2005). As with their previous album Playing the Angel, Gahan once again wrote three songs with Christian Eigner and Andrew Phillpott: \"Hole to Feed\", \"Come Back\", and \"Miles Away/The Truth Is\". Gore shares lead vocal duties with Gahan on \"In Chains\", \"Hole to Feed\", \"Peace\", and \"Little Soul\". The band described the time in the studio as very productive, a total of 22 songs were created and it was difficult to choose the right songs for the album. Five of the songs not used on the album were released as part of the deluxe box set. Short video clips of the band and production team at work in the studio were regularly posted on the band's homepage. This would be the first time that the band would openly post detailed clips of their recording process on social media.\nLyrically, this album has a good amount of personal lyrics. Gahan explained that the song \"Hole to Feed\" was written about the desire to fill a metaphorical hole but not knowing what to fill it up with. The song \"Wrong\" was described by Gore to have a bit of black humor in its lyrics but doesn't want people to find it depressing. Gore believed that \"Peace\" is one of the best songs he had ever written. Even though the track \"Miles Away/The Truth Is\" is not inherently about drugs, Gahan feels like that subject is always present in his songs due to his past substance abuse.Musically, the album has a heavy use of analog synthesizers giving it a more traditional electronic sound. The opening track \"In Chains\" opens with synthesizers tuning up. \"Wrong\" was chosen to be the first single off the album since the band felt it sounded very different. Gahan described the track as having R&B influences while also being a rant. Gahan explained that \"Come Back\" was going to sound more gospel but the band decided to make it into a wall of sound."

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 70, based on 28 reviews. Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt stated that on Sounds of the Universe, Depeche Mode \"still sound genuinely inspired\" and Ned Raggett of AllMusic concluded, \"Sounds of the Universe is a grower, relying on a few listens to fully take effect, but when it does, it shows Depeche Mode are still able to combine pop-hook accessibility and their own take on 'roots' music for an electronic age with sonic experimentation and recombination.\" Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph noted that the album \"shows up the imaginative constraints of most guitar-based rock.\"However, Rolling Stone critic Melissa Maerz felt that \"the result sounds like a time machine back to the Eighties\", adding that \"Depeche Mode should be poised for a comeback, but it's too soon to unpack those black turtlenecks.\" Bill Stewart of PopMatters wrote that Depeche Mode \"tempt us with a strong first half and then dump us in a collection of tossed off b-sides.\" Jon Caramanica wrote for The New York Times that while the album \"lacks the fragility of 1984's Some Great Reward or the earned attitude of 1990's Violator, it's unmistakably an attempt at revisiting the past, admirable either as an act of defiant stubbornness or tenacious commitment\", but also opined that \"even at its most imaginative, this is seamless Depeche Mode filler, music that could be made by any number of acolytes.\"Sounds of the Universe debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 30,537 copies\u2014the band's highest-peaking album since chart-topping Ultra (1997).

The song captured a musical style that Dion would utilize in the future: sweeping, classical and soft rock influenced ballads with soft instrumentation. Both a critical and commercial smash, the song became her second United States top 10 hit, and also won many awards. As with Dion's earlier releases, the album had an overtone of love.\nDion worked with a new team of writers and producers on her eponymous album. Five songs were written by Diane Warren. \"With This Tear\" was a gift from Prince who wrote the song especially for Dion. The tracks were produced mainly by Walter Afanasieff, Ric Wake and Guy Roche.\nBy 1992, the release of her previous English-language album Unison (1990) and Celine Dion, as well as various media appearances, had propelled Dion to superstardom in North America. She had achieved one of her main objectives: wedging her way into the anglophone market and establishing fame. Apart from her rising success, there were also changes in Dion's personal life, as Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil would make the transition from manager to lover. However, the relationship was kept a secret as both feared that the public would find the twenty-six-year difference between their ages incongruous.\nThe European version of Celine Dion includes \"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\" as a bonus track. The album was re-released on 7 September 1992 in Australia with a bonus disc containing four songs which had been previously released as singles from Unison.\n\"Send Me a Lover\" was a \"leftover\" from the recording sessions of the Celine Dion album and it was released in 1994 on the charity compilation Kumbaya Album 1994.\nTo support it, Dion toured as the opening act for Michael Bolton on his \"Time, Love and Tenderness Tour\" in the summer of 1992 through the United States. From August 1992 till March 1993, she toured Canada with her Celine Dion in Concert tour."

Music critic Robert Christgau called it the \"worst album of the year\u2014that I can remember\". Jan DeKnock of Chicago Tribune said that the album \"is even better, because the young singer-only 24-has developed enough confidence in her second language to really deliver the emotional nuances of a lyric, especially in the ballads that dominate this album.

She says she's a habit of fantasizing situations and making stories. She agrees to go with Alexey to Moscow, but insists that she'd pay for her ticket. Alexey starts loving her and believes she loves him too. He wants her to meet with his close friend Petyunya (Petya), who joins them after a while. Olya confesses to Petya that she's not made up her mind to go to Moscow with Alexey, and that she finds him more mature than Alexey. As she becomes friendly with Petya too, Alexey becomes jealous and asks Petya to not spoil their relationship. But Petya declines and tells him that she is more suitable for him. Soon they end up in a fist fight over a petty matter related to Olya, and she mediates to stop the fight. After a patch up, they continue walking, chatting and friendly banter. As they huddle in a shelter, Olya says it was a great luck that they met. She fantasizes that they are in an adventure novel, tells Alexey that he's a hero, he & Petya are real friends, and kisses him. She tells Petya that she's proud that a strong man like him paid attention to her and he'd win if he's serious. She appears to be enticing both of them.\nThen she takes them to a bowling alley where Vsevolod, her fianc\u00e9, is waiting for them. As she goes to change out of her wet clothes, Alexey & Petya are shocked to learn that Olya is going to marry Vsevolod in a week, and that she'd spent the time with them to prove that she can walk all day without sitting down and win her bet. Alexey tells Vsevolod that besides the bet, he could't even imagine how much he'd lost, and it's too late to explain what that means. Olya rejoins them and confirms that all she did was only to win her bet. Alexey & Petya can't believe she was making a practical joke all day, her behavior & feelings were not for real. Obviously, they are deeply hurt. However, as they leave, she tries to explain that she didn't lie and was honest with them. She tries to follow them, but Vsevolod stops her and tries to console her. She's realized that she's deceived them and suddenly she runs for the door."

        "content": "The lyrics of \"Mother\" address both of Lennon's parents, each of whom abandoned him in his childhood. His father, Alf, left the family when John was an infant. His mother, Julia, did not live with her son, although they had a good relationship; she was hit and killed in a car accident on 15 July 1958 by an off-duty policeman named Eric Clague, when Lennon was 17. In one of his last concerts, Lennon stated that the song was not just about his parents, but was rather \"about 99% of the parents, alive or half dead\".\"Mother\" opens the album, starting with a funeral bell tolling slowly, four times. The song ends with Lennon repeating the phrase \"Mama don't go, daddy come home\", each time increasing in intensity until he screams the line as the song fades out.Lennon was inspired to write the song after undergoing primal therapy with Arthur Janov, originally at his home at Tittenhurst Park and then at the Primal Institute, California, where he remained for four months. Lennon, who eventually derided Janov, initially described the therapy as \"something more important to me than The Beatles\".Although Lennon said that \"Mother\" was the song that \"seemed to catch in my head,\" he had doubts about its commercial appeal and he considered issuing \"Love\" as a single instead. In November 1982, a remixed version of \"Love\" was released as a single to help promote The John Lennon Collection LP.An early version of \"Mother\" performed on an electric guitar by Lennon can be heard on the John Lennon Anthology box set.The unused take 91 of the song was featured in the final scene and credits of the 2009 John Lennon biographical film, Nowhere Boy.A live version of the song was released Live in New York City from his 30 August 1972 concert at Madison Square Garden."

The screaming, unanswered fade out makes the answer only too clear.\" Far Out critic Joe Taysom described it as \"one of the most moving creations that the late musician ever concocted,\" saying that Lennon \"lays himself emotionally bare and finally deals with the abandonment issues that scarred him from childhood.\""

        "content": "Seili is the second studio album by Finnish pop singer Jenni Vartiainen. It was released by Warner Music Finland digitally on 31 March 2010, with the official physical release following on 14 April. From 31 March to the official physical release date, the album was sold at \u20ac19 in conjunction with Ilta-Sanomat. The album was re-released on 14 January 2011, in a limited vinyl edition. The Finnish-language album, incorporating electro and synthpop elements along with melancholic piano ballads, is named after the island Seili (Sj\u00e4l\u00f6 in Swedish), located off the south-west coast of Finland. The album was produced and co-written by Jukka Immonen with Vartiainen writing also two of the songs. The main lyricists were Teemu Brunila and Mariska who contributed to the thematical dualism of the album\u2014Brunila wrote the happier songs about publicity and finding love while Mariska wrote the lyrics for the songs that deal with darker and more serious themes, such as death. Another lyricist was Paula Vesala (from the pop rock duo PMMP). Vartiainen participated more in the production than with her debut album Ihmisten edess\u00e4, by playing for example piano and kantele.\nCritically acclaimed for its vocals and successful combination of ballads and pop, though criticized for lack of peculiarity and a somewhat inconsistent song selection, Seili spent 62 non-consecutive weeks on the Finnish Albums Chart since its release\u2014with 15 weeks atop the chart\u2014and sold over 95,000 copies in 2010, becoming the best-selling album of 2010 in Finland. Altogether, Seili has sold over 150,000 copies since its release and currently ranks 14th in the list of the best-selling albums of all time in Finland. The album received three Emma Awards in February 2011: for Album of the Year, Pop/Rock Album of the Year and Best-Selling Album of the Year. The album included also two Emma-winning songs, the gold-selling singles \"En haluu kuolla t\u00e4n\u00e4 y\u00f6n\u00e4\" and \"Miss\u00e4 muruseni on\", winning in the categories Song of the Year and Music Video of the Year, respectively. \"Nettiin\" was released as the third single and the album spawned two promotional singles, \"Duran Duran\", which sold also gold, and \"Eik\u00f6 kukaan voi meit\u00e4 pelastaa?\". \"Miss\u00e4 muruseni on\" was the major chart hit, dominating the top-three spots of the Finnish Singles Chart from August 2010 to January 2011 and becoming the third-best-selling single of 2011 in Finland. To promote the album, Vartiainen embarked on a concert tour titled Seili, spanning from April 2010 to August 2011 and consisting of 170 shows."

        "content": "Thematically more polarized than its predecessor Ihmisten edess\u00e4, Seili has been described as being based on contrasts as it deals with both darker and happier themes and combines elements of classical music with pop and schlager melodies with rock. Vartiainen has said the overall inspiration for the album came from the imagery of the movie Blade Runner and songs from the 1980s she used in her programs during her figure skating career. The name of the album symbolizes \"a trip to an unknown island, an escape from normal life to the world of music\" and the content of the album places \"during the dramatical moments between 3 am and 5 am\" when a day ends a new one begins and people are, as Vartiainen has put it, \"sensitive to new ideas\", due to either fatigue or intoxication. Vartiainen attributes the dualistic nature of the album to her professional relation with the lyricists Mariska and Teemu Brunila, who Vartiainen is also friends with, saying \"Mariska knows well Vartiainen's darker, more philosophical side\". In an interview with Dome.fi in March 2010, Vartiainen said that while Mariska represents the dark and serious themes such as death, Brunila with his lyrical products \"goes towards the light\" and that the point in the album is \"to reflect on life and death\". Along with the two thematical polarities, the album deals also with tricky relationships and hunger for fame, as showcased by the Western-sounding \"Nettiin\", which starts with a banjo and a bass and is literally about naked pictures, taken and publicized by an ex-boyfriend, and paratextually about the line between privacy and publicity.The album introduces also more instruments than Ihmisten edess\u00e4; Vartiainen starts the album by playing piano in the dark introitus \"Koti\" (Home). The second song \"Seili\" is also dark-themed\u2014the song is about the namesake island located in the archipelago off the coast of Turku where leprotic and mentally ill patients were sent from 17th century onwards, along with boards they could build their own coffins with. The third song and the lead single \"En haluu kuolla t\u00e4n\u00e4 y\u00f6n\u00e4\"\u2014in English, I Don't Wanna Die Tonight\u2014goes on with the theme, though with an electronic dance beat that \"emphasizes the will to live\". The fifth song and the third single \"Miss\u00e4 muruseni on\" (Where My Sweetheart Is) was written by Mariska who got the inspiration for the song while reading Indian erotic literature on her balcony on a hot summer's day. The song is a ballad where the singer talks about being far away from her loved one and asks the wind to blow to the place \"where [one's] sweetheart is\"\u2014by November 2010, the lyrics had even found their way to Finnish obituaries and gravestones. The sixth, dance-influenced song and first promotional single \"Duran Duran\" is about discovering one's soulmate as the lyrics wonder whether \"this is how it feels like when you find the right one\" along with saying \"Jenni can't escape this new feeling\". Vartiainen entered new musical territories also by playing piano and kantele in the song \"Kiitt\u00e4m\u00e4t\u00f6n\" (Ungrateful), which is written by Vartiainen and Paula Vesala and deals with agony Vartiainen suffered from while growing up during high school."

        "content": "Seili has received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Most of the reviewers have been appreciative of the vocals and the successful combination of synthpop and darker ballads, but more or less critical with the notable contrast between the thumping pop song \"Nettiin\" and the rest of the album and Vartiainen's lack of peculiarity. Teemu Fiilin of the magazine Rumba gave Seili three out of five stars, saying that \"Seili follows pretty much the schlager-ish pattern of a poet girl's inflated electro-pop\". He complimented \"En haluu kuolla t\u00e4n\u00e4 y\u00f6n\u00e4\" as \"a brilliant pop song, suitable to be sung by a [then] 27-year-old Jenni Vartiainen who is enjoying her life\". Due to the accompaniment of the more poetical, dramatical and mature songs written by Mariska, Fiilin considered \"Nettiin\" \"a really epic fail\" that \"would be a lot of fun if performed by Tea Hiilloste on Kids Top 20\". He thought \"Duran Duran\" is also brilliant, but considered Vartiainen to be more talented with faster songs, because she, when singing melancholic songs, \"lags kilometers behind [singer] Chisu\". The pop rock magazine Stara said the album is not as good at first hearing as Vartiainen's debut Ihmisten edess\u00e4, but it gave the album four out five stars. The magazine complimented the aggregate of \"En haluu kuolla t\u00e4n\u00e4 y\u00f6n\u00e4\" and the beauty and elegance of \"Duran Duran\". Stara was less harsh on reviewing the inclusion of \"Nettiin\", saying the Western-themed sounds seem a bit odd, but that the song is good in its entirety.Helsingin Sanomat gave the song three out of five stars, saying the album is suitable but that \"Vartiainen does not stand out at all with the song selections and singing voice, as Chisu does\". MTV3 gave the song four and a half stars out of five, criticizing the inclusion of \"Nettiin\" for the sake of consistency and saying none of the songs are particularly catchy. However, MTV3 complimented \"Kiitt\u00e4m\u00e4t\u00f6n\", \"Duran Duran\" and \"Eik\u00f6 kukaan voi meit\u00e4 pelastaa?\" for their massive sounds and considered Seili a brilliant summer album. Writing for the rock magazine Soundi, Antti Luukkanen gave Seili three out of five stars, saying songwriters Teemu Brunila and Mariska and producer Jukka Immonen \"gain credibility for putting the dark piano ballads and the thumping pop songs into balance, creating a coherent and compact entirety\". The magazine said Vartiainen's singing voice \"saves the album\", though it regarded many of the songs as \"hypocritical\" or even \"tasteless\" (such as \"Nettiin\"). Keskisuomalainen deemed the album's rating as four stars out of five. The newspaper considered Seili \"a splendid entirety that, however, lacks that one, ingenious song that stands out from the others\", saying also that the record\u2014the name of which comes from the island where leprotic patients and the mentally ill were sent from the 17th century onwards\u2014is \"elaborate pop that deals with the most fundamental questions\". In conclusion, Keskisuomalainen said that the album is \"a successful combination of introverted ethereality, light-hearted pop and dramatical thunder\"."

The single sold gold with over 18,000 copies and was the third-best-selling single of 2011 in Finland and its music video, depicting a woman looking to the sea and singing about her yearning for her loved one, won the 2011 Emma Award for the Music Video of the Year. In 2010, the song was also the second-most-played song on the radio stations of the Finnish Broadcasting Company, the fifth-most-played on commercial radio stations and it was chosen the Finnish schlager of 2010 in a contest held by the radio station Iskelm\u00e4. On 13 December the first promotional single \"Duran Duran\" was released. Similar to \"Nettiin\" in its chart success, the song charted for 11 weeks, peaking at number 10 in February 2011, but sold gold with 5,400 copies. The song \"Eik\u00f6 kukaan voi meit\u00e4 pelastaa?\" was released as the second promotional single in the spring of 2011 and its music video was released on 14 June."

In the song, the voice heard on the chorus of the song which repeats \"It's beyond my control\" is in fact a sample of John Malkovich's voice from the film \"Dangerous Liaisons\" by Stephen Frears.For the first time throughout Farmer's career, a CD single was released among the various formats. At the time of the song's release, the radio NRJ prepared a 7\" maxi with a collector picture disc in a limited edition (50 units) and containing a new remix.The song deals with self-control, love, death and the betrayal of the beloved man. Farmer tells her own story from the Valmont's sentence (\"it's beyond my control\"): that of a woman who kills her unfaithful lover after a night of love."

        "content": "The video was directed by Laurent Boutonnat who also wrote the screenplay based on the book \"Les Liaisons dangereuses\", by Choderlos de Laclos. It was his last video for Farmer before that of \"Les Mots\", nine years after. The video was shot for two days at Studio Sets in Stains (where the video of \"Plus grandir\" was already shot in 1985) and cost about only 45,000 euros (the budget was limited because the film Giorgino was in preparation). This Requiem Publishing and Heathcliff SA production features Farmer, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lagache, who was the puppeteer in the video of \"Sans contrefa\u00e7on\" and who there plays her flighty lover, and Christophe Danchaud, a dancer of Farmer's tours, who replaces this one for the bare scenes. Photographer Marianne Rosensthiel who witnessed the shooting of the video, said that the white dress worn by Farmer was custom made by a seamstress.In the video, Farmer, tied on an ignited pyre, tries to struggle. Then she kisses for a long time her lover in torrid scenes, and then, wearing a long and wide dress, she walks on embers, with hands full of blood, while singing. These three scenes continue to intersecting until the end of the video. Then Farmer enters a home and surprises her lover making love with a fair-haired woman. The scenes are very erotic. Farmer bites her lover in the shoulder and some blood trickles along his back; they kiss and some blood flows from their mouths. Two wolves voraciously tear apart the body of a dead man.The video, with many explicit scenes of sex and violence, was censored from its release, making a great to-do in the mass media which published many controversial images. Polydor proposed to French television host Michel Drucker to broadcast in first the video on his show Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es on France 2, but he categorically refused, M6 decided to bill it in full version only after midnight although the Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel did not prohibit it, Canal + agreed to broadcast it in the show Top 50, where the programmer confessed she did not find the video so shocking; and for the channel MCM, it asked advice of its television viewers who had voted for or against. Many journalists from various newspapers expressed concerns about the video and French magazine Star Music even qualified it as a \"crap\". This video was often seen by the general public as a pretext for showing salacious images. However, biographer Bernard Violet believes that the video marked the end of an era in Farmer's career, the era of very sophisticated scenarios, to put more highlight the song. Thus, the video has a narrative framework reduced to its bigger simplicity with short and stripped plans. According to journalist Caroline Beet, the bloody kissing between Farmer and her lover clearly refers to a cannibalistic belief that led primitive people to eat their enemies to feed on their strength. About this video, Farmer explained that she liked the blood and nudity and that her relationships with men were at the time very difficult."

        "content": "On 21 February 2012, five members of the group staged a performance on the soleas of Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior. Their actions were stopped by church security officials. By evening, they had turned it into a music video entitled \"Punk Prayer \u2013 Mother of God, Chase Putin Away!\". The women said their protest was directed at the Orthodox Church leader's support for Putin during his election campaign.\nOn 3 March, two of the group members, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, were arrested and charged with hooliganism. A third member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was arrested on 16 March. Denied bail, they were held in custody until their trial began in late July. On 17 August, the three members were convicted of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred, and each was sentenced to two years imprisonment. Two other members of the group, who escaped arrest after February's protest, reportedly left Russia fearing prosecution. On 10 October, following an appeal, Samutsevich was freed on probation, her sentence suspended. The sentences of the other two women were upheld. In late October, Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova were separated and sent to prison.The trial and sentence attracted considerable criticism, particularly in the West. The case was adopted by human rights groups including Amnesty International, which designated the women prisoners of conscience, and by a wide range of musicians including Madonna, Sting, and Yoko Ono. Public opinion in Russia was generally less sympathetic towards the women. Putin stated that the band had \"undermined the moral foundations\" of the nation and \"got what they asked for\".Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said he did not think the three members of Pussy Riot should have been sent to jail, but stressed that the release of the remaining two imprisoned members was a matter for the courts."

        "content": "In an effort to capitalise on the recent UK chart success of their eponymous debut album, Black Sabbath returned to the studio with producer Rodger Bain in June 1970, just four months after the album was released. Paranoid was recorded at Regent Sound Studios and Island Studios in London, England.The album's title track was written as an afterthought. As drummer Bill Ward explains: \"We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony [Iommi] just played the guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom.\" In the liner notes to the 1998 live album Reunion, bassist Geezer Butler recounts to Phil Alexander that they wrote the song \"in five minutes, then I sat down and wrote the lyrics as quickly as I could. It was all done in about two hours.\" According to Alexander, \"Paranoid\" \"crystallized the band's writing process, with Iommi initiating the ideas with his charred riffs, Ozzy [Osbourne] working on a melody, Geezer providing drive and the majority of the lyrics, and Bill Ward locking into a set of often pounding rhythms beneath Butler's bass rumble.\" The single was released in August 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit.Most of the songs on Paranoid evolved during onstage improvisational jams. In the Classic Albums documentary on the making of Paranoid, guitarist Tony Iommi recalls that \"War Pigs\" came from \"one of the clubs\" with Butler adding, \"During the song \"Warning\" we used to jam that out and that particular night when we were jamming it out Tony just went da-dum!\" In the same documentary, Iommi demonstrates his approach to the guitar solo in the song, explaining that \"I always tried to keep the bottom string ringing so it fills it out nicely.\" On \"Planet Caravan\", Osbourne sings through a Leslie speaker, with the singer telling Mojo in 2010, \"Then Rodger Bain used an oscillator on it \u2013 whatever that is. It looks like a fridge with a knob on.\""

        "content": "The album's opening track \"War Pigs\" was originally intended to be called \"Walpurgis\". It was then changed to \"War Pigs\", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that the song of the same name had potential as a single. Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: \"I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' \u2013 you know, the Satanic version of Christmas \u2013 write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not going to call it that. Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'.\" In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, \"It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis' ... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't interested in your average 'I love you' pop song ... Geezer also liked to put a lot of topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had his ear to the ground, Geezer did.\"\nThe song \"Iron Man\" was originally entitled \"Iron Bloke\". Upon hearing Iommi play the main guitar riff for the first time, Osbourne remarked in awe that it sounded \"like a big iron bloke walking around\". The title was later changed to \"Iron Man\" as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. The riff to \"Iron Man\" is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that \"...Tony Iommi turned out to be one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff \u2013 and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away.\" Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. His attempts to warn the populace are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and vengeful, causing the destruction seen in his vision. \"Electric Funeral\" also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands \"it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life.\"In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne said: \"It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday ... And suddenly, you know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet.'\" \"You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world,\" Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, \"and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that I wanted to talk about \u2013 political stuff \u2013 so that's what inspired me.\"In 2013, Butler told Mojo magazine that the song \"Paranoid\" was \"about depression, because I didn't really know the difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards.\" In 2015, Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: \"I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. I used to get really depressed and it was the only thing that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself.\" According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's \"Communication Breakdown\", with the bassist admitting, \"I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it ... They were our favourite band by that time\".\n\"Planet Caravan\" was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, \"It was almost one of those 'Should we do this?'\" with Butler adding, \"We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever ... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend.\" Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. \"Hand of Doom\" dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was \"nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in my head and when we got to \"Hand of Doom\", that's what I wrote it about\".According to Butler, Ward's drum solo \"Rat Salad\" resulted from the band having to play 8 and 3/4-hour spots a night in Europe early in their career. \"Bill used to fill out a whole 45 minutes doing a drum solo just to get rid of that 45 minutes,\" he revealed to Classic Albums. \"I have no idea where the title came from, though.\" While Butler may have now forgotten where the title of \"Rat Salad\" came from, in 1971 he was on record stating it came from a joke about Ward's hair having not been combed. In 2013, Sabbath biographer Mick Wall described the closing track on the album, \"Fairies Wear Boots\", as a \"hard-driving riff sweetened by a beautifully baleful melody\" with a lyric written by Osbourne about a nasty encounter with a group of skinheads."

        "content": "Paranoid was originally titled War Pigs, but the record company allegedly changed it out of fear of a backlash from supporters of the ongoing Vietnam War. Additionally, the band's label felt the title track was more marketable as a single. Ozzy Osbourne states in I Am Ozzy that the name change had nothing to do with the Vietnam War, and was entirely due to the record company deciding the album would be easier to sell if it was named after the single, which had already had significant success by the time the album was released, reaching number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. It was too late, however, to alter the artwork. Joe Smith, who was executive vice-president at Warner Bros. from 1970 to 1972, told Classic Albums that the rest of Warner Bros. didn't want anything to do with them: \"We were in the midst of the war ourselves in this country and what their reasoning was not that important to me. I knew we weren't going to call it 'War Pigs'.\" Regarding the song \"Paranoid\", Smith recalls, \"It was on an acetate. I remember playing it and turning the sound way up and shaking the whole building ... I said 'I think that's the breakthrough album. I don't understand it but that 'Paranoid' sounds like a great title for an album and a great title for a single.'\" \"That album title had nothing to do with the sleeve,\" Osbourne explained to Phil Alexander in 1998. \"What the fuck does a bloke dressed as a pig with a sword in his hand got to do with being paranoid, I don't know, but they decided to change the album title without changing the artwork.\"The cover, with the original War Pigs title in mind, was designed and shot by Keith McMillan (credited as Keef) in Black Park. His assistant, Roger Brown, was the model. The original UK vinyl release was in a gatefold sleeve featuring a black-and-white photo of the band, posed outdoors on a grassy hill. Also shot by Keith McMillan, it was the band's first appearance on album artwork."

        "content": "The album was issued in the United Kingdom in September 1970, where its sales were enhanced by the success of the \"Paranoid\" single. \"That single attracted screaming kids\", Iommi recalled in the liner notes to Reunion in 1998. \"We saw people dancing when we played it and we decided that we shouldn't do singles for a long while after that to stay true to the fans who'd liked us before we'd become popular.\" Paranoid's US release was delayed until January 1971, as the Black Sabbath album was still on the charts at the time of its UK release. Paranoid reached No. 12 in the US in March 1971 with virtually no radio airplay. From contemporary reviews, an uncredited writer in Disc praised the album, declaring the group's music as \"tight, loud, simple and exciting\" with material based on \"simple, catchy riffs [...] with lyrics that don't put them in the Dylan class.\"In a retrospective review, AllMusic's Steve Huey cited Paranoid as \"one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time\", which \"defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history\". Ben Mitchell from Blender said it was \"the greatest metal album of all time\". According to Rolling Stone's Joe Levy, \"Sabbath ruled for bummed-out kids in the Seventies\" and \"nearly every heavy-metal and extreme rock band of the last three decades\", including Metallica, Nirvana and Slipknot, \"owes a debt of worship\" to Iommi's \"crushing\" guitar riffs, Ward and Butler's \"Visigoth rhythm section\" and Osbourne's \"agonized bray\" on tracks such as \"Paranoid\", \"Iron Man\" and \"War Pigs\". Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), feeling he could not take the band's horror-themed music seriously enough to appreciate it as anything other than \"camp\", noting that the title cut is especially \"screamworthy\". However, he did note that the band does take musical heaviness to \"undreamt-of extremes\".The album is currently ranked at No. 139 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Paranoid's chart success allowed the band to tour the US for the first time in October 1970, which spawned the release of the album's second single \"Iron Man\". Although it failed to reach the top 40, \"Iron Man\" remains one of Black Sabbath's most popular songs, as well as the band's highest charting US single. As of 2014, Paranoid is Black Sabbath's best-selling album, having sold 1.6 million copies in the US since the beginning of the SoundScan era."

        "content": "In 1974, nurse Hillary Pollard from Rawcliffe, North Yorkshire was found dead between a pair of speakers with the Paranoid album on her turntable. She had overdosed on sleeping tablets, with a small enough dosage to make suicide inconclusive. However, the album's possible influence in her potential suicide was still mentioned in the inquest, but ultimately it was decided that Black Sabbath were not to blame for her death. \"A lot of the words in the songs \u2013 a lot of the moods of the songs \u2013 are aggressive,\" Iommi acknowledged. \"Especially in the early days \u2013 Satanic, if you like ... That was the way it felt, so that was the way we played. But it got out of hand. With Paranoid in England, for instance. There was a girl found dead \u2013 a nurse she was: dead in her room with our album on the turntable going round. And it was taken to court saying that it was because of the album that she was depressed and killed herself, which was totally ridiculous, I think.\"In a 1982 interview with The New Music, Butler claimed, \"If the moral majority don't understand it they'll try to put it down, or get other people to read all sorts of things into it ... The moral majority sort of people picked up on the Satanic part of it. I mean, most of it was about stopping wars and that side of it, and some science fiction stuff. There wasn't that much Satanic stuff, and what there was it wasn't exactly for the devil or anything like that; it was just around at the time and we just brought it to people's attention.\" In the documentary The Black Sabbath Story, Vol. 1, Butler expresses his frustration at how fans misinterpreted the band's lyrics, stating that, \"For instance, on 'Hand of Doom' they'll pick up one sentence out of that and blow it up into this big thing, like as if we're telling everyone to go and shoot smack, where the whole song [\u2026] is against drugs.\""

        "content": "In Finland, a person must have a surname and at least one given name with up to three given names permitted. Surnames are inherited either patrilineally or matrilineally, while given names are usually chosen by a person's parents. Finnish names come from a variety of dissimilar traditions that were consolidated only in the early 20th century. The first national act on names came into force in 1921, and it made surnames mandatory. Between 1930 and 1985, the Western Finnish tradition whereby a married woman took her husband's surname was mandatory. Previously in Eastern Finland, this was not necessarily the case. On 1 January 2019, the reformed Act on Forenames and Surnames came into force.Finnish given names are often of Christian origin (e.g., Jukka from Greek Johannes), but Finnish and Swedish origins are also common.\nIn Finnish, the letter \"j\" denotes the approximant [j], as in English you. For example, the two different names Maria and Marja are pronounced nearly identically. The letter \"y\" denotes the vowel [y], not found in English, but similar to German \"\u00fc\" and French \"u\". \"R\" is rolled. The stress is always on the first syllable in Finnish. For example, Yrj\u00f6 K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen is pronounced [\u02c8yrj\u00f8 \u02c8k\u00e6\u02d0ri\u00e6i\u032fnen]. Double letters always stand for a geminate or longer sound (e.g., Marjaana has a stressed short [\u0251] followed by an unstressed long [\u0251\u02d0] and then another unstressed short [\u0251]). As per Finnish phonotactics, both Finnish first names and surnames usually end in vowels, and always in either a vowel or a coronal consonant. This occurs regardless of gender, and surnames are no longer marked by gender.\nPronunciation of Swedish names is similar, but long vowels are not doubled and the stress may be on any syllable. Finland has a long bilingual history and it is not unusual for Finnish speakers to have Swedish surnames or given names. Such names may be pronounced according to Finland\u2013Swedish phonology or, depending on the person named, the person speaking and the language used, a Fennicized variant.\nWhen writing Finnish names without the Finnish alphabet available (such as in e-mail addresses), the letters \"\u00e4\" and \"\u00f6\" are usually replaced with \"a\" and \"o\", respectively (e.g., P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen as Paakkonen). This is not the same, but visually recognizable."

        "content": "Finland has three predominant surname traditions: the West Finnish, the East Finnish and that of the Swedish nobility, clergy, bourgeoisie and military. Until the early 20th century, Finland was a predominantly agrarian society and the names of West Finns were based on their association with a particular area, farm, or homestead (e.g. Jaakko Jussila 'Jaakko from the place of Jussi'). Farm names typically had the suffix -la, -l\u00e4, i.e. \"(place) of\", and could refer to the husband (like Jussila) or describe the location (e.g. Isoaho 'large clearing'). This name could change every time the person moved to a different farm. Multiple names could be recorded in documents, such that for example Pentti Jussila l. Penttil\u00e4 would be a person named Pentti who had moved from Jussila farm to Penttil\u00e4 farm. Also, even if one had a surname, one would still be better known by the farm name. Farm names, patronyms and village names could be used to disambiguate between different people, but they were not true inherited surnames. For example, in Aleksis Kivi's novel Seven Brothers (1870) the character Juhani was officially summoned as Juhani Juhanin-poika Jukola, Toukolan kyl\u00e4st\u00e4, in English 'Juhani, son of Juhani, from Jukola farm, Toukola village'.\nOn the other hand, the East Finnish surname tradition dates back to the 13th century. There, the Savonians pursued slash-and-burn agriculture which necessitated moving several times during a person's lifetime. This in turn required the families to have surnames, which were in wide use among the common folk as early as the 13th century. By the mid-16th century, the East Finnish surnames had become hereditary. Typically, the oldest East Finnish surnames were formed from the first names of the patriarchs of the families (e.g. Ik\u00e4valko, Termonen, Pentik\u00e4inen). In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, new names were most often formed by adding the place name of the former or current place of residence (e.g., Puumalainen < \"of Puumala\"). In the East Finnish tradition, women carried the family name of their fathers in feminine form indicated by the -tar suffix (e.g. Puumalatar < Puumalainen). By the 19th century, this practice fell into disuse due to the influence of Western European surname tradition. Also, women did not change their surnames with marriage.\nIn 1921, surnames became compulsory for all Finns. At this point, if there was no surname, the homestead names were usually adopted as surnames. Because the inhabitants often included farmhands and other non-family member, holders of the same surname are not necessarily genetically related. A typical feature of such names is the addition of prefixes Ala- or Ali- ('Lower') and Yl\u00e4- or Yli- ('Upper'), giving the location of the holding along a waterway in relation to the main holding (e.g. Yli-Ojanper\u00e4, Ala-Verronen). In Pohjanmaa, there are similar prefixes Rinta- and Latva- ('downstream' and 'upstream' respectively).\nCommon suffixes are -nen (in oblique form -se-; e.g., Miettinen : Miettisen \"Miettinen's\"), a diminutive suffix usually meaning \"small\", and -la/-l\u00e4, a locative suffix usually meaning \"(place) of\". The -nen suffix was freely interchanged with -son or -poika as late as the 16th century, but its meaning was ambiguous as it could refer not only to a \"son\", but any member of a patriarch's family, a farm or even a place. For example, the surname Tuomonen could mean \"Son of Tuomo\" or \"Farm of Tuomo\" or something else belonging to Tuomo.\nA third tradition of surnames was introduced into Finland by the Swedish-speaking upper and middle classes which used typical German and Swedish surnames. By custom, all Finnish-speaking people who were able to get a position of some status in urban or learned society, discarded their Finnish name, adopting a Swedish, German or (in case of clergy) a Latin surname. In the case of enlisted soldiers, the new name was given regardless of the wishes of the individual. The oldest noble surnames of Swedish origin were not original, but were derived from the charges in the coat of arms, sigil and flag of the family, for example with Sv\u00e4rd (Swedish: \"sword\"), Kurki/Kurck (Finnish: \"crane\") and Kirves (Finnish: \"axe\").  Families of German origin would use the von suffix (e.g., von Wright).\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the overall modernization process and especially, the political movement of Fennicization brought forth a movement towards the adoption of Finnish surnames. At that time, many people with a Swedish or otherwise foreign surname changed their family name to a Finnish one. The features of nature with endings -o/\u00f6, -nen (Meri\u00f6 < meri \"sea\", Nieminen < niemi \"peninsula\") are typical of the names of this era, as well as more or less direct translations of Swedish names (Helleranta < H\u00e4llstrand). Fennicizing one's name also concealed non-Finnish origin. For example, Martti Ahtisaari's grandfather was Adolfsen from Norway. Nevertheless, Fennicization was not mandatory and thus it is common to find entirely Finnish-speaking families with Swedish surnames; having a Swedish name does not imply one is a Swedish speaker.\nAn effect of industrialization was that large numbers of people moved to the cities and towns and had to adopt a surname. Missing an inherited surname, they invented theirs. Initially, these were in Swedish, and they were not very stable; people called them \"superfluous names\" (liikanimi), and a person could change one's surname several times during their career. Later, Finnish became the preferred language, and themes were taken from nature. Some of the most common examples of this type are Laine \"wave\", Vainio \"cultivated field\", Nurmi \"grassland\", and Salo \"grove\". When applicable, -nen or -la/-l\u00e4 could be suffixed, such as in Koskinen \"rapids + nen\".\nSharing a surname does not imply that the two people are related. Regulation of surnames to prevent two families from sharing the same name only began with the 1921 act. Before this, multiple families could have had Fennicized or otherwise changed their surnames to the same name. For example, the Finnish name Rautavaara was adopted by persons with the former Swedish names Sirius, Rosenqvist, Backman, J\u00e4rnberg, Granlund and Mattson. Similarly, the adoption of farm names as surnames by unrelated persons living on the same farm contributed to the number of these shared names."

        "content": "Patronymics were used in official documents until the late 19th century. Finns did not address each other by patronymics in colloquial speech. The natural Finnish way of referring to someone's parentage is the genitive: Matin Olli (\"Matthew's Olaf\") instead of the solemn Olli Matinpoika (\"Olaf Matthew's son\"). When patronymics were no longer required in documents, they quickly fell out of use. They are still perfectly legal, but very rare, often representing a deliberate archaism. Unlike in Swedish, Finnish patronymics were not transferred into hereditary family names. Thus, the Finnish situation differs considerably from, for instance, Sweden, which has hundreds of thousands of Johanssons and Anderssons. The Swedish patronymic-like surnames are treated like any other surnames. Real patronymics are handled like additional first names, i.e., one must still have a surname. An exception is made for the Icelandic citizens resident in Finland, who are allowed to follow the Icelandic name tradition."

        "content": "The native Finnish tradition of first names was lost during the early Christian period, and by the 16th century, only Christian first names were accepted. The popular names were usually the names of saints whose cult was widespread. This resulted in some differences between the Western and Eastern Finnish first names, as the names in Eastern Finland might have had forms derived from Russian or Church Slavonic, instead of Swedish and Latin. For example, there are two Finnish cognates of George, Yrj\u00f6 < Swedish \u00d6rjan and Jyri < Russian \u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 (Yuri). The most important source for researching the name forms actually used by the Finns themselves in the 15th to 18th centuries are the surnames preserved in written sources, as these were often formed on the basis of a first name. The first names themselves are usually given in Swedish or Latin forms, as these are the languages used in the records. The name actually used was a Fennicized form of the name, which might have changed as the person became older. For example, a person given the Swedish name Gustaf in the parish register might be called Kustu as a child, Kusti as an adolescent, Ky\u00f6sti or K\u00f6pi as an adult and Kustaa as an old man.In the early 19th century, almost all Finnish first names were taken from the official almanac, published by the Royal Academy of Turku, later by the University of Helsinki. The names were mostly names of the saints whose cults had been popular before the Reformation, but the almanac also incorporated a number of names from the Old Testament and Swedish royalty, which were added to certain days during the 17th and 18th centuries. During the 19th century, the Finnish forms were gradually added to the Finnish almanac, while the Swedish and Latin forms were removed (the Swedish forms were retained in a separate Swedish almanac). At the same time, the vicars gradually started to use Finnish name forms in parish registers. This, in turn, cemented the Finnish name forms that were used.\nNames with originally Finnish etymologies were revived in the 19th century. In the absence of reliable information about ancient names, parents chose names of mythical characters from folklore (Aino, Tapio), and many new names were created from Finnish words (Seppo \"smith\" or \"skilled person\", Ritva \"birch twig\"). Some clergymen initially refused to christen babies with such \"pagan\" names. The first given name of Finnish origin, Aino, was accepted in the almanac in 1890, followed by numerous others in 1908. About 30% of Finns born in 1910\u20131939 received a name with Finnish etymology.By the 1930s, the use of Finnish names and name variants was stabilized, and most of the popular names were noted in the almanac. Since then, the almanac has been gradually changed to include new, popular names. At present, all names which have at least 1,000 bearers are incorporated into the almanac of the University of Helsinki and given a \"name day\" (Finnish: nimip\u00e4iv\u00e4). In 2010, 792 of the 35,000 first names used in Finland were listed in the Finnish almanac. The name day calendar follows the Medieval Catholic saints' calendar when applicable.\nFirst names are subject to changing fashions, while second or third given names are more traditional and typically trisyllabic. In the table below, both first and given names are counted. Since the digitalization of the Finnish national population database in the 1970s, the most popular names in Finland (of all Finnish residents or citizens who have lived after that point) have been listed by \nOf the names listed, Annikki and Marjatta are etymologically related to Anna and Maria, but they are characters in the Kalevala, not used as given names before the 19th century."

Strangers are expected to refer to each other by their surnames and using grammar in formal plural. The use of first names indicates familiarity, and children often refer to each other by first names only. However, in many workplaces familiarity between individuals working on the same site is assumed.\nIn contrast to European tradition, the use of titles such as tohtori (\"Doctor\") with surnames is not very common and is found only in highly formal contexts, or it is considered old-fashioned.  The titles equivalent to Mr., Mrs. and Miss are herra, rouva and neiti, respectively. Thus, for example, in formal contexts, Matti Johannes Virtanen can be referred to as herra Virtanen or herra Matti Virtanen, if several Virtanens are present. In most other contexts, simply one name, surname or first name, is used. As in Swedish culture, politeness is often expressed by indirect address, such that the use of names may even be deliberately avoided.

A national final was held to select the song that Sopho would perform. An open call for song submissions was held which resulted in the shortlisting of five entries that were presented to the public during a televised production on 3 March 2007. The results of a public televote exclusively resulted in the selection of \"My Story\" as the Georgian entry, having received 51% of the votes. The song was later retitled for the Eurovision Song Contest and was titled \"Visionary Dream\".\nGeorgia competed in the semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 10 May 2007. Performing during the show in position 6, \"Visionary Dream\" was announced among the top 10 entries of the semi-final and therefore qualified to compete in the final on 12 May. It was later revealed that Georgia placed eighth out of the 28 participating countries in the semi-final with 123 points. In the final, Georgia performed in position 11 and placed twelfth out of the 24 participating countries, scoring 97 points."

A. Finlay, Archbishop Healy, D. Bearne, Rose Kavanagh, John O'Leary and his sister Ellen. These were members of the Irish cultural and nationalistic circles of the time, which included the likes of W. B. Yeats and George Sigerson, and many young writers flocked to the magazine as an outlet for their talents.\nFrom the beginning there were many Protestant contributors, among them Mary Fagan and Frances Wynne. Matthew Russell was impressed by Wynne's poems, and offered to pay for the publication of some; a collection, called Whisper!, was published in 1891.Among the writers \"discovered\" by the Irish Monthly are: Oscar Wilde, M. E. Francis, Katharine Tynan, Hilaire Belloc, Patrick Augustine Sheehan, and Alice Furlong. Gabriel Fallon was a theatre critic from 1926 to 1954.The Irish Monthly ceased publication in 1954."

The magazine was established in 1990, following the invasion of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), and continued publishing up to the genocide. Edited by Hassan Ngeze, the magazine was a response to the RPF-sponsored Kanguka, adopting a similar informal style.  \"Kangura\" was a Rwandan word meaning \"wake others up\", as opposed to \"Kanguka\", which meant \"wake up\".  The journal was based in Gisenyi.\nThe magazine was the print equivalent to the later-established Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM), publishing articles harshly critical of the RPF and of Tutsis generally.  Its sensationalist news was passed by word-of-mouth through the largely illiterate population. Copies of Kangura were read in public meetings and, as the genocide approached, during Interahamwe militia rallies."

Anatole Nsengiyumva and Protais Zigiranyirazo, both later charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  Two language editions were published twice a month in batches of 1,500 to 3,000 copies.  Some of the early editions were published on government printing presses.  Due to the magazine's close ties with the government, it came to be viewed as a vehicle for the government of President Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana to test ideas, though Kangura did not hesitate to criticize the president over perceived concessions made during the negotiations in Arusha with the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). Kangura criticised democracy as sowing discord between Hutu and called for rallying around the MRND.Kangura was key in fomenting extremism and, in turn, became the mouthpiece of the CDR upon its founding in February 1992.  The CDR was an extremist offshoot of the MRND that campaigned for a \"pure Hutu\" nation and prohibited Rwandans with Tutsi grandparents from joining.  While initially formed to give the MRND and Habyarimana deniability for the positions espoused, the CDR soon developed a life of its own.  Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, the Force Commander of UNAMIR, the United Nations peacekeeping force, would later refer to Kangura as \"their [the CDR's] propaganda rag\" and a \"scurrilous extremist newspaper\".The extensive connections of Kangura to the ruling elite appeared to give the magazine inside knowledge.  \"People who might otherwise have ignored [the magazine] paid attention, because Kangura seemed to know what was going to happen before it did,\" stated Kenyan journalist Mary Kimani."

        "content": "An article in the sixth issue, published December 1990, was the first publication of the \"Hutu Ten Commandments\", which decreed that Hutus who interacted with Tutsis were traitors. The propaganda of Kangura targeted women in particular, accusing Tutsi women of seducing Hutu in order to spy on them and mollify them, but only bearing the children of other Tutsi. Another article of December 1990 claimed that the Tutsi were prepared for a war. The back of issue six was a picture of French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand with the caption, \"It is during hard times that one comes to know one's true friends.\"An editorial in the 9 February 1991 issue stated: \"Let us learn about the inkotanyi [RPF supporters] and let us exterminate every last one of them\".  In a November 1991 edition, Ngeze asked \"What tools will we use to defeat the Inyenzi once and for all?\" alongside an image of a machete. The March 1993 issue advised, \"A cockroach gives birth to a cockroach... the history of Rwanda shows us clearly that a Tutsi always stays exactly the same, that he has never changed.\" Kangura further asserted that some who said they were Hutus were in fact Tutsis and that these individuals could be recognized because they \"lacked commitment to the Hutu cause\" and that the RPF had launched its 1990 invasion in order to reestablish the Tutsi monarchy and enslave the Hutus.The writings of founder Ngeze in the journal regularly hinted at exterminations.  In issue 54, of March 1994, Ngeze stated that the RPF had a list of 1600 people who they would kill if they ever took power and warned \"the accomplices of the enemy are well known.  Therefore the Inyenzi should have the courage to understand that they are making a slight error, they shall be exterminated.\"Kangura also implied threats against Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana, especially after its funders moved from the MRND to the CDR.  The December 1993 issue stated that a Hutu soldier enraged by the Arusha Accords would soon assassinate the president.  The January 1994 issue predicted that Habyarimana would be killed in March."

This sparked the genocide. Over 800,000 people were killed, mostly Tutsis but including Hutu moderates  who attempted to protect Tutsi from the militias. \nHassan Ngeze, the founder, editor and accountant for Kangura fled the country as the RPF took control.  He was arrested in 1997 and charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for his involvement with Kangura, as well as for his supervision of massacres in his home province of Gisenyi.  His trial, grouped with that of RTLM co-founders Ferdinand Nahimana and Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, was the first to establish that media organizations could be held responsible for inciting genocide since the 1946 conviction of Nazi publisher Julius Streicher.  In 2003, Ngeze was sentenced to life imprisonment; Nahimana and Barayagwiza were also convicted."

It has two releases each year that follow the semiannual releases of R. At any one time there is a release version, which corresponds to the released version of R, and a development version, which corresponds to the development version of R. Most users will find the release version appropriate for their needs. In addition there are many genome annotation packages available that are mainly, but not solely, oriented towards different types of microarrays.\nWhile computational methods continue to be developed to interpret biological data, the Bioconductor project is an open source software repository that hosts a wide range of statistical tools developed in the R programming environment. Utilizing a rich array of statistical and graphical features in R, many Bioconductor packages have been developed to meet various data analysis needs. The use of these packages provides a basic understanding of the R programming / command language. As a result, R and Bioconductor packages, which have a strong computing background, are used by most biologists who will benefit significantly from their ability to analyze datasets. All these results provide biologists with easy access to the analysis of genomic data without requiring programming expertise.\nThe project was started in the Fall of 2001 and is overseen by the Bioconductor core team, based primarily at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, with other members coming from international institutions."

Each Bioconductor package contains at least one vignette, which is a document that provides a textual, task-oriented description of the package's functionality. These vignettes come in several forms. Many are simple \"How-to\"s that are designed to demonstrate how a particular task can be accomplished with that package's software. Others provide a more thorough overview of the package or might even discuss general issues related to the package. In the future, the Bioconductor project is looking towards providing vignettes that are not specifically tied to a package, but rather are demonstrating more complex concepts. As with all aspects of the Bioconductor project, users are encouraged to participate in this effort.\nStatistical and graphical methods. The Bioconductor project aims to provide access to a wide range of powerful statistical and graphical methods for the analysis of genomic data. Analysis packages are available for: pre-processing Affymetrix and Illumina, cDNA array data; identifying differentially expressed genes; graph theoretical analyses; plotting genomic data. In addition, the R package system itself provides implementations for a broad range of state-of-the-art statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and non-linear modeling, cluster analysis, prediction, resampling, survival analysis, and time series analysis.\nGenome annotation. The Bioconductor project provides software for associating microarray and other genomic data in real time to biological metadata from web databases such as GenBank, LocusLink and PubMed (annotate package). Functions are also provided for incorporating the results of statistical analysis in HTML reports with links to annotation WWW resources. Software tools are available for assembling and processing genomic annotation data, from databases such as GenBank, the Gene Ontology Consortium, LocusLink, UniGene, the UCSC Human Genome Project and others with the AnnotationDbi package. Data packages are distributed to provide mappings between different probe identifiers (e.g. Affy IDs, LocusLink, PubMed). Customized annotation libraries can also be assembled.This project also contain several functions for genomic analysis and phylogenetic (e.g ggtree, phytools packages ..).\nOpen source. The Bioconductor project has a commitment to full open source discipline, with distribution via a SourceForge.net-like platform. All contributions are expected to exist under an open source license such as Artistic 2.0, GPL2, or BSD. There are many different reasons why open-source software is beneficial to the analysis of microarray data and to computational biology in general. The reasons include:\nTo provide full access to algorithms and their implementation\nTo facilitate software improvements through bug fixing and plug-ins\nTo encourage good scientific computing and statistical practice by providing appropriate tools and instruction\nTo provide a workbench of tools that allow researchers to explore and expand the methods used to analyze biological data\nTo ensure that the international scientific community is the owner of the software tools needed to carry out research\nTo lead and encourage commercial support and development of those tools that are successful\nTo promote reproducible research by providing open and accessible tools with which to carry out that research (reproducible research is distinct from independent verification)\nOpen development. Users are encouraged to become developers, either by contributing Bioconductor compliant packages or documentation. Additionally Bioconductor provides a mechanism for linking together different groups with common goals to foster collaboration on software, possibly at the level of shared development."

The Soviet military command suspects hostile intent from Germany and so arranges for its spies to infiltrate ranks of the German military and the SS. Alexander Belov (Lyubshin) is a Soviet spy, who travels from Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic to Nazi Germany under an alias of  Volksdeutsche Johann Weiss. His mastery of the German language, steel nerves and an ability to manipulate others help him to use his connections in the SS to ascend the ladder of the Abwehr and then in the SD. He uses his position to identify sympathetic Germans, who help him to procure vital intelligence, and to help local resistance movements in their collective fight against Nazism."

The title is a combined pun of his family name, Sumner, and a character in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, the summoner. Released in 1993, it explores themes of love and morality in a noticeably upbeat mood compared to his previous release, the introspective The Soul Cages released in 1991 after the loss of both his parents in the 1980s.\nThis album contains two US hits; \"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\" reached No. 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 while \"Fields of Gold\" got to No. 23.Ten Summoner's Tales was shortlisted for the 1993 Mercury Prize. In 1994, it was nominated for six Grammy awards including Album of the Year (losing to Whitney Houston\u2018s The Bodyguard), winning Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance (\"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\") and Best Long Form Music Video, while \"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\" was also nominated for Record and Song of the Year.\nA laser disc and VHS of the album were released, containing live performances of all songs on the album at Lake House.\nA promotional disc was made where Sting discusses some of the songs on the album. There was also an unofficial live album produced during the Ten Summoner's Tales era, entitled Meadowlands of Gold, which contained 13 tracks performed at the Meadowlands Arena on February 26, 1994, in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The songs consisted of tracks from the album, and a few songs by The Police plus a cover of the Beatles' \"A Day in the Life\".\nIn February 2023, it was announced that Ten Summoner's Tales would be re-released and digitally expanded, with multiple songs not previously heard or available to download."

The audio used is partly from the album, but partly recorded as played by the band during the filming. This film was released in conjunction with the album. The video went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Video in 1994, and was directed by Doug Nichol and produced by Julie Fong.\nOn 11 August 1994, a compact disc of Ten Summoner's Tales became the first item ever securely purchased over the Internet, for $12.48 plus shipping. There was also an interview disc released for the album, in which Sting talks about all tracks on the album.\nThe second track on the album, \"Love Is Stronger Than Justice (The Munificent Seven)\", was named as a homage to the films Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven. According to the interview disc, the idea came to Sting when he wanted to write a song in the 7/4 time signature. The song \"Seven Days\" is also noted for the sophisticated playing of drummer Vinnie Colaiuta in the 5/4 time signature.\nThe international-exclusive track \"Everybody Laughed But You\" was excluded from Canadian and American pressings of the album.

The film follows an Indonesian National Police tactical squad that is deployed to raid a ruthless drug lord's apartment block in the slums of Jakarta, only to be encircled by the criminals, forcing them to fight their way through the complex.\nAfter its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), The Raid received positive reviews from critics. The name of the film was changed to The Raid: Redemption in the United States as distributor Sony Pictures Classics could not secure the rights to the title; it also allowed Evans to plan out future titles in the series. The American version of the film, released on DVD and Blu-ray on 14 August 2012, features a film score composed by Mike Shinoda and Joseph Trapanese.\nA sequel, The Raid 2, was released in 2014. Both films showcase the traditional Indonesian martial art of pencak silat, with fight choreography led by Uwais and Yayan Ruhian.

Together with his lieutenants Andi and Mad Dog, Tama runs the block and allows criminals and addicts to rent rooms under his protection. Arriving undetected, the team sweeps the first floor and subdues various tenants; they also meet a law-abiding tenant named Gofar delivering medicine to his sick wife. Continuing to the sixth floor, the team is spotted by two young lookouts, one of whom raises the alarm after the other is shot.\nTama calls in reinforcements, including a pair of snipers who pick off the officers guarding the block's exterior and a group of gunmen who destroy their SWAT vehicle. Taking advantage of the chaos outside, Tama's men set themselves free and regain control of the first five floors. Tama then cuts the lights and announces over the PA system that the rest of the officers are on the sixth-floor stairwell, and that he will grant permanent residence to those who kill them. Wahyu confesses to Jaka that he staged the mission to eliminate Tama, who is in league with corrupt police officials, including himself; the mission is not officially sanctioned by police command, and there will be no reinforcements. The remaining team members are ambushed by gunmen from above and almost completely wiped out.\nThe remaining officers\u2014Rama, Bowo, Jaka, Wahyu, Dagu, Alee, Hanggi, and another officer\u2014retreat to an empty apartment and are cornered by more armed thugs. Rama uses an axe to create a hole in the floor so the team can descend to the lower level. Dropping to the room below, the team struggles to fend off Tama's thugs; Alee, Hanggi, and the unnamed officer are killed, and Bowo is gravely wounded. Rama uses a propane tank and a refrigerator to construct an improvised explosive device that kills the invading henchmen. With more of Tama's reinforcements approaching, the team splits into two groups: Jaka, Dagu, and Wahyu retreat to the fifth floor, while Rama and Bowo ascend.\nAfter fighting a group of assassins, Rama and Bowo locate Gofar's apartment, and Gofar reluctantly hides the officers inside. Gangs wielding machetes search the apartment but fail to find them. After tending to Bowo's wounds, Rama leaves to search for Jaka's group. Rama encounters the machete gang and defeats them in a long fight, tackling their leader through a window and plummeting onto a fire escape below. On the sixth floor, he finds Andi, who has murdered two of Tama's men. Andi is revealed to be his estranged brother, whom Rama signed up for the mission to search for, at the urging of their father. Rama refuses to leave the building without his comrades, and Andi refuses to abandon his criminal life. Rama parts ways with his brother to search for his surviving colleagues.\nMad Dog discovers Jaka and his group on the fourth floor. Wahyu runs off, and Jaka instructs Dagu to protect him. Mad Dog challenges Jaka to hand-to-hand combat; he ultimately gains the upper hand and kills Jaka by breaking his neck. Mad Dog then meets with Andi to report back to Tama. Tama, having learned of Andi's treachery through his surveillance cameras, attacks and incapacitates Andi. Rama regroups with Dagu and Wahyu, and they head for Tama on the 15th floor, fighting through a narcotics lab along the way. Rama separates from Dagu and Wahyu when he discovers Mad Dog torturing Andi. Mad Dog lets Rama free Andi and fights them both. After a long and brutal fight, Mad Dog is ultimately killed by Rama and Andi.\nMeanwhile, Wahyu and Dagu confront Tama. Wahyu kills Dagu before taking Tama hostage. Tama taunts Wahyu by revealing that he knew they were going to raid the building, that Wahyu was set up by his corrupt superior Reza, and that he will be killed regardless of whether he escapes. A panicked and desperate Wahyu kills Tama and then attempts suicide, only to find he is out of ammunition. Andi uses his influence to allow Rama to leave with the injured Bowo and a detained Wahyu. Andi also hands over blackmail recordings Tama made of the corrupt officials he dealt with, telling him to contact Officer Bunawar. Rama asks Andi to come home, but Andi refuses and asserts that he can protect Rama in the criminal underworld, but that Rama cannot do the same for him on the outside. As Rama, Bowo, and Wahyu leave, Andi turns around and walks back to the apartment block, smiling for the first time."

Uwais previously worked with Evans in Merantau. Having lived for four years in Indonesia and learned about the country's predominant religion, director Gareth Evans implicitly integrated the Muslim faith in Uwais' character.Joe Taslim as Jaka, the Sergeant who leads his unit into the raid. Having been a fan of Merantau, the former judo champion Taslim contacted Evans through Facebook for their next project. As Evans was browsing through Taslim's profile, he came across a photo of him in a SWAT uniform and felt that it resonated with the character. Evans had him undergo choreography and drama auditions, with Taslim earning the role having aced them both.\nRay Sahetapy as Tama Riyadi, a ruthless drug lord who is the boss of the apartment building. Evans wanted a non-stereotypical take on the character, citing most gangster films wherein the boss is usually wearing a pristine suit and smoking cigars.\nYayan Ruhian as Mad Dog, a skilled fighter who is the muscle behind Tama's operation. Ruhian previously worked with Evans in Merantau as an actor and fight choreographer. Evans cast Ruhian in the film as he wanted him to play a \"purely evil\" character, opposite to that which he played in his debut film which had a \"redeemable value\".\nDonny Alamsyah as Andi, Tama's consigliere who is also Rama's estranged elder brother. Alamsyah also played Uwais' character's brother in Merantau. Since he regretted not being able to do action scenes in Merantau, Alamsyah approached Evans as they prepared for The Raid, earning the role having aced the audition.\nIang Darmawan as Gofar, a tenant of the building who tends to his ill wife. Prior to the film, Darmawan's acting credits had been in sketch comedies, and The Raid marks his transition to a serious role.\nPierre Gruno as Wahyu, the Lieutenant who arranges the eponymous raid to take out Tama.\nTegar Satrya as Bowo, the hothead member of the team who is wounded attempting to save the life of a teammate.

It was produced by Muse and Rich Costey, with additional production by John Cornfield and Paul Reeve.\nCostey wanted to give Muse a bigger, more aggressive sound, and Absolution is more polished and direct than their previous albums. It incorporates classical influences, with orchestra on tracks such as \"Butterflies and Hurricanes\" and \"Blackout\", and apocalyptic lyrical themes. Muse used synthesisers and music software to process many tracks. Most of the album was recorded at Grouse Lodge in County Westmeath, Ireland.\nAbsolution reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. It also produced Muse's first top-ten single, \"Time Is Running Out\", which reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart. As of 2018, Absolution had sold more than 3.5 million copies worldwide. A 20th-anniversary reissue with bonus tracks was released in 2023."

In early 2002, they rented a country house outside Brighton for six months to write material. During this period, they were dropped by their American record label, Maverick. They decided to focus on Europe, and embarked on the final leg of their tour for their previous album, Origin of Symmetry, playing the future Absolution songs \"Hysteria\" and \"The Small Print\". After the tour, Muse resumed writing and recording demos in an unused commercial loft in Hackney, London."

        "content": "Muse began recording in late 2002 with the producers John Cornfield and Paul Reed at Air Studios, London, where they recorded \"Butterflies and Hurricanes\" and \"Blackout\". They were joined later by the American producer Rich Costey, who produced the rest of the album. Costey had worked with acts Muse admired, including Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, and wanted to help them find a bigger, more aggressive sound. According to Costey, Muse wanted to sound like a \"colossal, dynamic, epic and powerful rock band\".Muse and Costey returned to Air in late 2002 to work on songs including \"Hysteria\" and  \"Stockholm Syndrome\". The songwriter, Matt Bellamy, restructured \"Hysteria\" after feedback from Costey. For \"Stockholm Syndrome\", Costey vocodered Bellamy's guitar with a Nord modular synthesiser, creating \"hollow, white noisey\" sound. Muse and Costey regrouped in early 2003 for 10 days at Livingston Recording Studios, London, completing the recordings they had made at Air. They then moved to Grouse Lodge, a residential recording studio in County Westmeath, Ireland, where most of the album was recorded.The Grouse Lodge sessions were marred by Muse's strained relationship with their record company. When Muse's co-manager arrived to review their progress, they found him disruptive and threw them out of the studio. They also became involved in a lawsuit with their production company. Bellamy said later that \"there was a genuine sense of impending doom for the band\". The bassist, Chris Wolstenholme, an alcoholic, drank extensively during the sessions.\nTo create basic tracks, the band recorded together live, then focused on overdubs. Costey minimised editing to preserve the \"human touch\" and avoid an artificial result. He added little reverb, preferring to use the natural ambience recorded by the microphones. Bellamy used custom Manson guitars and Marshall and Diezel amps. Wolstenholme split his signal into three Marshall amps, one clean and two distorted, and blended the results. Muse and Costey used the sound design system Kyma to process elements of many tracks, including \"Time is Running Out\", \"Hysteria\" and \"Apocalypse Please\". Bellamy said Kyma added an \"outrageously hi-fi and bright and futuristic sound\"; Costey described it as \"the sound of the record\".\nThe group experimented with drum sounds, using a number of microphones. For the introduction to \"Apocalypse Please\", they recorded two large kick drums in the Grouse Lodge swimming pool. They also recorded Wolstenholme diving into the pool, which was used in the bridge of \"Thoughts of a Dying Atheist\". For \"Ruled By Secrecy\", they recorded a drum take in the courtyard outdoors, hoping to capture an unusual ambience, but discarded the results. On \"Falling Away With You\", Costey was keen to capture the sound of Bellamy's fingers on the guitar strings to create an intimate feeling.For \"Sing for Absolution\", Muse used prepared piano, laying metal objects such as nails and guitar strings on the piano strings. They also processed the piano with a pitch-shifting DigiTech Whammy pedal and an Echloplex delay effect. For \"Ruled By Secrecy\", they blended acoustic piano and a Yamaha CP-80 electric piano. Costey recorded Bellamy's left and right-hand parts separately, and processed them using guitar amps and an Echoplex. \"Time is Running Out\" was the most difficult song to record; the band spent hours working on the bass sound for the introduction, processing Wolstenholme's bass with multiple effects. Eventually, they used a Roland synthesiser played through a Marshall amp.\n\"Endlessly\" was the last song to be completed. Muse struggled to improve on the simplicity of Bellamy's demo, recorded with a piano and a four-to-the-floor drum machine rhythm. Eventually, they used lighter, jazzier drumming and an old Hammond organ. Later in 2003, Muse and Costey spent three weeks in Cello Studios, Los Angeles. They recorded more overdubs, including marching sounds that open the album, and the final version of \"Endlessly\", and mixed the album. They also attracted interest from American labels and signed a contract with Warner Records."

        "content": "Absolution is an alternative rock, progressive rock, hard rock, and art rock album. It features a more polished and direct sound than Muse's previous albums. In 2020, Wolstenholme described it as a continuation of their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001): \"We knew what we wanted to do, and we'd found our feet a little bit, and we felt comfortable with what we did.\"Bellamy wrote most of the songs on piano, including guitar-based songs such as \"Stockholm Syndrome\". For \"Butterflies and Hurricanes\", he sought to create a heavy rock song using classical piano instead of guitar, with a \"mechanical paradiddle thing all the way through\". He was inspired by the \"intensive, repetitive\" piano compositions of Terry Riley, such as \"In C\". \"Blackout\" uses mandolin and orchestra.The lyrics incorporate themes of fear, mistrust, personal achievement and joy, and a general theme of \"things coming to an end\". The beginning of the Iraq War influenced the songwriting, and Bellamy said that the lyrics for \"Apocalypse Please\" followed naturally from the \"epic and in-your-face\" chord progression. The end of Muse's relationship with their American label, Maverick, also influenced the lyrics. Bellamy became interested in conspiracy theories connected to subjects involving the September 11 attacks, which he described as \"good subject matter\" for songwriting. He later disavowed conspiracy theories as dangerous."

Tyler Fisher of Sputnikmusic felt that Absolution was Muse's most consistent album to date and that it perfected their sound, writing that it \"expands on newer sounds and improves on others\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote: \"Muse sound like a band who are at the top of their game. Their confidence carries you through the album's excesses.\" Rob Kemp of Rolling Stone was less enthusiastic, drawing Radiohead comparisons and concluding that Bellamy \"doesn't bring as much ingenuity to his singing\".Absolution was Muse's first album to chart in the US, and is credited with establishing their fan base there. It was the second Muse album released in the US, after a dispute with Maverick Records had canceled the release of Origin of Symmetry there. Absolution reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart and No. 107 on the Billboard 200. It was certified gold in March 2007, becoming Muse's first album to be certified in the US. \"Time Is Running Out\" became Muse's first top-10 single on the UK Singles Chart and was certified gold in the US."

Sohniye\", a unique and extremely jumpy number, is a treat to listen to. \"Bolo Bolo\" features Hariharan and 'Pal' featuring Sagarika has excellent background music and lyrics. \"Chaaye Chaaye\" is the liveliest.According to Bilal, Dhaani is directly related to nature if you closely go through its lyrics. The lyrics have many references to nature such as in the title track one constantly hears words like badal (clouds), nadiya (rivers) and more. Also when the duo were composing the tunes in Murree for about a month they were more exposed to the exotic beauty of the Northern areas and that gave them the idea of having green patches and open skies on the album cover."

When the other turkeys finally realize what is happening, they throw Reggie outside in an attempt to save themselves. To his surprise, he is named the \"pardoned turkey\" by the President of the United States and is taken to Camp David. Reggie soon eases into a routine of doing nothing but enjoying pizza from the \"Pizza Dude\" and watching Mexican telenovelas.\nOne night, Reggie is kidnapped by Jake, a member of the Turkey Freedom Front, who says he has been instructed by \"The Great Turkey\" to take Reggie and go \"back in time to the first Thanksgiving to get turkeys off the menu.\" They steal a time machine controlled by an A.I. named S.T.E.V.E. (Space Time Exploration Vehicle Envoy) from a government facility, and time-travel back to three days before the first Thanksgiving in the year of 1621. Once there, they are ambushed by colonial hunters led by Myles Standish, and are rescued by native turkeys led by Chief Broadbeak and his two children, Ranger and Jenny.\nBroadbeak explains that turkeys have been forced underground since the settlers came, and orders Jake and Ranger to spy on the settlers while Reggie and Jenny spring the humans' hunting traps. Ranger and Jake discover that the settlers have already begun preparations for Thanksgiving, and where they keep their weapons.\nJenny is unconvinced Reggie is from the future, but is impressed with his accidental unorthodox way of springing traps. They are intercepted by Standish, and Reggie sends Jenny into orbit aboard the time machine, validating his story. Reggie asks Jenny to go back to the future with him once everything blows over, but she refuses to leave the flock no matter how much she likes him.\nJake tells Reggie he has a plan to attack the settlers, and that this trip was more about him making up for his failure to save turkey eggs while escaping a factory farm when he was young, maintaining that the Great Turkey convinced him to go through with this. Reggie reluctantly goes along with the plan. They blow up the weapons shack, but Jake inadvertently leaves a gunpowder trail back to the turkeys' hideout. Standish and his men flush the turkeys out from underground, capturing enough for the feast. Broadbeak sacrifices his life to help the remaining turkeys escape. Disgraced, Reggie returns home, where he discovers from S.T.E.V.E. and three alternate versions of himself that he is the Great Turkey. He travels back in time to send the young Jake on his mission. Jenny is sworn in as the new chief and orders the remaining turkeys to prepare an attack on the settlers.\nJenny, Jake and Ranger lead the turkeys in an attack on the settlement just as Chief Massasoit and his tribe arrive. Reggie goes back in time to stop the attack, inadvertently trapping Standish in the time stream. Through S.T.E.V.E. and the Pizza Dude, Reggie convinces the settlers and Native Americans that pizza is a more acceptable food than turkeys, taking turkeys off the Thanksgiving menu entirely. Reggie decides to stay in the 17th century with Jenny while Jake takes S.T.E.V.E. back to the present to look for new adventures.\nIn the mid-credits, Jake returns in S.T.E.V.E. moments after leaving Reggie and Jenny. With a chicken and a duck in his wings, Jake starts to tell the turkeys about the turducken."

Reel FX and Granat Entertainment launched in 2010, Bedrock Studios (later renamed to Reel FX Animation Studios) to produce sub-$35 million family-oriented projects. Ash Brannon was then set to direct the film, but in October 2012, when it was announced that Relativity Media would co-finance, co-produce, and distribute the film, Jimmy Hayward took over the directing position. Originally scheduled for November 14, 2014, the film was moved up by a year to November 27, 2013, due to the vacant slot left after the delay of DreamWorks Animation's Mr. Peabody & Sherman. In March 2013, the film was retitled to Free Birds.\nThe film's score was composed by Dominic Lewis. The soundtrack was released by Relativity Music Group on October 29, 2013."

        "content": "Before Le Marteau, Boulez had established a reputation as the composer of modernist and serialist works such as Structures I, Polyphonie X, as well as his infamously \"unplayable\" Second Piano Sonata. Le Marteau was first written as a six-movement composition between 1953 and 1954, and was published in that form in the latter year, \"imprim\u00e9e pour le festival de musique, 1954, Donaueschingen\" (though in the end it was not performed there) in a photographic reproduction of the composer's manuscript by Universal Edition, given the catalog number UE 12362.\nIn 1955 Boulez revised the order of these movements and interpolated three newly composed ones. The original, six-movement form lacked the two \"Bel \u00c9difice\" settings and the third commentaire on \"Bourreaux de solitude\". In addition, the movements were grouped in two closed cycles: first the three \"Artisanat furieux\" movements, then the three \"Bourreaux de solitude\" ones, otherwise in the order of the final score. The first movement, though fundamentally the same composition, was originally scored as a duet for vibraphone and guitar\u2014the flute and viola were added only in the revision\u2014and numerous less significant alterations were made to playing techniques and notation in the other movements.It received its premi\u00e8re in 1955 at the 29th Festival of the International Society for Contemporary Music in Baden-Baden. Boulez's work was chosen to represent France at this festival. The French members of the committee were against this, but Heinrich Strobel, then director of the Baden-Baden S\u00fcdwestfunk Orchestra, which was scheduled to give all of the concerts at the festival, threatened to withdraw the orchestra if the work was not accepted. The first performance was given on 18 June 1955 conducted by Hans Rosbaud, with Sybilla Plate as the solo singer.Boulez, notorious for considering his works to be always \"in progress\", made further, smaller revisions to Le Marteau in 1957, in which year Universal Edition issued an engraved score, UE 12450. In the years that have followed, it has become Pierre Boulez's most famous and influential work."

        "content": "Steven Winick writes:\n\nIt is well known that Boulez is reluctant to explain his own compositions. When asked to supply program notes for the first performance of Le Marteau in 1955 at the Baden-Baden International Society for Contemporary Music, Boulez laconically wrote, as quoted by Friederich Saathen: \"Le Marteau sans Ma\u00eetre, after a text by Ren\u00e9 Char, written for alto, flute, viola, guitar, vibraphone, and percussion. The text is partially sung, partially interpreted through purely instrumental passages.\"\nDespite having been published in 1954 and 1957, analysts were unable to explain Boulez's compositional methods until Lev Koblyakov in 1977. This is partially due to the fact that Boulez believes in strict control tempered with \"local indiscipline\", or rather, the freedom to choose small, individual elements while still adhering to an overall structure compatible with serialist principles. Boulez opts to change individual notes based on sound or harmony, choosing to abandon adherence to the structure dictated by strict serialism, making the detailed serial organization of the piece difficult for the listener to discern."

        "content": "Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre was hailed by critics, fellow composers, and other musical experts as a masterpiece of the post-war avant-garde from its first performance in 1955. Interviewed in 2014, the composer Harrison Birtwistle declared that Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre \"is the kind of piece, in all the noise of contemporary music that's gone on in my lifetime, I'd like to have written\". Another British composer, George Benjamin, described the work as \"a breakthrough. It is a work in which you can also hear the profound influence of extra-European music, above all from Asia and Africa. This radically alters the sonority and the music's sense of time and direction, as well as its expressive viewpoint and ethos\". One of the most enthusiastic and influential early testimonials came from Igor Stravinsky, who praised the work as an exemplar of \"a new and wonderfully supple kind of music\".However, according to Howard Goodall, the sixty years since its premi\u00e8re have failed to grant Le marteau an equally enthusiastic endorsement from the general public. \"While Boulez's iconoclasm was attractive to some students of twentieth-century classical music, who venerated\u2026 Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre,\u2026 most neutral listeners then as now found both his polemic and his music thoroughly impenetrable\". Despite its attractive surface, its \"smooth sheen of pretty sounds\", issues remain about the music's deeper comprehensibility for the ordinary listener. Even Stravinsky's ear struggled to hear some of the work's polyphonic textures: \"One follows the line of only a single instrument and is content to be 'aware of' the others. Perhaps later the second line and the third will be familiar, but one mustn't try to hear them in the tonal-harmonic sense\". But if we are supposed not to listen in the tonal-harmonic sense, what exactly is it that we should hear and understand in a work which, in the words of Alex Ross, features \"nothing so vulgar as a melody or a steady beat\"? Stravinsky said that repeated hearings, through the availability of recordings, would aid performers more quickly to overcome technical difficulties presented by the music: \"If a work like Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre had been written before the present era of recording it would have reached young musicians outside of the principal cities only years later. As it is this same Marteau, considered so difficult to perform a few years ago, is now within the technique of many players, thanks to their being taught by record\".\nWriting some 40 years since Le Marteau first appeared, composer and music psychologist Fred Lerdahl criticized Koblyakov's approach to analyzing Le Marteau: For one thing, competent listeners to Le Marteau, even after many hearings, still cannot even begin to hear its serial organization, ... [though] [e]xperienced listeners do not find Le Marteau totally incomprehensible. ... Of course a musician of Boulez's calibre would not use a compositional system without drawing crucially upon his musical intuition and experience. Music-generating algorithms alone have always produced primitive outputs; not enough is known about musical composition and cognition for them to succeed. Boulez had the intellectually less ambitious goal of developing a system that could just produce a quantity of musical material having a certain consistency. He then shaped his material more or less intuitively, using both his \"ear\" and various unacknowledged constraints. In so doing, he listened much as another listener might. The organization deciphered by Koblyakov was just a means, and not the only one, towards an artistic end. Lerdahl cautions, however, that \"There is no obvious relationship between the comprehensibility of a piece and its value\". While considering \"complicatedness to be a neutral value and complexity to be a positive one\", and therefore that only musical surfaces leading to complexity employ \"the full potential of our cognitive resources\", many kinds of music satisfy such criteria (e.g., Indian raga, Japanese koto, jazz, and most Western art music), while other types \"fall short\": Balinese gamelan because of its \"primitive pitch space\" and rock music on grounds of \"insufficient complexity\", while much contemporary music (without specific reference to Boulez) \"pursues complicatedness as compensation for a lack of complexity\".Roger Scruton finds Boulez's preoccupation with timbre and sonority in the instrumental writing has the effect of preventing \"simultaneities from coalescing as chords\". As a result, Scruton says that, especially where pitches are concerned, Le Marteau \"contains no recognizable material \u2013 no units of significance that can live outside the work that produces them\". Scruton also feels that the involved overlapping metres notated in the score beg \"a real question as to whether we hear the result as a rhythm at all\". Richard Taruskin found \"Le Marteau exemplified the lack of concern on the part of modernist composers for the comprehensibility of their music\". Equally bluntly, Christopher Small, writing in 1987 said \"It is not possible to invoke any 'inevitable time lag' which is supposed to be required for the assimilation of ...such critically acclaimed works as... Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre... Those who champion 'the new music' await its assimilation into the repertory much as the early Christians awaited the Second Coming\"."

It is one of the eight areas of medicine in Sanskrit literature. In Vedic alchemy, \"rasa\" also means \"metal\" or \"a mineral\".The 11th-century Persian scholar Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n B\u012br\u016bn\u012b noted an Indian science named Ras\u0101yana, focused on restoring health and rejuvenation through plant-derived medicines. Nagarjunacharya conducted experiments in his laboratory called \"Rasashala\" and authored Rasaratanakaram, detailing alchemical transformations of metals. Al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b conflated the earlier ras\u0101yana practices with rasa\u015b\u0101stra alchemy.\nRasa\u015b\u0101stra utilized alchemical processes involving substances like mercury and cinnabar. This practice extended beyond metals, incorporating the preparation of medical tinctures from plants. Rasa\u015b\u0101stra's goals included longevity, health, cognitive enhancement, virility, and extraordinary abilities. Its historical influence was evident in the Ajanta and Ellora cave paintings, the Vishnustambha monument, and the Kondivade caves' processed wood sample.\nIn contemporary times, ras\u0101yana remains relevant through modern formulations combining herbal wisdom and scientific knowledge, reflecting a continued pursuit of well-being and vitality."

However, there is also ample mention of the preparation of medical tinctures in the early science of Indian alchemy.Significant progress in alchemy was made in ancient India. An 11th-century Persian chemist and physician named Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n B\u012br\u016bn\u012b reported \n\n[the Indians] have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them. They call it Ras\u00e2yana, a word composed with rasa, i.e., gold.  It means an art which is restricted to certain operations, drugs, and compound medicines, most of which are taken from plants. Its principles restore the health of those who were ill beyond hope, and give back youth to fading old age...\nTwo known examples were Nagarjunacharya and Nityanadhiya. Nagarjunacharya, was one of the prominent chemists in the history of Indian alchemy. He ran many experiments in his  laboratory known as the \"Rasashala\". His book, Rasaratanakaram is a known example of ancient Indian medicine, in which he describes the procedure of transmuting base metals like mercury, into gold. Due to his contributions and insight in chemistry, he was appointed as chancellor in the university of Nalanda. From the 14th century onwards, many materials from ras\u0101yana and rasa\u015b\u0101stra were translated and integrated in the Persian texts written by Muslim scholars in South Asia."

        "content": "This story is retold by Rudy Panko from Foma Grigorievich, the sexton of the Dikanka church. Rudy is in the middle of reading the story to the reader when Foma interrupts and demands to tell it his way. His grandfather used to live in an old village not far from Dikanka that no longer exists. There lived a Cossack named Korzh, his daughter Pidorka, and his worker Petro. Petro and Pidorka fall in love. One day, Korzh catches Pidorka and Petro kissing and is about to whip Petro, but he stops when his son Ivas pleads for his father not to beat the worker. Korzh instead takes Petro outside and tells him to never come to his home again, and the lovers are distraught. Petro is willing to do anything to see Pidorka again, so he meets with Basavriuk, a stranger who frequents the village tavern and who is believed by the villagers to be the devil himself. Basavriuk tells Petro to meet him in Bear's Ravine in order to obtain the treasure that will allow him to reunite with Pidorka.\nWhen Petro arrives at the location, he is instructed to find and pluck a fern that blooms on Kupala Night. When Petro picks the flower, a witch appears and hands him a spade. Petro digs up the treasure, but he cannot open it until blood has been shed. He is prepared to use his own blood but is presented with Ivas who has been captured. Petro is initially reluctant, but overcome by uncertainty, he decapitates the child and obtains the gold. He then immediately falls asleep for two days, and when he awakens, he sees the gold but cannot remember where it came from. Petro appeases Korzh with the gold, and he marries Pidorka. After they are married, Petro becomes increasingly distant and insane, constantly obsessing over what he has forgotten. As a last resort, Pidorka is convinced to visit the witch for help, and she brings her to their home. Upon seeing the witch, Petro regains his memory of the night and hurls an axe at the witch, who disappears. Ivas appears at the door covered in blood, and Petro is carried away by the devil. All that remains is a pile of ashes where he once stood, and the gold has turned into pieces of broken pottery.\nAfter this, Basavriuk begins to appear in the village again and Pidorka goes on a pilgrimage. Foma's grandfather's aunt still had problems with the devil however; a party is ruined when a roast lamb comes alive, a chalice bows to his grandfather, and a bowl begins to dance. Even after sprinkling the entire area with holy water the tavern remains possessed, so the village becomes abandoned."

        "content": "The story takes place in a Ukrainian village; as such, Gogol uses gastronomy to portray Ukrainian customs, including during the wedding of Petro and Pidorka, the narrator's prayer for his grandfather, and the description of the witch's face (\"like a baked apple\"). St. John's Eve further reflects Ukrainian traditions in the complicated wedding rites described in the story. The temporal setting is the holiday season, which plays a role in the plot of the story.The story is considered a Kunstm\u00e4rchen, a fairy tale that is based in reality or folk tale told by a subjective narrator. Foma Grigorievich, the narrator, describes his grandfather's stories as themselves magically efficacious. In St. John's Eve, as in Gogol's other stories, the laws of nature are often broken; for instance, the devil's gifts float in water.The genre of the story, much like the characterization of the devil character Basavriuk, is initially romantic comedy and ends as \"romantic horror.\""

It was first published in 1837 in the literary magazine Sovremennik.\nThe poem was based on his 1831 teenage version, The Battlefield of Borodino (\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430).The poem starts with the direct appeal \"Tell me, uncle,...\". Lermontov had several relatives (Arsenyevs and Stolypins) who were veterans of the Patriotic War of 1812, and there have been speculation that the poem was based on the narrations of one of them. Other critics suggest that his original version was written under the influence of Denis Davydov's Borodino Battlefield (\u0411\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435)."

Following the success of their previous album, Some Girls, their biggest hit to date, the Rolling Stones returned to the studio in early 1979 to start writing and recording its follow-up. Full-time members Mick Jagger (vocals), Keith Richards (guitar), Ronnie Wood (guitar), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums) were joined by frequent collaborators Ian Stewart (keyboards), Nicky Hopkins (keyboards), Bobby Keys (saxophone) and Sugar Blue (harmonica).\nUpon release, the album topped the charts in at least six countries, including the United States, UK, and Canada. Hit singles from it include the title track, which reached No. 1 in Canada, No. 3 in the United States, and No. 9 in the UK and \"She's So Cold\", a top-40 single in several countries. The recording sessions for Emotional Rescue were so productive that several tracks left off the album would form the core of the follow-up, 1981's Tattoo You."

Fresh from the revitalization of Some Girls (1978), Richards and Mick Jagger led the Stones through dozens of new songs, some of which were held over for Tattoo You (1981), and picked 10 for Emotional Rescue.\nSeveral of the tracks on the album featured just the core Rolling Stones band members: Jagger, Richards, Ronnie Wood, Charlie Watts, and Bill Wyman. On others, they were joined by keyboardists Nicky Hopkins and co-founder Ian Stewart, sax player Bobby Keys and harmonica player Sugar Blue.\nSongs left off the album appeared on Tattoo You (\"Hang Fire\", \"Little T&A\" and \"No Use in Crying\"). \"Think I'm Going Mad\", another song from the sessions, was released as the B-side to \"She Was Hot\" in 1984. A cover song sung by Richards, \"We Had It All\", was released on the 2011 deluxe Some Girls package."

        "content": "Released in June with the disco-infused hit title track as the lead single, Emotional Rescue was an immediate smash. The title track hit No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album gave the Rolling Stones their first UK No. 1 album since 1973's Goats Head Soup and spent seven weeks atop the US charts. The follow-up single \"She's So Cold\" was a top 30 hit while \"Dance Pt. 1\" reached No. 9 on Billboard's Dance chart.\nCritical reception was relatively muted, with most reviewers considering the album somewhat formulaic and unambitious, particularly in contrast to its predecessor. Writing in Rolling Stone, Ariel Swartley stated that \"as far as the music goes, 'familiar' is an understatement. There's hardly a melody here that you haven't heard from the Stones before\". The Village Voice critic Robert Christgau summarized it as \"an ordinary Stones album\" in an essay accompanying the annual Pazz & Jop critics poll of 1980's best albums, in which Emotional Rescue finished 20th, a result which he deemed \"so far out of the money\" for \"the world's greatest rock and roll band\".Retrospective assessments have been kinder, with several critics praising the band's performance, despite the sometimes lightweight material. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic states that the album \"may consist mainly of filler, but it's expertly written and performed filler\". In Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s (1990), Christgau said that, while not \"great\", the album boasts a \"mid-'60s [lyrical] charm\" in \"such tossed-off tropes as 'Where the Boys Go' and 'She's So Cold'\", alongside a musical style \"looser\" than other less-than-great Stones records like It's Only Rock 'n Roll (1974): \"[The music is] far more allusive and irregular and knowing: for better and worse its drive isn't so monolithic, and the bass comes front and center like Bill was James Jamerson.\"In 1994, Emotional Rescue was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, and again in 2009 by Universal Music. In 2011, it was released by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD version. The 1994 remaster was initially released in a Collector's Edition CD, which replicated many elements of the original album packaging, including the colour poster."

It is a derivative of Dutch Godfried, German Gottfried and Old English Gotfrith and Godfrith.\nAlexander Macbain considered it as being found in the Gaelic and Welsh forms; potentially before or contemporary to the Anglo-Saxon, with the examples of Goraidh, Middle Gaelic Gofraig (1467 MS.), Godfrey (do.), Irish Gofraidh (F.M.), Middle Irish Gothfrith, Gofraig (Tigernach, 989), Early Irish Gothfraid (Lib. Lein.), E. Welsh Gothrit (Ann. Camb.). Macbain suggested these Celtic forms of the name were closer related to the Anglo-Saxon Godefrid than the Norse Go\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r, Gudr\u00f8d or G\u00f3r\u00f6\u00f0r; however he does not elaborate further on the origin or relation.\nThe form as 'Geoffrey' was probably introduced to Norman England.\nIt was also Anglicised as Jeffrey later. Popularity of the name declined after the medieval period, but it was revived in modern England and the British Empire at large.

        "content": "The Old French form of the name was Geoffrei [d\u0292\u0254frej], which developed into West Middle French Geoffrey and East Middle French Geoffroy.\nLatinised forms include Jotfredus, Jozsfredus, Josfredus (10th century) and Jof[f]redus, Jofridus, Jaufredus, Geffredus (11th century).The original spelling with Jo- was modified in Geo-. The graphic e after G is used in French to avoid the pronunciation [\u0261o], but [\u0292\u0254] instead. The spelling Geo- is probably due to the influence of the first name Georges, derived from Old French Jorre, Joire.\nThe Old Frankish name Godefrid itself is from the Germanic elements god- and frid-. The Middle Latin form is Godefridus (whence also Godfrey). The second element is widely used in Germanic names, and has a meaning of \"peace, protection\". The first element god- is conflated from two, or possibly three, distinct roots, ie got and possibly *gaut, in origin a tribal name (Geats, Goths) or a theonym (a byname of Wotan).Albert Dauzat (1951, rev. ed. 1980) followed by others, argued that the Middle French name Geoffrey in fact retains a distinction between two Germanic names which became conflated in the Middle Ages. According to this argument, Godfrey continues *goda-fri\u00feu-, while Geoffroy continues *gaut-fri\u00feu-. If a strictly phonetic development is assumed, Geoffrey cannot be derived from Godfrid, as *go- would result in Old French go- [\u0261\u0254] and not geo- (jo-, [d\u0292\u0254]), ie goda-fridu would yield Godefroy [\u0261odfrwa] but not Geoffroy.\nOn the other hand, *gau- [\u0261aw] would regularly result in jo- (geo- [d\u0292\u0254]), i.e *gaut-fridu- would regularly result in Geoffroy [d\u0292\u0254f:rwa].\nAlternative suggestions which would derive the first element from Germanic gisal- 'hostage', or w(e)alah 'Gallo-Roman; stranger' are also rejected by Dauzat as phonetically impossible: gi would have resulted in Old French [d\u0292i] (Modern French [\u0292i]), as in Gisalbert > Gilbert (ie *Gisalfrid > *Giffrey), and *w(e)alh- would have resulted in *gaul- [\u0261ol] (ie *Wealhfrid > *Gaulfrey, *Gauffrey)."

The break was new for her, having almost constantly been at work during the making of the band's first two albums. She explained further, saying, \"I was still going out and going to events but something wasn't quite right, I was spiraling a bit. I wasn't making myself happy. I wasn't stable.\" It allowed her to reassess her musical approach to reflect her own life experiences, a change she credits to consulting with Taylor Swift. Overall, the recording sessions for How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful were conducted during a vulnerable period in her life, making the album her most personal work thus far.Welch began composing the material for How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful after concluding the band's touring in support of Ceremonials in 2014. Regarding the album's themes, she said in a press statement, \"I guess although I've always dealt in fantasy and metaphor when I came to writing, that meant the songs this time were dealing much more in reality. Ceremonials was so fixated on death and water, and the idea of escape or transcendence through death, but the new album became about trying to learn how to live, and how to love in the world rather than trying to escape from it. Which is frightening because I'm not hiding behind anything but it felt like something I had to do.\" Welch also told Lowe that the producer Markus Dravs was instrumental in exploring her lyrical versatility, as he forebade her to write any more songs about water, a main theme in her past compositions. Still, she managed to write \"Ship to Wreck\", a song which she jokingly commented was \"not too explicit\" in comparison to her past works.On 4 June 2014, Welch told NME that the band's third studio album was in the works. There was an emphasised effort to avoid heavily orchestrating the instrumental arrangements, or as Welch described it, \"make Ceremonials Part Two\", as she believed the predecessor had reached its creative peak. Welch said that she wanted to work with Dravs on the album, as he produced Bj\u00f6rk's Homogenic (1997), an important album to Welch. \"I felt he had that balance of organic and electronic capabilities, managing those two worlds. And, you know, he's good with big sounds. And I like big sounds. And he's good with trumpets, and I knew I wanted a brass section on this record\", she said in the press release. \"With Markus, I wanted to make something that was big but that had a gentleness to it, that had a warmth, that was rooted. I think that's why we went back more to the live instruments. Something that was band-led almost\", she added. The final track on the album, \"Mother\", was co-produced by Dravs and Paul Epworth."

In a four out of five star review, the New York Daily News observed that \"[t]he songs have a canny way of avoiding genre cliches\" and artistically, Welch \"draws more from the new wave of Siouxsie and the Banshees or the pan-pop breadth of Annie Lennox's solo career\".Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph praised the album as \"thunderous\" and stated that Welch \"has turned her turmoil into a powerful record, adding a new spiritual depth and mature awareness to the thrill of the wild emotions she has always been able to pump so fearlessly out of her mighty heart and lungs.\" Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork described the album as \"a huge, sturdy record, built for arenas [...] and it's richly and carefully enough constructed to endure the extensive exposure Welch's heartache is going to get over the course of this summer.\" Will Hermes of Rolling Stone opined that \"Welch isn't the most rhythmic singer; she's more about powerful held notes and dramatic articulation, and her rock moves have sometimes felt fussy in the past. But here, she punches like a prizefighter.\" James Christopher Monger of AllMusic expressed that Welch's \"Brit-pop soul treacle is still miles better than some of her contemporaries' top-tier offerings, and when the album connects it moves right in and starts to redecorate, but when it falters, it's akin to a chatty party guest failing to realize that everyone else has gone home.\" In a less enthusiastic review, Andrew Unterberger of Spin dubbed the album \"an exceedingly coherent listen, both in terms of consistent production and lyrical themes [...] But it's not a great album, and that's because the production and dynamics are so compressed to soupy church-soul consistency that once you get into the thick of the LP, it's virtually impossible to keep your attention rapt throughout.\" Alexis Petridis of The Guardian felt that the album is \"too overblown and daft for the songs to have the desired emotional impact: it's never really intimate enough for the feelings Welch expresses to connect.\""

Like many representatives of the Russian intelligentsia, members of this musical community were imbued with the plight of the peasants and sought to write works that would draw people's attention to this poorest layer of society.\nThe young composer Modest Mussorgsky decides to devote his life to music and to make it the property of the people. Only his mother supports his \u201cignoble\u201d undertakings. The young man leaves military service and ponders writing a work about the peasants, together with members of The Five.\nThe Imperial Musical Society is not pleased with the activities of composers; it excludes Mily Balakirev. The writer Vladimir Stasov expresses his opinion by calling the Society newspaper musical liars, eventually ending up in court for libel, and being sued for a monetary penalty. During a trial, many supporters of \"The Five\" are presented.\nA peasant music school, created by composers, is described for debts. Meanwhile, not one of the editions of Mussorgsky\u2019s opera Boris Godunov was allowed to appear in the imperial theaters. The directorate surrenders when the whole city begins to protest; the opera is a tremendous success. Boris Godunov radically changes the direction of the work of Russian composers."

The album was recorded between October 2014 and April 2015 at the Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, with orchestral sections recorded at Officine Meccaniche in Milan, and was produced by the band and Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange. Drones is a concept album following a soldier's abandonment, indoctrination as a \"human drone\", and eventual defection. It also comments on the Obama administration's drone program. After their previous albums incorporated orchestral and electronic music, Muse aimed to return to a more straightforward rock sound musically.\nDrones received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who praised its instrumentation but criticised its concept and lyrics. It topped 21 international charts, including the UK Albums Chart (where it became Muse's fifth consecutive number-one album) and the US Billboard 200. It sold over a million copies worldwide in 2015, making it the year's 19th-bestselling album. At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, it won the award for Best Rock Album. The album was listed on 41 in the NME albums of the year 2015.

In December 2013, they released the live album and video Live at Rome Olympic Stadium; songwriter Matt Bellamy said the band wanted the release \"to capture some of the extremes of what we've been doing since we want to go in a different direction in the future.\"Muse began writing their seventh album soon after the Rome concert. Bellamy stated that the album \"should be something that really does strip away the additional things that we've experimented with on the last two albums... I kind of feel like it will be nice to reconnect and remind ourselves of just the basics of who we are.\" The band felt the electronic side of their music was becoming too dominant. According to bassist Chris Wolstenholme, some of the music on The 2nd Law was \"somewhat of a bore to play live, and I'm not too certain how much of it worked for our shows ... The logical step was to strip away all the outer layers and go back to the way we started. Sometimes, making things simpler makes them more powerful.\""

After having used several different bass guitars and effect pedals for The 2nd Law, Wolstenholme used only one bass guitar and a small number of pedals, hoping to find a cohesive sound.The first recording session ended on 19 October, with the band calling it \"emotional\". Muse re-entered the studio in November 2014. On 1 April 2015, drummer Dominic Howard and mixer Rich Costey indicated on their Instagram accounts that they had finished mixing the album.

In March 2015, he said:\n\nTo me, drones are metaphorical psychopaths which enable psychopathic behaviour with no recourse. The world is run by drones utilising drones to turn us all into drones. This album explores the journey of a human, from their abandonment and loss of hope, to their indoctrination by the system to be a human drone, to their eventual defection from their oppressors.\nIn an interview in the same month, Bellamy described Drones as \"a modern metaphor for what it is to lose empathy ... through modern technology, and obviously through drone warfare in particular, it's possible to actually do quite horrific things by remote control, at a great distance, without actually feeling any of the consequences, or even feeling responsible in some way.\""

Muse's music once more matches [Bellamy's] adventurous intrigue.\"AllMusic wrote that \"it's hard to avoid [Muse's] conclusion that war is bad, but this inclination to write everything in bold, italicized capital letters is an asset when it comes to music.\" Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote that despite the \"trite\" lyrics and \"confusing\" plot, some of Drones was \"fist-pumpingly ace; a timely restatement of the need for popular music to evoke both thought and dopamine rush.\" Ian Cohen of Pitchfork found that Drones lacked subtlety and criticised its lyrics, writing, \"Whatever pleasure can be generated from Bellamy's admirable melodic sense and overblown hooks is negated by Muse's insistence that they're profound rather than fun.\" Oliver Keens of Time Out London called the album's handling of the drones subject matter \"tactless and crass\" and its story \"as dull as dog food \u2013 told with the wishy-washy flim-flam of a frothing conspiracy theorist ... We used to moan that musicians didn't write about politics anymore. Based on this effort, maybe that's for the best.\" Rolling Stone named it the 38th best album of 2015, calling it a \"searing commentary on our era's vague dread, computer-driven death from above and Orwellian political climate ... It was the year's most convincing howl from the abyss.\"The Daily Telegraph wrote that \"It's more than a little Spinal Tap, but if I was a teenage boy this is exactly the kind of thrilling madness that might turn me on to a moribund genre.\" The Evening Standard gave it four out of five and wrote: \"Prog phobics might dismiss it as latter-day Pink Floyd with a dash of Noam Chomsky.

The film stars James Franco, Kate Mara, Amber Tamblyn, and Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy. In the film, canyoneer Aron Ralston must find a way to escape after he gets trapped by a boulder in an isolated slot canyon in Bluejohn Canyon, southeastern Utah, in April 2003. It is a British and American venture produced by Path\u00e9, Everest Entertainment, Film4 Productions, HandMade Films and Cloud Eight Films.\nThe film, based on Ralston's memoir Between a Rock and a Hard Place (2004), was written by Boyle and Simon Beaufoy, co-produced by Christian Colson and John Smithson, and scored by A. R. Rahman. Beaufoy, Colson, and Rahman had all previously worked with Boyle on Slumdog Millionaire (2008). 127 Hours was acclaimed by critics and audiences and grossed $60 million worldwide. It was selected by the American Film Institute as one of the top 10 films of 2010 and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Franco and Best Picture.\nThe film's title refers to the period of non-stop activity from when Ralston was stranded in Bluejohn Canyon once his arm was trapped underneath a boulder, to when he was rescued."

He befriends lost hikers Kristi and Megan and gives them directions. While guiding them, he shows them an underground pool. The three have a good time there, and that afternoon, the girls invite him to a party that is being held the following night. Aron accepts and says goodbye to the girls, who head home. He continues through a slot canyon in Bluejohn Canyon. While climbing, an 800-pound (360 kg) boulder he is hanging off comes loose and causes both to fall, which traps his right arm against the wall. Aron attempts to move the boulder, but it does not budge; he also soon realizes he is alone. He shortly begins recording a video diary using his camcorder to maintain morale as he chips away parts of the boulder with a pocket knife. At one point, the knife falls off his hand, and he is forced to use his bare feet and a little branch to recover it. Over the next five days, Aron rations his food and remaining 300ml of water, struggles to keep warm at night, and is forced to drink his urine when his water runs out. He also sets up a pulley using his climbing rope in a futile attempt to lift the boulder.\nThroughout the days, Aron becomes desperate and depressed and begins hallucinating about escape, relationships, and past experiences, including his family and his former girlfriend, Rana. He also imagines going to the party he was invited to and having fun. During one hallucination, Aron realizes his mistake was that he did not tell anyone where he was going or for how long. Aron has a vision of his future son on the sixth day, spurring his will to survive. He fashions a tourniquet from CamelBak tube insulation and uses a carabiner to tighten it. Then, using his knowledge of torque, he breaks the bones in his arm and, using the multi-tool, slowly amputates it. Aron then wraps the stump to prevent exsanguination and takes a picture of the boulder before rappelling down a 65 ft (20 m) rockface. He then finds some rainwater collected while descending down, drinks the stagnant water due to dehydration, and continues. He spots a family on a hike in the desert and calls for help. They give him water and alert the authorities; a Utah Highway Patrol helicopter brings him to a hospital.\nA textual epilogue reveals that years later, Aron got married and had a son. He also continues climbing and always leaves a note telling his family where he has gone."

Despite these changes, with which he was initially uncomfortable, Ralston says the rest of the film is \"so factually accurate it is as close to a documentary as you can get and still be a drama.\"Other changes from the book include omissions of descriptions of Ralston's efforts after freeing himself: his bike was chained to itself, not to the tree as depicted at the beginning of the movie; he had to decide where to seek the fastest medical attention; he took a photo of himself at the small brown pool from which he really did drink; he had his first bowel movement of the week; he abandoned many of the items he had kept throughout his confinement; he got lost in a side canyon; and he met a family from the Netherlands (not an American family), Eric, Monique, and Andy Meijer, who already knew that he was probably lost in the area, thanks to the searches of his parents and the authorities. (The actor who plays Eric Meijer, Pieter Jan Brugge, is Dutch.)\nFranco is never shown uttering even an \"Ow\"; Ralston wrote that this is accurate. Ralston did send Monique and Andy to run ahead to get help, and Ralston did walk seven miles before the helicopter came, although this trek is shown in the film's alternative ending."

Boyle describes 127 Hours as \"an action movie with a guy who can't move.\" He also expressed an interest for a more intimate film than his previous film, Slumdog Millionaire (2008): \"I remember thinking, I must do a film where I follow an actor the way Darren Aronofsky did with The Wrestler. So 127 Hours is my version of that.\"Boyle and Fox Searchlight announced plans to create 127 Hours in November 2009. Cillian Murphy was reportedly approached by Boyle to play Ralston. In January 2010, James Franco was cast as Ralston. In March 2010, filming began in Utah; Boyle intended to shoot the first part of the film with no dialogue. By 17 June 2010, the film was in post-production.Boyle made the very unusual move of hiring two cinematographers to work first unit, Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak, each of whom shot 50 percent of the film by trading off with each other. This allowed Boyle and Franco to work long days without wearing out the crew.Boyle enlisted makeup effects designer Tony Gardner and his effects company, Alterian, Inc., to re-create the character's amputation of his own arm. Boyle stressed that the realism of the arm as well as the process itself were key to the audience's investing in the character's experience, and that the makeup effects' success would impact the film's success. The false arm rigs were created in layers, from fiberglass and steel bone, through silicone and fibrous muscle and tendon, to functional veins and arteries, and finally skinned with a translucent silicone layer of skin with a thin layer of subcutaneous silicone fat. Gardner states that the effects work was extremely stressful, as he wanted to do justice to the story; he credits James Franco equally with the success of the effects work. Three prosthetics were used in all, with two designed to show the innards of the arm and another to emulate the outside of it. Franco would later note that seeing blood on the arm was difficult for him and his reactions in those scenes were genuine.Franco admitted that shooting the film was physically hard on him: \"There was a lot of physical pain, and Danny knew that it was going to cause a lot of pain. And I asked him after we did the movie, 'How did you know how far you could push it?' ... I had plenty of scars...Not only am I feeling physical pain, but I'm getting exhausted. It became less of a fa\u00e7ade I put on and more of an experience that I went through.\""

        "content": "Weird Tales is an American fantasy and horror fiction pulp magazine founded by J. C. Henneberger and J. M. Lansinger in late 1922. The first issue, dated March 1923, appeared on newsstands February 18. The first editor, Edwin Baird, printed early work by H. P. Lovecraft, Seabury Quinn, and Clark Ashton Smith, all of whom went on to be popular writers, but within a year, the magazine was in financial trouble.  Henneberger sold his interest in the publisher, Rural Publishing Corporation, to Lansinger, and refinanced Weird Tales, with Farnsworth Wright as the new editor.  The first issue to list Wright as editor was dated November 1924.  The magazine was more successful under Wright, and despite occasional financial setbacks, it prospered over the next 15 years.  Under Wright's control, the magazine lived up to its subtitle, \"The Unique Magazine\", and published a wide range of unusual fiction.\nLovecraft's Cthulhu mythos stories first appeared in Weird Tales, starting with \"The Call of Cthulhu\" in 1928.  These were well-received, and a group of writers associated with Lovecraft wrote other stories set in the same milieu.  Robert E. Howard was a regular contributor, and published several of his Conan the Barbarian stories in the magazine, and Seabury Quinn's series of stories about Jules de Grandin, a detective who specialized in cases involving the supernatural, was very popular with the readers.  Other well-liked authors included Nictzin Dyalhis, E. Hoffmann Price, Robert Bloch, and H. Warner Munn.  Wright published some science fiction, along with the fantasy and horror, partly because when Weird Tales was launched,  no magazines were specializing in science fiction, but he continued this policy even after the launch of magazines such as Amazing Stories in 1926.  Edmond Hamilton wrote a good deal of science fiction for Weird Tales, though after a few years, he used the magazine for his more fantastic stories, and submitted his space operas elsewhere.\nIn 1938, the magazine was sold to William Delaney, the publisher of Short Stories, and within two years, Wright, who was ill, was replaced by Dorothy McIlwraith as editor.  Although some successful new authors and artists, such as Ray Bradbury and Hannes Bok, continued to appear, the magazine is considered by critics to have declined under McIlwraith from its heyday in the 1930s.  Weird Tales ceased publication in 1954, but since then, numerous attempts have been made to relaunch the magazine, starting in 1973.  The longest-lasting version began in 1988 and ran with an occasional hiatus for over 20 years under an assortment of publishers. In the mid-1990s, the title was changed to Worlds of Fantasy and Horror because of licensing issues, the original title returning in 1998.\nThe magazine is regarded by historians of fantasy and science fiction as a legend in the field, Robert Weinberg considering it \"the most important and influential of all fantasy magazines\".  Weinberg's fellow historian, Mike Ashley, describes it as \"second only to Unknown in significance and influence\", adding that \"somewhere in the imagination reservoir of all U.S. (and many non-U.S.) genre-fantasy and horror writers is part of the spirit of Weird Tales\"."

        "content": "In the late 19th century, popular magazines typically did not print fiction to the exclusion of other content; they would include nonfiction articles and poetry, as well.  In October 1896, Frank A. Munsey Company's Argosy magazine was the first to switch to printing only fiction, and in December of that year, it changed to using cheap wood-pulp paper.  This is now regarded by magazine historians as having been the start of the pulp magazine era.  For years, pulp magazines were successful without restricting their fiction content to any specific genre, but in 1906, Munsey launched Railroad Man's Magazine, the first title that focused on a particular niche.  Other titles that specialized in particular fiction genres followed, starting in 1915 with Detective Story Magazine, with Western Story Magazine following in 1919.Weird fiction, science fiction, and fantasy all appeared frequently in the pulps of the day, but by the early 1920s, still no single magazine was focused on any of these genres, though The Thrill Book, launched in 1919 by Street & Smith with the intention of printing \"different\", or unusual, stories, was a near miss.In 1922, J. C. Henneberger, the publisher of College Humor and The Magazine of Fun, formed Rural Publishing Corporation of Chicago, in partnership with his former fraternity brother, J. M. Lansinger.  Their first venture was Detective Tales, a pulp magazine that appeared twice a month, starting with the October 1, 1922 issue.  It was initially unsuccessful, and as part of a refinancing plan, Henneberger decided to publish another magazine that would allow him to split some of his costs between the two titles.  Henneberger had long been an admirer of Edgar Allan Poe, so he created a fiction magazine that would focus on horror, and titled it Weird Tales."

Thereafter Wildside Press was the publisher, sometimes with Terminus listed as well, until the September/October 2007 issue, after which only Wildside Press were listed.  The issues published from 2012 through 2014 were from Nth Dimension Media.Weird Tales was in pulp format for its entire first run except for the issues from May 1923 to April 1924, when it was a large pulp, and the last year, from September 1953 to September 1954, when it was a digest.  The four 1970s issues were in pulp format.  The two Bellerophon issues were quarto.  The Terminus issues reverted to pulp format until the Winter 1992/1993 issue, which was large pulp.  A single pulp issue appeared in Fall 1998, and then the format returned to large pulp until the Fall 2000 issue, which was quarto.  The format varied between large pulp and quarto until January 2006, which was large pulp, as were all issues after that date until Fall 2009, except for a quarto-sized November 2008.  From Summer 2010 the format was quarto.The first run of the magazine was priced at 25 cents for the first fifteen years of its life except for the oversized May/June/July 1924 issue, which was 50 cents.  In September 1939 the price was reduced to 15 cents, where it stayed until the September 1947 issue, which was 20 cents.  The price went up again to 25 cents in May 1949; the digest-sized issues from September 1953 to September 1954 were 35 cents.  The first three paperbacks edited by Lin Carter were priced at $2.50; the fourth was $2.95.  The two Bellerophon issues were $2.50 and $2.95.  The Terminus Weird Tales began in Spring 1988 priced at $3.50; this went up to $4.00 with the Fall 1988 issue, and to $4.95 with the Summer 1990 issue.  The next price increase was to $5.95, in Spring 2003, and then to $6.99 with the January 2008 issue.  The first two issues from Nth Dimension Media were priced at $7.95 and $6.99; the last two were $9.99 each.Some of the early Terminus editions of Weird Tales were also printed in hardcover format, in limited editions of 200 copies.  These were signed by the contributors, and were available at $40 as part of a subscription offer.  Issues produced in this format include Summer 1988, Spring/Fall 1989, Winter 1989/1990, Spring 1991, and Winter 1991/1992."

        "content": "State.ie (formerly State Magazine) was an Irish website and, before, a monthly music magazine. It launched in April 2008 and switched to online-only distribution in January 2009 after having published a total of ten issues. The magazine continued online until 2020, when that year's edition of its Faces series prominently mentioned the website having ceased publication.It enjoyed a good run and was voted Best Music Site in 2008 and Best Web Publication in 2010 in the Irish Web Awards. Originally, the concept of the magazine involved a hard copy of which there was a charge to purchase. However after six issues it was decided to make the magazine's content free both online and in print. The first issue, April 2008, appeared on Irish shelves on 6 March 2008 and featured Michael Stipe of R.E.M. on the cover. This immediately garnered comparisons between the new magazine's similarities with Hot Press who featured Stipe on their cover at the same time, a move widely thought to be an attempt by Hot Press to stifle State's status as a serious 'alternative' to the more established local magazine. At a price of \u20ac5.50, State charged \u20ac2 more than Hot Press.State was published by Roger Woolman and edited by Hot Press alumni Phil Udell. Contributors included Evening Herald columnist, The Irish Times reviewer and blogger Sin\u00e9ad Gleeson, Rolling Stone writer Kara Manning, award-winning blogger Niall Byrne (a.k.a. Nialler9), Event Guide writer David O'Mahony and The Star feature writer Tanya Sweeney. The magazine's art director, Simon Roche, was named designer of the year by the Periodical Publishers Association of Ireland in December 2008.\nFrom October 2008 until January 2009 the magazine was made available for free of charge from a number of venues around Ireland's major cities and online from the magazine's website, following a number of other magazines such as Mongrel, Connected and Analogue Magazine in providing their print content free of charge. The first freely distributed issue of State featured Kings of Leon on the cover. After January 2009, the magazine was only available online from its website."

        "content": "\"Bobok\" (Russian: \u0411\u043e\u0431\u043e\u043a, Bobok) is a short story by Fyodor Dostoevsky that first appeared in 1873 in his self-published Diary of a Writer. The story consists largely of a dialogue between recently deceased occupants of graves in a cemetery, most of whom are fully conscious and retain all the features of their living personalities. The dialogue is overheard by a troubled writer who has lain down near the graves.\nThe title \"Bobok\" refers to a nonsensical utterance repeatedly made by one of the cemetery's residents, an almost completely decomposed corpse who is otherwise silent. The writer also reports a kind of auditory hallucination of the word prior to his hearing of the dialogue. The sound suggests \"little bean\" in Russian, but in the context of the story is taken to be synonymous with gibberish.The philosopher and literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin regarded Bobok as one of the finest works in the literary tradition of Menippean satire, and argues that it encapsulates many of the thematic concerns of Dostoevsky's major novels."

        "content": "The story begins with a stream of short, self-referring internal polemics with various individuals and points of view by a frustrated writer called Ivan Ivanovich. The apparently disconnected and random nature of his speech suggests some sort of mental disturbance, possibly related to delirium tremens: his very first polemical engagement is with an acquaintance who has asked him if he will ever be sober. He is aware himself that something strange is happening to him: \"not voices exactly, but it's as if someone right beside me is saying 'Bobok, bobok, bobok!'\"Ivan Ivanovich goes out in search of distraction and chances upon a funeral. It turns out to be that of a distant relative of his, a collegiate councillor with five unmarried daughters. He joins the procession but is ignored by his relative's family. He observes and contemplates the cemetery\u2014the smell, the newly arrived corpses, the graves, the mourners\u2014some of whom are only pretending to mourn and others who are openly cheerful. When everyone leaves he stays at the cemetery and falls into contemplation. After sitting for a long time, his mind wandering, he lies down on a long stone coffin and is shocked to find that the voices of the recently deceased and buried seem to become audible to him. He listens to their conversation. A variety of individuals, all disembodied continuations of their living personalities, converse and argue with each other. It seems that physical death is not final death and that here, according to the philosopher Platon Nikolaevich, \"the remnants of life are concentrated, but only in consciousness\" and continue for a time \"as if by inertia\". Despite their \"dead\" status, the corpses are not only able to hear each other but to smell each other, a state of affairs that Platon Nikolaevich explains as a stench of the soul meant to bring it to a new state of awareness. Though one or two individuals show a sober and pious attitude to their situation, most of them exhibit a propensity to hold on to, and even reinforce and exaggerate, the moral failings of their earthly personalities. A new arrival called Baron Klinevich suggests that they entertain themselves and each other by revealing all the shameful details of their earthly lives, a proposal that is met with gleeful and almost universal approval. Pandemonium descends, but at this point Ivan Ivanovich suddenly sneezes, and the dead are silent thereafter. Ivan Ivanovich leaves the cemetery distressed that depravity exists even in the grave, \"the last moments of consciousness\". He feels that despite the desire to lose their sense of shame, the dead have a secret that they carefully conceal from mortal men. He contemplates returning to listen to their stories, and to visit other parts of the cemetery to get a fuller understanding of what is going on. He thinks he will be able to publish his account in The Citizen."

        "content": "Ivan Ivanovich, the narrator, is an alienated and cynical writer with a character comparable to that of the underground man in Notes from Underground. His writing style is concise and categorical but simultaneously ambiguous and evasive. He polemicizes with everyone \u2013 friends, editors who reject his work, the contemporary public and, after listening to the underground dialogue, with \"contemporary corpses\".\nLebeziatnikov, an obsequious official with a \"soft and saccharine\" voice, is the first voice to be heard, discussing a card game played from memory with his superior, General Pervoedov. Throughout the ensuing dialogues Lebeziatnikov acts as a \"sepulchral minion\" to the General and assumes a kind of explanatory role for others in relation to 'life' in the grave.\nGeneral Pervoedov, the owner of the grave directly under the narrator. In contrast to Lebeziatnikov his voice is \"weighty and authoritative\": it is clear that he wishes to maintain in the grave the dignity and importance that attached to his life on the surface. Lebeziatnikov is more than happy to play along, but others such as Avdotia Ignatievna and Baron Klinevich contemptuously dismiss his pretensions and gleefully insult him.\nAvdotia Ignatievna, an irritable high society lady who insults and argues with a number of the others, including a shopkeeper who lies next to her, and the General, who refers to her as a \"twittering busybody\". She has a great urge to lose her sense of shame and is delighted by Baron Klinevich's suggestion.\nA shopkeeper, the only participant in the dialogue who maintains a connection with the faith of the common people, and who therefore accepts death as a sacrament and interprets what is going on as the tribulations of sinful souls after death.\n\"A whining newcomer\", who died unexpectedly after having \"complications\" and can't accept that he is dead and buried. The narrator remembers seeing him in his coffin with a terrified and repulsive expression on his face.\nBaron Klinevich is a recently deceased libertine-nobleman who characterizes himself as a \"scoundrel of pseudo-high society\". He proposes to the other corpses that for their remaining time they \"cast aside all shame\" and amuse each other by not lying about themselves. He complains that in his own life he was constantly encountering moral and societal restraints on his predatory nature and that life was synonymous with lying, but that here in death they could spend their short remaining time reveling in \"shameless truthfulness\".\nPrivy Councilor Tarasevich, a very high ranking official who died just after it was discovered that he had stolen 400,000 rubles from a government support scheme for widows and orphans. Klinevich suggests that it was those widows and orphans that \"warmed his blood\" for a life of dissipation, and Tarasevich's subsequent utterances tend to confirm this impression.\nKatish Berestova, a 16 year old girl who responds when addressed, but only ever with a lascivious giggle. She has \"a cracked, girlish voice, but in that voice one felt something like the prick of a needle.\" Klinevich, who knew her in life, recommends her to Tarasevich, who reacts with trembling anticipation.\nAn engineer, newly deceased, who babbles nonsense for a time but becomes coherent and animated when Klinevich proposes the abandonment of shame. As he understands it, the Baron is proposing that they organise life in the grave on \"new and rational principles\".\nPlaton Nikolaevich is a deceased philosopher who (according to Lebeziatnikov) explains how the life of the conscious mind and the formerly living personality continues for a short time (usually 2\u20133 months but sometimes up to 6 months) after death, but now without any associated bodily reality, concentrated somehow only in consciousness.\nAn almost entirely decomposed corpse who (according to Lebeziatnikov) comes to life every six weeks and mutters \"Bobok, Bobok.\""

        "content": "According to Mikhail Bakhtin, thematically Bobok is \"almost a microcosm of [Dostoevsky's] entire creative output.\" Among such themes are: the idea that if there is no God and no immortality of the soul then \"everything is permitted\"; the related theme of confession as \"shameless truth\" with no need of repentance; the consideration of the final moments of consciousness, connected to the themes of capital punishment and suicide in other works, for example in The Idiot; the theme of insanity; the theme of sensuality and its apparent inseparability from consciousness in any sphere; the theme of the nihilistic chaos of life and thought when they are cut off from national roots and spiritual faith.\nSome of the characters are abbreviated versions of types that appear in the novels. The libertine advocate of shamelessness Klinevich is a concentrated miniature of characters like Svidrigailov from Crime and Punishment, Fyodor Pavlovich from The Brothers Karamazov, and Prince Valkovsky from Humiliated and Insulted. The bitter and ironic narrator (referred to in the subtitle as \"a certain person\") is a type akin to the Underground Man in Notes From Underground. The dissipated old official who has been found to have embezzled a huge sum of public funds, the self-important General, the sycophantic but knowledgeable junior official, the Engineer with revolutionary inclinations, and the humble shopkeeper who has retained his connection to his people and his faith, are all types that are familiar to readers of Dostoevsky's larger works."

        "content": "Dostoevsky was prompted to write the story by a journalist's reaction to the first instalments of the Diary of a Writer. At the time, Dostoevsky edited the newspaper-magazine \"The Citizen\", where the first chapters of the Diary were printed. The liberal newspaper \"The Voice\" published a response to the Diary written by the journalist L. K. Panyutin (writing under the pseudonym Nil Admirari). Dostoevsky's attention was piqued by one passage in particular: \"The Diary of a Writer\" reminds one of the famous diary that ends with the exclamation \"Still, the Algerian Bey has a bump on his nose!\" [Nikolai Gogol's short story \"Diary of a Madman\"]. It is enough to look at the portrait of the author, currently exhibited at the  Academy of Arts, in which we feel for Mr. Dostoevsky the very \u201cpity\u201d that he so inappropriately mocks in his magazine. This is a portrait of a person exhausted by a serious illness.\nThe narrator of \"Bobok\" responds to the journalist at the beginning of the story, among a stream of apparently random polemics:I am not offended, I am a timid man; but, nevertheless, they made me out to be mad. An artist happened to paint a portrait of me: \"After all,\" he says, \"you are a writer.\" So I let him have his way, and he put the portrait on exhibit. And now I read: \"Go and look at this sickly, almost insane face.\" Well, let it be so, but do they have to say it so directly in print? Everything that appears in print should be noble; ideals are necessary, but here ...\nThe portrait is alluded to again in the closing sentences of \"Bobok\", as Ivan Ivanovich contemplates publishing an account of his experience: \"I will take it to \"the Citizen\". One of the editors there also had his portrait exhibited.\" Dostoevsky was not merely concerned with drawing attention to the journalist's tactlessness.  As in Gogol's story, the abrupt, disjointed style of the narration and the qualities of the narrator's experience suggest a man on the brink of madness, although there is an implication that it is related to alcoholism rather than the epilepsy from which Dostoevsky suffered.\nThe narrator's polemic on the subject of astonishment seems to be aimed at Panyutin\u2019s pseudonym Nil Admirari (nihil admirari, \"not to be surprised at anything\" \u2013 Horace). According to Ivan Ivanovich:It's ridiculous, of course, to be surprized at everything, while being surprized at nothing is much more attractive and for some reason is considered good form. But it is hardly so in reality. In my opinion, being surprised at nothing is much more stupid than to be surprized at everything. And besides, to be surprized at nothing is almost the same as to respect nothing. A stupid person isn't capable of respect.\nThe cemetery setting and dialogue was in part a satirical response to Panyutin. In 1870, Panyutin published a feuilleton in \"The Voice\" dedicated to the festivities at the Smolensk cemetery. The main character of the feuilleton also observes the behavior of the crowd in the cemetery, analyzes the \"drunken\" conversations of the still living people, and then, tired, decides to rest on one of the graves, having previously asked permission from the deceased. The dead man, allowing the weary observer to take a nap on his grave, enters into conversation with him, inquiring about the latest news from the living world."

At the top of the article he wrote: On this occasion I shall include \"The Notes of a Certain Person.\" That person is not I, but someone else entirely. I think no further foreword is needed. The 8th article of 1873 is entitled \"A Half-Letter from 'A Certain Person' \", which the author of the diary describes as being by \"that same 'person', the very one who has already once distinguished himself in The Citizen on the subject of graves.\" The author of the diary discusses, in an exasperated tone, this \"person\", who has written him a long and convoluted letter in which he attacks and admonishes all sorts of people, particularly those in publishing, including the letter's addressee. The diary's author agrees to publish the letter, partly in an effort to finally appease and get rid of the \"person\". He refuses to publish the first half of the letter due to its excessive vitriol, so it begins halfway through, in the middle of a sentence."

The song was then rearranged by its four composers, together with producer Shlomo Tzach, into an up-tempo number with a mix of mostly Hebrew lyrics with some English lyrics sprinkled in the chorus and throughout."

        "content": "\"Born to be Abramo?\" is a sample from a contemporary advertisement for \"Ava\" laundry detergent, where Claudia Mori sang a reference to \"La terra dei cachi\" on a different melody, possibly for copyright reasons. The sample is interrupted by a loud scream from the band members.\n\"Born to be Abramo\" is a re-recording of the band's banned 1990 single, featuring guest Patrick Hernandez singing a parody of his own hit \"Born to Be Alive\" on religious-themed Italian lyrics by missionary Gigi Cocquio.\n\"L'astronauta pasticcione\" (\"The bungling astronaut\"), the first of two previously unreleased songs on the album, is a ballad about a very inept astronaut who gets sick with diarrhea as a result of space travel and ends up releasing his feces into his space suit, causing a horribly unbearable smell. The song, however, describes the event in a very sweet, almost poetical way. On a musical level, the song's chorus uses the chords from the 1975 song \"Lighthouse\" by James Taylor, as well as a reference to \"Squonk\" (1976) by Genesis.\n\"Introservi\" is a ballad-like intro to the following track, \"Servi della gleba\", already released as a ghost track on \u0130talyan, rum casusu \u00e7ikti.\n\"Servi della gleba\", \"Tapparella\", \"Pipppero\" and \"Burattino senza fichi\" are all identical to the respective versions on the band's past albums.\n\"La terra dei cachi\" is the studio version of the song, previously available only on a promo single. The band's live performance of the song at the 1996 Sanremo Music Festival was released on Eat the Phikis.\n\"L'eterna lotta tra il bene e il male\" (\"The eternal fight between good and evil\"), the second previously unreleased song on the album, uses the backing track to the 1995 song \"Very Good Very Bad\", from the Bollywood film Trimurti, overlaid with multiple samples from a series of angry, offending and profane voicemails left on keyboard player Sergio Conforti's answering machine by an anonymous elderly lady from Milan, nicknamed \"Nasty sciura\" (\"sciura\" being Milanese for \"lady\") by Conforti (a.k.a. Rocco Tanica) - who apparently mistook him for the band's lead singer. In the voicemails, \"Nasty sciura\" repeatedly insults Conforti about the recurring use of vulgarity in the band's songs, accusing him (among other things) of having mentally corrupted her son. This track also includes a few lines sung by Elio on a melody from \"Within You, Without You\" by The Beatles.\n\"Abitudinario\", \"Supergiovane\" and \"John Holmes\" are new recordings of the respective songs, with small alterations (mostly consisting in slight changes to the performances and the samples used on the tracks).\n\"Cara ti amo\" is a completely new recording of the same-titled song, a surreal dialogue between two lovers, from Elio samaga hukapan kariyana turu. It is purported to be live but it was actually made in a studio, as the purported location of the live recording, \"Baritone Women's Bar in Prugliasco, Switzerland\", is invented - although \"Planet of the Baritone Women\" is a track from Frank Zappa's 1988 live album Broadway the Hard Way. As on the previous album version, the dialogue (performed by Elio and Tanica) is almost completely improvised.\n\"Alfieri\" (\"Ensigns\") is the only officially available version, recorded live in 1986 in a Legnano club, of the band's concluding song from their 1980s/early 1990s live shows, where, after a semi-serious verse by Elio, each band member introduces himself in a comedic verse, before ending with an equally comedic unison choir. On this particular recording, bassist Nicola Fasani (a.k.a. Faso or Pasto) and guitarist Davide Civaschi (a.k.a. Ces\u00e0reo) are heard laughing throughout their verses (because the other members are teasing them and playing practical jokes to them) and barely managing to sing their lyrics.\n\"Sos epidos\" (\"The debts\" in Sardinian) is a satirical song about debts, sung in the local language by a group of Sardinian tenores."

Numbers begin circulating: hundreds of people will come,  thousands say the media. To the poor citizens of Melo this means  pilgrims in need of food and drink, paper flags, souvenirs, and commemorative medals. Brimming with enthusiasm, the locals hope not only for divine blessing but also a small share of material happiness. Petty smuggler Beto is certain that he's found the best business idea of all: \"The Pope\u2019s Toilet\", where the thousands of visiting pilgrims can find relief.\nBeto is thwarted by lack of funds and the local mobile customs enforcement officer. Ultimately the promised \"60,000 to 200,000\" Brazilians do not materialise. Apparently (in the film's postscript) only 400 Brazilians came, disproportionately served by 387 stalls for food and trinkets. The film makes it clear that the visit was a financial disaster to the town rather than bringing any wealth as promised. Beto has spent his daughter's college fund to no avail, but she forgives him, and at least he has a nice toilet.\nRegardless of the claims made in the film's postscript committed to uphold a good sense of humor at all costs, international media reported the Pope's open-air mass in the town of Melo with 39,000 inhabitants was attended by a crowd of about 50,000 people."

Its dual meaning of \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" makes it similar to shalom in Hebrew, sal\u0101m in Arabic, annyeong in Korean, aloha in Hawaiian, drud (bedrud) in Persian, and ch\u00e0o in Vietnamese (the latter is a false cognate; the two words are not linguistically related despite sounding similar to each other)."

        "content": "The word derives from the Venetian phrase s-ci\u00e0o vostro or s-ci\u00e0o su, literally meaning \"(I am) your slave\". This greeting is analogous to the medieval Latin servus which is still used colloquially in parts of Central/Eastern Europe, or the antiquated English valediction Your Obedient Servant. The expression was not a literal statement of fact, but rather a perfunctory promise of good will among friends (along the lines of \"at your service\" in English). The Venetian word for \"slave\", s-ci\u00e0o [\u02c8st\u0283ao] or s-ci\u00e0vo, derives from Medieval Latin sclavus, a loanword from Medieval Greek \u03a3\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, related to the ethnic \"Slavic\", since most of the slaves at that time came from the Balkans.This greeting was eventually shortened to ci\u00e0o, lost all its servile connotations and came to be used as an informal salutation by speakers of all classes.  In modern Italian language, the word is used (in addition to the meaning of salutation) as an exclamation of resignation (also in a positive sense), as in Oh, va be', ciao! (\"Oh, well, never mind!\"). A Milanese tongue-twister says Se gh'hinn gh'hinn; se gh'hinn n\u00f2, s'ci\u00e0o (\"If there is [money], there is; if there isn't, farewell! [there's nothing we can do]\")."

It has since spread to many countries in Europe, along with other items of the Italian culture. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the greeting (spelled chau and only meaning 'bye') spread to the Americas\u2014especially Colombia, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Brazil (as tchau), Venezuela, Panama and Argentina \u2013 largely by way of Italian immigrants. In today's Cuba, ciao as a closing in letters has largely replaced the more traditional adi\u00f3s, with its religious implications, for many young people. Ciao has also permeated Australian culture, becoming a popular greeting among descendants of Italian immigrants. It is also common in some varieties of South African English. Ciao has also been used in some parts of Romania as a way to say 'goodbye'.\nErnest Hemingway's novel A Farewell to Arms (1929), which is set in northeast Italy during World War I, is credited with bringing the word into the English language."

In Italy, ciao is mainly used in informal contexts, i.e. among family members, relatives, and friends, in other words, with those one would address with the familiar tu (second person singular) as opposed to Lei (courtesy form); in these contexts, ciao can be the norm even as a morning or evening salutation, in lieu of buon giorno or buona sera, deemed too formal among friends, relatives, or the very familiar. \nIn other languages, ciao has come to have more specific meanings.

        "content": "The title is a reference to a nameless black Labrador Retriever the band used to see wandering the Headley Grange studio grounds. The dog would disappear in the evening and return exhausted in the early morning, before resting all day and repeating his evening sojourns. Robert Plant believed the lab was spending nights with his \"old lady\" (dog). Likewise the lyrics are narrated by a man obsessed with a woman, \"got a flaming heart can't get my fill\", he \"can't keep away\" from her \"honey drip\"; she reveals her true intention, spending his money, taking his car, \"telling her friends she's gonna be a star\", at which point the deception becomes clear and he turns cold, saying \"a big-legged woman ain't got no soul\".  The story of lust, eroticism, and ultimately betrayal echoes the traditional reputation of the blues as being the music of the devil, alluded to in the lyric \"eyes that shine a burning red\".The song opens with muted sounds of guitars warming up in the background, an idea by Jimmy Page, who also made curious opening sounds in \"Immigrant Song\" and \"Friends\", he was fond of starting songs in an unexpected way. The sounds are actually recordings of various guitar track openings played simultaneously, creating a \"sonic collage\" in which the tape can be heard spinning up to speed. Robert Plant then begins singing in a high strong voice, \"Hey Hey Mama..\" unaccompanied by music (a cappella). This sets the structure of the song, around a call and response dynamic, between the vocalist and the band, back and forth. It was Jimmy Page's idea to start and stop the music, and he was inspired by Fleetwood Mac's 1969 song \"Oh Well\".Bassist John Paul Jones, who is credited with writing the main riff, said he was inspired by Muddy Waters' controversial 1968 album Electric Mud.  However he retracted this, in 2007, saying that he was confused, and that his main inspiration was actually The Howlin' Wolf Album by Howlin' Wolf, particularly the repeating riff in \"Smokestack Lightning\". Jones and Page worked to refine the riff.\nJones added complex rhythm changes, that biographer Keith Shadwick describes as a \"clever pattern that turns back on itself more than once, crossing between time signatures as it does.\" The group had a difficult time with the turnaround, but drummer John Bonham's solution was to play it straight through as if there was no turnaround.  As Jean-Michel Guesdon notes, the recording contains rhythmic coordination errors, such as between 0:41 and 0:47, when the guitars are not in sync with the drums. He says it was part of the band's \"genius\" to discount these \"errors\" as \"curiosities\" ie. characteristic signatures of the song. In live performances, Bonham eliminated the 54 variation so that Robert Plant could perform his a cappella vocal interludes and then have the instruments return at the proper time.For his guitar parts, Jimmy Page used a Gibson Les Paul and made a complicated series of overdubs through various compressors and other equipment. There was so much distortion, Page later said it sounded like an analog synthesizer."

Use Your Illusion I featured several songs pre-Appetite for Destruction while Use Your Illusion II featured more tracks written during and after Appetite for Destruction.\nThe band's cover of \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" had been released almost a year earlier on the Days of Thunder soundtrack, while \"Civil War\" debuted at the 1990 Farm Aid concert. That concert also featured Guns N' Roses playing a cover of the U.K. Subs song \"Down on the Farm\", a studio version of which would later appear on the band's 1993 release of cover songs, \"The Spaghetti Incident?\". \"Civil War\" was released as a B-side to \"You Could Be Mine\". The song had also been released on the charity album Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal, a fund-raising compilation for Romanian orphans.\n\"You Could Be Mine\" was released in June 1991 and is featured in the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The song was not released on the actual soundtrack. The band also filmed a video featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in character as the Terminator, with a loose plot featuring Axl Rose as its \"target\". However, he is saved from termination as he is deemed a \"waste of ammo\" by the T-800's lock-on system. The original subject matter of the song dealt with Izzy Stradlin's failed relationship with ex-girlfriend Angela Nicoletti.\nThe Use Your Illusion albums can be considered a single cohesive work, and certain elements of Use Your Illusion II underscore this intent. For instance, both albums have a version of the song \"Don't Cry\", and both have one cover song; \"Live and Let Die\" by Paul McCartney (Use Your Illusion I) and \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" by Bob Dylan (Use Your Illusion II). Each also has at least one track sung by other members of the band: lead vocals are performed by bassist Duff McKagan on \"So Fine\", a song that was dedicated to punk rock musician Johnny Thunders, who died from a drug overdose before the recording of the album.The song \"Get in the Ring\" finds the band lashing out at a career's worth of critics and enemies. Among those referred to by name are editors of several entertainment magazines. The industrial flavored \"My World\", the final track, was written and recorded in three hours, with Rose claiming those in the recording room were on mushrooms at the time.The band had some difficulty achieving the final sound, especially during the mixing stages of both albums. According to a 1991 cover story by Rolling Stone magazine, after mixing 21 tracks with engineer/producer Bob Clearmountain, the band fired Clearmountain when he tried to replace the real drums with samples. According to Slash's autobiography, \"one afternoon we discovered a notepad of his where he'd notated all the drum samples he planned to mix in over Matt's drum tracks\" the band decided to scrap the mixes and start from scratch with engineer Bill Price of Sex Pistols fame.Slash has stated that most of the material for the album was written on acoustic guitars in a couple of nights at his house (the Walnut House), after several months of non-productivity. According to Slash \"Breakdown\" was one of the most complicated songs to record on the album; the banjo, drum, and piano parts were hard to synchronize and drummer Matt Sorum \"lost it\" a couple of times trying to get the drums just right. The song \"Locomotive\" was written in a house Slash and Izzy Stradlin rented in the Hollywood Hills following the Appetite for Destruction tours. The song shows the group dabbling in funk metal, and is also the only song on either album where the phrase \"use your illusion\" appears as a lyric."

Rolling Stone critic Christian Wright wrote that the album's songs \"range from ballad to battle, pretty to vulgar, worldly to incredibly naive\", concluding that Rose \"whips victimization, menace and struggle into one fluid, triumphant motion.\" Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that both Use Your Illusion albums \"represent a staggering leap in ambition, musicianship, production and songwriting\" and \"rank with the best hard rock of the last decade\", while also finding that II contains more \"knockout punches\" than I. Although deeming I the better record, USA Today's Edna Gundersen called II similarly \"rebellious, ambitious and powerful\". In NME, Mary Anne Hobbs panned both albums for their \"dreadfully laboured feel\" and \"asinine\" lyrics; as examples of the latter, she cited the \"gratuitous sexism\" of \"Pretty Tied Up\" and \"slack political rhetoric\" of \"Civil War\". Robert Christgau was unimpressed by II apart from \"Civil War\", which he designated as a \"choice cut\" in The Village Voice.In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Use Your Illusion II as \"more serious and ambitious than I, but ... also considerably more pretentious\", finding it a tedious listen due to its \"pompous production and poor pacing\" despite commending the \"nervy energy\" of certain songs. Ann Powers was more complimentary in the 2004 Rolling Stone Album Guide, calling it \"spacier\" than I while noting that \"Yesterdays\" and \"You Could Be Mine\" show that Guns N' Roses \"can still focus to great effect\". Both Use Your Illusion records were jointly ranked 41st on Rolling Stone's 2010 list of the best albums of the 1990s.It was the first time that two albums by one band or artist had entered the US charts at the number one and two spots and Guns N' Roses became the first to have the top two biggest selling albums on the chart since Jim Croce in 1974. The albums also opened as the top two albums on the charts in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom."

For example, the song \"In Every Dream Home a Heartache\" (Ferry's sinister ode to a blow-up doll) fades out in its closing section, only to fade in again with all the instruments subjected to a pronounced phasing treatment. The title track fades out in an elaborate blend of tape loop effects. Brian Eno remarked that the eerie \"The Bogus Man\", with lyrics about a sexual stalker, displayed similarities with contemporary material by the krautrock group Can.Of the more upbeat numbers on the album, \"Do the Strand\" and \"Editions of You\" are both based around rhythms in the tradition of the band's first single \"Virginia Plain\". \"Do the Strand\" has been called the archetypal Roxy Music anthem, whilst \"Editions of You\" is notable for a series of solos by Andy Mackay (saxophone), Eno (VCS3), and Phil Manzanera (guitar).\nEno is prominent in the final song \"For Your Pleasure\" from the album, making it unlike any other song on the album. The song ends with the voice of Judi Dench saying \"You don't ask. You don't ask why\" amid tapes of the opening vocals ('Well, how are you?') from \"Chance Meeting\" from the first Roxy Music album. A live recording of the song was used in 1975 as a B-side to \"Both Ends Burning\".\nThe original UK LP cover credits \"Produced by Chris Thomas and Roxy Music\" for the entire album, but only the side one label repeats that; the side two label credits \"Produced by John Anthony and Roxy Music\".

With their producer, Nigel Godrich, Radiohead recorded most of OK Computer in their rehearsal space in Oxfordshire and the historic mansion of St Catherine's Court in Bath in 1996 and early 1997. They distanced themselves from the guitar-centred, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computer's abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and eclectic influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work.\nThe album's lyrics depict a dystopian, futuristic world fraught with rampant consumerism, capitalism, social and modern alienation, emotional isolation and political malaise, with overall themes like transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism; in this capacity, OK Computer is said to have prescient insight into the mood of 21st-century life. The band used unconventional production techniques, including natural reverberation, and no audio separation. Strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. Most of the album was recorded live.\nDespite lowered sales estimates by EMI, who deemed the record uncommercial and difficult to market, OK Computer reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and debuted at number 21 on the Billboard 200, Radiohead's highest album entry on the US charts at the time, and was soon certified five times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. \"Paranoid Android\", \"Karma Police\", \"Lucky\" and \"No Surprises\" were released as singles. The album expanded Radiohead's international popularity and has sold at least 7.8 million units worldwide.\nOK Computer received acclaim and has been cited as one of the greatest albums of all time. It was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Alternative Music Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards. It was also nominated for Best British Album at the 1998 Brit Awards. The album initiated a stylistic shift in British rock away from Britpop toward melancholic, atmospheric alternative rock that became more prevalent in the next decade. In 2014, it was included by the United States Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". A remastered version with additional tracks, OKNOTOK 1997 2017, was released in 2017, marking the album's twentieth anniversary. In 2019, in response to an internet leak, Radiohead released MiniDiscs [Hacked], comprising hours of additional material."

Midway through the tour, Brian Eno commissioned them to contribute a song to The Help Album, a charity compilation organised by War Child; the album was to be recorded over the course of a single day, 4 September 1995, and rush-released that week. Radiohead recorded \"Lucky\" in five hours with Nigel Godrich, who had engineered The Bends and produced several Radiohead B-sides. Godrich said of the session: \"Those things are the most inspiring, when you do stuff really fast and there's nothing to lose. We left feeling fairly euphoric. So after establishing a bit of a rapport work-wise, I was sort of hoping I would be involved with the next album.\" The singer, Thom Yorke, said \"Lucky\" shaped the nascent sound and mood of their upcoming record: \"'Lucky' was indicative of what we wanted to do. It was like the first mark on the wall.\"Radiohead found touring stressful and took a break in January 1996. They sought to move away from the introspective style of The Bends. The drummer, Philip Selway, said: \"There was an awful lot of soul-searching [on The Bends]. To do that again on another album would be excruciatingly boring.\" Yorke said he did not want to do \"another miserable, morbid and negative record\", and was \"writing down all the positive things that I hear or see. I'm not able to put them into music yet and I don't want to just force it.\"The critical and commercial success of The Bends gave Radiohead the confidence to self-produce their third album. Their label Parlophone gave them a \u00a3100,000 budget for recording equipment. The lead guitarist, Jonny Greenwood, said \"the only concept that we had for this album was that we wanted to record it away from the city and that we wanted to record it ourselves\". According to the guitarist Ed O'Brien, \"Everyone said, 'You'll sell six or seven million if you bring out The Bends Pt 2,' and we're like, 'We'll kick against that and do the opposite'.\" A number of producers were suggested, including major figures such as Scott Litt, but Radiohead were encouraged by their sessions with Godrich. They consulted him for advice on equipment, and prepared for the sessions by buying their own, including a plate reverberator purchased from the songwriter Jona Lewie. Although Godrich had sought to focus on electronic dance music, he outgrew his role as advisor and became the album's co-producer."

        "content": "In early 1996, Radiohead recorded demos for their third album at Chipping Norton Recording Studios, Oxfordshire. In July, they began rehearsing and recording in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near Didcot, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline that contributed to the stress of The Bends, the band had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: \"We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song ... The stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them.\"The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly \"the loudest voice\", according to O'Brien. Selway said \"we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, but at the same time we are all very critical about what the other person is doing.\" Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead \"need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well ... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility\u2014the term producing a record means taking responsibility for the record ... It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across.\" Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's \"sixth member\", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the \"fifth Beatle\".Radiohead decided that Canned Applause was an unsatisfactory recording location, which Yorke attributed to its proximity to the band members' homes, and Jonny Greenwood attributed to its lack of dining and bathroom facilities. The group had nearly completed four songs: \"Electioneering\", \"No Surprises\", \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" and \"The Tourist\". They took a break from recording to embark on an American tour in 1996, opening for Alanis Morissette, performing early versions of several new songs.During the tour, Baz Luhrmann commissioned Radiohead to write a song for his upcoming film Romeo + Juliet and gave them the final 30 minutes of the film. Yorke said: \"When we saw the scene in which Claire Danes holds the Colt .45 against her head, we started working on the song immediately.\" Soon afterwards, the band wrote and recorded \"Exit Music (For a Film)\"; the track plays over the film's end credits but was excluded from the soundtrack album at the band's request. The song helped shape the direction of the rest of the album. Yorke said it \"was the first performance we'd ever recorded where every note of it made my head spin\u2014something I was proud of, something I could turn up really, really loud and not wince at any moment.\"\nRadiohead resumed recording in September 1996 at St Catherine's Court, a historic mansion near Bath owned by the actress Jane Seymour. It was unoccupied but sometimes used for corporate functions. The change of setting marked an important transition in the recording process. Greenwood, comparing the mansion to previous studio settings, said it \"was less like a laboratory experiment, which is what being in a studio is usually like, and more about a group of people making their first record together\".The band made extensive use of the different rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on \"Exit Music (For a Film)\" feature natural reverberation achieved by recording on a stone staircase, and \"Let Down\" was recorded in a ballroom at 3 a.m. Isolation allowed the band to work at a different pace, with more flexible and spontaneous working hours. O'Brien said that \"the biggest pressure was actually completing [the recording]. We weren't given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted. We were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff.\" Yorke was satisfied with the recordings made at the location, and enjoyed working without audio separation, meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately. O'Brien estimated that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: \"I hate doing overdubs, because it just doesn't feel natural. ... Something special happens when you're playing live; a lot of it is just looking at one another and knowing there are four other people making it happen.\" Many of Yorke's vocals were first takes; he felt that if he made other attempts he would \"start to think about it and it would sound really lame\".Radiohead returned to Canned Applause in October for rehearsals, and completed most of OK Computer in further sessions at St. Catherine's Court. By Christmas, they had narrowed the track listing to 14 songs. The strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London in January 1997. The album was mixed over the next two months at various London studios, then mastered by Chris Blair at Abbey Road. Godrich preferred a quick and \"hands-off\" approach to mixing, and said: \"I feel like I get too into it. I start fiddling with things and I fuck it up ... I generally take about half a day to do a mix. If it's any longer than that, you lose it. The hardest thing is trying to stay fresh, to stay objective.\""

        "content": "The title OK Computer is taken from the 1978 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio series, in which the character Zaphod Beeblebrox speaks the phrase \"Okay, computer, I want full manual control now.\" The members of Radiohead listened to the series on the bus during their 1996 tour and Yorke made a note of the phrase. \"OK Computer\" became a working title for \"Palo Alto\", a B-side for the single \"No Surprises\", which had been considered for inclusion on the album. The title stuck with the band; according to Jonny Greenwood, it \"started attaching itself and creating all these weird resonances with what we were trying to do\".Yorke said the title \"refers to embracing the future, it refers to being terrified of the future, of our future, of everyone else's. It's to do with standing in a room where all these appliances are going off and all these machines and computers and so on ... and the sound it makes.\" He described the title as \"a really resigned, terrified phrase\", to him similar to the Coca-Cola advertisement \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\". Wired writer Leander Kahney suggests that it is an homage to Macintosh computers, as the Mac's speech recognition software responds to the command \"OK computer\" as an alternative to clicking the \"OK\" button. Other titles considered were Ones and Zeroes\u2014a reference to the binary numeral system\u2014and Your Home May Be at Risk If You Do Not Keep Up Payments."

        "content": "The OK Computer artwork is a collage of images and text created by Yorke (credited as the White Chocolate Farm) and Stanley Donwood. Yorke commissioned Donwood to work on a visual diary alongside the recording sessions. He said he did not feel confident in his music until he saw a visual representation to accompany it. According to Donwood, the blue-and-white palette was the result of \"trying to make something the colour of bleached bone\".The image of two stick figures shaking hands appears in the liner notes and on the disc label in CD and LP releases. Yorke said the image symbolised exploitation: \"Someone's being sold something they don't really want, and someone's being friendly because they're trying to sell something. That's what it means to me.\" The image was later used on the cover for Radiohead: The Best Of (2008). Explaining the artwork's themes, Yorke said, \"It's quite sad, and quite funny as well. All the artwork and so on ... It was all the things that I hadn't said in the songs.\"Motifs in the artwork include motorways, aeroplanes, families, corporate logos and cityscapes. The photograph of a motorway on the cover was likely taken in Hartford, Connecticut, where Radiohead performed in 1996. The words \"Lost Child\" feature prominently, and the booklet artwork contains phrases in the constructed language Esperanto and health-related instructions in both English and Greek. The Uncut critic David Cavanagh said the use of non-sequiturs created an effect \"akin to being lifestyle-coached by a lunatic\". White scribbles, Donwood's method of correcting mistakes rather than using the computer function undo, are present everywhere in the collages. The liner notes contain the full lyrics, rendered with atypical syntax, alternate spelling and small annotations. The lyrics are also arranged and spaced in shapes that resemble hidden images. In keeping with Radiohead's emerging anti-corporate stance, the production credits contain the ironic copyright notice \"Lyrics reproduced by kind permission even though we wrote them.\""

        "content": "OK Computer was almost uniformly praised. Critics described it as a landmark release of far-reaching impact and importance, but noted that its experimentalism made it a challenging listen. According to Tim Footman, \"Not since 1967, with the release of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, had so many major critics agreed immediately, not only on an album's merits, but on its long-term significance, and its ability to encapsulate a particular point in history.\" In the British press, the album garnered favourable reviews in NME, Melody Maker, The Guardian and Q. Nick Kent wrote in Mojo that \"Others may end up selling more, but in 20 years' time I'm betting OK Computer will be seen as the key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and song-structures from an earlier era.\" John Harris wrote in Select: \"Every word sounds achingly sincere, every note spewed from the heart, and yet it roots itself firmly in a world of steel, glass, random-access memory and prickly-skinned paranoia.\"The album was well received by critics in North America. Rolling Stone, Spin, the Los Angeles Times, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pitchfork and the Daily Herald published positive reviews. In The New Yorker, Alex Ross praised its progressiveness, and contrasted Radiohead's risk-taking with the musically conservative \"dadrock\" of their contemporaries Oasis. Ross wrote: \"Throughout the album, contrasts of mood and style are extreme ... This band has pulled off one of the great art-pop balancing acts in the history of rock.\" Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork lauded the record's emotional appeal, writing that it \"is brimming with genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once passive and fire-breathing\".Reviews for Entertainment Weekly, the Chicago Tribune, and Time were mixed. Robert Christgau from The Village Voice said Radiohead immersed Yorke's vocals in \"enough electronic marginal distinction to feed a coal town for a month\" to compensate for the \"soulless\" songs, resulting in \"arid\" art rock. In an otherwise positive review, Andy Gill wrote for The Independent: \"For all its ambition and determination to break new ground, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive as The Bends, which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that luxuriates so readily in its own despondency.\""

        "content": "13 is the sixth studio album by English alternative rock band Blur, released on 15 March 1999. Continuing the stylistic shift away from the Britpop sound of the band's early career, 13 explores experimental, psychedelic and electronic music.\nRecording took place from June to October 1998 in London and Reykjav\u00edk. The album marks a departure of the band's longtime producer, Stephen Street, with his role being filled by William Orbit, who they had chosen after the release of the remix album, Bustin' + Dronin' (1998). Relationships between the band members were reported to be strained, with members frequently missing from the sessions. Lyrically, the album is significantly darker and more innovative than Blur's previous efforts, being heavily inspired by Damon Albarn's breakup with long-term girlfriend, Justine Frischmann, which followed an increasingly strained relationship. This album was the last for over a decade to feature the original line-up as Coxon left the band during the sessions of their next album Think Tank (2003), before returning for The Magic Whip (2015).\n13 was released on 15 March 1999 and entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, making it Blur's fourth consecutive studio album to reach the top spot. The album was later certified Platinum. 13 also reached number one in Norway and charted within the top 20 in many other countries. The album produced three singles \u2013 \"Tender\", \"Coffee & TV\" and \"No Distance Left to Run\" \u2013 which charted at number 2, number 11 and number 14 respectively on the UK Singles Chart. 13 met with favourable reviews and received a nomination for the Mercury Prize, as well as for Best Album at the 2000 NME Awards."

        "content": "Blur's previous studio album, Blur (1997), had seen the band move away from the Britpop movement and take on a more alternative rock-influenced direction, primarily under the suggestion of guitarist Graham Coxon. The press and the industry had feared that the change in style would not be taken well with the public, and therefore the album would be commercially unsuccessful as a result. Despite these concerns, Blur was an unexpected success, particularly in America, where the album was certified gold. However, the band still wanted to innovate, so they decided to embrace a different sound. Bassist Alex James stated, \"I think you just have to keep changing. That sort of thinking was, sort of, key.\"The band's leader Damon Albarn had been in a long-term relationship with Justine Frischmann, of the Britpop band Elastica. Their relationship was highly publicised, the couple being described by John Harris as \"proto-Posh and Becks for the indie-rock constituency.\" However, their relationship became strained over time, stated reasons including Albarn's desire to have children as well as Frischmann's continued friendship with ex-boyfriend Brett Anderson of Suede, who had shared a musical rivalry with Albarn. Albarn's lyrics and attitude had reflected this in the eyes of the other band members, with Coxon pointing out, \"I didn't have much of a clue that things were going wrong between Damon and Justine but it was probably easy to guess.\" After one last holiday together in Bali in late 1997 in an attempt to rekindle their relationship, the couple finally split. Albarn later commented, \"That relationship just absolutely crashed. I mean, it really was a spectacularly sad end.\"After his breakup, Albarn started sharing a flat with artist Jamie Hewlett whom he had met through Coxon. Around this time, Albarn had started to broaden his musical output. Whilst he was working on 13, there were various reports that he and Hewlett were working on a secret project, which turned out to be Gorillaz, a virtual band. Albarn also started working on film soundtracks, including Ravenous, Ordinary Decent Criminal and 101 Reykjav\u00edk."

Instead the band \"unanimously\" decided that they wanted electronic music artist William Orbit to produce the album after being impressed by his remix of their track, \"Movin' On\", included on the remix compilation, Bustin' + Dronin' (1998). Albarn commented that \"it was such a personal thing going on, we needed to have someone who didn't really know us\". He also described Orbit as being \"like a psychiatrist\". When asked if his replacement had come as a shock, Street stated, \"I just think they wanted to stretch out a bit more and, having made five albums with me, the best way to do that was to work with someone different who would approach the project in a different way. I understand that perfectly and certainly wasn't offended. I did five albums with the band and I must admit I thought each one would be the last because they were bound to want to try something new.\" Albarn described the decision to not work with Street as \"difficult\", going on to say \"he'll be forever part of what we are, and ironically, he gave us the tools we needed to go it alone.\"Tension in the studio ran high during the recording sessions. In Orbit's words, \"There was a battle between Damon's more experimental direction, and Graham's punk one, and Graham prevailed. If that tension had been growing on previous LPs, it came to a head here.\" \"Things were starting to fall apart between the four of us,\" drummer Dave Rowntree later revealed. \"It was quite a sad process making it. People were not turning up to the sessions, or turning up drunk, being abusive and storming off.\" \"I had songs,\" Alex James remarked. \"I played them to William. He liked them. But I was sulking. I didn't play them to the others... Now I know how George Harrison felt.\" Coxon admitted, \"I was really out there around 13, which made for some pretty great noise but I was probably a bit of a crap to be around.\"\"1992\" had originally been recorded as a demo in 1992 and was lost until Albarn found it again on a tape six years later. \"Mellow Song\" was demoed as a jam session known as \"Mellow Jam\" that was later included as the B-side of \"Tender\"."

The instrumental closer \"Optigan 1\" was created using an Optigan optical organ. The album is in the style of a loose concept album, much like other Blur albums, in this case about life and relationships. Much of the album was inspired by Albarn's breakup with Elastica singer Justine Frischmann.

Infuriating, because divested of four solid-gone clunkers 13 could pass muster as the best of Blur.\" Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honourable mention rating, indicating \"an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure\", and remarked that \"halfway there, it sits down in the middle of the road and won't budge.\"The music video for the hit single \"Coffee & TV\" cemented Blur's reputation as a cult band in the US with its protagonist Milky.

Muchas Flores proved to be a success, selling 250,000 units in Spain, aided by the singer exposure on Talk to Her, a 2002 film by Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Flores also did a small promotional tour in the United States to benefit the album, and a full length worldwide tour, which lasted two years and concluded with the recording of her following album De Mil Colores.Muchas Flores received mixed critical reviews.

The magazine ceased publication following Paz's death in 1998.The magazine published an important group of international intellectuals and writers, from Mexico, Latin America, the United States, and Europe, many of whom Paz met during his remarkable career. These included Carlos Fuentes, Mario Vargas Llosa, Gabriel Zaid, E.M. Cioran, Enrique Krauze, Jorge Luis Borges, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Samuel Beckett, Milan Kundera, Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, Susan Sontag, John Kenneth Galbraith, Leszek Ko\u0142akowski, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Isaiah Berlin, and Reinaldo Arenas, among others.\nPaz published a collection of poems under the title Vuelta, which were written between 1969 and 1974.\nIn 1988, historian Enrique Krauze criticized Carlos Fuentes and his fiction in an article Vuelta, dubbing him a \"guerrilla dandy\" for the perceived gap between his Marxist politics and his personal lifestyle, as well as his long absences from the country he wrote about. This essay contributed to a permanent rift between Paz and Fuentes, formerly close friends, who were also estranged because of Fuentes' support for the Sandinistas.Vuelta received the 1993 Prince of Asturias Award for Communications and Humanities. In the award, Vuelta was described as \"one of the most important cultural phenomena in the Spanish language\"."

The music was written by Aleksandra Pakhmutova, with lyrics by Nikolai Dobronravov and Sergey Grebennikov.\"Tenderness\" was one of the most beloved songs from cosmonaut of the USSR, and the most beloved \u2014 the first cosmonaut of the planet Earth \u2014 Yuri Gagarin. Yevgeny Dolmatovsky recalled in the book \"Stories about your songs\" (1973):\n\"Tenderness\" is like a spell of a woman, a friend of the pilot, who released her beloved to the stars and is waiting for his return. The source of the song is the hour and a half that it took Yuri Gagarin to fly around the globe, the hours and minutes that other cosmonauts and <test-pilot> Georgy Mosolov spent on daring flights. It is not by chance that the poets Grebennikov and Dobronravov remembered Exup\u00e9ry. One of the first to talk ably about the experiences and feelings of a man who has gained wings, this dreamer and warrior, and cosmonauts, including Yuri Gagarin, often told poets: write about Exup\u00e9ry!In order for a song to be born and turned out, many circumstances, impressions, finds are needed. It is important to remember that Yuri Gagarin brought the authors to the song \"Tenderness\". He loved this song very much, sang it together with his comrades, specially went to listen \u2014 so that not on the radio, not on TV, but here, next to it, it sounded.\nNezhnost' was performed in 1967 by Tatiana Doronina (as Nyura) in Tatiana Lioznova's film Tri topolya na Plyushchikhe (Three Poplars at Plyuschikha Street). Originally it was recorded by Maya Kristalinskaya in 1966. According to the memoirs of Chermen Kasaev (music editor of Radio in the Soviet Union and Soviet Central Television), when listening to a final record, Maya had tears dripping from her eyes. B. Serebrennikova wrote in the book \"Singers of Soviet Pop\" (1977) that \"All critics who wrote about \"Tenderness\" noted that this is the pinnacle of Kristalinskaya's art and in general a masterpiece of song performance creativity.\"It was covered many times by many artists in Soviet Union and Russia, including versions made by Yuri Gulyayev, Joseph Kobzon, Tamara Sinyavskaya, Lyudmila Zykina, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Tamara Gverdtsiteli, Maria Codrianu, Latvian singer Olga P\u012br\u0101gs. Also, the song was recorded in 1967 by French singer Frida Boccara in Russian (Soviet album \u00ab\u041f\u043e\u0451\u0442 \u0424\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u043a\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u00bb / Frida Boccara sings, Melodiya), in 1969 by Cuban singer Lourdes Gil and Francis Goya (as Tenderness \u2014 CD album A Tribute... With My Sincere Admiration for Alexandra Pakhmutova, 2002). The song has been live performed in 1999 by Alla Bayanova in French, accompanied by Mikhail Pletnev.Several Western arrangements of the tune are known under the title Tenderness. These include a version in both English and Russian by Jason Kouchak  and in particular, Marc Almond's version which is known for his live performance at the Manege of the First Cadet Corps (Saint Petersburg) on October 1, 2008  and Thomas Anders' version is known for his live performance at the Kremlin Palace on April 23, 2009."

Feeling sick one day, George Harrison was prescribed tonic and bed rest by a doctor. With nothing to do in his room at the Palace Court Hotel, he began writing a song, recording himself on a portable tape recorder. The surviving recording includes him working on the bridge and whistling through the song's melody, likely because the song did not yet have lyrics.Besides the 1958 song \u201cIn Spite of All The Danger\u201d \u2013 co-written with McCartney, and the 1961 instrumental \"Cry for a Shadow\" \u2013 co-written as Lennon\u2013Harrison, \"Don't Bother Me\" was Harrison's first composition. Liverpool journalist Bill Harry claims that he encouraged Harrison to write a new song, and that Harrison's response of \"Don't bother me\" served as inspiration for the song's title. In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison describes the song \"as an exercise to see if I could write a song. ... I was sick in bed \u2013 maybe that's why it turned out to be Don't Bother Me.\" Published by the Dick James\u2013Brian Epstein partnership, Jaep Music, this predated the five-year contract Harrison signed with Northern Songs on 9 November 1963.After \"Don't Bother Me\", it was not until 1965's Help! album that any more Harrison-penned songs (\"I Need You\" and \"You Like Me Too Much\") would appear on record. \"You Know What to Do\" - another song by Harrison - was recorded in 1964, but was not released at the time."

Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes the results were deemed unsatisfactory, while Beatles writer John C. Winn writes the band ran out of time during their slated recording time. Returning to the studio the next day, the band remade the song from 7:00\u201311:30 pm, designating the first take as \"take 10\". George Martin produced, assisted by engineers Norman Smith and Richard Langham. Harrison sings lead vocal and plays the guitar solo on all tracks, complaining between takes about the difficulty this adds to performing. Lennon plays rhythm guitar, trying to achieve a \"dirty\" sound on early takes by raising the signal gain on his Rickenbacker 325 Capri. Martin was unsatisfied with the effect and suggested the use of a compressor to flatten the guitar's dynamic range and achieve the desired \"organ sound\". Lennon's amp provides a tremolo effect, resulting in a more \"sinister\" sound in the refrain and bridge, similar to the timbre heard in songs by the Shadows. Take 13 was deemed best, allowing the band to proceed with overdubbing. Harrison records another vocal, double tracking his original, while McCartney plays claves, Lennon the tambourine and Starr an Arabian bongo. Recording concludes with take 19, the overdub of take 15 onto take 13 deemed \"best\".Martin, Smith and Geoff Emerick mixed the track for mono on 30 September, then for stereo on 29 October. Another engineer assisted with stereo mixing, unidentified besides the initials \"B. T.\" The stereo mix includes the end of \"four\" from Harrison's \"one-two-three-four\" count-in."

Ian MacDonald writes reception to the song has generally been poor, with even Harrison himself subsequently discounting it. In I, Me, Mine, Harrison writes \"I don't think it's a particularly good song... It mightn't even be a song at all, but at least it showed me that all I needed to do was keep on writing, and then maybe eventually I would write something good.\" Tim Riley describes it as a weak songwriting debut and demonstrates the strength of the Beatles as a group that they \"find a groove in this tune despite its flaws.\" Mark Hertsgaard was more favourable to the song, describing it as one of the best on With the Beatles and \"a promising premiere\".Everett describes the song as a watershed moment, being the first time a guitar tone was manipulated electronically. The contrasting timbres of the guitars are unique among the songs on Please Please Me and With the Beatles, going beyond their \"typical homogeneity of sound\". He writes that \"Don't Bother Me\" and the later \"Baby's in Black\" presage the band's subsequent work, such as the feedback heard on \"It's All Too Much\".The song is heard in the Beatles 1964 film A Hard Day's Night. Along with other earlier numbers played in the film \u2013 \"She Loves You\", \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" and \"All My Loving\" \u2013 United Artists originally planned to include the song on the North American soundtrack album.

The name Hacker is derived from the medieval given names Hack or Hake. These English names are derivatives of the Old Norse name Haki, which is a cognate of the English name Hook. The name Haket de Ridefort was recorded in Lincolnshire in the year 1160. The name can also be found in poll tax records in Yorkshire dating back to 1158 and the name 'Hake' is still popular in Yorkshire as well. The name was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as 'Hako'. The name 'Haket' was also recorded in 1160 in Lincolnshire and the name 'Hacke' was recorded in England in 1218. Another possible origin of the name is that it derives from the Middle English word 'haket', a kind of fish. This suggests that the name could've been an occupational name for fisherman. Mabil Hacket was recorded in the Hundred Rolls in 1273.Hackett is a common surname in the Midlands region. The village Cofton Hackett in Worcestershire is named after William de Haket, who held land there around 1166. The name is particularly common in Warwickshire ranking as the 140th most common surname in the county, as well as Staffordshire (194th), and Northamptonshire (200th). Outside of the Midlands, the name is also popular in the East of England being the 161st most common surname in Suffolk and the 250th most common surname in Cambridgeshire, as well as being popular in South East England. The name is the 149th most commons surname in East Sussex and the 208th most common name in Buckinghamshire.\nMany Hacketts in Ireland were English Protestants and were prominent members of society during the Protestant Ascendancy. Several Hacketts and Hakets appear in the lists of sheriffs of Counties Tipperary and Waterford and as members of parliament for Fethard up through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Notable examples include Sir Thomas Hackett who was Lord Mayor of Dublin, Thomas Hacket  an Anglican bishop who was educated at Trinity College Dublin in the 1600s, Sir John Winthrop Hackett a prominent  newspaper proprietor, politician and university chancellor and various Hacketts who were members of the Parliament of Ireland.\nThe Hackett name first migrated to Ireland at the time of the Anglo-Norman invasion in 1170. Members of the Hackett family accompanied Richard \"Strongbow\" de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke during his invasion of Ireland. The Hacketts were subsequently granted estates in the modern counties of Kilkenny, Carlow and Kildare and thus became the principal holders of land and one of the most influential families in Ireland. As a result, several towns have taken the Hackett name, including Hacketstown, in County Carlow.  Further, the Fiants of Henry VIII and Edward VI indicate that in the sixteenth century there were also Hacketstowns, or Ballyhackett, in Counties Dublin and Kildare.\nA branch of the Hacketts moved into Connacht, where, in due course, they became hibernicized and, like other Norman families of that province, formed a distinct if small sept which was known as MacHackett, their seat being Castle Hackett, six miles south-east of Tuam. Yet, in modern times, there has been little trace of the name Hackett in Connacht or usage of the name MacHackett in general. The Hackett name is still strong, however, in and around Counties Tipperary and Kilkenny."

His arms were three hake fish haurient in fesse and in chief three trefoils slipped proper, however the coloring is unknown.\nAnother Coat of Arms was granted to Sir Thomas Hackett, descended from an ancient family long settled in Ireland and Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1688. The coat of arms bore \"the splendid blazon of a field gules thereon three hakes argent haurient in fesse, on a chief or three trefoils slipped proper. The crest being, out of a mural coronet argent, an eagle displayed with two heads sable, with the motto; Spec mea Deus\". Translated, this reads \"On a red shield are three silver hake fish (a pun on the name Hackett) on the top fourth (Chief) are three shamrocks on a gold background. A double eagle wearing a tiara perched on two snakes, while a motto reads \"God is my Hope\". Other mottos include \"Virtue and Fidelity.\", \"All for now, men!\" and \"Fortitudine et prudentia\" (With fortitude and prudence) the later believed to be from Hackett's originating in the Carlow, Kilkenny, and Wexford areas.\nMost of the official coats of arms granted to individual Hacketts are a variant of the one granted to Sir Thomas Hackett."

It was produced by Dave Mustaine and Andy Sneap and released through Roadrunner Records on September 15, 2009.

Two singles were released from the album: \"Head Crusher\" and \"The Right to Go Insane\"; the former was nominated for \"Best Metal Performance\" at the 2010 Grammy Awards. Endgame entered the Billboard 200 at number nine, and reached number one on the U.S. Top Hard Rock Albums chart.  As of April 2011 it has sold about 150,000 copies in the U.S. The album received positive reviews from music critics, and was thought to continue the success of the band's previous album, United Abominations (2007). In 2009, it won two Metal Storm Awards: Best Thrash Metal Album and Biggest Surprise. It was also awarded Best Album in Burrn! magazine's 2009 Readers' Poll."

The first preview from Endgame was a six-minute video featuring Sneap describing the process of mixing \"Head Crusher\" at his studio in Derbyshire, England. In the video, he called the upcoming album \"old-school\". Endgame was recorded at the band's studio, \"Vic's Garage\", in San Marcos, California. The track listing was initially revealed on July 2, 2009, although several track titles were later shortened for the final release. The album was produced by Andy Sneap, who also produced Megadeth's previous album, United Abominations.Mustaine said of the album: \"It is fast, it is heavy, there is singing, yelling, speaking, and guest voices (maybe not singing \u2013 more like in \"Captive Honour\"), the soloing is insane.\" He described it as a riff-oriented album, less melodic than the band's mid-to-late 90s material. Mustaine had saved a number of old rehearsal tapes, which were used as the album's starting point. The band members had online chats with fans on their website while recording, which according to Mustaine, helped lift the band's enthusiasm."

A week after its release, the album had sold 45,000 copies in the United States and 8,200 copies in Canada, debuting at number nine on the Billboard 200, one place lower than the debut of United Abominations in 2007.

With its furious back-and-forth solos, opening instrumental 'Dialectic Chaos' wastes no time in showcasing that dynamic between Mustaine and Broderick, and combined with the pure speed of 'This Day We Fight!', longtime fans will be instantly reminded of the bracing 'Into the Lungs of Hell'/'Set the World Afire' one-two punch that kicks off 1988's great So Far, So Good... So What!.\" Mark Eglinton of The Quietus described the album as \"a return to form\" for Megadeth. Rock guitarist Slash gave a favorable review to Endgame via Twitter.Endgame has since been regarded as a high point of the band's later career. It follows upon two well-received predecessors, while the band started to change its musical direction on the following two albums. In 2013, WhatCulture included Endgame as number five on its \"Top 5 Megadeth albums\" list, behind Killing is My Business... and Business is Good!."

        "content": "Spirit of Eden is the fourth studio album by English band Talk Talk, released in 1988 on Parlophone Records. The songs were written by singer Mark Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene and the album was compiled from a lengthy recording process at London's Wessex Studios between 1987 and 1988. Often working in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances that drew on elements of jazz, ambient, blues, classical music, and dub. These long-form recordings were then heavily edited and re-arranged into an album in mostly digital format.\nSpirit of Eden was a radical departure from Talk Talk's earlier and more accessible albums. Compared to the success of 1986's The Colour of Spring, it was a commercial disappointment. Despite its mixed reception, the album's stature grew more favourable in subsequent years, with contemporary critics describing Spirit of Eden as an underrated masterpiece, and early progenitor of the post-rock genre. In 2013, NME ranked Spirit of Eden at number 95 in its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", and in 2020, the same publication included Spirit of Eden on its list of \"The best new wave albums ever\"."

        "content": "Talk Talk, led by singer Mark Hollis, formed in England in the early 1980s. From the start, Hollis cited jazz and impressionist artists like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Claude Debussy as major influences, but the first two Talk Talk albums, The Party's Over (1982) and It's My Life (1984), did not readily reflect such influences; critics compared the band to contemporary new wave groups, especially Duran Duran. Hollis partly attributed the shortcomings of their early music to a financial need to use synthesizers in place of acoustic instruments.\nAlthough critics did not favour the band's early output, the first two albums were commercially successful in Europe. This gave Talk Talk the money needed to hire additional musicians to play on their next album, The Colour of Spring (1986). The band no longer had to rely on synthesizers. Instead, musicians improvised with their instruments for many hours, then Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene edited and arranged the performances to get the sound they wanted. A total of sixteen musicians appeared on the album around the core of Hollis and Friese-Greene. The Colour of Spring became Talk Talk's most successful album, selling over two million copies and prompting a major world tour. At the same time, minimalist songs like \"April 5th,\" \"Chameleon Day,\" and the B-side \"It's Getting Late in the Evening\" pointed towards the band's next direction."

After listening to the cassette, EMI representatives doubted that it could be commercially successful. They asked Hollis to re-record a song or replace material, but he refused to do so. By the time the masters were delivered later in the month, however, the label conceded that the album had been satisfactorily completed.Despite their reservations towards Spirit of Eden, EMI chose to exercise their option to extend the recording contract. The band, however, wanted out of the contract. \"I knew by that time that EMI was not the company this band should be with,\" manager Keith Aspden told Mojo. \"I was fearful that the money wouldn't be there to record another album.\" EMI and Talk Talk went to court to decide the issue.The case centred on whether EMI had notified the band in time about the contract extension. As part of the agreement, EMI had to send a written notice within three months after the completion of Spirit of Eden. The band said that EMI had sent the notice too late, arguing that the three-month period began once recording had finished; EMI argued that the three-month period did not begin until they were satisfied with the recording, on the basis that the definition of an \"album\" in the contract provided that the album had to be \"commercially satisfactory\". The band disputed this, particularly on the basis that there were no changes made to the album in the space between its recording and eventual release. Justice Andrew Morritt ruled in favour of EMI, but his decision was overturned in the Court of Appeal. Talk Talk were released from the contract and later signed to Polydor."

They're not so much difficult as not obvious. You've just got to find as many ways as possible to expose the music.\" Evaluating some masterpieces of the eighties in a 2004 article for The Guardian, John Robinson calls Spirit of Eden, like David Sylvian's Brilliant Trees, \"triumphant, [but] completely unmarketable.\"Although the band did not originally plan to release a single, EMI issued a radio edit of \"I Believe in You\" in September 1988 (the previously unreleased \"John Cope\" was included as the B-side). The single failed to breach the UK Singles Chart Top 75. Around August, Tim Pope directed a music video for \"I Believe in You\", featuring Hollis sitting with his guitar, singing the lyrics. \"That was a massive mistake,\" said Hollis. \"I thought just by sitting there and listening and really thinking about what it was about, I could get that in my eyes. But you cannot do it. It just feels stupid.\"The band did not tour in support of the album. Hollis explained, \"There is no way that I could ever play again a lot of the stuff I played on this album because I just wouldn't know how to. So, to play it live, to take a part that was done in spontaneity, to write it down and then get someone to play it, would lose the whole point, lose the whole purity of what it was in the first place.\" The band would never tour again.\nSpirit of Eden was released worldwide in 1988. It did not enjoy nearly as much commercial success as The Colour of Spring. The album spent five weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 19.

Among contemporary reviews of Spirit of Eden, Record Mirror's Betty Page commented that Talk Talk had become \"a law unto themselves, unconstrained by narrow ideas of 'what will sell'\", while Q's Mark Cooper likened the album to \"the pastoral epics of the early 70s\" and noted \"a range, ambition and self-sufficiency that enables Hollis and co to step out of time and into their own.\" \"No hit singles then\", the latter wrote, \"but a brave record that is not afraid to follow its own muse and damn the consequences.\" In Sounds, Roy Wilkinson said that Talk Talk had \"evolved into contemplative muso-techs\", and while finding their lyrics occasionally awkward and the album's second half not at the level of the first's \"magnificence\", he deemed Spirit of Eden as a whole \"uncommonly beautiful.\" Simon Williams began his review for NME with a joking dismissal of the album as an exercise in \"conceptualism\", before going on to describe the band as \"resolute and determined\" in their flouting of \"commercial rules with fascinating disregard for understanding or acceptance.\"In the 1992 Rolling Stone Album Guide, J. D. Considine rated Spirit of Eden one star out of five: \"Instead of getting better or worse, this band simply grew more pretentious with each passing year ... by Spirit of Eden, Mark Hollis's Pete Townshend-on-Dramamine vocals have been pushed aside by the band's pointless noodling.\" Marcus Berkmann of The Spectator in a 2001 retrospective felt that the album was \"almost wilfully obscure\", with a musical style close to free-form jazz that was too far removed from The Colour of Spring for fans to enjoy.Spirit of Eden has received more unanimous acclaim in the decades following its release. AllMusic reviewer Jason Ankeny considered the album, in its eschewing of \"electronics for live, organic sounds\" and of \"structure in favor of mood and atmosphere\", an \"unprecedented breakthrough\". Mojo's Danny Eccleston wrote in 2012 that \"there will never be another album like it, since the demise of the profligate old-school record industry means that no one will ever spend so much money making anything so left-field again.\" In a 2019 review, Jeremy D. Larson of Pitchfork lauded the record as a masterful achievement in contemporary music, stating that \"Spirit of Eden was the great inhale of religious feeling, one rock and pop music had been expelling for years and years. The thrill and stasis of a held breath carry the album from beginning to end.\""

In a review of Bark Psychosis' album Hex, where the term \"post-rock\" was coined, Simon Reynolds opined that Hex aspires to the \"baroque grandeur\" of Spirit of Eden. Andy Whitman of Paste magazine argued that Spirit of Eden represents the beginning of post-rock: \"The telltale marks of the genre\u2014textured guitars, glacial tempos, an emphasis on dynamics, electronica, ambience and minimalism\u2014were all in place, and paved the way for bands like Sigur R\u00f3s, Mogwai, Godspeed You!

Numerous bands and artists, including Graham Coxon, Doves, Elbow and Bedhead, have praised Spirit of Eden or have cited it as an influence.\nIn 2008 Alan McGee wrote: \"Spirit of Eden has not dated; it's remarkable how contemporary it sounds, anticipating post-rock, The Verve and Radiohead. It's the sound of an artist being given the keys to the kingdom and returning with art.\"Mark Lager, writing about the album on its 30th anniversary in September 2018 for PopMatters, similarly stated that Spirit of Eden \"influenced and inspired the three most experimental and innovative albums of the 1990s: Lazer Guided Melodies (Spiritualized), A Storm in Heaven (The Verve), and Hex (Bark Psychosis). All three albums followed its patterns of dynamic intensity, free jazz improvisations, and spaces of silence.\"Spirit of Eden was voted number 419 in the 2000 edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2006, Q placed Spirit of Eden at number 31 in its list of the \"40 Best Albums of the '80s\" and in 2013, NME ranked the record at number 95 in its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\"."

Today, the name is found throughout the world as a consequence of large scale emigration from Scotland from the 18th century onwards and the settlement of the Scottish diaspora in many countries particularly the United States, Canada and Australia.\nToday, with about 181,000 namesakes Hall is the 17th most popular surname in England and Wales. Around the world Halls are most common in Melbourne (one in 582 families), Canberra (one in 590) and Sydney (one in 601). The United States has more Halls than the entire population of Bristol-an estimated total of just over 494,000 makes this their 24th most popular surname."

        "content": "Gallagher is an Irish surname. It originates from the Irish noble Gallagher family of County Donegal, Ireland. In Ireland, the anglicized version of the name \"Gallagher\" is pronounced /\u02c8\u0261\u0252l\u0259\u02cch\u0259r/ in County Donegal in Ulster, while elsewhere in the country it is most frequently pronounced as /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6l\u0259\u02cch\u0259r/. Outside Ireland, the pronunciation is often altered to /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6l\u0259\u02cc\u0261\u0259r/ in Britain and the USA. The name Gallagher is an anglicization of the Irish surname \u00d3 Gallchobhair, \u00d3 Gallchobhoir (or two alternative spelling forms, \u00d3 Gallch\u00f3ir and \u00d3 Gallach\u00f3ir), these being masculine forms; the corresponding feminine forms are N\u00ed Ghallchobhair (newer forms N\u00ed Ghallch\u00f3ir and N\u00ed Ghallach\u00f3ir). At least 30 recorded alternate variants exist, including O'Gallagher, Gallacher, Gallager, Gallaher, Gallocher, Galliher, Gollaher, Gollihar and Gallahue.\nThe earliest recorded incidence of the name is in a fragment of a manuscript currently in the Royal Library of Brussels, which states the name \"Gallchubhair\". A similarly earlier mention occurs in the Annals of the Four Masters, where it is recorded that Mael Cobo \u00dai Gallchobhar, Abbot of Scrin Adamnain, died in 1022 AD. Gallchobhar was the one given the role of founding father of the clan at the advent of widespread surname usage in Ireland, which began around the 10th century.\nAs with other modern Irish last names, \u00d3 Gallch\u00f3ir similarly appears to be a conjoined compound word.\nMost Gallaghers are found in the Americas, where approximately 60% of Gallaghers originate. The United States is the home to 55% of Gallaghers. Gallagher is also the most common surname in County Donegal (D\u00fan na nGall means \"fort of the foreigner\"), and thus is very common in Derry, and is the fourteenth-most-common by birth records in Ireland. In the United States, it was ranked by the 2020 US Census as the 482nd most common name.  According to Professor Edward MacLysaght, in the mid-20th century Gallagher was one of the most common Irish surnames, most of the recorded births being located in the northern province, Ulster, and the western province, Connacht, with the majority being recorded in the homeland of the sept\u2014County Donegal in Ulster. In 1890 it was ranked the 12th-most-common surname in Ireland, while in 1996 it was 20th."

He was forced to abruptly abandon it 1837 after being arrested for his controversial poem \"Death of the Poet\", and later opted against finishing it. On June 8, 1838, in a letter to his friend Svyatoslav Rayevsky he wrote: \"The novel that we've started stalked and will hardly get another start, for the circumstances that formed its background changed, and you know, I won't go against the truth.\" Rayevsky was by no means a co-author: he was only writing down what Lermontov was dictating him.Most of the characters of Princess Ligovskaya had their real prototypes. Varvara Lopukhina (whom Lermontov was in love with) featured as Vera, her husband Nikolai Bakhmetyev as Prince Ligovskoy. In Elizaveta Negurova the author portrayed Yekaterina Sushkova, whom he's had an uneasy relationship with, described in full detail in his 1835 letter to cousin Alexandra Vereshchagina.Critics noticed that Pechorin bears strong resemblance to Lermontov. On the other hand, there are obvious parallels to Alexander Pushkin's Yevgeny Onegin (both heroes' second names are derived from the names of rivers Pechora and Onega).\n\n\n== References =="

It marked Harris's first album where he does not regularly provide vocals on each song, instead producing the music and having guest singers sing for him, as Harris stated in late 2010 he did not intend to sing on his songs anymore. The album also shows a shift from Harris' usual nu disco-style songs, focusing more on an electro house style.\n18 Months debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, earning Harris his second consecutive number-one album on the chart. It had sold over 923,000 copies in the United Kingdom as of July 2017. The album includes the singles \"Bounce\", \"Feel So Close\", \"Let's Go\", \"We'll Be Coming Back\", \"Sweet Nothing\", \"Drinking from the Bottle\", \"I Need Your Love\" and \"Thinking About You\", all of which, along with \"We Found Love\" featuring Rihanna, reached the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart, making 18 Months the first album in history to spawn nine top-10 singles.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 57, based on 17 reviews. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music hailed the album as a \"collection almost exclusively in the key of triumph\", as well as \"a portfolio of win for Calvin, an annual report where the graph is almost all peaks and the troughs are so far down they're practically invisible.\" Arwa Haider of Metro commented that \"18 Months could be a capsule collection of smash singles, yet it also works brilliantly as an album. That's partly because these are never faceless anthems; its singers [...] are well judged and rise to the songs, while the catchy hooks are lovingly arranged\". AllMusic's Tim Sendra wrote that the album \"shows Harris to be a solid producer with an easily identifiable sound.\" Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times noted that despite the variety of male collaborators, the album \"only deepens the impression that Harris is best when linked with a lady; his skills in that area are several times more developed than they are anywhere else.\" The Independent's Andy Gill was unimpressed by Ellie Goulding's performance on \"I Need Your Love\", but complimented Welch on \"Sweet Nothing\", and cited Harris's collaboration with Nicky Romero on \"Iron\" as the album's \"killer cut\".Emily Mackay of NME opined that \"[t]he best collaborations stand alone, but the rest demands small hours and sweat to animate it\", stating the album \"feels more like a deserved victory lap than a forward step or a new instalment, but apart from his sole vocal on 'Feel So Close', the victor seems oddly absent.\" Killian Fox of The Observer remarked, \"Nothing else on 18 Months matches up to the blockbusting collaborations with Kelis, Florence Welch and Rihanna\", concluding that \"Harris's production has become increasingly homogenised and, despite the array of vocalists, everything here risks sounding the same.\" At Entertainment Weekly, Melissa Maerz complimented songs like \"We Found Love\" and \"I Need Your Love\", but found that the album does not offer \"many surprises\". Despite referring to Harris as a \"brilliant pop craftsman\", The A.V. Club's Chris DeVille felt that the album \"suffers from EDM fatigue\" and that \"almost every track eventually congeals into the same automaton thud.\" Evan Sawdey of PopMatters critiqued that \"while 18 Months [...] is pretty much the hit-making monster that launched [Harris] in to the world spotlight, the truth of the matter is that it feels like a rather compromised vision of who he is an artist, sacrificing his quirkiness for a brooding new persona that starts to get stale over the course of a complete full-length.\" The Guardian critic Rebecca Nicholson expressed that \"Harris knows how to make the most of his guests, leading them through a series of euphoric bangers that seem destined for success. But for all the pop divas he has roped in, there's a veneer of cynical, laddy EDM, resulting in the kind of tracks Skrillex might come up with on an Ayia Napa booze cruise.\""

A variant spelling of the Scottish Gaelic name is Aonghus. The Irish form of the Scottish Gaelic name is Aengus. A pet form of the given name Angus is Angie, pronounced \"an-ghee\", which represents the Scottish Gaelic Angaidh. A short form of the given name Angus is Gus, which may be lengthened to Gussie. The feminine form of Angus is Angusina.The earliest form of the given name Angus, and its cognates, occurs in Adomn\u00e1n's Vita Columbae (English: \"Life of Columba\") as Oinogusius, Oinogussius. This name likely refers to a Pictish king whose name is recorded variously as Onnust, Hungus. According to historian Alex Woolf, the early Gaelic form of the name, Oengus, was borrowed from the Pictish Onuist, which appears in British as Ungust. Woolf noted that these names are all derived from the Celtic *Oinogustos. Linguist John Kneen derived this name from two Celtic elements the following way: *Oino-gustos, meaning \"one-choice\". Woolf also stated that between about AD 350 and AD 660, the Insular Celtic dialects underwent changes which included the loss of the final syllables and unstressed vowels, which affected *Oinogustos thus: *Oinogustos."

        "content": "Conceived in the autumn of 1987 by five Parisians, Jean-Michel Boissier, Herv\u00e9 Lavergne, Maurice Ronai, Jacques Rosselin and Juan Calderon, Courrier international was first published on the 8 November 1990, one year after the fall of the Berlin Wall, financed by Pierre Berg\u00e9 and Guy de Wouters (of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique). The paper is published by the media group La Vie-Le Monde (lit.\u2009'The Life \u2013 The World').A \"Volume Zero\", in a print run of several hundred demonstration copies, was printed on the 22 June 1988. It was financed by a fund-raising round from family and friends of the founders, brought together a few months earlier in a method dubbed the \"calendar multiplier\" by Ronai and Rosselin.\nThe magazine's publication was prescient, it was a time of important international news and the second issue sold 40,000. The issues published during the Gulf War, begun in January 1991, which translated Arab newspapers banned in France, were especially successful. A series of big world developments proved the viability of the concept: the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis described by Russian journalists, Algerian elections through the eyes of the Arab press, the Maastricht referendum as written about in Europe, and Bill Clinton's election as predicted by American newspapers.Jacques Rosselin, one of the founders, managed the magazine until the end of 1994, less than a year after it was bought by G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Occidentale (a subsidiary of Alcatel, which also owned L'Express and Le Point). The deal was completed in March 1994 for 83 million francs, though the magazine would wait until 1999 to break even. Courrier International  was then sold to Vivendi, together with L'Express, then to Le Monde group, which had looked to buy it since its creation.  Rosselin was succeeded by Bernard Wouts, who joined via G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Occidentale. Wouts, a former executive of le Monde, had met with the founders in 1989 but declined their offer to join the then fledgling magazine.Today the paper is part of Le Monde group and edited by Philippe Thureau-Dangin, who joined in 1993. A number of original employees are still there, the most senior are Hidenobu Suzuki and Kazuhiko Yatabe, who worked on number zero in June 1988.For its twentieth anniversary, on the 9 September 2010, Courrier international unveiled a new logo and layout. The redesign was accompanied by a marketing campaign which included an image of two planes circling, without colliding with, the digitally shortened towers of the World Trade Center in New York. The implication being that if the towers had been smaller there would have been no collision. The image, which illustrated the magazine's new slogan \u00ab Learn to anticipate \u00bb (\u00ab Apprendre \u00e0 anticiper \u00bb), solicited numerous negative reactions in the United States.In 2020 the circulation of Courier International was of 168,766 copies."

        "content": "Carpe Diem is the third studio album by Spanish singer Belinda, released on March 23, 2010, through Capitol Latin. It is primarily electropop music, a departure from the pop rock sound of her previous albums. It debuted on the Billboard Top Latin Albums at number 12, number three on the Latin Pop Albums and number 21 on the Top Heatseekers Albums. In Mexico, entered at number seven and number five in the category in Spanish.On March 25, two days after its release, Carpe Diem was certified gold; with the help of Belinda offering an autograph session in Mexico City, more than 30,000 copies were sold. The title comes from the Latin phrase that translates literally to \"Long live the day\" or \"Seize the day\", coined by the Roman poet Horace. The phrase was adopted by Belinda who was inspired by the movie Dead Poets Society. Carpe Diem contains, as described by the singer, a much happier, upbeat sound with positive lyrics as opposed to her previous album Utop\u00eda that had a darker, more personal tone to it.Among the producers are the Mexican Golden Baqueiro, who produced the theme \"Sal de mi Piel\" in Los Angeles, and Jimmy Harry, who produced the theme \"Egoista\" and worked on her previous album  Utop\u00eda. The album also features production by French artist Arno Elias, who produced the theme \"Amor Transg\u00e9nico\" as well as the participation of the Spanish Carlos Jean. Belinda composed most of the material and was involved with the image of the album along with her father, its executive producer."

        "content": "Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page is a live album by English rock group the Yardbirds.  It was recorded at the Anderson Theatre in New York City on 30 March 1968.  At the time, the Yardbirds had been performing as a quartet with Jimmy Page on lead guitar since October 1966.The album includes several familiar Yardbird songs, but often extended with longer instrumental solos.  \"I'm Confused,\" based on Jake Holmes' \"Dazed and Confused\", is a highlight of the album.  Using some different lyrics, Page re-recorded it with Led Zeppelin for their debut album later in 1968.\nThe group was dissatisfied with the recordings and objected to their release, but after Page became famous with Led Zeppelin, Epic Records issued the album in September 1971.  Page took legal action and Epic was enjoined from further distribution of the album.  Over the years, there were several more attempts to release the album.  In 2017, Page discovered the concert tapes in his personal archive and remixed the recordings.  An album with the Anderson concert and demo recordings from the same time, were released in November 2017 on Yardbirds '68."

        "content": "Although a live album, Epic Records overdubbed crowd noises from bullfights and other sound effects onto the original tracks against the band's wishes, in part because the live recordings were considered lacking in sound quality. This was a result of the general inexperience of the engineers in recording live rock music. For example, only a single microphone was deployed for the drums, hung above the kit. This resulted in the loss of much of the lower-range percussion in the recording.The Yardbirds rejected the album as a candidate for release upon its original completion in mid-1968, but Epic released it in 1971 in response to Led Zeppelin's success in the marketplace. Page took legal action against the label for releasing Live Yardbirds without authorization and Epic quickly withdrew it. Epic parent CBS' Columbia Special Products (CSP) label reissued the album in 1976, but this was again legally challenged by Page, and the album again quickly withdrawn.Authentic Epic and CSP copies of Live Yardbirds are thus quite rare, and the album has often been counterfeited (sometimes in black-and-white covers claimed to be promotional copies) as a result.  The album's cover art was designed by James Grashow, a woodcut artist who had earlier created the artwork for Jethro Tull's 1969 album Stand Up."

It was performed in Italian by Gigliola Cinquetti representing Italy. Like all previous Italian Eurovision entries, the song had also won that year's Sanremo Music Festival. Cinquetti was sixteen years old, making her the youngest Eurovision winner in history until 1986 when Belgium's Sandra Kim won the contest with \"J'aime la vie\" \u2013 initially claiming to be fifteen, it was later revealed that Kim was only thirteen. In 1990, the EBU made a new rule requiring contestants to be aged 16 or older before the contest; this age rule still operates.\nThe song was performed twelfth on the night, following Portugal's Ant\u00f3nio Calv\u00e1rio with \"Ora\u00e7\u00e3o\" and preceding Yugoslavia's Sabahudin Kurt with \"\u017divot je sklopio krug\". By the close of voting, it had received 49 points, placing it first in a field of 16.\n\"Non ho l'et\u00e0\" became a considerable commercial success for Cinquetti, in Italy, the rest of Europe, Scandinavia and other countries worldwide; she also recorded the song in English (\"This is my prayer\"), Spanish (\"No tengo edad\"), French (\"Je suis \u00e0 toi\"), German (\"Luna nel blu\"), and Japanese (\"Yumemiru omoi\", \u5922\u307f\u308b\u60f3\u3044). The song has since been recorded by a wide range of artists in other languages, for example, in Icelandic as \"Heyr m\u00edna b\u00e6n\" by Ell\u00fd Vilhj\u00e1lms. Lili Ivanova, a famous Bulgarian singer, and Hong Kong singer Rebecca Pan, covered the song in 1964. Polish-Belarusian singer Wies\u0142awa Drojecka covered the song in Polish (\"Nie wolno mi\"). Anneli Sari made a Finnish cover (\"Liian nuori rakkauteen\"). Sandra Reemer recorded the song in Dutch (\"Als jij maar wacht\").\nThe song was followed as contest winner in 1965 by France Gall singing \"Poup\u00e9e de cire, poup\u00e9e de son\" for Luxembourg. It was followed as Italian representative that year by Bobby Solo with \"Se piangi, se ridi\".\nCinquetti later returned to perform at the contest in 1974, when she finished second with \"S\u00ec\", behind ABBA's \"Waterloo\". In 1991, she co-hosted the contest in Rome alongside Toto Cutugno. In 2022, she performed the song as an interval act at the Eurovision final in Turin.\nCinquetti was proved not to be a UK 'one-hit-wonder' when an English recording of her 1974 Eurovision entry (titled \"Go\") reached #8 in the UK chart."

Its screenplay, written by Klimov and Ales Adamovich, is based on the 1971 novel Khatyn and the 1977 memoir I Am from the Fiery Village (\u042f \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438, Ya iz ognennoy derevni), of which Adamovich was a co-author. Klimov had to fight eight years of censorship from the Soviet authorities before he could be allowed to produce the film in its entirety.The film's plot focuses on the Nazi German occupation of Belarus, and the events as witnessed by a young teenager named Flyora, who joins the Belarusian partisans, and thereafter depicts the Nazi atrocities and human suffering inflicted upon the Eastern European region's populace. The film mixes hyper-realism with an underlying surrealism, and philosophical existentialism with poetical, psychological, political and apocalyptic themes.\nCome and See received generally positive critical reception upon release, and received the FIPRESCI prize at the 14th Moscow International Film Festival. It has since come to be considered one of the greatest films of all time; in the 2022 Sight & Sound directors' poll of the Greatest Films of all Time, it ranked 41st."

        "content": "In 1943, Flyora and another Belarusian boy dig up an abandoned SVT-40 rifle from a sand-filled trench to join the Soviet partisan forces. They do so in defiance of their village elder, who warns them that this would arouse the suspicions of the occupying Germans. The boys' activities are noticed by an Fw 189 reconnaissance aircraft, flying overhead.\nThe next day, partisans arrive at Flyora's house to conscript him, against his mother's wishes. Flyora becomes a low-rank militiaman who performs menial tasks. When the partisans move on, their commander Kosach orders Flyora to remain behind at the camp. Bitterly disappointed, Flyora walks into the forest weeping and meets Glasha, a young adolescent girl working as a nurse for the partisans, and the two bond before the camp is attacked by German paratroopers and dive bombers.\nFlyora is partially deafened from the explosions before the two hide in the forest. Flyora and Glasha travel to his village, only to find his home deserted and covered in flies. Denying that his family is dead, Flyora believes they are hiding on a nearby island across a bog. Following an arrogantly running Flyora from his village, Glasha by chance turns her head and sees a pile of executed villagers' bodies at a house wall, but refrains from alerting Flyora. The two become hysterical after wading through the bog, where Glasha screams at Flyora that his family is actually dead in the village, resulting in him pushing her into the water, then immediately trying to rescue her. Rubezh, a partisan fighter, comes across them and takes them to meet the surviving villagers, including the badly burnt village elder, who tells Flyora of his family's deaths and that he should not have dug up the rifles. Flyora attempts suicide out of guilt by submerging his head in the bog, but Glasha and the villagers save and comfort him.\nRubezh takes Flyora and two other men to find food at a nearby warehouse, only to find it being guarded by German troops. During their retreat, the two companions are killed by a land mine. Rubezh and Flyora steal a cow from a collaborating farmer, but a German machine gun fires upon them, killing Rubezh and the cow. Flyora later attempts to steal a horse and cart, but the owner catches him and instead of doing him harm, he helps hide Flyora's identity when SS troops approach.\nFlyora is taken to the village of Perekhody, where they hurriedly discuss a fake identity for him, while an SS Einsatzkommando, accompanied by collaborators from the Russian Liberation Army and Schutzmannschaft Battalion 118, surround and occupy the village. Flyora tries to warn the townsfolk as they are being herded to their deaths, but is forced to join them inside a barn church. Flyora and a young woman are allowed to escape the church, but the latter is dragged by her hair into a truck to be gang raped. The German forces shoot, burn and throw explosives into the church. A German officer points a gun to Flyora's head to pose for a picture, then abandons him as the soldiers leave.\n\nFlyora later wanders away from the scorched village, discovering that the partisans ambushed the Germans. Flyora recovers his jacket and rifle and is joined by the girl who was dragged off by SS soldiers, bleeding and in a fugue state after being gang-raped. Flyora returns to the village, where the partisans have captured eleven of the Germans and their collaborators, including the commander, an SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer. The commander and main collaborator plead for their lives and deflect blame, but a young fanatical officer, an Obersturmf\u00fchrer, is unapologetic and vows they will carry out their genocidal mission. Kosach makes the collaborator douse the Germans with petrol, but the disgusted crowd shoots them all before they can be set on fire. \nAs the partisans leave, Flyora notices a framed portrait of Adolf Hitler in a puddle and proceeds to shoot it numerous times. As he does so, a montage of clips from Hitler's life plays in reverse, but when Hitler is shown as a baby on his mother Klara's lap, Flyora stops shooting and cries. A title card informs \"628 Belorussian villages were destroyed, along with all their inhabitants\". Flyora rushes to rejoin his comrades."

        "content": "Klimov co-wrote the screenplay with Ales Adamovich, who fought with the Belarusian partisans as a teenager. According to the director's recollections, work on the film began in 1977:\n\nThe 40th anniversary of the Great Victory was approaching. The management had to be given something topical. I had been reading and rereading the book I Am from the Fiery Village, which consisted of the first-hand accounts of people who miraculously survived the horrors of the fascist genocide in Belorussia. Many of them were still alive then, and Belorussians managed to record some of their memories onto film. I will never forget the face and eyes of one peasant, and his quiet recollection about how his whole village had been herded into a church, and how just before they were about to be burned, an officer gave them the offer: \"Whoever has no children can leave\". And he couldn't take it, he left, and left behind his wife and little kids ... or about how another village was burned: the adults were all herded into a barn, but the children were left behind. And later, the drunk men surrounded them with sheepdogs and let the dogs tear the children to pieces.\nAnd then I thought: the world doesn't know about Khatyn! They know about Katyn, about the massacre of the Polish officers there. But they don't know about Belorussia. Even though more than 600 villages were burned there!\nAnd I decided to make a film about this tragedy. I perfectly understood that the film would end up a harsh one. I decided that the central role of the village lad Flyora would not be played by a professional actor, who upon immersion into a difficult role could have protected himself psychologically with his accumulated acting experience, technique and skill. I wanted to find a simple boy fourteen years of age. We had to prepare him for the most difficult experiences, then capture them on film. And at the same time, we had to protect him from the stresses so that he wasn't left in the loony bin after filming was over, but was returned to his mother alive and healthy. Fortunately, with Aleksei Kravchenko, who played Flyora and who later became a good actor, everything went smoothly.\nThe events with the people, the peasants, actually happened as shown in the film. [It] doesn't have any professional actors. Even the language spoken in the film is Belarusian. What was important was that all the events depicted in the film really did happen in Belarus.\n\nI understood that this would be a very brutal film and that it was unlikely that people would be able to watch it. I told this to my screenplay co-author, the writer Ales Adamovich. But he replied: \"Let them not watch it, then. This is something we must leave after us. As evidence of war, and as a plea for peace.\"\nFor eight years, filming could not begin because the State Committee for Cinematography (Goskino) would not accept the screenplay, considering it too realistic, calling it propaganda for the \"aesthetics of dirtiness\" and \"naturalism\". Alongside this, the death of Klimov's wife Larisa Shepitko, also a filmmaker, in 1979 forced him to first complete the work she began on what was to be her next film, Farewell; it would finally be released in 1983. Eventually in 1984, Klimov was able to start filming without having compromised to any censorship at all. The only change became the name of the film itself, to Come and See from the original, Kill Hitler (Klimov also says this in the 2006 UK DVD release).The film was shot in chronological order over a period of nine months. Kravchenko said that he underwent \"the most debilitating fatigue and hunger. I kept a most severe diet, and after the filming was over I returned to school not only thin, but grey-haired.\" Contrary to what some rumors suggest, though, Kravchenko's hair did not turn permanently grey. In fact, a special Silber Interference Grease-Paint, alongside a thin layer of actual silver, was used to dye his hair. This made it difficult to get it back to normal, so Kravchenko had to live with his hair like this for some time after shooting the film.To prepare the 14-year-old Kravchenko for the role, Klimov called a hypnotist with autogenic training. \"[Kravchenko's acting] could have had a very sad ending. He could have landed in an insane asylum,\" Klimov said. \"I realized I had to inject him with content which he did not possess,\" \"This is an age when a boy does not know what true hatred is, what true love is.\" \"In the end, Mr. Kravchenko was able to concentrate so intensely that it seemed as if he had hypnotized himself for the role.\"To create the maximum sense of immediacy, realism, hyperrealism, and surrealism operating in equal measure, Klimov and his cameraman Aleksei Rodionov employed naturalistic colors, widescreen and lots of Steadicam shots; the film is full of extreme close-ups of faces, does not flinch from the unpleasant details of burnt flesh and bloodied corpses, and the guns were often loaded with live ammunition as opposed to blanks. Kravchenko mentioned in interviews that bullets sometimes passed just 4 inches (10 centimeters) above his head (such as in the cow scene). Very little protection was provided on the set. When the dive bombs were detonated the camera crew only had a concrete slab 1.5 meters tall and 5 meters wide to protect them. At the same time the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne is fragmentary and disjointed: there are discontinuities between shots as characters appear in close up and then disappear off camera. Elsewhere, the moment of revelation is marked by a disorienting zoom-in/dolly-out shot."

The tale's characters come to life, come to his house and set out to live their lives. \nMany years ago, the Wizard came up with a \"reverse\" fairy tale, turning a bear into a human (Aleksandr Abdulov), who would transform back into a bear as soon as a princess falls in love with him and kisses him. Now, the young man returns to the Wizard's house where he meets a beautiful girl (Yevgeniya Simonova), and they immediately fall in love with each other. To his dismay, she turns out to be a princess \u2013 the Wizard made it so that a king (Yevgeny Leonov) who was just passing by with his daughter and his suite felt a sudden urge to stop by the estate. When the Princess, clueless about the young man's origin, wants to kiss him, he flees in horror.\nThe Princess hurries after him, dressed as a boy. They meet in a tavern called \"Emilia\", but the Bear, unable to recognize the Princess, summons her to a duel. However, when the Princess cries out \"Daddy\" during the battle, the Bear realizes that she deceived him.\nIn anger, he goes to the innkeeper (Yury Solomin) and begs to be to locked up, as the tavern is covered with snow and it is impossible to get out. The innkeeper gives him the key to a room. He draws his attention to one of the court ladies and recognizes in her his first love Emilia, in whose honor he named the inn. The innkeeper and Emilia decide to help the quarreled lovers.\nThe Princess locks herself in a room on the second floor of the inn and promises to shoot anyone who would come to her. The King orders to draw lots and the lot comes out for the court Minister Administrator (Andrei Mironov). The Administrator comes to the Princess, and a shot rings out \u2013 leaving behind the Princess, the administrator shoots her, but misses. The Princess angrily decides to marry the first courter and announces the Administrator to be her fianc\u00e9.\nThe King decides to play a wedding. Desperate, his love taken away from him, the Bear decides to tell all about the princess kiss that would turn him into a beast, but the Princess rejects him.\nThe wedding procession leaves. The Hunter (Vsevolod Larionov) and the Bear remain in the tavern. The Wizard appears and tells the Bear that he was disappointed in his behavior. He calls the Bear a coward. In the opinion of the Wizard the Bear should have kissed the princess. The fact that he didn't do that shows that he does not love the princess so much as to sacrifice his human form. The Bear and the Hunter make an agreement under which, if ever the Bear is to kiss the Princess and to turn into an animal, the Hunter will kill him.\nExactly one year passes by. The country is actually ruled by the Administrator instead of the King. The Princess is slowly dying of longing for the Bear. The Wizard intentionally does not let the Bear in the country and into his house, because he thinks that the tale with a sad end has much more to teach people, and stories with a happy ending are just for children.\nAs the Princess feels death coming, the Bear appears in the house of the Wizard. The Hunter is aiming the gun at the Bear. The Bear kisses the princess, but does not turn into a bear, and stays a man. The Wizard explains this paradox to be an ordinary miracle.\nThe characters leave the Wizard's house that turns out to be all scenery. The decorations burn and the Wizard is left alone."

Basically, you\u2019ll either love it or you\u2019ll hate it, but no doubt it\u2019ll be another success in the fans\u2019 eyes.\"Musical Ramble rated the record 3.5/5, saying \"I came into IV feeling skeptical that the seemingly schizophrenic personality of the band would eventually be their downfall, but came out pleasantly optimistic about what the album might be like.  The EP isn\u2019t without its flaws and I still think the inclusion of 'The City' was a bad call considering it will be the last release before the album.\""

Tracy lives with her mother and brother Ray in the suburb of Cabramatta, Sydney, where heroin is readily available.\nShe is in need of money to become a partner in the video store that she works in, but her loan applications are repeatedly rejected by finance providers, as a result of her past criminal record, poor repayments of credit card debt, history of drug use and lack of collateral. Tracy lies to both her mother and her boss at the video store, pretending she has received the loan. The casual ways people lie to each other for convenience is one of the recurring themes of the movie.\nTracy is trying to help her drug addicted stepfather and former National Rugby League star Lionel Dawson to kick his heroin addiction.\nAfter a four-year absence in Vancouver, her former boyfriend Jonny Nguyen, also a former heroin addict, has come back into her life. Jonny, who now dresses in business suits, claims to have employment as a stockbroker at a large firm and suggests he may be able to obtain the money Tracy desires through share trading. The romance between Tracy and Jonny is rekindled.\nUpon visiting Jonny's alleged workplace, Tracy discovers Jonny has lied to her and is not in fact employed as a stockbroker. Jonny has become involved in a drug deal with her brother Ray, and Tracy also chooses to become involved in the deal as she sees this as the only means of providing the finance she needs to become a partner in the video store.\nTracy, Ray, and Jonny set out to execute the deal, which ends in tragedy. Tracy's courage and deep love for those she cares about are notable in the climactic scenes of the film."

        "content": "Holly is an English-language surname and given name. \nHolly is known as an English or Irish surname (variant Holley) it is either locational, ultimately derived from the Old English hol l\u0113ah \"[dwelling by] the clearing by the hollow\", or descriptive, from hol-\u0113age \"hollow-eyed\". In Ireland, it was also used as a translation of the name Mac Cuilinn, which is derived from cuileann, the Gaelic name of the holly tree, and by extension sometimes of the similar-sounding  McQuillan surname of Ulster. The masculine names Holly, Hollie were derived from the surname, but have mostly fallen out of use since the mid 20th century due to the rise in popularity of the feminine name.  Hollis is an English surname derived from a Middle English holis \"[dwelling by] holly trees\"; it was also used as a masculine given name.\nHolly (variants Hollie, Holley) was first used as a feminine given name in the 20th century, as a \"botanical\" name given to girls, in reference to, or at least secondarily associated with, the holly tree. While the feminine name is on record in the United States since the 1930s, its surge in popularity was due to Holly Golightly, the socialite protagonist in Truman Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's (1958), which was made into a film starring Audrey Hepburn in 1961. The name of this character is stated to be short for Holiday (rather than a reference to the plant).\nThe name peaked in popularity in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, and has declined since, ranking at #380 in the United States as of 2009. It was popularly given in England and Wales during the 2000s, staying in the top 30 girls' names throughout 1996\u20132012, with a peak at rank #12 in 2002 (and dropping to rank #33 as of 2013). A tendency to give the name to girls born on or near Christmas has also been observed.  It has been the most popular name given to girls in Ireland who were born on Christmas Day and has also been more popular for girls there born in December than at other times of the year. More recent eccentric spellings of the feminine name include Holli (1970s), Holleigh, Hollee, and Hollye."

They next encounter a talking crow, who is described in the intertitles thus: \"For the benefit of those who were not paying attention or are in doubt, we remind you that the Crow is \u2013 as you say \u2013 a left-wing intellectual of the kind found living before Palmiro Togliatti's death\").\nThe Crow subsequently recounts the tale of \"Fra Ciccillo\" and \"Fra Ninetto\" (still played by Tot\u00f2 and Ninetto), two Franciscan friars, who are bid by St. Francis to preach the Gospel to the hawks (representing the powerful) and the sparrows (representing the weak). After many failures they discover the language of birds and succeed in preaching the commandment of love unto the species separately, but are not able to get them to love each other. The hawks continue to kill and eat the sparrows, as it is in their nature. Saint Francis explains the relationship between the two groups to them from a Marxist perspective and invites them to continue proselytizing.\nAfter the tale, the journey of Tot\u00f2 and Ninetto carries on, the Crow still accompanying them. They encounter other individuals: land-owners who order them off their land when they are caught defecating; a family living in absolute poverty with no food and whom Tot\u00f2 threatens to drive out of the house if the rent is not paid; a group of travelling actors (representing figures marginalised from society such as women, gays, the elderly, racial minorities, and the disabled) and who persuade the pair to push the group's Cadillac car for them; and a rich man who is waiting for Tot\u00f2 to give him the money he owes him (in contrast to the earlier episode where Toto had demanded rent). This is followed by news footage of the funeral of Palmiro Togliatti, the long-time leader of the Italian Communist Party. Finally, after having met a prostitute, the two end up killing and eating the Crow, whom they found to be unconscionably boring.\nPasolini declared that Uccellacci e uccellini was his favourite film, as it was the only one that did not disappoint his expectations.\nEnnio Morricone's opening theme music features Domenico Modugno singing the movie's credits."

        "content": "At the start of 1969, guitarist and vocalist Gary Duncan temporarily left the band, upon which they ceased touring. The remaining members played a small handful of gigs in the spring and summer of the year with guest vocalist Nick Gravenites before hiring ace session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins to permanently join them that August, although only three gigs were played with this lineup until regular touring began again on New Year's Eve with the return of Duncan and the addition of Dino Valenti. Nonetheless, the band began recording their third album with Hopkins that summer. \nThe influence of Nicky Hopkins, the English journeyman pianist who appears on albums by Jeff Beck, The Rolling Stones, The Who, all four of The Beatles and Steve Miller is felt throughout Shady Grove, and his contributions pushed the group in new directions. However, David Freiberg's vocal presence and John Cipollina's idiosyncratic guitar stylings make the Quicksilver sound of the first two albums still apparent.\nHopkins re-recorded the closing track, \"Edward, The Mad Shirt Grinder\", on his solo album The Tin Man Was a Dreamer, which features members of the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. (\u201cEdward\u201d was a nickname for Nicky Hopkins, made up by Brian Jones during a 1967 session at Olympic Studios in London. The story goes that Jones was tuning his guitar and asked Hopkins to give him an E on the piano; with other noise interfering and Nicky unable to hear what he was saying, Brian eventually shouted out: \"Give me an E, like in Edward!\") The track's elaborate, classically inspired keyboard work and extended jamming veers closer to an English progressive rock sound. \"Flute Song\", with its melancholic piano and string backing (ironically, no flute appears), is also prog-influenced. \"Joseph's Coat\", co-written by John Cipollina and Nick Gravenites, also appears on Big Brother and the Holding Company's album Be a Brother, which featured Gravenites on vocals.\nThe cover was designed by George Hunter's Global Propaganda  and featured a slightly edited version of a work by painter L.K. Hollister, of otherwise unknown personal information.The album became the group's highest-charting when it hit #25 on Billboard that winter."

According to the booklet the lyrics were written by Frankestein (which is an alias for Gianni Sassi), and the music was written by Demetrio Stratos, Giulio Capiozzo and Patrick Djivas except \"Consapevolezza\" (co-writing with Patrizio Fariselli). All tracks were registered on Italian SIAE to Terzo Fariselli (Patrizio's father), due to the fact that the musicians were not members of SIAE.\n\"Luglio, Agosto, Settembre (nero)\" became Area's first hit. Most of the 7\" censored the word \"nero\", which was a reference to Black September). It was released as a juke box item only, and the b-side was the song \"Mi\u00f1a\" by Italian prog band Aktuala. On the posthumous live release \"Concerto Teatro Uomo\", Demetrio Stratos says that \"L'abbattimento dello Zeppelin\" was composed after a pub at which they were playing asked them to perform \"Whole Lotta Love\". They didn't know the song and played that one instead, and they got fired. Guitarist Paolo Tofani can be heard quoting the main riff during his solo. \"L'abbattimento dello Zeppelin\" was also released as a 7\", backed by the title track of the album, but failed to enter the charts."

Drummer Stewart Copeland said about the time pressures: \"We had bitten off more than we could chew. ... we finished the album at 4 a.m. on the day we were starting our next world tour. We went to bed for a few hours and then traveled down to Belgium for the first gig. It was cutting it very fine.\"The band had wanted to record the album at Surrey Sound, the recording site of their first two albums, but could not record at any British studio for tax reasons. They were, however, able to retain Nigel Gray as their co-producer, bringing him with them to Wisseloord Studios in the Netherlands. Feeling that he had played a significant part in the Police's first two albums, Gray negotiated for a \u00a325,000 (\u00a390,000 in 2019) fee , which brought the album's total budget to \u00a335,000 (more than twice the combined budgets of their first two albums, but still exceptionally cheap for a band who at that point had become established stars).As mentioned by Copeland, the Police embarked on a tour of the world the day of the album's completion, beginning in Belgium and finishing in Australia."

As bassist and vocalist Sting refused to play on it, Summers recorded the bass line himself, overdubbing the guitar parts. According to Sting, \"I hated that song so much that, one day when I was in the studio, I found the tape lying on the table. So I took it around the back of the studio and actually buried it in the garden.\" Nigel Gray believed that the title was an in-joke by Summers: \"He didn't tell me this himself but I'm 98% sure the reason is this: what would you find behind a camel? A monumental pile of shit.\"\"Bombs Away\" was written and demoed using a Siouxsie and the Banshees tape. Copeland said that \"when he first set up his home studio he got hold of a load of second hand tape which included some stuff by Siouxsie and the Banshees. 'Bombs Away' was written on a Siouxsie and the Banshees backing track. I changed the speed and did things to the EQ to change the drum pattern. So with the desk I can get my song playing, then press a switch and there's Siouxsie singing away.\"Zenyatta Mondatta also saw the band's lyrics turning towards political events, with Sting's \"Driven to Tears\" commenting on poverty and Copeland's \"Bombs Away\" referring to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

It doesn't have a specific meaning like \"Police Brutality\" or \"Police Arrest\", or anything predictable like that. Being vague it says a lot more. You can interpret it in a lot of different ways. It's not an attempt to be mysterious, just syllables that sound good together, like the sound of a melody that has no words at all has a meaning. Miles (Stewart Copeland's brother and group manager) came up with \"Trimondo Blondomina\". Very subtle. Geddit? Like three blondes and the world. Then somebody thought of \"Caprido Von Renislam\". That rolls off the tongue. It was the address of the studio.\nJerry Moss, co-founder of A&M Records, named the champion racehorse Zenyatta (born 2004) after the album. Blizzard Entertainment also named a character Zenyatta (and his brother, non-playable character \u2013 Mondatta) in the video game Overwatch. Additionally, in the English translation of the manga Stardust Crusaders published by VIZ Media, the characters Oingo and Boingo are renamed Zenyatta and Mondatta due to copyright laws."

In the United States, it spent almost three years on the Billboard 200 chart and peaked at number five. The album produced two singles, \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" and \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\". On the UK Singles Chart, the former became the band's third number one, while the latter reached number five. The two singles also became the band's first top ten hits on the US Billboard Hot 100, with both peaking at number ten on the chart.A&M Records first remastered the album for release in compact disc format in the US in 1990. Frank DeLuna and Marv Bornstein mastered the original 1980 vinyl LP, but it is unclear if they also remastered the CD.Sting would later perform his own version of \"Shadows in the Rain\" on his 1985 debut solo album The Dream of the Blue Turtles. In 1986, the Police re-recorded \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" and \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\". The former was released on Every Breath You Take: The Singles, while the latter was released on the DTS version of Every Breath You Take: The Classics. \"When the World Is Running Down, You Make the Best of What's Still Around\" was remixed by the production duo Different Gear and released as a single in 2000, credited to \"Different Gear vs. The Police\". It reached number 28 on the UK Singles Chart."

        "content": "In a 1980 review for Rolling Stone, David Fricke praised Zenyatta Mondatta as \"near-perfect pop by a band that bends all the rules and sometimes makes musical mountains out of molehill-size ideas\", complimenting the band's \"elastic\" interplay. Phil Sutcliffe of Sounds wrote that he initially viewed the album as inferior to the band's earlier material, but came to recognise its strength, despite still finding it somewhat unadventurous: \"By word and note it's as articulate and literate as you might hope. It avoids a whole catalogue of megastar pitfalls. Zenyatta is not pretentious, not bombastic, not lazy.\" In Smash Hits, David Hepworth opined that Sting had particularly improved as a vocalist and songwriter, describing his compositions as \"tougher, more concerned, but no less melodic.\"Zenyatta Mondatta was voted the 28th best album of 1980 in The Village Voice's year-end Pazz & Jop critics' poll. At the Grammy Awards in 1982, \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" won for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, while \"Behind My Camel\" won for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, marking the Police's second consecutive win in the latter category.Retrospectively, AllMusic critic Greg Prato cited Zenyatta Mondatta as \"arguably the best Police album\" and \"one of the finest rock albums of all time.\" In 2004's The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, J. D. Considine highlighted the more pronounced groove of the music: \"The emphasis on rhythmic intensity made the songs catchier (as 'Voices Inside My Head' shows, the band certainly knew how to work a vamp), and the rhythmic dynamics add a singular punch to the material.\"The singer Bilal names it among his 25 favourite albums, citing its fusion of rock, reggae, and dub music."

After Spain \u2013 the second-placed country of 1979 \u2013 and (reportedly) the United Kingdom both declined to host, the Netherlands ultimately agreed to host the show in a small-scale production. According to the first minister Yair Lapid, son of Tommy Lapid who was then the IBA director general, his father called his then counterpart at NOS and convinced him to take the \"undesired honour\", when he realised that the extra cost could paralyse the regular work of the IBA.The contest took place in The Hague at the Congresgebouw (presently known as the World Forum).

My first album was so personal that I didn't know how to bounce back and talk about something else. The first album, I had written six years, while there were only two years that passed. And what had I lived apart from a tour, a controversy and having banged three groupies? I do caricature, but there was nothing to tell an interesting story. I wrote Le chant des sir\u00e8nes by mixing reality and fiction, a little to rid myself of all that. In the end it helped me.\nThe album is called Le chant des sir\u00e8nes (French for \"the siren's song\"), because it is \"at an age and in an era where there are many temptations, many addicitions, a lot more than in the time of our grandparents. All my songs talk about it,\" explains Orelsan. In a similar fashion he explains the title of his album:\n\nIt's easy, on Facebook and Twitter, when you're a bit known, when you're not doing well, you say it, and people you don't even know come in to bring your morale back up. It's also because of this that I called my album Le chant des sir\u00e8nes, compared to this thing of temptation that creates social networks."

I worked hard. I never went out. (...) I didn't see my friends for some time. I isolated myself at the countryside for a week. Writing, for me, is neither simple nor natural. I have to force it. It doesn't come by itself. The first stage is to find out what I'm going to talk about. Once I find the subject matter, I have to determine what I'm going to say and finally look for the rhymes. I can't do it as a hobby. On my first album, I wrote certain songs quickly like \"Soir\u00e9e rat\u00e9e\", but it's rare. On this album, I was more demanding, more ambitious.\nIn an interview with Les Inrocks, Orelsan says that he didn't know what to talk about anymore. He explains, \"In my first album, I talked about the previous ten years of my life, and at the time I almost never lived at all: I did a tour, sparked a controversy and banged three groupies (laughs).\" On his first album, Perdu d'avance, Orelsan wrote fourteen songs without touching up anything, and threw about thirty songs away before finding \"this mix of rapping and singing, this mix of myself and someone I'm not.\" He also says that he introduced more fiction, something that he wouldn't do before. He continues, \"I confined myself at home, I went on vacations alone. I was at times very depressed.\" In another interview, Orelsan explains that the album's title song \"Le chant des sir\u00e8nes\" was \"a breaking point\".\n\nI already created the beginning of the album. \"Le chant des sir\u00e8nes\" helped me to get to the end because it talks about reality mixed with fiction. I told myself: \"It's not bad to release a bit of myself and add a bit of fiction.\" Before I could spend 10 hours in front of a blank sheet wondering, \"What am I going to do?\" Now, I don't hesitate to read a book, to watch a film without feeling like stealing something from someone. I just take impression. I don't hesitate to call a friend, to ask him what he's doing. And in my head, I do a sort of interview to look for inspiration. Before, I had a sort of ego. I had to invent everything.\nAccording to the rapper, the song \"La petite marchande de porte-clefs\" is one that \"dragged on for a long time\". In finding a subject matter for the song, he explains that he came across a report on the post-Olympic Games in Beijing and what happened to people who were exploited there, and also saw something on the kidnappings of children in China. He says that he imagined \"the destiny of a girl my age who would've lived all that.\"\n\nIt started with an instrumental that I made. I make them but they rarely land on my albums. I sampled some Chinese thing. I didn't know what to say about it too much. [...] I did some research. Well, I wasn't going to the library. I read articles on the one-child policy in China, the Chinese in Paris. I tried to make credible fiction of it, without it being inflated and too factual. I made something sad and a bit wicked out of it on these people who we come across in the subway at times without knowing where they're coming from.\nFor the track \"1990\", which was initially called \"Dans les ann\u00e9es 1990\" (\"In the 1990s\"), Orelsan wanted to \"try and write a track today with references of the time.\" He says that \"in these recent times, there's a tendency of returning to the rap of those years.\"Orelsan describes the song \"Suicide social\", which was released as the album's fourth single on September 15, 2011 before the album's release, as \"really a series of clich\u00e9s\", adding that he would have been able to make the song last 4 minutes more. In an interview, he says that talking about people \"as groups, as social classes, as layers, is bullshit,\" and that the song is to be taken as an example of what not to do.\n\nThere's going to be reactions. But I wasn't arguing, I wasn't reacting. I'd like people to discuss [the song] amongst themselves. It's just a song. When I started writing it, it made me think of Spike Lee's movie 25th Hour. In one scene Edward Norton has a go at all of New York' social classes, except he's more violent than me. And in the end, he tells himself: \"If I get angry with them, it's because I'm angry with myself.\" My persona, him, commits suicide at the end of the song. Nobody's ever offended by the scene from Spike Lee's movie. Why do they have to be offended by mine? Not only that, it's fiction, but not even a point of view."

It was edited by Marathi writer Shankar Dattatraya Javdekar from 1950 to 1952. Yadunath Thatte became Sadhana's editor in 1956 and continued to lead it until 1982. G.P. Pradhan was the next editor of the weekly.\nIn the early 1970s the magazine provided a forum for voices from the Dalit Panther movement, who were revolting against the treatment of low castes in Indian society. Some of the Dalit writings published by the magazine were considered to be inflammatory by the middle class and even led to calls to ban the concerned issues. Sadhana brought the Dalit activists to the attention to the Marathi intelligentsia, and gave an impetus to the growing dalit movement.The magazine served as a voice for Socialist thought in India and played a key role in the mass awakening during the 21-month-long Emergency Rule in India that was imposed in June 1975. In July 1976, the Government of India led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi intimidated the weekly to stop publication by abusive use of national defence laws. The magazine soon reopened, after winning a landmark court case concerning press freedom in which Justice V.D. Tulzapurkar of the Bombay High Court along with Justice B.C. Gadgil quashed the government order seizing the assets of Sadhana Press, and struck down censorship orders as arbitrary."

Souren went to Bamako and met people at a community center. He paid each person willing to write an article $1 U.S. The authors had no internet connections and no Wikipedia usernames. They wrote articles in Microsoft Word and gave the files to Souren. Souren uploaded each article and credited the authors. Souren wrote \"I can\u2019t understand 100 percent of what they wrote, but I could estimate that it was right. It is a Wikipedia anyway, so I hope they can correct it.\"The total expenses of the project amounted to fewer than $100 U.S. In regards to the payment, Ndesanjo Macha, a Wikipedian who speaks Swahili, argued that it is unnecessary to pay editors for their efforts, and he believed he was speaking for everyone in Africa. Noam Cohen of The New York Times wrote \"Most of the people who have heard about Mr. Souren's decision to pay for entries lauded his goal but questioned his tactics, saying that they undercut the Wikipedia spirit, and that, ultimately, a Bambara Wikipedia would work only if there was a voluntary community to support it.\" This project resulted in the partial translation of the interfaces of the Bambara and Fula Wikipedias and the creation of some articles for those Wikipedias.

The band, initially called Roundabout, was the idea of former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis, who recruited Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore before leaving the project. The Mk. I line-up of the band was completed by vocalist/frontman Rod Evans, along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Ian Paice, in March 1968.\nAfter about two months of rehearsals, Shades of Deep Purple was recorded in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers, thoroughly rearranged to include classical interludes and sound more psychedelic. Stylistically, the music is close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever-growing audience in the late 1960s.\nThe album was not well received in the UK, where it sold very few copies and did not chart. In the US, on the other hand, it was a success and the single \"Hush\", an energetic rock track written by Joe South and originally recorded by Billy Joe Royal, became very popular at the time, reaching number 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The good sales of the album and the intense radio play of the single contributed largely to the attention Deep Purple would get in their early US tours and also during the 1970s. Modern reviews of the album are generally positive and consider Shades of Deep Purple an important piece in the history of Deep Purple."

        "content": "When Deep Purple's first line-up came together in 1967, there was a moment of transition for the British music scene. Beat was still popular, especially in dance halls and outside the capital, but the tastes of young people buying records and filling up the clubs was rapidly changing in favour of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock. New bands like The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, and The Nice were pioneers in combining classical music with rock, using complex and daring arrangements. At the same time, psychedelia was making strides in the hedonistic swinging London society, where bands like Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic and Cream experimented with different forms of drug-induced rock music, in line with the hippie subculture coming from the USA. Many well-known acts, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who, were influenced by the changing feel and added many elements of progressive and psychedelic rock to their albums of that period.\nDuring this time of great creativity for the British musical scene in the summer of 1967, Chris Curtis, former drummer of the beat band The Searchers, contacted London businessman Tony Edwards to find financing for a new group he was putting together, to be called Roundabout. The name meant that the group would contain a revolving cast of non-permanent members getting on and off the stage like a musical roundabout, with only Curtis as mainstay and singer. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance and manage the venture with two business partners, Ron Hire and John Coletta, and the three of them founded Hire-Edwards-Coletta (HEC) Enterprises.\n\nIn September 1967, the first successful Roundabout recruitment was Curtis' flatmate, the classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord; he had most notably played with The Artwoods, a band led by Art Wood, brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and featuring Keef Hartley. At that time, Lord was playing in a band backing the successful pop vocalists The Flower Pot Men called The Garden, which also included bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little. Simper and Little were alerted by Lord of the Roundabout project and remained in standby for an eventual involvement. They recommended to Lord the guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whose playing Chris Curtis had appreciated when his band The Searchers had played at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany. Blackmore had been a member of The Outlaws and had played as session and live musician with many beat, pop and rock acts, including Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages, where he had met Little. Curtis contacted Blackmore to audition for the new group and persuaded him to move from Hamburg, where he was hanging out in local clubs. The guitarist came back to England for good to join the group in December 1967. Meanwhile, Curtis' erratic behaviour and his sudden loss of interest in the project he had started slowed down any development, forcing his financiers, HEC Enterprises, to drop him and entrust Lord and Blackmore with the task of filling out the rest of the band.Lord signed up as bassist his friend Simper, whose fame at the time came from his membership in the rock and roll group Johnny Kidd & The Pirates and for having survived the car crash in 1966 that killed Kidd. The line-up of Roundabout was completed by drummer Bobby Woodman, recruited by Blackmore. Dave Curtiss, an acquaintance of Woodman, was at first considered as singer, but he left to fulfill previous commitments. According to Simper, Ian Gillan, the singer of the band Episode Six, was also contacted for an audition, but declined the offer."

        "content": "Roundabout moved into Deeves Hall, a rented old farmhouse near the village of South Mimms, Hertfordshire in late February 1968. There, while waiting for the arrival of new musical instruments and equipment, they continued the search for a singer through an advertisement in the British music paper Melody Maker. Rod Stewart was among the dozens of aspiring vocalists that were considered for the auditions, but was not up to the standards the band required. They chose Rod Evans instead, who was already the singer of the club band The Maze. Evans brought along after the audition his 19-year-old bandmate Ian Paice, a drummer whom Blackmore recognised from his days in Hamburg. They quickly improvised an audition for Paice and he was chosen on the spot to replace Woodman behind the drum kit. Woodman was unhappy with the direction the band was heading and the other members thought that he was not suited for their sound.The first rehearsals of what would be known as the Mk. I line-up of Deep Purple involved mostly jamming and some work on the instrumentals \"And the Address\" and \"Mandrake Root\", which Blackmore and Lord had written earlier that year. Mandrake Root was also the name of an earlier band that Blackmore had been trying to form in Germany, before being contacted by Roundabout's management. After the two instrumentals, the first proper song to be arranged was \"Help!\", a Beatles cover that Chris Curtis wanted to include in an eventual album. Evans wrote some lyrics for \"Mandrake Root\" and reduced to one the number of instrumental tracks. Having arranged and rehearsed the first three songs, the musicians focused their attention on \"I'm So Glad\", a song by Skip James which had earlier been covered by Cream and The Maze. The next addition during rehearsals was \"Hey Joe\", a song originally, but disputably, written by Billy Roberts and mistakenly credited to Deep Purple on original releases of the album. The main inspiration for the new arrangement of the song was the 1966 hit version by American guitarist Jimi Hendrix, but the track length was stretched with the inclusion of classical-influenced instrumental sections. The band also selected a pop rock song called \"Hush\", written by Joe South for Billy Joe Royal the previous year, which Blackmore had heard while in Germany."

They had met years before, when both worked for producer Joe Meek and Lawrence ran an independent production company that recorded singles for release in the United States. Lawrence had many contacts in the US and was present at some of Roundabout's sessions, remaining impressed.Through Lawrence, HEC Enterprises contacted the new American record label Tetragrammaton Records, which was looking for a British band to work with. HEC arranged for the band to cut some demos for the American label in late March and early April at Trident Studios in London. They taped two of their previously developed songs, \"Hush\" and \"Help!\", as well as two new songs: \"Love Help Me\" had already been developed before Evans and Paice joined, while \"Shadows\" was quickly written and arranged by the band for those recording sessions. Lawrence also played the demo of \"Help!\" to the British recording company EMI, which offered a deal for distribution in Europe with its sub-label Parlophone. All the demos, with the exception of \"Shadows\", were sent to Tetragrammaton for approval.The recording of the demos was followed by a short promotional tour of eight dates in Denmark and Sweden through April and May, booked as Roundabout by a friend of Lord. The band name was changed at this time, after Blackmore suggested the title of his grandmother's favourite song, \"Deep Purple\" by Peter DeRose. Deep Purple played their first gig at the venue of Vestpoppen - a club set up on Parkskolen - a school and youthclub on 76 Parkvej in Taastrup, Denmark on 20 April 1968 and the live set comprised all the new songs and the cover of \"Little Girl\", originally by John Mayall and Eric Clapton. When they returned to England, Tetragrammaton confirmed the decision to sign the band. This was a saving grace, because HEC had spent nearly all their budget for promotion and equipment. The band relocated to Highleigh Manor, in Balcombe, West Sussex, because Deeves Hall was no longer available.While the band was on tour, some studio time had been booked and on Saturday, 11 May 1968, Deep Purple went into Pye Studios at ATV House in London. There, with Lawrence producing and Barry Ainsworth acting as engineer, they recorded the recently gigged material using a four-track tape machine. It was custom in those years, especially for debut bands, to have small production budgets, which allowed very limited time in the recording studio. Under these conditions it was difficult to do many overdubs and the songs were recorded live in one or two takes. \"And the Address\" and \"Hey Joe\" were cut first, followed by \"Hush\" and \"Help!\" later the first day. On Sunday, \"Love Help Me\", \"I'm So Glad\" (with a classical music prelude entitled \"Happiness\") and \"Mandrake Root\" were recorded. Finally, on Monday, 13 May, \"One More Rainy Day\" was cut, completing the recording of the album. Sound effects extracted from a BBC album were added as transitions between songs during mixing, which was completed later the same day."

        "content": "The finished album was taken to Tetragrammaton's representatives in London, who approved its release. After the final approval, the band members were dressed in fashionable costumes at the Mr. Fish Emporium, where they did a photo-shoot. The resulting shots were shipped with the master tapes to America where Tetragrammaton began production and distribution of the album. The cover design by Les Weisbrich allegedly cost half a million dollars.The single \"Hush\" was released overseas in June 1968 and it turned out to be a huge success, garnering the band considerable attention and peaking at No. 4 on the US charts and at No. 2 on the Canadian charts. The label's reluctance to release \"Help!\" as the promotional single and instead go for \"Hush\", proved ingenious. Widely distributed and hyped, the song was played on radios all over the US, particularly the West Coast, and the band's fame grew considerably. The album was released in the United States in July 1968 and reached No. 24 on the Billboard Pop Chart.\n\n\"Hush\" was released in the UK in late July, but it did not attract much interest. In August, an appearance on British TV at the David Frost Show to lip-sync the song was shot with the roadie Mick Angus standing in for an unavailable Blackmore. However, their presence on TV did not help the sales of the single in the UK and made Parlophone postpone the release of the album.The band recorded some radio sessions for the John Peel's Top Gear radio show on BBC, but otherwise, England in general was not their priority. Those recordings recently resurfaced and are included in the compilation album BBC Sessions 1968\u20131970. Shades of Deep Purple was finally released in the United Kingdom with much simpler cover art in September 1968 and went almost unnoticed there. Jon Lord, in an interview with the magazine Beat Instrumental, reflected on the scarce receptivity of England to his group and on how lucky the band was to be signed to an American label that gave Deep Purple \"far greater freedom both financially and artistically\" than they \"could ever have got with a British company\", which \"as a rule won't spend any time or effort with you until you're an established name\".A monaural pressing of the album was released in the UK and Europe, which was simply a fold-down of the stereo mix.Shades of Deep Purple was reissued many times all over the world, often in a set with the two following albums recorded by the Mk. I line-up. Besides the original issues, the most significant version of the album is the Remastered CD edition released in 2000 by EMI, which contains as bonus tracks previously unreleased recordings from the first demos in April 1968 and from TV show appearances. All the songs were digitally remastered and restored by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios in London, cutting off the sound effects used as transitions in the original edition."

        "content": "Deep Purple's members were experienced musicians with different musical backgrounds: Lord had trained in classical music and had played in jazz and blues rock ensembles, Blackmore and Simper came from session work in pop rock, Paice and Evans from beat bands. However, no one was an accomplished songwriter. The only one with experience in musical composition was Lord, who wrote the arrangements and the bulk of the music for the first album, with some guitar riffs added by Blackmore. The album shows the potential of the band but does not focus on a distinct sound. Clearly identifiable on the album are the musical styles which were developing in the UK in that period and that influenced the young musicians in Deep Purple, a mix of psychedelic rock, progressive rock, pop rock and hard rock, the latter mostly evident in Blackmore's guitar parts.Traces of the heavy sound that would mark the production of Deep Purple's \"Mk. II\" line-up (when Evans and Simper were replaced by Gillan and Roger Glover) can already be heard in the opening instrumental \"And the Address\" and in \"Mandrake Root\". The main riff of the latter is very similar to the one in the song \"Foxy Lady\", a testimony of Blackmore's admiration for Jimi Hendrix. The other original compositions, the ballad \"One More Rainy Day\" and \"Love Help Me\", are pop rock songs that enhance the commercial appeal of the album, but are considered by critics less interesting than the cover songs.\n\nThe use of so many cover songs to fill up the album was a common feature at the time, because of the short time given to bands for songwriting and for the rushed schedules of production. The songs covered in the album were all treated with new arrangements to be considerably longer and sound more grandiose than the originals, in an attempt to emulate the American rock band Vanilla Fudge, which many Deep Purple members admired. \"Hush\" and \"Help!\" are clear examples of the \"Vanilla Fudge style of slowing a song down and bluesing it up\" to get a more psychedelic sound. The sound of the band was also heavily influenced by classical music: \"I'm So Glad\" is introduced by \"Prelude: Happiness\", featuring an electric arrangement inspired by the first movement of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's symphonic suite Scheherazade; the cover of \"Hey Joe\" was arranged inserting parts taken from the Miller's Dance, suite no. 2, part 2 of El sombrero de tres picos ballet by Manuel de Falla, on a rhythm reminiscent of the Bol\u00e9ro by Maurice Ravel."

        "content": "Deep Purple's live shows were from the start very loud and hard rocking and their stage set included stacks of custom purple vinyl Marshall amps and fancy dresses. The dualism between Blackmore's flamboyant guitar playing, which he had honed in many years of daily practice and experimented on tour with Sutch, and Lord's rocking Hammond solos was still in an embryonic stage, but it would soon become an integral part of the band's dynamics.Deep Purple debuted at The Roundhouse Theatre in London on 6 July 1968, opening for The Byrds, before The Gun and The Deviants. Their performance was badly received by the audience and by other attending musicians, including Mick Jagger. In spite of this, the band went on playing their live set in local pubs and festivals, but were received coldly and ignored by the press. In an interview with Melody Maker, Ian Paice explained that their lack of touring and promotion in England was due to the low wages they were offered and to the fact that they had very few danceable numbers to attract audience. He stressed that \"we make a point of warning promoters that we are not a dancing group.\"Waiting to start their first US tour and in need of new material to be offered on the American market and to beef up their live show, the band returned to the studio with producer Derek Lawrence to record their second album, The Book of Taliesyn, in August 1968. The new album was recorded before the release of Shades of Deep Purple in the UK.\nBy October, Deep Purple set off to the States to start their US tour. The success of \"Hush\" was a giant boost in America and from their first gigs they received all the attention they had not been given in England. The first dates were at The Inglewood Forum on 18 and 19 October 1968, supporting Cream in their farewell tour. A recording of those live performances was released in 2002 with the title Inglewood \u2013 Live in California. The band played at many different locations, including festivals and bars, and made several TV appearances, including Playboy After Dark and even The Dating Game where, in addition to the band performing, Jon Lord appeared as a contestant. While the Playboy After Dark episode has survived in the archives, the Dating Game episode is now lost.\nThe songs of this album were performed regularly by the Mk. I formation of Deep Purple, but only \"Hush\", \"Help!\" and \"Hey Joe\" found space for a limited time in the live shows of the Mk. II line-up in 1969. However, \"Mandrake Root\", in an expanded and mainly instrumental version, was a staple in Mk. II live shows up until 1972, and the instrumental sections of the song survived even longer, being annexed to live versions of the Machine Head recording \"Space Truckin'\". The opening chords of \"And the Address\" were used into the Mk. II era as an introduction to the song \"Speed King\". \"Hush\" was re-recorded in 1988 and is still an integral part of the live set of the current formation of the band."

        "content": "Reception of the album and the band in their home country was generally negative. \nDespite being presented as a \"polished commercial group\" in their radio appearances, Deep Purple's stage excesses and success in the US did not make a good impression on British audiences. The Deviants frontman and later journalist Mick Farren described Deep Purple's music as \"a slow and pompous din, somewhere between bad Tchaikovsky and a B-52 taking off on a bombing run\". They were also criticised for being too American and the \"poor man's Vanilla Fudge\". As Brian Connolly of Sweet recalled, \"they were so out of place that you really felt sorry for them.\"By contrast, in the US the band was often introduced as \"the English Vanilla Fudge\" and massive radio coverage of their songs granted success for both the album and tour. Ian Paice said of their success in the US versus their lack of it back home, \"We have been given proper exposure over there. The Americans really know how to push records.\"Decades later, modern critical reviews of the album are generally positive. Bruce Eder of AllMusic considers Shades of Deep Purple, despite some flaws, \"a hell of an album\" and praises the \"infectious ... spirit of fun\" of the disc, which has \"much more of a '60s feel than we're accustomed to hearing from this band\". Blogcritics contributor David Bowling states that Shades of Deep Purple \"was a creative and very good debut album\", which combines \"psychedelic music with hard rock and early progressive rock into a pleasant but disjointed whole\". PopMatters review of the three albums of the Mk. I line-up considers them \"both respectable and consistent\", although Evans' voice is \"perhaps more suited to heavy pop rather than heavy rock\". Canadian journalist Martin Popoff described this early incarnation of Deep Purple as a \"hard psych band\", more committed to the music than other contemporaries and already capable of creating \"a noise that definitetly foretold of things to come.\"In an Observer Music Monthly Greatest British Albums poll, keyboard player Rick Wakeman chose Shades of Deep Purple as his favourite British record of all time."

The contest, originally titled the Gran Premio Eurovisione 1956 della Canzone Europea (English: Grand Prix of the Eurovision Song Competition; French: Grand Prix Eurovision de la Chanson Europ\u00e9enne 1956), was held on Thursday 24 May 1956 at the Teatro Kursaal in Lugano, Switzerland, and hosted by Swiss television presenter Lohengrin Filipello, which remains the only time that the contest has been hosted by a solo male presenter.\nInspired principally by the Italian Sanremo Music Festival, held annually since 1951, the concept of a televised European song contest, initially proposed by Italian broadcaster RAI, was formulated by an EBU committee led by Swiss broadcaster and executive Marcel Bezen\u00e7on. Following approval at the EBU's General Assembly in 1955, the rules and structure of the contest were agreed upon. Several of the rules utilised in this first contest would subsequently be altered for future editions, and it remains the only edition in which each country was represented by two songs, with a voting process which was held in secret and where juries could vote for the entries from their own country.\nSeven countries participated in the inaugural edition of the contest, and the first winner was the host country Switzerland, with the song \"Refrain\" performed by Lys Assia. The result was determined by an assembled jury composed of two jurors from each country, with each juror ranking each song between 1 and 10 points. Only the winning country and song were announced at the conclusion of the event, with the results of the remaining participants unknown. Even though it was broadcast on television and radio via the Eurovision network in ten countries, no video footage of the event is known to exist, with the only video available being of the reprise performance from an independent archiver; the majority of the broadcast is, however, available in audio."

The word \"Eurovision\" was first used as a telecommunications term in the United Kingdom in 1951, in reference to a programme by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) being relayed by Dutch television, and was subsequently used as the title for the union's new transmission network upon its creation in 1954. Following the formation of the EBU, a number of notable events were transmitted through its networks in several European countries, including Belgium, France, West Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. A series of international exchange programmes were subsequently organised for 1954, with this \"European Television Season\" relayed live across Europe through the Eurovision network.Following this series of transmissions, a \"Programme Committee\" was set up within the EBU to investigate new initiatives for cooperation between broadcasters each year, with Marcel Bezen\u00e7on of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR) serving as the committee's first president. This committee agreed to study the concept for a new televised European song contest during a meeting in January 1955, a concept initially proposed by the Italian broadcaster RAI and inspired by the broadcaster's Sanremo Music Festival, held annually since 1951. The new European contest was subsequently approved at the EBU's annual General Assembly in October 1955, leading to the creation of the European Grand Prix."

In addition Switzerland made a logical choice from a technical perspective for the hosting of what was an experiment in live, simultaneous, cross-border transmissions, as its geographically central location in Europe facilitated terrestrial broadcasts across the continent, as well as being the host country for the EBU's headquarters.Taking its inspiration from the Italian Sanremo Music Festival and Venice International Song Festival, a similar EBU-organised song contest held in 1955 and broadcast on radio, Lugano in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino was chosen as the first host city by SRG SSR. The selected venue for the contest was the Teatro Kursaal, a casino and former theatre situated on Lake Lugano. The theatre, used for theatrical and musical performances, ballroom dance and other shows, closed shortly after featuring its last performance in April 1997 before being demolished in 2001 to make room for the extension of the casino."

        "content": "A planning sub-group, headed by Eduard Hass of SRG SSR, was formed following the sign-off on the organisation of the event to build out the rules of the competition. Taking inspiration from the Sanremo Music Festival and the Venice International Song Festival as a basis in planning the new contest, the group made several amendments and additions to these rules to suit its international nature. Ideas suggested but ultimately rejected during this planning phase included featuring each song a second time with a piano accompaniment instead of orchestral backing, as well as technical initiatives such as a separate producer from each participating country involved in the contest's organisation. Prize money for the winners was also ruled out at this stage. The rules of the contest were finalised and distributed to EBU members in early 1956. The rules set out in detail the criteria for the participating songs and performers; production details and requirements; timelines for the submission of materials by the participating broadcasters; the method by which the winning song would be determined; details related to the financing of the event; and the responsibilities which lay with the host broadcaster and the participating broadcasters.The inaugural Eurovision Song Contest was produced by the Italian-language radio broadcaster Radio svizzera italiana (RSI), in cooperation with the German-language television broadcaster Schweizer Fernsehen der deutschen und r\u00e4toromanischen Schweiz (SF DRS), which brought a television production truck from Z\u00fcrich to Lugano. Franco Marazzi served as director of the event on behalf of RSI, with Rolf Liebermann overseeing the production and the jury deliberations on behalf of the EBU as its executive supervisor and jury president.Per the rules of the contest, each participating country, represented by one EBU member organisation, submitted into the contest a maximum of two songs not exceeding three to three-and-a-half minutes in duration, which must have been solely original compositions. Each participating organisation had sole discretion on how to select their entries for the contest but were strongly encouraged by the EBU to hold their own national contests to determine their representatives. Following the performance of all songs, the winner was determined by an assembled jury composed of two individuals from each country, with each individual member rating secretly each song between one and ten points, including those representing their own country, with higher scores given to more appreciated songs. The jury followed the contest in a separate room in the same venue in Lugano through a small television screen, replicating the conditions as close as possible to how viewers at home would watch the contest. The winning song was thus that which gained the highest score from the votes of all jury members. In the event of a tie between two or more entries all songs with the highest score would have been declared winners.In news reports at the time, according to one Dutch juror, the jury members were removed from the jury room once they had cast their votes and were therefore unable to follow the tabulation of the final results. The jury members from Luxembourg were unable to attend the contest in Lugano, and subsequently the EBU allowed two Swiss nationals to vote in their place. This would remain the only contest in which many of these rules would be utilised, and several changes were made ahead of the 1957 contest. These included restricting each country to only one song, expanding the number of performers allowed to participate for each country, introducing a more visible voting system, and restricting each country from voting for their own entry.Each song was accompanied by a 24-piece orchestra, with members of the Radiosa Orchestra supplemented by strings of the Italian Swiss Radio Symphony Orchestra, presided over by the contest's musical director, Fernando Paggi. Each participating country was allowed to supplement the orchestra with their own musical director for the performances of their country, with the host musical director also conducting for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. Participating broadcasters were required to submit to the EBU by 10 May 1956 scores for the participating songs for use by the orchestra, audio recordings for each participating song, and copies of the song lyrics for each song in the original language, as well as translations into French or English to aid the jury members and commentators. The confirmed selection of each country's musical director (if separate to that of the host) was required to be communicated between 21 and 24 May. Rehearsals in the contest venue with the competing artists and the orchestra began on 21 May 1956.According to the rules, the order in which the countries and songs were performed was to be determined artistically by the Swiss broadcasters, with input and support by the musical directors from each country. However, a draw determining the order of countries seems to have taken place in Gardone (Italy) a few days prior to the contest."

This remains the only time in which the contest was hosted by a solo male presenter, and one of only two contests not to feature a female presenter, alongside the 2017 contest held 61 years later. Additionally this would remain the only contest to feature a male presenter for 22 years, until the 1978 contest featured a male and female presenting duo.During the interval between the final competing act and the announcement of the winner, performances by Les Joyeux Rossignols and Les Trois M\u00e9nestrels were featured to entertain the audience, with the latter performing \"Guerre de Troie\" along with other works. Upon the announcement of the results, the winning artist returned to the stage for a reprise performance of the winning song to end the broadcast.The winning song was \"Refrain\", composed by G\u00e9o Voumard, written by \u00c9mile Gardaz, performed by Lys Assia and representing the host country Switzerland. During the reprise performance of the winning song, Assia became emotional and suffered a lapse in memory of the song's lyrics, subsequently requesting a restart by the orchestra. After the show, a reception for the participating delegations was held in the upper hall of Teatro Kursaal.The full results of the contest were not revealed at the time, with only the winning song named at the end of the show by the jury president Rolf Liebermann; the full breakdown of each juror's votes has not been retained by the EBU, and is presumed lost. Attempts to reconstruct the voting through interviews with jury members have also failed to reveal a reliable result. An article in Italian newspaper La Stampa published on 25 May 1956, the day after the contest, reported that Switzerland's winning entry received 102 points in total, while in a post-contest interview with Stelio Molo, the Director General of SRG SSR, published in the Italian magazine Settimana Radio TV in the weeks following the contest, the gap between the first- and second-placed songs was revealed by Molo to be two points, and that the remaining entries also finished close to the winner.

It is about a Flemish boy named Nello and his dog, Patrasche, and is set in Antwerp.\nIn Japan, Korea, Russia, Ukraine and the Philippines, the novel has been a popular children's classic for decades and has been adapted into several Japanese films and anime. Since the 1980s, the Belgian board of tourism noticed the phenomenon and built two monuments honoring the story to attract East-Asian tourists. There is a small statue of Nello and Patrasche at the Kapelstraat in the Antwerp suburb of Hoboken, and a commemorative plaque in front of the Antwerp Cathedral donated by Toyota, that was later replaced by a marble statue of the two characters covered by a cobblestone blanket, created by the artist Batist Vermeulen."

        "content": "In 19th-century Belgium, a boy named Nello becomes an orphan at the age of two when his mother dies in the Ardennes. His impoverished grandfather, Jehan Daas, who lives in a small village near the city of Antwerp, takes him in.\nOne day, Nello and Jehan find a dog that was almost beaten to death, and name him \"Patrasche\". Due to the good care and kindness shown to him by Jehan, the dog recovers its health, and from then on, Nello and Patrasche are inseparable. Nello is forced to work as a milk seller, because Jehan's unnamed, crooked landlord demands that he pay more rent money or face eviction. Patrasche helps Nello pull his small milk cart into town each morning.\nNello falls in love with Aloise, the daughter of Baas Cogez, a well-off man in the village, but Baas objects, as he doesn't want his daughter to have a poor sweetheart. Although Nello is illiterate, he is very talented in drawing. He enters a junior drawing contest in Antwerp, hoping to win the first prize of 200 francs per year; however, the jury selects a different winner.\nSometime later, a fire breaks out on Baas's property. To escape responsibility for neglecting the property, the landlord lies and suggests that Nello was responsible for the fire; Baas then tells Nello that he is never to see Aloise again. Later, Jehan dies, and the landlord promptly evicts Nello and Patrasche. With no home, they are forced to wander the streets.\nDistraught and miserable, Nello decides that he wants to go to the cathedral of Antwerp, to see Rubens' The Elevation of the Cross and The Descent from the Cross \u2014 but the exhibition in the cathedral is only for paying customers, and he has no money left. On the night of Christmas Eve, Nello and Patrasche find that the door to the church has been left unlocked. They go inside, and the next morning are found dead of hypothermia in front of the triptych."

        "content": "The novel shares a reasonable notability in both the United Kingdom and the United States and is extremely popular in Ukraine, Russia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines to the point where it is seen as a children's classic. It inspired film and anime adaptations, including the 1975 animated TV series Dog of Flanders which reached an audience of 30 million viewers on its first broadcast.In Belgium, the story is more obscure. Only in 1987 did it receive a Dutch translation; this happened after the tale was adapted into a story of the popular comic book series Suske en Wiske. Since then, monuments were raised to commemorate Nello and Patrasche to please tourists. In 2007, Didier Volckaert and An van Dienderen directed a documentary about the international popularity of the story: Patrasche, A Dog of Flanders - Made in Japan. It researches all available film adaptations of the story and interviews several British, American and Japanese people about what attracts them to this novel."

Rockdelux's brief was to serve a specific section of the public who are passionate about music, and its focus was on new and more alternative artists from both Spain and the outside world (termed \"international\").\nIt had an extensive review section, covering mainly new musical releases and re-releases, but also covered other music-related subjects such as live concerts and videos and featured reviews of new books and graphic novels. Unlike many other review sections in popular magazines, it eschewed the trend of giving a numerical value to each review, which are purely composed of written text summing up the release's values.\nFrom 1987 Santi Carrillo was the editor-in-chief of the magazine. Rockdelux was the recipient of various awards for music publication of the year from such organisations as Radio 3, Cadena SER and Iberpop amongst others.\nIn April 1999, Rockdelux began to issue complimentary CDs as a free gift with the magazine, each one generally acting as a sampler for a particular record label, such as Warp Records, Fierce Panda Records and Sub Pop records.\nThe final issue (#394) was published in May 2020."

The complaint cited a column in which Palacio stated that Correa had permitted soldiers to fire on a hospital to suppress a violent police protest. A temporary magistrate who heard the case granted the president US$42 million in damages. The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court on 17 February 2012, but was suspended by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights four days later pending further review.The decision caused significant international criticism from newspapers, human rights groups, and press freedom organizations. An editorial in The New York Times described the verdict as \"a staggering, shameful blow to the country's democracy\", while Reporters Without Borders called it \"draconian\" and a \"grave legal precedent\". Correa, in contrast, described the verdict as a blow to the \"dictatorship\" of a corrupt press.On 27 February 2012, Correa pardoned the four defendants, stating that he had \"never wanted this trial\" but only wanted the public to know the truth. Later that year, the newspaper was awarded the inter-American Maria Moors Cabot prize. The citation read, \"Even in the face of Correa's bullying and the threat of incarceration, El Universo and many other Ecuadoran journalists have courageously defended their right and obligation to speak out for a democratic society.\""

        "content": "Here I Am is the third studio album by American singer Kelly Rowland, released through Universal Motown and Universal Music Group on July 22, 2011. The album is Rowland's first release since parting ways with her manager Mathew Knowles and longtime Sony Music record label Columbia Records (through Knowles' Music World Entertainment). Here I Am is predominately a pop, R&B and dance album. It follows Rowland's assertion that \"no one puts her in a box\" with common themes around womanhood, sexual intimacy and love. Originally scheduled for release in 2010, the album was pushed back after the first round of singles were released to mixed critical and commercial reception.\n\"Commander\" (2010) produced by and featuring David Guetta topped the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and became a top-ten hit in the United Kingdom and some other European territories. Three other singles: \"Forever and a Day\", \"Rose Colored Glasses\" and \"Grown Woman\", all had limited commercial success and are subsequently included on selected editions of the album or excluded altogether. The international version of the album features seventeen songs including ones excluded from the US editions and some remixes. Here I Am also features guest performances from Lil Wayne, Nelly, Rico Love, Lil Playy, The WAV.s and Big Sean. Production of the album was handled by the likes of Rodney Jerkins, Guetta, Jim Jonsin, Hit-Boy, RedOne and The Runners. Love wrote half of the songs on the album, while Rowland co-wrote three songs on the album.\nAfter re-recording the majority of the album, a new single featuring Lil Wayne titled \"Motivation\", preceded the album in the United States. It was greeted with a positive reception from critics and topped the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart as well as peaking in the top-twenty of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Rowland's second most successful single as a lead artist in the United States. Here I Am was received well by critics, many of whom praised the strong productions and vocal performances but questioned some of the guests and a lack of the up-tempo dance sound Rowland had spoken of. Here I Am debuted at number one on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number three on the US Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 147,000  copies. To date, it's Rowland's highest debuting album in the United States."

        "content": "During her 2008 performances at T4 on the Beach in Weston-Super-Mare, United Kingdom, Rowland was exposed to British bands and live festival music. It inspired her to pursue a new sound for her then untitled third album. She then travelled the South of France for vacation in Summer 2008 where she was exposed to dance music. It was here that she met French disc jockey (DJ) David Guetta and heard the foundations of \"When Love Takes Over\", a song that would leave a lasting impression on the singer. After falling in love with the song, Rowland would take it back to London to write and record the vocals with Australian songwriters, The Nervo Twins. However Columbia Records were not impressed with the new sound and the record was left unfinished until it was rediscovered by Guetta, when compiling his One Love album.In March 2009, it was revealed that the singer was parting ways with Columbia Records. Speaking of her decision to leave, Rowland said, \"as a solo artist, I felt the need to explore new directions, new challenges, and new freedoms outside my comfort zone and my friends and family at Columbia have been incredibly understanding about my evolution. I want to thank everyone at Columbia for the love and support they've shown and I will never forget how many good times we've had over the years.\" It was also announced in March that Guetta was releasing \"When Love Takes Over\", his collaboration with Rowland. The song went on to be a worldwide success for the duo. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said \"the success comes at an intriguing time in Rowland's career\", having noted that she had landed a hosting job on Bravo's The Fashion Show and was in between labels.In October 2009 it was suggested that the success of the single had made Rowland consider signing a new record deal with EMI Music. Despite earlier claims, Rowland told Entertainment Weekly in 2010 that she didn't leave Columbia Records of her own accord. She was dropped because her previous album, Ms. Kelly (2007), was not commercially successful. Then in May 2010, speculation of Rowland's new record ended when an official press release revealed that she had signed to Universal Motown Records. It was whilst recording within the studios with Guetta that Rowland caught the attention of the head of Universal Motown, Sylvia Rhone, which led to the new deal. On the decision to go with Rhone's label, Rowland said \"they have really embraced me and have set me up to succeed. I decided, after careful thought, to sign with Universal Motown not only because of their track record of success, but also because they truly put their artists first\". Here I Am has a distinctly different sound to Rowland's previous albums. Simply Deep (2002) followed a rock\u2013dance sound, while Ms. Kelly featured an urban sound. However, on her third album, there are a lot of up-tempo tracks. The album is tailored specifically towards individual markets, with the US version of the album featuring more traditional R&B and pop records, while the international version of the album features more of an \"up-tempo dancey\" sound."

        "content": "In an interview with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two records she struggled to find her sound. \"I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [and management] wanted me to try it and I did it... And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007.\" She further described the songs on her previous albums as sounding very much the same, which led her to the realisation that she \"needed refreshing\". She told Entertainment Focus that meeting French DJ David Guetta \"changed her perspective and helped to inspire the new sound\". She then spent more time in Europe in 2009, something which she said had influenced her. \"It's different being over here in Europe and just being able to look at different magazines and fashion shows and things like that. And just thinking about the look and working with different stylists as well. I wanted to make sure it was a look that was all me, you know?.\" She noted that seeing people's reactions to dance music made her feel \"completely intoxicated!.\" In July 2010, Rowland said during an interview with Alex Catarinella of Paper magazine that \"I spent about a year of my life in Europe really listening to a whole bunch of European DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really loving it. 'When Love Takes Over' was my first introduction to dance music [and] it was a whole other monster. It's really a culture and I love it.\"\n\nWhen she was interviewed for Blues & Soul in 2010, Rowland explained that the album would blend her urban roots with a strong dance music influence. \"I'd say the main difference between this new album and my previous albums, is that this time I wasn't afraid to take a risk. I didn't care whether it was urban, dance, hip hop, WHATEVER... I just wanted a great track that I could sing and that people would enjoy.\" Part of the inspiration for the new sound on the album was wanting to do something different. In her interview with The Independent, she said \"For me, it was being kind of at a flat line with urban music and wanting something different ... when I did 'When Love Takes Over', it was easy to do it \u2013 it was almost like it happened before me in spirit and I walked right into it. ...so I knew I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction.\" Then in response to criticisms that her long-standing fans would not have their expectations met, she said \"I did not forget about my urban roots, nor will I ever ... That is one of the reasons I am here period ... I thank everyone for being so wonderful and so open to me trying something new. I won't let you down this record, I promise you.\"She expressed frustrations with the constant comparisons to Beyonc\u00e9 and opinions that urban artists should only produce urban records. Defending her decision to widen the range of genres on the new album, she said \"Nobody puts me in a box!.\" Alex Cantaranella of Paper magazine described her position on the album as \"an unassuming, poised woman who isn't fazed by the 'bullshit that comes with the territory'.\" Rowland would go on to say that the album was \"a mixture of different sounds that express me and where I'm at right now in my career\", and promised that the album would be a \"defining moment\" in her career.\nUpon completion of the album, Rowland said: \"I'm so excited for everyone to hear the rest of the album. For a long time, I thought about, 'Should it be dance or should it be urban or should it be this or should it be that?' And I was like, 'Why am I allowing people to make me think like that?\" She added, \"It's just about artistry, it's just about freedom,\" she continued. \"It's just about music. It's about being alive and being happy and living life and being a woman, just feeling amazing...\""

        "content": "Sessions took place in Los Angeles, New York City and Miami with Rowland specifically wanting a wide range of songs to choose from.One of the first people she actually entered the studios with was David Guetta. He co-wrote and produced the song, \"Commander\", a song with themes of taking control and being sexy. Rowland said of the song, \"I hope to see women singing the song like they're in charge. It's important to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny.\" Rico Love wrote the song and, according to Rowland, had credits on around half of the album. \"Commander\" features on the album as track number nine, while its urban remix featuring Nelly features on the deluxe edition as track fourteen. Guetta also had a hand in co-producing \"Forever and a Day\" with Danish producer Jonas Jeberg. The song was written by Sam Watters, Andre Merrit, Jeberg and Rowland. During the album's New York listening party in June 2010, \"Forever and Day\" was described by Honey Mag as a display of Rowland's \"vocals\" with \"long-winded riffs and sky-high notes.\" It was released as a single in some international markets in September 2010. Aside from Guetta, Rowland was reunited with The Nervo Twins who previously helped Rowland to write \"When Love Takes Over\".\nAmerican R&B singer-songwriter Ne-Yo was also involved in the album and wrote three songs which were produced by StarGate. \"Shake Them Haters Off\" is an \"up-tempo\" and fun record with lyrics such as \"Its like a job I that I never get a break from/because haters never take a vacation.\" Another collaboration titled \"Grown Ass Woman\" (later changed to \"Grown Woman\") was described by Rowland as her favorite song on the album. Ne-Yo conceptualized the song in a three-minute conversation with Rowland, where she told him she wanted a record where she could claim \"I'm grown!\". According to Janine Simon from Honey Mag, on \"Grown [Ass] Woman\" Rowland digs \"through old pictures from the Destiny's Child days reflecting on how far she has come yet how 'Grown and silly' she still is.\" It would later be released as one of the album's two US lead singles. The pair collaborated on a third song, \"Heaven n Earth\", described by Simon as a ballad using imagery to demonstrate a \"sonic portrait, painted with flecks of sentiment; a picture of what the singer believes is what 'we deserve as a people'.\" According to Rowland, one of these three records was also recorded as a duet featuring Ne-Yo's vocals. None of these songs made the album apart from \"Heaven n Earth\", which features as song number eleven on the deluxe edition.Ester Dean and Dr. Luke also worked on the album, respectively writing and producing the other US lead single \"Rose Colored Glasses\". The song's lyrics portray \"the issues that arise when one plays the fool in a relationship.\" During Rowland's concert series for iHeartRadio, the singer took time out to reflect on the song. She recalled, \"The first time I heard the song it made me think of all of the relationships where I had to wear rose-colored glasses.\" It was also revealed that, during the studio recording session with Dean, she began to cry at the thought of all the \"toxic relationships\" she had been in \"where she needed to leave.\" Later in an interview with The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland said that the song had taken its toll on her. She said \"It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen.\" Dean also worked alongside Rowland during last minute studio sessions with producer Tricky Stewart, which spawned a female empowerment song called \"I'm Dat Chick\". Although \"Rose Colored Glasses\" was omitted from the US track listing, Dean's song \"I'm Dat Chick\" made the album appearing as the opening song. Written as a \"confidence-boosting\" anthem, \"I'm Dat Chick\" is built around an urban-electro club beat designed to get \"even shy women to come out of their shells\" according to Rap-Up magazine. Meanwhile, Dean's third contribution, \"Lay It on Me\", features rapper Big Sean and centers on an up-tempo R&B melody with 808s and high NRG-led production. It features a \"tinkling piano\" melody and light R&B beat.\"Take Everything\", another song recorded for the album, is one of several songs written by Love and produced by Jim Jonsin and was the first record that Rowland recorded with the duo. Jonsin praised his studio sessions with Rowland, describing the new sound as Donna Summer-esque. During an interview with 103.5 KTU FM, she accidentally revealed she had collaborated with Pitbull, but it was not until August 15, 2010, during an interview with 97.9 The Box FM, that it was revealed that he features on \"Take Everything\". Another song written and produced by the duo is titled \"Motivation\" featuring Lil Wayne. It was released as the album's lead single in April 2011. Speaking of how the record came about, Rowland said \"'Motivation' came about when I was in the studio with [producers] Jim Jonsin and Rico Love, and we kind of were just vibing. I told Rico I wanted something really sexy ... and he came up with 'Motivation' along with Jim. It turned into this amazing record... I played [ 'Motivation' for Lil Wayne ] and he got on it, and it was just as simple as that.\" The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body, and are accompanied by a \"synth-saturated beat\" produced by Jonsin. In terms of instruments, \"Motivation\" uses sparse keyboard notes, programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus. Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland's seductive suggestions, using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex.A press release also revealed she had worked with Salaam Remi, something which Love confirmed when he said he had worked on a song with Remi called \"Love Is the Greatest\" that he hoped would make the album. Of these recordings, only \"Motivation\" made the album appearing as song number three, while its Rebel Rock Remix appears on the deluxe edition as track thirteen. Shondrae 'Bangladesh' Crawford who is best known for producing \"Diva\" and \"Video Phone\" by Rowland's ex-bandmate and close friend Beyonc\u00e9, revealed to Rap-Up that he had also been in the studio with Rowland. Of the collaborations, Bangladesh said, \"the music that we've done is just hard, it's edgy, but it's still sexy, and it's not raunchy ... What I like to do when I go in with artists, I like to recreate and reinvent 'em, even if they didn't need that.\" Another song recorded for the album was the Brian Kennedy-produced dance song \"On and On\" which was written by Kennedy, Merritt, Rowland and Robert Allen. \"On and On\" was used in episode fifteen of the MTV reality TV series The Hills. Both Bangladesh and Kennedy productions are omitted from the album.\nOther studio sessions took place with Akon, while new writing sessions were planned with season eight American Idol runner-up Adam Lambert. No songs from either Akon or Lambert appear on the US track listing. In September 2010 it was also confirmed that Stewart's fellow songwriting and production partner, The-Dream, had joined his studio sessions with Rowland. Rap-Up reported that The-Dream had been staying in New York City where he was penning songs for Rowland to record. Then on September 5, 2010, songwriter and producer Jermaine Dupri, revealed in his Living the Life series that he was in the studio with Rowland recording material for the album. In the second of these videos, songwriter Bryan-Michael Cox was also present during sessions with Rowland and Dupri. It was later revealed that the opportunity and desire to schedule more recording sessions with the duo led to the album's pushback into 2011. None of the tracks with Dupri, Cox or The-Dream made the album. In January 2011, during a trip to London, it was revealed that Gucci Mane, Lil Wayne and Rick Ross would all appear on the album. Although by the time the track listing was revealed, only Wayne's song features while rappers Mane and Ross were replaced with new songs, respectively featuring Big Sean, Lil Playy and Love.Love features on the 2 Live Crew-sampling \"All of the Night\". Using elements of \"One and One\", the steamy duet sees \"Rowland comparing her bedroom activities to music.\" Love also co-wrote and co-produced another R&B midtempo for the album titled \"Feeling Me Right Now\", where the lyrics describe what it is like to find \"self-love\" in the club. The final Love-penned song which appears on the album is titled \"Each Other\" and was co-written/co-produced by Souldiggaz. Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins scores two songs on the album, including the Lil Playy-assisted \"Work It Man\". Beginning with a strong piano riff, the song picks up its tempo resulting in a \"speaker-banger.\" The lyrics see Rowland telling listeners what kind of man she wants. \"Turn It Up\", another Darkchild production, features a synth-heavy production with lyrics about having a good time and allowing karma to deal with a cheating partner. Joseph \"Lonny\" Bereal helped Rowland and two others to co-write \"Keep It Between Us\", a song that appears as the eighth song on the album. In February 2011, during New York Fashion Week, Rowland confirmed that she also had sessions arranged with RedOne, which led to the conception of the album's tenth song, a Eurodance song called \"Down for Whatever\", co-produced by The WAV.s and Jimmy Joker.Rowland revealed in August 2010 that she would be releasing a different, \"more up-tempo dancey\" version of the album in international territories after she experienced more success with dance music internationally. With the album beginning production from as early as late 2008, Rowland completed a number of songs with a wide range of producers, some of which did not make the US version of the album. Rowland confirmed in July 2011 that the European track listing would consist of leftover songs from the album's recording sessions as well as songs from the US version and some newly recorded songs. The international version of the album features the original ten songs from the standard edition plus: \"Heaven n Earth\" and \"Each Other\" from the deluxe edition, as well as \"When Love Takes Over\" (with Guetta), \"Rose Colored Glasses\", \"Motivation (Diplo Remix)\", \"Forever and a Day\" and \"What a Feeling\" (with Alex Gaudino), all excluded from the US edition of the album."

        "content": "On June 17, 2010, Rowland held an album listening party at Hudson Hall in New York City where she revealed that her third studio album would be eponymously titled. Subsequently, during an interview with Paper magazine the following month, Rowland announced that the self-titled album would \"introduce Kelly Rowland being Kelly Rowland,\" with a wide range of records. She said, \"I'm the most confident I've been on a record ever. And it's by myself. I love it.\" Kelly Rowland was due to arrive in stores on September 14, 2010. However, just days after the interview, the singer said she was having second thoughts about the name. A facility was set up whereby fans could suggest new names through Rowland's official website. The album was also pushed back a week, though no reason was given. This would be swiftly followed by another announcement that Rowland had seized the opportunity for new studio sessions with Akon and Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart (respectively) and hence the album would now come out on October 26, 2010 The album was pushed back a fourth time, by one week with no reason give.In an interview with JLB Mornings on WJLB Radio, Rowland would go to explain that part of the reasons for the constant pushbacks were her desires to perfect the album. This was followed by another pushback to November 9, 2010, and an announcement on The Today Show that despite numerous false reports and rumors, the album was still missing a title. She said \"I saw one blog saying that the album was called One Woman Show, [and] that's totally never been the case.\" Expanding further she said that \"the title has to work with the tracks that make the record, and that's why even though there have been some good suggestions from fans I can't decide on one that fits\". Then on September 11, 2010, during New York Fashion Week, Rowland broke the news that the album was incomplete and would now be released in 2011 so that she could work with R&B songwriting and production duo Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox.\nAlso in mid-late September it was revealed that three new names had been shortlisted for the album, including one suggested by a fan. Then some eight months after revealing that three names had been shortlisted for the album, Rowland gave an exclusive interview with Billboard, where she revealed that the album would be called Here I Am. In the interview she said: \"I was talking to my product manager,... I said I wanted people to know that this is the record, the sound I've been working toward... that here I am. And she said, that's the title. It just connected with my heart and the music as well. It stands for everything I've gone through and thought about for this record as a woman. It's very strong.\" After receiving a release date of Fall 2011, the album was moved up to July 26, 2011, following the success of the album's lead single \"Motivation\". Rowland had previously said that she had intended to release two alternative versions of the album, one for the US and a more up-tempo dance version for international markets. A new version of the album was released in the United Kingdom on November 28, 2011, coinciding with Rowland's new job as a judge on series eight of The X Factor UK. Rowland released Here I Am in the UK with a performance on the show."

        "content": "The promotional trail for the project began in March 2010 when Rowland performed at Cathy Guetta's Fuck Me I'm Famous party at the Winter Music Conference in Miami. Following this, Rowland held an album listening party at Hudson Hall in New York City on June 17, 2010. During the party, Rowland was interviewed by Gayle King while introducing songs from the album. Among those played were, \"Rose Colored Glasses\", \"Shake Them Haters Off\", \"Grown [Ass] Woman\", \"Forever and a Day\" and \"Heaven n Earth\". From as far back as January 12, 2010, Rowland gave magazine interviews about the album including spreads with New!, Take 5, and Musicology magazine. In June 2010, she appeared in the United Kingdom giving interviews with various radio stations, including Gaydar. Rowland also performed at a second Fuck Me I'm Famous party, this time in Paris on June 25 and 26. She was interviewed for UK entertainment site 'Entertainment Focus' during her promotional tour in London, UK, before returning to the US on July 3, 2010, to host the Independence Day (July 4) celebrations at the Pure nightclub in Las Vegas. These performances were reprised at 103.5 KTU's Beatstock 2010 in New York on July 8 and 9. Then for a week beginning on July 26, 2010, Rowland flew to Australia to help the Optus mobile network to launch the iPhone 4. Part of the promotion included her performing a mini-concert for the network's customers. She also performed at the 2010 FlavaMen Blatino Awards afterparty.Rowland performed for an exclusive audience of fans at the Gramercy Theatre, New York City on August 26, 2010, where she played a mini-set of new and old songs, as well as performing at the 'Ladies Night' during the Atlanta Black Gay Pride weekend on September 3 to 5, 2010. However, not all of the promotion went as planned; the New York Post reported that Rowland had lip-synced during her performances at the P.C. Richard and Son Theatre for the iHeartRadio concert season. On June 26, 2011, Rowland took to the stage of the 2011 BET Awards to perform \"Motivation\" for the first time. Rowland promoted the album with live performances on televised shows, including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on July 29, 2011 and on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on September 26, 2011. Throughout September and October 2011, she was a supporting act for Chris Brown's North American leg of his F.A.M.E. Tour. A music video for the song, \"Keep It Between Us\", was released on January 25, 2012, and shows actor Lance Gross playing Rowland's love interest. In April 2012, Rowland travelled to Australia as one of the performing acts at its largest urban music festival, Supafest."

        "content": "\"Commander\" was unveiled as Here I Am's first single during the 2010 Winter Music Conference on March 27, 2010. It features and was produced by French disc jockey (DJ) David Guetta, and was released from May 17, 2010, to iTunes Stores around the world for digital download. Upon release the single was met with positive reception from music critics who praised the dance sound of the song. In the United Kingdom, \"Commander\" topped the UK Dance Chart and became a top-ten hit on the UK Singles Chart, and Rowland's best chart position since 2008. Despite not being serviced as a single in the United States, it managed to top the Hot Dance Club Songs chart.Initially in the United States, separate pop and R&B singles were planned to be serviced to radio in a dual release strategy. The first of these singles, the Dr. Luke-produced \"Rose Colored Glasses\" was serviced to contemporary hit radio and released for digital download on June 29, 2010. It received praise for showcasing a \"trademark classy, controlled delivery\" from Rowland, and \"real strength is in its story and theme, that carries an emotional weight that Commander's talk of 'dance floor loving' could never reach.\" Despite this, the single only managed to peak at number thirty-nine on the US Top 40 Airplay chart, as compiled by Media Base. The second of the aforementioned dual singles for the US market, the R&B single \"Grown Woman\", (produced by StarGate) was serviced to urban, rhythmic and urban adult contemporary radios on June 29, 2010, with a digital release coming later on. It was slightly more successful than \"Rose Colored Glasses\", managing to peak at number fifty-one in its third week on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. While \"Rose Colored Glasses\" was featured on the international edition of the album, \"Grown Woman\" was excluded from both versions. International markets were serviced with a second single, \"Forever and a Day\", that was produced by Jonas Jeberg and co-produced by Guetta. It premiered via BBC Radio 1 on August 18, 2010, and was released from September 20, 2010. Despite receiving praise of Rowland's strong vocals, the single failed to match the success of \"Commander\", peaking at number forty-nine on the UK Singles Chart.After the failed attempt to launch the album with the dual US releases of \"Rose Colored Glasses\" and \"Grown Woman\", Rowland announced that the album would be rebooted with a brand new lead single for the US market. In March 2011, Rowland released the new lead single \"Motivation\" featuring Lil Wayne, replacing the previous lead singles. It was produced by Jim Jonsin with a synth-saturated beat. The single was praised for its sex appeal, and upon release peaked at number seventeen on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as peaking at number one on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. \"Motivation\" became Rowland's highest-charting single on the R&B format as a solo lead artist, and achieved the highest Hot 100 debut of her career. Ultimately it became Rowland's second-highest-charting single, and the only single from Here I Am to chart on the Hot 100.The next US single was \"Lay It on Me\" featuring rapper Big Sean. Billboard described \"Lay It on Me\" is an uptempo song, led by an 808 and a hi-NRG piano introduction with production by Hitboy. The single received positive praise from critics, who felt it was catchy and sexy. \"Lay It on Me\" was sent to rhythmic radio on August 16, 2011, and to urban radio on September 6, 2011. The video for \"Lay It on Me\" was filmed in early September 2011, and was directed by British fashion photographer/director Sarah Chatfield and choreographer Frank Gatson, Jr., both of whom had worked with Rowland on the video for \"Motivation\". The music video was released on October 12, 2011. The next international single was the RedOne-produced \"Down for Whatever\" featuring The WAV.s. The music video for \"Down for Whatever\" was also filmed in early September 2011 and directed by Chatfield and Gatson, Jr. \"Down for Whatever\" impacted UK radio on September 16, 2011 and the music video was released on October 18, 2011. \"Down for Whatever\" was released in New Zealand and Australia on October 26, 2011, in Germany on November 4, 2011, and in the UK on November 20, 2011. The music video for the single \"Keep It Between Us\" was filmed in November 2011 in Paris; actor Lance Gross plays Rowland's love interest in the video."

        "content": "Here I Am received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on sixteen reviews, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\". AllMusic editor Andy Kellman gave Here I Am four out of five stars and complimented its  appeal to \"hip-hop and R&B\" radio, adding that \"Although very eclectic taste is required to appreciate in full, this is clearly Rowland's brightest, most confident album yet.\" Entertainment Weekly's Adam Markovitz gave Here I Am a B rating and called it \"a solid if unambitious set of medium-hot finger snappers.\" Simon Gage from the Daily Express called Here I Am a \"jumping\" collection of up-tempo songs comparable to Donna Summer, but \"broadly much tougher and maybe just a tad over-processed.\" Gage added that Rowland could include Here I Am amongst her other career highlights such as her singles \"Work\" (2008) and \"When Love Takes Over\" (2009 collaboration with David Guetta), as well as her judging role on series 8 of The X Factor (UK). The A.V. Club's Evan Rytlewski called Here I Am a declaration of Rowland's liberation. Rytlewski attributed the album's appeal to the producers, who he felt \"drove forward the sound\" and prevented Rowland from taking \"songs too seriously\" as done on Simply Deep. He concluded his review by also praising Rowland's choice to include elements of dance music. Elyssa Garnder from USA Today gave the album a mixed review, stating that \"Rowland traverses the gamut of predictable romantic scenarios prettily enough... alas, Here I Am proves a lot more cautious than that dare suggests.\" Jon Caramanica from The New York Times called the album both smart and surprising. \"Here I Am is something much more confident and more surprising [than expected]. It's a chewy and moody R&B album on which Ms. Rowland sounds assured and vital. Or, at minimum, is made to sound that way... Her vocals are stacked thick and placed loud in the mix, but while they're noticeable, they're not particularly notable apart from their arrangements.\"Despite finding some of its material unoriginal, Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe commented that \"Rowland makes up for her limited range with expressiveness throughout,\" while noting that the songs are centered around \"self-affirmation and confidence.\" He ended his review by stating that the album's closing track \"Down for Whatever\" had a \"pounding groove\" which should have been the sentiment for the rest of the album. Allison Stewart from The Washington Post commented that Here I Am would not establish a personality for Rowland, but it did not matter as she was in a place in her career where she did not need one. Described as a \"perfectly likeable club-centric R&B\" offering, Stewart said Rowland makes the most of the \"killer beats and a flat affect\" trends in the industry. Comments echoed by Michaelangelo Matos from the Los Angeles Times' whose scathing review criticised the \"bland material,\" particularly noting \"secondhand beats\" and awkward lyrics. Slant Magazine's Jesse Cataldo also called the album mediocre. Cataldo said \"the skimpy roster [of rappers] makes Here I Am sound distressingly bare, and depressingly short on surprises and diversion. Rowland makes up for this by pushing the sex angle, but this pose never seems entirely natural.\""

The song alternates between soft and hard-rocking sections and changes in tempo, with the lighter sections employing a tremolo effect on the guitar, or possibly by running it through a Leslie speaker, to give an 'underwater talking' feel. John Paul Jones plays a Hohner \"Electra-Piano\" electric piano on the track. \"Down by the Seaside\" was never performed live at Led Zeppelin concerts.Plant later recorded \"Down by the Seaside\" as a duet with Tori Amos for the 1995 Led Zeppelin tribute album Encomium."

        "content": "When the Latin Wikipedia began, the predominant topics were those having to do with classical history, but beginning in 2006, a group of new contributors greatly expanded the coverage of 20th-century topics, such as pop culture and technology.The official policy of Vicipaedia is that neologisms and user coinings are not allowed (\"Noli fingere!\" Latin for \"Don't coin/make up things\"). In order to deal with concepts that did not exist in Classical or Medieval Latin, terms from modern Latin sources are used, such as botanical Latin, scientific Latin, 18th- and 19th-century Latin language encyclopedias and books, the official Vatican dictionary of modern Latin, as well as current Latin newspapers and radio shows, such as Ephemeris and Radio Bremen.As in any language with a broad international character, often more than one correct term exists for a given concept (just as in English a certain car part is called a \"bonnet\" by British speakers but a \"hood\" by Americans). In Latin the existence of multiple synonyms is even more prevalent since the language has been in continuous use over a wide geographical area for over 2000 years. Sometimes the same concept is represented by different terms in classical, medieval, scientific and modern Latin. In general Vicipaedia adopts the oldest or classical term for the page name, with redirects from any others; major alternatives are listed in the article with footnote references. There is often lively debate among editors about shades of meaning. The practice of avoiding invented words and giving references for alternative terms agrees well with the general Wikipedia insistence on verifiability and the rule against original research.\nMany universities and other institutions have official Latin names. In fields where Latin is the current standard language, Vicipaedia normally adopts official names as pagenames, even if they belong to scientific or technical, rather than to classical Latin. This applies to:\n\nnames of Catholic dioceses\nCatholic official titles\nbiological species and other taxa\nplanets, asteroids, satellites, and constellations\ntopographical features on extraterrestrial bodies\nanatomical names\nnames of diseasesWhen occasionally a term for a modern concept cannot be found, the customary practice is to do exactly what most other languages do: to borrow an international word (often from a Romance language or English). Such direct borrowing was done for the particle names photon (Latin: photon), and gluon (Latin: gluon) and for the unit of temperature Kelvin (Latin: Kelvinus). The word is given a Latin morphology if this can be done easily, or, if not, used unchanged in its foreign form; but many international words already have a Latin or Graeco-Latin appearance, because Greek and Latin have always served as sources of new scientific terminology."

        "content": "Latin Wikipedia made it policy for all to follow the more widespread contemporary late 20th century orthographical habit of distinguishing u (pronounced as [u]) from v (pronounced as [w] in Classical Latin and as [v] in Ecclesiastical Latin) but not i (pronounced as [i]) from j (pronounced as [j] in both Classical and Ecclesiastical Latin). This orthographical practice was not without detractors, who claimed that it is a copy of the Italian spelling reform in which the i/j distinction is lost but the u/v distinction is maintained.The Latin Wikipedia logo reads \"VICIP\u00c6DIA\", displaying the \"\u00c6\". However, in accordance with contemporary practice, Vicipaedia does not use ligatures in its articles for the diphthongs written ae (\"\u00c6\", \"\u00e6\") and oe (\"\u0152\", \"\u0153\"), even though in Latin a diphthong like the ae in aes is pronounced differently from an hiatus like the ae in aer, both in the classical and even more so in the Italianate pronunciation. The ligatures were adopted by the Romans to save space, and \u00e6 and \u0153 in particular were later maintained by Latin typographers to distinguish the diphthong from the hiatus. Latin Wikipedia has chosen another convention, namely to write hiatus with the diaeresis: a\u00eb, o\u00eb. If Latin Wikipedia users prefer, however, they can activate a gadget under user preferences that automatically displays ae and oe without the diaeresis as ligatures on the pages.\nLatin Wikipedia, in common with the majority of modern printed Latin, does not require the marking of long vowels in words (in Latin textbooks this is usually done by adding a macron over a character, as for example, the e in st\u0113lla.) Thus, both terra and terr\u0101 are written simply as terra, although the former is in the nominative case, while the latter in the ablative. The context usually makes clear which one is being used, though the use of macron or apex is allowed when the distinction is necessary."

By those, who are touched with the intelligence of Western journalists and experts, their professionalism and analytical capabilities. By those, who understand a deal of the free media, democracy and Russian bears that they love so much ... The activity of InoSMI led yet to the one sensible result \u2014 foreign media now can be considered actually worldwide. They are not only being avidly read, but also loved in Russia. Without that \"avid\" love of the Russian people the audience of the foreign media would be incomplete and their influence won't be worldwide.\nAttitude of the foreign press to Russia changed in the 21st century and became more critical. For example, British media became less sober, but more uniform. Their American colleagues, who are a sort of a reference of the free and democratic media for the world perform today perhaps the most difficult and critical towards Russia mission. They do everything possible to return it to the path of democracy, and even more to that, their status doesn't only oblige but even dictate them to do that. Criticism in this case plays the role of the major weapon of the democracy, the aggressivity and positivitiness of which often resemble well the dictatorship.\nThe forum is the soul of the site, which speaks about the site perhaps even more than its face (contents) sais. Its existence evidences that the editorial board is fearless, trusts its readers and isn't afraid that that face would be lost or overthrown under the surge of their \"collective mind\" ... The text without readers comments is incomplete and bears little information. Indeed, if InoSMI did not have a forum, how could one not to feel despair looking at all what's get published here? It's the first, the greatest and the most influential world forum at a site of foreign press translations. As the mirror of the mirror InoSMI, it is wholly and entirely (but not ultimately) born by Western media and is their fortune, owing to which the latter become more close to and understandable by our reader."

Individuals within RT\u00c9, including the organisation's Director-General Joe Barry, were interested in staging the event outside of Dublin for the first time, and alongside Dublin RT\u00c9 production teams scouted locations in rural Ireland in the months following Ireland's win. Although the contest had previously been held in smaller towns, such as Harrogate, an English town of 70,000 people which staged the 1982 contest, with a population of 1,500 Millstreet became the smallest settlement to stage the event at that time and continues to hold the record as of 2023. The arena would have an audience of around 3,500 during the contest. The choice of Millstreet and the Green Glens Arena to stage the contest was met with some ridicule, with BBC journalist Nicholas Witchell referring to the venue as a \"cowshed\", however Millstreet had won out over more conventional locations, including Dublin and Galway, due to the facilities available in the Green Glens Arena and the town's local community which were hugely enthusiastic about the event being staged in their area.Due to the small size of Millstreet, delegations were primarily based in surrounding settlements, including Killarney and other towns in counties Cork and Kerry. Alongside Millstreet itself, Killarney and Cork City held receptions for the competing delegates during the week of the contest, at the Great Southern Hotel in Killarney and Cork's City Hall, the latter hosted by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht."

This came as a result of revolutions among many European countries that led to the fall of communist regimes and the formation of liberal democratic government among existing states and newly sovereign countries formed from entities within the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. In an effort to incorporate these new countries into the contest, the contest organisers the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) raised the maximum number of participating countries to twenty-five \u2013 the highest number yet seen in the contest \u2013 creating space for three new countries to participate alongside twenty-two of the twenty-three countries that had participated in the 1992 contest. Yugoslavia \u2013 which had participated in the contest since 1961 \u2013 was unable to participate as its EBU member broadcaster Jugoslovenska radio-televizija (JRT) was disbanded in 1992 and its successor organisations Radio-televizija Srbije (RTS) and Radio-televizija Crne Gore (RTCG) were barred from joining the EBU due to sanctions against the country as part of the Yugoslav Wars.As a temporary solution for the 1993 contest, a qualifying round was organised to determine the three countries which would join the contest for the first time. Subsequently, for the 1994 contest, a relegation system was introduced which would bar the lowest-scoring countries from participating in the following year's event. At the running order draw, held in December 1992 at the National Concert Hall in Dublin and hosted by Pat Kenny and Linda Martin, the three new countries were represented as Countries A, B and C, corresponding with the countries that placed first, second and third in the qualifying competition respectively. Entitled Kvalifikacija za Millstreet, the qualifying round took place on 3 April 1993 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Initially broadcasters in as many as fourteen countries registered an interest in competing in the event, however only seven countries eventually submitted entries, representing Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Ultimately the entries from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia were chosen to progress to the contest proper in Millstreet; as constituent republics of SFR Yugoslavia, representatives from all three countries had previously competed in the contest.A number of artists who had previously participated in the contest were featured among the performers at this event, either as the main performing artist or as backing performers: Tony Wegas represented Austria for a second consecutive year, and among his backing performers was Gary Lux, who had previously represented Austria in the contest on three occasions, as a member of the group Westend in 1983 and as a solo artist in 1985 and 1987; Katri Helena made a second contest appearance for Finland, having previously competed in 1979; and Denmark's Tommy Seebach, having previously competed in 1979 as a solo artist and in 1981 alongside Debbie Cameron, competed in the 1993 contest as part of the Seebach Band."

A separate musical director could be nominated by each country to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director also available to conduct for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor.Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration and performed in the language, or one of the languages, of the country which it represented. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country's performance, and all participants were required to have reached the age of 16 in the year of the contest. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks; however any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers.The results of the 1993 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in 1975: each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country's top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. The points awarded by each country were determined by an assembled jury of sixteen individuals, which was required to be split evenly between members of the public and music professionals, between men and women, and by age. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country's performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing.The 1993 contest was at the time the largest outside broadcast production ever undertaken by RT\u00c9, and the broadcaster was reported to have spent over \u00a32,200,000 on producing the event. In order to stage the event Millstreet and the Green Glens Arena underwent major infrastructure improvements, which were led by local groups and individuals. The floor area within the arena had to be dug out in order to create additional height to facilitate the stage and equipment, extra phone lines had to be installed, and the town's railway line and station required an extension at an extra cost of over \u00a31,000,000.The stage design for the Millstreet contest featured the largest stage yet constructed for the event, covering 2,500ft\u00b2 (232m\u00b2) of translucent material which was illuminated from below by lighting strips. A mirror image of the triangular shaped stage was suspended from above, and a slanted background created a distorted perspective for the viewer. A hidden doorway featured in the centre of the stage, which was used by the presenter at the beginning of the show, and by the winning artist as they re-entered the arena following the broadcast. The contest logo, which was publicly presented in February 1993, was designed by Conor Cassidy and was adapted from aspects of the coat of arms of County Cork.Rehearsals for the participating artists began on 10 May 1993. Two technical rehearsals were conducted for each participating delegation in the week approaching the contest, with countries rehearsing in the order in which they would perform. The first rehearsals were held on 10 and 11 May, consisting of a 15-minute stage-call for the setting up of the stage with instruments and equipment and to brief the orchestra, followed by a 25-minute rehearsal, with the second rehearsals held on 12 and 13 May comprising a 10-minute stage call and 20-minute rehearsal. Following each first rehearsal, there was an opportunity for delegates to review their rehearsals on video monitors, as well as to take part in a 25-minute press conference. Three dress rehearsals were held with all artists, two held in the afternoon and evening of 14 May and one final rehearsal in the afternoon of 15 May. An audience was present for the second dress rehearsal on the evening of 12 May, which was highly attended by the local population of Millstreet."

The show was presented by the Irish journalist Fionnuala Sweeney.The contest was opened by an animated sequence designed by Gary Keenan and inspired by Celtic mythology, set to Irish traditional music by composers Ronan Johnston and Shea Fitzgerald and featuring uilleann pipes player Davy Spillane. The interval act comprised performances by previous Eurovision winners Linda Martin, reprising her winning song from the previous year's contest \"Why Me?\", and Johnny Logan, performing the song \"Voices (Are Calling)\" with choirs from the Cork School of Music and local children of Millstreet. The trophy awarded to the winners was crafted by Waterford Crystal and was presented by Linda Martin.The winner was Ireland represented by the song \"In Your Eyes\", written by Jimmy Walsh and performed by Niamh Kavanagh. This marked Ireland's fifth contest win, putting them level with Luxembourg and France for the country with the most wins, and its second win in a row, matching the same feat previously achieved by Spain (1968 and 1969), Luxembourg (1972 and 1973) and Israel (1978 and 1979). The United Kingdom finished in second place for the second year in a row, and for a record-extending fourteenth time overall."

Released as a double album on 24 February 1975 in the United States and on 28 February 1975 in the United Kingdom, it was the group's first album to be released under their new label, Swan Song Records. The band wrote and recorded eight new songs for the album in early 1974 at Headley Grange, a country house in Hampshire, which gave them ample time to improvise arrangements and experiment with recording. The total playing time covered just under three sides of an LP, so they decided to expand it into a double album by including previously unreleased tracks from the sessions for the band's earlier albums Led Zeppelin III (1970), Led Zeppelin IV (1971) and Houses of the Holy (1973). The album covered a range of styles including hard rock, progressive rock, rock 'n' roll and folk. The album was then mixed over summer 1974 and planned for an end-of-year release; however, its release was delayed because the Peter Corriston-designed die-cut album cover proved difficult to manufacture.\nPhysical Graffiti was commercially and critically successful upon its release and debuted at number one on album charts in the UK and number three in the US. It was promoted by a successful US tour and a five-night residency at Earl's Court, London. The album has been reissued on CD several times, including an expansive 40th anniversary edition in 2015. Physical Graffiti was later certified 16\u00d7 platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2006, signifying shipments of over eight million copies in the US."

        "content": "The first attempt by Led Zeppelin to record songs for Physical Graffiti took place in November 1973 at Headley Grange in Hampshire, England, where they had previously recorded their untitled fourth album. The recording equipment consisted of Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio. Guitarist and producer Jimmy Page and drummer John Bonham recorded an instrumental which was later reworked as \"Kashmir\" during this visit. However, these sessions came to a halt quickly and the studio time was turned over to Bad Company, who used it to record songs for their debut album. The press reported that bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones was ill and unable to record. However, he had become disillusioned with the group and fed up with touring, and told manager Peter Grant he was considering quitting. Grant asked him to reconsider and to take the rest of the year off to recuperate.The group reconvened at Headley Grange in January and February 1974, where they recorded eight tracks engineered by Ron Nevison. Lead singer Robert Plant later referred to these eight tracks as \"the belters\", including \"off-the-wall stuff that turned out really nice\". As with previous sessions at Headley Grange, the informal atmosphere allowed the group to improvise and develop material while recording. Sometimes the group would rehearse or record a track several times, discuss what went wrong or what could be improved and then realised they had worked out an alternative arrangement for it which was better. Bonham was a driving force at the sessions, regularly suggesting ideas or the best ways in which a complicated arrangement could be played successfully. This led to him getting a lead songwriting credit on several tracks.The eight songs extended beyond the length of a conventional album, almost spanning three sides of an LP, so the group decided to create a double album, adding material they had recorded for previous albums but never issued. This included various jam sessions such as \"Boogie With Stu\", which Page thought would be unsuitable as a track on a single album. Additional overdubs were laid down, and the final mixing of the album was performed in July 1974 by Keith Harwood at Olympic Studios, London. The title \"Physical Graffiti\" was coined by Page to illustrate the whole physical and written energy that had gone into producing the set."

        "content": "The album was originally released with a die-cut sleeve design depicting a New York City tenement block, through whose windows various cultural icons could be interchangeably viewed. The album designer, Peter Corriston, was looking for a building that was symmetrical with interesting details, that was not obstructed by other objects and would fit the square album cover. He subsequently came up with the rest of the cover based on the idea of people moving in and out of the tenement, with various sleeves that could be placed under the main cover and filling the windows with various pieces of information.The two five-storey buildings photographed for the album cover are located at 96 and 98 St. Mark's Place in New York City. The original photograph underwent a number of tweaks to arrive at the final image. The fourth floor of the building had to be cropped out to fit the square album cover format. (The front doorway and stoop at 96 St. Mark's Place is also the location used by the Rolling Stones for the music video promoting their single \"Waiting on a Friend\", from their 1981 album Tattoo You).\nEschewing the usual gatefold design in favour of a special die-cut cover, the original album jacket included four covers made up of two inners (for each disc), a middle insert cover and an outer cover. The middle insert cover is white and details all the album track listings and recording information. The outer cover has die-cut windows on the building, so when the middle cover is wrapped around the inner covers and slid into the outer cover, the title of the album is shown on the front cover, spelling out the name \"Physical Graffiti\". Images in the windows touched upon a set of American icons and a range of Hollywood ephemera. Pictures of W. C. Fields and Buzz Aldrin alternated with the snapshots of Led Zeppelin. Photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald, Marcel Duchamp and Pope Leo XIII are also featured. Per the liner notes, package concept and design was by AGI/Mike Doud (London) and Peter Corriston (New York). Photography was by Elliott Erwitt, B. P. Fallon, and Roy Harper. \"Tinting Extraordinaire\": Maurice Tate, and window illustration by Dave Heffernan. In 1976, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of best album package."

Until this point, all of Led Zeppelin's albums had been released on Atlantic Records, who would distribute Swan Song. The album was first announced to the press on 6 November with a planned release date of 29 November and an accompanying US tour (the band's tenth) starting in January. Delays in the production of the album's sleeve design prevented its release prior to the commencement of the tour. It was finally released on 24 February 1975.\n\nThe album was a commercial and critical success, having built up a huge advance order following the delayed release date, and when eventually issued it reached No. 1 in the UK charts. In the US, it debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, rising to No. 1 the following week and staying there for six weeks.  Physical Graffiti has since proven to be one of the most popular releases by the group, shipping 8 million copies in the United States. It was the first album to go platinum on advance orders alone. Shortly after its release, all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart.The group debuted several songs from Physical Graffiti live at a warm-up gig in Rotterdam, Netherlands, on 11 January, a week before the US tour, which lasted until 27 March. The tour was also successful, and was followed up by a series of shows at Earl's Court, London. Tickets for the shows sold out within four hours, described by promoter Mel Bush as \"unprecedented demand in the history of rock music\", so a further two dates were added. The shows attracted rave reviews, and critics noted the band enjoyed playing the new material on Physical Graffiti more than the older songs.NME's Nick Kent reviewed the album three months before it was released. He speculated it could be the group's best work to date, saying \"the album's tonal density is absolutely the toughest, most downright brutal I've heard all year\". In March 1975, Billboard magazine's reviewer wrote: \"[Physical Graffiti] is a tour de force through a number of musical styles, from straight rock to blues to folky acoustic to orchestral sounds.\" Similarly, Jim Miller stated in Rolling Stone that the double album was \"the band's Tommy, Beggar's Banquet and Sgt. Pepper rolled into one: Physical Graffiti is Led Zeppelin's bid for artistic respectability\". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau maintained his long-held ambivalence regarding Led Zeppelin, writing that except for side two, the material often wanders into \"wide tracks, misconceived opi, and so forth\", and \"after a while Robert Plant begins to grate\".In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it at number 70 on the magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". It was re-ranked at number 73 in a 2012 revised list, and re-ranked at number 144 in 2020.Plant later felt that Physical Graffiti represented the band at its creative peak, and has since said that it is his favourite Led Zeppelin album. Page has also said the album was a \"high-water mark\" for the group, and the creative energy from jamming and gradually working out song structures together led to some strong material. Reviewing the album for BBC Music in 2007, Chris Jones described it as \"a towering monument to the glory of Zeppelin in their high-flying heyday\".\n(*) designates unordered lists."

He booked a week in May 1990 with engineer George Marino to remaster the entire back catalogue.  Eight tracks from Physical Graffiti appeared on the four-disc Boxed Set and three on Remasters, both in 1990; the remainder appeared on Boxed Set 2 in 1993, while the album was properly reissued in 1994.An extended remastered version of Physical Graffiti was reissued on 23 February 2015, almost exactly forty years after the original album was released.

Published only six times from 1947 to 1949, it struggled in its early years. By 1952, regular contributor and editor John R. Bond and his wife Elaine had become the owners of the magazine, which then grew until its sale to CBS Publications in 1972.The ampersand (&) in the title was introduced in 1955 by then Editor Terry Galanoy, who replaced the word \"and\" in the magazine's name because the words Road and Track were graphically too long for newsstand-effective recognition.\nIn 1988, Hachette Filipacchi Media took ownership of the magazine. In October 2008, Matt DeLorenzo became editor-in-chief, succeeding Thos L. Bryant, who had been in place for 20 years. Hearst Magazines purchased the magazine in 2011. In June 2012, Larry Webster assumed the role of editor-in-chief, and DeLorenzo became an adviser to the publication. Additionally, the magazine moved its operations from Newport Beach, California, to Ann Arbor, Michigan.In February 2016, Webster resigned as editor-in-chief and Kim Wolfkill was announced as his replacement. In the March/April 2019 issue, Wolfkill announced that the editorial offices in Michigan were closing, and that publication was moving to New York, New York, at the Hearst Tower. His LinkedIn profile lists February 2019 as his final date at Road & Track. Travis Okulski, Road & Track's website director at the time, took on the editor-in-chief role from the May 2019 issue onwards.Car and Driver and Road & Track are sister publications at Hearst and share the same advertising, sales, marketing, and circulation departments. However, their editorial operations are distinct and they have separate publishers.\nIn August 2020, the magazine transitioned to a large-format bi-monthly that emphasized elegant design and deeply-reported features. Incoming Editor-in-Chief Mike Guy, who had previously launched The Drive for Time Inc., hired Executive Editor Daniel Pund and Creative Director Nathan Schroeder, and together they refashioned Road & Track as the premium, 180-page enthusiast magazine on stands today. The Smoking Tire's Matt Farah and best-selling author A.J.

        "content": "Norton is a surname with origin from the basic Early English nor\u00fe + tun, meaning North settlement (cf Weston, Sutton and Easton for other surnames derived from points of the compass). There are many English villages called Norton or including Norton as part of the name, e.g. Midsomer Norton, Chipping Norton, Brize Norton etc. When surnames started to be used in the Middle Ages, a man from such a village might have the name added e.g. Tom of Norton. Alternatively a man from the north side of any village might be given the name Tom Norton to distinguish him from a Tom from the south side (Tom Sutton). A secondary source for the surname is from the anglicisation of Celtic (Irish and Scottish Gaelic) surnames (e.g. Naughtan). It is also sometimes found as a Jewish surname (probably from the anglicisation of the German surname Norden). The famous Emperor Norton in San Francisco was of Jewish origin from a South African settler family."

The brush is native to Scotland and England, but it is more commonly found in Scotland due to its rocky territories. The name is derived from Middle English hather.Heather has several other definitions. The most commonly known is as a reference to a color mixture; it is most often a pale shade of blue from blue itself to pink to even purple mixed with gray. However, many times it refers to any color that includes gray or gray streaks within it, such as what is known as heather fabric.\nThe masculine form of the name is Heath."

        "content": "Newspapers.com records the use of \"Miss Heather\" in reference to a girl's name as early as 2 August 1852, in The New York Times. An infant by the name of Miss Heather Campbell arrived on a ship from Glasgow in New York, with her mother.The American Social Security Administration's records show it to already be in use in 1935, though it was rare at the time coming in at #997, barely making the top 1000 names of that era. The name is currently popular among the people of Generations X and Generation Y. The name itself peaked in popularity at #3, in 1975.Heather, though a name found primarily in English speaking countries, has other variants simply because of its definition as a flowering plant. However its foreign names often closely resemble other words with meanings so is difficult to distinguish a given variant's origin as arising from the flower, or from that of another word. For example, the name Heidi in German resembles Heidekraut, which is the German word for the Heather shrubs, though the name Heidi is usually thought to mean \"of noble birth\" (a diminutive of the name Adelheid).  The 1988 dark comedy film, Heathers, satirized the name by associating it with \"in-crowd\" cliques of teen-age high school girls.\nThe name Erica actually has two meanings, one of which is related to the Heather plant whose Latin name is Ericaceae. Its other meaning of \"ruler\" is similar to that of the German meaning of Heidi. This leaves the impression that the shrub name and the meaning of \"a noble\" or \"ruler\" are similar, or it is a large coincidence."

Stranded is an eloquent statement that there are still frontiers which American pop has not explored.\"Reviewing for Creem in 1974, Robert Christgau found Ferry to be an \"ambitious\" but \"oblique\" artist and quoted New York artist Sidney Tillem's 1969 thesis on figurative art, \"Aspects and Prospects\", to conclude his review of the album: \"By moral in the context of art I mean a style which executes the deeper social and psychological function of form, as opposed to a particular aspect of vanity called taste. Pop sensibility, pop consciousness, pop sentimentality have been invaluable in clarifying the provincialism and nostalgia that actually permeate a culture that has come to pride itself on sophistication. But they have not resulted in a new art simply because the requisite idealism has been lacking.\"In a positive retrospective review, AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote of the album: \"Under the direction of Bryan Ferry, Roxy moved toward[s] relatively straightforward territory, adding greater layers of piano and heavy guitars. Even without the washes of Eno's synthesizers, Roxy's music remains unsettling on occasion, yet in this new incarnation, they favor more measured material.\"Although it was the first Roxy Music album made without Brian Eno, Eno later described it as one of his personal favourite albums by the group."

With few exceptions, West wrote the lyrics by himself and the music was predominantly Burgess's, though West took on a larger role in writing the music as time went on. West's songwriting credits appear under his real name, Keith Hopkins; this was a concession to his family, who in his words \"didn't feel it was really me unless they saw it in black and white.\"The lyrics to \"Three Jolly Little Dwarves\" were written by West while experimenting with LSD.During the album sessions Tomorrow recorded two completely different songs with the same title, \"Now Your Time Has Come\", only one of which appeared on the album. Wirtz and the band members were both at a loss to explain how the songs came to share a title. The \"Now Your Time Has Come\" which was excluded from the album appeared as a bonus track on the 1999 CD issue."

        "content": "The Man Who Sold the World is the third studio album by the English musician David Bowie, originally released through Mercury Records in the United States on 4 November 1970 and in the United Kingdom on 10 April 1971. Produced by Tony Visconti and recorded in London from April to May 1970, the album features the first appearances on a Bowie record of future Spiders from Mars members Mick Ronson and Mick Woodmansey.\nFollowing the largely acoustic and folk rock sound of David Bowie (1969), The Man Who Sold the World marked a shift toward hard rock, with elements of blues rock. The lyrics are darker than his previous releases, exploring themes of insanity, religion, technology and war. None of its songs were released as singles; some tracks appeared as B-sides between 1970 and 1973. Originally titled Metrobolist, a play on the film Metropolis (1927), the title was changed at the last minute by Mercury without Bowie's consultation.\nThe album was released with different cover artwork in the US and the UK. For the US release, the artwork was a cartoon-like drawing by Michael J. Weller of a cowboy in front of an asylum. The UK cover by Keith MacMillan features Bowie wearing a Michael Fish-designed blue dress. A 1972 reissue by RCA Records featured a black-and-white picture of Bowie's then-current character Ziggy Stardust; reissues since 1990 have revived the original UK artwork.\nThe Man Who Sold the World was originally better received by music critics in the US than in the UK. Nevertheless, it was a commercial failure in both countries; the 1972 reissue managed to chart in both the US and the UK. Retrospectively, the album has been praised by critics for the band's performance and the unsettling nature of its music and lyrics, being considered by many to be the start of Bowie's \"classic period\". It has since been reissued multiple times and was remixed in 2020, under its original title Metrobolist, for its 50th anniversary."

        "content": "David Bowie's breakthrough single \"Space Oddity\" was released in July 1969, bringing him commercial success and attention. However, its parent album, David Bowie (Space Oddity), released later that year, was not as successful, partly due to the failure of Philips Records to promote the album efficiently. By 1970, the attention Bowie had garnered from \"Space Oddity\" had dissipated and his follow-up single, \"The Prettiest Star\", failed to chart. Realising that his potential as a solo artist was dwindling, Bowie decided to form a band with bassist Tony Visconti, who previously worked with Bowie on Space Oddity, and drummer John Cambridge. Calling themselves Hype, the group still needed a guitarist.On 2 February 1970, Bowie met guitarist Mick Ronson following a performance at the Marquee Club in London. The two connected immediately and agreed to work together. Following their meeting, Ronson joined Hype. For the group's performances, the members wore flamboyant superhero-like costumes. Bowie halted Hype performances at the end of March 1970 so he could focus on recording and songwriting, as well as resolve managing disputes with his manager Kenneth Pitt. The new single version of the Space Oddity track \"Memory of a Free Festival\" and an early attempt at \"The Supermen\" were recorded during this time.Cambridge was dismissed from Hype at the end of March, with a new drummer, Mick \"Woody\" Woodmansey, joining the group at the suggestion of Ronson. According to biographer Kevin Cann, Cambridge was dismissed by Bowie, but according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, Visconti recalled that the dismissal was Ronson's request. On his first impression of Bowie, Woodmansey said in 2015: \"This guy was living and breathing being a rock & roll star.\" By April 1970, the four members of Hype were living in Haddon Hall, Beckenham, an Edwardian mansion converted to a block of flats that was described by one visitor as having an ambiance \"like Dracula's living room\". Ronson and Visconti built a makeshift studio under the grand staircase at Haddon Hall; Bowie recorded many of his early 1970s demos there."

        "content": "Recording for The Man Who Sold the World began on 17 April 1970 at Advision Studios in London, with the group beginning work on \"All the Madmen\". The next day, Ralph Mace was hired to play the Moog synthesiser, borrowed from George Harrison, following his work on the single version of \"Memory of a Free Festival\". At the time, Mace was a 40-year-old concert pianist who was also head of the classical music department at Mercury Records. During this time, Bowie terminated his contract with Pitt and met his future manager Tony Defries, who assisted Bowie in the termination. Recording moved to Trident Studios in London on 21 April and continued there for the rest of April until mid-May. On 4 May, the band recorded \"Running Gun Blues\" and \"Saviour Machine\", the latter of which was originally the working title for the title track, before Bowie reworked the song into a different melody to form the final version of \"Saviour Machine\". Recording and mixing was moved back to Advision on 12 May and completed ten days later. Bowie recorded his vocal for the title track on the final day.As Bowie was preoccupied with his new wife Angie at the time, as well as his managerial issues, the music was largely arranged by Ronson and Visconti. Ronson used the sessions to learn about many production and arrangement techniques from Visconti. Although Bowie is officially credited as the composer of all music on The Man Who Sold the World, author Peter Doggett quoted Visconti as saying that \"the songs were written by all four of us. We'd jam in a basement, and Bowie would just say whether he liked them or not.\" In Doggett's narrative, \"The band (sometimes with Bowie contributing guitar, sometimes not) would record an instrumental track, which might or might not be based upon an original Bowie idea. Then, at the last possible moment, Bowie would reluctantly uncurl himself from the sofa on which he was lounging with his wife, and dash off a set of lyrics.\" Conversely, Bowie was quoted in a 1998 interview as saying, \"I really did object to the impression that I did not write the songs on The Man Who Sold the World. You only have to check out the chord changes. No-one writes chord changes like that.\" \"The Width of a Circle\" and \"The Supermen\", for example, were already in existence before the sessions began."

        "content": "The Man Who Sold the World was a departure from the largely acoustic and folk rock sound of Space Oddity. According to music critic Greg Kot, it marked Bowie's change of direction into hard rock. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as \"almost all hard blues rock or psychedelic folk rock\", while Doggett writes that it is \"filled with propulsive hard rock\". Much of the material has a distinct heavy metal edge that distinguishes it from Bowie's other releases, and has been compared to contemporary acts such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. According to Marc Spitz, Ronson was intent on making a heavy blues album \"worthy of Cream.\"Like the music, the lyrics are significantly darker than its predecessor. According to Doggett, they contain numerous themes that Bowie would continue to explore throughout the rest of the 1970s decade, including \"madness, alienation, violence, confusion of identity, power, darkness and sexual possession\". The lyrics have also been seen as reflecting the influence of such figures as Aleister Crowley, Franz Kafka and Friedrich Nietzsche. Since Bowie wrote most of the lyrics at the last minute, O'Leary writes that The Man Who Sold the World is a more \"coherent\" concept album than his fifth and eighth albums, Ziggy Stardust (1972) and Diamond Dogs (1974), respectively. He continues, saying that the songs \"mirror and answer each other\", sharing similar themes and imagery."

        "content": "The original 1970 US release of The Man Who Sold the World employed a cartoon-like cover drawing by Bowie's friend Michael J. Weller, featuring a cowboy in front of Cane Hill asylum. Weller, whose friend was a patient there, suggested the idea after Bowie had asked him to create a design that would capture the music's foreboding tone. Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, Weller used a photograph of actor John Wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten-gallon hat and holding a rifle, which was meant to be an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to include the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"\u2014a pun on record players, guns, and drug use\u2014but Mercury found the idea too risqu\u00e9 and the balloon was left blank. According to Pegg, \"at this point, [Bowie's] intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis; the title remained on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man Who Sold the World\".Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance. The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish. It has been said that Bowie's \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo were inspired by a Pre-Raphaelite painting by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. In the United States, Mercury rejected MacMillan's photo and released the album with Weller's design as its cover, much to the displeasure of Bowie, although he successfully lobbied the record label to use the photo for the release in the United Kingdom. In 1972, he said Weller's design was \"horrible\" but reappraised it in 1999, saying he \"actually thought the cartoon cover was really cool\".While promoting The Man Who Sold the World in the US, Bowie wore the Fish dress in February 1971 on his first promotional tour and during interviews, despite the fact that the Americans had no knowledge of the then-unreleased UK cover. The 1971 German release's artwork presented a winged hybrid creature with Bowie's head and a hand for a body, preparing to flick the Earth away. The 1972 worldwide reissue by RCA Records used a black-and-white picture of Ziggy Stardust on the sleeve. The image remained the cover art on reissues until 1990 when the Rykodisc release reinstated the UK \"dress\" cover.  The \"dress\" cover has appeared on subsequent reissues of the album.In 2011, when the Victoria and Albert Museum in London was putting together the list of Bowie artifacts for the David Bowie Is show, the curators asked for the dress to display, but found that the dress had gone missing from Bowie's collection."

It was subsequently released in the UK on 10 April 1971 by Mercury, with the catalogue number 6338 041. Bowie was initially aggravated that Mercury had retitled the album from his preferred title of Metrobolist without his consultation, but following its release in the US, Bowie attempted to persuade the label to retitle the album Holy Holy after his newly released single of the same name. Following the commercial flop of \"Holy Holy\", the title remained The Man Who Sold the World for the UK release. According to Cann, the album was disliked by Mercury executives. However, it was played on US radio stations frequently and the \"heavy rock content\" increased interest in Bowie. Cann also writes that The Man Who Sold the World developed an underground following and laid \"solid foundations\" for Ziggy Stardust.None of the songs from the album were released as singles at the time, although a promo version of \"All the Madmen\" was issued in the US in 1970. Mercury released \"All the Madmen\" as a single, with Space Oddity's \"Janine\" on the B-side, but withdrew it. The same song appeared in Eastern Europe during 1973, as did \"The Width of a Circle\". \"Black Country Rock\" was released as the B-side of \"Holy Holy\" in the UK in January 1971, shortly before the release of The Man Who Sold the World. The title track appeared as the B-side of both the US single release of \"Space Oddity\" in 1972 and the UK release of \"Life on Mars?\" in 1973."

Music publications Melody Maker and NME originally found The Man Who Sold the World \"surprisingly excellent\" and \"rather hysterical\", respectively. Reviewing for Rolling Stone in February 1971, John Mendelsohn called the album \"uniformly excellent\" and commented that Visconti's \"use of echo, phasing, and other techniques on Bowie's voice ... serves to reinforce the jaggedness of Bowie's words and music\", which he interpreted as \"oblique and fragmented images that are almost impenetrable separately but which convey with effectiveness an ironic and bitter sense of the world when considered together\".Colman Andrews of Phonograph Record felt that record was a mixed bag, finding the lyrics both good and bad and Bowie's voice to be undistinguishable from other British artists, but enjoyed his vocal performance. Overall, Andrews stated, \"[The Man Who Sold the World] TRIES to define some new province of modern music, even if it's not completely successful. For that alone it deserves some attention.\" The Village Voice critic Robert Christgau considered the album and its predecessor to be \"overwrought excursions\". Mike Saunders from Who Put the Bomp magazine included The Man Who Sold the World in his ballot of 1971's top 10 albums for the first annual Pazz & Jop poll of American critics, published in The Village Voice in February 1972."

        "content": "After the completion of The Man Who Sold the World, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. His contract with music publisher Essex had expired and Defries, his new manager, was facing prior contractual challenges. In August 1970, Visconti parted ways with Bowie owing to his dislike of Defries and his frustration with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the making of The Man Who Sold the World; it was the last time he would see the artist for three or four years. Ronson and Woodmansey also departed due to other personal conflicts with Bowie. Despite his annoyance with Bowie during the sessions, Visconti still rated The Man Who Sold the World as his best work with him until his fourteenth studio album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980).Although his new single \"Holy Holy\", recorded in November 1970 and released in January 1971, was a commercial flop, the single earned Bowie a contract with music publisher Chrysalis. The critical success of the album in the US prompted Mercury to send Bowie on a promotional radio tour of the country in February 1971. Upon his return, he wrote the majority of the material that would appear on the follow-up albums Hunky Dory (1971) and Ziggy Stardust. Bowie also convened with Ronson and Woodmansey, who returned to play on both records. Following the commercial disappointment of Hunky Dory, Bowie finally found commercial success with Ziggy Stardust in 1972. Ronson and Woodmansey, along with bassist Trevor Bolder, would become famous as the Spiders from Mars."

        "content": "The Man Who Sold the World has been retrospectively described by Bowie's biographers and commentators as the beginning of Bowie's artistic growth, many considering it the first album where he began to find his sound. Buckley has described it as \"the first Bowie album proper\", and NME critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray stated, \"this is where the story really starts\". Erlewine cited The Man Who Sold the World as the beginning of Bowie's \"classic period\". Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club called the album his \"career blueprint\", writing that it was musically a forerunner to the \"swaggering electric disorientation\" of Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane (1973), but its greater importance on sequencing and atmosphere, as well as stronger songwriting, predated Hunky Dory. Paul Trynka calls The Man Who Sold the World Bowie's \"first truly gripping work\". Pegg finds it one of the best and most important albums in the history of rock music. In a 2013 readers' poll for Rolling Stone, it was voted Bowie's tenth greatest album.The album has been praised for the band's performance and the unsettling nature of its music and lyrics. In a review for AllMusic, Erlewine complimented its \"tight, twisted heavy guitar rock that appears simple on the surface but sounds more gnarled upon each listen\". He viewed its music and Bowie's \"paranoid futuristic tales\" as \"bizarre\", adding that: \"Musically, there isn't much time for innovation ...but there's an unsettling edge to the band's performance, which makes the record one of Bowie's best albums.\" In a review upon the album's reissue, a writer for Q called it \"a robust, sexually charged affair\", while a Mojo columnist wrote, \"A robust set that spins with dizzying disorientation ... Bowie's armoury was being hastily assembled, though it was never deployed with such thrilling abandon again.\" Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork called the album the \"dark horse\" of Bowie's catalogue. Comparing The Man Who Sold the World to its predecessor, he praised the arrangements as tougher and \"more effective\", and complimented his artistic growth.The album has since been cited as inspiring the goth rock, dark wave and science fiction elements of work by artists such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Cure, Gary Numan, John Foxx and Nine Inch Nails. It has been claimed that glam rock began with the release of The Man Who Sold the World, though this is also attributed to Bolan's appearance on the UK television programme Top of the Pops in March 1971 wearing glitter. In his journal, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana listed it at number 45 on his top 50 favourite albums list. The title track provided an unlikely hit for Scottish pop singer Lulu, which was produced by Bowie and Ronson, and would be covered by many artists over the years, including Richard Barone in 1987, and Nirvana in 1993 for their live album MTV Unplugged in New York."

The only traditional song on the album, \"A Sailor's Life\", is seen as pivotal in the development of English folk rock music.\nChanges in the line-up of the band, due not only to its musical direction but also to external events, mark this album as a turning point in the band's history. 1969 was a prolific year for Fairport Convention; from What We Did on Our Holidays to Liege & Lief within twelve months represented a major development.\nThe album also gave the band their first UK chart success, reaching number 12 in the UK album chart (the second highest position in the band's entire career), while the single release, \"Si Tu Dois Partir\", achieved number 21 in the UK singles chart."

        "content": "Fairport Convention had been invited to Bob Dylan's London music publishers to hear then-unreleased tracks from The Basement Tapes sessions. The band's bassist, Ashley Hutchings, said \"We loved it all. We would have covered all the songs if we could.\" In the event, versions of \"Percy's Song\", \"Million Dollar Bash\" and \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\" (retitled \"Si Tu Dois Partir\") were used on the album. The French lyrics for the latter were created during the interval of a performance at the Middle Earth Club. According to guitarist Simon Nicol: \"I think the boredom factor was one of the reasons we came up with this wacky idea. Three or four punters joined us in the dressing room; they were either French visitors or students of French working in London, and happened to be there that night.\" \"Percy's Song\" and \"Million Dollar Bash\" had never been released before.\n\nThe band's male vocalist Iain Matthews left during the recordings for Unhalfbricking to make his own album Matthews' Southern Comfort, after recording just one track, \"Percy's Song\". Sandy Denny sang lead vocals on all the other songs, including her own compositions, \"Autopsy\", and \"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\". The latter was covered by many artists and is now viewed to be a classic. The lengthy \"A Sailor's Life\", a traditional English folk song collected by A. L. Lloyd, was already part of Denny's club repertoire. In particular, the version on Unhalfbricking has been described as \"the turning point of Fairport's history from earlier contemporary Americana to English songs\" and by AllMusic's Richie Unterberger as a \"clear signpost to the future\".Guitarist Richard Thompson contributed two compositions to the album. The opening track, \"Genesis Hall\", is a slow 3/4 waltz, on which Simon Nicol played dulcimer, while Sandy Denny provided the vocals; it was the B-Side of the single release. Genesis Hall was the nickname of the former Bell Hotel in Drury Lane, which had become a squat in early 1969 and later became noted for a mass eviction by the police. In the view of Mojo magazine reviewer Mike Baines, \"Thompson's writing reached maturity on 'Genesis Hall'\". \"Cajun Woman\", which opens the second side of the album, features Dave Swarbrick's fiddle-playing in his first work with Fairport; having no electric pick-ups, the band improvised by smashing open a telephone and attaching the microphone to the instrument with an elastic band."

        "content": "The title arose from the band playing the word game Ghost while travelling to and from gigs. Its object was to \"avoid completing a real word\", and \"Unhalfbricking\" was Sandy Denny's creation.Eric Hayes took the photo on the sleeve design for the UK release, which featured neither album title nor band name. The photo captured Denny's parents, Neil and Edna Denny, standing outside the family home at 9B Arthur Road, Wimbledon, South London, with the band distantly visible through the garden fence. St Mary's Church, Wimbledon, can be seen in the background. Joe Boyd later said \"Unhalfbricking, then, that cover shot was taken in the early spring, right before the crash, I think; and that record came out in June\".Unhalfbricking's cover in the US, released by A&M Records, was even less informative. It consisted of a picture of circus elephants with a small inset image of the band, allegedly because \"the group apparently so upset their American label that they replaced it with an image of trampolining elephants\"."

        "content": "On 11 May 1969, two months before the album was released, drummer Martin Lamble and Jeannie Franklyn, the girlfriend of guitarist Richard Thompson, were killed in a road accident as the band was returning from a concert in Birmingham. Simon Nicol later said: That was a big watershed, I think. In the aftermath, we thought a lot about what to do, whether to call it a day. It had been fun while it lasted but it took a definite effort of will to continue. It had given us a lot but now it had taken away a lot: was it worth it if it was going to cost people their lives? Martin was only 18 or 19 years old. He would have gone on to have been so much more than just another drummer, another musician: there was something very special about him. Ashley Hutchings also said in relation to the album cover photograph: My memory of it is bound up with the terrible car crash. On the back cover we're all eating around a table. The shirt and the leather waistcoat I'm wearing are what I had on when the crash happened. I can clearly remember them being bloodstained. You don't forget things like that.\nUnhalfbricking appeared, therefore, at a difficult time for the group, but was enthusiastically received. After a period of intense reflection about their future they decided to pursue the folk rock idea further and violinist Dave Swarbrick and drummer Dave Mattacks were invited to join full-time for the follow-up, Liege & Lief."

He was less complimentary about \"A Sailor's Life\", regarding it as overlong.The album also gave the band their first UK chart success, spending a total of eight weeks in the UK album chart and reaching number 12. The single \"Si Tu Dois Partir\" spent nine weeks on the UK singles chart and reached number 21. Fairport Convention appeared on Top of the Pops on 14 August 1969, miming to the song and augmented by a roadie, Steve Sparks on percussion.It was voted number 688 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). In 2004 Q magazine placed Unhalfbricking at number 41 in its list of the 50 Greatest British Albums Ever, and in the same year The Observer, describing it as \"a thoroughly English masterpiece\", listed it at number 27 in its Top 100 British Albums. The following year, 2005, it was included in Robert Dimery's  \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". The Sandy Denny track \"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\" was voted \"Favourite Folk Track of All Time\" by listeners in the Radio 2 Folk Awards 2007. In 2010 Unhalfbricking was voted the second best Fairport Convention album after Liege & Lief by Mojo magazine readers."

Tilly, 2003. \nForced by poverty and possible mobilization, Jakov flees to America in 1918., as a war deserter, together with his cousin Luka. The opportunity came when Miho, the owner of the immigration hotel in Pittsburgh sends a letter to Jakov to find him a Croatian wife. A young girl Zorka leaves her home to marry Miho, revolted by the pressure of Jakov's mother, who already married her son with a bit wealthier, but unloved Ivana. In America, Miho understands the situation and instead of marrying Zorka, he is generously sending money home for Jakov's escape. Croats immigrated since the modern migrations ever started. At the beginning of the 20th century they travel mostly as the mariners, as an example four of them were on the first and final voyage of the Titanic. They are leaving in South and North America because of famine and political persecutions. The fate of many immigrants is sublimated in the fate of Jakov and Zorka."

        "content": "In 1977, Alaska, along with Nacho Canut and Carlos Berlanga, formed the band Alaska y los Pegamoides. Later, in 1982, they changed the name to Alaska y Dinarama. The group was popular and influential during La Movida Madrile\u00f1a.  Some of their famous recordings include \"\u00bfA qui\u00e9n le importa?\" and \"Ni t\u00fa ni nadie\". The latter was entered for the Spanish heats of the Eurovision Song Contest in 1985 and later covered by the Mexican group M\u0153nia in 2004 and by the Puerto Rican band Circo in 2005. Their \"\u00bfA qui\u00e9n le importa?\" also was later covered by Mexican pop musician Thal\u00eda in 2002.\nIn 1989, Carlos Berlanga left, and the band transformed once again, this time adopting the name of the American horror film magazine Fangoria. They had already made clear their fascination with American z-movies, with songs like \"Mi novio es un Zombi\" (My Boyfriend Is a Zombie) and \"La rebeli\u00f3n de los electrodom\u00e9sticos\" (The Rebellion of the Household Appliances). With each name change, the band moved further away from punk and further embraced electropop, although strong guitars have generally always been present in their performances.\nSince the birth of Fangoria in 1990, Alaska and Nacho Canut have recorded and launched several albums, always in the dance-pop electronica pattern.  \nSome of their best-known songs include \n\n\"En la Disneylandia del amor\" (1993)\n\"No s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 me das\" (2001)\n\"Eternamente inocente\"(2001)\n\"Retorciendo palabras\" (2004)\n\"Miro la vida pasar\" (2004)\n\"Absolutamente\" (2009)\n\"Dramas y comedias\" (2013)\n\"Fiesta en el infierno\" (2016)Moreover, \"Hombres\" and \"Me Odio Cuando Miento\" were featured in the 2004 movie Cachorro. Their lyrics typically revolve around sadness, loneliness, jealousy and desire: these tragic contents usually contrast with the music, which normally is up-tempo and disco-oriented, although they have recorded downtempo songs as well. Some of their singles have been remixed by Marc Almond (formerly of Soft Cell) and Vive la F\u00eate.\nIn 2009, they released their tenth studio album Absolutamente; the first single \"M\u00e1s es M\u00e1s\" was released before the release of the album. Later they released the second single, \"La Peque\u00f1a Edad de Hielo\". More recently, in 2010, a set of three CDs came out titled El Paso Trascendental del Vodevil a la Astracanada. This release consists of Fangoria's greatest hits and rare recordings, as well as 15 completely re-made versions of their older hits from their previous bands, such as \"Bailando\", \"A qui\u00e9n le importa?\", \"Ni t\u00fa ni nadie\" or \"Perlas ensangrentadas\"."

The album was recorded between August and December 2007 at Abbey Road Studios in London, and mixed in January and March 2008 at The Village Recorder in Los Angeles. Production was handled by Dave Sardy who had previously produced much of the group's sixth studio album, Don't Believe the Truth (2005). Lead guitarist Noel Gallagher wrote a majority of the songs, while three were written by Liam Gallagher as well as one contribution each from Gem Archer and Andy Bell.\nThe album was supported by three singles. The first single, \"The Shock of the Lightning\", was released shortly before the release of the album, on 29 September 2008. In addition to the standard release, there was also a limited edition boxset containing the album on CD, a bonus disc containing extra material and remixes, a DVD with a documentary of the making of the album, four 12\" vinyl discs that contained all the music from the CDs cut in high-quality 45rpm and a hardback book of album artwork.\nDig Out Your Soul received positive reviews from critics for its harder rock and psychedelic rock sound that the band created, and it was a commercial success. The album was supported by a world tour, debuting in Seattle at the WaMu Theater, and continuing for eighteen months. In 2009, the tour concluded (due to Noel Gallagher quitting the band) with major dates at some of the UK's biggest stadiums, notably the new Wembley Stadium, Sunderland's Stadium of Light, and Edinburgh's Murrayfield, along with three hometown shows at Manchester's Heaton Park."

But for the next record I really fancy doing a record where we just completely throw the kitchen sink at it\", he explained. \"We haven't done that since Be Here Now. I'd like to get, like, a 100-piece orchestra and choirs and all that stuff. I think since Standing on the Shoulder of Giants we've been trying to prove a point of just bass, drums, guitar and vocals and nothing fancy. But I kind of like fancy! I'd like to make an absolutely fucking colossal album. You know? Like literally two orchestras, stuff like that.\"In October 2007, Noel revealed more about the record to BBC 6 Music: \"Funnily enough, we all write separately, but for some reason all the songs sound like they've got a common thread. We've been focusing round the grooves more this time, the last album was quite 'songy,' if that makes any sense, I don't know. But it was quite 'songy:' \"The Importance of Being Idle\", \"Let There Be Love\" \u2013 it was quite a British, retro, 60s sounding album. This is kinda focusing round the grooves more. Saying that, we've only done two tracks but all the demos that we've done are great.\" Noel also revealed details about his lyrics for his new songs: \"I've literally got nothing left to write about: I've wrote about being a youth, and I've wrote about being a rock star, and I've wrote about living life in the big city.  I've been re-visiting some of my more psychedelic trips of a younger man, because I remember them all you see...putting them to music.\"In a November 2007 interview with Reuters, singer Liam Gallagher revealed more details on how the record was going: \"All the songs are wrote (sic), this record's gonna be fuckin' rockin'. There's no acoustic on it, man. We rehearsed about 10 tunes before coming in. Three are mine. Some are Noel's, some are Gem's, some are Andy's. We're there for a long time, so we just keep pickin' em off the tree, man. Some are sounding really fucking heavy, and then we're picking some out, and you go, 'Well that doesn't sit with that, right.' So we just keep moving about. We've got plenty of songs. We're not gonna go bored.\"  Gallagher also revealed that the record,\"Will have everything thrown at it. Let's just hope that Noel's learnt his lesson in the studio this time!\"In a 15 June 2008 interview with talkSPORT, Noel said the album was \"colossal\", \"rockin'\" and added \"it's gonna sound great live, which is the most important thing.\" Between various songs on the album are several interludes (such as the sound of someone walking down a beach). Oasis have described these as \"bits inbetween\"."

        "content": "For the recording of Dig Out Your Soul, Oasis reunited with Don't Believe the Truth producer Dave Sardy at Abbey Road Studios in Westminster. Sessions began in July/August 2007 and concluded around Christmas with intermittent breaks. There was a brief period of confusion in which it seemed that Oasis would have had to forgo recording at Abbey Road due to U2 having reserved the recording areas that Oasis wished to use far in advance. The issue was resolved when Noel bought U2's spot in cash without the band's knowledge; this was possible due to the fact that the studios gave preference to cash payments over credit, which U2 had been booked with. Zak Starkey was made an official member during the sessions.The album art was created by artist Julian House. Ralph Steadman suggested the phrase \"Dig Out Your Soul\" for the album's title, a line in the song \"To Be Where There's Life\". According to Noel, \"We gave him [Steadman] the album, he listened to it and we gave him the lyrics\u2026 He came back with a list of titles and one of them was Dig Out Your Soul. Noel's only instruction was \"As long as we don't call it Oasis I don't give a fuck\". Mixing took place in Los Angeles, and was slowed by constant equipment failure. After the album was completed and the band began discussions with several record companies with which to release it. In August 2008, Reprise Records announced that it would distribute Dig Out Your Soul in North America. The songs \"(I Wanna Live in a Dream in My) Record Machine\" and \"Come on Outside\" were planned to be on Dig Out Your Soul, but were ultimately left off as according to Noel, Liam \"ran out of time\" to record them."

Many critics lauded Dig Out Your Soul as one of the strongest albums ever recorded by the band, and noted that \"it seems Oasis have made something that can happily play alongside Morning Glory.\" Jonathan Cohen of Billboard says that with Dig Out Your Soul, the group \"Gets back to its stripped-down rock roots\" and that the opening song, \"Bag It Up\" harks back to Definitely Maybe's \"Columbia\". Luke Bainbridge of The Observer gave the album 4 stars out of 5, saying \"You could say that if Definitely Maybe was their Stone Roses, Dig Out Your Soul is their Second Coming. It won't win them any new fans, but those that believed the truth last time will dig this.\"Not all reviews have been positive, however; Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone magazine gave the album a 2\u00bd out of 5 stars. Rosen said of the new album that, \"Dig Out Your Soul is an almost comically generic Oasis release, from its preponderance of plodding midtempo rockers (\"Bag It Up\", \"Waiting for the Rapture\") to the vaguely Indian raga-flavoured psychedelic anthems (\"To Be Where There's Life\").\"In the UK, the album sold 90,000 copies on its first day of release, making it the second fastest selling album of 2008, behind Coldplay's Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends. It debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 1, with first week sales of 200,866 copies, making it the 51st fastest selling album ever in the UK. The album debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200 in the US, with 53,000 copies sold. It is the highest chart position of any Oasis album in the US since 1997's Be Here Now which debuted at number 2, but fewer total opening week sales than Don't Believe the Truth. It has spent a total of 32 weeks in the French Albums Chart, the most ever by any Oasis album."

It was recorded in Los Angeles when the band were on their second concert tour of North America. In some early performances Robert Plant introduced the song as \"Killing Floor\"; an early UK pressing of Led Zeppelin II showed the title as \"Killing Floor\" and was credited to Chester Burnett (Howlin' Wolf's real name). For the second and third North American tours the song evolved into \"The Lemon Song\", with Plant often improvising lyrics onstage (the opening lyrics to both songs are identical).\nOther lyrics, notably \"squeeze (my lemon) till the juice runs down my leg,\"  can be traced to Robert Johnson's \"Travelling Riverside Blues\".  It is likely that Johnson borrowed this himself, from a song recorded earlier in the same year (1937) called \"She Squeezed My Lemon\" (by Arthur McKay). The song also references Albert King's \"Cross-Cut Saw\"\nIn December 1972, Arc Music, owner of the publishing rights to Howlin' Wolf's songs, sued Led Zeppelin for copyright infringement on \"The Lemon Song\". The parties settled out of court. Though the amount was not disclosed, Howlin' Wolf received a check for US$45,123 from Arc Music immediately following the suit, and subsequent releases included a co-songwriter credit for him.\"The Lemon Song\" was performed live on Led Zeppelin's first three concert tours of the United States (on the first tour as \"Killing Floor\"), before being dropped from their live set in late 1969. However, the 'squeeze my lemon' sequence continued to be inserted into the \"Whole Lotta Love\" medley and ad-libbed elsewhere.\nJimmy Page performed this song on his tour with the Black Crowes in 1999. A version of \"The Lemon Song\" performed by Page and the Black Crowes can be found on the album Live at the Greek."

The magazine has covered the career of U2 since the late 1970s. Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor first talked to Hot Press about her lesbianism.The magazine has been at the centre of several controversies: for example, Hot Press writer Stuart Clark was interviewing Oasis band member and songwriter Noel Gallagher when Gallagher found out that his brother Liam would not take the stage for that evening's performance, and the band came close to splitting up.Hot Press was at the centre of a legal dispute over the copyright of the term De Dannan in 2009 after it featured an advertisement using the term to promote a new tour by the traditional group.In September 2009, an interview conducted by Olaf Tyaransen with the comedian Tommy Tiernan at Electric Picnic 2009 proved controversial when Tiernan made some remarks which were later perceived as antisemitic. The comments were reported in the Irish and international media; however, both Tyaransen and Hot Press editor Niall Stokes, as well as Tiernan himself, defended them as being taken out of context.In 2020, in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic lock down in Ireland, Hot Press held a set of online music sessions called the Lockdown Sessions featuring artists such as Celaviedmai, Doppler, and Tebi Rex."

Of this issue, 3.6 million copies were published, with every member of the Nintendo Fun Club receiving a free copy.\nFrom the beginning, Nintendo Power focuses heavily on providing game strategy, reviews, and previews of upcoming games. In mid-1998, Nintendo Power first allowed outside advertising in the magazine, formerly reserved for Nintendo-based products only. In its early years, ads only appeared in the first and last few pages of the magazine, leaving no ads to break up the magazine's editorial content.\nIn July 2005, Nintendo Power introduced a new design to appeal to a limited gaming audience, including a new logo and article format. Along with the cosmetic overhaul came a greater focus on Nintendo fans, staff reviews, rumor-milling, and fan service including an expanded and enhanced reader mail segment (known as \"Pulse\") and a revamped \"Community\" section. Nintendo introduced a new incentive promotional offer that involved the registration of three Nintendo (or Nintendo affiliated) products through Nintendo.com to receive a free three issue trial subscription to Nintendo Power. Later, the magazine changed its focus from game strategies and cheat codes to mainly news, previews, and articles on upcoming games.\nOn September 19, 2007, Nintendo officially announced that the large magazine publisher Future US would begin publishing Nintendo Power. The company's first official issue was released in October, as issue #222 (December 2007). It was also revealed that circulation would be increased to 13 issues a year, with the extra magazine being a holiday season bonus issue.

        "content": "The magazine was founded by Gail Tilden with support from Nintendo's first Fun Club \"President\" Howard Phillips, himself an avid gamer. While the Fun Club News focused solely on games made in-house by Nintendo, Nintendo Power was created to allow for reviews of games produced by those licensed by Nintendo, such as Konami, Capcom, and the like. Nintendo Power's mascot in the late 1980s and early 1990s was Nester, a comic character created by the staff at Work House, Japan. After Phillips left the company, Nester became the magazine's sole mascot. Early issues of the magazine featured a two-page Howard and Nester comic, which was later replaced with the two-page Nester's Adventures, later reduced to one page, and eventually dropped altogether. Subsequently, Mario replaced Nester as the mascot of the magazine. Later, during the early 2000s, the magazine made another mascot out of its Senior Writer, Alan Averill. Apparently very camera-shy, Averill himself never appeared in any photos; rather, he was represented by a plush toy of a Blue Slime from Dragon Quest. Fans often clamored to see what Averill actually looked like, but the magazine continued to substitute with photos of the toy, and even claimed that Alan was, in fact, a Blue Slime. Eventually, Averill retired from Nintendo Power, joining Nintendo of America's localization department. To this day, most fans have never seen a real image of Averill. The inclusion of a photo of Mr. T in the Player's Pulse section became a running gag in the early half of 2005. Late in the magazine's life, running gags centered on Chuck Norris references and jokes at the expense of writer Chris Shepperd.\nDuring the early 1990s, the magazine used what was a unique and very expensive promotion: giving away a free copy of the new NES game Dragon Quest to every new subscriber. This promotion was in part a move on Nintendo's part to promote RPG games and gain the benefit of sales of series like Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest in Japan) and Final Fantasy. The game had not sold nearly as well as Nintendo had anticipated, leaving the company with a large number of unsold cartridges. The promotion both helped the company get rid of the unsold merchandise, and won the magazine thousands of new subscribers.Following the release of the Super NES, the magazine featured lengthy, continuous comic stories based on Super Mario World and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. After these stories ended, they were replaced by similar multi-issue stories based on Star Fox, Super Metroid, and later, Nintendo 64 games such as Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire and Blast Corps. It had several comics based on the animated series of Pok\u00e9mon and Kirby: Right Back at Ya!. Toward the end, it included short excerpts based on Custom Robo and Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. It included a very short Metroid Prime comic, and another story based on the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon games translated from the original Japanese version."

Nester was created by Howard Phillips, \"President\" of the Nintendo Fun Club and a former editor of Nintendo Power, to be the supporting character in his comic strip, Howard & Nester. The comic strips generally advertised new games, often by dream sequences where Nester was actually a given video game character. From 1989 to 1993, The Nintendo Power Awards featured Nester-shaped trophies and were referred to in the magazine as the \"Nesters\" in reference to the Oscars.\nIn the June 1991 issue (Volume 25), Phillips was written out of the strip after his real-life counterpart left Nintendo to work for LucasArts. The strip was retitled Nester's Adventures the following issue and continued publication until Volume 55 (December 1993). Nester, now as a college student, appeared in Nintendo Power issue #100. He is seen again in issue #231, the magazine's twentieth anniversary, here a grown man with a son new to Nintendo. Nester's final appearance in Nintendo Power is in the final issue, Volume 285, in a comic titled \"Nester & Max\", where he is seen reading and lamenting the final issue.Nester is featured in a few video games that were released while the character was in the magazine. His first appearance was as a commentator in NES Play Action Football. Other appearances include the ending of To the Earth. Nester is the main character in Nester's Funky Bowling for the Virtual Boy, which also introduces his sister Hester. The character of Lark in Pilotwings 64 for the Nintendo 64 was based on Nester. Several NES games feature the name \"NESTER\" as one of the pre-set names on high-score lists, or a default character name such as in To the Earth.  The original NES release of Dragon Warrior references both Howard and Nester through character dialog, however this was removed in the later Game Boy Color version.  He is mentioned in one line of dialogue in the game StarTropics. A DLC microgame in WarioWare D.I.Y. created by Nintendo Power called Funky Boxing (a loose reference to Nester's Funky Bowling) does not have any apparent references to the character, but if the game is opened in the editor, the player's boxer is named \"NESTER\"."

Determined to bring Suede back into the mainstream, frontman Brett Anderson decided that the sound of the new album would be the complete opposite of Dog Man Star. \"I think the next album will be quite simple, actually. I'd really like to write a straightforward pop album. Just ten hits.\" The guitarist to replace Butler was the 17-year-old Richard Oakes, who beat 500 other applicants for the role. Instead of applying for the job like everyone else, Oakes was auditioned on the strength of an impromptu demo tape he sent to the Suede fan club. Despite Oakes' smooth integration into his new role and the band's rejuvenated spirit, Anderson was tired of touring and was keen to get back in the studio with his new songwriting partner. He recalled: \"it was becoming really not much fun touring an album that wasn't made by the band.\" At the time Suede were fatigued with being on tour, which was reflected in the B-side, \"Have You Ever Been This Low\"."

        "content": "After some hesitation over who was going to produce the album, the band decided to continue with long-time producer Ed Buller due to their strong working relationship over the years. Other candidates the band considered were Flood and Brian Eno, however they could not fit the band into their schedules. Buller had in fact welcomed a parting of the ways due to the fractious relationship between the band members during the recording of the last album. However, in friendly discussions with Anderson, Buller found that his ideas about a possible new Suede direction tallied almost exactly with the band's own: to write less complex, more immediate songs; to use heavier drum sounds, play fewer guitar solos and only employ string sections on a couple of songs such as \"She\" and \"The Chemistry Between Us.\" The album was recorded between December 1995 and June 1996 at various locations. To prepare for its recording, the band had immersed themselves in T. Rex's 1972 album The Slider and its successor, Tanx; as Buller stated that his aspiration was to make \"The Slider for the Nineties.\" T. Rex became the blueprint of the recording process, as the band spent a month at The Town House just working on drums.Buller explained how the recording process worked: \"Basically, what we did, is that every track started with acoustic guitar, bongos, tambourine and Brett [Anderson], so it all started life pretty much the same way that Marc Bolan recorded all of his stuff originally.\" Bass player Mat Osman recalls how Buller was keen on making the album simple. \"He was really keen on using all those devices: the big repeated end, the handclaps, the straightforward chorus, make it big and obvious.\" In an interview on the eve of the album's release, Anderson stated: \"I wanted it to be a complete turnover from the last album, which was very dark and dank ... I wanted it to be communicative and understandable.\" Two songs which made it onto Coming Up had already been written in the early days of Suede. \"Lazy\" and \"By the Sea\" were two of Anderson's own compositions. \"By the Sea\" was actually written when Suede were recording their first album, which is why the song's opening line is similar to \"So Young\". Unlike the tense and chaotic recording of Dog Man Star, which according to Anderson was mostly written \"by post\", in a shift-like format, the new material was far more celebratory in both its development and execution.As opposed to the previous album which followed a stringent pattern of Butler composing music for Anderson's lyrics, Coming Up was a more collaborative project. Anderson stated: \"Coming Up was more of a meritocracy \u2013 if something was good enough, it didn't matter what the source was.\" Songs such as \"By the Sea\" and \"She\" required the use of keyboards. Faced with the problem as to how to play them live, Suede recruited Simon Gilbert's cousin Neil Codling, who made his debut at a fan-club gig in January 1996. Buller has stated that the reason why the album has a much better sound than the previous albums is that he had minimal involvement in the mixing process, mixing only two songs. Buller credits much of the album's success to Dave Bascombe, who mixed the majority of the songs. According to Buller, having an outside observer mix the record with \"fresh ears\" enhances the overall production quality. Bascombe's input on \"Trash\" was crucial, as it was his idea to speed up the vocals. One of Suede's popular B-sides \"Young Men\" was left off the album, as Buller felt it was \"too dark\" and not as \"poppy [and] in your face\" as other songs on the record."

Its singles were much more successful than those of their second LP, while the lyrical content concerns the band's disaffection at the mid-90s hedonistic, celebrity-obsessed culture; \"Beautiful Ones\" and \"She\" are caricatures of British yuppies, celebrities and heroin-chic models. \"Beautiful Ones\" was originally titled \"Dead Leg\" after Osman threatened to give Oakes a dead leg if he was unable to write a top ten single. According to Anderson, \"The Chemistry Between Us\" is about \"the emptiness of it all\", when it comes to taking drugs with strangers who have no common ground other than being high on drugs. The main refrain of the song is \"Class A, Class B, is that the only chemistry between us.\""

        "content": "Reviews were generally positive and seemed to respect Suede's new poppy and direct sound. James Delingpole of The Daily Telegraph wrote: \"Coming Up is their defiant reminder of what made Suede so special [...] If Dog Man Star was Diamond Dogs, then this is Suede's Ziggy Stardust \u2013 extravagant, steeped in glam and unashamedly poppy.\" Roy Wilkinson of Select called it: \"a wondrous pop album, simultaneously immediate and full of scope, a lovely, charming mix of absolute beauty and the thrillingly awkward.\" Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian felt that even despite the album's simplistic composition of \"vibrant three-minute howla-longs\", it still manages to avoid being too mainstream and incomparable to rivals Oasis and Blur. Andy Gill of The Independent, however was a harsh critic of the album. In contrast to the band's earlier work, he wrote: \"two albums and one guitarist later, they sound utterly mined out.\" He added: \"in many ways, it's a step back from Dog Man Star \u2013 and their manner grows increasingly obnoxious.\"Despite its success in the UK and Europe, Coming Up did not win an audience in America, partially because of its later release in April 1997 and partially because Suede only supported it with a three-city tour. Critical reception, however was generally positive stateside. Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle wrote: \"Oakes more than fills the boots of his predecessor, and the new CD is a pure pop pleasure, thick and sinewy and terribly, cooly [sic] British.\" Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club had similar views, saying: \"The London Suede should, by all laws of musical logic, have disappeared by now. However, after surviving a name change, the replacement of co-songwriter/guitarist Bernard Butler with an obscure 17-year old, and more than a few changes in musical fashion, the band has returned with a third album that's more consistent and accessible than anything it's produced before.\" James Hunter of Spin said that \"the band pushes its case by ascending to heights of absolutely lucid songcraft that, in this often fuzzy era, feels exhilarating.\" Rolling Stone critic Elysa Gardner noted their \"concise melodies and taut, brashly energetic arrangements\".Other critics were favourable, however with the caveat of highlighting the album's simplicity. In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote: \"The most striking thing about Coming Up is the simplicity [...] As a statement of purpose, Coming Up is unimpeachable. Though it doesn't break any new ground for the band \u2014 unless you count the new-found sense of optimism.\" With similar views, Kevin Courtney of The Irish Times wrote: \"Sometimes the songs seem a little too simple and throwaway, but Anderson tosses them aside with such aplomb, you can't wait to pick up after him.\"Suede embarked on a short tour of the US and Canada in May 1997 to support the album, but fell upon bad fortune when their equipment got stolen after playing a sold-out show in Boston, Massachusetts on 17 May."

The album was certified as platinum by the BPI in January 1997. It had sold 425,000 copies in the UK as of July 1997. Excluding the US, where Coming Up had a later release date, year-end worldwide sales were roughly 600,000, with the top markets being the UK, Scandinavia and Japan. Worldwide sales reached 1.5 million by 1998. The proportion of worldwide sales in the US, however was much lower than the sales of the first album. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Coming Up has sold about 40,000 copies in the US as of September 2008. The record sold well in Scandinavia, with \"Trash\" becoming the band's first overseas number one single, topping the charts in Finland. The album charted at number one in both Sweden and Denmark, and number three in Norway. The album was also certified as Gold in Norway and Platinum in Sweden. Anderson saw the funny side of their newfound popularity, saying: \"They went mad for it in Scandinavia, maybe because they're all depressed sex maniacs or something.\""

Canonized in 1903, he is one of the patron saints of the Archdiocese of Dublin.\nCaomh\u00e1n of Inisheer, the patron saint of Inisheer, Aran Islands, is properly anglicized Cavan or Kevan, but often also referred to as \"Kevin\".\nThe name was rarely given before the 20th century. In Ireland an early bearer of the anglicised name was Kevin Izod O'Doherty (1823\u20131905) a Young Irelander and politician; it gained popularity from the Gaelic revival of the late nineteenth century, with Kevin Barry and Kevin O'Higgins prominent in the Irish revolutionary period.  Later it was \"widely adopted throughout the English-speaking world\", surging in popularity during the 1950s. In the United States the name's popularity peaked at rank 11 in 1963.  It has steadily decreased in popularity since then, but was still given with moderate frequency in the 2010s, at rank 89 as of 2016. Kevin fell out of the US Top 100 the following year and now ranks at Number 156. \nThe name followed a similar trajectory in the United Kingdom, gaining popularity in the 1950s, peaking in the 1960s, gradually declining in the 1970s to 1980s, and falling out of the top 100 most popularly given names by the 1990s.Oxford's A Dictionary of First Names suggests that anglicized Kevin may have influenced the adoption of Kelvin (in origin a river name) as a modern given name, which peaked in popularity at about the same time, albeit to a much lesser extent (peaking at rank 209 as of 1961 in the US).In mainland Europe, the name picked up popularity in the 1980s and 1990s via such American pop culture figures as actor Kevin Costner, singer Kevin Richardson, and, most prominently, Kevin McCallister, Macaulay Culkin's character in the Christmas comedy film Home Alone. \"Kevin\" was notorious for being extremely popular among lower-class parents between the end of the 1980s and the 2000s. The name peaked markedly in the early 1990s, reaching first rank in France (sometimes spelt K\u00e9vin)  during 1989\u20131994, during 1991\u20131992 in Switzerland and in 1991 in Germany. In German markets, Home Alone was released as \"Kevin \u2013 Allein zu Haus\". Especially in Germany, the name became associated with low social status, an attitude popularised in German journalism based on a 2009 master thesis on primary teachers' reactions to children's given names. Kevinismus has become German short-hand for negative social preconceptions about trendy or exotic names. The name has had similar negative connotations in France."

        "content": "Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha helped found the weekly magazine Tygodnik Powszechny, whose first edition was published on 24 March 1945, during the closing months of World War II. Initially, its editorial staff had four people: Jan Piwowarczyk, a priest; Jerzy Turowicz, editor-in-chief for many years; Konstanty Turowski and Maria Czapska. Later, they were joined by Zofia Starowieyska\u2013Morstinowa, Stefan Kisielewski, Leopold Tyrmand, Antoni Go\u0142ubiew, Pawe\u0142 Jasienica (until he was arrested by the communists in 1948), Stanis\u0142aw Stomma, Hanna Malewska and J\u00f3zefa Golmont\u2013Hennelowa.\nIn 1953, the weekly was suspended and lost its printing house after it had refused to print the obituary of Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. From 1953 to 1956, it was published by new editors, representing the pro-government PAX Association and was informally known as Tygodnik Paxowski. The same format was used and numbering was continuous during that period although none of the previous editors still worked for the paper.\nAfter the 1956 Polish October, the \"Thaw\" allowed the original editors were able to resume control of the magazine in December. Columnists have included prominent clerics, such as Karol Wojty\u0142a (later Pope John Paul II), academics and poets, journalists and other writers, including W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bartoszewski, Jerzy Zawieyski, Jacek Wo\u017aniakowski, Stefan Wilkanowicz, Adam Szostkiewicz, Leszek Ko\u0142akowski, Stanis\u0142aw Lem, Zbigniew Herbert, Wojciech Karpi\u0144ski, Tadeusz Kudli\u0144ski and Czes\u0142aw Zgorzelski.\nCzes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz published his poems in Tygodnik Powszechny for many years. In 1945, he prepared a handwritten volume of poems, Wiersze p\u00f3\u0142-perskie, for Jerzy Turowicz, the editor. Forced into exile to the United States, Mi\u0142osz continued to publish in the magazine. After he received the Nobel Prize, it was the only magazine in which Mi\u0142osz published his poems.\nIn the late 1950s, the newspaper became affiliated with the officially recognized political party Znak, which was newly organized in the wake of the \"Thaw\". When Znak helped establish the Solidarity movement, Father J\u00f3zef Tischner, one of the writers of the Krakov edition, became its chaplain.\nAfter martial law was declared, the magazine suspended its publication for several months. Since 1982, Tygodnik Powszechny has been published continuously.\nAfter Wojty\u0142a was elected as Pope John Paul II, Tygodnik Powszechny became the most popular vehicle for his teachings in Poland. For a long time, it was the only magazine in the world to have gained an interview with the new pope, which was published 3 August 1980.\nIn the 1980s, the magazine informally represented the Polish democratic opposition. It was sometimes regarded as the only legal oppositional magazine in the People's Republic of Poland (PRL). In 1987, it published a controversial essay by Jan B\u0142o\u0144ski, \"The Poor Poles Look at the Ghetto\" (\"Biedni Polacy patrz\u0105 na getto\"), which explored the historic relations between Catholic and Jewish Poles, and the experiences of the Holocaust during World War II.\nSince the 1990s, part of the church hierarchy has criticized Tygodnik Powszechny for what is considered to be its overly-liberal outlook. That does not reflect the parochial distribution of the magazine.\nIn 1998, Maria Zmarz-Koczanowicz produced the documentary Ordinary Kindness (Zwyczajna dobro\u0107), which told the story of Turowicz.\nIn 1999, after the death of Turowicz, the chief editor became Father Adam Boniecki.\nIn April 2007, the ITI Group purchased 49% of the magazine. Since 5 December 2007, Tygodnik Powszechny has been published in a smaller size. Its format and editorial staff were also changed. \nIn 2014, the magazine has changed its logo, layout and the format to attract younger readers."

It has presented an open ecumenical view of Polish Catholicism, called by the editors an 'open Catholicism'. Its goal is a dialogue. Persons with non-Catholic ideas are invited to take part in printed debates. According to an analysis by Jaros\u0142aw Gowin, presented in his book Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 w czasach wolno\u015bci (\"Church in the Times of Freedom\"), the magazine is one of the main representatives of \"open\" Catholicism, inspired by Catholic personalism.\nSergiusz Kowalski, who analysed the history of the journal from 1993 to 1995, wrote, \"The authors of Tygodnik Powszechny appreciate moderation, openness, readiness to dialogue and compromise, looking for a modus vivendi between liberal democracy and Church, between modernity and tradition\" (Kowalski 1997: 148)."

After 1989, Tygodnik Powszechny was believed to represent only one political party, the Democratic Union, which was later transformed into the Freedom Union. Many people involved in the magazine participated in the political changes of the era (J\u00f3zefa Hennelowa, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Krzysztof Koz\u0142owski).\nThe critics of the Cracow weekly magazine often quote the letter written by John Paul II on 15 May 1995, on the occasion of the magazine's 50th anniversary: \n\nThe year 1989 brought Poland deep changes connected with the downfall of the communist system. Resumption of independence paradoxically coincided with an increased assault of secular left-wing parties and liberal groups directed against the Church, the Episcopate as well as against the Pope. I felt it especially in the context of my last visit to Poland in 1991. The point was to erase from the memory of citizens what was the role of the Church in the nation within the space of the last years. Accusations and slanders about clericalism were multiplying as well as those about the alleged intention of the Church to rule Poland and about hindering political emancipation in the Polish society. Forgive me, if I say that those influences were also visible in Tygodnik Powszechny. In those difficult times, unfortunately the Church did not find in it any support and defense which in a way it could have expected: \u201cit did not feel cherished enough\u201d \u2013 like I once said.\u2013 Letter of 15 May 1995 from John Paul II to Jerzy Turowicz, editor-in-chief, Tygodnik Powszechny"

A second single, Rossi's \"Black Veils of Melancholy\" (with organist Roy Lynes' non-album track \"To Be Free\" as the B-side), flopped and has even been called \"a carbon copy of 'Pictures of Matchstick Men'\". The third single, \"Ice in the Sun\", was written for the band by Marty Wilde and Ronnie Scott (not the jazz musician), with the Rossi/Parfitt composition \"When My Mind Is Not Live\" as the B-side. It reached No. 8 in the UK, and No. 29 in Canada.\nThe album itself was released on 27 September 1968, and failed to make the UK album charts. The band planned to release a fourth single from the album \u2013 \"Technicolour Dreams\" backed with the Wilde/Scott composition \"Paradise Flat\" \u2013 but this was withdrawn after a few days in favour of a non-album single release early the following year. The new single, Rossi and Parfitt's \"Make Me Stay a Bit Longer\", with bassist Alan Lancaster's \"Auntie Nellie\" as the B-side, was released on 31 January 1969. As well as getting the \"thumbs up\" from a majority of the record reviewers, this single was also something of a landmark for the group, as it would be their final release to credit them as \"the\" Status Quo."

The most prominent explanation is that it is composed of \"ok\" and \"z\". In various modern Turkic languages and in Proto-Turkic language \"ok(h)\" means \"arrow\". Only in Proto-Turkic language, \"ok\" also means \"clan\", and/or \"nation\". Again, only in Proto-Turkic language, \"z\" is the plural suffix. In modern Turkish \"z\" is not the plural suffix anymore, in general. Therefore \"okz\" means \"clans\", \"nations\", and/or \"arrows\". \nFinally, \"O\u011fuz\" is used both as given names and as names of some of the Turkic clans. O\u011fuz T\u00fcrks are the southwestern branch of Turkish clan system. \"G\u00f6ko\u011fuz\" was a group of O\u011fuz T\u00fcrks who migrated to northwest and named as Gagauz in modern times. There are also groups named as \u00dc\u00e7o\u011fuz (Three O\u011fuz), Sekizo\u011fuz (Eight O\u011fuz), Dokuzo\u011fuz (Nine O\u011fuz), etc. One of the earliest rulers of the Turkic people is also named \"Oghuz Khan\".

        "content": "On 21 May, Thierry Suc, one of Farmer's producers, announced that the first single from the album would be \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" and that it would be released on radio on 19 June 2008. On 7 June 2008, a 30-second music clip was leaked to the Internet as well as the official cover art. On 14 June, the whole song was available to the Internet. At the time, as the origins of this song were, however, unclear, it had thus led many to believe that this leaked song was actually a remix due to its lack of lyrics.\nSurprisingly, on the night from 13 to 14 June, the e-compil site, the official platform for downloading of Universal Music, proposed, for a few hours only, to legally download the song, probably by mistake. On 16 June, \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" was aired for the first time on Radio Jeune Reims, at 8:20 pm, although it was announced that NRJ should have the exclusivity of the first broadcast, on 19 June, at 7:00 am. According to the French newspaper Le Parisien, the DJ Martin Solveig participated in one of the song remixes. As scheduled, on 19 June, several radio stations broadcast \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\", including NRJ, Delta FM and RTL. The song was then also available digitally on musicMe, virginmega.fr and iTunes, but only one version. A few days later, an unofficial CDR promo (unknown remix) of \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" was circulated and received attention from high-profile DJs. Finally, it was announced that the song would be released as a physical single on 18 August. On 4 July, certain French radio stations began to broadcast the radio edit version of the remix produced by Martin Solveig.\nOn the occasion of the single release, Farmer formed for the first time a partnership with a mobile phone company. So, the SFR subscribers received two SMS announcing first when the song would be available digitally on its site, then when the three excerpts of the music video would be broadcast on its site. On 11 July, the newspaper Info Music Hebdo said that the CD single would be released in a limited edition (50,000 copies) and that the CD maxi would contain remixes by Tomer G and Manhattan Clique who had previously worked with Farmer for \"Slipping Away (Crier la vie)\". In early September, TF1 promoted the song airing some excerpts between the programmes and the fully music video in the night."

        "content": "The song has an electro and techno-sexy feel and the lyrics play with sonorities, including alliterations. The only natural instruments audible in the song are piano and percussion; all others are effects. According to Discordance.fr, \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" is \"an unstructured song, not a summer hit with an easy approach\", and its music is \"hypnotic\". It can be assimilated to \"Psychiatric\", \"La Ronde triste\" or \"Alice\" because of \"its short text and its rather dub\". The song \"amounts to a couplet repeated in buckle, a spoken bridge, and many choirs\". The text \"remains partially incomprehensible without reading official lyrics\". The electronic sound has a \"more metallic rhythmic\" than Farmer's previous singles and constitutes \"a remarkable artistic experiment\". Psychologist Hugues Royer said that the message of the song is to \"shake the boredom to find again the desire\", to \"promote sex therapy\" to \"reset the appetite for life\".Interviewed by Claire Chazal in the news broadcasting of 31 August, 8:00 pm, on TF1, Farmer explained that the title of the song was a reference to \"D\u00e9senchant\u00e9e\", her 1991 number-one hit, in which the word \"g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" is mentioned. On the cover of the various formats, Farmer is shown naked from the back. She has a green jade prayer beads around the neck that goes from the back to the buttocks and ends with a G-string-shaped cross and has in her back an enormous scar whose threads form the letters IY'H which mean in Hebrew : \"With God's will\". Farmer's position on the cover resembles the subject of Man Ray's 1924 painting Le Violon d'Ingres, as well as that on the cover of her single \"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\"."

        "content": "The music video was shot over two days (9 and 10 June) in Prague, Czech Republic. Polydor and French magazine Paris-Match announced that Bruno Aveillan, a director who has directed several television commercials for companies such as Perrier, Louis Vuitton, Orange, Nintendo, Nike and Philips, directed this 4:30 music video. About thirty actors as well as the dancers of Cave Canem troupe feature in it. According to Aveillan, extras perform \"a resolutely modern choreography, full of unexpected.\" In addition, a Phantom camera, ordinarily devoted to the scientific research, was used for the shooting. Patricia Aveillan, Bruno Aveillan's mother, made the dress worn by Farmer in the video and explained in an interview that she was informed just ten days before the shooting. Her daughter and her son-in-law also participated in the shooting. The photographer Claude Gassian attended the shooting of the video.\nThe video shows Farmer lying on an operating table in a laboratory, surrounded by scientists. When the music begins, she wakes up, unties her strips, gets up, and throws blue laser beams from her palms to the doctors and the militaries. Suddenly, they begin to perform choreographied sexual intercourses (men with men, women with women, women with men) which eventually end as an orgy, while Farmer goes out of the laboratory.On 26 June, SFR site revealed an excerpt from the music video for \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\". Two other excerpts were broadcast on 1 and 2 July. The video was eventually fully aired on television on 10 July and immediately available on several official websites such as TF1.fr, Music SFR and universalmusic.fr. In Russia, \"MTV Russia\" channel aired regularly the music video.This video was generally well received in the media. For example, Musique.evous said: \"Its atmosphere is consistent with the single and the universe of its performer: cold, careful and erotic. (...) The production is impeccable and the greatest attention was paid to lighting, the texture of the bodies and the special effects\". Many critics have noticed that the video was \"erotic\" and \"provocative\", and some have thought it was inspired by Luc Besson's film The Fifth Element (futuristic atmosphere, red hair, body covered with strips) or Le Parfum. According to La Meuse, gay scenes \u2013 including two soldiers who kiss and undress each other \u2013 would be \"a wink to the fascination that Farmer has always exerted on the gay public\". Royer said this video is \"peppered with special effects worthy of the early career [of Farmer]\" and conveys a message \"which invites its listeners to come out of coma where they languish sex to engage in sexual intercourses without taboo. (...) The singer achieves the challenge of updating of the message of \"Libertine\" without giving the feeling of repetition.\"In January 2009, when the third single from the album was released, it was revealed that the music video for \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" as well as that of \"Si j'avais au moins...\", were part of a short film named The Farmer Project. The action takes place in a country in Eastern Europe in the 1950s or 1960s. It begins with Farmer, who portrays a creature with supernatural powers, who is captured by two policemen and studied in a laboratory. At this point, the music video for \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" starts."

It featured high production standards, as Musica had identified Iwan Fals' talents from his existing recordings, and were willing to invest in the album. Guest stars on the album include Idris Sardi, wh played violin on Guru Oemar Bakrie, while Jazz violinist Luluk Purwanto plays throughout the album, a role that she reprised on the album's follow-up, 'Opini'.\nThe album contains many of Iwan Fals most popular songs, and contains mostly wistful ballads, but also the lively country and western-style Guru Oemar Bakri and blackly comic 'Ambulance Zig Zag'.\nIwan Fals' early influence from Bob Dylan is evident in the richly descriptive documentary lyrics, and also in the heavy use of harmonica. The album also features country-style banjo and violin."

        "content": "The July 2008 issue of Vogue Italia featured only black models (photographed by Steven Meisel), with the articles pertaining to black women in the media, arts and entertainment. The magazine claimed to release this issue as a response to widespread criticism that fashion magazines, worldwide, do not feature more black cover models. Industry insiders have claimed that advertisers believe any magazine issue featuring a black cover model is \"unable\" to sell, or will sell considerably less than issues with non-black cover models. This belief, along with the formation of a protest group in New York City that challenges racism in the industry, convinced Italian Vogue's editor, Franca Sozzani to create this issue. Interestingly, rather than the issue not selling, it became the highest-selling issue of Italian Vogue in history, and had run-out of print twice, which marked the first time in Cond\u00e9 Nast history that the magazine reprinted an issue to satisfy demand. The reprinted copies displayed headlines as \"Most Wanted Issue Ever\" and \"First Reprint\".However, even though the advertising pages increased by 30%, there was a \"glaring lack of black models\" in the issue. Meisel said: \"I've asked my advertising clients so many times, 'Can we use a black girl?' They say no. Advertisers say black models don't sell.\""

        "content": "Proto-Indo-European nominals include nouns, adjectives, and pronouns. Their grammatical forms and meanings have been reconstructed by modern linguists, based on similarities found across all Indo-European languages. This article discusses nouns and adjectives; Proto-Indo-European pronouns are treated elsewhere.\nThe Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) had eight or nine cases, three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and probably originally two genders (animate and neuter), with the animate later splitting into the masculine and the feminine.\nNominals fell into multiple different declensions. Most of them had word stems ending in a consonant (called athematic stems) and exhibited a complex pattern of accent shifts and/or vowel changes (ablaut) among the different cases.\nTwo declensions ended in a vowel (*-o/e-) and are called thematic; they were more regular and became more common during the history of PIE and its older daughter languages.\nPIE very frequently derived nominals from verbs. Just as English giver and gift are ultimately related to the verb give, *d\u00e9h\u2083tors 'giver' and *d\u00e9h\u2083nom 'gift' are derived from *deh\u2083- 'to give', but the practice was much more common in PIE. For example, *p\u1e53ds 'foot' was derived from *ped- 'to tread', and *d\u00f3mh\u2082s 'house' from *demh\u2082- 'to build'."

        "content": "The basic structure of Proto-Indo-European nouns and adjectives was the same as that of PIE verbs. A lexical word (as would appear in a dictionary) was formed by adding a suffix (S) onto a root (R) to form a stem. The word was then inflected by adding an ending (E) to the stem.\nThe root indicates a basic concept, often a verb (e.g. *deh\u2083- 'give'), while the stem carries a more specific nominal meaning based on the combination of root and suffix (e.g. *d\u00e9h\u2083-tor- 'giver', *d\u00e9h\u2083-o- 'gift'). Some stems cannot clearly be broken up into root and suffix altogether, as in *h\u2082r\u0325t\u1e31o- 'bear'.\nThe ending carries grammatical information, including case, number, and gender. Gender is an inherent property of a noun but is part of the inflection of an adjective, because it must agree with the gender of the noun it modifies.Thus, the general morphological form of such words is R+S+E:\nroot+suffix\u23dfstem+ending\u23dfword{\\displaystyle \\underbrace {\\underbrace {\\mathrm {root+suffix} } _{\\mathrm {stem} }+\\mathrm {ending} } _{\\mathrm {word} }}\nThe process of forming a lexical stem from a root is known in general as derivational morphology, while the process of inflecting that stem is known as inflectional morphology. As in other languages, the possible suffixes that can be added to a given root, and the meaning that results, are not entirely predictable, while the process of inflection is largely predictable in both form and meaning.\nOriginally, extensive ablaut (vowel variation, between *e, *o, *\u0113, *\u014d and \u00d8, i.e. no vowel) occurred in PIE, in both derivation and inflection and in the root, suffix, and ending. Variation in the position of the accent likewise occurred in both derivation and inflection, and is often considered part of the ablaut system (which is described in more detail below).\nFor example, the nominative form *l\u00e9ymons 'lake' (composed of the root *ley- in the ablaut form *l\u00e9y-, the suffix in the form *-mon- and the ending in the form *-s) had the genitive *limn\u00e9s (root form *li-, suffix *-mn- and ending *-\u00e9s). In this word, the nominative has the ablaut vowels *\u00e9\u2013o\u2013\u00d8 while the genitive has the ablaut vowels *\u00d8\u2013\u00d8\u2013\u00e9 \u2014 i.e. all three components have different ablaut vowels, and the stress position has also moved.\nA large number of different patterns of ablaut variation existed; speakers had to both learn the ablaut patterns and memorize which pattern went with which word. There was a certain regularity of which patterns occurred with which suffixes and formations, but with many exceptions.Already by late PIE times, this system was extensively simplified, and daughter languages show a steady trend towards more and more regularization and simplification.\nFar more simplification occurred in the late PIE nominal system than in the verbal system, where the original PIE ablaut variations were maintained essentially intact well into the recorded history of conservative daughter languages such as Sanskrit and Ancient Greek, as well as in the Germanic languages (in the form of strong verbs)."

        "content": "Following the multi-platinum and award-winning success of her eponymous debut album in 2006, Bailey Rae began to work on songs for a follow-up album in late 2007. However, she took a hiatus from music, following the death of her husband, Scottish saxophonist Jason Rae, in March 2008 to an accidental overdose of methadone and alcohol. For a long period of time, Bailey Rae said, \"I didn't really hear any songs. Normally in my everyday life, I'd be in the car and come up with a little line, or I'd look at something and try to describe it ... I didn't really think in that way anymore. Nothing was coming in.\" After months of grief and isolation, Bailey Rae revisited her work the following year and composed additional material for The Sea.\nThe Sea contains songs written before and after the death of Bailey Rae's husband, all of which she said resonated with her: \"The circumstances have cast it all in a different light. It began as a 'before and after' record, but it's become an 'after' record.\" The ballad \"I'd Do It All Again\" was written by Bailey Rae in January 2008 after an argument with her husband. She told NME that writing the rest of the album helped her handle the different emotions she felt after her husband's death: \"When I started writing that I was thinking, 'I don't really want this song to go into the world, 'cause it's so naked...' But I had to.\" \"I Would Like to Call it Beauty\", she said, was written about finding beauty in the \"darkest times\", later telling journalist Sean O'Hagan:\n\nThere is something miraculous that pushes you along, makes you keep going, makes you carry on. It's really about the mystery of that. In fact, the whole album is about that in a way; it's about loss but it's also about hope, about keeping going and trying to find that beauty.\nBailey Rae recorded most of The Sea in 2009 at Manchester's Limefield Studio. She co-produced the record mostly with Steve Brown and Steve Chrisanthou, both of whom had worked on her debut album. Bailey Rae pursued a sound more aggressive than on her debut. During the recording process, Bailey Rae listened to Sly and the Family Stone's 1973 album Fresh and Curtis Mayfield's 1975 album There's No Place Like America Today, as well as the music of Nina Simone and Leonard Cohen. A live band was used in the album's recording, which was also a departure from her debut. \"On the first album, it was me and a producer in a basement going through hundreds of snare drum sounds to find the right one,\" she recalled. \"With a live band, you can stretch out more and try new things out without feeling you're having to undo this meticulously built-up track.\"The album was titled after the recurring theme of water in songs such as \"Diving for Hearts\" and \"I Would Like to Call It Beauty\", while the music was said by Bailey Rae to possess \"a kind of tidal movement to it too, in the way that we recorded the songs. You know, sometimes it would just be me and my guitar. Then we'd really sort of swell up into these big arrangements, only to then retreat back to it just being me and my guitar again.\" According to Chris Mugan from The Independent, The Sea was a departure from the polished sound of Bailey Rae's debut album, while Paste magazine's Steve Labate said Bailey Rae expanded on her debut's mix of contemporary R&B and older soul music by incorporating pop rock, singer-songwriter influences, and occasional elements of bossa nova and trip hop. In the opinion of Craig McLean from The Daily Telegraph, the record's music evoked Simone's singing and the 1968 Van Morrison album Astral Weeks."

AllMusic's David Jeffries called it \"a testament to Rae's artistic growth\", while Steve Leftridge of PopMatters found the album \"richer\" than her debut, with a \"darker and more sophisticated sonic palette\".

The Observer's Graeme Thompson felt the album's strong points offer \"glimpses of a new horizon shining beyond the riptides of pain and sorrow\", but at times it sounds \"dull and flat\". Slant Magazine's Nick Day was more critical, finding the music forgettable and the lyrics introspective but vague. Hot Press journalist Patrick Freyne believed the music exhibits an \"excessive tastefulness\" while panning the contributions of the session musicians, whom he said were \"technically proficient\" but sounded soulless.In late 2010, The Sea was named the year's best album by The Guardian's Caroline Sullivan, while Powers ranked it ninth on her year-end list of 2010's best albums. Q and Uncut included the album on their respective year-end lists at numbers 22 and 37.

On 25 February\u2014lead guitarist George Harrison's 21st birthday\u2014the band were back at London's EMI Studios, recording John Lennon's \"You Can't Do That\" for release as the B-side of \"Can't Buy Me Love\". The band also attempted \"And I Love Her\" and \"I Should Have Known Better\" on this day and again the following day, with the former finalised on 27 February. Two more songs from the film, \"Tell Me Why\" and \"If I Fell\", were recorded on this day.On 1 March 1964, the Beatles recorded three songs in three hours: \"I'm Happy Just to Dance with You\" for the film, featuring Harrison on lead vocal; a cover of Little Richard's \"Long Tall Sally\"; and Lennon's \"I Call Your Name\", which was originally given to Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas the previous year. Mono and stereo mixing was carried out over the following two weeks. The \"Can't Buy Me Love\" / \"You Can't Do That\" single was released on 16 March and topped charts worldwide. Taking a break for filming, drummer Ringo Starr coined the phrase \"a hard day's night\", providing the film with its title. Lennon and McCartney wrote a song based on the title, which was recorded at EMI on 16 April and mixed four days later.On 1 June, with the film completed and the band returning from holidays, the Beatles returned to EMI, recording the remaining songs for the tie-in LP, with outtakes appearing on the Long Tall Sally EP. Covers of Carl Perkins' \"Matchbox\", with Starr on lead vocals, and Larry Williams' \"Slow Down\", appeared on the EP, while Lennon's \"I'll Cry Instead\" and \"I'll Be Back\" appeared on the LP. The following day on 2 June, the band completed Lennon's \"Any Time at All\" and \"When I Get Home\", and McCartney's \"Things We Said Today\". The band spent the remainder of June and July touring internationally."

        "content": "Musically, A Hard Day's Night eschews the rock and roll cover songs of the band's previous albums for a predominantly pop sound. Sputnikmusic's Dave Donnelly observes \"short, peppy\" pop songs characterised by layered vocals, immediate choruses, and understated instrumentation. According to Pitchfork's Tom Ewing, the lack of rock and roll covers allows listeners to \"take the group's new sound purely on its own modernist terms\", with audacious \"chord choices\", powerful harmonies, \"gleaming\" guitar, and \"Northern\" harmonica. Music journalist Robert Christgau writes that Lennon\u2013McCartney's songs were \"more sophisticated musically\" than before. It also features Harrison playing a Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar, a sound that was influential on the Byrds and other bands in the folk rock explosion of 1965.Side one of the LP contains the songs from the film soundtrack. Side two contains songs written for, but not included in, the film, although a 1980s re-release of the film includes a prologue before the opening credits with \"I'll Cry Instead\" on the soundtrack. The title of the album and film was the accidental creation of Starr. According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine: \"I was going home in the car and [film director] Dick Lester suggested the title, 'Hard Day's Night' from something Ringo had said. I had used it in In His Own Write, but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those malapropisms. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny ... just said it. So Dick Lester said, 'We are going to use that title.'\"A Hard Day's Night is the first Beatles album to feature entirely original compositions, and the only one where all the songs were written by Lennon\u2013McCartney. Lennon is the primary author of nine of the thirteen tracks on the album, as well as being the lead singer on these same nine tracks (although Paul McCartney sings lead on the title track's middle-eight). Lennon and McCartney co-wrote \"I'm Happy Just to Dance with You\", sung by Harrison, while McCartney wrote \"And I Love Her\", \"Can't Buy Me Love\" and \"Things We Said Today\". It is one of three Beatles albums, along with Let It Be and Magical Mystery Tour, in which Starr does not sing lead vocal on any songs. (Starr sang the lead vocal on \"Matchbox\" during the sessions; it appeared instead on the Long Tall Sally EP.) It is also one of three Beatles albums, along with Please Please Me and Beatles for Sale, in which Harrison does not contribute to the songwriting."

        "content": "According to music critic Richie Unterberger, writing for AllMusic:\n\nGeorge Harrison's resonant 12-string electric guitar leads [on A Hard's Day's Night] were hugely influential; the movie helped persuade the Byrds, then folksingers, to plunge all out into rock & roll, and the Beatles would be hugely influential on the folk-rock explosion of 1965. The Beatles' success, too, had begun to open the US market for fellow English bands like the Rolling Stones, the Animals, and the Kinks, and inspired young American groups like the Beau Brummels, Lovin' Spoonful, and others to mount a challenge of their own with self-penned material that owed a great debt to Lennon\u2013McCartney.\nIn his book Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!: The Story of Pop Music from Bill Haley to Beyonc\u00e9, Bob Stanley identifies A Hard Day's Night as the album that best captures the band's early-career appeal. He writes:\n\nIf you had to explain the Beatles' impact to a stranger, you'd play them the soundtrack to A Hard Day's Night. The songs, conceived in a hotel room in a spare couple of weeks between up-ending the British class system and conquering America, were full of bite and speed. There was adventure, knowingness, love, and abundant charm.\nA Hard Day's Night was included in the list of \"100 Essential Rock Albums\" compiled by musicologists Charlie Gillett and Simon Frith for ZigZag magazine in 1975, and is one of the \"Treasure Island albums\" featured in Greil Marcus's 1979 book Stranded. In 2000, Q magazine placed A Hard Day's Night at number 5 on its list \"The 100 Greatest British Albums Ever\". That same year, it appeared at number 22 in Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked it 307th on the magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In the 2020 revision, it rose to number 263.A Hard Day's Night has also appeared in critics' lists of the best albums of all time published by the NME, in 1974 (at number 33), 1985 (number 73) and 2013 (number 195); Mojo, in 1995 (number 81); and Uncut, in 2016 (number 149). It was a featured album in The Mojo Collection: The Greatest Albums of All Time, Tom Moon's book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die and Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, and was selected as one of the \"Most Significant Rock Albums\" in the Greenwood Encyclopedia of Rock History."

The album went to number one on the Billboard album chart, spending 14 weeks there, the longest run of any album that year. United Artists rushed the album into stores over a month before the film's US premiere; as a result, the Beatles had both the number-one album and number-one single in the country when A Hard Day's Night opened on 11 August 1964.\nAll seven songs from the film, the first side of the UK album, were featured along with \"I'll Cry Instead\", which, although written for the film, was cut at the last minute. The American version also included four orchestral instrumental versions of Lennon and McCartney songs arranged by George Martin conducting an orchestra of studio musicians: \"I Should Have Known Better\", \"And I Love Her\", \"Ringo's Theme\", and \"A Hard Day's Night\". After EMI acquired United Artists Records, this album was reissued in August 1980 on the Capitol label, catalogue SW-11921.\nWhile the stereo version of the album included the instrumental tracks in true stereo, the Beatles' own recordings appeared as electronically rechannelled stereo recordings made from the mono releases. The 1980 Capitol Records reissue used the same master tape as the original United Artists LP release in fake stereo, despite the availability of several tracks with official true stereo remixes. True stereo versions of most of the songs had been issued on the Capitol album Something New, released in July 1964. \"Can't Buy Me Love\" and \"I Should Have Known Better\" finally appeared in stereo on the 1970 Apple Records compilation Hey Jude. The song \"A Hard Day's Night\" did not appear in true stereo in the US until the 1982 Capitol compilation album Reel Music. In 2014, the American version of the \"A Hard Day's Night\" album was released on CD individually and in a boxed set of all the other US Beatles albums to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Beatles first US visit. This CD reissue features all of the songs in both true stereo and mono mixes.\nIn 2000, the 1964 North American release of A Hard Day's Night by The Beatles on the United Artists label was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame."

They had first met Stephen Street on the session for \"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\" and requested his contact number. Officially, the record's production is credited to \"The Smiths\".\nTo build the album's soundscape, Morrissey provided Marr and Street with his personal copies of BBC sound effects records from which to source samples. Morrissey would continue this practice on future Smiths singles and albums.\nMeat Is Murder was more strident and political than its predecessor, including the pro-vegetarian title track (Morrissey forbade the rest of the band from being photographed eating meat), and the anti-corporal punishment \"The Headmaster Ritual\". Musically, the band had grown more adventurous, with Marr and Rourke channelling rockabilly and funk influences in \"Rusholme Ruffians\" and \"Barbarism Begins at Home\", respectively. \"Rusholme Ruffians\" interpolates the Victoria Wood song \"Fourteen Again\". Author John King has suggested that the title track was inspired by the 1983 song \"Meat Means Murder\" by the anarcho-punk band Conflict, which deals with the same topic and also opens at a slow pace.Morrissey also brought a political stance to many of his interviews. Among his targets were the Thatcher administration, the monarchy, and his musical contemporaries. When asked about Band Aid, which was being strongly promoted in the UK media at the time, he quipped, \"One can have great concern for the people of Ethiopia, but it's another thing to inflict daily torture on the people of England\". Similarly, he began to promote vegetarianism in live shows and interviews, on one occasion convincing a Scottish TV show to air footage of slaughterhouses during the dinner hour."

Dan Lilker stated, \"The lyrics were never intended to be serious, just to piss people off.\"While the album raised no eyebrows at the time for its tongue-in-cheek yet topical content, later generations began to further scrutinize the lyrics. In an interview with Songfacts in 2014, when asked \"If Speak English or Die came out today, do you think that because of the political correctness of today, it would go over the same?\", Lilker responded, \"It probably would have had a harder time just because people seem to be more uptight now. Nevertheless, it was what it was, which is saying it is what it is, but back then. And I don't regret it. Maybe minor aspects went overboard with certain lyrical things, but then again, we didn't really mean them. Perhaps if people realize that, then it's just more funny.\""

        "content": "Racine carr\u00e9e (French for 'square root', stylised as \u221a) is the second studio album by Belgian musician Stromae. It was released digitally on 16 August 2013 and three days later physically in France and Belgium.\nStromae expressed his desire to incorporate Caribbean and African musical influences along with his signature 1990s-inspired dance beats. The album, recorded in an attic, explores themes as diverse as alienation from social networks, relationship issues, discrimination, cigarettes and lung cancer, AIDS and absent father figures. Prior to its official release and afterwards, Racine carr\u00e9e received critical acclaim for its thoughtful lyrics and gained comparisons to fellow Belgian recording artist Jacques Brel.\nThe album was a commercial success across Western Europe, including non-francophone countries. Racine carr\u00e9e topped the charts in France, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Italy, as well as reaching the top ten in Canada, and the top forty in Germany. In his native Belgium, it remained at the top the charts for multiple weeks and been certified twelve times platinum by the BEA. In France, the album has been certified quadruple diamond by the SNEP and become one of the highest-selling albums in recent years after amassing over one million copies sold four months after its release. Racine carr\u00e9e yielded three chart-topping singles: \"Papaoutai\", \"Formidable\" and \"Tous les m\u00eames\"."

The opening week numbers were higher than the 75,000 copies his previous album, Cheese, had sold since its release. The following week, the album sold 50,901 copies but was replaced at the top of the chart by the second volume of tribute album G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Goldman, which sold 59,274 units. By the end of September and after only six weeks of release, Racine carr\u00e9e had crossed the 300,000 mark and spent five non-consecutive weeks at number one. In the last week of October, the album surpassed Daft Punk's Random Access Memories as the best selling album of 2013; up to that point the former had sold 475,500 copies while the latter had amassed 469,700 units. In its eighteenth week on the chart, just before Christmas, Racine carr\u00e9e remained at number one for a sixteenth non-consecutive week at the top with its biggest weekly sales and the second-best weekly score of 2013, 182,034 units, just behind the 195,013 copies Random Access Memories sold in its first week of availability. This allowed it to cross the million mark in just four months; the last album to sell over one million copies was Adele's 21 (2011), which took eleven months.In francophone Europe, Racine carr\u00e9e also experienced massive success. In his native Belgium, Stromae's second album opened at number one in both Flanders and Wallonia. In the former, Racine carr\u00e9e spent 17 non-consecutive weeks at number one; while in the latter, it remained at the top for 26 non-consecutive weeks. In late December, the album was certified seven times platinum by the Belgian Entertainment Association, denoting shipments of over 140,000 copies in the country. Additionally, Racine carr\u00e9e finished the year as the best-selling album in both Flanders and Wallonia. In Switzerland, the album also debuted at number one and held the top spot for four additional weeks. In French-speaking Romandie, the album spent fourteen non-consecutive weeks at number one and remained in the top three for several weeks after its release in late August. In addition, Racine carr\u00e9e has been certified 5\u00d7 platinum by the Swiss branch of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, denoting shipments of 75,000 units. In Canada, the album debuted within the top ten and remained in the chart for only three weeks.Success was not limited to francophone countries; the album also sold well in Germany and the Netherlands. In Germany, Racine carr\u00e9e debuted just outside the top twenty in the main albums chart and at the top of the digital albums chart. In the Netherlands, the album debuted at number sixteen; the following week it climbed five positions to reach number eleven, its highest chart rank up to that point. After falling below the top forty and reaching positions as low as fifty-seven for two weeks, it eventually rebounded and entered the top ten for the first time in mid-December. The album later peaked within the top three. According to MegaCharts, the album finished the year as the fifty-eighth highest-selling album in the Netherlands.\nIn Austria, the album did not reach the chart but sold constantly in the lower sales regions, eventually reaching gold."

        "content": "Racine carr\u00e9e produced six singles:\n\n\"Papaoutai\" was released as the lead single in mid-May 2013. The autobiographical song tells the story of a young boy who is looking for his father. Stromae revealed that his father was killed during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The music video shows him adopting the style and pose of a 1940s mannequin, representing the absent father and the young version of him trying to interact with the mannequin. The single became an instant hit in France and Wallonia, where it spent multiple weeks at number one; it also reached the top ten in Switzerland and Luxembourg as well as non-francophone countries or regions such as the Czech Republic, Dutch-speaking Flanders in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.\n\"Formidable\" was released as the follow-up single to \"Papaoutai\" in June 2013. The music video, filmed in the streets of Brussels, was particularly notorious for displaying Stromae wandering at the Louise/Louiza tram and metro station during the daybreak, where the singer appears to be completely drunk. The song tells the story of a drunk man recently separated from his girlfriend. It eventually topped the charts in France and the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking regions of Belgium, reached the top five in the Netherlands, the top twenty in Switzerland and the top forty in Austria and Germany.\n\"Tous les m\u00eames\" was officially released as the third single from the album in December 2013. The song displays the various stereotypical traits and behaviours of men and women alike. The music video for the single shows Stromae half-dressed as a woman and acting annoyed by the attitude of men and what they do; to further aid the interpretation, green lighting effects are used for male Stromae and pink ones for female Stromae. The single became Stromae's third consecutive number one from Racine carr\u00e9e in France and Wallonia, while reaching the top five in Flanders and charting in the Netherlands and Switzerland.\n\"Ta f\u00eate\" was released on 3 February 2014. The track served as the anthem for the Belgium national football team during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\n\"Ave Cesaria\" was released on 21 July 2014. The track honours Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora, one of Stromae's favourite artists who died in 2011.\n\"Carmen\" was released on 20 March 2015. The track was inspired by L'amour est un oiseau rebelle, an aria from the 1875 opera Carmen by Georges Bizet, hence the song's title.\n\"Quand c'est?\" was released on 14 September 2015. A song about cancer and how it affected his father & mother."

By this point, John Entwistle had released Smash Your Head Against the Wall (with Moon playing percussion and singing backing vocals), Roger Daltrey released his hit album Daltrey (1973), and Pete Townshend had produced several Meher Baba tribute albums and the demo compilation Who Came First (1972).\nMoon had moved into the Beverly Wilshire Hotel with assistant Dougal Butler in March 1974, to play on the sessions for Harry Nilsson's Pussy Cats. The album was produced by John Lennon. Lennon and Nilsson had been ejected from the Troubadour for drunkenly heckling a Smothers Brothers performance several days before Moon's arrival. The three, along with Ringo Starr (who also drummed on Pussy Cats), Lennon's girlfriend May Pang, bassist Klaus Voormann, Voormann's girlfriend Cynthia Webb, and Starr's manager Hilary Gerrard, moved together into a Santa Monica beach house for three weeks. The sessions were affected by Lennon, Nilsson, Moon and Starr's excessive lifestyles and drug abuse, ultimately prompting Lennon to relocate the sessions to New York City.\nAt the time of Moon's arrival, Lennon had made initial recordings for Rock 'n' Roll (1975) with Phil Spector, and David Bowie and Bryan Ferry had also released cover albums; Bowie's Pin Ups (1973) notably included two songs by the Who, \"I Can't Explain\" and \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\". Encountering the Beatles' former road manager Mal Evans on the Sunset Strip, Moon suggested that Evans produce a solo album for him."

        "title": "Two Sides of the Moon_p1",
        "content": "The first song, a cover version of the Beach Boys' \"Don't Worry Baby\", was recorded in late March at the Record Plant Studios. The musicians included John Sebastian, Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, Jesse Ed Davis, and Miguel Ferrer playing drums. Kaylan described the album as \"a fantasy record for him\", allowing him to live out his fantasy to \"be a Beach Boy\". For this reason, Moon largely avoided playing the drums, as he considered drumming his \"job\". Moon left Los Angeles on 19 April to begin filming Tommy, and after the filming concluded, unofficially relocated to California in August 1974, to work on the studio album.The album would be funded by a recording contract directly with Los Angeles' MCA Records arranged by Bill Curbishley and Peter Rudge. Funding was unavailable from London due to Track Records' legal problems with former Who managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, and Moon's extravagant spending habits made labels reluctant to fund the sessions. Biographer Tony Fletcher expresses astonishment that MCA approved the album's recording and released the \"travesty of a Beach Boys cover\" as a single rather than rejecting the master tapes for \"Don't Worry Baby\".The sessions for Two Sides of the Moon were affected by the \"lazy and decadent self-indulgence\" of mid-1970s Los Angeles' \"superstar scene\". Inconsistent working hours and substance abuse slowed down the sessions considerably. The atmosphere of the studio resembled that of a club. Engineer Gary Ladinsky recalled: \"You'd get something done for an hour, and then it's a party scene. Eventually, you clear out the studio and you might do something for another half an hour, and then people wander out, and you realise, 'I guess the session is over.'\"After \"Teenage Idol\", with Dick Dale guesting on guitar, was delivered to MCA, Evans was fired. Fletcher attributes this to Moon's realisation that the sessions were largely fruitless and Evans' own drinking problem was worsening. Skip Taylor replaced him as producer. Volman and engineer John Stronach described Taylor as the main provider of drugs for the sessions. Taylor did not dispute the assessment: \"I would go in and decide, is this a night where we should have a little brandy, or should we smoke some stuff, or should we put a couple of lines out?\"Most of the musicians involved saw no real difference as a result of the change. Kaylan commented that after recording his parts twice, \"Basically it was the same record.\" Joe Walsh, then recording So What with Stronach at the Record Plant, was brought in to play additional guitar on \"The Kids Are Alright\" late in the sessions. He described the results as \"semi-train wrecks\" and expressed surprise that Moon had only used two producers since he would \"fry\" anyone who worked with him.Moon's contributions to the album were primarily vocals. He only played drums on three songs, simultaneously accompanied by session drummers. Stronach said that the sessions had two drummers: \"One to keep time and then Keith to play over it.\" The first set of vocals recorded with Evans, done while Moon was drunk, was discarded. Taylor characterised them as \"a guy from England trying to sound like a guy from Nashville but having about five belts before he did it.\" Taylor demanded that Moon abandon the country twang in which he had sung the early songs (and which is noticeable on outtakes such as \"I'm Not Angry\"), and sing in the posh British accent he regularly mimicked.Fletcher comments that so many musicians were brought in to try to \"salvage\" the record (sixty being credited on the final album, with several others such as Brian Wilson having been rumoured to have contributed as well) that it resulted in Moon sounding more like \"the guest on someone else's record\".Moon's behaviour during the sessions reflected his self-destructive lifestyle and worsening health. Stronach recalled, \"He'd come in, reach into his pockets, and there'd be pills and cocaine falling out.\" Moon had previously been able to sing adequately on several songs from the A Quick One (1966), Ready Steady Who (1966), The Who Sell Out (1967) and Quadrophenia (1973) sessions. His strained and frequently off-key vocals on Two Sides of the Moon contributed to feelings of inadequacy and depression throughout recording. Recording vocals one night in Studio B under a low ceiling covered in spotlights, he smashed a light bulb with an ashtray every time recording was stopped because he failed to hit a note. He ended up destroying the entire light fixture.MCA's then-president Mike Maitland told Taylor at their first meeting that a lot of money had been invested before he assumed production duties, and that MCA was \"prepared to spend an enormous sum of money in promotion and marketing\". This was exactly what happened: Fletcher states that \"well over $200,000\" was spent for \"recording costs alone\", and that Moon claimed to receive a non-returnable advance for the same amount.With the album being prepared for release in 1975, MCA initially refused to pay for the elaborate sleeve designed by Gary Stromberg. Moon, Taylor and Stronach went to meet with Maitland. Moon asked Taylor to stop in front of an Army and Navy store on the way, and returned with a fire axe, which he kept hidden on himself. Maitland once again denied their sleeve request, criticising them for the excessive cost of the album. Moon responded by placing himself directly in front of Maitland and held the fire axe above Maitland's mahogany partners desk, and said, \"What's it going to be, dear boy? My album cover or a new desk?\""

        "content": "Yellow Submarine is the tenth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles, released in January 1969. It is the soundtrack to the animated film of the same name, which premiered in London in July 1968. The album contains six songs by the Beatles, including four new songs and the previously released \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"All You Need Is Love\". The remainder of the album is a re-recording of the film's orchestral soundtrack by the band's producer, George Martin.\nThe project was regarded as a contractual obligation by the Beatles, who were asked to supply four new songs for the film. Some were written and recorded specifically for the soundtrack, while others were unreleased tracks from other projects. The album was recorded before \u2013 and issued two months after \u2013 the band's self-titled double LP (also known as the \"White Album\") and was not viewed by the band as a significant release. An EP containing only the new songs had been considered, and was mastered, but left unreleased. The original mono mixes were later included in the 2009 compilation Mono Masters.\nYellow Submarine reached the top 5 in the UK and the US. It has since been afforded a mixed reception from music critics, some of whom consider that it falls short of the high standard generally associated with the Beatles' work. Another version of the album, Yellow Submarine Songtrack, was issued on the film's 30th anniversary. It dispenses with the George Martin orchestral works, and includes the six Beatles songs from the original album, along with an additional nine songs heard in the film, all newly remixed."

Having recently completed their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in April 1967, the group showed minimal enthusiasm for the project. Along with the music for their Magical Mystery Tour TV film, the Yellow Submarine soundtrack was part of a period that author Ian MacDonald later described as the band's \"regime of continuous low-intensity recording ...it had a workaday quality about it \u2013 an intrinsic lack of tension which was bound to colour the resulting material.\""

After viewing the finished film, the Beatles were much more enthusiastic and did more to associate themselves with it after its release. Having been delayed so that it would not clash with the release of The Beatles, and to allow for the re-recording of Martin's contributions, Yellow Submarine was issued by Apple Records on 13 January 1969 in the U.S. and on 17 January in the UK. The album was issued in stereo only in the U.S., while the UK album was available in both stereo and mono, although the mono version is simply a fold-down (a combination of two stereo channels into one mono) rather than a specific mix.\nSince \"All You Need Is Love\" had been rush-released as a single, it did not have an official stereo mix. Although the track was released on the U.S. LP Magical Mystery Tour, an official stereo mix of the track was not made until 29 October 1968 for the album. In the U.S., 8-track tape and cassette tape versions included \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", which was also heard in the film, as an additional song.In contrast to the animated film, Yellow Submarine was not generally considered to be a significant release. Issued two months after The Beatles, it was one of the few Beatles releases that failed to top the charts in either the United Kingdom or the United States, peaking instead at number 3 and number 2, respectively. In Canada, Yellow Submarine topped the RPM national albums chart for two weeks, ending the White Album's 12-week run at number 1.

Beat Instrumental bemoaned the paucity of new material by the band, but added: \"be not of bad cheer. The George Martin score to the film is really very nice, and two tracks by George Harrison redeem the first side. Both [songs] are superb pieces, considerably more enthralling than the most draggy All Together Now, a rather wet track.\" In a review for International Times, Barry Miles considered Martin's score \"superbly produced\" and, of the songs, wrote only of \"It's All Too Much\", which he described as, variously, \"Endless, mantric, a round, interwoven, trellised, tessellated, filigreed, gidouiled, spiralling\" and \"Happy singalong music\". Record Mirror's reviewer said that, given the longstanding demand for a soundtrack album, the release of Yellow Submarine would evoke \"the ecstasy of fans the world over\". The reviewer added that the four new Beatles songs matched the quality of the two \"excellent\" hit singles, and Martin's side represented a \"tremendous achievement\" that also justified any complaints about the price. Writing in their 1975 book The Beatles: An Illustrated Record, NME critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler bemoaned the commercial considerations that had resulted in the release of a full soundtrack album, saying that the four new tracks \"would have made a superb EP\".More recently, AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger has written of Yellow Submarine: \"The album would have been far better value if it had been released as a four-song EP...with the addition of a bonus track in \"Across the Universe\"...No one would argue that there's a huge amount more than meets the eye (or ear) there, but listening to the original album anew 40 years on, one is still struck by how mostly second-rate, and recycled and rejected Beatles material still sounds so good.\" Writing for Pitchfork Media, Mark Richardson opines that \"the Yellow Submarine soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn't really be bothered\" and describes \"Hey Bulldog\" as \"a tough and funky piano-driven rocker, [and] by a good margin the best song here\". Richardson concludes: \"But as an album it's ultimately forgettable, which is something the Beatles so rarely were otherwise.\"PopMatters' David Gassman views Martin's selections as \"kind of twee and inconsequential\" and the four new songs on side one as \"fascinating\", adding that \"The material's tossed-off origins give it a character unlike any other Beatles album.\" While noting that the soundtrack was superseded with the 1999 release of Yellow Submarine Songtrack, Gassman writes: \"No matter how you get them, though, the otherwise unavailable songs on this album ought to be part of any thinking Beatles fan's collection.\" Alex Young of Consequence of Sound writes: \"as a whole, Yellow Submarine is a delightful album, even if it's still a less-than-acceptable inclusion in the Beatles canon\", though he criticised the inclusion of Martin's score, which he felt should have been sold as a separate release."

        "content": "\"Oye C\u00f3mo Va\" is a 1962 cha-cha-ch\u00e1 by Tito Puente, originally released on El Rey Bravo (Tico Records). The song achieved worldwide popularity in 1970, when it was recorded by American rock group Santana for their album Abraxas. This version was released as a single in 1971, reaching number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 11 on the Billboard Easy Listening survey, and number 32 on the R&B chart. The block chord ostinato pattern that repeats throughout the song was most likely borrowed by Puente from Cachao's 1957 mambo \"Chanchullo\", which was recorded by Puente in 1959.The song has been praised by critics and inducted into the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001 and the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002. Due to its multinational origins\u2014Cuban, Puerto Rican and American\u2014and its many versions by artists from all over the world, \"Oye c\u00f3mo va\" has come to represent \"the interconnectedness, hybridity and transnationality\" of Latin music in the United States."

        "content": "\"Oye c\u00f3mo va\" was written and recorded by Tito Puente and his orchestra in 1962 for Tico Records. The name of the song is taken from its refrain: \"Oye c\u00f3mo va, mi ritmo...\" (Listen how it goes, my rhythm). The song was arranged as a cha-cha-ch\u00e1 with a repeated piano tumbao consisting of block chords and a vocal refrain sung by a chorus, typical of cha-cha-ch\u00e1. The song's introduction and piano vamp which are highly similar to the 1957 mambo \"Chanchullo\" by Israel \"Cachao\" L\u00f3pez. According to Max Salazar, it is likely that Puente was inspired by Cachao's tune when composing \"Oye c\u00f3mo va\", given the clear similarities. In fact, Puente recorded the song in 1959 for his album Mucho cha cha (RCA Victor). The second section of the song resembles the introduction to \"Te ense\u00f1ar\u00e9\", written by Sergio Calzado and recorded by Estrellas Cubanas in 1960. Sergio Calzado's brother, Rudy, is the lead singer in Puente's recording.\nPuente himself recorded \"Oye c\u00f3mo va\" live on many occasions, including his 1980 Montreux Jazz Festival appearance with the Latin Percussion Jazz Ensemble.\nThe lineup in the original recording was the following:\nTito Puente: timbales, chorus, leader\nJimmy Frisaura: trumpet\nPedro \"Puchi\" Boulong: trumpet\nPat Russo: trumpet\nBarry Rogers: trombone\nShep Pullman: baritone saxophone\nRafael \"Tata\" Palau: tenor saxophone\nJes\u00fas Caunedo: tenor saxophone\nAl Abreu: tenor saxophone\nPete Fanelli: alto saxophone\nJohnny Pacheco: flute\nGil L\u00f3pez: piano\nPupi Legarreta: violin\nBobby Rodr\u00edguez: bass\nJuan \"Papi\" Cadavieco: congas\nJos\u00e9 Mangual Sr.: bongos\nSantos Col\u00f3n: vocals\nRudy Calzado: vocals\nYayo el Indio: chorus\nChirivico D\u00e1vila: chorus"

        "content": "Santana's arrangement is a \"driving, cranked-up version\" in a new style of Latin rock, adding electric guitar, Hammond B-3 organ, and a rock drum kit to the instrumentation and dropping Puente's brass section. The electric guitar part takes on Puente's flute melody, and the organ provides accompaniment (with organist Gregg Rolie's discreet use of the Leslie effect). There are several guitar solos and an organ solo, all of which are rooted in rock and the blues but also contain licks similar to those of the original arrangement.Tito Puente, speaking in the intro to his recording of \"Oye c\u00f3mo va\" on the album Mambo Birdland, said \"Everybody's heard of Santana. Santana! Beautiful Santana! He put our music, Latin rock, around the world, man! And I'd like to thank him publicly 'cause he recorded a tune and he gave me credit as the composer of the tune. So, since that day... all we play... is Santana music!\" The version of the song on Mambo Birdland is a Santana-sized version. When interviewed, Puente explained how he was initially outraged by his song being covered by a rock band, until he received his first royalty check.Santana's version was inducted into the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001 and the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002. It was also included in the NPR 100 list, \"the most important American musical works of the 20th century\". In 2021, it was ranked No. 479 on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".Santana's recording was sampled by 2 Live Crew on the song \"Mamolapenga\" from their 1990 album Banned in the U.S.A.."

The book is written in Old Turkic using the Old Turkic script (also known as \"Orkhon\" or \"Turkic runes\"); it is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script. It is also an important source for early Turkic mythology."

        "content": "The only extant version of the Irk Bitig is a manuscript from the Dunhuang Library Cave that is now held at the British Library (shelfmark Or.8212/161).\nThe manuscript is in the form of a booklet comprising 58 folios folded in half, each page being about 13.1 \u00d7 8.1 cm in size. The pages of the booklet turn to the right (opposite to that of Western books), and the Old Turkic text is laid out in horizontal right-to-left lines running top-to-bottom down the page. The text of Irk Bitig consists of 104 pages in 52 folios (folios 5b\u201357a), with 40\u201370 characters per page. The text is written in black ink with red punctuation marks marking word division, except for the colophon on the last two pages, which is written in red ink. The first four and a half folios (including one line overwriting the start of the Old Turkic text) and the last three folios (of which one and a half folios overwrite the Old Turkic colophon) are Buddhist devotional verses written in Chinese. As the Chinese text overwrites the beginning and end of the Old Turkic text, it is believed that the text of Irk Bitig was written first, and that the blank pages at the start and end of the booklet were later filled with the Chinese Buddhist verses.The title by which the book is known, Irk Bitig, meaning \"Book of Omens\", is given at the bottom of the last page of the main text (folio 55b), but the author is not mentioned anywhere.The manuscript text is not precisely dated, but its colophon states that it was written on the 15th day of the second month of the year of the tiger at the Tayg\u00fcntan (Chinese: \u5927\u96f2\u5802; pinyin: D\u00e0y\u00fant\u00e1ng) Manichaean monastery by an anonymous monk for his \"elder brother\", General \u0130ta\u00e7uk (Sa\u014bun \u0130ta\u00e7uk). As the Library Cave was sealed in the early 11th century, it is thought that this year of the tiger must be sometime during the 9th or 10th centuries. Louis Bazin suggests that the year of the tiger could here be 930 or 942, but Gerard Clauson and Talat Tekin both date the manuscript to the 9th century (i.e. one of the years 810, 822, 834, 846, 858, 870, 882 or 894).A number of transcription errors and textual omissions have been identified in the manuscript text, which suggest that it is not an original composition but a copy of an earlier text that was probably written in the Old Uyghur script. On the basis of its linguistic features, Marcel Erdal has dated the composition of the original work to the 8th and 9th centuries, among the earliest group of Old Turkic texts."

In particular, it uses the front vowel forms of the letter s \ud803\udc3e\u200e and n \ud803\udc24\u200e in certain situations where a back vowel form of the letters would be expected. The manuscript also uses two signs, \ud803\udc47\u200e (used to write the word ot meaning \"grass\") and \ud803\udc30\u200e (used to represent a syllabic up or the letter p after the letter u), that are not attested in other manuscript texts or inscriptions.The Old Turkic text does not have any sentence punctuation, but uses two black lines in a red circle as a word separation mark in order to indicate word boundaries."

        "content": "The main text of the book comprises 65 sections, each representing a particular divination, which is headed by three groups of between one and four circles filled with red ink. These three groups of circles are the omen (\u0131rk in Old Turkic) that are the subject of the divination, and are thought to represent the pips on a four-sided dice made from a rectangular piece of wood that would be thrown three times (or three such dice thrown once) as part of the divination ceremony. The groups of circles are followed by a short explanation of their meaning, such as \"I am a white-spotted falcon. I enjoy sitting on a sandal-wood tree\" (no.4), \"A man comes hurriedly. He comes bringing good tiding\" (no.7), and \"An old ox was eaten by ants, gnawing around its belly. It lays down without being able to move\" (no.37). After the explanation is a prognostication in the form \"Know thus, it is ...\" \"good\" (33 times), \"very good\" (7 times), \"bad\" (17 times) or \"very bad\" (2 times). In a few cases the prognostication after \"know thus\" is missing.There are 64 combinations of three groups of one to four pips, but the book gives a total of sixty-five omens, with some errors, including two missing omens (3-1-1 and 1-2-4) and some duplicate omens (3-4-1 occurs three times, and 3-1-3 occurs twice).\nThe omens comprise short stories about the world in which the nomadic Turkic people lived. Animals feature prominently in most of the omens, sometimes domesticated animals such as horse and camels, and sometimes wild animals such as tigers and deer. When wild animals fight each other or are injured the omen is bad (nos.6, 8, 37, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 61). Likewise, when domestic animals are mistreated, sick or stolen the omen is bad (nos. 16, 25, 39, 50, and 65). On the other hand, animals giving birth are good omens (nos. 5 and 41). A couple of the omens show a threefold pattern of parallelism between two animals and a human: a white mare, a she-camel and a princess give birth (no. 5); young birds, fawns, and children get lost in the fog (no.15).The Sky God Tengri is featured in some of the omens (no.12, 15, 17, 38, 41, 47, 54, 60), and he is normally shown to be benign, for instance rescuing lost or exhausted animals (nos. 15 and 17). Also featured is the god of the road, who bestows his favour on travellers (no.2), and mends old things and brings order to the country (no.48).The title Khan also features in several omens, establishing a royal camp (no.28), coming back from a victorious battle (no.34), and going hunting (no.63), which are all good omens. Omen 63 mentions the custom of the khan killing an animal with his own hands after it has been surrounded by his retinue.After the final divination, the book concludes, \"Now, my dear sons, know thus: this book of divination is good. Thus everyone is master of his own fate.\"The divination text is written in a mix of prose and poetry, and although it does not have a fixed poetic metre, it does exhibit poetic features such as stylistic parallelism, alliteration and rhyme."

The most important versions are the one in Robert Vaughan's Peniarth MS. 20 and the slightly less complete one in the Red Book of Hergest.

The entries for the earlier years are brief, usually records of deaths and events such as eclipses, plagues or earthquakes, but later entries are much more detailed. The main focus is on the rulers of the kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys and Deheubarth, but ecclesiastical events are also mentioned, such as the bringing of the date of celebrating Easter in the Welsh church into line with Rome by \"Elbodius\" (Elfodd), Bishop of Bangor, in 768. Events in England, Ireland, Scotland, Brittany and sometimes France are also briefly chronicled.\nThe original monastic annals are thought to have been written at Strata Florida Abbey, but may have been kept at the old abbey at Llanbadarn Fawr in the 11th century.

It also certified quadruple-platinum in Cyprus and gold status in Turkey. Additionally, the album was licensed to 35 territories.A re-release titled Gia & Ante Gia Collector's Edition was later released on 21 March 2002 and includes two discs featuring the songs from the original album plus the songs from the EP \"Ante Gia\".

The magazine became notorious for publishing graphic images of corpses, and using shocking headlines such as \"Raptola, violola y matola con una pistola\" (\"He kidnapped her, raped her and killed her with a gun\").\n\u00a1Alarma! got an unexpected boost in 1964, when it publicized the case of the Gonz\u00e1lez Valenzuela sisters, who forced women into prostitution, killed them, and repeatedly bribed authorities to avoid arrest. The case and the ensuing court process, covered by journalist Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nches Hermosillo, became a nationwide media circus.

It was also printed in countries such as the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Japan.

Island Records co-president Ted Cockle has emphasised that Lioness is not in any way the planned follow-up to Winehouse's album Back to Black (2006). In fact, only two songs intended for the planned follow-up had been completed prior to her death. The album is a compilation of recordings from before the release of Winehouse's debut studio album, Frank, in 2002, up to music she was working on in 2011.Producers Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson compiled the album with the consent of the Winehouse family. They worked together on listening to thousands of hours of vocals by Winehouse. Remi told NME that the album would not lead to \"a Tupac situation\", referring to Tupac Shakur, in whose name seven posthumous studio albums have been released since his death in 1996. He stated, \"A lot of people, through the other antics that were going on with her personally, didn't get that she was at the top of what she did. Coming to Miami was her escape from all of that, and her writing process could document her life, whether it was recording the pain or the loneliness or the humour. It makes no sense for these songs to be sitting on a hard drive, withering away.\"Two tracks from Lioness: Hidden Treasures received world exclusive plays on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra on 3 November 2011.

        "content": "According to Black Sabbath's guitarist and founding member Tony Iommi, the group's debut album was recorded in a single twelve-hour session on 16 October 1969. Iommi said: \"We just went in the studio and did it in a day, we played our live set and that was it. We actually thought a whole day was quite a long time, then off we went the next day to play for \u00a320 in Switzerland.\" Aside from the bells, thunder and rain sound effects added to the beginning of the opening track and the double-tracked guitar solos on \"N.I.B.\" and \"Sleeping Village\", there were virtually no overdubs added to the album. Iommi recalls recording live: \"We thought, 'We have two days to do it and one of the days is mixing.' So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time, we just put him in a separate booth and off we went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff.\"The key to the band's new sound on the album was Iommi's distinctive playing style that he developed after an accident at a sheet metal factory where he was working at the age of 17 in which the tips of the middle fingers of his fretting hand were severed. Iommi created a pair of false fingertips using plastic from a dish detergent bottle and tuned the strings on his guitar down to make it easier for him to bend the strings, creating a massive, heavy sound. \"I'd play a load of chords and I'd have to play fifths because I couldn't play fourths because of my fingers,\" Iommi explained to Phil Alexander in Mojo in 2013. \"That helped me develop my style of playing, bending the strings and hitting the open string at the same time just to make the sound wilder.\" In the same article bassist Geezer Butler added, \"Back then the bass player was supposed to do all these melodic runs, but I didn't know how to do that because I'd been a guitarist, so all I did was follow Tony's riff. That made the sound heavier.\"\nIommi began recording the album with a white Fender Stratocaster, his guitar of choice at the time, but a malfunctioning pickup forced him to finish recording with a Gibson SG, a guitar he had recently purchased as a backup but had \"never really played\". The SG was a right-handed model which the left-handed Iommi played upside down. Soon after recording the album, he met a right-handed guitarist who was playing a left-handed SG upside down, and the two agreed to swap guitars; this is the SG that Iommi modified and later \"put out to pasture\" at the Hard Rock Cafe.Black Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne has always spoken fondly of the recording of the band's debut album, stating in his autobiography I Am Ozzy, \"Once we'd finished, we spent a couple of hours double-tracking some of the guitar and vocals, and that was that. Done. We were in the pub in time for last orders. It can't have taken any longer than twelve hours in total. That's how albums should be made, in my opinion.\" Drummer Bill Ward agrees, telling Guitar World in 2001, \"I think the first album is just absolutely incredible. It's na\u00efve, and there's an absolute sense of unity \u2013 it's not contrived in any way, shape or form. We weren't old enough to be clever. I love it all, including the mistakes!\" In an interview for the Classic Albums series in 2010 Butler added, \"It was literally live in the studio. I mean, (producer) Rodger Bain, I think he's a genius the way he captured the band in such a short time.\" In his autobiography Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven & Hell with Black Sabbath, Iommi plays down the producer's role, insisting, \"We didn't choose to work with Rodger Bain, he was chosen for us... He was good to have around, but we didn't really get a lot of advice from him. He maybe suggested a couple of things, but the songs were already fairly structured and sorted.\""

In retrospect, AllMusic's Steve Huey feels that Black Sabbath marks \"the birth of heavy metal as we now know it\". In his opinion, the album \"transcends its clear roots in blues-rock and psychedelia to become something more\". He ascribes its \"sonic ugliness\" as a reflection of \"the bleak industrial nightmare\" of the group's hometown, Birmingham, England. Huey notes the first side's allusions to themes characteristic of heavy metal, including evil, paganism, and the occult, \"as filtered through horror films and the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien, H. P. Lovecraft, and Dennis Wheatley.\" He characterises side two as \"given over to loose blues-rock jamming learned through\" the English rock band Cream.In the opinion of the author and former Metal Maniacs magazine editor Jeff Wagner, Black Sabbath is the \"generally accepted starting point\" when heavy metal \"became distinct from rock and roll\". In his opinion, the album represented a transition from blues rock into \"something uglier\", and that this sound \"found deeper gravity via mournful singing and a sinister rhythmic pulse\". According to Rolling Stone magazine, \"the album that arguably invented heavy metal was built on thunderous blues-rock\". Sputnikmusic's Mike Stagno notes that Black Sabbath's combined elements of rock, jazz and blues, with heavy distortion created one of the most influential albums in the history of heavy metal. In retrospect, Black Sabbath has been lauded as perhaps the first true heavy metal album. It has also been credited as the first record in the stoner rock genre.\nTaking a broader perspective, Pete Prown of Vintage Guitar says, \"The debut Black Sabbath album of 1970 was a watershed moment in heavy rock, but it was part of a larger trend of artists, producers, and engineers already moving towards the sound we now call hard rock and heavy metal.\""

        "content": "Black Sabbath's music and lyrics were quite dark for the time. The opening track is based almost entirely on a tritone interval played at slow tempo on the electric guitar.  In the 2010 Classic Albums documentary on the making of the band's second album Paranoid, bassist Geezer Butler claims the riff was inspired by \"Mars, the Bringer of War\", a movement in Gustav Holst's The Planets. Iommi reinterpreted the riff slightly and redefined the band's direction. Ward told Classic Albums, \"When Oz sang 'What is this that stands before me?' it became completely different...this was a different lyric now, this was a different feel. I was playing drums to the words.\" The song's lyrics concern a \"figure in black\" which Geezer Butler claims to have seen after waking up from a nightmare. In the liner notes to the band's 1998 live album Reunion the bassist remembers:\n\nI'd been raised a Catholic so I totally believed in the Devil. There was a weekly magazine called Man, Myth and Magic that I started reading which was all about Satan and stuff. That and books by Aleister Crowley and Dennis Wheatley, especially The Devil Rides Out ... I'd moved into this flat I'd painted black with inverted crosses everywhere. Ozzy gave me this 16th Century book about magic that he'd stolen from somewhere. I put it in the airing cupboard because I wasn't sure about it. Later that night I woke up and saw this black shadow at the end of the bed. It was a horrible presence that frightened the life out of me!  I ran to the airing cupboard to throw the book out, but the book had disappeared. After that I gave up all that stuff. It scared me shitless.\nSimilarly, the lyrics of the song \"N.I.B.\" are written from the point of view of Lucifer, who falls in love with a human woman and \"becomes a better person\" according to lyricist Butler. Contrary to popular belief, the name of that song is not an abbreviation for \"Nativity in Black;\" according to Osbourne's autobiography it is merely a reference to drummer Bill Ward's pointed goatee at the time, which was shaped as a fountain pen-nib. The lyrics of two other songs on the album were written about stories with mythological themes. \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\" is a reference to the H. P. Lovecraft short story \"Beyond the Wall of Sleep,\" while \"The Wizard\" was inspired by the character of Gandalf from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The latter includes harmonica playing by Osbourne. The band also recorded a cover of \"Evil Woman,\" a song that had been an American hit for the band Crow. In his autobiography, Iommi admits the band reluctantly agreed to do the song at the behest of their manager Jim Simpson, who insisted they record something commercial."

Standing in front of the watermill is a figure dressed in a black cloak, portrayed by model Louisa Livingstone, whose identity was not widely known until 2020. \"I'm sure (McMillan) said it was for Black Sabbath, but I don't know if that meant anything much to me at the time,\" Livingstone recalled, adding that it had been \"freezing cold\" during the shoot. \"I had to get up at about 4 o'clock in the morning. Keith was rushing around with dry ice, throwing it into the water. It didn't seem to be working very well, so he ended up using a smoke machine,\" said the model.According to McMillan, Livingstone was wearing nothing underneath the black cloak, and some experimentation was done involving some \"slightly more risqu\u00e9\" photographs taken at the session. \"We decided none of that worked,\" McMillan said. \"Any kind of sexuality took away from the more foreboding mood. But she was a terrific model. She had amazing courage and understanding of what I was trying to do.\"The inner gatefold sleeve of the original release featured an inverted cross containing a poem written by Roger Brown, McMillan's photography assistant. The band were reportedly upset when they discovered this, as it fuelled allegations that they were satanists or occultists; however, in Osbourne's memoirs, he says that to the best of his knowledge nobody was upset with the inclusion. Iommi's recollection is somewhat different: \"Suddenly we had all these crazy people turning up at shows,\" he told Mojo magazine in 2013. \"I think Alex Sanders (high priest of the Wiccan religion) turned up at a gig once. It was all quite strange, really.\" The liner notes to the 1998 Reunion album state \"Unbeknownst to the band, Black Sabbath was launched in the U.S. with a party with the head of the Church of Satan, Anton LaVey, presiding over the proceedings... All of a sudden Sabbath were Satan's Right Hand Men.\"\nIn the years since the iconic cover photo was shot, Livingstone has released electronic music under the name Indreba."

        "content": "The boss of a black market ring (known only as \"The Chief\") wants to smuggle a batch of jewelry from a foreign state into the Soviet Union by hiding it inside the orthopedic cast of a courier. The Chief sends a minor henchman named Gennadiy 'Gesha' Kozodoyev (played by Mironov) to serve as the courier. Kozodoyev travels to Turkey via a tourist cruise ship. The local co-conspirators do not know what the courier looks like; they only know that he is supposed to say a code word to identify himself. Due to a mix-up, they mistake Kozodoyev's fellow passenger from the cruise ship, the \"ordinary Soviet citizen\" Semyon Gorbunkov (played by Nikulin) for the courier. They place a cast around his arm and put the contraband jewels inside the cast. Upon the cruise ship's return to the Soviet Union, Gorbunkov lets the police know what happened, and the police captain, who is working undercover as a taxi driver, uses Gorbunkov as bait to catch the criminals. Gesha and Lyolik (another of Chief's henchmen, played by Papanov) attempt to lure Gorbunkov into situations where they can quietly, without a wetwork, remove the cast and reclaim the contraband jewels.\nOn one such occasion, Gesha invites Gorbunkov to a fancy restaurant with the intention of getting Gorbunkov drunk enough for Lyolik to subdue him. However, both Gesha and Gorbunkov become drunk and Gorbunkov is taken home by the police after he and Gesha cause a scene. Gorbunkov's wife begins to suspect either that he has been recruited by foreign intelligence after finding a large amount of money and a gun loaded with blanks in Gorbunkov's possession (previously given to him by the police), or that he is having an affair. Gorbunkov explains that he is working with the Soviet police on a secret mission, but cannot divulge any details. The Chief sends Anna Sergeyevna, a female operative, to help retrieve the cast. Anna Sergeyevna invites Gorbunkov to her hotel room under the pretense of wanting to sell Gorbunkov a gown and spikes his drink with a sleeping pill. As Gorbunkov is about to pass out, his building's nosy superintendent who had followed Gorbunkov brings his wife into the hotel room before either Lyolik or the police can get to him.\nGorbunkov awakens the next morning to find that his wife has assumed that his story was all a cover up for an affair, and has left with the children. The police in the meantime have deduced that Gesha is involved with the smuggling scheme surrounding the cast, and ask Gorbunkov to mention to Gesha that he is planning to travel to another city and will have his cast removed there. Gesha reports this to the Chief, who sends Lyolik disguised as a taxi driver to pick up Gorbunkov. Gorbunkov assumes that Lyolik is also an undercover policeman, and gives away the fact that he has been in contact with the police the entire time. Lyolik plays along and tells Gorbunkov that he has been authorized to remove the cast a day early at a safehouse along the way to Dubrovka. As Lyolik is about to remove the cast, Gorbunkov deduces that Lyolik is actually a criminal and attempts to escape. Lyolik and Gesha chase Gorbunkov and with the help of the Chief himself, they capture Gorbunkov. Upon removing Gorbunkov's cast, they realize that the police had removed the diamonds in the cast a long time ago. The criminals kidnap Gorbunkov and attempt to flee as the police track them down in a helicopter and capture them. Gorbunkov is reunited with his family, with the police having explained the situation to his wife. Gorbunkov goes on vacation with his family, albeit now with a broken leg as a result of the kidnapping."

It was sung in the movie by the Kozodoyev during the cruise as he strums a guitar while relaxing on the ship's deck. The song is thematic, as it presages the bad luck that Kozodoyev experiences throughout the entire film. The song was recorded by Mironov himself. This is not uncommon, as many Russian actors of that time were proficient in singing, as well as dancing.\n\nThe Song About HaresThe metaphorical \"Pesnya pro zaytsev\" (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0439\u0446\u0435\u0432, lit.\u2009'Song About Hares') also became a popular song during the late 1960s. It tells the story of a group of personified hares harvesting a mythological tryn herb (in Russian: tryn-trava) at night and proclaiming that they are not afraid of any predators, be they wolves or owls. The hares boldly sing a refrain which begins with \"We don't care!\" (\"A \u043d\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e!\"), which is actually the meaning of \"tryn-trava\". The song was performed in the movie by the protagonist Semyon Gorbunkov after a heavy dose of vodka at the restaurant. Later, the scene was even depicted on a stamp dedicated to the actor Yuri Nikulin. Recorded by Nikulin himself.\n\nHelp MeThe third and final popular song from this film was \"Pomogi mne\" (Russian: \u041f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438 \u043c\u043d\u0435, lit.\u2009'Help Me') as performed by Aida Vedishcheva, a Soviet era singer best known for her performance of songs for films produced in the 1960s. The tango-styled parodic song is about love and passion, and is played in the background during a scene when a femme fatale hired by the Chief's henchmen attempts to seduce and drug Gorbunkov."

Bonham was busy elsewhere at the start of the session and a drummer Heydon Jones was hired quickly to fill in. The songs were recorded with Stevens singing and playing piano at the same time, Kendall playing acoustic guitar, and Jones or Bonham on drums. Stevens and the engineers were very happy with the results. In particular Bonham's powerful drumming touched off an impassioned performance by Stevens on the title track, which would be the English title song to the album.Gibb was supervising the session, but he did not play together with them. Later he added bass to all but \"Sweet Child of Mine\" (which is just Stevens with orchestra), organ on \"Don\u2019t Freak Me Out\", keyboard on \"When You Grow Up\", and Bill Shepherd orchestration to three songs. Kendall's acoustic guitar was just about mixed out, but he or Maurice added electric rhythm guitar to \"High Heel Blues\". All this tinkering changed the raw feel of the basic tracks.The second session for the album was in May 1972, and features Peter Frampton on guitar, Mike Kellie on drums and the orchestra was arranged by Gerry Shury. Frampton played electric guitar instead on the \"Bye Bye Love\" and added electric guitar to two others. Frampton, who was a member of Humble Pie, recorded his first solo album Wind of Change around this time, and Kellie, late of Spooky Tooth, was the drummer on it, while Bee Gees\u2019 tour drummer Chris Karan played percussion.  Two of the album's songs, \"Paid My Dues\" and \"Tears\" were covered by then former Spooky Tooth lead singer Mike Harrison, on Smokestack Lightning, his second solo album, also released in 1972,"

The album was released in 1977 in two different versions, comprising a total of 30 songs by the Beatles.\nThe performances were recorded on a home tape machine using a single microphone, resulting in a low fidelity recording. Ted \"Kingsize\" Taylor began to investigate possible marketing of the tapes in 1973. The tapes were eventually bought by Paul Murphy and subjected to extensive audio processing to improve the sound, leading to the 1977 album.\nAlthough the poor sound quality limits its commercial appeal, the album provides historic insight into the group's club act in the period after Ringo Starr joined but before the emergence of Beatlemania. The Beatles were unsuccessful in legally blocking the initial release of the album; the recordings were reissued in many forms until 1998, when the group were awarded full rights to the performances."

Rolling Stone reviewer John Swenson called the album \"poorly recorded but fascinating\" and commented that it showed The Beatles as \"raw but extremely powerful.\" Allmusic, commenting on a reissue, wrote: \"The results were very low-fidelity, and despite The Beatles' enormous success, it took Taylor fifteen years to find someone greedy and shameless enough to release them as a record\". Q magazine described the recordings as having \"certain historical interest\" and remarked: \"The show seems like a riot but the sound itself is terrible \u2013 like one hell of a great party going on next door.\" George Harrison gave the assessment: \"The Star-Club recording was the crummiest recording ever made in our name!\""

        "content": "Spanish names are the traditional way of identifying, and the official way of registering, a person in Spain. They are composed of a given name (simple or composite) and two surnames (the first surname of each parent). Traditionally, the first surname is the father's first surname, and the second is the mother's first surname. Since 1999, the order of the surnames in a family in Spain is decided when registering the first child, but the traditional order is nearly universally chosen (99.53% of the time).\nThe practice is to use one given name and the first surname generally (e.g. \"Pen\u00e9lope Cruz\" for Pen\u00e9lope Cruz S\u00e1nchez); the complete name is reserved for legal, formal and documentary matters. Both surnames are sometimes systematically used when the first surname is very common (e.g., Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Pablo Ruiz Picasso or Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero) to get a more distinguishable name. In these cases, it is even common to use only the second surname, as in \"Lorca\", \"Picasso\" or \"Zapatero\". This does not affect alphabetization: \"Lorca\", the Spanish poet, must be alphabetized in an index under \"Garc\u00eda Lorca\", not \"Lorca\" or \"Garc\u00eda\"."

Traditionally, a person's first surname is the father's first surname (apellido paterno), while their second surname is the mother's first surname (apellido materno). For example, if a man named Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez Garrido marries a woman named Mar\u00eda Dolores Mart\u00ednez Ruiz (note that women do not change their name with marriage) and they have a child named Jos\u00e9, there are several legal options, but their child would most usually be known as Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez.\nSpanish gender equality law has allowed surname transposition since 1999, subject to the condition that every sibling must bear the same surname order recorded in the Registro Civil (civil registry), but there have been legal exceptions. Since 2013, if the parents of a child were unable to agree on the order of surnames, an official would decide which is to come first, with the paternal name being the default option. The only requirement is that every son and daughter must have the same order of the surnames, so they cannot change it separately. Since June 2017, adopting the paternal name first is no longer the standard method, and parents are required to sign an agreement wherein the name order is expressed explicitly. The law also grants a person the option, upon reaching adulthood, of reversing the order of their surnames. However, this legislation only applies to Spanish citizens; people of other nationalities are issued the surname indicated by the laws of their original country.Each of these two surnames can also be composite in itself, with the parts usually linked by:\n\nthe conjunction y or e (and),\nthe preposition de (of), or\na hyphen.For example, a person's name might be Juan Pablo Fern\u00e1ndez de Calder\u00f3n Garc\u00eda-Iglesias, consisting of a forename (Juan Pablo), a paternal surname (Fern\u00e1ndez de Calder\u00f3n), and a maternal surname (Garc\u00eda-Iglesias)."

When there are two family names, the indexing is done under the father's family name; this would be the first element of the surname if the father's and mother's or husband's family names are joined by a y. Depending upon the person involved, the particle de may be treated as a part of a family name or it may be separated from a family name. The indexing of Hispanophone names differs from that of Portuguese or Lusophone names, where the final element of the name is indexed because the Portuguese custom is for the father's surname to follow, rather than precede, the mother's. The effect is that the father's surname is the one indexed for both Spanish and Portuguese names."

It was subtitled The London Charivari in homage to Charles Philipon's French satirical humour magazine Le Charivari. Reflecting their satiric and humorous intent, the two editors took for their name and masthead the anarchic glove puppet, Mr. Punch, of Punch and Judy; the name also referred to a joke made early on about one of the magazine's first editors, Lemon, that \"punch is nothing without lemon\". Mayhew ceased to be joint editor in 1842 and became \"suggestor in chief\" until he severed his connection in 1845. The magazine initially struggled for readers, except for an 1842 \"Almanack\" issue which shocked its creators by selling 90,000 copies. In December 1842 due to financial difficulties, the magazine was sold to Bradbury and Evans, both printers and publishers. Bradbury and Evans capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies and also were the publishers for Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray."

However, the inheritance is saddled with debts, and the brothers must decide whether or not to accept it.  Eugene accepts the inheritance and buys off his brother's portion, thinking that he can sell off large tracts of land while making improvements to the rest.  Living alone with his mother while working on the farm, Eugene misses the relations he had with women while living in St. Petersburg.  He inquires around the village, and the watchman introduces Eugene to a local peasant named Stepanida whose husband lives away in the city.  For several months Eugene and Stepanida have encounters, with Eugene paying her each time.  Eventually, Eugene's mother thinks it is time for him to get married, preferably to an heiress who will help them with their debts.  To her disappointment, Eugene falls in love with Liza Annenskaya, a charming middle-class girl, and they are married after Eugene breaks off relations with Stepanida.\nAfter a year of marriage, Liza employs two peasant women to help with cleaning the estate.  One of them is Stepanida.  When Eugene notices her, all the passion for her that he thought was forgotten comes rushing back.  He can't stop thinking about her and decides that she must be sent away.  Liza later suffers a harmful fall while pregnant, and Eugene takes her for a rest cure to Crimea for two months on doctor's orders.  She gives birth to a daughter, and Eugene's financial prospects are starting to look promising.  His estate is described as being in the best working condition it has ever been, and he thinks he is finally happy.\nAt a village festival, Eugene notices Stepanida dancing, and their glances re-awaken his desire.  Tormented by lust, he thinks of resuming relations with her, but realizes that the affair would cause too much of a scandal.  Eugene says of Stepanida, \"Really, she is--a devil. Simply a devil. She has possessed herself of me against my own will.\"  He convinces himself that there are only two options: to kill Stepanida, or to kill his wife and run off with Stepanida.  Eugene then thinks of a third option, which is to commit suicide.  When his family finds him dead of a revolver shot, they cannot understand why he killed himself since, although he was evidently tormented, he did not confide in his closest relatives."

It was first sold as a supplement to France-Soir, edited at the time by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's husband, Pierre Lazareff. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, Elle's pioneering founder, returned to Paris from New York City to create a unique publication that grappled with the many forces shaping women's lives in France in 1945. Women won the right to vote in 1944, and Elle dove immediately into long-form \"newspaper-like\" features on women's role in national politics and the growing feminist movement. Elle would \"celebrate a new type of woman: independent, modern, active, comfortable in her own skin and her time\". The first issue of Elle France was published on 21 November 1945 featuring Yolande Bloin on the cover dressed by Elsa Schiaparelli. Bloin was an actress in Jacques Becker's film Falbalas. The magazine had a circulation of 110,000 copies in 1945.In the Elle articles featuring rising fashion designers, the magazine would provide free patterns of some of their fashion pieces. This allowed the general public to experience haute couture as the glamour of the fashion world was becoming accessible to the common working class.Its 100th issue, published on 14 October 1947, featured the work of Christian Dior just eight months after his debut show. Likewise, Brigitte Bardot had her first Elle cover at age 17, on 7 January 1952, months before her screen debut in Manina, the Girl in the Bikini.\nOn 2 April 1956, Grace Kelly appeared on the cover of Elle France, a few days before her marriage to Rainier III, Prince of Monaco. On 16 July 1956, Elle France featured Marilyn Monroe on the cover.By the 1960s, Elle had a readership of 800,000 across France and was said to \"not so much reflect fashion as decree it.\" This dominance was reflected in the famous slogan: \"Si elle lit elle lit Elle (If she reads, she reads Elle)\" (lit. \"If she reads she reads She\").Lagard\u00e8re Group subsidiary, Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias began pushing Elle outside of France in 1985, launching Elle in the UK and the United States. The Chinese version of the magazine was first published in 1988. It was the first four-colour fashion magazine offered in China. The magazine was an informational and educational tool for opening the Chinese textile market.In 1987, Elle Decoration was launched in France by the Lagard\u00e8re Group.

On 6 February 2006, two armed men broke into the offices of El Ma\u00f1ana and detonated a grenade. They also shot the outside walls of the installation with AK-47s and AR-15s before fleeing the scene. According to La Jornada, the armed men shot the installation more than 100 times, injuring Jaime Orozco Tey, a journalist. On 30 July 2010, a group of armed men in a vehicle threw a grenade at the offices of Televisa in Nuevo Laredo, damaging two vehicles. On 26 September 2011, Elizabeth Macias-Castro, an editor of la Primera Hora newspaper, was decapitated; a note was left behind by Los Zetas, claiming responsibility for the killing. A group of armed men attacked the offices of El Ma\u00f1ana newspaper in Nuevo Laredo at around 23:00 hours on 11 May 2012. The Mexican authorities stated that no one was injured in the 5-minute shootout, but the offices and some vehicles were damaged when bullets impacted from the outside. When the employees of El Ma\u00f1ana heard the detonations, they threw themselves on the floor, while others suffered nervous breakdowns. Some witnesses said that they heard grenade explosions during the attack. In addition, a message was reportedly left behind by the perpetrators.Due to the violent attacks the press has received in Nuevo Laredo, news media have practiced \"self-censorship,\" where local journalist prefer to silence the press and refuse to report on important incidents for fears of reprisals by the cartels. Events that would go on the front-page of any newspaper\u2014mass murders with over six dead, shooting incidents wounding three soldiers\u2014often go unreported in Nuevo Laredo. The cartels want the cities they control to appear calm in order to prevent the government from sending federal troops. Consequently, the press, tired of extortions and death threats, prefers to silence because there is no guarantee for their safety. On 14 May 2012, El Ma\u00f1ana declared that it will no longer report on news relating to drug-violence.On 14 May 2013, the newspaper suffered a cyber-attack on its official website. According to El Ma\u00f1ana, the attacks are intended to saturate the page and damage information databases of the newspaper, particularly in columns where they question the performance of local officials."

An agent of a local pharmaceutical company meets the captain of the Soviet vessel and discusses the cargo, medical opium, which is in critical demand by the hospitals of the USSR. Soon after that the pharmaceutical company agent is seen inside a car, speaking to someone via walkie-talkie.  Later the MV Nezhin, with the opium on board, leaves port for Vladivostok.Some distance into the voyage, a watchman cries \"man overboard\" and the captain orders the engines stopped to rescue the stranded swimmer. The boat from Nezhin picks up an Asian man who identifies himself as Salekh, the only surviving sailor from a foreign merchant ship. Salekh told the crew that his ship suddenly capsized during a heavy storm and his crewmates were fighting for places in rescue boats. Shortly after that the Soviet captain is informed of an unknown ship, drifting nearby. The ship, called the Mercury, is apparently abandoned, with no crew visible and no activity on deck. The captain of the Nezhin decides to send four men to explore the ship and offer assistance to possible survivors.\nHowever, the abandoned ship turns out to be a trap for the Soviets. Occupied with the Mercury, none of the Russian crewmen pays any attention to Salekh, who takes an axe from the ship's firefighting kit, enters the radio room of the Nezhin, and attacks a radio operator, killing him. After Salekh destroys the ship's radio equipment, the Mercury starts her engines and approaches the Nezhin. At that moment, the Nezhin's crew see the bodies of the boarding party, floating in the water behind the Mercury. The Soviet captain realizes that his ship is under attack by pirates.\nTheir attempt to escape is foiled when the Mercury rams the ship and the pirates open fire with assault rifles and machine guns. The pirates board the Nezhin, brutally killing Russian crew members who fight them. Sergey, the chief-mate of the Nezhin, discovers the dead radio operator and decides to find Salekh. Chasing Salekh through the corridors of the ship, Sergey makes an attempt to stop him. Salekh shows impressive martial arts skills and quickly defeats the chief-mate. Soon after, the pirates lock the remaining Russians into crew compartments and begin to offload the opium to the Mercury. The pirate captain thanks Salekh for a successful mission and orders him to blow up the Nezhin together with her crew. The Soviets, left to die on a sinking ship, manage to escape and must fight the pirates for survival."

It was premiered in 1923 at La Scala in Milan, under the baton of Antonio Guarnieri, since Toscanini was unavailable. The cast featured Irish soprano Margaret Burke Sheridan as Candida, baritone Mariano Stabile as her lover Baldo, and tenor Francesco Merli as the titular Belfagor, an arcidiavolo (Archdemon) who tries to marry a human maiden while in disguise as a nobleman, using gifts of money to her father.The premi\u00e8re obtained a \"full and warm\" approval, with several curtain calls for the composer, but the opinion of the critics was divided, ranging from the enthusiasm of Marinetti, enchanted by the futuristic aspects of the opera, and of the music critic S. A. Lucani, to those who judged the opera and libretto absolutely not enjoyable. Gaetano Cesari wrote that this work looked like an attempt, not fully accomplished, to merge in a comic opera \"the fabolous and the clownish, the miraculous and the sentimental\" and that the comic expressivity was damaged by the absence of \"assertiveness of the melodic plan and its capacity to develop rapidly\"."

The release of Family's similarly titled debut prompted them to adopt the minimalist title The Beatles for what is now commonly referred to as the \"White Album\" due to its plain white sleeve.\n\"Old Songs, New Songs\" features a cameo from the Tubby Hayes group, arranged by 18-year-old Mike Batt. Hayes played the tenor sax solo at the end of the track (uncredited). Batt also arranged and conducted other strings and brass for the album, notably \"The Chase\" and \"Mellowing Grey\" but was not credited.The album was the first by an English rock group to be released on the US Reprise label (which had originally been set up by Frank Sinatra but was now owned by Warner Bros). It was licensed to the label by Dukeslodge Enterprises, a company run by the band's manager, John Gilbert, who was credited as 'executive producer' of the album. The album was released on vinyl in mono (RLP6312), stereo (RSLP6312) and on Stereo 8 Track Cartridge. In an interview for ZigZag magazine, Whitney reported that due to only having four track recording equipment final overdubs were done live during the mix so mono vinyl copies had a different mix to the stereo version; due to a pressing error the record would jump the grooves during playback so the mono release was withdrawn.This album was initially issued in the US using the UK import and sold in the US as a domestic album with an extra piece of cardboard to stiffen the sleeve (as they essentially had the same catalog number in both countries).  Around the time the second album was issued in the US, US pressings of this album started to appear.  (The album also initially had a 12\" black and white photo of the group included as an insert.)"

Zumoto closely tied the operations of the two newspapers, with subscriptions of The Seoul Press being sold in Japan by The Japan Times, and vice versa for Korea. Both papers wrote critically of Korean culture and civilization, and advocated for Japan's colonial control over the peninsula in order to civilize the Koreans.The newspaper was independent of government control, but from 1931 onward, the paper's editors experienced mounting pressure from the Japanese government to submit to its policies. In 1933, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed Hitoshi Ashida, former ministry official, as chief editor.During World War II, the newspaper served as an outlet for Imperial Japanese government communication and editorial opinion. It was successively renamed The Japan Times and Mail (1918\u20131940) following its merger with The Japan Mail, The Japan Times and Advertiser (1940\u20131943) following its merger with The Japan Advertiser, and Nippon Times (1943\u20131956), before reverting to the Japan Times title in 1956. The temporary change to Nippon Times occurred during the ban on English language sentiment during World War II-era Japan.Shintaro Fukushima (1907\u20131987) became president of The Japan Times in 1956. He sold some of the company's shares to Toshiaki Ogasawara  (\u5c0f\u7b20\u539f \u654f\u6676 Ogasawara Toshiaki), who was chairman of Nifco, a manufacturer of automotive fasteners. Fukushima renounced management rights in 1983, after which Nifco acquired control of The Japan Times and brought about staff changes and alterations to the company's traditions established in 1897. Ogasawara served as the chairman and publisher of The Japan Times until 2016, when his daughter Yukiko Ogasawara (\u5c0f\u7b20\u539f \u6709\u8f1d\u5b50 Ogasawara Yukiko) succeeded him as chairman of the company. She had previously served as the company's president from 2006 to 2012, when she was replaced by career Japan Times staffer Takeharu Tsutsumi.

In response to these criticisms, The Japan Times wrote in an article on 7 December 2018, \"We must admit that the editorial note undermined the relationships of trust we have built with our readers, reporters and staff.

One night, Tomsky tells a story about his grandmother, a  countess. Many years ago, in France, she lost a fortune at faro, and then won it back with the secret of the three winning cards, which she learned from the notorious Count of St. Germain. Hermann becomes obsessed with obtaining the secret.\nThe countess (now 87 years old) has a young ward, Lizavyeta Ivanovna. Hermann sends love letters to Lizavyeta, and persuades her to let him into the house. There Hermann accosts the countess, demanding the secret. She first tells him that story was a joke. Hermann persists, but she refuses to speak. Finally he threatens her with a pistol, and she dies of fright. He flees to Lizavyeta's apartment (in the same building) and tells her what has happened.  He defends himself by saying the pistol was not loaded. Though Lizavyeta helps him escape, she is disgusted to learn that his attentions to her were motivated by greed.\nHermann attends the funeral of the countess, and is terrified to see the countess open her eyes in the coffin and look at him. Later that night, her ghost appears to him and names the secret three cards (three, seven, and ace).  It tells him he must play just once each night and then orders him to marry Lizavyeta. Hermann takes his entire savings to Chekalinsky's salon, where wealthy men gamble at faro for high stakes. On the first night, he bets it all on the three and wins. On the second night, he wins on the seven. On the third night, he bets on the ace\u2014but when the cards are shown, he finds he has bet on the Queen of Spades, not the ace, and he loses everything. When the Queen appears to wink at him, he is astonished by her remarkable resemblance to the old countess, and flees in terror. \nIn a short conclusion, Pushkin writes that Lizavyeta marries the son of the Countess' former steward, a state official who makes a good salary. Hermann, however, goes mad and is committed to an asylum. He is installed in Room 17 at the Obukhov hospital; he answers no questions, but merely mutters with unusual rapidity: \"Three, seven, ace! Three, seven, queen!\""

        "content": "The countess was inspired by Princess Natalya Petrovna Golitsyna, who served as lady-in-waiting for five Russian emperors and was 92 at the time Pushkin wrote \"The Queen of Spades\". According to a legend, Golitsyna had been a successful gambler. When her grandson lost a considerable amount of money playing cards and came to her to beg her for money, Golitsyna instead revealed to him the secret three cards that Count Saint-Germain showed to her in Paris. However, while the Countess died in the story, Golitsyna outlived Pushkin and reached the age of 97.Some critics believe the Count Saint-Germain holds historical importance in the story. Saint-Germain serves as the namesake for the story's protagonist, Hermann. Beyond this, the historical Saint-Germain may represent a father figure for Hermann, the antithesis to Hermann's character, or a former love interest of the countess who seeks revenge for her death by causing Hermann to pick the wrong cards.The card game of faro is played by having a player bet on a winning card. The dealer then begins turning over cards, turning the first (known as \"soda\") to his left. The second card is placed face up to his right; this is the first winning card. The third card is placed face up in the left pile, as a losing card. The dealer continues turning over cards, alternating piles until the bet has been won or lost."

These metapoetic moments refer to the story dealing with stories internally. One of the clearest example of this takes place after Hermann\u2019s encounter with the countess\u2019 ghostly form. After her departure, Hermann immediately writes down his vision, recording it on paper and writing a small story within the larger story of The Queen of Spades. A second example is when Tomsky and his grandmother talk about traditional plot lines within a Russian novel, of which his grandmother denies the existence."

Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Danmarks Radio (DR), the contest was held at Tivolis Koncertsal on 21 March 1964, and was hosted by Danish TV presenter Lotte W\u00e6ver.\nSixteen countries participated in the contest. Portugal made its debut this year, whereas Sweden decided not to enter.\nThe winner of the contest was Italy with the song \"Non ho l'et\u00e0\", performed by Gigliola Cinquetti, written by Nicola Salerno and composed by Mario Panzeri. At the age of 16 years and 92 days, Gigliola Cinquetti became the youngest winner of the contest yet; a record she held until 1986. The entry had one of the widest margins of victory ever witnessed in the competition. It garnered almost three times as many points as the second-placed song.\nBesides the 1956 contest, the 1964 contest is the only other one of which there are no surviving video recordings."

Whilst this was going on, television viewers were shown a shot of the scoreboard; once the man was removed the contest went on.The interval act consisted of a ballet dance performance by dancers Solveig \u00d8stergaard, Niels Kehlet, Inge Olafsen and Mette H\u00f8nningen from the Royal Danish Ballet, choreographed by Niels Bj\u00f8rn Larsen, and over the music of the \"Columbine porka mazurka\" and the \"Champagne Galop\" by Hans Christian Lumbye.The immediate response of the Koncertsal audience to the Italian entry was markedly enthusiastic and prolonged and, most unusually for a contest performance, after leaving the stage Gigliola Cinquetti was allowed to return to take a second bow. Her performance was given an unscheduled repeat on British television the following afternoon. In the event, she won the most crushing victory in the history of the contest, with a score almost three times that of her nearest rival, a feat extremely unlikely ever to be beaten under the post-1974 scoring system.\nAn aftershow party was held for the participating delegations at the restaurant Ambassadeur in Copenhagen. Each of the 16 participating acts was awarded a silver trophy on this occasion."

In 2012, the website became the first commercially run United States digital media enterprise to win a Pulitzer Prize.Founded by Arianna Huffington, Andrew Breitbart, Kenneth Lerer, and Jonah Peretti, the site was launched on May 9, 2005, as a counterpart to the Drudge Report. In March 2011, it was acquired by AOL for US$315 million, with Arianna Huffington appointed editor-in-chief. In June 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for US$4.4 billion, and the site became a part of Verizon Media. In November 2020, BuzzFeed acquired the company.

It was founded by Arianna Huffington, Andrew Breitbart, Kenneth Lerer, and Jonah Peretti. Prior to this, Arianna Huffington hosted the website Ariannaonline.com. Her first foray into the Internet was the website Resignation.com, which called for the resignation of President Bill Clinton and was a rallying place for conservatives opposing Clinton.An early Huffington Post strategy was crafting search-engine optimized (SEO) stories and headlines based around trending keywords, such as \"What Time Is the Super Bowl?\"In August 2006, The Huffington Post raised a $5 million Series A round from SoftBank Capital and Greycroft.In December 2008, The Huffington Post raised $25 million from Oak Investment Partners at a $100 million valuation and Fred Harman of Oak Investment Partners joined its board of directors. The money was to be used for technology, infrastructure, investigative journalism, and development of local versions.In June 2009, Eric Hippeau, co-managing partner of Softbank Capital, became CEO of The Huffington Post.In January 2011, The Huffington Post received 35% of its traffic from web search engines (SEOs), compared to 20% at CNN. This strategy appealed to AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, who tried to implement similar SEO-driven journalism practices at AOL at the time of its acquisition of The Huffington Post.In March 2011, AOL acquired The Huffington Post for US$315 million. As part of the deal, Huffington became president and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post and existing AOL properties Engadget, TechCrunch, Moviefone, MapQuest, Black Voices, PopEater (now HuffPost Celebrity), AOL Music, AOL Latino (now HuffPost Voices), AutoBlog, Patch, and StyleList.In December 2011, The Huffington Post said it had 36.2 million unique visitors.The Huffington Post subsumed many of AOL's Voices properties, including AOL Black Voices, which was established in 1995 as Blackvoices.com, and AOL Latino, Impact (launched in 2010 as a partnership between Huffington Post and Causecast), Women, Teen, College, Religion, and the Spanish-language Voces (en espa\u00f1ol). The Voices brand was expanded in September 2011 with the launch of Gay Voices, dedicated to LGBT-relevant articles.By late 2013, the website operated as a \"stand-alone business\" within AOL, taking control of more of its own business and advertising operations, and directing more effort towards securing \"premium advertising\".In June 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for US$4.4 billion and the site became a part of Verizon Media.Huffington resigned to pursue other ventures and was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Lydia Polgreen in December 2016.In April 2017, Polgreen announced the company would rebrand, changing its official full name to HuffPost, with changes to the design of its website and logo, and content and reporting.On January 24, 2019, 20 employees were laid off as a part of Verizon Media laying off 7% of its staff. The opinion and health sections were eliminated. Pulitzer Prize finalist Jason Cherkis lost his job.On March 6, 2020, Polgreen announced that she would step down as editor-in-chief to become the head of content at Gimlet Media.In November 2020, HuffPost shut down its India operation after six years. According to some media reports, the acquisition did not include the India site due to regulations barring foreign ownership of Indian Digital Media.On February 16, 2021, BuzzFeed acquired HuffPost from Verizon Media in a stock deal. On March 9, 2021, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti said that the company had lost \"around $20 million\" during the previous year, and HuffPost Canada was shut down and ceased publishing.\nOn April 12, 2021, Danielle Belton became editor-in-chief.Following the gradual shut-down of BuzzFeed News announced in 2023, BuzzFeed, Inc. refocused its news efforts into HuffPost, with plans to rehire past BuzzFeed News employees at HuffPost or  at BuzzFeed."

Upon becoming the editor-in-chief in December 2016, Lydia Polgreen said that the \"wave of intolerance and bigotry that seems to be sweeping the globe\" after the election as US president of Donald Trump was remarkable, and that The Huffington Post had an \"absolutely indispensable role to play in this era in human history.\"Commenting in 2012 on increased conservative engagement on the website despite its reputation as a liberal news source, The Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington stated that her website was \"increasingly seen\" as an Internet newspaper that is \"not positioned ideologically in terms of how we cover the news\". According to Michael Steel, press secretary for Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner, Republican aides \"engage with liberal websites like The Huffington Post [anyway, if for] no other reason than [because] they drive a lot of cable coverage\". Jon Bekken, journalism professor at Suffolk University, has cited it as an example of an \"advocacy newspaper\". The Wall Street Journal editor James Taranto has mockingly referred to it as the \"Puffington Host\", while Rush Limbaugh referred to it as the \"Huffing and Puffington Post\".During the 2016 United States presidential election, HuffPost regularly appended an editor's note to the end of stories about candidate Donald Trump, reading: \"Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims\u20141.6 billion members of an entire religion\u2014from entering the U.S.\" After Trump was elected on November 8, 2016, HuffPost ended this practice to \"give respect to the office of the presidency.\""

Chrisye was uncertain that this would work. The album was recorded with Chrisye on vocals and bass guitar, Jockie on keyboard, Jerry on electric and acoustic guitar, and Yaya M. on drums. Indah Sukotjo provided backing vocals for \"Tragedi Badai\" (\"Tragedy of the Storm\"). The arrangement was handled by Jockie, who also wrote most of the lyrics; Harry Sabar wrote the lyrics for three songs, while Jockie did seven.Ayik Soegeng, who had previously designed the cover for Guruh Gipsy \u2013 a collaboration between Guruh Sukarnoputra and Sabda Nada, a band featuring Chrisye \u2013 in 1976, was selected to design the cover for Pantulan Cita. The photographers Firman Ichsan and Tara Sastrowardoyo initially intended to have a portrait of Chrisye holding a headshot of himself over his face. However, the photographer later decided that portraying  Chrisye's face on a puzzle would be more effective. Soegeng was asked to create the puzzle, taking the photograph initially meant to be held by Chrisye, gluing it to plywood, then cutting out the puzzle with a jigsaw.

Using the Mining Encyclopedia, Biletsky has contributed over 10,000 articles on the subject to Ukrainian Wikipedia. In 2013, the Institute of History of Ukraine at the National Academy of Science gave permission to the Ukrainian Wikipedia to use the digital version of the Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine that was published online. The Higher School Academy of Science and Forest Engineering also allowed Wikipedia to freely use their information resources.Generally, before the 2014 Maidan Revolution, Ukrainian Wikipedia hold approximately the 10 to 20 percent of the pageviews from Ukraine, depending on the season and steadily growing, reaching for first time a share of above 20% in late 2013. The success of Euromaidan and the subsequent improvement in Ukrainian language's status have positively impacted the reach of Ukrainian Wikipedia.One of the areas where activity is notable is in Wiki Loves Monuments project, an annual international photo contest focused on cultural and historical monuments. Ukrainian Wikipedians were ranked 4th among 36 participating countries for the number of uploads of images as part of this project in 2012. In 2014, Ukrainian Wikipedians were the winners of the contest that year.\nAs of May 2023, the Ukrainian Wikipedia is the second most popular Wikipedia in Ukraine, slightly below Russian, despite that both language versions have more than a million articles. This is attributed to the historic bilingualism in Ukraine, the Russification of Ukraine and the Ukrainian language during the Tsarist and Soviet era, and the popularity of Russian-language content in present-day Ukraine. However, the popularity of Ukrainian Wikipedia in Ukraine is increasing every year, compared to the Russian version. \nIn January 2016, the ratio of Russian to Ukrainian Wikipedia use was 4.6 times, decreasing to 2.6 times in January 2019, 2.4 times in January 2020, and 2 times in January 2021. Extrapolation shows that in 2025, in Ukraine, the popularity of the Ukrainian Wikipedia will be higher than the popularity of the Russian Wikipedia.Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the difference between the two languages has further decreased, and in October 2022 it was just ten million pageviews (100 million pageviews for Russian in Ukraine and 90 million pageviews for Ukrainian), the lowest ever recorded. Due to the fact that many students consult Ukrainian Wikipedia for information about the literature works, the writers and other parts of the school curriculum, the pageviews of Ukrainian Wikipedia are generally halving during the summer. This trend is observed in many other Wikipedias of the former Soviet space, including Kazakh and Uzbek ones. The impact of this trend tends however to decrease as of 2023. In July 2023 Ukrainian had 61 million pageviews and Russian 87 million pageviews in Ukraine which is lesser than half of the difference 72 million pageviews (112 to 40) in July 2021."

It was aired for the first time on 27 July 2013 on Channel 4, in conjunction with Pulse Films and One Little Indian Records. Partly filmed at the Natural History Museum in London, the documentary features an encounter between Icelandic singer-songwriter and musician Bj\u00f6rk and English broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough. They discuss the nature of music and the intersection between music, nature and technology. It also follows the singer as she prepares for her Biophilia Tour, along with rehearsal and studio recording.\nThe documentary was inspired by the singer's eighth studio album Biophilia (2011), which was released as a series of apps which blends nature elements with musicology. Collaborators in the project Scott Snibbe, Damian Taylor, and Andy Cavatorta appear in the documentary to talk about their role in the development of the album and the live show. It also includes neurologist Oliver Sacks, who talks about the effect of music on the brain.\nDespite the low ratings, the show received positive to moderate reviews from critics, who applauded the content of the documentary but, in some cases, criticised the interaction between Attenborough and Bj\u00f6rk, which was considered \"awkward\" and \"unlikely\". The documentary was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 5 May 2014."

        "content": "When the Biophilia project was first unveiled, it was announced that a documentary including footage of studio recording, interviews and rehearsal for the live performances, which would culminate in the first live performance at the Manchester International Festival, was in the works. While the original idea for the documentary never materialised, the project evolved as a mutual collaboration between David Attenborough and Bj\u00f6rk herself. On 1 August 2012, it was reported that UK Channel 4 had inked a deal to air a documentary, tentatively titled Attenborough and Bj\u00f6rk: The Nature of Music, that would have included a discussion between the two about the story of music, human's relationship with it and how technology could evolve the way we engage with it. The documentary was inspired by the Biophilia project and would have featured footage commented by Attenborough, along with a showcase of the instruments created for the Biophilia Tour. British-American neurologist Oliver Sacks was also reported to appear in the documentary, explaining \"the extraordinary and beneficial effects music has on our brains\". The documentary, made by the company Pulse Films, is the first time the British television channel and the company had collaborated. It was directed by Louise Hooper and executive produced by Lucas Ochoa, who commented about the project:\n\n\"Born from Bjork's revolutionary music project we are thrilled to be able to document this incredible journey with her; she is undeniably one of the most iconic figures in popular culture and truly pushes boundaries like no other artist does.\"\nThe English naturalist had previously provided the spoken introduction for the live shows and the apps. The two had long admired each other's works. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bj\u00f6rk had confessed that, when she was a kid, she considered Attenborough her \"rock star\". Attenborough stated that the singer \"is really quite enchanting\" and called her \"honey\" during the filming, reportedly because he could not pronounce her name properly. Bj\u00f6rk stated about the experience of the filming with Attenborough: \"He would close off and take in whatever I was saying, and then just come out with the most beautifully formed sentences you ever heard\". Director Hooper, whose father John had filmed Attenborough in different documentaries settled in Papua New Guinea, Mali and the Amazon rainforest, had stated:\n\n\"There is an unexpected chemistry and fun between these two unique characters. They are both icons of their own separate worlds of music and nature, and both excited and curious to explore how these two worlds come together. Seeing Bjork and Sir David laughing and engaging with each other on screen is simply magical, it was fascinating to have the chance to bring Sir David and Bjork together for the first time on television. They were both great fun to work with; Bjork fizzing with ideas for the film and Sir David bringing his passion and knowledge\".\nThe documentary was scheduled to air during November 2012 and to see a later limited cinema release in an extended cut. As of November 2012, the documentary was still in the editing. In June 2013, it was reported that the documentary would have its worldwide premiere at the Cortona Mix Festival in Italy. The festival then cancelled the projection. The documentary first aired on Channel 4 on 27 July 2013 as part of a series of documentaries called Mad4Music, now titled When Bj\u00f6rk Met Attenborough.When a crowdfunding was created on Kickstarter to fund the release of Biophilia on Android, one of the reward available for the backers who would have pledged \u00a3120 or more was one early viewing DVD copy of the documentary. After Bj\u00f6rk had found a cheaper way to transport the apps on Android, the funding was cancelled. On 21 March 2014, it was announced that the documentary would be released on 5 May 2014 on DVD and Blu-ray. Before the release of the DVD, the documentary was shown for three nights at the MK2 Grand Palais in Paris, and it was also shown during the We Love Green festival."

        "content": "The documentary opens with an introduction by Tilda Swinton, who gives a backstory about Bj\u00f6rk's career and her intention with the Biophilia project, stating that the singer conceived the project wanting to redefine music in the 21st Century. Images from the \"Moon and \"Mutual Core\" music videos accompany her speech. After that, some frames focus on the Graduale Nobili who are singing the backing vocals to \"Thunderbolt\" on a cliff in front of the ocean in Iceland. Thereafter the scene shifts to an early rehearsal of the Biophilia songs in Iceland during November 2010. The choir begin to learn their parts in \"Thunderbolt\" and \"Moon\" under the guide of the singer. After that, the documentary shows the encounter between Bj\u00f6rk and Sir David Attenborough in the Natural History Museum in London. There, the naturalist and the singer discuss about the nature of music. They first talk about the importance of music and singing in the nature, with Attenborough explaining how music works for birds like the bird-of-paradise and the lyrebird, whose chirping is defined by the naturalist the \"most complex sound ever\", and he goes on by stating that the bird has developed an \"impressive vocal range\" which he compares to that of Bj\u00f6rk. Attenborough states that the human larynx is capable of many more sounds that preceded language. Therefore, the singer asks him how he thinks music works for the modern people, and the naturalist explains how he thinks popular music is \"extremely sexual\", comparing popular music to medieval troubadors, and that is why is so relatable to young people and animals, i.e. the gibbons, which mate by singing together out of excitement. Attenborough affirms that \"the mystery is how music has been used by humanity for something that is transcendental\".\nFootage from another rehearsal with the choir singing \"Dark Matter\" are shown before shifting to the encounter between Bj\u00f6rk and Henry Dagg in a metal workshop. Dagg had created the Sharpsichord, a solar powered cross between a harp and a barrel organ, which Bj\u00f6rk wanted to incorporate in one song. They are shown rehearsing \"Sacrifice\" and discussing the composition of the song. Attenborough states that our emotion comes from nature and that a composer has to be in contact with it. He then manages to compare the sound of Benjamin Britten's Sea interludes (which is playing in the background) to the sound of waves. The natural structure of music inspires Bj\u00f6rk who wants to bring nature in her composition. To discuss \"Crystalline\", Bj\u00f6rk and Attenborough go to the crystal room of the museum. They talk about the mathematical basis of Bj\u00f6rk's songs, who explains the time signatures of the verses and the chorus of \"Crystalline\" and compares the composition of a crystal to that of a song. Scenes from the choir recording parts of \"Crystalline\" guided by Biophilia musical director Matt Robertson are shown. Attenborough thinks that the beauty of mathematics can be heard in composition like the \"Fugue 5\" by Johann Sebastian Bach. Swinton tells how universe is made of patterns which are present in music but that we can't visualise, and how Bj\u00f6rk wants to change that. Because of that, the singer collaborates with Evan Grant, who works with cymatics. Grant explains how the Chladni plate works, and that he appreciates how Bj\u00f6rk tries to bring a real meaning in her music by taking a \"scientific and realistic approach\" to it. Grant tries to use cymatics on water for \"Crystalline\", which results can be seen in the music video for the song (directed by Michel Gondry).\nSwinton explains how Bj\u00f6rk's aim is to bring nature on stage for the Biophilia performance. Footage from the final rehearsal at Campfield Market Hall in Manchester for Biophilia world premiere at the Manchester International Festival is shown, with the Sharpsichord arriving at the venue. Some of other instruments used during the show are presented, like MIDI-controlled Tesla coil, invented by Nikola Tesla, and a gravity-harnessed pendulum harp invented by Andy Cavatorta of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Cavatorta recounts how Bj\u00f6rk declared to him that she wanted nature to appear like \"some sort of a rock star on stage\", and tells that the first prototypes of the instruments were filmed and shown to Bj\u00f6rk before she approved the final result. In one of the prototypes video the inventor puts a figurine of Bj\u00f6rk (as pictured in the Volta album cover) between the swings. The instrument, created solely for the \"Solstice\" performance, was commissioned because, as Bj\u00f6rk declares, the singer \"got obsessed\" with basslines (she hums a bassline of a composition by John Tavener as she says so).\n\nOne of the major inspiration of the project itself, neurologist Oliver Sacks, who Bj\u00f6rk define as the \"David Attenborough of the brain\", lists the benefits music has on human and explains how when a human listens to music every part of the brain gets involved. This is very useful to people who suffers from dementia, who need evocative music which can help them in building a bridge to their past. Scenes from a nursing home, in which various patients with dementia are shown to benefit from different music played to them, accompany Sacks' speech. He affirms that the music expresses something that language can't.\nScenes from the first performance of Biophilia are shown. David Attenborough's intro, which accompany the show, is partially heard, while Bj\u00f6rk affirms that music is a catalyst between the outer world and the inner world. A performance of \"Thunderbolt\" is partially shown, during which the singer is seen wearing a dress by Michael van der Ham, along with a big red wig, while the Tesla coil plays on stage. Swinton states that Biophilia \"nature, music and technology come together\" and that the Icelandic singer wants to develop a new kind of music-making which is \"intuitive and accessible for everyone\". This is driven by her desire to change we think of music, because, as the singer herself explains, by recounting her musical education, the \"academic approach to music is a barrier to people actually making music\". Oliver Sacks agrees with her by stating that the sheet music and the keys of a piano are \"intimidating and much more complicated than language\". Because of that, the singer tries to use technology to make it more intuitive. As a consequence of this, Bj\u00f6rk works with Damian Taylor. Taylor tries to use a ball and a cardboard box, along with a gamepad, instead of a keyboard. Bj\u00f6rk's solution came with the diffusion of tablet computer, which touch screen the singer compares to a tambourine for its being spontaneous and instinctive. By developing this idea, she decides to make a different format of album, made with apps. She works with interactive media artist Scott Snibbe, who states that her aim is the turn music \"into something full sensory\".\nBj\u00f6rk explains some of the apps that are part of the album, like \"Moon\", which app deals with sequences, \"Mutual Core\", in which chords are represented with strata, and \"Thunderbolt\", which use lightnings as visual representation of arpeggios. Bj\u00f6rk states that a famous example of arpeggio is \"I Feel Love\" by Donna Summer. Snibbe then affirms that, \"if we change the visual representation, the way in which people think about music is changed\". To engage people with her new conception of music, Bj\u00f6rk rolls out a programme of music workshops for children in school around the world (footage from a workshop in Buenos Aires is shown) which, as Swinton informs, is now a standard part of the music curriculum in Iceland. Bj\u00f6rk confesses that she always dreamt about running a music school and that she considers this project her music school. After one year from the first show in Manchester, the Biophilia Tour reaches the World Sacred Music Festival in Fes, Morocco, during which Bj\u00f6rk is seen performing \"Cosmogony\". Sacks finally states that \"music unify people at an elementary level\". The documentary ends with a final conversation between Bj\u00f6rk and Attenborough, in which the naturalist affirms:\n\n\"Music, to be most rewarding, [...] does require work, and does require concentration, does require thought, which is why your music is so challenging, because it does require thought. So much of what you do, is completely new, [and] hasn't been done by people before, and that's what's challenging about that. So, if you're very tired, I don't suggest that they put on your music. I put on your music when I really want to think about something.\"\nTo which Bj\u00f6rk blushes, and then the pair laugh together. The end credits roll to \"Cosmogony\" in the background."

        "content": "At the end of World War II, thousands of former Soviet POWs, repatriated from Germany, were sent to Siberia by Stalin, to be \u2018re-educated'. Despite being a war hero, Ignat, a disgraced Red Army locomotive driver, is sent to one such labour camp, on the edge of a dense forest, as punishment for destroying the fastest locomotive in the Soviet Union during a reckless race. \nUpon arrival at the camp, Ignat quickly establishes a reputation for devotion to the labor camp's own steam railway engine. The railway line goes no further west than the camp because a bridge was washed out just before the start of the war. On a hunch, Ignat follows the line west, swims the river at the washed out bridge, and continues down the railway line. He soon discovers an abandoned steam engine trapped on the other side when the bridge washed out. Living inside the cab is a young German woman, Elsa, surviving by hunting and gathering. Having been on her own during the past years, she frequently talks to the old locomotive, calling it \"Gustav\" after her fianc\u00e9 who was killed during the war. \nIgnat and Elsa start out fighting each other and are unable to communicate due to the language barrier. Eventually they start to work together, both in repairing the steam engine to run, and effecting makeshift repairs to the washed out bridge. They arrive back in camp with the awful looking steam engine and continue to work together repairing it.\nElsa and Ignat become isolated from camp people, Ignat for his devotion to his newly found locomotive (he paints its name \"Gustav\" on the engine in large Russian letters), and Elsa simply by hatred for Germans from the war. Camp members summon the distant political commissar, who arrives by special train. The commissar shows his brutality when he shoots and kills a Russian woman wrongfully accused of sleeping with the Germans. He locks up Elsa in a boxcar attached to his train and departs the camp. \nWhen Ignat learns Elsa has been taken away, he chases down the commissar with \"Gustav\", running on parallel tracks. Further back, the camp's main locomotive, carrying many of the camp members, is also chasing down the commissar's train, angry over the brutality they witnessed. Ignat's engine is faster, and he manages to get ahead of the commissar's train in a winter race through the woods. He stops the Commissar by cutting him off at a set of points, and knocks him out. Later, the arriving train with much of the camp personnel find the commissar and send him packing down the line on a bicycle. The final scene shows Ignat and Elsa making their escape on a railway pump car, to start a new life elsewhere in the Soviet Union."

Unhappy in his marriage and the monotony and meaninglessness of his life, he is frequently unfaithful and considers women to be of \"a lower race\".  While vacationing in Yalta, he sees a young woman walking along the seafront with her little Pomeranian, and endeavors to make her acquaintance. The lady, Anna Sergeyevna, is also unhappily married and vacationing without her husband. Anna and Dmitri soon commence an affair, and spend most of their time together, often walking and taking drives to the nearby village of Oreanda. Though she is expecting her husband to come to Yalta, he eventually sends word for her to come home, saying that something is wrong with his eyes.  Gurov sees her off at the station. As they part, both feel that they will never see each other again, and thus their affair is over.\nReturning to Moscow, to his loveless marriage and his daily routine, working by day and socializing by night, Gurov expects to soon forget young Anna, but to his surprise, her memory haunts him. Unexpectedly, he falls deeply in love for the first time, after many affairs and just as he is approaching middle age. He feels that he must see Anna, despite the obvious complications. On the ruse of going to St. Petersburg to attend to personal business, he sets off to Anna's hometown to find her.  Learning the location of the family's residence from a hotel porter, he finds the house, only to realize that it would be unwise to intrude. In despair, he rationalizes that Anna has probably forgotten him and found someone else, and heads back to his hotel.\nIn the evening, he remembers having seen a sign earlier in the day announcing the opening performance of The Geisha. Reasoning that Anna and her husband might attend, he goes to the theater. The couple enters and he watches intently. When the husband goes out for a smoke during the first interval, Gurov greets Anna, who is bewildered and runs from him. After following her through the theater, he confronts her and she confides that she has been thinking of him constantly.  Frightened, she begs him to leave and promises to see him in Moscow.\n\nAnna makes excuses to travel to Moscow, telling her husband that she is going there to see a doctor, which he \"believes and does not believe\". The pair are now fully aware that for the first time in their lives they have actually fallen in love, and they both wonder how they might overcome the many challenges that face them and achieve their fervent wish to spend their lives together. They desperately try to come up with a plan, but the story ends without offering a resolution:\"They \u2026 talked of how to avoid the necessity for secrecy, for deception, for living in different towns and not seeing each other for long stretches of time \u2026 and it was clear to both of them that \u2026 the most complicated and difficult part of their journey was just beginning.\""

When touched by love, we know the world in a different way. Love changes the inner landscape, too. Under the pressure of love, Gurov looks inside himself and sees someone he has not known before, someone capable of feelings that he barely knew existed.\"\nNabokov wrote about the unconventional ending:\"All the traditional rules ... have been broken in this wonderful short story ... no problem, no regular climax, no point at the end.

        "content": "Kid A is the fourth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 2 October 2000 by Parlophone. It was recorded with their producer, Nigel Godrich, in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire. \nAfter the stress of promoting Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, the songwriter, Thom Yorke, wanted to depart from rock music. Drawing influence from electronic music, ambient music, krautrock, jazz and 20th-century classical music, Radiohead used instruments such as modular synthesisers, the ondes Martenot, brass and strings. They processed guitar sounds, incorporated samples and loops, and manipulated their recordings with software. Yorke wrote impersonal and abstract lyrics, cutting up phrases and assembling them at random.\nIn a departure from industry practice, Radiohead released no singles and conducted few interviews and photoshoots. Instead, they released short animations and became one of the first major acts to use the internet for promotion. Bootlegs of early performances were shared on filesharing services, and Kid A was leaked before release. In 2000, Radiohead toured Europe in a custom-built tent without corporate logos.\nKid A debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and became Radiohead's first number-one album on the Billboard 200 in the US, where it sold more than 207,000 copies in its first week. Its new sound divided listeners, and some dismissed it as pretentious, deliberately obscure or derivative. However, at the end of the decade, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times ranked it the greatest album of the 2000s, and in 2020 Rolling Stone ranked it number 20 on its updated list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Like OK Computer, Kid A won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It was certified platinum in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the US and the UK.\nA second album of material from the sessions, Amnesiac, was released eight months later. Kid A Mnesia, an anniversary reissue compiling Kid A, Amnesiac and previously unreleased material, was released in 2021."

        "content": "Following the critical and commercial success of their 1997 album OK Computer, the members of Radiohead suffered burnout. The songwriter, Thom Yorke, became ill, describing himself as \"a complete fucking mess ... completely unhinged\". He was troubled by new acts he felt were imitating Radiohead and became hostile to the music media. He told The Observer: \"I always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with things, and I sort of felt like that the thing that helped me deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and I was simply doing its bidding. And I couldn't handle that.\"Yorke suffered from writer's block and could not finish writing songs on guitar. He became disillusioned with the \"mythology\" of rock music, feeling the genre had \"run its course\". He began to listen almost exclusively to the electronic music of artists signed to the record label Warp, such as Aphex Twin and Autechre. Yorke said: \"It was refreshing because the music was all structures and had no human voices in it. But I felt just as emotional about it as I'd ever felt about guitar music.\" He liked the idea of his voice being used as an instrument rather than having a leading role, and wanted to focus on sounds and textures instead of traditional songwriting.Yorke bought a house in Cornwall and spent his time walking the cliffs and drawing, restricting his musical activity to playing the grand piano he had recently bought. \"Everything in Its Right Place\" was the first song he wrote. He described himself as a \"shit piano player\", with little knowledge of electronic instruments: \"I remember this Tom Waits quote from years ago, that what keeps him going as a songwriter is his complete ignorance of the instruments he's using. So everything's a novelty. That's one of the reasons I wanted to get into computers and synths, because I didn't understand how the fuck they worked. I had no idea what ADSR meant.\"The guitarist Ed O'Brien had hoped Radiohead's fourth album would comprise short, melodic guitar songs, but Yorke said: \"There was no chance of the album sounding like that. I'd completely had it with melody. I just wanted rhythm. All melodies to me were pure embarrassment.\" The bassist, Colin Greenwood, said: \"We felt we had to change everything. There were other guitar bands out there trying to do similar things. We had to move on.\""

        "content": "In the late 1990s, Radiohead began building their own studio in Oxfordshire. Yorke planned to use it as the German band Can had used their studio in Cologne, recording everything they played and then editing it. As the studio would not be complete until late 1999, Radiohead began work in Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris, in January 1999.Radiohead worked with the OK Computer producer Nigel Godrich and no deadline. Yorke, who had the greatest control, was still facing writer's block. His new songs were incomplete, and some consisted of little more than sounds or rhythms; few had clear verses or choruses. Yorke's lack of lyrics created problems, as these had provided points of reference and inspiration for his bandmates in the past.The group struggled with Yorke's new direction. According to Godrich, Yorke did not communicate much, and according to Yorke, Godrich \"didn't understand why, if we had such a strength in one thing, we would want to do something else\". The lead guitarist, Jonny Greenwood, feared \"awful art-rock nonsense just for its own sake\". His brother, Colin, did not enjoy Yorke's Warp influences, finding them \"really cold\". The other band members were unsure of how to contribute, and considered leaving. O'Brien said: \"It's scary \u2013 everyone feels insecure. I'm a guitarist and suddenly it's like, well, there are no guitars on this track, or no drums.\"Radiohead experimented with electronic instruments including modular synthesisers and the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument similar to a theremin, and used software such as Pro Tools and Cubase to edit and manipulate their recordings. They found it difficult to use electronic instruments collaboratively. According to Yorke, \"We had to develop ways of going off into corners and build things on whatever sequencer, synthesiser or piece of machinery we would bring to the equation and then integrate that into the way we would normally work.\" O'Brien began using sustain units on his guitar, which allow notes to be sustained infinitely, combined with looping and delay effects to create synthesiser-like sounds.In March, Radiohead moved to Medley Studios in Copenhagen for two weeks, which were unproductive. The sessions produced about 50 reels of tape, each containing 15 minutes of music, with nothing finished. In April, Radiohead resumed recording in a mansion in Batsford Park, Gloucestershire. The lack of deadline and the number of incomplete ideas made it hard to focus, and the group held tense meetings. They agreed to disband if they could not agree on an album worth releasing. In July, O'Brien began keeping an online diary of Radiohead's progress.Radiohead moved to their new studio in Oxfordshire in September. In November, Radiohead held a live webcast from their studio, featuring a performance of new music and a DJ set. By 2000, six songs were complete. In January, at Godrich's suggestion, Radiohead split into two groups: one would generate a sound or sequence without acoustic instruments such as guitars or drums, and the other would develop it. Though the experiment produced no finished songs, it helped convince O'Brien of the potential of electronic instruments.On 19 April 2000, Yorke wrote on Radiohead's website that they had finished recording. Having completed over 20 songs, Radiohead considered releasing a double album, but felt the material was too dense, and decided that a series of EPs would be a \"copout\". Instead, they saved half the songs for their next album, Amnesiac, released the following year. Yorke said Radiohead split the work into two albums because \"they cancel each other out as overall finished things. They come from two different places.\" He observed that deciding the track list was not just a matter of choosing the best songs, as \"you can put all the best songs in the world on a record and they'll ruin each other\". He cited the later Beatles albums as examples of effective sequencing: \"How in the hell can you have three different versions of 'Revolution' on the same record and get away with it? I thought about that sort of thing.\" Agreeing on the track list created arguments, and O'Brien said the band came close to breaking up: \"That felt like it could go either way, it could break ... But we came in the next day and it was resolved.\" The album was mastered by Chris Blair in Abbey Road Studios, London."

Donwood painted on large canvases with knives and sticks, then photographed the paintings and manipulated them with Photoshop. While working on the artwork, Yorke and Donwood became \"obsessed\" with the Worldwatch Institute website, which was full of \"scary statistics about ice caps melting, and weather patterns changing\"; this inspired them to use an image of a mountain range as the cover art. Donwood said he saw the mountains as \"some sort of cataclysmic power\".Donwood was inspired by a photograph taken during the Kosovo War depicting a square metre of snow full of the \"detritus of war\", such as military equipment and cigarette stains. He said: \"I was upset by it in a way war had never upset me before. It felt like it was happening in my street.\" The red swimming pool on the album spine and disc was inspired by the 1988 graphic novel Brought to Light by Alan Moore and Bill Sienkiewicz, in which the number of people killed by state terrorism is measured in swimming pools filled with blood. Donwood said this image \"haunted\" him during the recording of the album, calling it \"a symbol of looming danger and shattered expectations\". Yorke and Donwood cited a Paris exhibition of paintings by David Hockney as another influence.Yorke and Donwood made many versions of the album cover, with different pictures and different titles in different typefaces. Unable to pick one, they taped them to cupboards of the studio kitchen and went to bed. According to Donwood, the choice the next day \"was obvious\". In October 2021, Yorke and Donwood curated an exhibition of Kid A artwork at Christie's headquarters in London."

Though \"Optimistic\" and promotional copies of other tracks received radio play, Radiohead released no singles from the album. Yorke said this was to avoid the stress of publicity, which he had struggled with on OK Computer, rather than for artistic reasons. He later said he regretted the decision, feeling it meant much of the early judgement of the album came from critics.Radiohead were careful to present Kid A as a cohesive work rather than a series of separate tracks. Rather than give EMI executives their own copies, they had them listen to the album in its entirety on a bus from Hollywood to Malibu. Rob Gordon, the vice president of marketing at Capitol Records, the American subsidiary of Radiohead's label EMI, praised the album but said promoting it would be a \"business challenge\".No advance copies of Kid A were circulated, but it was played under controlled conditions for critics and fans. On September 5, 2000, it was played for the public for the first time at the IMAX theatre in Lincoln Square, Manhattan. Promotional copies of Kid A came with stickers prohibiting broadcast before September 19. At midnight, it was played in its entirety by the London radio station Xfm. MTV2, KROQ, and WXRK also played the album.Rather than agree to a standard magazine photoshoot for Q, Radiohead supplied digitally altered portraits, with their skin smoothed, their irises recoloured, and Yorke's drooping eyelid removed. The Q editor Andrew Harrison described the images as \"aggressively weird to the point of taking the piss ... All five of Radiohead had been given the aspect of gawking aliens.\" Yorke said: \"I'd like to see them try to put these pictures on a poster.\" Q projected the images onto the Houses of Parliament, placed them on posters and billboards in the London Underground and on the Old Street Roundabout, and had them printed on key rings, mugs and mouse mats, to \"turn Radiohead back into a product\"."

It is certified platinum in the UK, Australia, Canada, France, Japan and the US."

        "content": "Kid A was widely anticipated. Spin described it as the most anticipated rock record since Nirvana's In Utero. According to Andrew Harrison, the editor of Q, journalists expected it to provide more of the \"rousing, cathartic, lots-of-guitar, Saturday-night-at-Glastonbury big future rock moments\" of OK Computer. Months before its release, Pat Blashill of Melody Maker wrote: \"If there's one band that promises to return rock to us, it's Radiohead.\"After Kid A had been played for critics, many bemoaned the lack of guitar, the obscured vocals and the unconventional song structures. Some called it \"a commercial suicide note\". The Guardian wrote of the \"muted electronic hums, pulses and tones\", predicting that it would confuse listeners. In Mojo, Jim Irvin wrote that \"upon first listen, Kid A is just awful ... Too often it sounds like the fragments that they began the writing process with \u2013 a loop, a riff, a mumbled line of text, have been set in concrete and had other, lesser ideas piled on top.\" The Guardian critic Adam Sweeting wrote that \"even listeners raised on krautrock or Ornette Coleman will find Kid A a mystifying experience\", and that it pandered to \"the worst cliches\" about Radiohead's \"relentless miserabilism\". Several critics found the free jazz of \"The National Anthem\" discordant and unpleasant.Several critics felt Kid A was pretentious or deliberately obscure. The Irish Times bemoaned the lack of conventional song structures and panned the album as \"deliberately abstruse, wilfully esoteric and wantonly unfathomable ... The only thing challenging about Kid A is the very real challenge to your attention span.\" In the New Yorker, the novelist Nick Hornby wrote that it was \"morbid proof that this sort of self-indulgence results in a weird kind of anonymity rather than something distinctive and original\". The Melody Maker critic Mark Beaumont called it \"tubby, ostentatious, self-congratulatory, look-ma-I-can-suck-my-own-cock whiny old rubbish ... About 60 songs were started that no one had a bloody clue how to finish.\" Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described it as \"self-consciously awkward and bloody-minded, the noise made by a band trying so hard to make a 'difficult' album that they felt it beneath them to write any songs\". Rolling Stone published a piece mocking Kid A as humourless, derivative and lacking in songs: \"Because it was decided that Radiohead were Important and Significant last time around, no one can accept the album as the crackpot art project it so obviously is.\"Some critics felt Kid A was unoriginal. In the New York Times, Howard Hampton dismissed Radiohead as a \"rock composite\" and wrote that Kid A \"recycles Pink Floyd's dark-side-of-the-moon solipsism to Me-Decade perfection\". Beaumont said Radiohead were \"simply ploughing furrows dug by DJ Shadow and Brian Eno before them\". The Irish Times felt the ambient elements were inferior to Eno's 1978 album Music For Airports and its \"scary\" elements inferior to Scott Walker's 1995 album Tilt. Select wrote: \"What do they want for sounding like the Aphex Twin circa 1993, a medal?\" In an NME editorial, James Oldham wrote that the electronic influences were \"mired in compromise\", with Radiohead still operating as a rock band, and concluded: \"Time will judge it. But right now, Kid A has the ring of a lengthy, over-analysed mistake.\" Rob Mitchell, the co-founder of Warp, felt Kid A represented \"an honest interpretation of [Warp] influences\" and was not \"gratuitously\" electronic. He predicted it might one day be seen in the same way as David Bowie's 1977 album Low, which alienated some Bowie fans but was later acclaimed. In a retrospective, the Rolling Stone journalist Rob Sheffield wrote that the \"mastery of Warp-style electronic effects\" had appeared \"clumsy and dated\" at the time of Kid A's release.AllMusic gave Kid A a favourable review, but wrote that it \"never is as visionary or stunning as OK Computer, nor does it really repay the intensive time it demands in order for it to sink in\". The NME was also positive, but described some songs as \"meandering\" and \"anticlimactic\", and concluded: \"For all its feats of brinkmanship, the patently magnificent construct called Kid A betrays a band playing one-handed just to prove they can, scared to commit itself emotionally.\" In Rolling Stone, David Fricke called Kid A \"a work of deliberately inky, often irritating obsession ... But this is pop, a music of ornery, glistening guile and honest ache, and it will feel good under your skin once you let it get there.\"Spin said Kid A was \"not the act of career suicide or feat of self-indulgence it will be castigated as\", and predicted that fans would recognise it as Radiohead's best and \"bravest\" album. Billboard described it as \"an ocean of unparalleled musical depth\" and \"the first truly groundbreaking album of the 21st century\". The music critic Robert Christgau wrote that Kid A was \"an imaginative, imitative variation on a pop staple: sadness made pretty\". The Village Voice called it \"oblique oblique oblique ... Also incredibly beautiful.\" Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork gave Kid A a perfect score, calling it \"cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike\". He concluded that Radiohead \"must be the greatest band alive, if not the best since you know who\". One of the first Kid A reviews published online, it helped popularise Pitchfork and became notorious for its \"obtuse\" writing.Radiohead denied that they had set out to create \"difficult\" music. Jonny Greenwood argued that the tracks were short and melodic, and suggested that \"people basically want their hands held through 12 'Mull Of Kintyre's\". Yorke said Radiohead had not attempted to alienate or confound, but that their musical interests had changed. He recalled that they had been \"white as a sheet\" before early performances on the Kid A tour, thinking they had been \"absolutely trashed\". At the same time, the reaction motivated them: \"There was a sense of a fight to convince people, which was actually really exciting.\" Yorke said Radiohead felt \"incredibly vindicated and happy\" after Kid A reached number one in the US.At Metacritic, which aggregates ratings from critics, Kid A has a score of 80 based on 24 reviews, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\". It was named one of the year's best albums by publications including the Wire, Record Collector, Spin, NME and the Village Voice. At the 2001 Grammy Awards, Kid A was nominated for Album of the Year and won for Best Alternative Album."

        "content": "In the years following its release, Kid A attracted acclaim. In 2005, Pitchfork wrote that it had \"challenged and confounded\" Radiohead's audience, and subsequently \"transformed into an intellectual symbol of sorts ... Owning it became 'getting it'; getting it became 'anointing it'.\" In 2015, Sheffield likened Radiohead's change in style to Bob Dylan's controversial move to rock music, writing that critics now hesitated to say they had disliked it at the time. He described Kid A as the \"defining moment in the Radiohead legend\". A year later, Billboard argued that Kid A was the first album since Bowie's Low to have moved \"rock and electronic music forward in such a mature fashion\". In an article for Kid A's 20th anniversary, the Quietus suggested that the negative reviews had been motivated by rockism, the tendency among music critics to venerate rock music over other genres.In a 2011 Guardian article about his critical Melody Maker review, Beaumont wrote that though his opinion had not changed, \"Kid A's status as a cultural cornerstone has proved me, if not wrong, then very much in the minority ... People whose opinions I trust claim it to be their favourite album ever.\" In 2014, Brice Ezell of PopMatters wrote that Kid A is \"more fun to think and write about than it is to actually listen to\" and a \"far less compelling representation of the band's talents than The Bends and OK Computer\". In 2016, Dorian Lynskey wrote in The Guardian: \"At times, Kid A is dull enough to make you fervently wish that they'd merged the highlights with the best bits of the similarly spotty Amnesiac ... Yorke had given up on coherent lyrics so one can only guess at what he was worrying about.\"Grantland credited Kid A for pioneering the use of internet to stream and promote music, writing: \"For many music fans of a certain age and persuasion, Kid A was the first album experienced primarily via the internet \u2013 it's where you went to hear it, read the reviews, and argue about whether it was a masterpiece ... Listen early, form an opinion quickly, state it publicly, and move on to the next big record by the official release date. In that way, Kid A invented modern music culture as we know it.\" In his 2005 book Killing Yourself to Live, critic Chuck Klosterman interpreted Kid A as a prediction of the September 11 attacks.Speaking at Radiohead's induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2019, David Byrne of Talking Heads, one of Radiohead's formative influences, said: \"What was really weird and very encouraging was that [Kid A] was popular. It was a hit! It proved to me that the artistic risk paid off and music fans sometimes are not stupid.\" In 2020, Billboard wrote that the success of the \"challenging\" Kid A established Radiohead as \"heavy hitters in the business for the long run\"."

It was acquired by the Louis-Dreyfus group in 1931 and then by the industrialist Jean Prouvost in 1938. Under Prouvost the magazine expanded its focus beyond sports, to a format reminiscent of Life: Le Match de la vie (\"The Match of Life\") and then Match, l'hebdomadaire de l'actualit\u00e9 mondiale (\"Match, the weekly of world news\"). Following the outbreak of World War II it became Match de la guerre (\"Match of War\") in October 1939. Selling for 2 francs a copy, it reached a circulation of 1.45 million by November.  Publication was halted on 6 June 1940, during the Battle of France.\nThe magazine was relaunched in 1949 with a new name, Paris Match. The magazine temporarily ceased its publication between 18 May and 15 June 1968 upon the call for a strike by the Syndicat du Livre, the French printers' union.In 1976, Daniel Filipacchi purchased the ailing Paris Match. It continues to be one of France's most successful and influential magazines. It is published weekly and is now part of Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias, which is itself owned by the Lagard\u00e8re Group.On occasion, Paris Match has sold more than one million copies worldwide when covering major events, such as the first flight by a French astronaut, Patrick Baudry, aboard the U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery in June 1985. Beno\u00eet Clair, a senior writer for Paris Match, was the first journalist allowed to join the shuttle crew members from training until the departure for the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. A series of reports on the training was published in Paris Match on 22 April 1985, 17 June 1985 and 20 January 1986.As of 1996 the magazine has adopted an independent political stance.In February 2024, it is publicly disclosed that the luxury brand LVMH is in talks to purchase Paris Match from the media conglomerate Lagardere SA."

        "content": "As with 1980's Ace of Spades, recording commenced with producer Vic Maile at his Jackson's Studio in Rickmansworth in 1981. Motorhead was enjoying their greatest commercial success at the time, having had their live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith debut at No. 1 on the UK charts. A break in recording for the band to play some November and December dates with Tank was followed by Clarke producing Tank's debut album with help from Will Reid Dick. Soon after, Maile left the Mot\u00f6rhead project, and there are conflicting explanations as to why. One is that Clarke was unhappy with the Maile produced sessions and decided that the album should be recorded themselves, although Lemmy lamented at the time that:\n\n\"It's a shame to have lost Vic in a way because I thought it was successful.\"\nHowever, in the Mot\u00f6rhead documentary The Guts and the Glory, Clarke insists that drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor refused to work with the producer after Maile got him an unsatisfactory drum sound, stating:\n\n\"[...] and then one day Phil turned to me and said, 'Listen Eddie, why don't you do it?'  And I said, 'Man, I don't wanna do it, I'm playing on the record'... I swear to God, I was reluctant as fuck.\"\nIn the same film Lemmy states:\n\n\"I was pissed off 'cause we let Eddie produce it. I wasn't at the time, though. Fair play. But it became obvious after it was released \u2013 I sort of sobered up and realized it was garbage, most of it. And there's at least three songs on there that weren't even finished. We just finished them in the studio, you know, like cobbled it together. It just was a substandard album. But the trouble is how do you follow a live album that went straight in at #1? There's nothing you can do.\"\nThe album was recorded during the best part of late January and February 1982 at Morgan Studios and Ramport Studios in London, with Clarke producing and Dick engineering. Struggling to think of a name for the title track for the album, Lemmy remembered the time the band had performed live under the name Iron Fist and the Hordes from Hell for contractual reasons (a subsequent album What's Words Worth? was released of that event), and decided this was an apt name for this project. The name was eventually shortened to simply Iron Fist."

It's very hard not to.\"\nThe band undertook a UK tour from 17 March to 12 April with support from Tank. This was to be the first tour to drop the bomber lighting rig, with Lemmy feeling that they had \"to do something new sooner or later\" despite it being \"the best show I've ever seen in my life\". The rig was replaced by a gigantic iron fist that was supposed to unfold its hand but, as Lemmy explained to Uncut's John Robinson in 2015, it malfunctioned and made a \"rude gesture\" to the crowd. The band continued touring to promote the album, visiting North America in May and June, Japan at the end of June, and, after some summer festival appearances, mainland Europe in October and November.\nThe first date of the North American tour, 12 May at C.N.E. Coliseum (now Ricoh Coliseum) in Toronto, was filmed and subsequently released on video as Live in Toronto and later as the bonus disc of the deluxe edition of the CD. In his 2002 autobiography White Line Fever, Lemmy recalls that at the Toronto show:\n\n\"Eddie was terrible and so was I - I got cramp halfway through the show and couldn't play.\"\nPromotion for the album went as far as the May 1982 edition of Rennbahn Express, an Austrian magazine, which included a free flexidisc with excerpts from \"Iron Fist\", \"Sex and Outrage\", \"Don't Let 'em Grind You Down\", and \"Loser\". Lemmy is interviewed by Robert Reumann in English and is overdubbed with a German translation. The release of the album prompted Bronze/Mercury in Canada to issue The Complete Mot\u00f6rhead Kit, which featured a limited-edition 12-inch vinyl containing \"Iron Fist\", \"Too Late, Too Late\", \"Remember Me, I'm Gone\", \"Ace of Spades\" and \"Mot\u00f6rhead\" (from the No Sleep 'til Hammersmith album), plus a tour programme, a tour poster, and an embroidered patch of the band's logo."

        "content": "After the second date on 14 May at New York's Palladium, Clarke left the band, his replacement being former Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson with the tour recommencing a week later on 21 May in Detroit. Bad feelings between Kilmister and Clarke had been simmering for a while, but the breaking point came when Lemmy decided to record a cover of the Tammy Wynette country classic \"Stand By Your Man\" with Wendy O. Williams and the Plasmatics. Asked to play on the single, Clarke quit the band. Lemmy reflected on the guitarist's departure in his 2002 memoir:\n\n\"Actually, Eddie used to leave the band about every two months, but this time it just so happened that we didn't ask him back.  We didn't try to persuade him, which is why he stayed away - that surprised him a bit.  But we were just tired of him because he was always freaking out and he was drinking a lot back then.  He's become much better now since he stopped... Looking back - and I must say, hindsight is 20/20 - it was good for us that we fell apart when we did.  We wouldn't have been going now if we had carried on getting more and more famous.  We would have wound up a bunch of twats with houses in the country and gotten divorced from each other.  So it was just as well, I think, for Mot\u00f6rhead's morale overall.  It's important for a band to be hungry because that is the motivation that makes all bands work.  And if anyone knows about being hungry for long periods of time, it's me.\"\nLemmy reiterated in 2000 that Iron Fist was:\n\n\"[...] bad, inferior to anything else we've ever done. Having Eddie produce it was a mistake that even he would now probably admit to... we weren't ready to do another album, I don't care what anybody says.\"\nClarke maintains in The Guts and the Glory:\n\n\"[...] it wasn't so much the album, I think it was the attitude the album was made [with] was what made it not good. For me, whenever I play it, I can feel it's not quite right... The songs would'a been better had we been working as a unit.\""

The rewritten version met with her approval and has become something of a fan favourite.\nThe song itself deals with the need to overcome the prejudices of skin colour. Ursull sings, \"when someone talks to me about skin colour / I have the blues which sends shivers down my spine / I feel as if I'm in a tale by Edgar Allan Poe\". That said, she does not believe in relinquishing her connection to Africa entirely (\"Africa, my love, I have you in my skin\"), but admits that she faces difficulties in a white society (\"we, the blacks / we're a few millions, a dime a dozen\").\nMusically, the song features an accordion as well as the synthesiser effects starting to appear at the contest in the early 1990s. The song is in triple metre, with the verses following an unusual phrasing of seven triplets per phrase,  and the chorus with a more conventional eight triplets per phrase.\nIt was succeeded as French representative at the 1991 contest by Amina with \"Le Dernier qui a parl\u00e9...\"."

It was Verdi's penultimate opera, first performed at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan, on 5 February 1887.\nThe composer was reluctant to write anything new after the success of Aida in 1871, and he retreated into retirement. It took his Milan publisher Giulio Ricordi the next ten years, first to encourage the revision of Verdi's 1857 Simon Boccanegra by introducing Boito as librettist and then to begin the arduous process of persuading and cajoling Verdi to see Boito's completed libretto for Otello in July/August 1881. However, the process of writing the first drafts of the libretto and the years of their revision, with Verdi all along not promising anything, dragged on. It wasn't until 1884, five years after the first drafts of the libretto, that composition began, with most of the work finishing in late 1885. When it finally premiered in Milan on 5 February 1887, it proved to be a resounding success, and further stagings of Otello soon followed at leading theatres throughout Europe and America."

        "content": "Brothers (Chinese: \u5144\u5f1f; pinyin: Xi\u014dngd\u00ec) is the longest novel written by the Chinese novelist Yu Hua, in total of 76 chapters, separately published in 2005 for the part 1 (of the first 26 chapters) and in 2006 for part 2 (of the rest 50 chapters) by Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House. This was Yu Hua's first novel after a decade of dormancy from writing and publishing works. It has over 180 thousand characters in Chinese, more than the 100 thousand characters that were originally planned for the book. It intertwines tragedy and comedy, and Yu Hua himself admits that the novel is personally his favorite literary work. Brothers was a new realm of literature for Yu Hua, with the novel often being described as extremely crude and expletive. Brothers has experienced great success with nearly 1 million copies sold in China. By 2019, Yu Hua's works had been published in 38 countries and translated into 35 different languages. This success may be contributed to his success publicity tour to gain attraction towards the novel after his hiatus from writing. While reception among Chinese critics was generally negative, the novel was shortlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize and awarded France's Prix Courrier International in 2008. It was translated into English by Eileen Cheng-yin Chow and Carlos Rojas in 2009, a couple from the Middle Eastern department at Duke University.The story of the novel revolves around the step-brotherhood between protagonists Baldy Li and Song Gang. Their life, both absurd and tragic, throughout China's history from the 1960s to the early period of Chinese Economic Reform serves as the main plot. The division of the novel into two parts is contextually on the basis of the death of Li Lan, the biological mother of Baldy Li and the step-mother of Song Gang. The first part primarily focuses on their childhood, especially during the Cultural Revolution with the collapse of their reorganized family and the tragedy of Song Fanping, the biological father of Song Gang and the step-father of Baldy Li. The second part  focuses on their adulthood with different life trajectories, especially during the early period of Chinese Economic Reform that formulates the mixture of absurdity and tragedy."

        "content": "As shown in the translator's preface, even though Brothers was published in 2005 and 2006, Yu Hua \"originally conceived of the idea for the novel as early as 1995\". The process of his writing was not well-off at the beginning. However, during his seven-month trip to the United States and France in 2003, he was \"inspired\" to go back to the project while China was stuck in the \"beauty-pageant fever\". The \"Miss World competition\", \"Tourism Queen International pageant\", \"National Contest of the Beauty of the Gray-headed for contestants over fifty-five\", and \"Miss Artificial Beauty pageant for plastic surgery recipients\" are representative of the trend of absurdity in China that encouraged Yu Hua for the continuation of the novel that is of the reality of absurdity. Turns out, the reality of absurdity is demonstrated in the novel, especially in Part 2 with a fictional event called \"National Virgin Beauty Competition\".Yu Hua had expressed in an interview with Zhang Qinghua that he wanted to express some level of chaos in Brothers, which had characterized his writing throughout the 1980s to the present. The Cultural Revolution plays a major role in the novel, particularly in Part 1. The brothers have to navigate their way through the chaotic times of the political movement that happened in this time period. Yu Hua himself came of age during the Cultural Revolution. He said in the interview, \"The Cultural Revolution was my formative experience, from the age of seven to seventeen, which of course would leave a significant impact\". His view of violence also heavily influenced the writing of the book. He mentioned that the scene where Song Fanping - one of the main characters in the novel - was being beaten to death, was influenced by his own witness of an individual being beaten to death by the head of the revolutionary committee. The background of the author and of the Cultural Revolution with violence is significant because much of what happens in the book reflects the chaos that accompanied it."

        "content": "Violence\nYu Hua revisits themes of death, violence, and family that he has touched on in his earlier works. There are several other themes that are apparent throughout Brothers, a prominent theme would be suffering, which is prevalent in Baldy Li's early life, especially with all of his misfortunes that both of his parents and his stepfather died when he was very young. This also demonstrates how it is a novel of survival, as Baldy Li and his family initially came from nothing, forcing Baldy Li to fight for his success as an entrepreneur. It is also considered a coming of age novel as it outlines Baldy Li's life from his early childhood to his later life. There is also love woven throughout the story, not just romantic love but also brotherly and parental love. According to Hua Li, the author Yu Hua has a reoccurring trend of including premature death for his characters.\nApathy\nThe Cultural Revolution seems to be a close friend of Yu Hua for his novelistic creation. In Part 1, the death, violence, and tragedy are written in relation to the well-known political movements of the 60s to 70s. However, Yu Hua, instead of depicting the cruelty of the movement itself, demonstrates more about relentless humanity during the movement. \"They are not human!\", \"How can people be this vicious?\" - says Mama Su as the character who witnesses Song Fanping's death - might represent what Yu Hua wants to point out here. That said, Yu Hua incarnates as Mama Su, to lash out the ruthlessness of people (human nature) during the Cultural Revolution.\nFarce\nFarce is massively depicted in the novel, especially in Part 2. Some novelistic events such as the lawsuit between Baldy Li and the women with whom he slept, the Virgin Beauty Competition with the hymen economy, and Song Gang's breast surgery with the goal of selling the boobs bust-enhancing cream are all farce. The events of farce can be seen as the demonstration of absurdity, and the absurdity is the basis of the real-world scenario. For instance, Yu Hua's depiction of the Virgin Beauty Competition was inspired by the real-life farce of \"beauty-pageant fever\" during China's early opening-up. This is to say, the novel of massive farce is the combination of both reality and absurdity to demonstrate the distorted and money-oriented human nature during the early period of China's opening up.Negative Portrayals of China & Politics\nYu has not been shy in his dissent for China's policies and corruption, even admitting \"I stipulate in all my contracts that my manuscripts can't be touched editorially; not a word can be taken out. That's because there's a lot of politically sensitive material in there.\" Much of his distaste is masked in his novels through literary devices such as understatement, humour, inversion, self-mockery, ambivalent satire and subtle irony. For example, Baldy Li mimics a party secretary, in order to borrow the Chinese Communist Party's organizational system in running his business."

This is an alternative to how Yu Hua's works often got translated as the English version would commonly be published after the European languages, e.g. French, Italian, German were released. The translation from Chinese to English for the English version of Yu Hua's Brothers was a dual effort from Eileen Cheng-yin Chow & Carlos Rojas, with Chow translating part I and Rojas part II, then revising their counterparts work. The story remains consistent with a singular narrative voice, which does not change back and forth between the two translators. The decision to have Eileen Cheng-yin Chow & Carlos Rojas translate the novel from Chinese to English, was due to Yu Hua being unable to translate the novel himself because of a family situation which arose in the period succeeding the Chinese editions publication."

That's because there's a lot of politically sensitive material in there.\" The violent nature of his novels as sparked the \"Yu Hua xianxiang\" or the Yu Hua Phenomenon, as postmodern narratives begin to display cruelty and descriptive gore. Inversely, the novel managed to receive critical acclaim from English speaking countries, after being released in January 2009.Between April 2008 and January 2009, less than a year after publication, Yu Hua's Brothers has amassed more than fifty review from newspapers, radio and television programs, in addition to internet sites which ranged from brief to extensive. All of which proclaiming the novel as \"exceptional\".Positive Commentary in the Eyes of Chinese Reviewers\n\"Brothers seems to be filled with vulgar language, yet it is indeed an artistic expression combined with human beings' extreme depression and indulgence\" \u2013 by Hong Zhigang\n\"...Brothers...is an exact and excellent example of realism, unfolding before readers the reality both straightforwardly and euphemistically\" \u2013 by Chen Sihe (Professor of Literature at Fudan University)David Barboza of The New York Times noted in September 2006 that while many in China had panned the novel, others had \"praised the work as a compelling picture of an increasingly materialistic, self-indulgent and even unhinged society. 'I basically disagree with the critics,' said Liu Kang, a professor of Chinese cultural studies at Duke University. 'This is a tremendous book. And Yu Hua is really one of the best Chinese contemporary writers.'\" In addition to this, despite the harsh criticism of the novel in China, it was received exceptionally well in France.Positive Commentary in the Eyes of Anglophone Reviewers\nIn the eyes of Anglophone reviewers, Brothers is praised as \"a masterful novel\" with the \"combination of broad caricature and earnest realism, vulgarity and pointed satire\" via \"boundless imagination\", \"tremendous narrative technique\", \"and Yu Hua's flair for the macabre\". To make a long story short, the subject matter, the writing technique, and the plot imagination of the novel are all laudable. In Yubin Quan's  analysis of the Anglophone reviews, found that most commentary was fixated on the commentary towards the Cultural Revolution, rather than the violence often depicted in Yu Hua's novels.\nNew York Times author Jess row describes part one of the novel as a \"sentimental-family-cum-epic romance\" while the second novel delves into \"a broad historical satire.\"Negative Commentary in General\nMost critics, whether in the eyes of Chinese or Anglophone reviewers, attack Brothers \"as vulgar, simplistic, and immoral\" with \"numerous contents...that cannot hold water\". Others condemn the novel \"as lowbrow and crass\", which is as \"rough and absurd...as a tear-jerking soap opera\" with a \"trashy, Hollywood-style portrait of the country\". The writing strategies such as \"artificial plotting\", \"hyperbolic, facetious or overemphatic tone\", and \"flat characterization\" are also criticized. Even though both Chinese and English reviewers share the similarity of criticism, Chinese critics are way more than English critics.\n\n\n== References =="

Details later emerged, partially due to Khaosod's reporting, that Lieutenant-General Chalor Kerdthes of the Royal Thai Police ordered the pair abducted and subsequently murdered after failing to extract information concerning the fate of the Saudi Blue Diamond from the pair. Initially reported by many newspapers as a roadside accident, Khaosod insisted otherwise from early on. Lieutenant-General Chalor and several other police officers were arrested, found guilty, and sentenced to death (the sentence was later reduced to 50 years of imprisonment).

Released on 12 September 1983, it is the only album the group recorded with lead vocalist Ian Gillan, best known for his work with Deep Purple. It was also the last Black Sabbath album for nine years to feature original bassist Geezer Butler and the last to feature original drummer Bill Ward, though Ward did record a studio track with the band fifteen years later on their 1998 live album Reunion. The album has received mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success upon its 1983 release, reaching No. 4 in the UK charts. The album also hit the top 40 in the United States. In July 2021, guitarist and founding member Tony Iommi confirmed that the long lost original master tapes of the album had been finally located, and that he was considering remixing the album for a future re-release."

        "content": "Following the departure of vocalist Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice in 1982, Sabbath's future was in doubt. The band switched management to Don Arden (Sharon Osbourne's father) and he suggested Ian Gillan as the new vocalist. The band had considered vocalists such as Robert Plant and David Coverdale before settling on Gillan. With Whitesnake on the verge of breaking up, Iommi was eager to form a new group with Coverdale and drummer Cozy Powell joining him and Butler, but Coverdale and Powell decided at the last minute to continue with Whitesnake. While Iommi has claimed that the band received an audition tape from a then-unknown Michael Bolton at this time, Butler claims no such thing happened and that Iommi concocted the story as \"a joke\".Iommi told Hit Parader magazine in late 1983 that Gillan was the best candidate, saying \"His shriek is legendary.\" Gillan was at first reluctant, but his manager convinced him to meet with Iommi and Butler at The Bear, a pub in Oxford. After a night of heavy drinking, Gillan officially committed to the project in February 1983. The following morning Gillan had no memory of joining the band and claimed he didn't even like Black Sabbath's music, but the deal had already been struck.The project was originally intended to be a new supergroup, and the members of the group had no intention of billing themselves as Black Sabbath. At some point after recording had been completed, Arden insisted that they use the recognizable Sabbath name, and the members were overruled. Arden had secured a sizable advance from the record company with the proviso that Gillan be involved, and they would only release the album under the Black Sabbath name. \"We thought we were doing a kind of Gillan-Iommi-Butler-Ward album\u2026\" recalled bassist Geezer Butler. \"That is the way we approached the album. When we had finished the album, we took it to the record company and they said, 'Well, here's the contract: it is going to go out as a Black Sabbath album.\"With Cozy Powell electing to remain with Coverdale in Whitesnake, Black Sabbath's longtime drummer Bill Ward was persuaded to return to the band. Ward claimed to be newly sober after leaving the band in 1980 to deal with his alcoholism and he assured Iommi and Butler that he was up to recording and touring once again. Ward began drinking at some point during the sessions and returned to Los Angeles for treatment once the album was completed, and has remained sober ever since. Ward has said that he enjoyed making the album, which remains his final studio album with the band."

        "content": "Sabbath began recording in May 1983 at Richard Branson's Manor Studio, in the Oxfordshire countryside. Engineer Robin Black had worked with the band in the mid-1970s on Sabotage and received a co-producer credit on Born Again.\nDuring recording, the band members lived at Manor Studio while Gillan chose to live outside the house, alone, in a marquee tent on the studio grounds: \"I thought he was joking, but when I arrived at the Manor I saw this marquee outside and I thought, fucking hell, he's serious. Ian had put up this big, huge tent. It had a cooking area and a bedroom and whatever else\", said Iommi. Butler said that the tent situation and Gillan's refusal to live with his new bandmates, in hindsight, likely indicated that the vocalist didn't view himself as a member of the band.\"Ian's lyrics were about sexual things or true facts, even about stuff that happened at The Manor there and then,\" Iommi said. \"They were good, but quite a departure from Geezer's and Ronnie's lyrics.\" For example, Gillan returned from a local pub one evening, took a car belonging to drummer Ward, and commenced racing around a go-cart track on the Manor Studio property. He crashed the car, which burst into flames after he escaped uninjured. He wrote the album's opening \"Trashed\" about the experience. Butler felt that Gillan's lyrics on tracks such as \"Digital Bitch\" and \"Keep It Warm\" were good, but much better suited to the musical style of Deep Purple than Black Sabbath.\"Disturbing the Priest\" was written after a rehearsal space \u2013 set up by Iommi in a small building near a local church \u2013 received noise complaints from the resident priests. \"We wanted this effect on 'Disturbing the Priest',\" recalled the guitarist, \"and Bill got this big bucket of water and he got this anvil. It was really heavy, and he'd got it hanging on a piece of rope and lower it in to get this effect: hit it and lower it in, and then lift it out again. It was a great effect, but it took hours to do.\"The band got along well, but it became apparent to all involved that Gillan's style did not quite mesh with the Sabbath sound. In 1992, he told director Martin Baker, \"I was the worst singer Black Sabbath ever had. It was totally, totally incompatible with any music they'd ever done. I didn't wear leathers, I wasn't of that image...I think the fans probably were in a total state of confusion.\" In 1992, Iommi admitted to Guitar World, \"Ian is a great singer, but he's from a completely different background, and it was difficult for him to come in and sing Sabbath material.\"\n\"I saw Ian go into the studio one day,\" Ward recalled, \"and I was fortunate and honoured, actually, to be part of a session. I watched him lay tracks on 'Keep It Warm'\u2026 I felt like Ian was Ian in that song\u2026 I watched this incredible transformation of this man that really, I felt, delicately put lyrics together. It made sense. I thought he did an excellent job. And I really dig that song too.\"\"I did some of the best drum work on that album\u2026\" Bill Ward recalled. \"On 'Disturbing the Priest', there were some polyrhythms and some counterpoint things that I was doing, and I was using at least twenty different pieces of percussion towards the end of that song\u2026 I was real proud of a lot of the work that I did. Some of it invariably got lost in the mix, but I know that it's printed on those tracks.\" Butler said that Ward began acting quite strangely during recording and was angrier than he had ever seen him. At one point the drummer began hallucinating and had to be hospitalized, and while he was there the band discovered his secret stash of vodka that he'd been consuming in secret at night. After being released from the hospital, Ward quit the band again and returned to America to sort out his issues, with his drum parts already recorded.When the band heard the final product, they were horrified at the muffled mix. In his autobiography, Iommi explains that Gillan inadvertently blew a couple of tweeters in the studio speakers by playing the backing tracks too loud and nobody noticed. \"We just thought it was a bit of a funny sound, but it went very wrong somewhere between the mix and the mastering and the pressing of that album...the sound was really dull and muffly. I didn't know about it, because we were already out on tour in Europe. By the time we heard the album, it was out and in the charts, but the sound was awful.\" Butler recalled listening to the tapes in his hotel room and being alarmed at how \"muffled and unclear\" the tracks were, but Iommi and Black assured him that the issue would be corrected during mixing. Ultimately, the issue never was corrected, with Butler lamenting years later that \"that's what happens when you don't hire a bona fide producer, like Martin Birch, to handle things.\"For all his misgivings, Gillan remembers the period fondly, stating in the Black Sabbath: 1978\u20131992 documentary, \"But by God, we had a good year...And the songs, I think, were quite good.\""

Bevan was a friend of Iommi's who knew Don Arden well, but he was ultimately not a heavy metal drummer. Following the tour, in which Gillan refused to learn the lyrics to much of the band's Osbourne-era material, this version of Black Sabbath fell apart, with Gillan and Bevan quitting.The tour was also a breaking point for Butler, who admits in the Black Sabbath: 1978\u20131992 documentary, \"I just got totally disillusioned with the whole thing and I left some time in 1984 after the Born Again tour. I just had enough of it.\" In 2015 Butler clarified to Dave Everley of Classic Rock: \"I left because my second child was born and he was having problems, so I wanted to stay with him. I told Tony I couldn't concentrate on the band anymore. But I never fell out with anybody.\" While the members all got along well enough, Butler questioned Gillan's commitment after his refusal to learn the lyrics to the band's older material, and Butler says the looming Deep Purple reunion was the deciding factor in the vocalist's decision to leave. Iommi was unhappy when Gillan told him the news, as he thought it had been a long-term arrangement. Disagreements with management also contributed to the band's dissolution."

It is based on a black-and-white photocopy of a photograph published in a 1968 magazine. Joule was said to have deliberately delivered a sub-par cover due to his involvement with and loyalty to the band's former vocalist Osbourne.Butler called the cover \"a bit sick, but (Arden) loved it, so that was that.\" Gillan told the press that he vomited when he first saw the picture. However, Iommi approved the cover, which has long been regarded as one of the worst in rock music history. Ben Mitchell of Blender called the cover \"awful\". The British magazine, Kerrang!, ranked the cover in second place, behind only the Scorpions' Lovedrive, on their list of \"10 Worst Album Sleeves in Metal/Hard Rock\". The list was based on votes from the magazine's readers. NME included the sleeve on their list of the \"29 sickest album covers ever\".

It was the highest charting Black Sabbath album in the United Kingdom since Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973), and became an American Top 40 hit. Despite this, it was the first Black Sabbath album to fall short of RIAA certification.\nThe album received mixed reviews upon its release. AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote that the album has \"gone down as one of heavy metal's all-time greatest disappointments\" and described \"Zero the Hero\", \"Hot Line\", and \"Keep It Warm\" as \"embarrassing\". Blender contributor Ben Mitchell gave the album one out of five stars and claimed that the music on Born Again was worse than its cover. Martin Charles Strong, the author of The Essential Rock Discography, wrote that it was \"an exercise in heavy-metal clich\u00e9\". However, PopMatters contributor Adrien Begrand has noted the album as \"overlooked\". The British magazine Metal Forces defined it \"a very good album\" even if \"Gillan may not be the perfect frontman for the Sabs\".Despite the overall negative reception with critics, the album remains a fan favorite. Author Martin Popoff has written that \"if any album in the history of Black Sabbath is getting a new set of horns up from metalheads here deep into the new century, it's Born Again.\" Industrial metal band Godflesh and death metal band Cannibal Corpse both have covered \"Zero the Hero\", the former appears on the Masters Of Misery - Black Sabbath: The Earache Tribute album while the latter is featured on the Hammer Smashed Face EP. Cannibal Corpse's former singer, Chris Barnes, has called Born Again his favourite Black Sabbath album. \"Zero the Hero\" has also been cited as the inspiration for the Guns N' Roses hit \"Paradise City\", and in his autobiography Iommi also suggests the Beastie Boys may have borrowed the riff from \"Hot Line\" for their hit \"(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party!)\".  Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich has called Born Again \"one of the best Black Sabbath albums\". Bill Stevenson, former drummer of Black Flag, stated the band was listening to the album around the time of My War, defining songs like \"Trashed\" and \"Disturbing the Priest\" as \"ideal\".In 1984, Ozzy Osbourne stated that the album was the \"best thing I've heard from Sabbath since the original group broke up\". Butler has pointed to \"Zero the Hero\" and \"Disturbing the Priest\" as his favorites on the album. Butler has said that while he initially felt that the poor production had spoiled Born Again, upon re-listening to it decades later \"it was a lot better than I remembered\", saying \"If the songs are good enough, you can get away with iffy production.\" He points to Iommi's riffs and says \"Ian's singing is great\". In 1992, Iommi confessed to Guitar World, \"To be honest, I didn't like some of the songs on that album, and the production was awful. We never had time to test the pressings after it was recorded, and something happened to it by the time it got released.\"\nIan Gillan expressed disappointment in the final production mix of the album, saying that although he did not break his first copy of it, \"I threw it out the window of my car. [Laughs]\" He also reflected on the touring activity with the band, \"I was with Black Sabbath for a year and I sang Ozzy Osbourne songs as well as the songs from Born Again. And I never felt right doing that. It was great \u2014 I could sing them okay \u2014 but I didn't sound like Ozzy. There was something not quite right.\"A re-mastered 'Deluxe Expanded Edition' of Born Again was released in May 2011 by Sanctuary Records. It included several live tracks from the 1983 Reading Festival originally featured on BBC Radio 1's Friday Rock Show. Though the release was remastered, it was not remixed due to the inability to locate the original master tapes, as well as Sanctuary not wanting delay the release in an effort to locate said tapes for a remix.In 2021, Tony Iommi claimed that the original master tapes, long thought lost, had been found and that he was considering remixing them for an eventual release."

        "content": "According to Iommi's autobiography, Ward began drinking again near the end of the Born Again recording sessions and returned to Los Angeles for treatment.  The band recruited Bev Bevan, who had played with The Move and ELO, for the upcoming tour in support of the new album.  Gillan had all the lyrics to the Sabbath songs written out and plastered all over the stage, explaining to Martin Baker in 1992, \"I couldn't get into my brain any of these lyrics...I cannot soak in these words.  There's no storyline. I can't relate to what they mean.\"  Gillan attempted to overcome the problem by having a cue book with plastic pages on stage, which he would turn with his foot during the show.  However, Gillan did not anticipate the \"six buckets\" of dry ice that engulfed the stage, making it impossible for the singer to see the lyric sheets.  \"Ian wasn't very sure-footed either,\" Iommi writes in his memoir.  \"He once fell over my pedal board.  He was waving at the people, stepped back and, bang!, he went arse over head big time.\"  Gillan also told Birch that it was Don Arden's idea to open the show with a crying baby blaring over the speakers and a dwarf made to look exactly like the demonic baby depicted on the Born Again album cover miming to the screaming.  \"We noticed a dwarf walking around the day before the opening show...And we're saying to Don, 'We think this is in the worst possible taste, this dwarf, you know?'  And Don's going, 'Nah, the kids will love it, it'll be great.'\"\nThe tour is most infamous, however, for the gigantic Stonehenge props the band used.  Iommi recalls in his autobiography that it was Butler's idea but the designers took his measurements the wrong way and thought it was meant to be life-size.  Months later, while rehearsing for the tour at the Birmingham NEC, the stage set arrived.  \"We were in shock,\" writes Iommi.  \"This stuff was coming in and in and in.  It had all these huge columns in the back that were as wide as your average bedroom, the columns in front were about 13 feet high, and we had all the monitors and the side fills as well as all this rock.  It was made of fiberglass and wood, and bloody heavy.\" The set would be lampooned in Rob Reiner's 1984 rock music mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, with the band having the opposite problem of having to use miniature Stonehenge stage props.  Butler has said that he told the associate scriptwriter of the film the story of the band's performances with their \"Stonehenge\" stage props. In an interview for the documentary Black Sabbath: 1978\u20131992, Gillan claims Don Arden had the dwarf walk across the top of the Stonehenge props at the start of the show and, as the tape of the screaming baby faded away, fall back \"from about thirty-five feet in the air on this big pile of mattresses.  And then, 'Dong!' The bells start and the monks come out, the whole thing.  Pure Spinal Tap.\"  The band toured Europe first, playing the Reading Festival (a performance that is included on the 2011 deluxe edition of Born Again) and also playing in a bullring in Barcelona in September.  Sabbath performed Gillan's hit with Deep Purple, \"Smoke on the Water\", on the tour, with Iommi explaining in his memoir, \"it seemed like a bum deal for him not to do any of his stuff while he was doing all of ours.  I don't know if we played it properly but the audience loved it.  The critics moaned; it was something out of the bag and they didn't want to know then.\"  In October, the band took the Stonehenge set to America but could only use a portion of it at most gigs because the columns were too high. The set was eventually abandoned.  A music video for \"Zero the Hero\" was also released, featuring performance footage of the band onstage interspersed with scenes involving several grotesque characters performing experiments on a witless young man in a haunted house filled with rats, roosters and a roaming horse."

The band's eighth studio album captures the sound of a European metropolis at night, while sounding unmistakably Kent. Jocke Berg sings about highways and jet planes as well as small-town road crossings and giving someone a ride home on a bicycle. [...] R\u00f6d is certainly no Vapen & ammunition - it will be hard to find more than two working radio singles here - but the sound is world class and the quality shines through in every track.\"Markus Larsson of Aftonbladet wrote: \"The grandiose synth symphonies contain everything from acoustic guitars, techno beats and arena rock drums. Often in one and the same six-minute long song. It might have been unbearable to listen to if Kent didn't constantly anchor the music in fantastic melodies. Those who grow forth and illuminate the darkness in, for example, 'Vals f\u00f6r Satan (din v\u00e4n pessimisten)', 'Sjukhus' and 'Idioter' are among the strongest songs the group have written. R\u00f6d is, above all, proof that the best pop music is always a mixture of anger, resistance and despair.\""

She launched the new webpage Meduza in October 2014. Several former journalists of Lenta.ru joined the new online site.Timchenko told Forbes that the decision to base Meduza in Latvia was made since \"right now, establishing an independent Russian language publishing house in Latvia is possible, while in Russia it is not\". Moreover, Timchenko stated: \"We understood that in Russia, most likely, they would not let us work.\"Russian businessman and former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and telecommunications magnate Boris Zimin had been considered as passive investors, but they parted ways \"for strategic and operational reasons\". Timchenko said Khodorkovsky had wanted 100 percent control of Meduza, which she considered unacceptable. For financial reasons, Timchenko and her partner at Amond & Smith Ltd, Sergey Nazarkin, based Meduza in Latvia.In February 2015, the website also launched an English-language version. In January 2016, Timchenko handed over the role of chief editor to her deputy Ivan Kolpakov.In August 2017, Meduza started a partnership with the American news website BuzzFeed News. The partnership included publishing each other's materials, sharing experiences, and carrying out and publishing joint investigations.On October 20, 2018, at the outlet's annual celebration, Meduza chief editor and co-founder Ivan Kolpakov reportedly groped an employee's wife, saying, \"You're the only one at this party I can harass and get away with it.\" Kolpakov was temporarily suspended until Meduza publicly censured and reinstated him. The incident triggered a social media backlash. On November 9 Kolpakov announced his resignation saying that \"it is the only way to stop the crisis engulfing the website and minimize the damage to its reputation\". He was reinstated as chief editor on March 11, 2019.In 2019, Meduza started the English podcast The Naked Pravda, which highlights how Meduza's top reporting intersects with the wider research and expertise that exists about Russia.In May 2022, Helsingin Sanomat started publishing individual Meduza articles translated in Finnish.In February 2023, Timchenko's iPhone was targeted with Pegasus spyware. The attack occurred a day before a conference of exiled independent Russian media that was held in Berlin and which Timchenko attended; her phone could have been used to eavesdrop on the journalists' conversations during the conference. This attack is the first confirmed instance of Pegasus being used against a Russian journalist. It is unclear which state carried out the attack. Several employees of other independent Russian outlets, Current Time TV and Novaya Gazeta, received notifications from Apple that \"state-sponsored attackers\" may have attacked their phones as well."

Colleagues and friends of Golunov said they believed the charges to be fabricated, motivated by his investigations into corruption. Following a public outcry, Golunov was released, and five police officers were fired and later arrested.On 23 April 2021, the Russian Ministry of Justice designated Meduza as a \"foreign agent\". In response, the European Union rejected the decision, saying this restriction \"goes against Russia's international obligations and human rights commitments\". Russia's actions caused financial difficulties for Meduza, as they stopped many advertisers from Russia, which were the portal's main source of income, from displaying their ads at Meduza's pages. This resulted in an international campaign to collect funds to ensure Meduza's survival through donations and buying subscriptions. Timchenko said the designation made it even harder to obtain sources that are willing to talk to the reporters \u2013 specifically without the protection of anonymity.Meduza published an editorial condemning the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022; due to its coverage of the invasion, the site was blocked on the territory of Russia by Roskomnadzor among other news websites due to the \"systematic dissemination of fakes\". Despite the actions of Roskomnadzor, Meduza managed to maintain most of its Russian readers, but the economic sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine also hit Meduza's finances, as the sanctions made it nearly impossible to send donations from Russia and 30,000 members across the Russian border were suddenly unable to donate to the website. As a result, Meduza launched a campaign seeking donations from new supporters outside of Russia. On March 11, Reporters Without Borders announced a mirror site has been set up. Russian journalist Ilya Krasilshchik, the former publisher of Meduza, was charged under the \"fake news\" law for denouncing the war in Ukraine.On 26 January 2023, the Russian prosecutor-general\u2019s office designated Meduza as an \"undesirable organization\" in Russia. In March 2023, Timchenko said that while \"Russian propaganda has enormous financial sources\" and the government can spend billions to spread disinformation, Meduza has a \"little crowdfunding campaign by people of good will around the world, and some support from international organizations\"."

It was borne by one of the disciples of Christ, best known for his skepticism about Christ's resurrection (John 20, John 20:24\u201329). The th- spelling in English results from the initial letter of the name in the Greek New Testament being a theta. The English pronunciation as t rather than a dental fricative is the result of French influence from an early date. In Britain, the surname is widely distributed throughout the country, but especially common in Cornwall and Wales. Thomas is the ninth most common surname in the United Kingdom. It is found as a personal name among Christians in India, and in the United States; it is also used as a family name among the Saint Thomas Christian families from Kerala, South India.In the 1990 United States Census, Thomas was the twelfth most common surname, accounting for 0.3% of the population.In France, Thomas (pronounced [t\u0254m\u0251]) is the third most widespread surname after Martin and Bernard, with over 100,000 people with this name."

Moreover, it wanted to spread some notions about Legislation, History, technical discoveries and Geography. Furthermore, it disseminated a certain utopian socialism influenced by Saint-Simon. Another theme was Literature and this magazine is one of the few samples from the liberal Catalan Romanticism. \u201cEl Propagador de la libertad\u201d defended the social function of literature and it fight against Classicism like a movement that had been overcome. It spread the works of Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo and Heine.\nThe collaborators of the magazine were A. Fontcuberta, Pere Mata, F. Alt\u00e9s i Gurena, A. Ribot, Gener i Solanes, Antoni Gironella, J. Eydoux and J. Strozzi. This staff changed as a consequence of the revolutionary successes from 1836 because a lot of the writers were arrested and exiled. As a result, A. Fontcuberta, who used the pseudonym of Josep Andreu Covert-Spring started directing the magazine. Some of the collaborators changed too and in this period we can find Pau Piferrer, Manuel Mil\u00e0 i Fontanals and Joaquim M. Bover.The objective of spreading the new ideas among the farmers was not achieved due to the high intellectual level of the magazine, which was a barrier for this social group. At the end, \u201cEl Propagador de la libertad\u201d was one of the most important literary, cultural and scientific magazines of its period due to its connections with the progressive current of thought."

The album returned to the inclusion of vocal interludes between songs as last heard on their album So Tough and a more angular, electronic sound, particularly on tracks such as \"Action\", \"Shower Scene\" and \"New Thing\". \"Language Lab\" and \"Summerisle\" recall the ambient style of Sound of Water, while \"Stop and Think It Over\" would not have been out of place on Good Humor or its predecessor, Tiger Bay.\nThe vocal interludes were supplied by Michael Jayston's narration as featured in the film released to accompany the album, also called Finisterre. The film was directed by Paul Kelly and Kieran Evans and was born out of visuals used to accompany certain tracks from the album shown during their live shows. The film debuted at a sold-out show in October 2002 at the Royal Festival Hall on London's Southbank, and was re-released to select screens in 2005. It is currently available on DVD. The album sleeve features a photograph of the East London tower block Ronan Point shortly after it collapsed in 1968 with the loss of four lives.\nNitsuh Abebe of Pitchfork Media scored the album 7.6 out of ten and wrote that \"[t]he big comeback on Finisterre's part is that they're tugging those strings again, confidently\", citing \"B92\" as a highlight. However, Abebe criticised \"Action\" and \"New Thing\" as \"just begging for the bigger kick drums that would turn them into flat-out stompers.\""

It reached number one in the UK Albums Chart with first week sales of 237,865, and is the 32nd fastest selling album ever in the UK. The album entered the US charts at number 12, with 65,000 copies sold in the first week, the highest any Oasis album had reached there since 1997's Be Here Now, although its chart stay was brief. Don't Believe the Truth went triple platinum in the UK in the first week of 2006 (900,000+ sales), and in the US has sold more than 200,000 copies.As with the previous album, Don't Believe The Truth had significant writing contributions from members other than chief songwriter Noel Gallagher, and the album is the first where all duties were divided between the band members. On some of the tracks regular bass player Andy Bell handled guitar, while Gem Archer and Noel Gallagher contributed bass to other songs. Don't Believe the Truth is the first Oasis record to feature the drumming of Zak Starkey, an auxiliary member of Oasis, who performed and toured with them following the departure of longtime drummer Alan White, and appeared on the DVD praising all members' contributions. The album received positive reviews from critics, and many cited it as Oasis' best album in a decade.\nLiam Gallagher also had a larger impact on the album through his developing songwriting. Noel has said that the album is his favourite of Oasis' last four, because all members contributed to it. This, he claims, has given it a different feel from a typically Noel-written Oasis album.\nThe band embarked on a massive worldwide tour that started off at the London Astoria for their Don't Believe the Truth Tour, visiting 26 countries and playing to 3.2 million people at a total of 113 concerts. This resulted in the making of Lord Don't Slow Me Down, a film later released on DVD. To date, the album has sold seven million copies worldwide."

        "content": "The recording process for Don't Believe the Truth was prolonged. The album was originally supposed to be released around summer/autumn 2004, with an initial three to four-week session produced by Death in Vegas. The recording finally began after Alan White's departure in January 2004 at Sawmills Studios in Cornwall, though the group were not satisfied with the results, as Noel Gallagher said: \"Unfortunately, after the recording process we decided we didn't like anything we had played/recorded during those three weeks, and because of commitments with Death in Vegas, Richard Fearless and Tim Holmes couldn't find any more time to give to the project.\"Noel has commented since on numerous occasions that there was no problem with the work done by Death in Vegas, but he felt the songs they were working on were simply not good enough to form a record, and felt a break was needed in which new material would have to be written. In Noel's words: \"We were trying to polish a turd\". Around ten songs were worked on with Death in Vegas of which, according to Noel, six were \"not even good enough to make the b-sides\". Four of the tracks which eventually appeared on the album were worked on with Death in Vegas, those songs being: \"Turn Up the Sun\", \"Mucky Fingers\", \"A Bell Will Ring\" and \"The Meaning of Soul\", although all of these had extra work done to them or were re-recorded before being released.After a short break in which many new songs, including \"Let There Be Love,\" \"Lyla\" and \"Part of The Queue\" were written, the band reconvened at their Wheeler End Studios with Noel as producer. The band were joined on these sessions by The Who's drummer Zak Starkey. In June 2004, Oasis debuted two new songs from these sessions, the Liam-written \"The Meaning of Soul\" and the Gem-written \"A Bell Will Ring\" at two live shows in Poole and at the Glastonbury Festival."

        "content": "The decision to have the lead-off single, \"Lyla\", on the album was a controversial one, prompted by the label's feeling that there wasn't a suitable lead single among the tracks originally presented. As a result, the decision was taken to record \"Lyla\", a song which Noel had written and demoed a year previously, but which wasn't recorded by the band during the previous recording sessions. It was decided that Dave Sardy would remix Noel's original demo with Liam recording a set of lead vocals and Zak adding a fresh drum track. \"Lyla\" reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and number nineteen on the US Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. After having initial reservations about the choice of the first single being taken out of the hands of the band, Noel, who initially wanted \"Mucky Fingers\" to be the first single, has now reluctantly conceded that the song has indeed \"done the business\".In April 2005, four tracks from a promo disc leaked: \"The Meaning of Soul\", \"Mucky Fingers\", \"Keep the Dream Alive\", and \"Let There Be Love\". The full album found its way onto the Internet on 3 May 2005 instead of 30 May, when Apple Inc. accidentally put the album up early for sale on their iTunes Music Store service in Germany. While there was no official comment by Apple or by Oasis management, it was speculated that Apple simply got the dates confused."

The hymn first appeared in print in a 1626 collection of Dutch folk and patriotic songs, Neder-landtsche Gedenck-Clanck by Adriaen Valerius.\nIn anglophone hymnology, the tune is known as \"Kremser\", from Eduard Kremser's 1877 score arrangement and lyric translation of Wilt Heden Nu Treden into Latin and German. The modern English text was written by Theodore Baker in 1894.\nAccording to the Hymn Society in the United States and Canada, \"We Gather Together's\" first appearance in an American hymnal was in 1903. It had retained popularity among the Dutch, and when the Dutch Reformed Church in North America decided in 1937 to abandon the policy that they had brought with them to the New World in the 17th century of singing only psalms and add hymns to the church service,  \"We Gather Together\" was chosen as the first hymn in the first hymnal.A different translation under the first line We Praise Thee, O God, Our Redeemer, Creator was translated by J.B.C. Cory (1882-1963).The hymn steadily gained popularity, especially in services of Thanksgiving on such occasions as town and college centennial celebrations.   According to Carl Daw, executive director of the Hymn Society, the \"big break\" came in 1935 when it was included in the national hymnal of the Methodist-Episcopal Church.According to Michael Hawn, professor of sacred music at Southern Methodist University's Perkins School of Theology, \"by World War I, we started to see ourselves in this hymn,\" and the popularity increased during World War II, when \"the wicked oppressing\" were understood to include Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.This hymn is often sung at American churches the Sunday before Thanksgiving.\nThis hymn was sung at the Opening of the Funeral Mass for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The West Wing episode \"Shibboleth\" (season 2, episode 8 \"Shibboleth\") alluded to the hymn, and it was played in the episode's final scene (performed by the Cedarmont Kids.)The hymn is also usually sung by the Quartermaine family on the American soap opera General Hospital's annual Thanksgiving episode."

Otherwise this is just frothy fun, which is fine\u2014but only fine.\" Alex Lai of Contactmusic.com stated that \"A return to the popularity that greeted their initial breakthrough isn't likely, but there's more than enough here to repair their reputation and ensure they shouldn't be seen as a flash-in-the-pan act.\"Stephen Dalton of Uncut wrote, \"With echoes of prime-time Chic, Prince and Madonna, the intent is admirable even if too many of the songs feel flimsy and pedestrian\", but described the songs \"Communication\" and \"Failure\" as \"unabashedly gorgeous blasts of sugardipped synth-funk hedonism.\" Despite stating that the album \"actually isn't all that bad, and certainly marks an improvement on its disastrous predecessor, Songs from Nowheresville\", the Shields Gazette commented that \"there's here nothing which leaves any lasting impression.\" Dorian Lynskey of Q magazine noted that Super Critical \"sounds less petulant but no more likely to return [the duo] to the Top 10\", adding that it \"would be a solid album for someone like Annie, For The Ting Tings, though, it suggests there's no way back from Nowheresville.\" The Observer's Killian Fox opined that the duo \"can still write a catchy tune [...] but these songs are all surface, with only the odd hook to snag us.\" Guy Oddy of The Arts Desk panned the album, dubbing it a \"disappointment\" and expressing that \"it's not wholly clear whether the Ting Tings have become cultural commentators, like Negativland without samplers, and Super Critical is a prank about the vacuousness of so much chart pop, or whether they've committed commercial suicide.\""

Bassists Donald \"Duck\" Dunn from Booker T. & the MG's and Nathan East (later of the smooth jazz quartet Fourplay) also played on the sessions.\nIn his autobiography, Clapton remembers the 1984 session pleasantly: \"The whole thing is going so great, I hope it never stops.\" However, his troubled marriage with Pattie Boyd became the subject matter for most of his original material: \"She's Waiting\", \"Same Old Blues\" and \"Just Like a Prisoner\" all contain extended guitar solos from Clapton. It was during this period that Boyd left him and \"it was eventually decided that we should have a trial separation\". Clapton assuaged his pain by writing the song \"Behind the Sun\", featuring only his guitar and vocals along with Phil Collins' synthesizer, as the final song on the album.\nThis was Clapton's first collaboration with songwriter Jerry Lynn Williams. Warner Brothers looked critically at this follow-up to the Money and Cigarettes album, Clapton's first for the label, which did not sell well. The Collins-produced Behind the Sun first submitted in the fall of 1984 was rejected by the label, insisting that he record several new songs written by Williams, backed by Los Angeles session players. The label put the project under the auspices of veteran company producers Lenny Waronker and Ted Templeman. Warner Brothers then emphasised the new tracks, releasing two of them, \"Forever Man\" (which reached the Top 40) and \"See What Love Can Do,\" as singles. Clapton agreed to their terms, but asked them to provide some \"hits\" and record the songs with their own producer and musicians: \"They sent me three songs by a Texas songwriter \u2013 \"Forever Man\", \"Something's Happening\" and \"See What Love Can Do\" \u2013 and they were good.\" The sessions featured Toto guitarist Steve Lukather and  then-drummer Jeff Porcaro, as well as Clapton's long-time collaborators, drummer Jamie Oldaker, bassist Nathan East and keyboardist Greg Phillinganes."

Robert Christgau in his Village Voice Consumer Guide described the album as \"[s]ad [a]nd also bad\" because Clapton was simply following commercial market fashion.In a retrospective summary for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann feels that the album is \"somewhat schizophrenic\" due to the tinkering of the record label, who were concerned that the original version of the album contained no hits and was too downbeat, so brought in new writers and producers. Ruhlman concludes that despite some effective guitar work the album is competent rather than exciting, and is not among Clapton's best.Cash Box said that the second single \"See What Love Can Do\" \"plays off a reggae/gospel theme and provides an excellent showcase for some tasteful guitar playing.\"Cash Box also praised its \"tight background vocals and rhythm section.\"Billboard said of that song that it has \"moody groundwells of texture in a many-layered rock ballad.\""

However, due to the huge success of the single \"Les Mots\", recorded as duet with Seal, the new single was not released until April 2002. The promotional CD single was sent to radio stations on 4 March 2002, then the promotional vinyl on 28 March 2002. There were three versions of the CD single : one is supple, the second is thick, the third is a picture disc.Several remixes were produced on the three media (CD single, CD maxi, 12\" maxi): 'elegie's club remix ', by Blue Planet Corporation, 'such a beautiful day's remix' and 'beauty and bed remix', by StarCity, 'what a souci's remix', by Tom Novy. Another remix was only available on the German Promotional CD single, 'elegie's remix club radio edit', also by Blue Planet Corporation. In 2004, a new remix was made by Devis Head, engineered by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Devoise at Studio Guillaume Tell, in Paris. Two other maxi CDs were released in Germany and Canada, with the same track listings as the French one, but with a crystal case. The promotional CD contains two white feathers : one on the cover (at the end of the word \"journ\u00e9e\"), the other inside. The photography was directed by Ellen von Unwerth, and the cover design was made by Henry Neu.\nAs for her other singles, Myl\u00e8ne Farmer wrote the lyrics and Laurent Boutonnat composed the music. About the lyrics, Farmer, interviewed by TF1, confessed to have changed the words of the chorus afterthought. Initially, \"C'est une belle journ\u00e9e, je vais me tuer\", which could be taken as an incitement to suicide by vulnerable people, was replaced in the end with \"C'est une belle journ\u00e9e, je vais me coucher\".Jean-Claude D\u00e9qu\u00e9ant, who composed \"Libertine\" for Farmer in 1986, said he had \"great admiration\" for \"C'est une belle journ\u00e9e\"."

        "content": "In this song, Farmer talks about \"her irresistible need to see the bad side of things, contrary to most people\". This song is very similar in its structure to \"Je t'aime m\u00e9lancolie\" : indeed, the two songs have heavy dance sounds and deal with the same gloomy themes. Concerning the lyrics, death and religious references are present, including the angels in the refrain.Expert of French charts \u00c9lia Habib considered that \"C'est une belle journ\u00e9e\" \"has an intro worthy of a 1980s opus of Pet Shop Boys\" and said it \"is a song with a tempo surprisingly cheerful\"; however, he maintained: \"Under this cover unusual are concealed again recurring themes of the Farmer anthology: death, nostalgia, vision of a world torn between good and evil, brevity of life\". To author Erwan Chuberre, \"C'est une belle journ\u00e9e\" is \"a catchy and joyful song at the first hearing but that turns out to be, finally, rather dark\", and has \"a lot of irony and humor\". According to French magazine Instant-Mag, \"we find [in this song] all Farmer and Boutonnat's art of the beautiful time, namely involve very delicately melancholy lyrics and skipping music, or even a bit commercial\". \"Apology of suicide, sleep, pessimism, departure\", the song is \"a call to sacrifice, to let go, to flee to a world of spiritual and physical peace\". \"Behind the joyful and optimistic notes of the song, we can perceive stenchs much less happy and much more ambiguous. Farmer is in a pessimistic perspective, referring to the death behind the apparent sleep, the emptiness instead of the full, the completion instead of the beginning, and the flight as a reunion.\" There is also a parallel with Le Dormeur du val, written by French poet Arthur Rimbaud.About the lyrics, Farmer said: \"It would be indecent to directly address the topic of suicide. Too easy. Because I am protected by my family circle, by this success that gives me some strength. Those who listen to me do not always have them, that security.\" However, as noted by psychologist Hugues Royer, suicide evoked in the lyrics is intended to relieve a too heavy sadness, but to avoid, paradoxically, the horizon of a possible happiness."

There are also rumors about the fact that the video would be produced from the singer's drawings \u2013 and that was right -, as it had done for the CD maxi and vinyl's covers for \"Dessine-moi un mouton\".Finally, for the first time in the star's career, the video, directed by Beno\u00eet Di Sabatino, was produced as a cartoon film. Shot in Paris, it cost about 120,000 euros. As always, it was a Requiem Publishing and Stuffed Monkey production, and the screenplay was written by Farmer. The music video was announced in the media.In addition to Farmer, the video features a young girl, Lisa, who has already appeared on the cover of the second Marc Levy novel, O\u00f9 es-tu ?, a sheep already seen on \"Dessine-moi un mouton\"'s cover, a spider (initially created for the program of the 1996 concert tour) and a rat, in a childish style. There are several references to Le Petit Prince, a 1943 Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry novella.\nAt the beginning of the video, we see a bare tree and maple leaves flying. A slender young woman (Farmer) begins the day doing some stretches on her bed with the sheep bouncing on her stomach. Inadvertently, she kicks her sheep and looks for it around her as a rat in a toy car drives by. Then while she is bathing, a spider appears in a thought bubble. The sheep eats a bar of soap, hiccups, finds itself in a bubble and falls in the bathtub. Then, at noon, Farmer encloses the sheep in her refrigerator. She sits on it and swings her legs to the rhythm of the clock's hands which go round very quickly. Farmer then juggles with her frozen sheep. In the afternoon, she goes and sits on her bed, plays with a spider and seems to be very sad. Suddenly, a young child appears at the door, hung by her feet. She plays with a ball and flies to the tree. Farmer looks at her for a while, and eventually follows her. There the child dances and plays leapfrog with the sheep. The child, the sheep, the rat in its car, maple leaves, and some words fly by in a whirlwind. At the end of the day, Farmer lies down with the sheep and the video ends with a mention \"To be continued\".According to some analyses, the video emphasizes melancholy and nostalgia. In this context, the dead tree could illustrate the faded beauty of the world, the spider would be the personification of the singer's black thoughts, while the sheep would represent Farmer's lost dreams and deepest disillusionment. The clock's hands going round quickly are likely to illustrate the time gap between physical and mental time. As for the little girl, she would represent Farmer when she was younger and carefree. The fact that the child was hung by the feet at a certain time might refer to \u0152dipus, but also to Farmer's song \"Jardin de Vienne\" in which a child finds freedom by hanging. However, the final words of the video leave a glimmer of hope."

For the first and only time, she appeared in the trailer, announcing her own performance in the broadcast (the fact that the singer sang that day for a humanitarian cause may have been a factor). At the end of the song, feathers were released on the set. As noted by Instant-Mag, these performances were conducted with a great deal of relaxation. The choreography, \"fluid, joyful\" and carried out with two female dancers, \"was much less ceremonial than that of \"L'\u00c2me-stram-gram\"\", and Farmer was smiling more than usual. At each performance, she wore a hat on her head.The song was performed during the 2006 tour. When the song started, the letters CUBJ (the acronym of \"C'est une belle journ\u00e9e\"), then drawings from the music video, appeared on giant screens in the back of the stage.

        "content": "Zohar and Daffi are two soldiers trying to serve out their mandatory service with the IDF. On their way back to base after the weekend Daffi bumps into a new girl Tehila and, believing that she is her replacement, takes her under her wing. Daffi and Zohar work menial jobs with Daffi being forced to shred paper. After Daffi trains the new girl she goes to her supervisor Rama and explains that after writing letters to everyone she could trying to get a new position in Tel Aviv they have finally sent a replacement. However Tehila is not a replacement at all but has snuck onto the base to see a boy she slept with and fell in love with. After he rejects her she slits her belly and crawls into bed where she is discovered by the other girls in the morning. Daffi is crushed by her death realizing that she will not be replaced after all. However, when she complains to personnel the officer in charge tells her she herself got transferred by applying to be an officer. Daffi then gets a recommendation from Rama and a boy Zohar has a crush on and is transferred away. She and Zohar part on bad terms.\nLeft alone, Zohar is teased by the other girls for being a virgin. Irena, one of her co-workers, advises her to sleep with a boy as soon as possible. Zohar takes this advice to heart and flirts with a visiting soldier she meets while guarding the arms, setting up a date with him for the following night. Returning to her dorm room, she climbs into her bunk bed and it breaks. After she refuses to sleep in the only spare bed, where Tehila was found dead, Irena lets her sleep in her bed and sleeps in Tehila's old bed, where she hallucinates in the middle of the night that Tehila is there with her.\nThe following day Irena behaves bizarrely and the girls begin to believe that there is something wrong with her. Zohar offers to take her to the infirmary but instead prepares for her date with the visiting soldier. However Irena insists on coming on the date and behaves strangely the entire time. When Zohar and her date finally manage to be alone, he aggressively strips off her clothes and when she asks him to be gentle, he tells her she should have gone with a non-combatant. She asks him to stop; he ignores her but is stopped by Irena who pulls his rifle on him and humiliates him before finally letting him go. Once Irena and Zohar return to the office, Rama chastises them for not going to the infirmary. When Zohar explains that she was almost raped and that Irena saved her, Irena claims to have no idea what she's talking about, and Zohar realizes that Tehila's ghost must have left her. Unimpressed, Rama makes Zohar stay in the office all night cleaning. When she returns in the morning she is impressed that the office is spotless but soon finds that Zohar has shredded every record in the department and stuffed them in Rama's office.\nAs a result of destroying all the records, Zohar is sent to military prison, and Rama is discharged despite wanting to stay in the army and become a career officer. Meanwhile, Daffi finally graduates from officer training and instead of being placed in Tel-Aviv, receives Rama's old position. Despite trying to make the best of the situation Daffi finds that Zohar is insubordinate and rude. After she tries to punish Zohar, Zohar photocopies the old letters that Daffi wrote to try to get off base and posts them all around the base. Daffi in turn tries to delete all the computer game records that she and Zohar used to play together. The two get in a violent fight with staple guns and Daffi wins. However, instead of the games, Daffi accidentally deletes all the recently digitized staff records.\nThe two are arrested and when Daffi tries to admit her mistake, Zohar takes the blame for it. She is sentenced to more time in military prison while Daffi is demoted to a cushy office job in Tel Aviv. After she gets out of prison Zohar gives up on Minesweeper and becomes addicted to Freecell. She is transferred to the infirmary where she has sex with the soldier responsible for digitizing the military records, who suffered a nervous breakdown after she deleted them. Her service finally comes to an end, as E-mail replaces paper mail. She leaves the army base, helping Daffi draft another plea."
