With the publication of the second edition, a rumor circulated that the dictionary contained a fictitious entry in the letter 'e'. New Yorker contributing editor Henry Alford combed the section, and discussed several unusual entries he found with a group of American lexicographers.

Of the word, she said \"its inherent fakeitude is fairly obvious.\" The fake entry apparently ensnared dictionary.com, which included an entry for it (that has since been removed) which it attributed to Webster's New Millennium Dictionary, both of which are owned by the private company Lexico.  Possibly due to its licensing of Oxford dictionaries, Google Dictionary included the word, listing three meanings and giving usage examples."

It was subtitled The London Charivari in homage to Charles Philipon's French satirical humour magazine Le Charivari. Reflecting their satiric and humorous intent, the two editors took for their name and masthead the anarchic glove puppet, Mr. Punch, of Punch and Judy; the name also referred to a joke made early on about one of the magazine's first editors, Lemon, that \"punch is nothing without lemon\". Mayhew ceased to be joint editor in 1842 and became \"suggestor in chief\" until he severed his connection in 1845. The magazine initially struggled for readers, except for an 1842 \"Almanack\" issue which shocked its creators by selling 90,000 copies.  In December 1842 due to financial difficulties, the magazine was sold to Bradbury and Evans, both printers and publishers. Bradbury and Evans capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies and also were the publishers for Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray."

Punch humorously appropriated the term to refer to its political cartoons, and the popularity of the Punch cartoons led to the term's widespread use."

This group became known as \"The Punch Brotherhood\", which also included Charles Dickens, who joined Bradbury and Evans after leaving Chapman and Hall in 1843. Punch'''s authors and artists also contributed to another Bradbury and Evans literary magazine called Once A Week (est. 1859), created in response to Dickens' departure from Household Words.

        "title": "Punch (magazine)_Gaining a market and relations with other papers",
        "content": "After months of financial difficulty and lack of market success, Punch became a staple for British drawing rooms because of its sophisticated humour and absence of offensive material, especially when viewed against the satirical press of the time. The Times and the Sunday paper News of the World used small pieces from Punch as column fillers, giving the magazine free publicity and indirectly granting a degree of respectability, a privilege not enjoyed by any other comic publication. Punch shared a friendly relationship with not only The Times, but  also journals aimed at intellectual audiences such as the Westminster Review, which published a 53-page illustrated article on Punch's first two volumes. Historian Richard Altick writes that \"To judge from the number of references to it in the private letters and memoirs of the 1840s...Punch had become a household word within a year or two of its founding, beginning in the middle class and soon reaching the pinnacle of society, royalty itself\". Increasing in readership and popularity throughout the remainder of the 1840s and '50s, Punch was the success story of a threepenny weekly paper that had become one of the most talked-about and enjoyed periodicals. Punch enjoyed an audience including Elizabeth Barrett, Robert Browning, Thomas Carlyle, Edward FitzGerald, Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Emily Dickinson, Herman Melville, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and James Russell Lowell. Punch gave several phrases to the English language, including The Crystal Palace, and the \"Curate's egg\" (first seen in an 1895 cartoon by George du Maurier). Several British humour classics were first serialised in Punch, such as the Diary of a Nobody and 1066 and All That. Towards the end of the 19th century, the artistic roster included Harry Furniss, Linley Sambourne, Francis Carruthers Gould, and Phil May. Among the outstanding cartoonists of the following century were Bernard Partridge, H. M. Bateman, Bernard Hollowood (who also edited the magazine from 1957 to 1968), Kenneth Mahood, and Norman Thelwell. Circulation broke the 100,000 mark around 1910, and peaked in 1947\u20131948 at 175,000 to 184,000.  Sales declined steadily thereafter; ultimately, the magazine was forced to close in 2002 after 161 years of publication.Punch was widely emulated worldwide and was popular throughout the British Empire. The experience of Britons in British colonies, especially in India, influenced Punch and its iconography. Tenniel's Punch cartoons of the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny led to a surge in the magazine's popularity. India was frequently caricatured in Punch and was an important source of knowledge on the subcontinent for British readers. Later years Punch material was collected in book formats from the late 19th century, which included Pick of the Punch annuals with cartoons and text features, Punch and the War (a 1941 collection of WWII-related cartoons), and A Big Bowl of Punch \u2013 which was republished a number of times. Many Punch cartoonists of the late 20th century published collections of their own, partly based on Punch contributions. In early 1996, businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed bought the rights to the name, and Punch was relaunched later that year.Whack! Whack! Whack! Reborn Punch Pounded Warren Hodge, The New York Times,  18 September 1996. Retrieved 16 March 2013. The new version of the magazine was intended to be a spoiler aimed at Private Eye, which had published many items critical of Fayed. Punch never became profitable in its new incarnation, and at the end of May 2002, it was announced as once more ceasing publication. Press reports quoted a loss of \u00a316 million over the six years of publication, with only 6,000 subscribers at the end. Whereas the earlier version of Punch prominently featured the clownish character Punchinello (Punch of Punch and Judy) performing antics on front covers, the resurrected Punch did not use the character, but featured on its weekly covers a photograph of a boxing glove, thus informing its readers that the new magazine intended its name to mean \"punch\" in the sense of a boxing blow."

Although  is traditionally a form of fantasy literature, its popularity has caused it to be adapted for such diverse art forms as Chinese opera, , films, television series, and video games. It forms part of popular culture in many Chinese-speaking communities around the world. The word \"\" is a compound composed of the elements  (, literally \"martial\", \"military\", or \"armed\") and  (, literally \"chivalrous\", \"vigilante\" or \"hero\"). A martial artist who follows the code of  is often referred to as a  (, literally \"follower of \") or  (, literally \"wandering \"). In some translations, the martial artist is referred to as a \"swordsman\" or \"swordswoman\" even though they may not necessarily wield a sword. The heroes in wuxia fiction typically do not serve a lord, wield military power, or belong to the aristocratic class. They often originate from the lower social classes of ancient Chinese society. A code of chivalry usually requires wuxia heroes to right and redress wrongs, fight for righteousness, remove oppressors, and bring retribution for past misdeeds. Chinese  traditions can be compared to martial codes from other cultures, such as the Japanese samurai ."

        "title": "Wuxia_Earlier precedents",
        "content": "Even though the term \"wuxia\" as the name of a genre is a recent coinage, stories about xia date back more than 2,000 years. Wuxia stories have their roots in some early youxia tales from 300\u2013200 BCE. The Legalist philosopher Han Fei spoke disparagingly of youxias in his book Han Feizi in the chapter On Five 'Maggot' Classes about five social classes in the Spring and Autumn period. Some well-known stories include Zhuan Zhu's assassination of King Liao of Wu, and most notably, Jing Ke's attempt on the life of the King of Qin (who later became Qin Shi Huang). In Volume 86 of the Records of the Grand Historian (Shi Ji), Sima Qian mentioned five notable assassins \u2013 Cao Mo, Zhuan Zhu, Yu Rang, Nie Zheng and Jing Ke \u2013 in the Warring States period who undertook tasks of conducting political assassinations of aristocrats and nobles. These assassins were known as cike (\u523a\u5ba2; literally \"stabbing guests\"). They usually rendered their loyalties and services to feudal lords and nobles in return for rewards such as riches and women. In Volume 124 of the Shi Ji, Sima Qian detailed several embryonic features of xia culture from his period. These popular phenomena were also documented in other historical records such as the Book of Han and the Book of the Later Han. Xiake stories made a turning point in the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907 CE) and returned in the form of chuanqi (\u50b3\u5947; literally \"legendary tales\"). Stories from that era, such as Nie Yinniang (\u8076\u96b1\u5a18), The Kunlun Slave, Thirteenth Madame Jing (\u834a\u5341\u4e09\u5a18), Red String (\u7d05\u7dda) and The Bearded Warrior (\u866c\u9aef\u5ba2), served as prototypes for modern wuxia stories. They featured fantasies and isolated protagonists \u2013 usually loners \u2013 who performed daring heroic deeds. During the Song dynasty (960\u20131279 CE), similar stories circulated in the huaben, short works that were once thought to have served as prompt-books for shuochang (traditional Chinese storytelling). The genre of the martial or military romance also developed during the Tang dynasty. In the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 CE), Luo Guanzhong and Shi Nai'an wrote Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin respectively, which are among the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. The former is a romanticised historical retelling of the events in the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period, while the latter criticises the deplorable socio-economic status of the late Northern Song dynasty. Water Margin is often seen as the first full-length wuxia novel: the portrayal of the 108 heroes, and their code of honour and willingness to become outlaws rather than serve a corrupt government, played an influential role in the development of jianghu culture in later centuries. Romance of the Three Kingdoms is also seen as a possible early antecedent and contains classic close-combat descriptions that were later emulated by wuxia writers in their works In the Qing dynasty (1644-1911 CE), further developments were the gong'an (\u516c\u6848; literally \"public case\") and related detective novels, where xia and other heroes, in collaboration with a judge or magistrate, solved crimes and battled injustice. The Justice Bao stories from Sanxia Wuyi (\u4e09\u4fe0\u4e94\u7fa9; later extended and renamed to Qixia Wuyi) and Xiaowuyi (\u5c0f\u4e94\u7fa9), incorporated much of social justice themes of later wuxia stories. Xiayi stories of chivalrous romance, which frequently featured female heroes and supernatural fighting abilities, also surfaced during the Qing dynasty. Novels such as Shi Gong'an Qiwen (\u65bd\u516c\u6848\u5947\u805e) and Ern\u00fc Yingxiong Zhuan (\u5152\u5973\u82f1\u96c4\u50b3) have been cited as the clearest nascent wuxia novels. The term \"wuxia\" as a genre label itself first appeared at the end of the Qing dynasty, a calque of the Japanese \"buky\u014d\", a genre of oft-militaristic and bushido-influenced adventure fiction. The term was brought to China by writers and students who hoped that China would modernise its military and place emphasis on martial virtues, and it quickly became entrenched as the term used to refer to xiayi and other predecessors of wuxia proper. In Japan, however, the term \"buky\u014d\" faded into obscurity. Many wuxia works produced during the Ming and Qing dynasties were lost due to the governments' crackdown on and banning of such works. Wuxia works were deemed responsible for brewing anti-government sentiments, which led to rebellions in those eras. The departure from mainstream literature also meant that patronage of this genre was limited to the masses and not to the literati, which led to the stifling of the development of the wuxia genre. Nonetheless, the wuxia genre remained enormously popular with the common people."

        "content": "The modern wuxia genre rose to prominence in the early 20th century after the May Fourth Movement of 1919. A new literature evolved, calling for a break with Confucian values, and the xia emerged as a symbol of personal freedom, defiance to Confucian tradition, and rejection of the Chinese family system. Xiang Kairan (pen name Pingjiang Buxiaosheng) became the first notable wuxia writer, with his debut novel being The Peculiar Knights-Errant of the Jianghu (\u6c5f\u6e56\u5947\u4fe0\u50b3). It was serialised from 1921\u201328 and was adapted into the first wuxia film, The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple (1928). Zhao Huanting (\u8d99\u7165\u4ead), who wrote Chronicles of the Loyal Knights-Errant (\u5947\u4fe0\u7cbe\u5fe0\u50b3, serialised 1923\u201327), was another well-known wuxia writer based in Shanghai. Starting from the 1930s, wuxia works proliferated and its centre shifted to Beijing and Tianjin in northern China. The most prolific writers there were collectively referred to as the Five Great Masters of the Northern School (\u5317\u6d3e\u4e94\u5927\u5bb6): Huanzhulouzhu, who wrote The Swordspeople from Shu Mountains (\u8700\u5c71\u528d\u4fe0\u50b3); Gong Baiyu (\u5bae\u767d\u7fbd), who wrote Twelve Coin Darts (\u5341\u4e8c\u91d1\u9322\u93e2); Wang Dulu, who wrote The Crane-Iron Pentalogy (\u9e64\u9244\u4e94\u90e8\u4f5c); Zheng Zhengyin (\u90d1\u8a3c\u56e0), who wrote The King of Eagle Claws (\u9e70\u722a\u738b); Zhu Zhenmu (\u6731\u8c9e\u6728), who wrote The Seven 'Kill' Stele (\u4e03\u6bba\u7891). Wuxia fiction was banned at various times during the Republican era and these restrictions stifled the growth of the genre. In spite of this, wuxia writing prevailed in other Chinese-speaking regions, such as Taiwan and Hong Kong. Between the 1960s and 1980s, the genre entered a golden age.  Writers such as Liang Yusheng and Louis Cha (Jin Yong) spearheaded the founding of a \"new school\" of the wuxia genre that differed largely from its predecessors. They wrote serials for newspapers and magazines. They also incorporated several fictional themes such as mystery and romance from other cultures. In Taiwan, Wolong Sheng, Sima Ling, Zhuge Qingyun (\u8af8\u845b\u9752\u96f2), Shiao Yi (\u8427\u9038) and Gu Long became the region's best known wuxia writers. After them, writers such as Woon Swee Oan and Huang Yi rose to prominence in a later period. Chen Yu-hui is a contemporary female wuxia novelist who made her debut with the novel The Tian-Guan Duo Heroes (\u5929\u89c0\u96d9\u4fe0). There have also been works created after the 1980s which attempt to create a post-wuxia genre. Yu Hua, one of the more notable writers from this period, published a counter-genre short story titled Blood and Plum Blossoms, in which the protagonist goes on a quest to avenge his murdered father."

        "content": "Modern wuxia stories are largely set in ancient or pre-modern China. The historical setting can range from being quite specific and important to the story, to being vaguely-defined, anachronistic, or mainly for use as a backdrop. Elements of fantasy, such as the use of magic powers and appearance of supernatural beings, are common in some wuxia stories but are not a prerequisite of the wuxia genre. However, the martial arts element is a definite part of a wuxia tale, as the characters must know some form of martial arts. Themes of romance are also strongly featured in some wuxia tales. A typical wuxia story features a young male protagonist who experiences a tragedy \u2013 such as the loss of his loved ones \u2013 and goes on to undertake several trials and tribulations to learn several forms of martial arts from various fighters. At the end of the story, he emerges as a powerful fighter whom few can equal. He uses his abilities to follow the code of xia and mends the ills of the jianghu. For instance, the opening chapters of some of Jin Yong's works follow a certain pattern: a tragic event occurs, usually one that costs the lives of the newly introduced characters, and then it sets events into motion that will culminate in the primary action of the story. Other stories use different structures. For instance, the protagonist is denied admission into a martial arts sect. He experiences hardships and trains secretly and waits until there is an opportunity for him to show off his skills and surprise those who initially looked down on him. Some stories feature a mature hero with powerful martial arts abilities confronting an equally powerful antagonist as his nemesis. The plot will gradually meander to a final dramatic showdown between the protagonist and his nemesis. These types of stories were prevalent during the era of anti-Qing revolutionaries. Certain stories have unique plots, such as those by Gu Long and Huang Yi. Gu Long's works have an element of mystery and are written like detective stories. The protagonist, usually a formidable martial artist and intelligent problem-solver, embarks on a quest to solve a mystery such as a murder case. Huang Yi's stories are blended with science fiction. Despite these genre-blending elements, wuxia is primarily a historical genre of fiction. Notwithstanding this, wuxia writers openly admit that they are unable to capture the entire history of a course of events and instead choose to structure their stories along the pattern of the protagonist's progression from childhood to adulthood instead. The progression may be symbolic rather than literal, as observed in Jin Yong's The Smiling, Proud Wanderer, where Linghu Chong progresses from childish concerns and dalliances into much more adult ones as his unwavering loyalty repeatedly thrusts him into the rocks of betrayal at the hands of his inhumane master."

        "content": "The eight common attributes of the xia are listed as benevolence, justice, individualism, loyalty, courage, truthfulness, disregard for wealth, and desire for glory. Apart from individualism, these characteristics are similar to Confucian values such as ren (\u4ec1; \"benevolence\", \"kindness\"), zhong (\u5fe0; \"loyalty\"), yong (\u52c7; \"courage\", \"bravery\") and yi (\u7fa9; \"righteousness\"). The code of xia also emphasises the importance of repaying benefactors after having received deeds of en (\u6069; \"grace\", \"favour\") from others, as well as seeking chou (\u4ec7; \"vengeance\", \"revenge\") to bring villains to justice. However, the importance of vengeance is controversial, as a number of wuxia works stress Buddhist ideals, which include forgiveness, compassion and a prohibition on killing. In the jianghu, martial artists are expected to be loyal to their master (Shifu). This gives rise to the formation of several complex trees of master-apprentice relations as well as the various sects such as Shaolin and Wudang. If there are any disputes between fighters, they will choose the honourable way of settling their issues through fighting in duels."

        "content": "The martial arts in wuxia stories are based on wushu techniques and other real life Chinese martial arts. In wuxia tales, however, the mastery of such skills are highly exaggerated to superhuman levels of achievement and prowess. The following is a list of skills and abilities a typical fighter in a wuxia story possesses: Martial arts (\u6b66\u529f): Fighting techniques in a codified sequence called zhaoshi (\u62db\u5f0f), which are based on real life Chinese martial arts. Weapons and objects: Combatants use a wide range of weapons in combat. The most commonly used ones are the dao (broadsword or saber), jian (sword), gun (staff), and qiang (spear). Everyday objects such as abaci, benches, fans, ink brushes, smoking pipes, sewing needles, or various musical instruments, are also used as weapons as well. Qinggong (\u8f7b\u529f): A form of real Chinese martial arts. In wuxia fiction, however, its use is exaggerated to the point that characters can circumvent gravity to fly, cover tremendous distances in a single stride, run across surfaces of water, mount trees, and jump over or scale high walls. Neili (\u5185\u529b; lit \"internal force\" or \"internal strength\")/Neigong (\u5167\u529f; literally \"internal skill\" or \"internal function\"): The ability to build up and cultivate inner energy known as qi and utilise it for attack and defensive purposes. Characters use this energy to attain skills such as superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability and healing as well as the ability to project energy beams and elemental forces from their bodies. Dianxue (\u9ede\u7a74; literally \"touching acupuncture points\"): Characters use various acupuncture techniques to kill, paralyse, immobilise or even manipulate opponents by attacking their acupressure points with their bare hands or weapons. Such techniques can also be used for healing purposes, such as halting excessive bleeding. Real life martial artists do use such techniques to paralyse or stun their opponents, however, their effectiveness is highly exaggerated in wuxia stories. In wuxia stories, characters attain the above skills and abilities by devoting themselves to years of diligent study and exercise, but can also have such power conferred upon them by a master who transfers his energy to them. The instructions to mastering these skills through training are found in secret manuals known as miji (\u79d8\u7b08). In some stories, specific skills can be learned by spending several years in seclusion with a master or training with a group of fighters."

        "content": "The meaning of the term jianghu () has evolved over the course of Chinese history, but usually refers to the martial arts world of ancient China. First coined by Zhuangzi in the late 4th century BC, it referred to a way of life different from that of being actively involved in politics. At the time, it referred to the way of life of underachieving or maligned scholar-officials who distanced themselves from the circles of political power. In this sense, jianghu could be loosely interpreted as the way of life of a hermit. Over the centuries, jianghu gained greater acceptance among the common people and gradually became a term for a sub-society parallel to, and sometimes orthogonal to, mainstream society. This sub-society initially included merchants, craftsmen, beggars and vagabonds, but over time it assimilated bandits, outlaws and gangs who lived \"outside the existing law\". During the Song and Yuan dynasties, bards and novelists began using the term jianghu in the process of creating literature covering a fictional society of adventurers and rebels who lived not by existing societal laws, but by their own moral principles or extralegal code of conduct. The core of these moral principles encompassed xia (), yi (), li (), zhong () and chou (). Stories in this genre bloomed and enriched various interpretations of jianghu. At the same time, the term jianghu also developed intricate interconnections with gang culture because of outlaws' mutually shared distaste towards governments. The inclusion of martial arts as a feature of jianghu was a recent development in the early 20th century. Novelists started creating a fantasy world of jianghu in which characters are martial artists and in which the characters' enforcement of righteousness is symbolised by conflicts between different martial artists or martial arts sects and the ultimate triumph of good over evil. Martial arts became a tool used by characters in a jianghu story to enforce their moral beliefs. On the other hand, there are characters who become corrupted by power derived from their formidable prowess in martial arts and end up abandoning their morality in their pursuit of power. Around this time, the term jianghu became closely related to a similar term, wulin (), which referred exclusively to a community of martial artists. This fantasy world of jianghu remains as the mainstream definition of jianghu in modern Chinese popular culture, particularly wuxia culture."

        "content": "The following description focuses more on the martial arts aspect of jianghu, its well-established social norms, and its close relation with wulin. A common aspect of jianghu is that the courts of law are dysfunctional and that all disputes and differences (within the community) can only be resolved by members of the community, through the use of mediation, negotiation or force, predicating the need for the code of xia and acts of chivalry. Law and order within the jianghu are maintained by the various orthodox and righteous sects and heroes. Sometimes these sects may gather to form an alliance against a powerful evil organisation in the jianghu. A leader, called the wulin mengzhu (\u6b66\u6797\u76df\u4e3b; literally \"master of the wulin alliance\"), is elected from among the sects in order to lead them and ensure law and order within the jianghu. The leader is usually someone with a high level of mastery in martial arts and a great reputation for righteousness who is often involved in some conspiracy and/or killed. In some stories, the leader may not be the greatest martial artist in the jianghu; in other stories, the position of the leader is hereditary. The leader is an arbiter who presides and adjudicates over all inequities and disputes. The leader is a de jure chief justice of the affairs of the jianghu."

        "content": "Members of the jianghu are also expected to keep their distance from any government offices or officials, without necessarily being antagonistic. It was acceptable for jianghu members who are respectable members of society (usually owning properties or big businesses) to maintain respectful but formal and passive relationships with the officials, such as paying due taxes and attending local community events. Even then, they are expected to shield any fugitives from the law, or at the least not to turn over fugitives to the officials. Local officials who are savvier would know better than to expect co-operation from jianghu members and would refrain from seeking help except to apprehend the worst and most notorious criminals. If the crimes also violated some of the moral tenets of jianghu, jianghu members may assist the government officials. An interesting aspect is that while senior officials are kept at a distance, jianghu members may freely associate with low-ranking staff such as runners, jailers, or clerks of the magistrates. The jianghu members maintained order among their own in the community and prevent any major disturbance, thus saving a lot of work for their associates in the yamen. In return, the runners turn a blind eye to certain jianghu activities that are officially disapproved, the jailers ensured incarcerated jianghu members are not mistreated, and the clerks pass on useful tips to the jianghu community. This reciprocal arrangement allowed their superiors to maintain order in their jurisdiction with the limited resources available and jianghu members greater freedom."

For instance, the triads and other Chinese secret societies use the term jianghu to describe their world of organised crime. Sometimes, the term jianghu may be replaced by the term \"underworld\" \u00e0 la \"criminal underworld\". In modern terminology, jianghu may mean any circle of interest, ranging from the entertainment industry to sports. Colloquially, retirement is also referred to as \"leaving the jianghu\" (\u9000\u51fa\u6c5f\u6e56). In wuxia stories, when a reputable fighter decides to retire from the jianghu, he will do so in a ceremony known as \"washing hands in the golden basin\" (\u91d1\u76c6\u6d17\u624b). He washes his hands in a golden basin filled with water, signifying that he will no longer be involved in the affairs of the jianghu. When a reclusive fighter who has retired from the jianghu reappears, his return is described as \"re-entering the jianghu\" (\u91cd\u51fa\u6c5f\u6e56)."

Extant early wuxia films produced in China include Red Heroine (1929), Woman Warrior White Rose (1929), and Woman Warrior of the Wild River 6: Rumble at Deerhorn Gully (1930), the sixth film in a series. Hua Mu Lan (1939), another surviving film, is considered a representative of the second wave of wuxia films, during the Anti-Japanese War. Films directed by King Hu and produced by the Shaw Brothers Studio featured sophisticated action choreography using wire and trampoline assisted acrobatics combined with sped-up camera techniques. The storylines in the early films were loosely adapted from existing literature. Cheng Pei-pei, Jimmy Wang and Connie Chan are among the better known wuxia movie stars in the 1960s\u201370s, when films made by King Hu and the Shaw Brothers Studio were most prominent. More recent wuxia movie actors and actresses include Jet Li, Brigitte Lin, Michelle Yeoh, Donnie Yen, Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi. Yuen Woo-ping is a choreographer who achieved fame by crafting action-sequences in wuxia films. Wuxia was introduced to Hollywood studios in 2000 by Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, though influence of the genre was previously seen in the United States in the 1970s television series Kung Fu. Following in Lee's footsteps, Zhang Yimou made Hero, targeted for the international market in 2002, House of Flying Daggers in 2004 and Curse of the Golden Flower in 2006. Western audiences were also introduced to wuxia through Asian television stations in larger cities, which featured miniseries such as Warriors of the Yang Clan and Paradise, often with English subtitles. Western attempts at the genre have been limited, such as the 2008 film The Forbidden Kingdom, which starred Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Michael Angarano. However, a major exception is DreamWorks Animation's media franchise Kung Fu Panda. Created as an earnest, if humorous, emulation by producers who were knowledgeable admirers of the genre, the series has been particularly hailed in China as an excellent contribution to the form. More recently, 1990s\u20132000s Hong Kong stars Daniel Wu and Stephen Fung have worked with AMC Networks to bring wuxia to a US television audience with Into the Badlands, which premiered in 2015 and ran for three seasons."

To cope with her loneliness, Am\u00e9lie develops an active imagination and a mischievous personality. When Am\u00e9lie is six, her mother, Amandine, is killed when a suicidal Canadian tourist jumps from the roof of Notre-Dame de Paris and lands on her. As a result, her father Rapha\u00ebl withdraws more and more from society. Am\u00e9lie leaves home at the age of 18 and becomes a waitress at the Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins in Montmartre, which is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. She is single and lets her imagination roam freely, finding contentment in simple pleasures like dipping her hand into grain sacks, cracking cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with a spoon, and skipping stones along the Canal Saint-Martin. On 31 August 1997, startled by the news of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, Am\u00e9lie drops a plastic perfume-stopper, which dislodges a wall tile and accidentally reveals an old metal box of childhood memorabilia hidden by a boy who lived in her apartment decades earlier. Am\u00e9lie resolves to track down the boy and return the box to him. She promises herself that if it makes him happy, she will devote her life to bringing happiness to others. After asking the apartment's concierge and several old tenants about the boy's identity, Am\u00e9lie meets her reclusive neighbour, Raymond Dufayel, an artist with brittle bone disease who repaints Renoir's Luncheon of the Boating Party every year. He recalls the boy's name as \"Bretodeau\". Am\u00e9lie quickly finds the man, Dominique Bretodeau, and surreptitiously gives him the box. Moved to tears by the discovery and the memories it holds, Bretodeau resolves to reconcile with his estranged daughter and the grandson he has never met. Am\u00e9lie happily embarks on her new mission. Am\u00e9lie secretly executes complex schemes that positively affect the lives of those around her. She escorts a blind man to the M\u00e9tro station, giving him a rich description of the street scenes he passes. She persuades her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his garden gnome and having a flight attendant friend airmail pictures of it posing with landmarks from all over the world. She starts a romance between her hypochondriacal co-worker Georgette and Joseph, one of the customers in the bar. She convinces Madeleine Wallace, the concierge of her block of flats, that the husband who abandoned her had sent her a final conciliatory love letter just before his accidental death years before. She gaslights Collignon, the nasty greengrocer. Mentally exhausted, Collignon no longer abuses his meek but good-natured assistant Lucien. A delighted Lucien takes charge at the grocery stand. Mr. Dufayel, having observed Am\u00e9lie, begins a conversation with her about his painting. Although he has copied the same painting 20 times, he has never quite captured the look of the girl drinking a glass of water. They discuss the meaning of this character, and over several conversations, Am\u00e9lie begins projecting her loneliness onto the image. Dufayel recognizes this and uses the girl in the painting to push Am\u00e9lie to examine her attraction to a quirky young man, Nino Quincampoix, who collects the discarded photographs of strangers from passport photo booths. When Am\u00e9lie bumps into Nino a second time, she realizes she is falling in love with him. He accidentally drops a photo album in the street. Am\u00e9lie retrieves it. Am\u00e9lie plays a cat-and-mouse game with Nino around Paris before returning his treasured album anonymously. After arranging a meeting at the 2 Moulins, Am\u00e9lie panics and tries to deny her identity. Her co-worker, Gina, concerned for Am\u00e9lie's well-being, screens Nino for her; Joseph's comment about this misleads Am\u00e9lie to believe she has lost Nino to Gina. It takes Dufayel's insight to give her the courage to pursue Nino, resulting in a romantic night together and the beginning of a relationship. The film ends as Am\u00e9lie experiences a moment of happiness she has found for herself."

        "title": "Am\u00e9lie_Sound",
        "content": "Throughout the movie, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet delivers the whimsicality of Amelie through subtle yet consistent choices on film elements such as sound. One example to interpret such choices comes through comparison of the auditory elements of the scene where Amelie meets the booth cleaner vs the scene where Nino meets the booth cleaner. In Amelie's meeting, the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet weaves marching band-inspired rhythms with targeted sound effects and precise narration to build up anticipation for Nino and Amelie's meeting, allowing viewers to experience the weight of the scene's twist: Amelie meeting with the mysterious booth cleaner instead. A similar sonic buildup creates anticipation when Nino meets the booth cleaner, but differ in the delivery of the rhythms of the buildup and deus-ex-machina meeting switch. This distinction is made clear by the rhythmic buildup of a marching band vs ambient 808's, and the confusion tied together by discordancies upon the final reveal. The sonic buildup in Amelie's scene uses marching band beats to convey a sense of control, yet the buildup in Nino's scene consists of scattered inconsistencies that still lead to a similar anticipation. In both scenes, the sound gets faster and more layered as the audience excitedly awaits a possible meeting between Amelie and Nino, until a climax where the tones slow and completely change character, foreshadowing each's meeting with the booth cleaner instead of their counterpart. In Amelie's scene, trumpets blare for each poster she tears down. Slow yet booming drum beats connect her preparation stops before the train station, and a snare beat begins as Nino walks towards her. Nino's footsteps morph into drums with heartbeat-like reverb that speed up as he gets closer, mimicking the audience's faster beating heart. The energy suddenly breaks as the beat slows, pitches down, and distorts, and we get the sense something is wrong as THX-like 808 drums build up in the background. One solitary drumbeat closes the marching band analogy as Amelie opens the curtain to the man's reveal. A marching band theme could be a way to recall planned coordination of hundreds of musicians, the same way Amelie conducts and coordinates the world around her to a coherent vision. This coordination is further emphasized when Nino's plotline is left dangling and unfinished, a victim of Amelie's world. On the other hand, Nino's buildup is a potpourri of sounds. Ominous 808s give way to creepy snake rattling, then high pitched vibrating wind noises. A lower pitched oboe leads to a jarring screech out of 'The Shining's hotel, then gong hits swap to screeches from a train stopping. A final THX-like 808 builds up tension until the man is revealed and he puts his tools away, and the final drum smash gives way to the classic lighthearted French sound track of Yann Tiersen until Amelie's cart interruption. This disconnected energy emphasizes how Nino is reactive to the chaos of the world around him, mirroring him being strung along by Amelie and photo booth folk. After the buildup, the two scenes have a similarly inharmonious conclusion that uses sound to convey Amelie's mental anguish. In Amelie's scene, the door opens to a crack of thunder, while paper ripping reminds us of the scrapbook, all underlaid on an ominous and constant high pitched shrill. It ends with a loud dong and then immediately swaps to an angelic orchestral chant. The angels and skyward thunder invoke the concept of deus ex machina, the only explanation for the last-second scene swap. This disharmony is one of the first hints that even Amelie's best laid plans can fall into disarray, and surprise the audience while cushioning from the buildup. In Nino's scene, the disharmony comprises the whole buildup, but crescendoes when Amelie is stopped by beeps from a train, and her mindset is caricatured through deep drumbeats and backwards clock ticking, as Amelie turns to see Nino has disappeared. This 180 from the joyous piano of Yann Tiersen make us intimately aware of how Amelie's doubt in her plans is a self-fulfilling prophecy, using noises to emphasize Amelie's inharmonious mental state as nervousness overtakes her confidence and wastes her plans. While the two scenes share many structural similarities in sonic buildup and outcome, there is a stark difference in the sonic consistency of the elements used to create the anticipation, tension, and resolution. Amelie's scene contains a litany of marching band rhythmic consistency sharply violated by a deus ex machina of sound, while Nino's builds up unrelated sounds to crescendo to calmness interrupted by jarring sounds of Amelie's mental confusion. Attention to such sound allows viewers to foresee the twists of the film, and paying attention to the consistency of choices that inform our feelings add to the emotional impact of these choreographed sequences."

        "title": "Am\u00e9lie_Mise-en-scene",
        "content": "The scene where Amelie plucks a stone from the ground in front of the Train Fantome ride is a great analysis for mise-en-scene. It is full of juxtapositions of color and light that emphasize the unique beauty that Amelie chooses to see within the world. In this scene (and throughout the movie), Amelie's red starkly contrasts the sea of green, brown, and yellow behind her, separating her perspective from that of the world's. Mise-en-scene manifests in darkness as well, when she plucks a stone out of indistinct shadows -- camera motion emphasizes how she blows out the grime like a reverse wish on a birthday candle. She stares wistfully into the darkness of the ride, and watchers should hardly be surprised that she foresees love inside the gloomy interior of the ghost ride: foreshadowing sexual tension at the touch of Nino, instead of screams. The scene opens with a decision that the filmmaker opts for throughout the movie -- that to dress Amelie in red, along with elements closely associated with her uniquely positive perspective. The ride name and Amelie's dress provide the red for the scene -- the rest of the ride is drenched in greens and yellows with only faintly red highlights. While the ride name was likely a choice more dependent on the set, Amelie's red dress and pink shirt intentionally contrast her from the scene without her in it, demonstrating how she doesn't quite fit in. We expect her to bring this singular brightness inside the darkness of the ride area as well, and we are not let down. From that darkness, the filmmakers add meaning to light via the stone. Upon seeing Nino's bike in the first pan-down, a watcher might guess Amelie would first engage with that object; instead, the filmmaker clearly opts for her to focus on a rock that isn't even perceptible in the mise-en-scene till she picks it up. The blackness of the ground, the tires, and her shoes give shadow vibes that starkly contrast the bright ride from just a second prior -- from this indistinct, oft-ignored screen space, Amelie grabs a stone, reminiscent of her skipping stones from throughout the movie. While we would expect her to skip it or pocket it, she first instead appreciates the smoothness as she rotates it in her knuckles, then blows the dust out like she's wishing on a birthday candle. Her diamond in the rough mentality is highlighted as she chooses a dirty stone then lightly asserts her influence -- her light breath is as invisible as her elaborate schemes, but her wishes become real in a way only she can vivify. The imagery of blowing out darkness to reveal the light of the stone, instead of the light of a candle to reveal a burnt wick, further highlights Amelie's unique methods to track down Nino in the darkened ride. Finally, the lighted regions that the director highlights between patches of darkness point to the way that compelling contrast of scene composition emphasize Amelie's unique take. Had the ground been fully lighted, we may have spotted the stone before Amelie, or not seen as clearly how Amelie finds pleasures in places we never even think to look. Had the interior of the ride been lighted, we would not have expected her to find the same value within the darkness of the ride. Had it been nighttime, we would not have noticed the parallel between the ride area and the ground. Had her dress or the bike been under the same three point lighting as her head, we would not have focused our attention on the slow kneading of the stone within her knuckles. The director has used darkness not just as a path for Amelie to blaze her way through, but as a contrast to emphasize what he is trying to highlight in the absence of it. Throughout the scene before entering the theme park ride, the shot emphasizes elements of mise-en-scene through its use of color and light, to lead a viewer to foreshadow the journey that Amelie will undertake within the ride. From the stark juxtaposition of her red dress, Amelie has set us up to violate expectations. As she picks up a stone and blows it off, she unveils the beauty hidden from the viewers, then breaks our expectations of darkness again and again as she stands brightly within it. The contrast of colors allow a viewer to foresee Amelie's upcoming pleasure with Nino inside the ride."

        "content": "Musically, A Hard Day's Night eschews the rock and roll cover songs of the band's previous albums for a predominantly pop sound. Sputnikmusic's Dave Donnelly observes \"short, peppy\" pop songs characterised by layered vocals, immediate choruses, and understated instrumentation. According to Pitchfork's Tom Ewing, the lack of rock and roll covers allows listeners to \"take the group's new sound purely on its own modernist terms\", with audacious \"chord choices\", powerful harmonies, \"gleaming\" guitar, and \"Northern\" harmonica. Music journalist Robert Christgau writes that Lennon\u2013McCartney's songs were \"more sophisticated musically\" than before. It also features lead guitarist George Harrison playing a Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar, a sound that was influential on the Byrds and other bands in the folk rock explosion of 1965. Side one of the LP contains the songs from the film soundtrack. Side two contains songs written for, but not included in, the film, although a 1980s re-release of the film includes a prologue before the opening credits with \"I'll Cry Instead\" on the soundtrack. The title of the album and film was the accidental creation of drummer Ringo Starr. According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine: \"I was going home in the car and [film director] Dick Lester suggested the title, 'Hard Day's Night' from something Ringo had said. I had used it in In His Own Write, but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those malapropisms. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny\u00a0... just said it. So Dick Lester said, 'We are going to use that title.'\" A Hard Day's Night is the first Beatles album to feature entirely original compositions, and the only one where all the songs were written by Lennon\u2013McCartney. Lennon is the primary author of nine of the thirteen tracks on the album, as well as being the lead singer on these same nine tracks (although Paul McCartney sings lead on the title track's middle-eight). Lennon and McCartney co-wrote \"I'm Happy Just to Dance with You\", sung by Harrison, while McCartney wrote \"And I Love Her\", \"Can't Buy Me Love\" and \"Things We Said Today\". It is one of three Beatles albums, along with Let It Be and Magical Mystery Tour, in which Starr does not sing lead vocal on any songs. (Starr sang the lead vocal on \"Matchbox\" during the sessions; it appeared instead on the Long Tall Sally EP.) It is also one of three Beatles albums, along with Please Please Me and Beatles for Sale, in which Harrison does not contribute to the songwriting."

        "content": "George Harrison's resonant 12-string electric guitar leads [on A Hard's Day's Night] were hugely influential; the movie helped persuade the Byrds, then folksingers, to plunge all out into rock & roll, and the Beatles would be hugely influential on the folk-rock explosion of 1965. The Beatles' success, too, had begun to open the US market for fellow English bands like the Rolling Stones, the Animals, and the Kinks, and inspired young American groups like the Beau Brummels, Lovin' Spoonful, and others to mount a challenge of their own with self-penned material that owed a great debt to Lennon\u2013McCartney. In his book Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!: The Story of Pop Music from Bill Haley to Beyonc\u00e9, Bob Stanley identifies A Hard Day's Night as the album that best captures the band's early-career appeal. He writes: If you had to explain the Beatles' impact to a stranger, you'd play them the soundtrack to A Hard Day's Night. The songs, conceived in a hotel room in a spare couple of weeks between up-ending the British class system and conquering America, were full of bite and speed. There was adventure, knowingness, love, and abundant charm. A Hard Day's Night was included in the list of \"100 Essential Rock Albums\" compiled by musicologists Charlie Gillett and Simon Frith for ZigZag magazine in 1975, and is one of the \"Treasure Island albums\" featured in Greil Marcus's 1979 book Stranded. In 2000, Q magazine placed A Hard Day's Night at number 5 on its list \"The 100 Greatest British Albums Ever\". That same year, it appeared at number 22 in Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked it 307th on the magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In the 2020 revision, it rose to number 263. A Hard Day's Night has also appeared in critics' lists of the best albums of all time published by the NME, in 1974 (at number 33), 1985 (number 73) and 2013 (number 195); Mojo, in 1995 (number 81); and Uncut, in 2016 (number 149).

The album went to number one on the Billboard album chart, spending 14 weeks there, the longest run of any album that year. United Artists rushed the album into stores over a month before the film's US premiere; as a result, the Beatles had both the number-one album and number-one single in the country when A Hard Day's Night opened on 11 August 1964. All seven songs from the film, the first side of the UK album, were featured along with \"I'll Cry Instead\", which, although written for the film, was cut at the last minute. The American version also included four easy listening-styled instrumental versions of Lennon and McCartney songs arranged by George Martin conducting an orchestra of studio musicians: \"I Should Have Known Better\", \"And I Love Her\", \"Ringo's Theme\", and \"A Hard Day's Night\". After EMI acquired United Artists Records, this album was reissued in August 1980 on the Capitol label, catalogue SW-11921. While the stereo version of the album included the instrumental tracks in true stereo, the Beatles' own recordings appeared as electronically rechannelled stereo recordings made from the mono releases. The 1980 Capitol Records reissue used the same master tape as the original United Artists LP release in fake stereo, despite the availability of several tracks with official true stereo remixes. True stereo versions of most of the songs had been issued on the Capitol album Something New, released in July 1964. \"Can't Buy Me Love\" and \"I Should Have Known Better\" finally appeared in stereo on the 1970 Apple Records compilation Hey Jude. The song \"A Hard Day's Night\" did not appear in true stereo in the US until the 1982 Capitol compilation album Reel Music. In 2014, the American version of the \"A Hard Day's Night\" album was released on CD individually and in a boxed set of all the other US Beatles albums to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Beatles first US visit.

It was Verdi's penultimate opera, first performed at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan, on 5 February 1887. The composer was reluctant to write anything new after the success of Aida in 1871, and he retreated into retirement. It took his Milan publisher Giulio Ricordi the next ten years, first to encourage the revision of Verdi's 1857 Simon Boccanegra by introducing Boito as librettist and then to begin the arduous process of persuading and cajoling Verdi to see Boito's completed libretto for Otello in July/August 1881. However, the process of writing the first drafts of the libretto and the years of their revision, with Verdi all along not promising anything, dragged on. It wasn't until 1884, five years after the first drafts of the libretto, that composition began, with most of the work finishing in late 1885. When it finally premiered in Milan on 5\u00a0February 1887, it proved to be a resounding success, and further stagings of Otello soon followed at leading theatres throughout Europe and America."

        "title": "Otello_Verdi's intended retirement",
        "content": "After the completion and premiere of his opera Aida in December 1871, Verdi decided that it was time for him to end his successful career as a composer of opera, much as Rossini had done after the completion of the opera William Tell, though he was easily the most popular, and possibly the wealthiest, composer in Italy at the time. However, Verdi's sixties were not good years: as musicologist Julian Budden notes, \"he seemed to have entered [those years] in a mood of gloom and depression [..and..] his letters at the time were full of complaints about the Italian theatre, Italian politics and Italian music in general [all] seen by him as sinking beneath a tide of Germanism\". Because of the immense popularity of Verdi's music in Italy by the 1870s, Verdi's retirement seemed to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, to be a waste of talent and possible profits. Thus a plot of sorts was hatched in order to coax the composer out of retirement to write another opera. Because of the importance of the dramatic aspects of opera to the composer, Verdi was especially selective in his choice of subjects. Consequently, if he were to agree to create another opera after a decade of retirement, the libretto would need to be one that would capture his interest. During the period when a suitable story was being sought for what became Aida, Ricordi had come across Boito's partly finished libretto of his own opera Nerone, and he even suggested in a letter of February 1870 to Verdi that, with Boito's permission, he set it to music. Verdi ignored it, and so Ricordi tried again in January 1871, enclosing with his letter a copy of Boito's libretto for Boito's friend and collaborator Franco Faccio's Amleto which had been given in 1865 and was revived in February 1871. Nothing came of this approach, although Ricordi persevered in various ways, as seen by the composer's gruff response to the publisher's statement \"The whole salvation of the theatre and the art is in your hands\" when Verdi wrote in April 1875 that \"I cannot take it as but a joke\", continuing with \"Oh no, never fear, composers for the theatre will never be lacking\". Verdi's refusals continued as the 1870s progressed. Knowing of his interest in the soprano Adelina Patti, Ricordi tried to entice him into writing an opera for her, but Verdi's refusal resulted in another approach via a letter to the composer's wife Giuseppina, who was to present the idea at an opportune time. But she confessed defeat yet again. Clara Maffei also tried, unsuccessfully, in March 1878 to interest Verdi, who replied: \"For what reason should I write? What would I succeed in doing?\" While he was attempting to get Verdi involved a new opera, in May 1879 Ricordi also tried to engage the composer in revising Simon Boccanegra. This suggestion, originally expressed ten years before but ignored, was once again shrugged off by Verdi, who sent a note saying that the 1857 score, which had been sent to the composer for review, would remain untouched \"just as you sent it to me\". Persisting with further attempts to convince the composer, Ricordi had also broached the idea of a collaboration with Boito for a new opera based on Shakespeare's Othello. Verdi admired the dramatic works of Shakespeare and had, throughout his career, desired to create operas based on his plays, although his one attempt at doing so, Macbeth in 1847, although initially successful, was not well received when revised for performance in Paris in 1865. Because of its relatively straightforward story, the play Othello was selected as a likely target. Collaborations with Boito in the revision of the 1857 opera Simon Boccanegra helped to convince Verdi of Boito's ability as a librettist. Musicologist Roger Parker speculates that Verdi's final agreement to revise Boccanegra was based on a desire to \"test the possibility\" of working with Boito before possibly embarking on the larger project. Frank Walker expresses much the same thoughts, noting that \"some of the results, such as the magnificent scene in the Council Chamber and the villainous Paolo's Iago-like recitatives, foreshadow the later opera.\""

Finally, after some plotting, Ricordi, in conjunction with Verdi's friend, the conductor Franco Faccio, subtly introduced the idea of a new opera to Verdi. During a dinner at Verdi's Milan residence during the summer of 1879, Ricordi and Faccio guided the conversation towards Shakespeare's play Othello and to the librettist Arrigo Boito (whom Ricordi claimed to be a great fan of the play also). Ricordi told the story to Giuseppe Adami, a librettist for three of Puccini's operas:The idea of a new opera arose during a dinner among friends, when I turned the conversation, by chance, on Shakespeare and on Boito. At the mention of Othello I saw Verdi fix his eyes on me, with suspicion, but with interest. He had certainly understood; he had certainly reacted. I believed the time was ripe. Suggestions were made, despite initial skepticism on the part of the composer, that Boito would be interested in creating a new libretto based upon the play. Within several days, Ricordi approached Verdi with the request that he would like to visit Sant' Agata \"with a friend\" in September. Verdi's reaction was clearly non-committal: \"I wish absolutely to avoid committing myself [...] The best thing ... is for him to send me the finished poem\". Meanwhile, Boito began work on the libretto in spite of illness and, by late October/early November had sent a copy of the work so far. After appealing to Giuseppina, Ricordi was told that the Verdis would be coming to Milan and that he would meet privately with Boito. However, she noted in her letter of 7 November: \"Between ourselves, what Boito has so far written of the African seems to please him, and is very well done.\" At this point the opera was being referred to as Iago rather than Otello, due to the tradition\u2014\"an unwritten law of the theatre\"\u2014that any new opera would have a new title rather than that of one still in the repertoire, in this case by Rossini."

        "content": "The process of writing the first drafts of the libretto and the years of their revision, with Verdi all along not promising anything, dragged on. As Walker charts it, the opera was completed:in three comparatively short bouts of composition: the first, very brief, was at Genoa in March 1884 [five years after the first drafts of the libretto began!]; the second, the principal one, at Genoa from December 1884 to April 1885; the third at Sant' Agata from the middle of September to early October 1885. By late August 1881, it appears that the text of the finale of act 3, over which there had been some considerable discussion (with ideas exchanged between both men) was sent to Verdi, who responded in a long letter from Milan regarding his feelings about its overall structure, the role of the chorus, and other issues. Throughout 1882 and 1883 very little happened, although during the winter of 1883 Verdi and Boito met in Genoa where the Verdis spent their winters, but it prompted Ricordi for three Christmases in a row to send a cake to Verdi with the figure of the Moor\u2014in chocolate\u2014on the top. In order to keep information about the composition within the group, this gesture may have been the cause for the name given to the project for many years, \"chocolate\", as in Boito's letter of 1864 noting that \"the manufacture of chocolate was going ahead\". Early the following year, Verdi began to compose and on 20 March 1884, in a letter from Boito to Ricordi, the librettist announced that Verdi had begun with the \"opening of first act and seems to be working with fervor\". There then occurred an event which unsettled both Verdi and Boito, and which nearly caused the project to come to a complete stop. While attending a banquet in Naples following the successful presentation of his opera Mefistofele, Boito gave an interview to a journalist and, in trying to keep information about the proposed Otello as quiet as possible, appears to have been misquoted by another journalist who overheard part of the conversation. The key point was that Boito, himself a composer, appeared to want to compose the music for Otello himself. When Verdi read this in a Milan newspaper, he was horrified and, in a letter to Faccio (rather than directly confronting Boito) stated that he wanted Faccio to directly tell the librettist that \"I will give him his manuscript intact, without a shadow of resentment, without rancor of any kind\". When he heard of the newspaper report, Boito was horrified. Writing immediately to Verdi, he states:The theme and my libretto are yours by right of conquest. You alone can set Othello to music\u2014all the dramatic creations you have given us proclaim the truth. [He continues by discussing his own preoccupation with Emperor Nero and his love for the period of Ancient Roman history, pointing to his ongoing work on his own opera, Nerone] ... no other subject in the world can distract me, not even Shakespeare's Othello, could distract me from my theme.[He asks the composer, given the above comments, whether he really believes that he would accept his offer. Boito begs Verdi to not to abandon Otello:] It is predestined for you.  Create it. You had begun work upon it [so..] take up you pen again and write me soon: 'Dear Boito, do me the favour of altering these verses, etc. etc...' Verdi's response, which came right away was quite blunt: in addition to complaining of his age, his years of service, and raising other objections, he states: \"The conclusion is that all this has cast a chill over this Otello, and stiffened the hand that had begun to trace out a few bars!\", but, in total contrast, Boito appears to have simply decided to carry on. Albeit \"somewhat disquieted\", he immediately proposes \"a sort of evil Credo [which] I did... for my own comfort and personal satisfaction, because I felt the need of doing it\". On 3 May, Verdi wrote back, calming this down: \"Most beautiful this Credo; most powerful and wholly Shakespearian... it would be well to leave this Otello in peace for a bit ... [and encouraging Boito to come to Sant'Agata where] \"we shall be able to talk it over again, and by then with the necessary calm\". Boito did visit Verdi in September for three days. \"It seems impossible, but it's true all the same! I'm busy, writing!! ... without purpose, without worries, without thinking of what will happen next...\" So Verdi wrote to Boito, with a request for a few more lines for act two, to which the librettist immediately responded: \"One can't escape one's destiny, and by a law of intellectual affinity that tragedy of Shakespeare's is predestined for you\". Verdi's second burst of creative energy lasted until mid-April 1885, and was followed by the usual summer break and a lack of any activity. He confesses to Boito in a letter of 10 September of that year, when he invites him to come to Sant'Agata the following Sunday, stating \"since I've been here [from the end of April] (I blush to say it) I've done nothing!\" It was during this time that the fourth act was pulled together. Walker speculates that Boito's visit and his conversations with the composer must have had some effect on Verdi because, on 5 October, Verdi made the announcement: \"I have finished the fourth act, and I breathe again\". Scoring took another year which, from January 1886 onward, involved the librettist in re-writes and additions at Verdi's request. It was at this time that it was decided to call the opera Otello rather than Iago (as noted above). Verdi's letter to Boito in January settles the matter: \"I would find it hypocritical not to call it Otello. Emanuele Muzio (Verdi's long-time assistant) tells Ricordi in March that the love duet in act 1 was finished and performed. In May, Verdi \"hit upon the precise form of one of the most famous entrances in all opera\" \u2013 Otello's \"Esultate\" \u2013 in act 1. Boito modified his verses accordingly. Other minor changes and proposed revisions were wrapped up into September so that Verdi could write to Ricordi on 9 September: \"Tomorrow I shall send to Casa Ricordi, completely finished, all the first act and all scene vi of the third; and thus with the fourth, already sent, perhaps three-fifths of the Moor are ready\". But on 1 November 1886, in a laconic communication, Verdi was able to proclaim: \"DEAR BOITO, It is finished! All honour to us! (and to Him!!). Farewell. G. VERDI\".(sic) This left only a few minor tweaks to be done, with Boito providing two more lines in December and Verdi writing to him on the 18th saying \"I have just consigned to [Ricordi] the last acts of Otello! Poor Othello!... He won't come back here any more!!!\" The librettist replied: \"The Moor will come back no more to knock on the door of the Palazzo Doria [Verdi's Genoa residence], but you will go to meet the Moor at La Scala. Otello exists. The great dream has become reality\"."

        "content": "As the Italian public became aware that the retired Verdi was composing another opera, rumors about it abounded. At the same time, many of the most illustrious conductors, singers and opera-house managers in Europe were vying for an opportunity to play a part in Otellos premiere, despite the fact that Faccio and La Scala, Milan, had already been selected as the conductor and the venue for the first performance. The two male protagonists had been selected, too: Italy's foremost dramatic tenor, Francesco Tamagno, was to sing Otello while the esteemed French singing-actor Victor Maurel would assume the villainous baritone role of Iago. Romilda Pantaleoni, a well-known singing-actress, was assigned Desdemona's soprano part. Upon the completion of the opera, preparations for the initial performance were conducted in absolute secrecy and Verdi reserved the right to cancel the premiere up to the last minute. In particular, the composer expressed reservations about Tamagno's softer singing, though not about the power and ring of his vocalism in dramatic passages of the score. Verdi need not have worried: Otellos debut proved to be a resounding success. The audience's enthusiasm for Verdi was shown by the 20 curtain calls that he took at the end of the opera. Further stagings of Otello soon followed at leading theatres throughout Europe and America."

        "content": "Since the three leading roles of the opera (Otello, Desdemona and Iago) are among Verdi's most demanding, both vocally and dramatically, some of the most illustrious singers of the past 130 years have made Otello part of their repertoire. Famous Otellos of the past have included Tamagno, the role's trumpet-voiced creator, as well as Giovanni Battista De Negri, Albert Alvarez, Francesc Vi\u00f1as, Giuseppe Borgatti, Antonio Paoli, Giovanni Zenatello, Renato Zanelli, Giovanni Martinelli, Aureliano Pertile, Francesco Merli, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi, Frank Mullings, Leo Slezak, Jose Luccioni, Ram\u00f3n Vinay, Mario Del Monaco, James McCracken, Jon Vickers, David Rendall, Jeffrey Lawton and Carlo Cossutta. Pre-Second World War Wagnerian tenors such as Jacques Urlus, Heinrich Knote, Alexander Kirchner, Lauritz Melchior and Franz V\u00f6lker also undertook the part (usually singing it in German). The Russian heroic tenor Ivan Yershov was a renowned pre-World War I Otello in his native country. His compatriot Arnold Azrikan achieved his greatest recognition as a dramatic tenor in Otello. For this performance he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1946. Enrico Caruso was studying Otello when he died unexpectedly in 1921, thus thwarting the New York Metropolitan Opera company's plans to stage the opera as a new vehicle for its star tenor. Currently, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo has appeared in more video productions of the opera than any other tenor. Also, he has recorded the complete role several times on CD and appeared in numerous stage productions of the work on both sides of the Atlantic. In his book My First Forty Years, Domingo has written about different approaches over the years towards singing the role of Otello:As to the other question \u2014 that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, we ought not to be singing \u2014 I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired. A long lineage of renowned baritones have sung Iago since 1887. Among them: Victor Maurel (the role's first exponent), Mattia Battistini, Mario Ancona, Antonio Scotti, Titta Ruffo, Pasquale Amato, Carlo Galeffi and Lawrence Tibbett. Leading post-war exponents of the part have included Giuseppe Valdengo, Leonard Warren, Robert Merrill, Tito Gobbi, Sherrill Milnes and James Morris. Many lyric sopranos have also sung the role of Desdemona since 1887, including Renata Tebaldi (1954), Leonie Rysanek (1960), Gwyneth Jones (1968), Mirella Freni (1974), Kiri Te Kanawa (1974), Margaret Price (1977), Renata Scotto (1978), Katia Ricciarelli (1985), Cheryl Studer (1993), Ren\u00e9e Fleming (1996) and Sonya Yoncheva (2015)."

On a stormy evening, the people of Cyprus anxiously await the arrival of the new governor, Otello, from a naval battle with the Turks (Chorus, Montano, Cassio, Iago, Roderigo: Una vela! / \"A sail!\"). For a moment it seems as if Otello's ship will founder, to the delight of Otello's treacherous ensign, Iago, but Otello arrives safely and announces that the Turkish fleet has been destroyed, and the Cypriots cheer (Otello, chorus: Esultate! L'orgoglio musulmano sepolto \u00e8 in mar / \"Rejoice! The Muslim\u2019s pride is buried in the sea\"). Iago offers to help the young Venetian gentleman Roderigo in his seduction of Otello's wife, Desdemona \u2013 Iago envies Otello his success and longs to destroy the Moor (Iago, Roderigo: Roderigo, ebben che pensi? / \"Well, Roderigo, what are you thinking?\"). Among his grievances, Iago is outraged that Otello has appointed Cassio to be the captain of the navy, a position that Iago hoped to have. The people of Cyprus celebrate the safe return of Otello and his men by lighting a bonfire and drinking (Chorus: Fuoco di gioia!/ \"Fire of joy\"). Iago proposes a toast to Otello and his wife, while Cassio praises Desdemona (Iago, Cassio, Chorus, Roderigo: Roderigo, beviam! / \"Roderigo, let's drink!\"). Iago offers Cassio more wine, but Cassio says he has had enough. Iago pressures him and offers a toast to Otello and Desdemona. Cassio gives in. Iago sings a drinking song and continues to pour Cassio wine (Iago, Cassio, Roderigo, chorus: Inaffia l'ugola! / \"Wet your throat\"). Montano enters and calls for Cassio to begin his watch; he is surprised to find Cassio drunk and barely able to stand upright. Iago lies to Montano, telling him that this is how Cassio spends every evening. Roderigo laughs at Cassio's drunkenness and Cassio attacks him. Montano tells Cassio to calm down, but Cassio draws his sword and threatens to crack open Montano's head. (Montano, Cassio, Iago, Roderigo, chorus: Capitano, v'attende la fazione ai baluardi / \"Captain, the guard awaits you on the ramparts\".) Cassio and Montano begin to duel, and Iago sends Roderigo to call the alarm. Montano is wounded and the fight is stopped only by the appearance of Otello. Otello orders Montano and Cassio to lower their swords. He then asks \"honest Iago\" to explain how the duel began, but Iago says he doesn't know. Otello then turns to Cassio, who is embarrassed and cannot excuse his actions. When Otello discovers that Montano is wounded, he becomes enraged. Desdemona enters, and, upon seeing that his bride's rest has been disturbed, Otello declares that Cassio is no longer Captain. (Otello, Iago, Cassio, Montano: Abbasso le spade / \"Down with your swords\".) He tells Iago to patrol the town to restore quiet, calls for help for Montano and orders everyone to return to their houses. The Cypriots leave Otello alone with Desdemona. Together Otello and Desdemona recall why they fell in love. Otello, in an ecstasy of joy, invites death, fearing that he will never know such happiness again. Desdemona prays that their love will remain unchanged. They kiss, overcome with love for each other.

Desdemona and Emilia can be seen walking the garden. Cassio approaches Desdemona. Watching from the room, Iago voices his nihilistic beliefs and hatred of humankind (Credo in un Dio crudel / \"I believe in a cruel God\"). Otello enters the room; Iago, pretending not to notice him, says that he is deeply troubled. Cassio sees Otello from afar and goes discreetly away. Otello asks what's wrong, but Iago gives only vague answers. Finally, he hints that Cassio and Desdemona are having an affair. Otello begins to get suspicious, but declares that he needs proof before believing that Desdemona has been unfaithful. (Iago, Otello: Ci\u00f2 m'accora... Che parli? / \"That worries me...\" \"What did you say?\") Iago warns Otello against jealousy, but also advises him to be vigilant. A crowd of children, sailors, and Cypriots sing to Desdemona, praising her beauty and purity (Chorus, Iago, children, Desdemona, Otello: Dove guardi splendono raggi / \"Wherever you look, brightness shines...\"). They present her with gifts and wish her happiness before leaving. Desdemona carries Cassio's request for reinstatement to Otello. Otello sourly tells her to ask him another time; as she persists, he grows impatient and says he has a headache. Desdemona offers to wrap his head in a handkerchief Otello once gave her, linen embroidered with strawberries. Otello throws it to the ground and says he doesn't need it (Desdemona, Otello: D'un uom che geme sotto il tuo disdegno la preghiera ti porto / \"I bring a petition from one who suffers under your displeasure\"). Emilia picks up the handkerchief. Desdemona asks for Otello's forgiveness. Aside, Iago demands that Emilia give him the handkerchief. When she refuses, Iago forcibly takes it from her. Otello dismisses the others, and declares that he now believes that Desdemona may be deceiving him (Otello: Ora e per sempre addio sante memorie / \"Now and forever farewell, holy memories\"). Iago returns, and the jealous Otello demands proof of Desdemona's infidelity. Iago says that once, when he and Cassio were sleeping in the same room, he heard Cassio talking to Desdemona in a dream. In the dream, says Iago, Cassio told Desdemona that they must be careful to conceal their love. (Iago: Era la notte, Cassio dormia / \"It was night, Cassio was sleeping\".) Iago says that dreams don't prove anything, but remarks that he saw Cassio carrying Desdemona's strawberry-embroidered handkerchief just the day before. Otello swears vengeance on Desdemona and Cassio, and Iago joins him in his vow (Otello, Iago: S\u00ec, pel ciel marmoreo giuro / \"Yes, by the marble heavens I swear\")."

Desdemona enters and reminds Otello of Cassio's request. Otello says that his headache has returned, and asks Desdemona to wrap her handkerchief around his head. When Desdemona produces a different handkerchief, Otello demands the one with strawberries. When she says she does not have it, Otello says that it was a talisman, and troubles will befall her if she loses it. Desdemona says that he is trying to ignore Cassio's plea, and as she asks him about Cassio, he demands the handkerchief ever more insistently. (Desdemona, Otello: Dio ti giocondi, o sposo / \"God keep you merry, husband\".) Desdemona protests that she is faithful; Otello sends her away (Desdemona, Otello: Esterrefatta fisso lo sguardo tuo tremendo / \"Terrified, I face your dreadful look\").

As Cassio laughs about his romantic adventures, Otello assumes he is speaking of Desdemona. In a conversation only partially heard, Cassio seems to be telling Iago that another woman, a secret admirer, left him a handkerchief as a token. At Iago's urging, Cassio produces it, whereupon Iago seizes it\u2014for it is Desdemona's\u2014and holds it out where he knows Otello can see it. He then returns it to Cassio and teases him, while in his hiding place Otello fumes (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Questa \u00e8 una ragna dove il tuo cuor casca / \"This is a spiderweb in which your heart is caught\"). Bugles sound, announcing the arrival of the Venetian ambassador, Lodovico. Iago warns Cassio that he should leave unless he wants to see Otello. Cassio exits, and Otello asks Iago how he should kill his wife. Iago advises Otello to kill Desdemona by suffocating her in her bed, while he will take care of Cassio. Otello promotes Iago to Captain. Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, Roderigo, and other dignitaries enter. When Lodovico notes Cassio's absence, Iago tells him that Cassio is out of favor. Desdemona interrupts, telling Lodovico that she hopes he will soon be restored. Otello calls her a demon and almost strikes her violently but is held back by Lodovico. Otello then calls for Cassio. (Lodovico, Otello, Desdemona, Emilia, Iago, chorus: Il Doge ed il Senato salutano l'eroe trionfatore / \"The Doge and the Senate greet the triumphant hero\".) Cassio enters and Otello reads (mixing in insults to Desdemona) a letter from the Doge, announcing that he (Otello) has been called back to Venice and Cassio is to succeed him as governor of Cyprus. Enraged, Otello throws Desdemona to the ground. (Otello, Roderigo, Iago, Cassio, Lodovico: Messeri! il Doge mi richiama a Venezia / \"Gentlemen! The Doge recalls me to Venice\".) Desdemona, on the ground, laments (A terra! \u2026 s\u00ec \u2026 nel livido fango / \"Fallen! yes, in the foul mud...\"). The various characters express their feelings: Emilia and Lodovico express their sympathy for Desdemona, Cassio marvels at his sudden change of fortune, and Roderigo laments that Desdemona will soon depart. In separate asides, Iago urges Otello to take his revenge as soon as possible, while he will take care of Cassio. He advises Roderigo that the only way to prevent Desdemona from leaving is for Cassio, the new Duke, to die, and suggests that Roderigo murder Cassio that night. (Emilia, Cassio, Desdemona, Roderigo, Lodovico, Iago, Otello, chorus: Quell'innocente un fremito d'odio non ha n\u00e8 un gesto / \"That innocent one is without feeling or gesture of hatred\"). In a fury, Otello orders everyone to leave. Desdemona goes to comfort him, but Lodovico pulls her away as Otello curses her. As the others leave, Otello raves about the handkerchief, then collapses. Outside, the crowd of Cypriots hails the victory and glory for Otello, whom they call \"the Lion of Venice\".  Iago presses Otello's forehead with his heel, and snarls, with contemptuous irony: \"Ecco il Leone! (\"This is the lion!\"), and then walks away.

Before he dies, he drags himself next to his wife and kisses her (Otello: Un bacio...un bacio ancora...ah!...un altro bacio... / A kiss.. another kiss...ah...and yet another kiss). He lies dead next to Desdemona."

        "content": "Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented is a novel by Thomas Hardy. It initially appeared in a censored and serialised version, published by the British illustrated newspaper The Graphic in 1891, then in book form in three volumes in 1891, and as a single volume in 1892. Though now considered a major 19th-century English novel, even Hardy's fictional masterpiece, Tess of the d'Urbervilles received mixed reviews when it first appeared, in part because it challenged the sexual morals of late Victorian England. Tess was portrayed as a fighter not only for her rights, but also for the rights of others."

        "content": "The novel is set in an impoverished rural England, Thomas Hardy's fictional Wessex, during the Long Depression of the 1870s. Tess is the oldest child of John and Joan Durbeyfield, uneducated peasants. However, John is given the impression by Parson Tringham that he may have noble blood, as \"Durbeyfield\" is a corruption of \"D'Urberville\", the surname of an extinct noble Norman family. Knowledge of this immediately goes to John's head. That same day, Tess participates in the village May Dance, where she first sees Angel Clare, youngest son of Reverend James Clare. Angel is on a walking tour with his two brothers, but stops to join the dance and partners several other girls. He notices Tess too late to dance with her, as he is already late in returning to his brothers. Tess feels slighted. Tess's father gets too drunk to drive a load of beehives to a neighbouring town that night and so Tess undertakes the journey herself with a younger brother. However, she falls asleep at the reins and the family's only horse, Prince, encounters a speeding wagon and is fatally injured. Tess feels so guilty at Prince's death and the economic consequences for the family that she agrees, against her better judgement, to visit Mrs. d'Urberville, a rich widow in a rural mansion near the town of Trantridge and \"claim kin\". She is unaware that in fact Mrs. d'Urberville's husband Simon Stoke adopted the surname and was unrelated to the real d'Urbervilles. Tess fails to meet Mrs. d'Urberville, but chances on her libertine son, Alec, who takes a fancy to Tess and finds her a job as a poultry keeper on the estate. Although Tess tells her parents that she fears he may try to seduce her, they encourage her to take the job, secretly hoping Alec may marry her. Tess dislikes Alec, but endures his persistent unwanted attentions while earning enough to replace her family's horse. Despite his often cruel and manipulative behaviour, the threat from Alec to Tess's virtue is sometimes obscured for Tess by her inexperience and almost daily, commonplace interactions with him. Late one night, walking home from town with some other Trantridge villagers, Tess inadvertently antagonizes Car Darch, Alec's most recently discarded favourite and finds herself in physical danger. When Alec rides up and offers to \"rescue\" her from the situation, she accepts. Instead of taking her home, however, he rides through the fog until they reach an ancient grove in a forest called \"The Chase\", where he informs her that he is lost and leaves on foot to get his bearings. Alec returns to find Tess asleep, and it is implied that he rapes her. Mary Jacobus, a commentator on Hardy's works, speculates that the ambiguity may have been forced on the author to meet publisher requirements and the \"Grundyist\" readership of his time."

His brothers Felix and Cuthbert, both ordained Church of England clergy, note Angel's coarsened manners, while Angel considers them staid and narrow-minded. The Clares have long hoped that Angel will marry Mercy Chant, a pious schoolmistress, but Angel argues that a wife who knows farm life would be a more practical choice. He tells his parents about Tess and they agree to meet her. His father, Rev. James Clare, tells Angel of his efforts to convert the local populace, mentioning his failure to tame a young miscreant named Alec d'Urberville. Angel returns to Talbothays Dairy and asks Tess to marry him. This puts Tess in a painful dilemma: Angel thinks her a virgin and she shrinks from revealing her past, but such is her love for him that she finally agrees to the marriage, pretending she had only hesitated because she had heard he hated old families and thought he would not approve of her d'Urberville ancestry. In fact he is pleased by the news, as he thinks it will make their match seem more suitable to his family. As the marriage approaches, Tess grows increasingly troubled. She writes to her mother for advice; Joan tells her to keep silent about her past. Her anxiety increases when a man from Trantridge named Groby recognises her and crudely alludes to her history. Angel overhears and flies into an uncharacteristic rage. Tess, deciding to tell Angel the truth, writes a letter describing her dealings with d'Urberville and slips it under his door. When Angel greets her with the usual affection the next morning, she thinks he has forgiven her; later she discovers the letter under his carpet and realises that he has not seen it. She destroys it. The wedding ceremony goes smoothly, apart from the bad omen of a cock crowing in the afternoon. Tess and Angel spend their wedding night at an old d'Urberville family mansion, where Angel presents his bride with diamonds that belonged to his godmother. When he confesses that he once had a brief affair with an older woman in London, Tess finally feels able to tell Angel about Alec, thinking he will understand and forgive."

He concedes that Tess was \"more sinned against\" than sinning, but feels that her \"want of firmness\" against Alec may point to a flaw in her character and that she is no longer the woman he thought she was. He spends the wedding night on a sofa. After a few awkward days, a devastated Tess suggests they separate, saying that she will return to her parents. Angel gives her some money and promises to try to reconcile himself to her past, but warns her not to try to join him until he sends for her. After a brief visit to his parents, Angel takes a ship to Brazil to see if he can start a new life there. Before he leaves, he encounters Tess's milkmaid friend Izz and impulsively asks her to come with him as his mistress. She accepts, but when he asks her how much she loves him, she admits, \"Nobody could love 'ee more than Tess did! She would have laid down her life for 'ee. I could do no more!\" Hearing this, he abandons the whim and Izz goes home weeping bitterly. Tess returns home for a time, but soon runs out of money, having to help out her parents more than once. Finding her life with them unbearable, she decides to join Marian at a starve-acre farm called Flintcomb-Ash; they are later joined by Izz. On the road, she is again recognised and insulted by Groby, who later turns out to be her new employer. At the farm, the three former milkmaids perform hard physical labour. One winter day, Tess attempts to visit Angel's family at the parsonage in Emminster, hoping for practical assistance. As she nears her destination, she encounters Angel's older brothers, with Mercy Chant. They do not recognise her, but she overhears them discussing Angel's unwise marriage and dares not approach them. On the way home, she overhears a wandering preacher and is shocked to find he is Alec d'Urberville, who has been converted to Methodism through the Rev. James Clare."

Alec claims she has put a spell on him and makes Tess swear never to tempt him again as they stand beside an ill-omened stone monument called the Cross-in-Hand. However, Alec continues to pursue her and soon comes to Flintcomb-Ash to ask Tess to marry him, although she tells him she is already married. He begins stalking her, despite repeated rebuffs, returning at Candlemas and again in early spring, when Tess is hard at work feeding a threshing machine. He tells her he is no longer a preacher and wants her to be with him. When he insults Angel, she slaps him, drawing blood. Tess then learns from her sister, Liza-Lu, that her father, John, is ill and that her mother is dying. Tess rushes home to look after them. Her mother soon recovers, but her father unexpectedly dies of a heart condition. The impoverished family is now evicted from their home, as Durbeyfield held only a life lease on their cottage. Alec, having followed her to her home village, tries to persuade Tess that her husband is never coming back and offers to house the Durbeyfields on his estate. Tess refuses his assistance several times. She has earlier written Angel a psalm-like letter full of love, self-abasement and pleas for mercy, in which she begs him to help her fight the temptation she faces. Now, however, she finally begins to realize that Angel has wronged her and scribbles a hasty note saying she will do all she can to forget him, since he has treated her so unjustly. The Durbeyfields plan to rent rooms in the town of Kingsbere, ancestral home of the d'Urbervilles, but arrive to find they have already been rented to others. All but destitute, they are forced to shelter in the churchyard under the D'Urberville window. Tess enters the church and in the d'Urberville Aisle, Alec reappears and importunes Tess again. The scene ends with her desperately looking at the entrance to the d'Urberville vault and wishing herself dead. In the meantime, Angel has been very ill in Brazil and his farming venture has failed. He heads home to England. On the way he confides his troubles to a stranger, who tells him he was wrong to leave his wife; what she was in the past should matter less than what she might become. Angel begins to repent of his treatment of Tess."

He sets out to find Tess and eventually locates Joan, now well-dressed and living in a pleasant cottage. After responding evasively to his inquiries, she tells him Tess has gone to live in Sandbourne, a fashionable seaside resort. There he finds Tess living in an expensive boarding house under the name \"Mrs. d'Urberville\". When Angel asks for Tess, she appears in startlingly elegant attire and stands aloof. He tenderly asks her forgiveness, but Tess in anguish, tells him he has come too late. Thinking he will never return, she has yielded at last to Alec d'Urberville's persuasion and become his mistress. She gently asks Angel to leave and never return. He departs and Tess goes back to her bedroom, where she falls to her knees and begins to lament. She blames Alec for causing her to lose Angel's love a second time, accusing him of lies in saying that Angel would never return to her. Subsequent events are narrated from the viewpoint of the landlady, Mrs. Brooks. She tries to listen at the keyhole but withdraws hastily when the argument between Tess and Alec becomes heated. She later sees Tess leave the house, then notices a spreading red spot \u2013 a bloodstain \u2013 on the ceiling. She summons help and Alec is found stabbed to death in his bed. Angel, disheartened, is leaving Sandbourne; Tess hurries after and tells him she has killed Alec, saying she hopes she has won his forgiveness by murdering the man who ruined both their lives. Angel does not believe her at first, but grants her his forgiveness and tells her he loves her. Rather than heading for the coast, they walk inland, vaguely planning to hide somewhere until the search for Tess is ended and they can escape abroad from a port. They find an empty mansion and stay there for five days in blissful happiness until a cleaning woman discovers their presence one day. They walk on, and in the middle of the night stumble upon Stonehenge, where Tess lies down to rest on an ancient altar. Before she falls asleep, she asks Angel to look after her younger sister, Liza-Lu, saying she hopes Angel will marry her after she is dead. At dawn, Angel sees they are surrounded by police. He finally realises that Tess really has committed murder and asks the men in a whisper to let her awaken naturally before they arrest her. When she opens her eyes and sees the police, she tells Angel she is \"almost glad\", because \"now I shall not live for you to despise me.\" Her parting words are, \"I am ready.\" Tess is escorted to Wintoncester (Winchester) prison. The novel closes with Angel and Liza-Lu watching from a nearby hill as the black flag signalling Tess's execution is raised over the prison. Angel and Liza-Lu then join hands and go on their way."

        "title": "Tess of the d'Urbervilles_Symbolism and themes",
        "content": "Hardy's writing often explores what he called the \"ache of modernism\", a theme notable in Tess, which as one critic noted, In depicting this Hardy draws on imagery associated with hell to describe modern farm machinery, and suggests the effete nature of city life, as milk sent there must be watered down before townspeople can stomach it. Angel's middle-class fastidiousness makes him reject Tess, a woman whom Hardy presents as a sort of Wessex Eve, in harmony with the natural world. When he parts from her and goes to Brazil, the handsome young man gets so ill that he becomes a \"mere yellow skeleton\". All these signs have been interpreted as negative results of humanity's separation from nature, in creating destructive machinery and in failing to rejoice in pure and unadulterated nature. On the other hand, the Marxist critic Raymond Williams in The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence questions the identification of Tess with a peasantry destroyed by industrialization. Williams sees Tess not as a peasant, but as an educated member of the rural working class, who suffers a tragedy through being thwarted in her hopes to rise socially and desire for a good life (which includes love and sex), not by industrialism, but by the landed bourgeoisie (Alec), liberal idealism (Angel) and Christian moralism in her family's village (see Chapter LI). Earlier commentators were not always appreciative. Henry James and Robert Louis Stevenson in Bournemouth \"loved to talk of books and bookmen: Stevenson, unlike James, was an admirer of Thomas Hardy, but agreed that Tess of the D'Urbervilles was 'vile'.\" Another role of Tess's only true friend and advocate, pointedly subtitling the book \"a pure woman faithfully presented\" and prefacing it with Shakespeare's words from The Two Gentlemen of Verona: \"Poor wounded name! My bosom as a bed/Shall lodge thee.\" However, though Hardy clearly means to criticize Victorian notions of female purity, the double standard also makes the heroine's tragedy possible and so serves as a mechanism of Tess's broader fate. Hardy variously hints that Tess must suffer either to atone for the misdeeds of her ancestors, or to provide temporary amusement for the gods, or because she possesses some small but lethal character flaw inherited from her ancestors. Because of the numerous pagan and neo-Biblical references made about her, Tess has been seen variously as an Earth goddess or a sacrificial victim. For example, early in the novel, she takes part in a festival for Ceres, the goddess of the harvest, and when she baptises her dead child she chooses a passage from Genesis, the book of creation, rather than more traditional New Testament verses. Then when Tess and Angel come to Stonehenge, which was commonly believed in Hardy's time to be a pagan temple, she willingly lies on a stone supposedly associated with human sacrifice. Tess has been seen as a personification of nature, an idea supported by her ties with animals throughout the novel. Tess's misfortunes begin when she falls asleep while driving Prince to market and causes the horse's death; at Trantridge she becomes a poultry-keeper; she and Angel fall in love amid cows in the fertile Froom valley; on the road to Flintcomb-Ash, she kills some wounded pheasants to end their suffering. Yet Tess emerges as a powerful character not through this symbolism but because \"Hardy's feelings for her were strong, perhaps stronger than for any of his other invented personages.\" When Hardy was 16, he saw the hanging of Elizabeth Martha Brown, who had murdered a violent husband. This fascinating, yet repellent experience contributed to the writing of Tess. The moral commentary running through the novel insists that Tess is not at fault in imposing mythological, biblical and folk imagery on a story of a young girl seduced and abandoned to create a \"challenging contemporaneity\". It was controversial and polarizing, setting these elements in a context of 19th-century English society, including disputes in the Church, the National School movement, the overall class structure of English society, and changing circumstances of rural labour. During the era of first-wave feminism, civil divorce was introduced and campaigns were waged against child prostitution, moving gender and sexuality issues to the forefront of public discussion. Hardy's work was criticized as vulgar, though by the late 19th century other experimental fiction works were released such as Florence Dixie's depiction of feminist utopia, The Story of an African Farm by Olive Schreiner, and Sarah Grand's work The Heavenly Twins. These raised awareness of syphilis and advocating sensitivity rather than condemnation for young women infected with it."

A copyright performance was given at St James's Theatre in London on the same date. It was revived in America in 1902 and then made into a motion picture by Adolph Zukor in 1913, starring Mrs. Fiske; no copies remain. In the UK, an adaptation, Tess, by H. Mountford, opened at the Grand Theatre in Blackpool on 5 January 1900. Tess, a different stage adaptation by H. A. Kennedy, premi\u00e8red at the Coronet Theatre in London's Notting Hill Gate on 19 February 1900. Mrs Lewis Waller (Florence West) played the title role, with William Kettridge as Angel Clare and Whitworth Jones as Alec Tantridge. The play transferred to the Comedy Theatre for 17 performances from 14 April 1900 with a slightly different cast, including Fred Terry as Alec and Oswald Yorke as Angel. In 1924 Hardy himself wrote a British theatrical adaptation and chose Gertrude Bugler, a Dorchester girl from the original Hardy Players to play Tess.<ref name=\"woodhall\">N. Woodhall (2006), Norrie's Tale: An Autobiography of the Last of the 'Hardy Players, Wareham: Lullworde Publication</ref> The Hardy Players (re-formed in 2005) was an amateur group from Dorchester that re-enacted Hardy's novels. Bugler was acclaimed, but prevented from taking the London stage part by the jealousy of Hardy's wife, Florence; Hardy had said that young Gertrude was the true incarnation of the Tess he had imagined. Years before writing the novel, Hardy had been inspired by the beauty of her mother Augusta Way, then an 18-year-old milkmaid, when he visited Augusta's father's farm in Bockhampton. When Hardy saw Bugler (he rehearsed The Hardy Players at the hotel run by her parents), he immediately recognised her as a young image of the now older Augusta. The novel was successfully adapted for the stage several more times: 1946: An adaptation by playwright Ronald Gow became a triumph on the West End starring Wendy Hiller. 1999: Tess of the d'Urbervilles, a new West End musical with music by Stephen Edwards and lyrics by Justin Fleming opens in London at the Savoy Theatre. 2007: Tess, The New Musical (a rock opera) with lyrics, music and libretto by Annie Pasqua and Jenna Pasqua premi\u00e8res in New York City. 2009: Tess of the d'Urbervilles, a new stage adaptation with five actors was produced in London by Myriad Theatre & Film. 2010: Tess, a new rock opera, is an official Next Link Selection at the New York Musical Theatre Festival with music, lyrics, and libretto by Annie Pasqua and Jenna Pasqua. 2011: Tess of the d'Urbervilles, adapted from the original 1924 script by Devina Symes for Norrie Woodhall, the last surviving member of Hardy\u2019s theatrical group, the Hardy Players. Three extra scenes were included at Woodhall's request, including the final one, staged as Woodhall described it from her own appearance in Hardy's original adaptation: \"Tess, accompanied by Angel Clare, is arrested by a phalanx of constables for the murder of her other suitor Alec d'Urberville at sunrise, after a night spent within the bluestone towers of a lonely henge on the bleak and wind swept expanse of Salisbury Plain.\" 2012: Tess of the d'Urbervilles was produced into a piece of musical theatre by Youth Music Theatre UK as part of their summer season, and further developed, edited and performed in 2017 at the Theatre Royal, Winchester, and The Other Palace, London in 2018. 2019: Tess - The Musical, a new British musical by composer Michael Blore and playwright Michael Davies, received a workshop production at The Other Place, the Royal Shakespeare Company's studio theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, in February 2019."

        "content": "OK Computer is the third studio album by English rock band Radiohead, released on 21 May 1997 on EMI subsidiaries Parlophone and Capitol Records. Radiohead self-produced the album with Nigel Godrich, an arrangement they have used for their subsequent albums. Other than the song \"Lucky\", recorded in 1995, Radiohead recorded OK Computer in Oxfordshire and Bath in 1996 and early 1997, mostly in the historic mansion St Catherine's Court. The band distanced themselves from the guitar-centred, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computers abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and eclectic influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work. The album's lyrics depict a world fraught with rampant consumerism, social alienation, emotional isolation and political malaise; in this capacity, OK Computer has been said to have prescient insight into the mood of 21st-century life. The band used unconventional production techniques, including natural reverberation through recording on a staircase, and no audio separation. Strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. Guitarist Ed O'Brien estimated that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live. Despite lowered sales estimates by EMI, who deemed the record uncommercial and difficult to market, OK Computer reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and debuted at number 21 on the Billboard 200, Radiohead's highest album entry on the US charts at the time, and was soon certified 5\u00d7 platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. The songs \"Paranoid Android\", \"Karma Police\", \"Lucky\" and \"No Surprises\" were released as singles. The album expanded Radiohead's international popularity and has sold at least 7.8 million units worldwide. A remastered version with additional tracks, OKNOTOK 1997 2017, was released in 2017, marking the album's twentieth anniversary. In 2019, in response to an internet leak, Radiohead released MiniDiscs [Hacked], comprising hours of demos, rehearsals, live performances and other material. OK Computer received critical acclaim and has been cited by listeners, critics and musicians as one of the greatest albums of all time. It was nominated for the Album of the Year and won Best Alternative Music Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards. It was also nominated for Best British Album at the 1998 Brit Awards. The album initiated a stylistic shift in British rock away from Britpop toward melancholic, atmospheric alternative rock that became more prevalent in the next decade. In 2014, it was included by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."

        "content": "In 1995, Radiohead toured in support of their second album, The Bends (1995). Midway through the tour, Brian Eno commissioned them to contribute a song to The Help Album, a charity compilation organised by War Child; the album was to be recorded over the course of a single day, 4 September 1995, and rush-released that week. Radiohead recorded \"Lucky\" in five hours with engineer Nigel Godrich, who had engineered on The Bends and produced several Radiohead B-sides. Godrich said of the session: \"Those things are the most inspiring, when you do stuff really fast and there's nothing to lose. We left feeling fairly euphoric. So after establishing a bit of a rapport work-wise, I was sort of hoping I would be involved with the next album.\" Singer Thom Yorke said \"Lucky\" shaped the nascent sound and mood of their upcoming record: \"'Lucky' was indicative of what we wanted to do. It was like the first mark on the wall.\" Radiohead found touring stressful and took a break in January 1996. They sought to distance their new material from the introspective style of The Bends. Drummer Philip Selway said: \"There was an awful lot of soul-searching [on The Bends]. To do that again on another album would be excruciatingly boring.\" Yorke said he did not want to do \"another miserable, morbid and negative record\", and was \"writing down all the positive things that I hear or see. I'm not able to put them into music yet and I don't want to just force it.\" The critical and commercial success of The Bends gave Radiohead the confidence to self-produce their third album. Their label Parlophone gave them a \u00a3100,000 budget for recording equipment. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said \"the only concept that we had for this album was that we wanted to record it away from the city and that we wanted to record it ourselves\". According to guitarist Ed O'Brien, \"Everyone said, 'You'll sell six or seven million if you bring out The Bends Pt 2,' and we're like, 'We'll kick against that and do the opposite'.\" A number of producers, including major figures such as R.E.M. producer Scott Litt, were suggested, but the band were encouraged by their sessions with Godrich. They consulted him for advice on what equipment to use, and prepared for the sessions by buying their own equipment, including a plate reverberator purchased from songwriter Jona Lewie. Although Godrich had sought to focus his work on electronic dance music, he outgrew his role as advisor and became the album's co-producer."

        "content": "In early 1996, Radiohead recorded demos for their third album at Chipping Norton Recording Studios, Oxford. In July, they began rehearsing and recording in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near Didcot, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline that contributed to the stress of The Bends, the band had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: \"We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song\u00a0... The stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them.\" The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly \"the loudest voice\", according to O'Brien. Selway said \"we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, but at the same time we are all very critical about what the other person is doing.\" Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead \"need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well\u00a0... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility\u2014the term producing a record means taking responsibility for the record\u00a0... It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across.\" Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's \"sixth member\", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the \"fifth Beatle\". Radiohead decided that Canned Applause was an unsatisfactory recording location, which Yorke attributed to its proximity to the band members' homes, and Jonny Greenwood attributed to its lack of dining and bathroom facilities. The group had nearly completed four songs: \"Electioneering\", \"No Surprises\", \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" and \"The Tourist\". They took a break from recording to embark on an American tour in 1996, opening for Alanis Morissette, performing early versions of several new songs. During the tour, filmmaker Baz Luhrmann commissioned Radiohead to write a song for his upcoming film Romeo + Juliet and gave them the final 30 minutes of the film. Yorke said: \"When we saw the scene in which Claire Danes holds the Colt .45 against her head, we started working on the song immediately.\" Soon afterwards, the band wrote and recorded \"Exit Music (For a Film)\"; the track plays over the film's end credits but was excluded from the soundtrack album at the band's request. The song helped shape the direction of the rest of the album; Yorke said it \"was the first performance we'd ever recorded where every note of it made my head spin\u2014something I was proud of, something I could turn up really, really loud and not wince at any moment.\" Radiohead resumed recording in September 1996 at St Catherine's Court, a historic mansion near Bath owned by actress Jane Seymour. The mansion was unoccupied but sometimes used for corporate functions. The change of setting marked an important transition in the recording process. Greenwood, comparing the mansion to previous studio settings, said it \"was less like a laboratory experiment, which is what being in a studio is usually like, and more about a group of people making their first record together.\" The band made extensive use of the different rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on \"Exit Music (For a Film)\" feature natural reverberation achieved by recording on a stone staircase, and \"Let Down\" was recorded in a ballroom at 3 a.m. Isolation allowed the band to work at a different pace, with more flexible and spontaneous working hours. O'Brien said that \"the biggest pressure was actually completing [the recording]. We weren't given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted. We were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff.\" Yorke was satisfied with the recordings made at the location, and enjoyed working without audio separation, meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately. O'Brien estimated that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: \"I hate doing overdubs, because it just doesn't feel natural.\u00a0... Something special happens when you're playing live; a lot of it is just looking at one another and knowing there are four other people making it happen.\" Many of Yorke's vocals were first takes; he felt that if he made other attempts he would \"start to think about it and it would sound really lame\". Radiohead returned to Canned Applause in October for rehearsals, and completed most of OK Computer in further sessions at St. Catherine's Court. By Christmas, they had narrowed the track listing to 14 songs. The strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London in January 1997. The album was mixed over the next two months at various London studios, then mastered by Chris Blair at Abbey Road. Godrich preferred a quick and \"hands-off\" approach to mixing, and said: \"I feel like I get too into it. I start fiddling with things and I fuck it up\u00a0... I generally take about half a day to do a mix. If it's any longer than that, you lose it. The hardest thing is trying to stay fresh, to stay objective.\""

        "content": "Yorke said that the starting point for the record was the \"incredibly dense and terrifying sound\" of Bitches Brew, the 1970 avant-garde jazz fusion album by Miles Davis. He described the sound of Bitches Brew to Q: \"It was building something up and watching it fall apart, that's the beauty of it. It was at the core of what we were trying to do with OK Computer.\" Yorke identified \"I'll Wear It Proudly\" by Elvis Costello, \"Fall on Me\" by R.E.M., \"Dress\" by PJ Harvey and \"A Day in the Life\" by the Beatles as particularly influential on his songwriting. Radiohead drew further inspiration from the recording style of film soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone and the krautrock band Can, musicians Yorke described as \"abusing the recording process\". Jonny Greenwood described OK Computer as a product of being \"in love with all these brilliant records ... trying to recreate them, and missing\". According to Yorke, Radiohead hoped to achieve an \"atmosphere that's perhaps a bit shocking when you first hear it, but only as shocking as the atmosphere on the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds\". They expanded their instrumentation to include electric piano, Mellotron, cello and other strings, glockenspiel and electronic effects. Jonny Greenwood summarised the exploratory approach as \"when we've got what we suspect to be an amazing song, but nobody knows what they're gonna play on it.\" Spin characterised OK Computer as sounding like \"a DIY electronica album made with guitars\". Critics suggested a stylistic debt to 1970s progressive rock, an influence that Radiohead have disavowed. According to Andy Greene in Rolling Stone, Radiohead \"were collectively hostile to seventies progressive rock ... but that didn't stop them from reinventing prog from scratch on OK Computer, particularly on the six-and-a-half-minute 'Paranoid Android'.\" Tom Hull believed the album was \"still prog, but may just be because rock has so thoroughly enveloped musical storytelling that this sort of thing has become inevitable.\" Writing in 2017, The New Yorkers Kelefa Sanneh said OK Computer \"was profoundly prog: grand and dystopian, with a lead single that was more than six minutes long\"."

        "title": "OK Computer_Lyrics",
        "content": "The album's lyrics, written by Yorke, are more abstract compared to his personal, emotional lyrics for The Bends. Critic Alex Ross said the lyrics \"seemed a mixture of overheard conversations, techno-speak, and fragments of a harsh diary\" with \"images of riot police at political rallies, anguished lives in tidy suburbs, yuppies freaking out, sympathetic aliens gliding overhead.\" Recurring themes include transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism. Yorke said: \"On this album, the outside world became all there was\u00a0... I'm just taking Polaroids of things around me moving too fast.\" He told Q: \"It was like there's a secret camera in a room and it's watching the character who walks in\u2014a different character for each song. The camera's not quite me. It's neutral, emotionless. But not emotionless at all. In fact, the very opposite.\" Yorke also drew inspiration from books, including Noam Chomsky's political writing, Eric Hobsbawm's The Age of Extremes, Will Hutton's The State We're In, Jonathan Coe's What a Carve Up! and Philip K. Dick's VALIS. The songs of OK Computer do not have a coherent narrative, and the album's lyrics are generally considered abstract or oblique. Nonetheless, many musical critics, journalists, and scholars consider the album to be a concept album or song cycle, or have analysed it as a concept album, noting its strong thematic cohesion, aesthetic unity, and the structural logic of the song sequencing. Although the songs share common themes, Radiohead have said they do not consider OK Computer a concept album and did not intend to link the songs through a narrative or unifying concept while it was being written. Jonny Greenwood said: \"I think one album title and one computer voice do not make a concept album. That's a bit of a red herring.\" However, the band intended the album to be heard as a whole, and spent two weeks ordering the track list. O'Brien said: \"The context of each song is really important\u00a0... It's not a concept album but there is a continuity there.\""

        "content": "The opening track, \"Airbag\", is underpinned by a beat built from a seconds-long recording of Selway's drumming. The band sampled the drum track with a sampler and edited it with a Macintosh computer, inspired by the music of DJ Shadow, but admitted to making approximations in emulating Shadow's style due to their programming inexperience. The bassline stops and starts unexpectedly, achieving an effect similar to 1970s dub. The song's references to automobile accidents and reincarnation were inspired by a magazine article titled \"An Airbag Saved My Life\" and The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Yorke wrote \"Airbag\" about the illusion of safety offered by modern transit, and \"the idea that whenever you go out on the road you could be killed\". The BBC wrote of the influence of J. G. Ballard, especially his 1973 novel Crash, on the lyrics. Music journalist Tim Footman noted that the song's technical innovations and lyrical concerns demonstrated the \"key paradox\" of the album: \"The musicians and producer are delighting in the sonic possibilities of modern technology; the singer, meanwhile, is railing against its social, moral, and psychological impact ... It's a contradiction mirrored in the culture clash of the music, with the 'real' guitars negotiating an uneasy stand-off with the hacked-up, processed drums.\" Split into four sections with an overall running time of 6:23, \"Paranoid Android\" is among the band's longest songs. The unconventional structure was inspired by the Beatles' \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\" and Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which also eschew a traditional verse-chorus-verse structure. Its musical style was also inspired by the music of the Pixies. The song was written by Yorke after an unpleasant night at a Los Angeles bar, where he saw a woman react violently after someone spilled a drink on her. Its title and lyrics are a reference to Marvin the Paranoid Android from Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. The use of electric keyboards in \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" is an example of the band's attempts to emulate the atmosphere of Bitches Brew. Its title references the Bob Dylan song \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", and the lyrics describe an isolated narrator who fantasises about being abducted by extraterrestrials. The narrator speculates that, upon returning to Earth, his friends would not believe his story and he would remain a misfit. The lyrics were inspired by an assignment from Yorke's time at Abingdon School to write a piece of \"Martian poetry\", a British literary movement that humorously recontextualises mundane aspects of human life from an alien perspective. William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet inspired the lyrics for \"Exit Music (For a Film)\". Initially Yorke wanted to work lines from the play into the song, but the final draft of the lyrics became a broad summary of the narrative. He said: \"I saw the Zeffirelli version when I was 13 and I cried my eyes out, because I couldn't understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn't just run away. It's a song for two people who should run away before all the bad stuff starts.\" Yorke compared the opening of the song, which mostly features his singing paired with acoustic guitar, to Johnny Cash's At Folsom Prison. Mellotron choir and other electronic voices are used throughout the track. The song climaxes with the entrance of drums and distorted bass run through a fuzz pedal. The climactic portion of the song is an attempt to emulate the sound of trip hop group Portishead, but in a style that bass player Colin Greenwood called more \"stilted and leaden and mechanical\". The song concludes by fading back to Yorke's voice, acoustic guitar and Mellotron. \"Let Down\" contains multilayered arpeggiated guitars and electric piano. Jonny Greenwood plays his guitar part in a different time signature to the other instruments. O'Brien said the song was influenced by Phil Spector, a producer and songwriter best known for his reverberating \"Wall of Sound\" recording techniques. The lyrics, Yorke said, are about a fear of being trapped, and \"about that feeling that you get when you're in transit but you're not in control of it\u2014you just go past thousands of places and thousands of people and you're completely removed from it\". Of the line \"Don't get sentimental / It always ends up drivel\", Yorke said: \"Sentimentality is being emotional for the sake of it. We're bombarded with sentiment, people emoting. That's the Let Down. Feeling every emotion is fake. Or rather every emotion is on the same plane whether it's a car advert or a pop song.\" Yorke felt that scepticism of emotion was characteristic of Generation X and that it had informed the band's approach to the album. \"Karma Police\" has two main verses that alternate with a subdued break, followed by a different ending section. The verses centre around acoustic guitar and piano, with a chord progression indebted to the Beatles' \"Sexy Sadie\". Starting at 2:34, the song transitions into an orchestrated section with the repeated line \"For a minute there, I lost myself\". It ends with guitarist Ed O'Brien generating feedback using a delay effect. The title and lyrics to \"Karma Police\" originate from an in-joke during The Bends tour; Jonny Greenwood said \"whenever someone was behaving in a particularly shitty way, we'd say 'The karma police will catch up with him sooner or later.'\""

        "content": "\"Fitter Happier\" is a short musique concr\u00e8te track that consists of sampled musical and background sound and spoken-word lyrics recited by \"Fred\", a synthesised voice from the Macintosh SimpleText application. Yorke wrote the lyrics \"in ten minutes\" after a period of writer's block while the rest of the band were playing. He described the words as a checklist of slogans for the 1990s, and he considered the lyrics \"the most upsetting thing I've ever written\", and said it was \"liberating\" to give the words to a neutral-sounding computer voice. Among the samples in the background is an audio loop from the 1975 film Three Days of the Condor. The band considered using \"Fitter Happier\" as the album's opening track, but decided the effect was off-putting. Steve Lowe called the song \"penetrating surgery on pseudo-meaningful corporations' lifestyles\" with \"a repugnance for prevailing yuppified social values\". Among the loosely connected imagery of the lyrics, Footman identified the song's subject as \"the materially comfortable, morally empty embodiment of modern, Western humanity, half-salaryman, half-Stepford Wife, destined for the metaphorical farrowing crate, propped up on Prozac, Viagra and anything else his insurance plan can cover.\" Sam Steele called the lyrics \"a stream of received imagery: scraps of media information, interspersed with lifestyle ad slogans and private prayers for a healthier existence. It is the hum of a world buzzing with words, one of the messages seeming to be that we live in such a synthetic universe we have grown unable to detect reality from artifice.\" \"Electioneering\", featuring a cowbell and a distorted guitar solo, is the album's most rock-oriented track and one of the heaviest songs Radiohead has recorded. It has been compared to Radiohead's earlier style on Pablo Honey. The cynical \"Electioneering\" is the album's most directly political song, with lyrics inspired by the Poll Tax Riots. The song was also inspired by Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent, a book analysing contemporary mass media under the propaganda model. Yorke likened its lyrics, which focus on political and artistic compromise, to \"a preacher ranting in front of a bank of microphones\". Regarding its oblique political references, Yorke said, \"What can you say about the IMF, or politicians? Or people selling arms to African countries, employing slave labour or whatever. What can you say? You just write down 'Cattle prods and the IMF' and people who know, know.\" O'Brien said the song was about the promotional cycle of touring: \"After a while you feel like a politician who has to kiss babies and shake hands all day long.\" \"Climbing Up the Walls\" \u2013 described by Melody Maker as \"monumental chaos\" \u2013 is layered with a string section, ambient noise and repetitive, metallic percussion. The string section, composed by Jonny Greenwood and written for 16 instruments, was inspired by modern classical composer Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima. Greenwood said, \"I got very excited at the prospect of doing string parts that didn't sound like 'Eleanor Rigby', which is what all string parts have sounded like for the past 30 years.\" Select described Yorke's distraught vocals and the atonal strings as \"Thom's voice dissolving into a fearful, blood-clotted scream as Jonny whips the sound of a million dying elephants into a crescendo\". For the lyrics, Yorke drew from his time as an orderly in a mental hospital during the Care in the Community policy of deinstitutionalising mental health patients, and a New York Times article about serial killers. He said: \"No Surprises\", recorded in a single take, is arranged with electric guitar (inspired by the Beach Boys' \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\"), acoustic guitar, glockenspiel and vocal harmonies. The band strove to replicate the mood of Louis Armstrong's 1968 recording of \"What a Wonderful World\" and the soul music of Marvin Gaye. Yorke identified the subject of the song as \"someone who's trying hard to keep it together but can't\". The lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life, and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order. Some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery. One of the key metaphors in the song is the opening line, \"a heart that's full up like a landfill\"; according to Yorke, the song is a \"fucked-up nursery rhyme\" that \"stems from my unhealthy obsession of what to do with plastic boxes and plastic bottles\u00a0... All this stuff is getting buried, the debris of our lives. It doesn't rot, it just stays there. That's how we deal, that's how I deal with stuff, I bury it.\" The song's gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics; Steele said, \"even when the subject is suicide\u00a0... O'Brien's guitar is as soothing as balm on a red-raw psyche, the song rendered like a bittersweet child's prayer.\" \"Lucky\" was inspired by the Bosnian War. Sam Taylor said it was \"the one track on [The Help Album] to capture the sombre terror of the conflict\", and that its serious subject matter and dark tone made the band \"too 'real' to be allowed on the Britpop gravy train\". The lyrics were pared down from many pages of notes, and were originally more politically explicit. The lyrics depict a man surviving an aeroplane crash and are drawn from Yorke's anxiety about transportation. The musical centerpiece of \"Lucky\" is its three-piece guitar arrangement, which grew out of the high-pitched chiming sound played by O'Brien in the song's introduction, achieved by strumming above the guitar nut. Critics have compared its lead guitar to Pink Floyd and, more broadly, arena rock. The album ends with \"The Tourist\", which Jonny Greenwood wrote as an unusually staid piece where something \"doesn't have to happen\u00a0... every three seconds\". He said, \"'The Tourist' doesn't sound like Radiohead at all. It has become a song with space.\" The lyrics, written by Yorke, were inspired by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible. He said it was chosen as the closing track because \"a lot of the album was about background noise and everything moving too fast and not being able to keep up. It was really obvious to have 'Tourist' as the last song. That song was written to me from me, saying, 'Idiot, slow down.' Because at that point, I needed to. So that was the only resolution there could be: to slow down.\" The \"unexpectedly bluesy waltz\" draws to a close as the guitars drop out, leaving only drums and bass, and concludes with the sound of a small bell."

The title stuck with the band; according to Jonny Greenwood, it \"started attaching itself and creating all these weird resonances with what we were trying to do\". Yorke said the title \"refers to embracing the future, it refers to being terrified of the future, of our future, of everyone else's. It's to do with standing in a room where all these appliances are going off and all these machines and computers and so on\u00a0... and the sound it makes.\" He described the title as \"a really resigned, terrified phrase\", to him similar to the Coca-Cola advertisement \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\". Wired writer Leander Kahney suggests that it is an homage to Macintosh computers, as the Mac's speech recognition software responds to the command \"OK computer\" as an alternative to clicking the \"OK\" button.

        "content": "The OK Computer artwork is a computer-generated collage of images and text created by Yorke, credited under the pseudonym the White Chocolate Farm, and Stanley Donwood. Yorke commissioned Donwood to work on a visual diary alongside the recording sessions. Yorke explained, \"If I'm shown some kind of visual representation of the music, only then do I feel confident. Up until that point, I'm a bit of a whirlwind.\" The blue-and-white palette was, according to Donwood, the result of \"trying to make something the colour of bleached bone\". The image of two stick figures shaking hands appears in the liner notes and on the disc label in CD and LP releases. Yorke explained the image as emblematic of exploitation: \"Someone's being sold something they don't really want, and someone's being friendly because they're trying to sell something. That's what it means to me.\" The image would later be used as the artwork for Radiohead's first compilation album, Radiohead: The Best Of. Explaining the artwork's themes, Yorke said, \"It's quite sad, and quite funny as well. All the artwork and so on\u00a0... It was all the things that I hadn't said in the songs.\" Visual motifs in the artwork include motorways, aeroplanes, families with children, corporate logos and cityscapes. The photograph of a motorway on the cover was likely taken in Hartford, Connecticut, where Radiohead performed in 1996. The words \"Lost Child\" feature prominently on the cover, and the booklet artwork contains phrases in the constructed language Esperanto and health-related instructions in both English and Greek. Uncut critic David Cavanagh said the use of non-sequiturs created an effect \"akin to being lifestyle-coached by a lunatic\". White scribbles, Donwood's method of correcting mistakes rather than using the computer function undo, are present everywhere in the collages. The liner notes contain the full lyrics, rendered with atypical syntax, alternate spelling and small annotations. The lyrics are also arranged and spaced in shapes that resemble hidden images. In keeping with the band's then-emerging anti-corporate stance, the production credits contain the ironic copyright notice \"Lyrics reproduced by kind permission even though we wrote them.\""

I don't really know why it's so important now, but I'm excited about it.\" Capitol lowered its sales forecast from two million to half a million. In O'Brien's view, only Parlophone, the band's British label, remained optimistic while global distributors dramatically reduced their sales estimates. Label representatives were reportedly disappointed with the lack of marketable singles, especially the absence of anything resembling Radiohead's hit \"Creep\". \"OK Computer isn't the album we're going to rule the world with\", Colin Greenwood predicted at the time. \"It's not as hitting-everything-loudly-whilst-waggling-the-tongue-in-and-out, like The Bends. There's less of the Van Halen factor.\""

        "content": "Parlophone launched an unorthodox advertising campaign, taking full-page advertisements in high-profile British newspapers and tube stations with lyrics for \"Fitter Happier\" in large black letters against white backgrounds. The same lyrics, and artwork adapted from the album, were repurposed for shirt designs. Yorke said they chose the \"Fitter Happier\" lyrics to link what a critic called \"a coherent set of concerns\" between the album artwork and its promotional material. Other unconventional merchandise included a floppy disk containing Radiohead screensavers and an FM radio in the shape of a desktop computer. In America, Capitol sent 1,000 cassette players to prominent members of the press and music industry, each with a copy of the album permanently glued inside. Capitol president Gary Gersh said, \"Our job is just to take them as a left-of-centre band and bring the centre to them. That's our focus, and we won't let up until they're the biggest band in the world.\" Radiohead planned to produce a video for every song on the album, but the project was abandoned due to financial and time constraints. According to \"No Surprises\" video director Grant Gee, the plan was scrapped when the videos for \"Paranoid Android\" and \"Karma Police\" went over budget. Also scrapped were plans for trip hop group Massive Attack to remix the album. Radiohead's website was created to promote the album, which went live at the time of its release, making the band the first to manage an online presence. Their first fansite, \"atease\", was made shortly following the album's release, with its title taken from \"Fitter Happier\". In 2017, during OK Computers 20th anniversary, Radiohead's website was temporarily restored to its 1997 state."

Colin Greenwood said the song was \"hardly the radio-friendly, breakthrough, buzz bin unit shifter [radio stations] can have been expecting\", but that Capitol supported the choice. The song premiered on the Radio 1 programme The Evening Session in April 1997 and was released as a single in May 1997. On the strength of frequent radio play on Radio 1 and rotation of the song's music video on MTV, \"Paranoid Android\" reached number three in the UK, giving Radiohead their highest chart position. \"Karma Police\" was released in August 1997 and \"No Surprises\" in January 1998. Both singles charted in the UK top ten, and \"Karma Police\" peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. \"Lucky\" was released as a single in France, but did not chart. \"Let Down\", considered for release as the lead single, was issued as a promotional single in September 1997 and charted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart at number 29.

Then six months after that, nobody was talking any more.\" The tour included Radiohead's first headline Glastonbury Festival performance on 28 June 1997; despite technical problems that almost caused Yorke to abandon the stage, the performance was acclaimed and cemented Radiohead as a major live act. Rolling Stone described it as \"an absolute triumph\", and in 2004 Q called it the greatest concert of all time."

        "content": "OK Computer was almost uniformly praised on release. Critics described it as a landmark release of far-reaching impact and importance, but noted that its experimentalism made it a challenging listen. According to Tim Footman, \"Not since 1967, with the release of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, had so many major critics agreed immediately, not only on an album's merits, but on its long-term significance, and its ability to encapsulate a particular point in history.\" In the British press, the album garnered favourable reviews in NME, Melody Maker, The Guardian and Q. Nick Kent wrote in Mojo that \"Others may end up selling more, but in 20 years' time I'm betting OK Computer will be seen as the key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and song-structures from an earlier era.\" John Harris wrote in Select: \"Every word sounds achingly sincere, every note spewed from the heart, and yet it roots itself firmly in a world of steel, glass, random-access memory and prickly-skinned paranoia.\" The album was well received by critics in North America. Rolling Stone, Spin, the Los Angeles Times, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pitchfork and the Daily Herald published positive reviews. In The New Yorker, Alex Ross praised its progressiveness, and contrasted Radiohead's risk-taking with the musically conservative \"dadrock\" of their contemporaries Oasis. Ross wrote: \"Throughout the album, contrasts of mood and style are extreme\u00a0... This band has pulled off one of the great art-pop balancing acts in the history of rock.\" Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork lauded the record's emotional appeal, writing that it \"is brimming with genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once passive and fire-breathing\". Reviews for Entertainment Weekly, the Chicago Tribune, and Time were mixed. Robert Christgau from The Village Voice said Radiohead immersed Yorke's vocals in \"enough electronic marginal distinction to feed a coal town for a month\" to compensate for the \"soulless\" songs, resulting in \"arid\" art rock. In an otherwise positive review, Andy Gill wrote for The Independent: \"For all its ambition and determination to break new ground, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive as The Bends, which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that luxuriates so readily in its own despondency.\""

It was also nominated for Best British Album at the 1998 Brit Awards. The album was shortlisted for the 1997 Mercury Prize, a prestigious award recognising the best British or Irish album of the year. The day before the winner was announced, oddsmakers had given OK Computer the best chance to win among ten nominees, but it lost to New Forms by Roni Size/Reprazent. The album appeared in many 1997 critics' lists and listener polls for best album of the year. It topped the year-end polls of Mojo, Vox, Entertainment Weekly, Hot Press, Muziekkrant OOR, HUMO, Eye Weekly and Inpress, and tied for first place with Daft Punk's Homework in The Face. The album came second in NME, Melody Maker, Rolling Stone, Village Voice, Spin and Uncut. Q and Les Inrockuptibles both listed the album in their unranked year-end polls. Praise for the album overwhelmed the band; Greenwood felt the praise had been exaggerated because The Bends had been \"under-reviewed possibly and under-received.\" They rejected links to progressive rock and art rock, despite frequent comparisons made to Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon. Yorke responded: \"We write pop songs\u00a0... there was no intention of it being 'art'. It's a reflection of all the disparate things we were listening to when we recorded it.\" He was nevertheless pleased that listeners identified the album's influences: \"What really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create.\""

        "content": "OK Computer has appeared frequently in professional lists of the greatest albums of all time. A number of publications, including NME, Melody Maker, Alternative Press, Spin, Pitchfork, Time, Metro Weekly and Slant Magazine placed OK Computer prominently in lists of best albums of the 1990s or of all time. It was voted number 4 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). Rolling Stone ranked it 42 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2020. It was previously ranked at 162 in 2003 and 2012. Retrospective reviews from BBC Music, The A.V. Club and Slant received the album favourably. Rolling Stone gave the album five stars in the 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, with critic Rob Sheffield saying, \"Radiohead was claiming the high ground abandoned by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, U2, R.E.M., everybody; and fans around the world loved them for trying too hard at a time when nobody else was even bothering.\" \"Most would rate OK Computer the apogee of pomo texture\", Christgau said in retrospect. According to Acclaimed Music, a site which uses statistics to numerically represent reception among critics, OK Computer is the 8th most celebrated album of all time. In 2014, the United States National Recording Preservation Board selected the album for preservation in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress, which designates it as a sound recording that has had significant cultural, historical or aesthetic impact in American life. The album has been cited by some as undeserving of its acclaim. In a poll surveying thousands conducted by BBC Radio 6 Music, OK Computer was named the sixth most overrated album \"in the world\". David H. Green of The Daily Telegraph called the album \"self-indulgent whingeing\" and maintains that the positive critical consensus towards OK Computer is an indication of \"a 20th-century delusion that rock is the bastion of serious commentary on popular music\" to the detriment of electronic and dance music. The album was selected as an entry in \"Sacred Cows\", an NME column questioning the critical status of \"revered albums\", in which Henry Yates said \"there's no defiance, gallows humour or chink of light beneath the curtain, just a sense of meek, resigned despondency\" and criticised the record as \"the moment when Radiohead stopped being 'good' [compared to The Bends] and started being 'important'\". In a Spin article on the \"myth\" that \"Radiohead Can Do No Wrong\", Chris Norris argues that the acclaim for OK Computer inflated expectations for subsequent Radiohead releases. Christgau felt \"the reason the readers of the British magazine Q absurdly voted OK Computer the greatest album of the 20th century is that it integrated what was briefly called electronica into rock\". Having deemed it \"self-regarding\" and overrated, he later warmed to the record and found it indicative of Radiohead's cerebral sensibility and \"rife with discrete pleasures and surprises\"."

        "content": "OK Computer was recorded in the lead up to the 1997 general election and released a month after the victory of Tony Blair's New Labour government. The album was perceived by critics as an expression of dissent and scepticism toward the new government and a reaction against the national mood of optimism. Dorian Lynskey wrote, \"On May 1, 1997, Labour supporters toasted their landslide victory to the sound of 'Things Can Only Get Better.' A few weeks later, OK Computer appeared like Banquo's ghost to warn: No, things can only get worse.\" According to Amy Britton, the album \"showed not everyone was ready to join the party, instead tapping into another feeling felt throughout the UK\u2014pre-millennial angst.\u00a0... huge corporations were impossible to fight against\u2014this was the world OK Computer soundtracked, not the wave of British optimism.\" In an interview, Yorke doubted that Blair's policies would differ from the preceding two decades of Conservative government. He said the public reaction to the death of Princess Diana was more significant, as a moment when the British public realised \"the royals had had us by the balls for the last hundred years, as had the media and the state.\" The band's distaste with the commercialised promotion of OK Computer reinforced their anti-capitalist politics, which would be further explored on their subsequent releases. Critics have compared Radiohead's statements of political dissatisfaction to those of earlier rock bands. David Stubbs said that, where punk rock had been a rebellion against a time of deficit and poverty, OK Computer protested the \"mechanistic convenience\" of contemporary surplus and excess. Alex Ross said the album \"pictured the onslaught of the Information Age and a young person's panicky embrace of it\" and made the band into \"the poster boys for a certain kind of knowing alienation\u2014as Talking Heads and R.E.M. had been before.\" Jon Pareles of The New York Times found precedents in the work of Pink Floyd and Madness for Radiohead's concerns \"about a culture of numbness, building docile workers and enforced by self-help regimes and anti-depressants.\" The album's tone has been described as millennial or futuristic, anticipating cultural and political trends. According to The A.V. Club writer Steven Hyden in the feature \"Whatever Happened to Alternative Nation\", \"Radiohead appeared to be ahead of the curve, forecasting the paranoia, media-driven insanity, and omnipresent sense of impending doom that's subsequently come to characterise everyday life in the 21st century.\" In 1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, Tom Moon described OK Computer as a \"prescient\u00a0... dystopian essay on the darker implications of technology\u00a0... oozing [with] a vague sense of dread, and a touch of Big Brother foreboding that bears strong resemblance to the constant disquiet of life on Security Level Orange, post-9/11.\" Chris Martin of Coldplay remarked that, \"It would be interesting to see how the world would be different if Dick Cheney really listened to Radiohead's OK Computer. I think the world would probably improve. That album is fucking brilliant. It changed my life, so why wouldn't it change his?\" The album inspired a radio play, also titled OK Computer, which was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2007. The play, written by Joel Horwood, Chris Perkins, Al Smith and Chris Thorpe, interprets the album's 12 tracks into a story about a man who awakens in a Berlin hospital with memory loss and returns to England with doubts that the life he's returned to is his own."

        "content": "The release of OK Computer coincided with the decline of Britpop. Through OK Computers influence, the dominant UK guitar pop shifted toward an approximation of \"Radiohead's paranoid but confessional, slurry but catchy\" approach. Many newer British acts adopted similarly complex, atmospheric arrangements; for example, the post-Britpop band Travis worked with Godrich to create the languid pop texture of The Man Who, which became the fourth best-selling album of 1999 in the UK. Some in the British press accused Travis of appropriating Radiohead's sound. Steven Hyden of AV Club said that by 1999, starting with The Man Who, \"what Radiohead had created in OK Computer had already grown much bigger than the band,\" and that the album went on to influence \"a wave of British-rock balladeers that reached its zenith in the '00s\". OK Computers popularity influenced the next generation of British alternative rock bands, and established musicians in a variety of genres have praised it. Bloc Party and TV on the Radio listened to or were influenced by OK Computer; TV on the Radio's debut album was titled OK Calculator as a lighthearted tribute. Radiohead described the pervasiveness of bands that \"sound like us\" as one reason to break with the style of OK Computer for their next album, Kid A. Although OK Computers influence on rock musicians is widely acknowledged, several critics believe that its experimental inclination was not authentically embraced on a wide scale. Footman said the \"Radiohead Lite\" bands that followed were \"missing [OK Computer] sonic inventiveness, not to mention the lyrical substance.\" David Cavanagh said that most of OK Computers purported mainstream influence more likely stemmed from the ballads on The Bends. According to Cavanagh, \"The populist albums of the post-OK Computer era\u2014the Verve's Urban Hymns, Travis's Good Feeling, Stereophonics' Word Gets Around, Robbie Williams' Life thru a Lens\u2014effectively closed the door that OK Computers boffin-esque inventiveness had opened.\" John Harris believed that OK Computer was one of the \"fleeting signs that British rock music might [have been] returning to its inventive traditions\" in the wake of Britpop's demise. While Harris concludes that British rock ultimately developed an \"altogether more conservative tendency\", he said that with OK Computer and their subsequent material, Radiohead provided a \"clarion call\" to fill the void left by Britpop. OK Computer triggered a minor revival of progressive rock and ambitious concept albums, with a new wave of prog-influenced bands crediting OK Computer for enabling their scene to thrive. Brandon Curtis of Secret Machines said, \"Songs like 'Paranoid Android' made it OK to write music differently, to be more experimental\u00a0... OK Computer was important because it reintroduced unconventional writing and song structures.\" Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree said, \"I don't think ambition is a dirty word any more. Radiohead were the Trojan Horse in that respect. Here's a band that came from the indie rock tradition that snuck in under the radar when the journalists weren't looking and started making these absurdly ambitious and pretentious\u2014and all the better for it\u2014records.\" However, Pitchfork journalist Marc Hogan argued that OK Computer marked an \"ending point\" for the rock-oriented album era, as its dual level of mainstream and critical success went unmatched by any guitar-based album in subsequent decades. In 2005, Q named OK Computer the tenth best progressive rock album."

The first disc contains the original studio album, the second disc contains B-sides collected from OK Computer singles and live recording sessions, and the DVD contains a collection of music videos and a live television performance. All the material on the reissue had been previously released. Press reaction to the reissue expressed concern that EMI was exploiting Radiohead's back catalogue. Larry Fitzmaurice of Spin accused EMI of planning to \"issue and reissue [Radiohead's] discography until the cash stops rolling in\". Pitchforks Ryan Dombal said it was \"hard to look at these reissues as anything other than a cash-grab for EMI/Capitol\u2014an old media company that got dumped by their most forward-thinking band.\" Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone defended the release, saying: \"While it's easy to accuse Capitol of milking the cash cow once again, these sets are pretty comprehensive.\" The reissue was critically well received, although reception was mixed about the supplemental material. Reviews in AllMusic, Uncut, Q, Rolling Stone, Paste and PopMatters praised the supplemental material, but with reservations. A review written by Scott Plagenhoef for Pitchfork awarded the reissue a perfect score, arguing that it was worth buying for fans who did not already own the rare material. Plagenhoef said, \"That the band had nothing to do with these is beside the point: this is the final word on these records, if for no other reason that the Beatles' September 9 remaster campaign is, arguably, the end of the CD era.\" The A.V. Club writer Josh Modell praised the bonus disc and DVD, and said the album was \"the perfect synthesis of Radiohead's seemingly conflicted impulses\". In April 2016, XL Recordings acquired Radiohead's back catalogue. The \"collector's editions\" of Radiohead albums, issued without Radiohead's approval, were removed from streaming services.

The Star was first printed on Toronto World presses, and at its formation, The World owned a 51 percent interest in it as a silent partner. That arrangement only lasted for two months, during which time it was rumoured that William Findlay \"Billy\" Maclean, The Worlds proprietor, was considering selling the Star to the Riordon family. After an extensive fundraising campaign among the Star staff, Maclean agreed to sell his interest to Hocken. The paper did poorly in its first few years. Hocken sold out within the year, and several owners followed in succession until railway entrepreneur William Mackenzie bought it in 1896. Its new editors, Edmund E. Sheppard and Frederic Thomas Nicholls, moved the entire Star operation into the same building used by the magazine Saturday Night. This would continue until Joseph E. \"Holy Joe\" Atkinson, backed by funds raised by supporters of Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, bought the paper.

The Government of Canada Digital Collections website describes Atkinson as: a \"radical\" in the best sense of that term.... The Star was unique among North American newspapers in its consistent, ongoing advocacy of the interests of ordinary people. The friendship of Atkinson, the publisher, with Mackenzie King, the prime minister, was a major influence on the development of Canadian social policy. Atkinson became the controlling shareholder of the Star. The Star was frequently criticized for practising the yellow journalism of its era. For decades, the paper included heavy doses of crime and sensationalism, along with advocating social change. From 1910 to 1973, the Star published a weekend supplement, the Star Weekly. Shortly before his death in 1948, Joseph E. Atkinson transferred ownership of the paper to a charitable organization given the mandate of continuing the paper's liberal tradition. In 1949, the Province of Ontario passed the Charitable Gifts Act, barring charitable organizations from owning large parts of profit-making businesses, that effectively required the Star to be sold. Atkinson's will had directed that profits from the paper's operations were \"for the promotion and maintenance of social, scientific and economic reforms which are charitable in nature, for the benefit of the people of the province of Ontario\" and it stipulated that the paper could be sold only to people who shared his social views. The five trustees of the charitable organization circumvented the Act by buying the paper themselves and swearing before the Supreme Court of Ontario to continue what became known as the \"Atkinson Principles\":"

The station was closed following the establishment of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC) and the introduction of a government policy that, in essence, restricted private stations to an effective radiated power of 100 watts. The Star would continue to supply sponsored content to the CRBC's CRCT station\u2014which later became CBC station CBL\u2014an arrangement that lasted until 1946."

        "content": "In 1971, the newspaper was renamed the Toronto Star and moved to a modern International-Style office tower at One Yonge Street by Queens Quay. The original Star building at 80 King Street West was demolished to make room for First Canadian Place. The new building originally housed the paper's presses. In 1992, the printing plant was moved to the Toronto Star Press Centre at the Highway 407 & 400 interchange in Vaughan. In September 2002, the logo was changed, and \"The\" was dropped from the papers. During the 2003 Northeast blackout, the Star printed the paper at a press in Welland, Ontario. Until the mid-2000s, the front page of the Toronto Star had no third-party advertising aside from upcoming lottery jackpot estimates from the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG). On May 28, 2007, the Star unveiled a redesigned paper that features larger type, narrower pages, fewer and shorter articles, renamed sections, more prominence to local news, and less so to international news, columnists, and opinion pieces. However, on January 1, 2009, the Star reverted to its previous format. Star P.M., a free newspaper in PDF format that could be downloaded from the newspaper's website each weekday afternoon, was discontinued in October 2007, thirteen months after its launch. On January 15, 2016, Torstar confirmed the closure of its Vaughan printing presses and that it would outsource printing to Transcontinental Printing, leading to the layoff of all 285 staff at the plant as Transcontinental has its own existing facility, also in Vaughan. In April 2018, the Toronto Star expanded its local coverage of Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Halifax with rebranded daily newspapers, previously known as Metro, as StarMetro, which was a joint venture between Torstar (90%) and Swedish media company Metro International (10%). In October 2018, the Toronto Star acquired iPolitics, a political news outlet. On December 20, 2019, all StarMetro editions ceased publication amid the popularity and resultant growth of news apps on mobile devices. Local coverage once again became restricted to the Golden Horseshoe conurbation."

        "content": "Like its competitor The Globe and Mail, the Star covers \"a spectrum of opinion that is best described as urban and Central Canadian\" in character. The Star is generally centrist and centre-left, and is more socially liberal than The Globe and Mail. The paper has aligned itself over the years with the progressive \"Atkinson principles\" named for publisher Joseph E. Atkinson, who was editor and publisher of the paper for 50 years. These principles included social justice and social welfare provision, as well as individual rights and civil liberties. In 1984, scholar Wilfred H. Kesterton described the Star as \"perpetually indignant\" because of its social consciousness. When Atkinson's son Joseph Story Atkinson became president of the Star in 1957, he said, \"From its inception in 1892, the Star has been a champion of social and economic reform, a defender of minority rights, a foe of discrimination, a friend of organized labour and a staunch advocate of Canadian nationhood.\" Another of the \"Atkinson principles\" has been a \"strong, united and independent Canada\"; in a 1927 editorial, the paper wrote, \"We believe in the British connection as much as anybody does but on a self-respecting basis of equality, of citizenship, and not on the old basis of one country belonging to the other.\" The paper was historically wary of American influence, and during the debates over the North American Free Trade Agreement, the paper was frequently critical of free trade and expressed concerns about Canadian sovereignty. The paper has been traditionally supportive of official bilingualism and maintaining Canadian unity in opposition to Quebec separatism. In the 1980s, Michael Farber wrote in the Montreal Gazette that the Stars coverage was Toronto-centric to the point that any story was said to carry an explanation as to \"What it means to Metro.\" Conversely, Canadian sociologist Elke Winter wrote in 2011 that the Toronto Star was less \"Toronto-centric\" than its rival, The Globe and Mail, writing that the Star \"consciously reports for and from Canada's most multicultural city\" and catered to a diverse readership."

Elections in which the Star did not endorse the Liberals took place in 1972 and 1974 (when it endorsed the Progressive Conservatives), and 1979 and 2011 (when it endorsed the NDP). In the 2011 election, the Star endorsed the NDP under Jack Layton, but to avoid vote splitting that could inadvertently help the Conservatives under Stephen Harper, which it saw as the worst outcome for the country, the paper also recommended Canadians vote strategically by voting for \"the progressive candidate best placed to win\" in certain ridings. For the 2015 election, the Star endorsed the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau, and did so again in the 2019 federal election. In Toronto's non-partisan mayoral elections, the Star endorsed George Smitherman in 2010 and John Tory in 2014 and 2018."

The newspaper was independent of government control, but from 1931 onward, the paper's editors experienced mounting pressure from the Japanese government to submit to its policies. In 1933, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed Hitoshi Ashida, former ministry official, as chief editor. During World War II, the newspaper served as an outlet for Imperial Japanese government communication and editorial opinion. It was successively renamed The Japan Times and Mail (1918\u20131940) following its merger with The Japan Mail, The Japan Times and Advertiser (1940\u20131943) following its merger with The Japan Advertiser, and Nippon Times (1943\u20131956), before reverting to the Japan Times title in 1956. The temporary change to Nippon Times occurred during the ban on English language sentiment during World War II-era Japan. Shintaro Fukushima (1907\u20131987) became president of The Japan Times in 1956. He sold some of the company's shares to Toshiaki Ogasawara  (\u5c0f\u7b20\u539f \u654f\u6676 Ogasawara Toshiaki), who was chairman of Nifco, a manufacturer of automotive fasteners. Fukushima renounced management rights in 1983, after which Nifco acquired control of The Japan Times and brought about staff changes and alterations to the company's traditions established in 1897. Ogasawara served as the chairman and publisher of The Japan Times until 2016, when his daughter Yukiko Ogasawara (\u5c0f\u7b20\u539f \u6709\u8f1d\u5b50 Ogasawara Yukiko) succeeded him as chairman of the company. She had previously served as the company's president from 2006 to 2012, when she was replaced by career Japan Times staffer Takeharu Tsutsumi. Nifco sold The Japan Times to PR firm News2u Holdings, Inc. on 30\u00a0June 2017."

In response to these criticisms, The Japan Times wrote in an article on 7 December 2018, \"We must admit that the editorial note undermined the relationships of trust we have built with our readers, reporters and staff.

        "title": "Kid A_Summary",
        "content": "Kid A is the fourth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 2 October 2000 by Parlophone. It was recorded with producer Nigel Godrich in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and their hometown of Oxford, England. After the stress of promoting Radiohead's acclaimed 1997 album OK Computer, songwriter Thom Yorke wanted to diverge from rock music. Drawing influence from electronic music, ambient music, krautrock, jazz, and 20th-century classical music, Radiohead used instruments such as modular synthesisers, ondes Martenot, brass and strings. They processed guitar sounds, incorporated samples and loops, and manipulated their recordings with software such as Pro Tools and Cubase. Yorke wrote impersonal and abstract lyrics, cutting up phrases and assembling them at random. Radiohead considered releasing the material as a double album, but decided it was too dense; a second album of material from the sessions, Amnesiac, was released eight months later. Kid A was widely anticipated. In a departure from industry practice, Radiohead released no singles or music videos and conducted few interviews and photoshoots. Instead, they became one of the first major acts to use the internet as a promotional tool; Kid A was made available to stream and was promoted with short animated films featuring music and artwork. Bootlegs of early performances were shared on filesharing services, and the album was leaked before release. In 2000, Radiohead toured Europe in a custom-built tent without corporate logos. Kid A debuted at the top of the UK Albums Chart, and became Radiohead's first number-one album in the United States, where it sold over 207,000 copies in its first week. It has been certified platinum in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the US and the UK. Like OK Computer, it won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Its departure from Radiohead's earlier sound divided fans and critics, and some dismissed it as pretentious, deliberately obscure, or derivative. However, it later attracted wide acclaim; at the end of the decade, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times ranked Kid A the greatest album of the 2000s, and in 2020 Rolling Stone ranked it number 20 on its updated list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Kid A Mnesia, an anniversary reissue compiling Kid A, Amnesiac and previously unreleased material, was released in 2021."

        "title": "Kid A_Background",
        "content": "Following the critical and commercial success of their 1997 album OK Computer, the members of Radiohead suffered burnout. Songwriter Thom Yorke became ill, describing himself as \"a complete fucking mess ... completely unhinged\". Troubled by new acts he felt were imitating Radiohead, he believed his music had become part of a constant background noise he described as \"fridge buzz\", and he became hostile to the music media. He told The Guardian: \"I always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with things, and I sort of felt like that the thing that helped me deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and I was simply doing its bidding. And I couldn't handle that.\" Yorke suffered from writer's block, and could not finish writing songs on guitar. He became disillusioned with the \"mythology\" of rock music, feeling the genre had \"run its course\". He began to listen almost exclusively to the electronic music of Warp artists such as Boards of Canada, Aphex Twin and Autechre, and said: \"It was refreshing because the music was all structures and had no human voices in it. But I felt just as emotional about it as I'd ever felt about guitar music.\" He liked the idea of his voice being used as an instrument rather than having a leading role, and wanted to focus on sounds and textures instead of traditional songwriting. Yorke bought a house in Cornwall and spent his time walking the cliffs and drawing, restricting his musical activity to playing the grand piano he had recently bought. \"Everything in Its Right Place\" was the first song he wrote. He described himself as a \"shit piano player\", with little knowledge of electronic instruments: \"I remember this Tom Waits quote from years ago, that what keeps him going as a songwriter is his complete ignorance of the instruments he's using. So everything's a novelty. That's one of the reasons I wanted to get into computers and synths, because I didn't understand how the fuck they worked. I had no idea what ADSR meant.\" Guitarist Ed O'Brien had hoped Radiohead's fourth album would comprise short, melodic guitar songs, but Yorke stated: \"There was no chance of the album sounding like that. I'd completely had it with melody. I just wanted rhythm. All melodies to me were pure embarrassment.\" Bassist Colin Greenwood said: \"We felt we had to change everything. There were other guitar bands out there trying to do similar things. We had to move on.\""

        "content": "Radiohead began work on Kid A in Paris in January 1999 with OK Computer producer Nigel Godrich and no deadline. Yorke, who had the greatest control, was still facing writer's block. His new songs were incomplete, and some consisted of little more than sounds or rhythms; few had clear verses or choruses. Yorke's lack of lyrics created problems, as these had provided points of reference and inspiration for his bandmates in the past. The group struggled with Yorke's new direction; according to Godrich, Yorke did not communicate much, and according to Yorke, Godrich \"didn't understand why, if we had such a strength in one thing, we would want to do something else\". Multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood feared \"awful art-rock nonsense just for its own sake\"; his brother, Colin, did not enjoy Yorke's Warp influences, finding them \"really cold\". The other band members were unsure of how to contribute, and considered leaving. O'Brien said: \"It's scary\u00a0\u2013 everyone feels insecure. I'm a guitarist and suddenly it's like, well, there are no guitars on this track, or no drums.\" Radiohead experimented with electronic instruments including modular synthesisers and the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument similar to a theremin, and used software such as Pro Tools and Cubase to edit and manipulate their recordings. The group found it difficult to use electronic instruments and techniques collaboratively; according to Yorke, \"We had to develop ways of going off into corners and build things on whatever sequencer, synthesiser or piece of machinery we would bring to the equation and then integrate that into the way we would normally work.\" O'Brien began using sustain units, which allow guitar notes to be sustained infinitely, combined with looping and delay effects to create synthesiser-like sounds. In March, Radiohead moved to Medley Studios in Copenhagen for two weeks, which were unproductive. The sessions produced about 50 reels of tape, each containing 15 minutes of music, with nothing finished. In April, Radiohead resumed recording in a mansion in Batsford Park, Gloucestershire. The lack of deadline and the number of incomplete ideas made it hard to focus, and  the group held tense meetings; they agreed to disband if they could not agree on an album worth releasing. In July, O'Brien began keeping an online diary of Radiohead's progress, and Radiohead moved to their new studio in their hometown of Oxford. In November, Radiohead held a live webcast from their studio, featuring a performance of new music and a DJ set. By 2000, six songs were complete. In January, at Godrich's suggestion, Radiohead split into two groups: one would generate a sound or sequence without acoustic instruments such as guitars or drums, and the other would develop it. Though the experiment produced no finished songs, it helped convince O'Brien of the potential of electronic instruments. On 19 April 2000, Yorke wrote on Radiohead's website that they had finished recording. Having completed over 20 songs, Radiohead considered a double album, but felt the material was too dense. Instead, they saved half the songs for their next album, Amnesiac, released the following year. Yorke said Radiohead split the work into two albums because \"they cancel each other out as overall finished things. They come from two different places.\" He observed that deciding the track list was not just a matter of choosing the best songs, as \"you can put all the best songs in the world on a record and they'll ruin each other\". He cited the later Beatles albums as examples of effective sequencing: \"How in the hell can you have three different versions of 'Revolution' on the same record and get away with it? I thought about that sort of thing.\" Agreeing on the track list created arguments, and O'Brien said the band came close to breaking up: \"That felt like it could go either way, it could break ... But we came in the next day and it was resolved.\" The album was mastered by Chris Blair in Abbey Road Studios, London."

        "title": "Kid A_Tracks",
        "content": "Radiohead worked on the first track, \"Everything in its Right Place\", in a conventional band arrangement in Copenhagen and Paris, but without results. In Gloucestershire, Yorke and Godrich transferred the song to a Prophet-5 synthesiser, and Yorke's vocals were processed in Pro Tools using a scrubbing tool. O'Brien and drummer Philip Selway said the track helped them accept that not every song needed every band member to play on it. O'Brien recalled: \"To be genuinely sort of delighted that you'd been working for six months on this record and something great has come out of it, and you haven't contributed to it, is a really liberating feeling.\" Jonny Greenwood described it as a turning point for the album: \"We knew it had to be the first song, and everything just followed after it.\" Yorke wrote an early version of \"The National Anthem\" when the band was still in school. In 1997, Radiohead recorded drums and bass for the song, intending to develop it as a B-side for OK Computer, but decided to keep it for their next album. For Kid A, Greenwood added ondes Martenot and sounds sampled from radio stations, and Yorke's vocals were processed with a ring modulator. In November 1999, Radiohead recorded a brass section inspired by the \"organised chaos\" of Town Hall Concert by the jazz musician Charles Mingus, instructing the musicians to sound like a \"traffic jam\". The strings on \"How To Disappear Completely\" were performed by the Orchestra of St John's and recorded in Dorchester Abbey, a 12th-century church about five miles from Radiohead's Oxfordshire studio. Radiohead chose the orchestra as they had performed pieces by Penderecki and Messiaen. Jonny Greenwood, the only Radiohead member trained in music theory, composed the string arrangement by multitracking his ondes Martenot. According to Godrich, when the orchestra members saw Greenwood's score \"they all just sort of burst into giggles, because they couldn't do what he'd written, because it was impossible\u00a0\u2013 or impossible for them, anyway\". The orchestra leader John Lubbock encouraged them to experiment and work with Greenwood's ideas. Concerts director Alison Atkinson said the session was \"more experimental\" than the orchestra's usual bookings. \"Idioteque\" samples two computer music pieces, Paul Lansky's \"Mild Und Leise\" and Arthur Kreiger's \"Short Piece\". Both samples were taken from Electronic Music Winners, a 1976 experimental music LP which Jonny Greenwood stumbled upon while the band was working on Kid A. The track was built from a drum machine pattern Greenwood created with a modular synthesiser and a sample from \"Mild und Leise\". He gave the 50-minute recording to Yorke, who took a short section of it and used it to write the song. Yorke also referred to electronic dance music when talking about \"Idioteque\", and said that the song was \"an attempt to capture that exploding beat sound where you're at the club and the PA's so loud, you know it's doing damage\". \"Motion Picture Soundtrack\" was written before Radiohead's debut single \"Creep\", and a version of it was recorded on piano during the OK Computer sessions. Yorke recorded it on a pedal organ, influenced by songwriter Tom Waits; the other band members added sampled harp and double bass, attempting to emulate the soundtracks of 1950s Disney films. Radiohead also worked on several songs that were not completed until recording sessions for future albums, including \"Nude\", \"Burn the Witch\" and \"True Love Waits\"."

        "content": "Kid A incorporates influences from electronic artists on Warp Records such as 1990s IDM artists Autechre and Aphex Twin; 1970s Krautrock bands such as Can; the jazz of Charles Mingus, Alice Coltrane and Miles Davis; and abstract hip hop from the Mo'Wax label, including Blackalicious and DJ Krush. Yorke cited Remain in Light (1980) by Talking Heads as a \"massive reference point\". Bj\u00f6rk was another major influence, particularly her 1997 album Homogenic, as was the Beta Band. Radiohead attended an Underworld concert which helped renew their enthusiasm in a difficult moment. The string orchestration for \"How to Disappear Completely\" was influenced by Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki. Jonny Greenwood's use of the ondes Martenot on this and several other Kid A songs was inspired by Olivier Messiaen, who popularised the instrument and was one of Greenwood's teenage heroes. Greenwood described his interest in mixing old and new music technology, and during the recording sessions Yorke read Ian MacDonald's Revolution in the Head, which chronicles the Beatles' recordings with George Martin during the 1960s. The band also sought to combine electronic manipulations with jam sessions in the studio, stating their model was the German group Can. Kid A has been described as a work of electronica, experimental rock, post-rock, alternative rock, post-prog, ambient, electronic rock, art rock, and art pop. Though guitar is less prominent than on previous Radiohead albums, guitars were still used on most tracks. \"Treefingers\", an instrumental ambient track, was created by digitally processing O'Brien's guitar loops. Many of Yorke's vocals are heavily modified by digital effects; for example, his vocals on the title track were simply spoken, then vocoded with the ondes Martenot to create the melody."

        "content": "Yorke's lyrics on Kid A are less personal than on earlier albums, instead heavily incorporating abstract and surreal themes. He cut up phrases and assembled them at random, combining cliches and banal observations; for instance, \"Morning Bell\" features repetitions of contrasting lines such as \"Where'd you park the car?\" and \"Cut the kids in half\". He cited David Byrne's approach on the 1980 Talking Heads album Remain in Light as an influence: \"When they made that record, they had no real songs, just wrote it all as they went along. Byrne turned up with pages and pages, and just picked stuff up and threw bits in all the time. And that's exactly how I approached Kid A.\" Radiohead used Yorke's lyrics \"like pieces in a collage ... [creating] an artwork out of a lot of different little things\". The lyrics are not included in the liner notes, as Radiohead felt they could not be considered independently of the music, and Yorke said he did not want listeners to focus on them. Yorke wrote \"Everything in Its Right Place\" about the depression he experienced on the OK Computer tour, feeling he could not speak. The refrain of \"How to Disappear Completely\" was inspired by R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe, who advised Yorke to relieve tour stress by repeating to himself: \"I'm not here, this isn't happening\". The refrain of \"Optimistic\" (\"try the best you can / the best you can is good enough\") was an assurance by Yorke's partner, Rachel Owen, when Yorke was frustrated with the band's progress. The title Kid A came from a filename on one of Yorke's sequencers. Yorke said he liked its \"non-meaning\", saying: \"If you call [an album] something specific, it drives the record in a certain way.\""

        "content": "The Kid A artwork and packaging was created by Yorke with Stanley Donwood, who has worked with Radiohead since their 1994 EP My Iron Lung. Donwood painted on large canvases with knives and sticks, then photographed the paintings and manipulated them with Photoshop. While working on the artwork, Yorke and Donwood became \"obsessed\" with the Worldwatch Institute website, which was full of \"scary statistics about ice caps melting, and weather patterns changing\"; this inspired them to use an image of a mountain range as the cover art. Donwood said he saw the mountains as \"some sort of cataclysmic power\". Donwood was inspired by a photograph taken during the Kosovo War depicting a square metre of snow full of the \"detritus of war\", such as military equipment and cigarette stains. He said: \"I was upset by it in a way war had never upset me before. It felt like it was happening in my street.\" The red swimming pool on the album spine and disc was inspired by the 1988 graphic novel Brought to Light by Alan Moore and Bill Sienkiewicz, in which the number of people killed by state terrorism is measured in swimming pools filled with blood. Donwood said this image \"haunted\" him during the recording of the album, calling it \"a symbol of looming danger and shattered expectations\". Yorke and Donwood cited an exhibition of paintings by David Hockney they attended in Paris, before recording started, as another influence. Yorke and Donwood made many versions of the album cover, with different pictures and different titles in different typefaces. Unable to decide, they taped them to the kitchen cupboards and went to bed. According to Donwood, the choice the next day \"was obvious\". In October 2021, Yorke and Donwood curated an exhibition of Kid A artwork at Christie's headquarters in London."

        "content": "Radiohead minimised their involvement in promotion for Kid A, conducting few interviews or photoshoots. They released no singles, though \"Optimistic\" and promotional copies of other tracks received radio play. Yorke said the decision not to release singles was to avoid the stress of publicity, which he had struggled with on OK Computer, rather than for artistic reasons. No advance copies of Kid A were circulated, but it was played under controlled conditions for critics and fans. Radiohead were careful to present it as a cohesive work rather than a series of separate tracks; rather than give EMI executives copies to consider individually, they had them listen to the album in its entirety on a bus from Hollywood to Malibu. Rob Gordon, vice president of marketing at Capitol Records, the American subsidiary of Radiohead's label EMI, praised the album but said promoting it would be a \"business challenge\". Promotional copies of Kid A came with stickers prohibiting broadcast before September 19. At midnight, it was played in its entirety by the London radio station Xfm. MTV2, KROQ, and WXRK also played the album in its entirety. Rather than agree to a standard magazine photoshoot for Q, Radiohead supplied digitally altered portraits, with their skin smoothed, their irises recoloured, and Yorke's drooping eyelid removed. Q editor Andrew Harrison described the images as \"aggressively weird to the point of taking the piss ... all five of Radiohead had been given the aspect of gawking aliens\". Yorke told Q: \"I'd like to see them try to put these pictures on a poster.\" Q projected them onto the Houses of Parliament, placed them on posters and billboards in the London Underground and on the Old Street Roundabout, and had them printed on key rings, mugs and mouse mats, to \"turn Radiohead back into a product\". Instead of releasing traditional music videos for Kid A, Radiohead commissioned dozens of 10-second videos featuring Donwood artwork they called \"blips\", which were aired on music channels and distributed online. Pitchfork described them as \"context-free animated nightmares that radiated mystery\", with \"arch hints of surveillance\". Five of the videos were serviced as exclusives to MTV, and \"helped play into the arty mystique that endeared Radiohead to its core audience\", according to Billboard."

The \"iBlip\", a Java applet, could be embedded in fan sites and allowed users to preorder and stream the album; it was used by over 1000 sites and the album was streamed more than 400,000 times. The iBlip also included artwork, photos and links to order the album on the online retailer Amazon. Capitol also streamed the album through Amazon, MTV.com and heavy.com, and ran a campaign with the peer-to-peer filesharing service Aimster, allowing users to swap iBlips and Radiohead-branded Aimster skins. Donwood wrote that EMI was not interested in the Radiohead website, and left him and the band to update it with \"discursive and random content\", including images of an \"angry-looking\" teddy bear with pointed teeth. The bears originated in stories Donwood made for his young children about teddy bears who came to life and ate the \"grown-ups\" who had abandoned them, and became a staple of the Kid A website and promotional material. Three weeks before release, Kid A was leaked online and shared on the peer-to-peer service Napster. Asked whether he believed Napster had damaged sales, Capitol president Ray Lott likened the situation to unfounded concern about home taping in the 1980s and said: \"I'm trying to sell as many Radiohead albums as possible. If I worried about what Napster would do, I wouldn't sell as many albums.\" Yorke said Napster \"encourages enthusiasm for music in a way that the music industry has long forgotten to do\"."

        "content": "Radiohead rearranged the Kid A songs to perform them live. O'Brien said, \"You couldn't do Kid A live and be true to the record. You would have to do it like an art installation ... When we played live, we put the human element back into it.\" Selway said they \"found some new life\" in the songs when they came to perform them. In mid-2000, months before Kid A was released, Radiohead toured the Mediterranean, performing Kid A and Amnesiac songs for the first time. Fans shared concert bootlegs online. Colin Greenwood said: \"We played in Barcelona and the next day the entire performance was up on Napster. Three weeks later when we got to play in Israel the audience knew the words to all the new songs and it was wonderful.\" Later that year, Radiohead toured Europe in a custom-built tent without corporate logos, playing mostly new songs. The tour included a homecoming show in South Park, Oxford, with supporting performances by Humphrey Lyttelton (who performed on Amnesiac), Beck and Sigur R\u00f3s. According to journalist Alex Ross, the show may have been the largest public gathering in Oxford history. Radiohead also performed three concerts in North American theatres, their first in nearly three years. The small venues sold out rapidly, attracting celebrities, and fans camped overnight. In October, Radiohead performed on the American TV show Saturday Night Live; the performance shocked viewers expecting rock songs, with Jonny Greenwood playing electronic instruments, the house brass band improvising over \"The National Anthem\", and Yorke dancing erratically to \"Idioteque\". Rolling Stone described the Kid A tour as \"a revelation, exposing rock and roll humanity\" in the songs. In November 2001, Radiohead released I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings, comprising performances from the Kid A and Amnesiac tours."

It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, selling 55,000 copies in its first day \u2013 the biggest first-day sales of the year and more than every other album in the top ten combined. Kid A also debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling more than 207,000 copies in its first week. It was Radiohead's first US top-20 album, and the first US number one in three years for any British act. Kid A also debuted at number one in Canada, where it sold more than 44,000 copies in its first week, and in France, Ireland and New Zealand. European sales slowed on 2 October 2000, the day of release, when EMI recalled 150,000 faulty CDs. By June 2001, Kid A had sold 310,000 copies in the UK, less than a third of OK Computer sales. It is certified platinum in the UK, Australia, Canada, France, Japan and the US."

        "title": "Kid A_Critical reception",
        "content": "Kid A was widely anticipated; Spin described it as the most anticipated rock record since Nirvana's In Utero. According to Andrew Harrison, then editor of Q, journalists expected it to provide more of the \"rousing, cathartic, lots-of-guitar, Saturday-night-at-Glastonbury big future rock moments\" of OK Computer. Months before its release, Melody Maker wrote: \"If there's one band that promises to return rock to us, it's Radiohead.\" After Kid A had been played for critics, many bemoaned the lack of guitar, obscured vocals, and unconventional song structures, and some called the album \"a commercial suicide note\". The Guardian wrote of the \"muted electronic hums, pulses and tones\", predicting that it would confuse listeners. Mojo wrote that \"upon first listen, Kid A is just awful ... Too often it sounds like the fragments that they began the writing process with\u00a0\u2013 a loop, a riff, a mumbled line of text, have been set in concrete and had other, lesser ideas piled on top.\" Guardian critic Adam Sweeting wrote that \"even listeners raised on krautrock or Ornette Coleman will find Kid A a mystifying experience\", and that it pandered to \"the worst cliches\" about Radiohead's \"relentless miserabilism\". Several critics felt Kid A was pretentious or deliberately obscure. The Irish Times bemoaned the lack of conventional song structures and panned the album as \"deliberately abstruse, wilfully esoteric and wantonly unfathomable ... The only thing challenging about Kid A is the very real challenge to your attention span.\" In the New Yorker, novelist Nick Hornby wrote that it was \"morbid proof that this sort of self-indulgence results in a weird kind of anonymity rather than something distinctive and original\". Melody Maker critic Mark Beaumont called it \"tubby, ostentatious, self-congratulatory, look-ma-I-can-suck-my-own-cock whiny old rubbish ... About 60 songs were started that no one had a bloody clue how to finish.\" Alexis Petridis of the Guardian described it as \"self-consciously awkward and bloody-minded, the noise made by a band trying so hard to make a 'difficult' album that they felt it beneath them to write any songs\". Rolling Stone published a piece by Michael Krugman and Jason Cohen mocking Kid A as humourless, derivative and lacking in songs; they wrote: \"Because it was decided that Radiohead were Important and Significant last time around, no one can accept the album as the crackpot art project it so obviously is.\" Some critics felt the electronic elements were unoriginal. In the New York Times, Howard Hampton dismissed Radiohead as a \"rock composite\" and wrote that Kid A \"recycles Pink Floyd's dark-side-of-the-moon solipsism to Me-Decade perfection\". Beaumont said Radiohead were \"simply ploughing furrows dug by DJ Shadow and Brian Eno before them\"; the Irish Times felt the ambient elements were inferior to Eno's 1978 album Music For Airports and its \"scary\" elements inferior to Scott Walker's 1995 album Tilt. Select wrote: \"What do they want for sounding like the Aphex Twin circa 1993, a medal?\" Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone later wrote that the \"mastery of Warp-style electronic effects\" had appeared \"clumsy and dated\". In an NME editorial, James Oldham wrote that the electronic influences were \"mired in compromise\", with Radiohead still operating as a rock band, and concluded: \"Time will judge it. But right now, Kid A has the ring of a lengthy, over-analysed mistake.\" Warp co-founder Rob Mitchell felt Kid A represented \"an honest interpretation of [Warp] influences\" and was not gratuitously electronic. He predicted it might one day be seen in the same way as David Bowie's 1977 album Low, which alienated some Bowie fans but was later acclaimed. AllMusic gave Kid A a favourable review, but wrote that it \"never is as visionary or stunning as OK Computer, nor does it really repay the intensive time it demands in order for it to sink in\". The NME review was also positive, but described some songs as \"meandering\" and \"anticlimactic\", and concluded: \"For all its feats of brinkmanship, the patently magnificent construct called Kid A betrays a band playing one-handed just to prove they can, scared to commit itself emotionally.\" In Rolling Stone, David Fricke called Kid A \"a work of deliberately inky, often irritating obsession\u00a0... But this is pop, a music of ornery, glistening guile and honest ache, and it will feel good under your skin once you let it get there.\" Spin said Kid A was \"not the act of career suicide or feat of self-indulgence it will be castigated as\", and predicted that fans would recognise it as Radiohead's \"best and bravest\" album. Billboard described it as \"an ocean of unparalleled musical depth\" and \"the first truly groundbreaking album of the 21st century\". Robert Christgau wrote that Kid A was \"an imaginative, imitative variation on a pop staple: sadness made pretty\". The Village Voice called it \"oblique oblique oblique\u00a0... Also incredibly beautiful.\" Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork gave Kid A a perfect score, calling it \"cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike\". He concluded that Radiohead \"must be the greatest band alive, if not the best since you know who\". The piece was one of the first Kid A reviews posted online; shared widely by Radiohead fans, it helped popularise Pitchfork and became notorious for its \"obtuse\" writing. At Metacritic, which aggregates ratings from critics, Kid A has a score of 80 based on 24 reviews, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\". It was named one of the best albums of 2000 by publications including the Los Angeles Times, Spin, Melody Maker, Mojo, NME, Pitchfork, Q, the Times, Uncut, and the Wire. At the 2001 Grammy Awards, Kid A was nominated for Album of the Year and won for Best Alternative Album."

        "content": "In the years following its release, Kid A attracted acclaim. In 2005, Pitchfork wrote that it had \"challenged and confounded\" Radiohead's audience, and subsequently \"transformed into an intellectual symbol of sorts\u00a0... Owning it became 'getting it'; getting it became 'anointing it'.\" In 2015, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone likened Radiohead's change in style to Bob Dylan's controversial move to rock music, writing that critics now hesitated to say they had disliked it at the time. He described Kid A as the \"defining moment in the Radiohead legend\". A year later, Billboard argued that Kid A was the first album since Bowie's Low to have moved \"rock and electronic music forward in such a mature fashion\". In an article for Kid A's 20th anniversary, the Quietus suggested that the negative reviews had been motivated by rockism, the tendency among music critics to venerate rock music over other genres. Some critics still disliked the album. In a 2011 Guardian article about his critical Melody Maker review, Beaumont wrote that though his opinion had not changed, \"Kid A status as a cultural cornerstone has proved me, if not wrong, then very much in the minority\u00a0... People whose opinions I trust claim it to be their favourite album ever.\" In 2014, Brice Ezell of PopMatters wrote that Kid A is \"more fun to think and write about than it is to actually listen to\" and a \"far less compelling representation of the band's talents than The Bends and OK Computer\". In 2016, Dorian Lysnkey wrote in the Guardian: \"At times, Kid A is dull enough to make you fervently wish that they'd merged the highlights with the best bits of the similarly spotty Amnesiac ... Yorke had given up on coherent lyrics so one can only guess at what he was worrying about.\" Radiohead denied that they had set out to create \"difficult\" music. Jonny Greenwood argued that the tracks were short and melodic, and suggested that \"people basically want their hands held through 12 'Mull Of Kintyre's\". Yorke said: \"We're actually trying to communicate but, somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people\u00a0... What we're doing isn't that radical.\" He recalled that the band had been \"white as a sheet\" before early performances on the Kid A tour, thinking they had been \"absolutely trashed\". At the same time, the reaction motivated them: \"There was a sense of a fight to convince people, which was actually really exciting.\" He regretted having released no singles, feeling it meant much of the early judgement of the album came from critics. Grantland credited Kid A for pioneering the use of internet to stream and promote music, writing: \"For many music fans of a certain age and persuasion, Kid A was the first album experienced primarily via the internet\u00a0\u2013 it's where you went to hear it, read the reviews, and argue about whether it was a masterpiece\u00a0... Listen early, form an opinion quickly, state it publicly, and move on to the next big record by the official release date. In that way, Kid A invented modern music culture as we know it.\" In his 2005 book Killing Yourself to Live, critic Chuck Klosterman interpreted Kid A as a prediction of the September 11 attacks. Speaking at Radiohead's induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2019, David Byrne of Talking Heads, one of Radiohead's formative influences, said: \"What was really weird and very encouraging was that [Kid A] was popular. It was a hit! It proved to me that the artistic risk paid off and music fans sometimes are not stupid.\" In 2020, Billboard wrote that the success of Kid A,  despite its \"challenging\" content, established Radiohead as \"heavy hitters in the business for the long run\"."

[It] remains one of the more stunning sonic makeovers in music history.\" In previous versions of the list, Kid A ranked at number 67 (2012) and number 428 (2003). In 2005, Stylus and Pitchfork named Kid A the best album of the previous five years, with Pitchfork calling it \"the perfect record for its time: ominous, surreal, and impossibly millennial\". In 2006, Time named Kid A one of the 100 best albums of all time, calling it \"the opposite of easy listening, and the weirdest album to ever sell a million copies, but ... also a testament to just how complicated pop music can be\". At the end of the decade, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times ranked Kid A the greatest album of the 2000s. The Guardian ranked it second best, calling it \"a jittery premonition of the troubled, disconnected, overloaded decade to come. The sound of today, in other words, a decade early.\" In 2011, Rolling Stone named \"Everything in its Right Place\" the 24th best song of the 2000s, describing it as \"oddness at its most hummable\". \"Idioteque\" was named one of the best songs of the decade by Pitchfork and Rolling Stone, and Rolling Stone ranked it #33 on its 2018 list of the \"greatest songs of the century so far\". In 2021, Pitchfork readers voted Kid A the greatest album of the previous 25 years."

In August 2009, EMI reissued Kid A in a two-CD \"Collector's Edition\" and a \"Special Collector's Edition\" containing an additional DVD. Both versions feature live tracks, taken mostly from television performances. Radiohead, who left EMI in 2007, had no input into the reissue and the music was not remastered. The \"Collector's Editions\" were discontinued after Radiohead's back catalogue was transferred to XL Recordings in 2016. In May 2016, XL reissued Kid A on vinyl, along with the rest of Radiohead's back catalogue. An early demo of \"The National Anthem\" was included in the special edition of the 2017 OK Computer reissue OKNOTOK 1997 2017. In February 2020, Radiohead released an extended version of \"Treefingers\", previously released on the soundtrack for the 2000 film Memento, to digital platforms. On November 5, 2021, Radiohead released Kid A Mnesia, an anniversary reissue compiling Kid A and Amnesiac. It includes a third album, Kid Amnesiae, comprising previously unreleased material from the sessions. Radiohead promoted the reissue with two digital singles, the previously unreleased tracks \"If You Say the Word\" and \"Follow Me Around\". Kid A Mnesia Exhibition, an interactive experience with music and artwork from the albums, was released on November 18 for PlayStation 5, macOS and Windows."

Especially given Adam's art-schooled vocals, I find that the hooks grate, but that may just mean that when it comes to futuristic warriors I prefer Sandinistas.\" In his retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it \"one of the great defining albums of its time. There's simply nothing else like it, nothing else that has the same bravado, the same swagger, the same gleeful self-aggrandizement and sense of camp. This walked a brilliant line between campiness and art-house chutzpah, and it arrived at precisely the right time \u2013 at the forefront of new wave\".

        "content": "In an effort to capitalize on the recent UK chart success of their eponymous debut album, Black Sabbath returned to the studio with producer Rodger Bain in June 1970, just four months after the album was released. Paranoid was recorded at Regent Sound Studios and Island Studios in London, England. The album's title track was written as an afterthought. As drummer Bill Ward explains: \"We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony (Iommi) just played the guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom.\" In the liner notes to the 1998 live album Reunion, bassist Geezer Butler recounts to Phil Alexander that they wrote the song \"in five minutes, then I sat down and wrote the lyrics as quickly as I could. It was all done in about two hours.\" According to Alexander, \"Paranoid\" \"crystallized the band's writing process, with Iommi initiating the ideas with his charred riffs, Ozzy (Osbourne) working on a melody, Geezer providing drive and the majority of the lyrics, and Bill Ward locking into a set of often pounding rhythms beneath Butler's bass rumble.\" The single was released in September 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit. Most of the songs on Paranoid evolved during onstage improvisational jams. In the Classic Albums documentary on the making of Paranoid, guitarist Tony Iommi recalls that \"War Pigs\" came from \"one of the clubs\" with Butler adding, \"During the song \"Warning\" we used to jam that out and that particular night when we were jamming it out Tony just went da-dum!\" In the same documentary, Iommi demonstrates his approach to the guitar solo in the song, explaining that \"I always tried to keep the bottom string ringing so it fills it out nicely.\" On \"Planet Caravan\", Osbourne sings through a Leslie speaker, with the singer telling Mojo in 2010, \"Then Rodger Bain used an oscillator on it \u2013 whatever that is. It looks like a fridge with a knob on.\""

        "title": "Paranoid (album)_Composition",
        "content": "The album's opening track \"War Pigs\" was originally intended to be called \"Walpurgis\". It was then changed to \"War Pigs\", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that the song of the same name had potential as a single. Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: \"I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' \u2013 you know, the Satanic version of Christmas \u2013 write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not going to call it that. Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'.\" In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, \"It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis'... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't interested in your average 'I love you' pop song... Geezer also liked to put a lot of topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had his ear to the ground, Geezer did.\" The song \"Iron Man\" was originally entitled \"Iron Bloke\". Upon hearing Iommi play the main guitar riff for the first time, Osbourne remarked in awe that it sounded \"like a big iron bloke walking around\". The title was later changed to \"Iron Man\" as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. The riff to \"Iron Man\" is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that \"...Tony Iommi turned out to be one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff \u2013 and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away.\" Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. His attempts to warn the populace are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and vengeful, causing the destruction seen in his vision. \"Electric Funeral\" also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands \"it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life.\" In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne said: \"It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday... And suddenly, you know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet. \"You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world,\" Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, \"and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that I wanted to talk about \u2013 political stuff \u2013 so that's what inspired me.\" In 2013, Butler told Mojo magazine that the song \"Paranoid\" was \"about depression, because I didn't really know the difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards.\" In 2015, Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: \"I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. I used to get really depressed and it was the only thing that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself.\" According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's \"Communication Breakdown\", with the bassist admitting, \"I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time.\" \"Planet Caravan\" was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, \"It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, \"We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend.\" Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. \"Hand of Doom\" dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was \"nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to \"Hand of Doom\", that's what I wrote it about.\" According to Butler, Ward's drum solo \"Rat Salad\" resulted from the band having to play 8 and 3/4-hour spots a night in Europe early in their career. \"Bill used to fill out a whole 45 minutes doing a drum solo just to get rid of that 45 minutes,\" he revealed to Classic Albums. \"I have no idea where the title came from, though.\" While Butler may have now forgotten where the title of \"Rat Salad\" came from, in 1971 he was on record stating it came from a joke about Ward's hair having not been combed. In 2013, Sabbath biographer Mick Wall described the closing track on the album, \"Fairies Wear Boots\", as a \"hard-driving riff sweetened by a beautifully baleful melody\" with a lyric written by Osbourne about a nasty encounter with a group of skinheads."

        "content": "Paranoid was originally titled War Pigs, but the record company allegedly changed it out of fear of a backlash from supporters of the ongoing Vietnam War. Additionally, the band's label felt the title track was more marketable as a single. Ozzy Osbourne states in I Am Ozzy that the name change had nothing to do with the Vietnam War, and was entirely due to the record company deciding the album would be easier to sell if it was named after the single, which had already had significant success by the time the album was released, reaching number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. It was too late, however, to alter the artwork. Joe Smith, who was executive vice-president at Warner Bros. from 1970 to 1972, told Classic Albums that the rest of Warner Bros. didn't want anything to do with them: \"We were in the midst of the war ourselves in this country and what their reasoning was not that important to me. I knew we weren't going to call it 'War Pigs'.\" Regarding the song \"Paranoid\", Smith recalls, \"It was on an acetate. I remember playing it and turning the sound way up and shaking the whole building... I said 'I think that's the breakthrough album. I don't understand it but that 'Paranoid' sounds like a great title for an album and a great title for a single. \"That album title had nothing to do with the sleeve,\" Osbourne explained to Phil Alexander in 1998. \"What the fuck does a bloke dressed as a pig with a sword in his hand got to do with being paranoid, I don't know, but they decided to change the album title without changing the artwork.\" The cover, with the original War Pigs title in mind, was designed and shot by Keith Macmillan (credited as Keef) in Black Park. His assistant, Roger Brown, was the model. The original UK vinyl release was in a gatefold sleeve featuring a black-and-white photo of the band, posed outdoors on a grassy hill. Also shot by Macmillan, it was the band's first appearance on album artwork."

        "content": "The album was issued in the United Kingdom in September 1970, where its sales were enhanced by the success of the \"Paranoid\" single. \"That single attracted screaming kids\", Iommi recalled in the liner notes to Reunion in 1998. \"We saw people dancing when we played it and we decided that we shouldn't do singles for a long while after that to stay true to the fans who'd liked us before we'd become popular.\" Paranoid US release was delayed until January 1971, as the Black Sabbath album was still on the charts at the time of its UK release. Paranoid reached No.12 in the US in March 1971 with virtually no radio airplay. From contemporary reviews, an uncredited writer in Disc praised the album, declaring the groups music as \"tight, loud, simple and exciting\" with material based on \"simple, catchy riffs [...] with lyrics that don't put them in the Dylan class.\" In a retrospective review, AllMusic's Steve Huey cited Paranoid as \"one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time\", which \"defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history\". Ben Mitchell from Blender said it was \"the greatest metal album of all time\". According to Rolling Stone Joe Levy, \"Sabbath ruled for bummed-out kids in the Seventies\" and \"nearly every heavy-metal and extreme rock band of the last three decades\", including Metallica, Nirvana and Slipknot, \"owes a debt of worship\" to Iommi's \"crushing\" guitar riffs, Ward and Butler's \"Visigoth rhythm section\" and Osbourne's \"agonized bray\" on tracks such as \"Paranoid\", \"Iron Man\" and \"War Pigs\". Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), feeling he could not take the band's horror-themed music seriously enough to appreciate it as anything other than \"camp\", noting that the title cut is especially \"screamworthy\". However, he did note that the band does take musical heaviness to \"undreamt-of extremes\". The album is currently ranked at No.139 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Paranoid chart success allowed the band to tour the US for the first time in October 1970, which spawned the release of the album's second single \"Iron Man\". Although it failed to reach the top 40, \"Iron Man\" remains one of Black Sabbath's most popular songs, as well as the band's highest charting US single. As of 2014, Paranoid is Black Sabbath's best-selling album, having sold 1.6 million copies in the US since the beginning of the SoundScan era."

The album's possible influence in her decision was mentioned in the inquest, but ultimately it was decided that Black Sabbath were not to blame for her death. \"A lot of the words in the songs \u2013 a lot of the moods of the songs \u2013 are aggressive,\" Iommi acknowledged. \"Especially in the early days \u2013 Satanic, if you like... That was the way it felt, so that was the way we played. But it got out of hand. With Paranoid in England, for instance. There was a girl found dead \u2013 a nurse she was: dead in her room with our album on the turntable going round. And it was taken to court saying that it was because of the album that she was depressed and killed herself, which was totally ridiculous, I think.\" In a 1982 interview with The New Music, Butler claimed, \"If the moral majority don't understand it they'll try to put it down, or get other people to read all sorts of things into it... The moral majority sort of people picked up on the Satanic part of it. I mean, most of it was about stopping wars and that side of it, and some science fiction stuff. There wasn't that much Satanic stuff, and what there was it wasn't exactly for the devil or anything like that; it was just around at the time and we just brought it to people's attention.\" In the documentary The Black Sabbath Story, Vol. 1, Butler expresses his frustration at how fans misinterpreted the band's lyrics, stating that \"for instance, on 'Hand of Doom' they'll pick up one sentence out of that and blow it up into this big thing, like as if we're telling everyone to go and shoot smack. The whole song is against drugs.\""

        "content": "Weird Tales is an American fantasy and horror fiction pulp magazine founded by J. C. Henneberger and J. M. Lansinger in late 1922. The first issue, dated March 1923, appeared on newsstands February 18. The first editor, Edwin Baird, printed early work by H. P. Lovecraft, Seabury Quinn, and Clark Ashton Smith, all of whom went on to be popular writers, but within a year, the magazine was in financial trouble.  Henneberger sold his interest in the publisher, Rural Publishing Corporation, to Lansinger, and refinanced Weird Tales, with Farnsworth Wright as the new editor.  The first issue under Wright's control was dated November 1924.  The magazine was more successful under Wright, and despite occasional financial setbacks, it prospered over the next 15 years.  Under Wright's control, the magazine lived up to its subtitle, \"The Unique Magazine\", and published a wide range of unusual fiction. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos stories first appeared in Weird Tales, starting with \"The Call of Cthulhu\" in 1928.  These were well-received, and a group of writers associated with Lovecraft wrote other stories set in the same milieu.  Robert E. Howard was a regular contributor, and published several of his Conan the Barbarian stories in the magazine, and Seabury Quinn's series of stories about Jules de Grandin, a detective who specialized in cases involving the supernatural, was very popular with the readers.  Other well-liked authors included Nictzin Dyalhis, E. Hoffmann Price, Robert Bloch, and H. Warner Munn.  Wright published some science fiction, along with the fantasy and horror, partly because when Weird Tales was launched,  no magazines were specializing in science fiction, but he continued this policy even after the launch of magazines such as Amazing Stories in 1926.  Edmond Hamilton wrote a good deal of science fiction for Weird Tales, though after a few years, he used the magazine for his more fantastic stories, and submitted his space operas elsewhere. In 1938, the magazine was sold to William Delaney, the publisher of Short Stories, and within two years, Wright, who was ill, was replaced by Dorothy McIlwraith as editor.  Although some successful new authors and artists, such as Ray Bradbury and Hannes Bok, continued to appear, the magazine is considered by critics to have declined under McIlwraith from its heyday in the 1930s.  Weird Tales ceased publication in 1954, but since then, numerous attempts have been made to relaunch the magazine, starting in 1973.  The longest-lasting version began in 1988 and ran with an occasional hiatus for over 20 years under an assortment of publishers. In the mid-1990s, the title was changed to Worlds of Fantasy and Horror because of licensing issues, with the original title returning in 1998. The magazine is regarded by historians of fantasy and science fiction as a legend in the field, with Robert Weinberg, author of a history of the magazine, considering it \"the most important and influential of all fantasy magazines\".  Weinberg's fellow historian, Mike Ashley, is more cautious, describing it as \"second only to Unknown in significance and influence\", adding that \"somewhere in the imagination reservoir of all U.S. (and many non-U.S.) genre-fantasy and horror writers is part of the spirit of Weird Tales\"."

        "content": "In the late 19th century, popular magazines typically did not print fiction to the exclusion of other content; they would include nonfiction articles and poetry, as well.  In October 1896, Frank A. Munsey Company's Argosy magazine was the first to switch to printing only fiction, and in December of that year, it changed to using cheap wood-pulp paper.  This is now regarded by magazine historians as having been the start of the pulp magazine era.  For years, pulp magazines were successful without restricting their fiction content to any specific genre, but in 1906, Munsey launched Railroad Man's Magazine, the first title that focused on a particular niche.  Other titles that specialized in particular fiction genres followed, starting in 1915 with Detective Story Magazine, with Western Story Magazine following in 1919.  Weird fiction, science fiction, and fantasy all appeared frequently in the pulps of the day, but by the early 1920s, still no single magazine was focused on any of these genres, though The Thrill Book, launched in 1919 by Street & Smith with the intention of printing \"different\", or unusual, stories, was a near miss. In 1922, J. C. Henneberger, the publisher of College Humor and The Magazine of Fun, formed Rural Publishing Corporation of Chicago, in partnership with his former fraternity brother, J. M. Lansinger.  Their first venture was Detective Tales, a pulp magazine that appeared twice a month, starting with the October 1, 1922 issue.  It was initially unsuccessful, and as part of a refinancing plan, Henneberger decided to publish another magazine that would allow him to split some of his costs between the two titles.  Henneberger had long been an admirer of Edgar Allan Poe, so he created a fiction magazine that would focus on horror, and titled it Weird Tales."

        "content": "Henneberger chose Edwin Baird, the editor of Detective Tales, to edit Weird Tales; Farnsworth Wright was first reader, and Otis Adelbert Kline also worked on the magazine, assisting Baird.  Payment rates were low, usually between a quarter and a half cent per word; the budget went up to one cent per word for the most popular writers.  Sales were initially poor, and Henneberger soon decided to change the format from the standard pulp size to large pulp, to make the magazine more visible.  This had little long-term effect on sales, though the first issue at the new size, dated May 1923, was the only one that first year to sell out completely\u2014probably because it contained the first instalment of a popular serial, The Moon Terror, by A.G. Birch. The magazine lost a considerable amount of money under Baird's editorship: after thirteen issues, the total debt was over $40,000.  In the meantime, Detective Tales had been retitled Real Detective Tales and was making a profit, as was College Humor.  Henneberger decided to sell both magazines to Lansinger and invest the money in Weird Tales.  This did not address the $40,000 in debts, much of which was owed to the magazine's printer.  The printing company was owned by B. Cornelius, who agreed to Henneberger's suggestion that the debt should be converted to a majority interest in a new company, Popular Fiction Publishing.  This did not eliminate all of the magazine's debts, but it meant that Weird Tales could continue to publish, and perhaps return to profitability.  Cornelius agreed that if the magazine ever became profitable enough to repay him the $40,000 he had been owed, he would give up his shares in the company.  Cornelius became the company treasurer; the business manager was William (Bill) Sprenger, who had been working for Rural Publishing.  Henneberger had hopes of eventually refinancing the debt with the help of another printer, Hall Printing Company, owned by Robert Eastman. Baird stayed with Lansinger, so Henneberger wrote to H. P. Lovecraft, who had sold some stories to Weird Tales, to see if he would be interested in taking the job.  Henneberger offered ten weeks advance pay, but made it a condition that Lovecraft move to Chicago, where the magazine was headquartered.  Lovecraft described Henneberger's plans in a letter to Frank Belknap Long as \"a brand-new magazine to cover the field of Poe-Machen shudders\".  Lovecraft did not wish to leave New York, where he had recently moved with his new bride; his dislike of cold weather was another deterrent.  He spent several months considering the offer in mid-1924 without making a final decision, with Henneberger visiting him in Brooklyn more than once, but eventually either he declined or Henneberger simply gave up.  By the end of the year Wright had been hired as the new editor of Weird Tales.  The last issue under Baird's name was a combined May/June/July issue, with 192 pages\u2014a much thicker magazine than the earlier issues.  It was assembled by Wright and Kline, rather than Baird."

        "content": "Henneberger gave Wright full control of Weird Tales, and did not get involved with story selection.  In about 1921, Wright had begun to suffer from Parkinson's disease, and over the course of his editorship the symptoms grew gradually worse.  By the end of the 1920s he was unable to sign his name, and by the late 1930s Bill Sprenger was helping him get to work and back home.  The first issue with Wright as editor was dated November 1924, and the magazine immediately resumed a regular monthly schedule, with the format changing back to pulp again.  The pay rate was initially low, with a cap of half a cent per word until 1926, when the top rate was increased to one cent per word.  Some of Popular Fiction Publishing's debts were paid off over time, and the highest pay rate eventually rose to one and a half cents per word. The magazine's cover price was high for the time. Robert Bloch recalled that \"in the late Twenties and Thirties of this century...at a time when most pulp periodicals sold for a dime, its price was a quarter\". Although Popular Fiction Publishing continued to be based in Chicago, the editorial offices were in Indianapolis for a while, at two separate addresses, but moved to Chicago toward the end of 1926.  After a short period on North Broadway, the office moved to 840 North Michigan Avenue, where it would remain until 1938. In 1927, Popular Fiction Publishing issued Birch's The Moon Terror, one of Weird Tales more popular serials, as a hardcover book, including three other stories from the magazine's first year.  One of the stories, \"An Adventure in the Fourth Dimension\", was by Wright himself.  The book sold poorly, and it remained on offer in the pages of Weird Tales, at reduced prices, for twenty years.  It was at one point provided as a bonus to readers who subscribed.  In 1930 Cornelius launched a companion magazine, Oriental Stories, but the magazine was not a success, though it managed to last for over three years before Cornelius gave up.  Another financial blow occurred in late 1930 when a bank failure froze most of the magazine's cash.  Henneberger changed the schedule to bimonthly, starting with the February/March 1931 issue; six months later, with the August 1931 issue, the monthly schedule returned. Two years later Weird Tales' bank was still having financial problems, and payment to authors was being substantially delayed. The Depression also hit the Hall Printing Company, which Henneberger had been hoping would take over the debt from Cornelius; Robert Eastman, the owner of Hall, at one point was unable to meet payroll.  Eastman died in 1934, and with him went Henneberger's plans for recovering control of Weird Tales.  The magazine advertised in the early science fiction pulps, usually highlighting one of the more science-fictional stories.  Often the advertised story was by Edmond Hamilton, who was popular in the sf magazines.  Wright also sold hardcovers of books by some of his more popular authors, such as Kline, in the pages of Weird Tales.  Although the magazine was never greatly profitable, Wright was paid well.  Robert Weinberg, author of a history of Weird Tales, records a rumor that Wright was unpaid for much of his work on the magazine, but according to E. Hoffmann Price, a close friend of Wright's who occasionally read manuscripts for him, Weird Tales was paying Wright about $600 a month in 1927."

Delaney, who was the publisher of Short Stories, a successful general fiction pulp magazine based in New York.  Sprenger and Wright both received a share of the stock from Cornelius; Sprenger did not remain with the company but Wright moved to New York and stayed on as editor.  Henneberger's share of Popular Fiction Publishing was converted to a small interest in the new company, Weird Tales, Inc., a subsidiary of Delaney's Short Stories, Inc.  Dorothy McIlwraith, the editor of Short Stories, became Wright's assistant, and over the next two years Delaney tried to increase profits by adjusting the page count and price.  An increase from 144 pages to 160 pages starting with the February 1939 issue, along with the use of cheaper (and hence thicker) paper, made the magazine thicker, but this failed to increase sales.  In September 1939 the page count went down to 128, and the price was cut from 25 cents to 15 cents.  From January 1940 the frequency was reduced to bimonthly, a change which stayed in effect until the end of the magazine's run fourteen years later.  None of these changes had the intended effect, and sales continued to languish.  In March 1940, Wright left and was replaced by McIlwraith as editor; histories of the magazine differ as to whether he was fired because of poor sales, or quit because of his health\u2014he was by now suffering from Parkinson's so severely that he had trouble walking unassisted.  Wright then had an operation to reduce the pain with which he suffered, but never fully recovered.  He died in June of that year. McIlwraith's first issue was dated April 1940.  From 1945 through 1949, she was assisted by Lamont Buchanan, who worked for her as associate editor and art editor for both Weird Tales and Short Stories.  August Derleth also provided assistance and advice, although he had no formal connection with the magazine.  Most of McIlwraith's budget went to Short Stories, since that was the more successful magazine; the payment rate for fiction in Weird Tales by 1953 was one cent per word, well below the top rates of other science fiction and fantasy magazines of the day.  War shortages also caused problems, and the page count was reduced, first to 112 pages in 1943, and then to 96 pages the following year. The price was increased to 20 cents in 1947, and again to 25 cents in 1949, but it was not only Weird Tales that was suffering\u2014the entire pulp industry was in decline.  Delaney switched the format to digest with the September 1953 issue, but there was to be no reprieve.  In 1954, Weird Tales and Short Stories ceased publication; in both cases the last issue was dated September 1954. For Weird Tales, the September 1954 issue was its 279th."

        "content": "In the mid-1950s, Leo Margulies, a well-known figure in the magazine publishing world, launched a new company, Renown Publications, with plans to publish several titles.  He acquired the rights to both Weird Tales and Short Stories, and hoped to bring both magazines back.  He abandoned a plan to restart Weird Tales in 1962, using reprints from the original magazine, after being advised by Sam Moskowitz that there was little market for weird and horror fiction at the time.  Instead Margulies mined the Weird Tales backfile for four anthologies which appeared in the early 1960s: The Unexpected, The Ghoul-Keepers, Weird Tales, and Worlds of Weird.  The latter two were ghost-edited by Moskowitz, who proposed to Margulies that when the time was right to start the magazine up again, it should include reprints from obscure sources that Moskowitz had found, rather than just stories reprinted from the first incarnation of Weird Tales.  These stories would be as good as new for most readers, and the money saved could be used for an occasional new story. The new version of Weird Tales finally appeared from Renown Publications, in April 1973, edited by Moskowitz.  It had weak distribution and sales were too low for sustainability; according to Moskowitz the average sales were 18,000 copies per issue, well short of the 23,000 that would have been needed for the magazine to survive.  The fourth issue, dated Summer 1974, was the last, as Margulies closed down all his magazines except for Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine, which was the only one that was making a profit.  Mike Ashley, a science fiction magazine historian, records that Moskowitz was unwilling to continue in any case, as he was annoyed by Margulies's detailed involvement in the day-to-day editorial tasks such as editing manuscripts and writing introductions. Margulies died the following year, and his widow, Cylvia Margulies, decided to sell the rights to the title.  Forrest Ackerman, a science fiction fan and editor, was one of the interested parties, but she chose instead to sell to Victor Dricks and Robert Weinberg.  Weinberg in turn licensed the title to Lin Carter, who interested a publisher, Zebra Books, in the project.  The result was a series of four paperback anthologies, edited by Lin Carter, appearing between 1981 and 1983; these were originally planned to be quarterly, but in fact the first two both appeared in December 1980 and were both dated Spring 1981.  The next was dated Fall 1981; Carter's rights to the title were terminated by Weinberg in 1982 for non-payment, but the fourth issue was already in the works and finally appeared with a date of Summer 1983. In 1982 Sheldon Jaffery and Roy Torgeson met with Weinberg to propose taking over as licensees, but Weinberg decided not to pursue the offer.  The following year, Brian Forbes approached Weinberg with another offer. Forbes' company, the Bellerophon Network, was an imprint of a Los Angeles company named The Wizard.  Ashley reports that Weinberg was only able to contact Forbes by phone, and even that was not always reliable, so negotiations were slow.  Forbes' editorial director was Gordon Garb and the fiction editor was Gil Lamont; Forrest Ackerman also assisted, mainly by obtaining material to include.  There was a good deal of confusion between the various participants in the project: according to Locus, a science fiction trade journal, \"Ackerman says he has had no contact with publisher Forbes, does not know what will happen to the material he put together, and is as much in the dark as everybody else.  Lamont says that he is still renegotiating his contract and is not sure where he stands\". The original plan was for the first issue to appear in August 1984, dated July/August, but before it appeared the decision was taken to change the contents, and a new, completely reset issue finally appeared at the end of the year, dated Fall 1984.  Even with this delay a final agreement had not yet been reached with Weinberg over licensing.  Only 12,500 copies were printed; these were sent to two distributors who both went into bankruptcy.  As a result, few copies were sold, and Forbes was not paid by the distributors.  Despite the financial setback, Forbes attempted to continue, and a second issue eventually appeared.  Its cover date was Winter 1985 but it was not published until June 1986.  Few copies were printed; reports vary between 1,500 and 2,300 in total.  Mark Monsolo was the fiction editor, but Garb continued as editorial director; Lamont was no longer involved with the magazine."

        "content": "Weird Tales was more lastingly revived at the end of the 1980s by George H. Scithers, John Gregory Betancourt and Darrell Schweitzer, who formed Terminus Publishing, based in Philadelphia, and licensed the rights from Weinberg.  Rather than focus on newsstand distribution, which was expensive and had become less effective in the 1980s, they planned to build a base of direct subscribers and distribute the magazine for sale through specialist stores.  The first issue had a cover date of Spring 1988, but it was produced early enough to be available at the 1987 World Fantasy Convention in Nashville, Tennessee.  The size was the same as the original pulp version, though it was printed on better paper.  There were also limited edition hardcover versions of each issue, signed by the contributors.  A special World Fantasy Award Weird Tales received in 1992 made it apparent that the magazine was successful in terms of quality, but sales were insufficient to cover costs.  To save money the format was changed to a larger flat size, starting with the Winter 1992/1993 issue, but the magazine remained in financial trouble, with issues becoming irregular over the next couple of years.  The Summer 1993 issue was the last to have a hardcover edition; it was also the last, for a while, to bear the name Weird Tales, as Weinberg did not renew the license.  The magazine was retitled Worlds of Fantasy & Horror, and the volume numbering was restarted at volume 1 number 1, but in every other way the magazine was unchanged, and the four issues under this title, issued between 1994 and 1996, are regarded by bibliographers as part of the overall Weird Tales run. In April 1995, HBO announced they had plans to turn Weird Tales into a three-episode anthology show similar to their Tales from the Crypt series. The deal for the rights was facilitated by screenwriters Mark Patrick Carducci and Peter Atkins. Directors Tim Burton, Francis Ford Coppola, and Oliver Stone were executive producers, with each one expected to direct an episode.  Stone was to be director of the pilot, but the series never came to fruition. No issues appeared in 1997, but in 1998 Scithers and Schweitzer negotiated a deal with Warren Lupine of DNA Publications which allowed them to start publishing Weird Tales under license once again.  The first issue was dated Summer 1998, and, other than the omission of the Winter 1998 issue, a regular quarterly schedule was maintained for the next four and a half years.  Sales were weak, never rising above 6,000 copies, and DNA began to experience financial difficulties.  Wildside Press, owned by John Betancourt, joined DNA and Terminus Publishing as co-publisher, starting with the July/August 2003 issue, and Weird Tales returned to a mostly regular schedule for a few months.  A long hiatus ended with the December 2004 issue, which appeared in early 2005; this was the last issue under the arrangement with DNA.  Wildside Press then bought Weird Tales, and Betancourt again joined Scithers and Schweitzer as co-editor. The first Wildside Press edition appeared in September 2005, and starting with the following issue, dated February 2006, the magazine was able to stay on a more or less bimonthly schedule for some time.  In early 2007, Wildside announced a revamp of Weird Tales, naming Stephen H. Segal the editorial and creative director and later recruiting Ann VanderMeer as the new fiction editor.  In January 2010, the magazine announced Segal was leaving the top editorial post to become an editor at Quirk Books. VanderMeer was elevated to editor-in-chief, Mary Robinette Kowal joined the staff as art director and Segal became senior contributing editor. On August 23, 2011, John Betancourt announced that Wildside Press would be selling Weird Tales to Marvin Kaye and John Harlacher of Nth Dimension Media.  Marvin Kaye took over chief editorial duties. Issue 359, the first under the new publishers, was published in late February 2012. Some months before the release of issue 359, a special World Fantasy Convention preview issue was given away for free to interested attendees.  Four issues then appeared, with issue #362 published in Spring of 2014. On August 14, 2019, the official Weird Tales Facebook magazine announced the return of Weird Tales with author Jonathan Maberry as the editorial director. Issue #363 became available to purchase at the Weird Tales website."

        "title": "Weird Tales_Edwin Baird",
        "content": "Edwin Baird, the first editor of Weird Tales, was not an ideal choice for the job as he disliked horror stories; his expertise was in crime fiction, and most of the material he acquired was bland and unoriginal.  The writers Henneberger had been hoping to publish, such as Garland and Hough, failed to submit anything to Baird, and the magazine published mostly traditional ghost fiction, with many of the stories narrated by characters in lunatic asylums, or told in diary format.  The cover story for the first issue was \"Ooze\", by Anthony M. Rud; there was also the first installment of a serial, \"The Thing of A Thousand Shapes\", by Otis Adelbert Kline, and 22 other stories.  Ashley suggests that the better pulp writers from whom Baird did manage to acquire material, such as Francis Stevens and Austin Hall, were sending Baird stories which had already been rejected elsewhere. In the middle of the year Baird received five stories submitted by H. P. Lovecraft; Baird bought all five of them.  Lovecraft, who had been persuaded by friends to submit the stories, included a cover letter that was so remarkably negative about the quality of the manuscripts that Baird published it in the September 1923 issue, with a note appended saying that he had bought the stories \"despite the foregoing, or because of it\".  However, Baird insisted that the stories be resubmitted as typed double-spaced manuscripts; Lovecraft disliked typing, and initially decided to resubmit only one story, \"Dagon\".  It appeared in the October 1923 issue, which was the most noteworthy of Baird's tenure, since it included stories by three writers who would become frequent contributors to Weird Tales: as well as Lovecraft, it marked the first appearance in the magazine of Frank Owen and Seabury Quinn. Robert Weinberg, in his history of Weird Tales, agrees with Ashley that the quality of Baird's issues was poor, but comments that some good stories were published: \"it was just that the percentage of such stories was dismally small\".  Weinberg singles out \"A Square of Canvas\" by Rud, and \"Beyond the Door\" by Paul Suter as \"exceptional\"; both appeared in the April 1923 issue.  Weinberg also regards \"The Floor Above\" by M. L. Humphries and \"Penelope\" by Vincent Starrett, both from the May 1923 issue, and \"Lucifer\" by John Swain, from the November 1923 issue, as memorable, and comments that \"The Rats in the Walls\", in the March 1924 issue, was one of Lovecraft's finest stories.  It is unclear whether Baird or Henneberger was responsible for buying Lovecraft's stories; in one of Lovecraft's letters he makes it clear that Baird was keen to acquire his stories, but Henneberger has said that he overrode Baird and that Baird did not like Lovecraft's writing.  It was Henneberger who came up with another idea involving Lovecraft: Henneberger contacted Harry Houdini and made arrangements to have Lovecraft ghost-write a story for him using a plot supplied by Houdini.  The story, \"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\", appeared under Houdini's name in the May/June/July 1924 issue, though it was nearly lost\u2014Lovecraft left the typed manuscript on the train he took to New York to get married, and as a result spent much of his wedding day retyping the manuscript from the longhand copy he still had. The May/June/July 1924 issue included another story: \"The Loved Dead\", by C. M. Eddy Jr. which included a mention of necrophilia.  According to Eddy, this led to the magazine being removed from the newsstands in several cities, and beneficial publicity for the magazine, helping sales, but in his history of Weird Tales Robert Weinberg reports that he found no evidence of the magazine being banned, and the financial state of the magazine implies there was no benefit to sales either.  However, S. T. Joshi has said the magazine was indeed removed from newsstands in Indiana. The cover art during Baird's tenure was dull; Ashley calls it \"unattractive\", and Weinberg describes the color scheme of the first issue's cover as \"less than inspired\", though he considers the next month's cover to be an improvement.  He adds that from the May 1923 issue \"the covers plunged into a pit of mediocrity\".  In Weinberg's opinion the poor cover art, frequently by R. M. Mally, was probably partly to blame for the magazine's lack of success under Baird.  Weinberg also regards the interior art during the magazine's first year as very weak; most of the interior drawings were small, and with little of the atmosphere one would expect from a horror magazine.  All the illustrations were by Heitman, whom Weinberg describes as \"...\u00a0notable for his complete lack of imagination.  Heitman's specialty was taking the one scene in a frightening story that featured nothing at all frightening or weird and illustrating that\"."

        "title": "Weird Tales_Farnsworth Wright",
        "content": "The new editor, Farnsworth Wright, was much more willing than Baird had been to publish stories that did not fit into any of the existing pulp categories.  Ashley describes Wright as \"erratic\" in his selections, but under his guidance the magazine steadily improved in quality.  His first issue, November 1924, was little better than those edited by Baird, although it included two stories by new writers, Frank Belknap Long and Greye La Spina, who became popular contributors.  Over the following year, Wright established a group of writers as regulars, including Long and La Spina, and published many stories by writers who would be closely associated with the magazine for the next decade and more.  In April 1925, Nictzin Dyalhis's first story, \"When the Green Star Waned\", appeared; although Weinberg regards it as very dated, it was highly regarded at the time, with Wright listing it in 1933 as the most popular story to appear in Weird Tales.  That issue also contained the first instalment of La Spina's novel Invaders from the Dark, which Baird had rejected as \"too commonplace\".  It proved to be extremely popular with readers, and Weinberg comments that Baird's rejection was \"just one of the many mistakes made by the earlier editor\". Arthur J. Burks, who would go on to be a very successful pulp writer, appeared under both his real name and under a pseudonym, used for his first sale, in January 1925.  Robert Spencer Carr's first story appeared in March 1925; H. Warner Munn's \"The Werewolf of Ponkert\" appeared in July 1925, and in the same issue Wright printed \"Spear and Fang\", the first professional sale of Robert E. Howard, who would become famous as the creator of Conan the Barbarian.  In late 1925 Wright added a \"Weird Tales reprint\" department, which showcased old weird stories, typically horror classics.  Often these were translations, and in some cases the appearance in Weird Tales was the story's first appearance in English. Wright initially rejected Lovecraft's \"The Call of Cthulhu\", but eventually bought it, and printed it in the February 1928 issue.  This was the first tale of the Cthulhu Mythos, a fictional universe in which Lovecraft set several stories.  Over time other writers began to contribute their own stories with the same shared background, including Frank Belknap Long, August Derleth, E. Hoffmann Price, and Donald Wandrei.  Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith were friends of Lovecraft's, but did not contribute Cthulhu stories; instead Howard wrote sword and sorcery fiction, and Smith produced a series of high fantasy stories, many of which were part of his Hyperborean cycle.  Robert Bloch, later to become well known as the writer of the movie Psycho, began publishing stories in Weird Tales in 1935; he was a fan of Lovecraft's work, and asked Lovecraft's permission to include Lovecraft as a character in one of his stories, and to kill the character off.  Lovecraft gave him permission, and reciprocated by killing off a thinly disguised version of Bloch in one of his own stories not long afterward. Edmond Hamilton, a leading early writer of space opera, became a regular, and Wright also published science fiction stories by J. Schlossel and Otis Adelbert Kline.  Tennessee Williams' first sale was to Weird Tales, with a short story titled \"The Vengeance of Nitocris\". This was published in the August 1928 issue under the author's real name, Thomas Lanier Williams. Weird Tales' subtitle was \"The Unique Magazine\", and Wright's story selections were as varied as the subtitle promised; he was willing to print strange or bizarre stories with no hint  of the fantastic if they were unusual enough to fit in the magazine.  Although Wright's editorial standards were broad, and although he personally disliked the restrictions that convention placed on what he could publish, he did exercise caution when presented with material that might offend his readership.  E. Hoffmann Price records that his story \"Stranger from Kurdistan\" was held after purchase for six months before Wright printed it in the July 1925 issue; the story includes a scene in which Christ and Satan meet, and Wright was worried about the possible reader reaction.  The story nevertheless proved to be very popular, and Wright reprinted it in the December 1929 issue.  He also published \"The Infidel's Daughter\" by Price, a satire of the Ku Klux Klan, which drew an angry letter and a cancelled subscription from a Klan member.  Price later recalled Wright's response: \"a story that arouses controversy is good for circulation\u00a0... and anyway it would be worth a reasonable loss to rap bigots of that caliber\".  Wright also printed George Fielding Eliot's \"The Copper Bowl\", a story about a young woman being tortured; she dies when her torturer forces a rat to eat through her body.  Weinberg suggests that the story was so gruesome that it would have been difficult to place in a magazine even fifty years later. On several occasions Wright rejected a story of Lovecraft's only to reconsider later; de Camp suggests that Wright's rejection at the end of 1925 of Lovecraft's \"In the Vault\", a story about a mutilated corpse taking revenge on the undertaker responsible, was because it was \"too gruesome\", but Wright changed his mind a few years later, and the story eventually appeared in April 1932.  Wright also rejected Lovecraft's \"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\" in mid-1933.  Price had revised the story before passing it to Wright, and after Wright and Price discussed the story, Wright bought it, in November of that year.  Wright turned down Lovecraft's novel At the Mountains of Madness in 1935, though in this case it was probably because of the story's length\u2014running a serial required paying an author for material that would not appear until two or three issues later, and Weird Tales often had little cash to spare.  In this case he did not change his mind. Quinn was Weird Tales' most prolific author, with a long-running sequence of stories about a detective, Jules de Grandin, who investigated supernatural events, and for a while he was the most popular writer in the magazine.  Other regular contributors included Paul Ernst, David H. Keller, Greye La Spina, Hugh B. Cave, and Frank Owen, who wrote fantasies set in an imaginary version of the Far East.  C.L. Moore's  story \"Shambleau\", her first sale, appeared in Weird Tales in November 1933; Price visited the Weird Tales offices shortly after Wright read the manuscript for it, and recalls that Wright was so enthusiastic about the story that he closed the office, declaring it \"C.L. Moore day\".  The story was very well received by readers, and Moore's work, including her stories about Jirel of Joiry and Northwest Smith, appeared almost exclusively in Weird Tales over the next three years. As well as fiction, Wright printed a substantial amount of poetry, with at least one poem included in most issues.  Originally this often included reprints of poems such as Edgar Allan Poe's \"El Dorado\", but soon most of the poetry was original, with contributions coming from Lovecraft, Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith, among many others.  Lovecraft's contributions included ten of his \"Fungi from Yuggoth\" poems, a series of sonnets on weird themes that he wrote in 1930. The artwork was an important element of the magazine's personality, with Margaret Brundage, who painted many covers featuring nudes for Weird Tales, perhaps the best known artist.  Many of Brundage's covers were for stories by Seabury Quinn, and Brundage later commented that once Quinn realized that Wright always commissioned covers from Brundage that included a nude, \"he made sure that each de Grandin story had at least one sequence where the heroine shed all her clothes\".  For over three years in the early 1930s, from June 1933 to August/September 1936, Brundage was the only cover artist Weird Tales used.  Another prominent cover artist was J. Allen St. John, whose covers were more action-oriented, and who designed the title logo used from 1933 until 2007.  Hannes Bok's first professional sale was to Weird Tales, for the cover of the December 1939 issue; he became a frequent contributor over the next few years. Virgil Finlay, one of the most important figures in the history of science fiction and fantasy art, made his first sale to Wright in 1935; Wright only bought one interior illustration from Finlay at that time because he was concerned that Finlay's delicate technique would not reproduce well on pulp paper.  After a test print on pulp stock demonstrated that the reproduction was more than adequate, Wright began to buy regularly from Finlay, who became a regular cover artist for Weird Tales starting with the December 1935 issue.  Demand from readers for Finlay's artwork was so high that in 1938 Wright commissioned a series of illustrations from Finlay for lines taken from famous poems, such as \"O sweet and far, from cliff and scar/The horns of Elfland faintly blowing\", from Tennyson's \"The Princess\".  Not every artist was as successful as Brundage and Finlay: Price suggested that Curtis Senf, who painted 45 covers early in Wright's tenure, \"was one of Sprenger's bargains\", meaning that he produced poor art, but worked fast for low rates. During the 1930s, Brundage's rate for a cover painting was $90.  Finlay received $100 for his first cover, which appeared in 1937, over a year after his first interior illustrations were used; Weinberg suggests that the higher fee was partly to cover postage, since Brundage lived in Chicago and delivered her artwork in person, but it was also because Brundage's popularity was beginning to decline.  When Delaney acquired the magazine in late 1938, the fee for a cover painting was cut to $50, and in Weinberg's opinion the quality of the artwork declined immediately.  Nudes no longer appeared, though it is not known if this was a deliberate policy on Delaney's part.  In 1939 a campaign by Fiorello LaGuardia, the mayor of New York, to eliminate sex from the pulps led to milder covers, and this may also have had an effect. In 1936, Howard committed suicide, and the following year Lovecraft died.  There was so much unpublished work by Lovecraft  that Wright was able to use that he printed more material under Lovecraft's byline after his death than before.  In Howard's case, there was no such trove of stories available, but other writers such as Henry Kuttner provided similar material.  By the end of Wright's tenure as editor, many of the writers who had become strongly associated with the magazine were gone; Kuttner, and others such as Price and Moore, were still writing, but Weird Tales''' rates were too low to attract submissions from them.  Clark Ashton Smith had stopped writing, and two other writers who were well-liked, G.G. Pendarves and Henry Whitehead, had died. Except for a couple of short-lived magazines such as Strange Tales and Tales of Magic and Mystery, and a weak challenge from Ghost Stories, all between the late 1920s and the early 1930s, Weird Tales had little competition for most of Wright's sixteen years as editor.  In the early 1930s, a series of pulp magazines began to appear that became known as \"weird menace\" magazines.  These lasted until the end of the decade, but despite the name there was little overlap in subject matter between them and Weird Tales: the stories in the weird menace magazines appeared to be based on occult or supernatural events, but at the end of the tale the mystery was always revealed to have a logical explanation.  In 1935 Wright began running weird detective stories to try to attract some of the readers of these magazines to Weird Tales, and asked readers to write in with comments. Reader reaction was uniformly negative, and after a year he announced that there would be no more of them. In 1939 two more serious threats appeared, both launched to compete directly for Weird Tales' readers.   Strange Stories appeared in February 1939 and lasted for just over two years; Weinberg describes it as \"top-quality\", though Ashley is less complimentary, describing it as largely unoriginal and imitative. The following month the first issue of Unknown appeared from Street & Smith.  Fritz Leiber submitted several of his \"Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser\" stories to Wright, but Wright rejected all of them (as did McIlwraith when she took over the editorship).  Leiber subsequently sold them all to John W. Campbell for Unknown; Campbell commented each time to Leiber that \"these would be better in Weird Tales\".  The stories grew into a very popular sword and sorcery series, but none of them ever appeared in Weird Tales.  Leiber did eventually sell several stories to Weird Tales, beginning with \"The Automatic Pistol\", which appeared in May 1940.Jaffery & Cook (1985), p. 104.Weird Tales included a letters column, titled \"The Eyrie\", for most of its existence, and during Wright's time as editor it was usually filled with long and detailed letters.  When Brundage's nude covers appeared, a lengthy debate over whether they were suitable for the magazine was fought out in the Eyrie, with the two sides divided about equally.  For years it was the most discussed topic in the magazine's letter column.  Many of the authors Wright published wrote letters too, including Lovecraft, Howard, Kuttner, Bloch, Smith, Quinn,  Wellman, Price, and Wandrei. In most cases these letters praised the magazine, but occasionally a critical comment was raised, as when Bloch repeatedly expressed his dislike for Howard's stories of Conan the Barbarian, referring to him as \"Conan the Cimmerian Chipmunk\".  Another debate that was aired in the letter column was the question of how much science fiction the magazine should include.  Until Amazing Stories was launched in April 1926, science fiction was popular with Weird Tales' readers, but after that point letters began to appear asking Wright to exclude science fiction, and only publish weird fantasy and horror.  The pro-science fiction readers were in the majority, and as Wright agreed with them, he continued to include science fiction in Weird Tales.  Hugh B. Cave, who sold half-a-dozen stories to Wright in the early 1930s, commented on \"The Eyrie\" in a letter to a fellow writer: \"No other magazine makes such a point of discussing past stories, and letting the authors know how their stuff is received\"."

        "doc_id": "407_20667",
        "title": "Weird Tales_Dorothy McIlwraith",
        "content": "McIlwraith was an experienced magazine editor, but she knew little about weird fiction, and unlike Wright she also had to face real competition from other magazines for Weird Tales' core readership.  Although Unknown folded in 1943, in its four years of existence it transformed the field of fantasy and horror, and Weird Tales was no longer regarded as the leader in its field.  Unknown published many successful humorous fantasy stories, and McIlwraith responded by including some humorous material, but Weird Tales rates were less than Unknown, with predictable effects on quality.  In 1940 the policy of reprinting horror and weird classics ceased, and Weird Tales began using the slogan \"All Stories New \u2013 No Reprints\".  Weinberg suggests that this was a mistake, as Weird Tales readership appreciated getting access to classic stories \"often mentioned but rarely found\".  Without the reprints Weird Tales was left to survive on the rejects from Unknown, with the same authors selling to both markets.  In Weinberg's words, \"only the quality of the stories [separated] their work between the two pulps\". Delaney's personal taste also reduced McIlwraith's latitude.  In an interview with Robert A. Lowndes in early 1940, Delaney spoke about his plans for Weird Tales.  After saying that the magazine would still publish \"all types of weird and fantasy fiction\", Lowndes reported that Delaney did not want \"stories which center about sheer repulsiveness, stories which leave an impression not to be described by any other word than 'nasty.  Lowndes later added that Delaney had told him he found some of Clark Ashton Smith's stories on the \"disgusting side\". McIlwraith continued to publish many of Weird Tales' most popular authors, including Quinn, Derleth, Hamilton, Bloch, and Manly Wade Wellman.  She also added new contributors; as well as publishing many of Ray Bradbury's early stories, Weird Tales regularly featured Fredric Brown, Mary Elizabeth Counselman, Fritz Leiber, and Theodore Sturgeon.  As Wright had done, McIlwraith continued to buy Lovecraft stories submitted by August Derleth, though she abridged some of the longer pieces, such as \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\".  Sword and sorcery stories, a genre which Howard had made much more popular with his stories of Conan, Solomon Kane and Bran Mak Morn in Weird Tales in the early 1930s, had continued to appear under Farnsworth Wright; they all but disappeared during McIlwraith's tenure.  McIlwraith also focused more on short fiction, and serials and long stories were rare.Clute (1997), pp. 481\u2013482. In May 1951 Weird Tales once again began to include reprints, in an attempt to reduce costs, but by that time the earlier issues of Weird Tales had been extensively mined for reprints by August Derleth's publishing venture, Arkham House, and as a result McIlwraith often reprinted lesser-known stories.  They were not advertised as reprints, which led in a couple of cases to letters from readers asking for more stories from H. P. Lovecraft, whom they believed to be a new author. In Weinberg's opinion, the magazine lost variety under McIlwraith's editorship, and \"much of the uniqueness of the magazine was gone\".  In Ashley's view, the magazine became more consistent in quality, rather than worse; Ashley comments that though the issues edited by McIlwraith \"seldom attain[ed] Wright's highpoints, they also omitted the lows\".  L. Sprague de Camp, toward the end of McIlwraith's time as editor, agreed that the 1930s were the magazine's heyday, citing Wright's death and the departure for other, better-paying, markets of several of its contributors as factors in the magazine's decline. The quality of Weird Tales artwork suffered when Delaney cut the rates.  Bok, whose first cover had appeared in December 1939, moved to New York and joined the office art staff for a while; he eventually left because of the low pay.  Boris Dolgov began contributing in the 1940s; he was a friend of Bok's and the two occasionally collaborated, signing the result \"Dolbokgov\".  Weinberg regards Dolgov's illustration for Robert Bloch's \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" as one of his best works.  Weird Tales paper was of very poor quality, which meant that the reproductions were poor, and along with the low pay rate for art this meant that many artists treated Weird Tales as a last resort for their work.  Damon Knight, who sold some interior artwork to Weird Tales in the early 1940s, recalled later that he was paid $5 for a single-page drawing, and $10 for a double-page spread; he worked slowly and the low pay meant Weird Tales was not a viable market for him. The art editor, Lamont Buchanan, was able to establish five artists as regulars by the mid-1940s; they remained regular contributors until 1954, when the magazine's first incarnation ceased publication.  The five were Dolgov, John Giunta, Fred Humiston, Vincent Napoli, and Lee Brown Coye.  In Weinberg's review of Weird Tales interior art, he describes Humiston's work as ranging \"from bad to terrible\", but he is more positive about the others.  Napoli had worked for Weird Tales from 1932 to the mid-1930s, when he began selling to the science fiction pulps, but his work for Short Stories brought him back to Weird Tales in the 1940s.  Weinberg speaks highly of both Napoli and Coye, whom Weinberg describes as \"the master of the weird and grotesque illustration\".  Coye did a series of full-page illustrations for Weird Tales called \"Weirdisms\", which ran intermittently from November 1948 to July 1951.Weinberg (1999d), pp. 86\u201388. The letter column, \"The Eyrie\", was much reduced in size during McIlwraith's tenure, but as a gesture to the readers a \"Weird Tales Club\" was started.  Joining the Club simply meant writing in to receive a free membership card; the only other benefit was that the magazine listed all the members' names and addresses, so that members could contact each other.  Among the names listed in the January 1943 issue was that of Hugh Hefner, later to become famous as the founder of Playboy. Toward the end of McIlwraith's time as editor a couple of new writers appeared, including Richard Matheson and Joseph Payne Brennan.  Brennan had already sold over a dozen stories to other pulps when he finally made a sale to McIlwraith, but he had always wanted to sell to Weird Tales, and three years after the magazine folded he launched a small-press horror magazine named Macabre, which he published for some years, in imitation of Weird Tales."

        "content": "The four issues edited by Sam Moskowitz in the early 1970s included a detailed biography of William Hope Hodgson, serialized over three issues, along with some rare stories of Hodgson's that Moskowitz had unearthed.  Many of the other stories were reprints, either from Weird Tales or from other early pulps such as The Black Cat or Blue Book.  In Ashley's opinion, the magazine \"had the feel of a museum piece with nothing new or progressive\", though Weinberg describes the magazine as having \"an interesting jumble of contents\".  The subsequent paperback series edited by Lin Carter was criticized in similar terms: Weinberg regards it as having \"too much reliance\u00a0... on the old names like Lovecraft, Howard and Smith by reprinting mediocre material\u00a0... New writers were not sufficiently encouraged\", though Weinberg does add that Ramsey Campbell, Tanith Lee and Steve Rasnic Tem were among the newer writers who contributed good material.  Ashley's opinion of the two Bellerophon issues is low: he describes them as lacking \"any clear editorial direction or acumen\"."

During this time Weird Tales published works by a wide range of strange-fiction authors including Michael Moorcock and Tanith Lee, as well as newer writers such as  N. K. Jemisin, Jay Lake, Cat Rambo, and Rachel Swirsky.  This period also saw the addition of a broader range of content, ranging from narrative essays to comics to features on weird culture.  The magazine won its first Hugo Award in August 2009, in the semiprozine category, along with receiving two Hugo Award nominations in subsequent years and its first World Fantasy Award nomination, for Segal and Vandermeer, in more than seventeen years. In addition to winning or being nominated for awards, under VanderMeer's editorship Weird Tales saw the number of subscriptions triple as the magazine \"came to symbolise what was good about the changes in the SF community."

        "content": "in 2011 Marvin Kaye and John Harlacher purchased Weird Tales from John Gregory Betancourt with Kaye taking over chief editorial duties from VanderMeer. Issue 359, the first under the new publishers, was published in late February 2012. Some months before the release of issue 359, a special World Fantasy Convention preview issue was given away for free to interested attendees. In August 2012, Weird Tales became involved in a media altercation after Kaye announced the magazine was going to publish an excerpt from Victoria Foyt's controversial novel Save the Pearls, which many critics accused of featuring racist stereotyping. The decision was made despite the protests of VanderMeer, and prompted her to end her association with the magazine. Kaye wrote an essay titled \"A Thoroughly NONRACIST Novel\" defending his decision to publish the excerpt. However, both the essay and Kaye's decision to publish the excerpt were heavily criticized, with N. K. Jemisin saying \"This is how you destroy something beautiful\" with regards to the magazine and Jim C. Hines saying he was \"highly disturbed that the editor ever thought this was in any way a good idea, that he was so supportive of this novel that he was going out of his way to defend and support it \u2026 up until the Internet landed on his head.\" The publisher subsequently overruled Kaye and announced that Weird Tales no longer had plans to run the excerpt. After the fall 2012 issue #360, Kaye only published two more issues of Weird Tales, issue #361 in the summer of 2013 and #362 in the spring of 2014. In 2019 Weird Tales returned with author Jonathan Maberry as the editorial director, with issue #363 being released at the end of that year. This issue featured the story \"Up from Slavery\" by Victor LaValle, which later won the Stoker Award for Best Long Fiction.\"The 2019 Bram Stoker Award finalists ,\" Bram Stoker Website, accessed March 28, 2021. Legacy Weird Tales was one of the most important magazines in the fantasy field; in Ashley's view, it is \"second only to Unknown in significance and influence\".  Weinberg goes further, calling it \"the most important and influential of all fantasy magazines\".  Weinberg argues that much of the material Weird Tales published would never have appeared if the magazine had not existed.  It was through Weird Tales that Lovecraft, Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith became widely known, and it was the first and one of the most important markets for weird and science fantasy artwork.  Many of the horror stories adapted for early radio shows such as Stay Tuned for Terror originally appeared in Weird Tales.  The magazine's \"Golden Age\" was under Wright, and de Camp argues that one of Wright's accomplishments was to create a \"Weird Tales school of writing\".  Justin Everett and Jeffrey H. Shanks, the editors of a recent scholarly collection of literary criticism focused on the magazine, argue that \"Weird Tales functioned as a nexus point in the development of speculative fiction from which emerged the modern genres of fantasy and horror\". The magazine was, unusually for a pulp, included by the editors of the annual Year in Fiction anthologies, and was generally regarded with more respect than most of the pulps.  This remained true long after the magazine's first run ended, as it became the main source of fantasy short stories for anthologists for several decades.  Weinberg argues that the fantasy pulps, of which, in his opinion, Weird Tales was the most influential, helped to form the modern fantasy genre, and that Wright, \"if he was not a perfect editor\u00a0... was an extraordinary one, and one of the most influential figures in modern American fantasy fiction\", adding that Weird Tales and its competitors \"served as the bedrock upon which much of modern fantasy rests\".  Everett and Shanks agree, and regard Weird Tales as the venue where writers, editors and an engaged readership \"elevated speculated fiction to new heights\" with influence that \"reverberates through modern popular culture\".  In Ashley's words, \"somewhere in the imagination reservoir of all U.S.  (and many non-U.S.) genre-fantasy and horror writers is part of the spirit of Weird Tales\"."

        "content": "The publisher for the first year was Rural Publishing Corporation; this changed to Popular Fiction Publishing with the November 1924 issue, and to Weird Tales, Inc. with the December 1938 issue.  The four issues in the early 1970s came from Renown Publications, and the four paperbacks in the early 1980s were published by Zebra Books.  The next two issues were from Bellerophon, and then from Spring 1988 to Winter 1996 the publisher was Terminus.  From Summer 1998 to July/August 2003 the publisher was DNA Publications and Terminus, listed either as DNA Publications/Terminus or just as DNA Publications.  The September/October 2003 issue listed the publisher as DNA Publications/Wildside Press/Terminus, and through 2004 this remained the case, with one issue dropping Terminus from the masthead.  Thereafter Wildside Press was the publisher, sometimes with Terminus listed as well, until the September/October 2007 issue, after which only Wildside Press were listed.  The issues published from 2012 through 2014 were from Nth Dimension Media.Weird Tales was in pulp format for its entire first run except for the issues from May 1923 to April 1924, when it was a large pulp, and the last year, from September 1953 to September 1954, when it was a digest.  The four 1970s issues were in pulp format.  The two Bellerophon issues were quarto.  The Terminus issues reverted to pulp format until the Winter 1992/1993 issue, which was large pulp.  A single pulp issue appeared in Fall 1998, and then the format returned to large pulp until the Fall 2000 issue, which was quarto.  The format varied between large pulp and quarto until January 2006, which was large pulp, as were all issues after that date until Fall 2009, except for a quarto-sized November 2008.  From Summer 2010 the format was quarto. The first run of the magazine was priced at 25 cents for the first fifteen years of its life except for the oversized May/June/July 1924 issue, which was 50 cents.  In September 1939 the price was reduced to 15 cents, where it stayed until the September 1947 issue, which was 20 cents.  The price went up again to 25 cents in May 1949; the digest-sized issues from September 1953 to September 1954 were 35 cents.  The first three paperbacks edited by Lin Carter were priced at $2.50; the fourth was $2.95.  The two Bellerophon issues were $2.50 and $2.95.  The Terminus Weird Tales began in Spring 1988 priced at $3.50; this went up to $4.00 with the Fall 1988 issue, and to $4.95 with the Summer 1990 issue.  The next price increase was to $5.95, in Spring 2003, and then to $6.99 with the January 2008 issue.  The first two issues from Nth Dimension Media were priced at $7.95 and $6.99; the last two were $9.99 each. Some of the early Terminus editions of Weird Tales were also printed in hardcover format, in limited editions of 200 copies.  These were signed by the contributors, and were available at $40 as part of a subscription offer.  Issues produced in this format include Summer 1988, Spring/Fall 1989, Winter 1989/1990, Spring 1991, and Winter 1991/1992."

        "title": "Weird Tales_Canadian and British editions",
        "content": "A Canadian edition of Weird Tales appeared from June 1935 to July 1936; all fourteen issues are thought to be identical to the U.S. issues of those dates, though \"Printed in Canada\" appeared on the cover, and in at least one case another text box was placed on the cover to conceal part of a nude figure.  Another Canadian series began in 1942, as a result of import restrictions placed on U.S. magazines.  Canadian editions from 1942 up to January 1948 were not identical to the U.S. editions, but they match closely enough that the originals are easily identified.  From the May 1942 to January 1945 issues, they correspond to the U.S. editions two issues earlier, that is, from January 1942 to September 1944.  There was no Canadian issue corresponding to the November 1944 U.S. issue, so from that point the Canadian issues were only one behind the U.S. ones: the issues from March 1945 to January 1948 correspond to the U.S. issues from January 1945 to November 1947.  There was no Canadian issue of the January 1948 U.S. issue, and from the next issue, March 1948, till the end of the Canadian run in November 1951, the issues were identical to the U.S. versions. There were numerous differences between the Canadian issues from May 1942 to January 1948 and the corresponding U.S. issues.  All the covers were repainted by Canadian artists until the January 1945 issue; thereafter the artwork from the original issues was used.  Initially the fiction content of the Canadian issues was unchanged from the U.S., but starting in September 1942 the Canadian Weird Tales dropped some of the original stories in each issue, replacing them with either stories from other issues of Weird Tales, or, occasionally, material from Short Stories. In a couple of instances a story appeared in the Canadian edition of the magazine before its appearance in the U.S. version, or simultaneously with it, so it is evident that whoever assembled the issues had access to the Weird Tales pending story file.  Because of the reorganization of material, it often happened that one of the Canadian issues would have more than a single story by the same author.  In these cases a pseudonym was invented for one of the stories. There were four separate editions of Weird Tales distributed in the United Kingdom.  In early 1942, three issues abridged from the September 1940, November 1940, and January 1941 U.S. issues were published in the U.K. by Gerald Swan; they were undated, and had no volume numbers.  The middle issue was 64 pages long; the other two were 48 pages.  All were priced at 6d.  A single issue was released in late 1946 by William Merrett; it also was undated and unnumbered.  It was 36 pages long, and was priced at 1/6.  The three stories included came from the October 1937 U.S. issue. A longer run of 23 issues appeared between November 1949 and December 1953, from Thorpe & Porter.  These were all undated; the first issue had no volume or issue number but subsequent issues were numbered sequentially.  Most were priced at 1/-; issues 11 to 15 were 1/6.  All were 96 pages long.  The first issue corresponds to the July 1949 U.S. issue; the next 20 issues correspond to the U.S. issues from November 1949 to January 1953, and the final two issues correspond to May 1953 and March 1953, in that order.  Another five bimonthly issues appeared from Thorpe & Porter dated November 1953  to July 1954, with the volume numbering restarted at volume 1 number 1.  These correspond to the U.S. issues from September 1953 to May 1954. Collectability Weird Tales is widely collected, and many issues command very high prices.  In 2008, Mike Ashley estimated the first issue to be worth \u00a33,000 in excellent condition, and added that the second issue is much rarer and commands higher prices.  Issues with stories by Lovecraft or Howard are very highly sought-after, with the October 1923 issue, containing \"Dagon\", Lovecraft's first appearance in Weird Tales, fetching comparable prices to the first two issues.  The first few volumes are so rare that very few academic collections have more than a handful of these issues: Eastern New Mexico University, the holder of a remarkably complete early science fiction archive, has \"only a few scattered issues\" from the early years, and the librarian recorded in 1983 that \"dealers laugh when Eastern enquires about these\". Prices of the magazine drop over the succeeding decades, with the McIlwraith issues worth far less than the ones edited by Wright.  Ashley quotes the digest-sized issues from the end of McIlwraith's tenure as fetching \u00a38 to \u00a310 each as of 2008.  The revived editions are not particularly scarce, with two exceptions. The two Bellerophon issues received such poor distribution that they fetch high prices: Ashley quotes a 2008 price of \u00a340 to \u00a350 for the first one, and twice that for the second one.  The other valuable recent issues are the hardback versions of the Terminus Weird Tales; Ashley gives prices of between \u00a340 and  \u00a390, with some of the special author issues fetching a premium."

The band members have often expressed disappointment over the album, going so far as to re-record two songs during a brief, unsuccessful reunion in 1986. Drummer Stewart Copeland said about the time pressures: \"We had bitten off more than we could chew.\u00a0... we finished the album at 4 a.m. on the day we were starting our next world tour. We went to bed for a few hours and then traveled down to Belgium for the first gig. It was cutting it very fine.\" The band had wanted to record the album at Surrey Sound, the recording site of their first two albums, but could not record at any British studio for tax reasons. They were, however, able to retain Nigel Gray as their co-producer, bringing him with them to Wisseloord Studios in the Netherlands. Feeling that he had played a significant part in the Police's first two albums, Gray negotiated for a \u00a325,000 fee, which brought the album's total budget to \u00a335,000 (more than twice the combined budgets of their first two albums, but still exceptionally cheap for a band who at that point had become established stars).

The record has two instrumentals, \"The Other Way of Stopping\" (named from a line in Bob Newhart's \"The Driving Instructor\" routine) and \"Behind My Camel\". \"Behind My Camel\" was guitarist Andy Summers' first entirely self-penned composition. As bassist and vocalist Sting refused to play on it, Summers recorded the bass line himself, overdubbing the guitar parts. According to Sting, \"I hated that song so much that, one day when I was in the studio, I found the tape lying on the table. So I took it around the back of the studio and actually buried it in the garden.\" Nigel Gray believed that the title was an in-joke by Summers: \"He didn't tell me this himself but I'm 98% sure the reason is this: what would you find behind a camel? A monumental pile of shit.\" \"Bombs Away\" was recorded on a tape that Nigel Gray had just used with Siouxsie and the Banshees. Copeland said that \"when he first set up his home studio he got hold of a load of second hand tape which included some stuff by Siouxsie and the Banshees. 'Bombs Away' was written on a Siouxsie and the Banshees backing track. I changed the speed and did things to the EQ to change the drum pattern. So with the desk I can get my song playing, then press a switch and there's Siouxsie singing away.\" Zenyatta Mondatta also saw the band's lyrics turning towards political events, with Sting's \"Driven to Tears\" commenting on poverty and Copeland's \"Bombs Away\" referring to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. These themes became more prevalent on the Police's next album, Ghost in the Machine."

Phil Sutcliffe of Sounds wrote that he initially viewed the album as inferior to the band's earlier material, but came to recognise its strength, despite still finding it somewhat unadventurous: \"By word and note it's as articulate and literate as you might hope. It avoids a whole catalogue of megastar pitfalls. Zenyatta is not pretentious, not bombastic, not lazy.\" In Smash Hits, David Hepworth opined that Sting had particularly improved as a vocalist and songwriter, describing his compositions as \"tougher, more concerned, but no less melodic.\" Zenyatta Mondatta was voted the 28th best album of 1980 in The Village Voices year-end Pazz & Jop critics' poll. At the Grammy Awards in 1982, \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" won for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, while \"Behind My Camel\" won for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, marking the Police's second consecutive win in the latter category. Retrospectively, AllMusic critic Greg Prato cited Zenyatta Mondatta as \"arguably the best Police album\" and \"one of the finest rock albums of all time.\" In 2004's The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, J. D. Considine highlighted the more pronounced groove of the music: \"The emphasis on rhythmic intensity made the songs catchier (as 'Voices Inside My Head' shows, the band certainly knew how to work a vamp), and the rhythmic dynamics add a singular punch to the material.\" The singer Bilal names it among his 25 favourite albums, citing its fusion of rock, reggae, and dub music."

        "content": "Walker is an English and German surname derived from either a worker who cleanses wool through fulling, from the Middle High German walker, meaning \"a fuller of cloth\", or an officer whose duty consisted of walking or inspecting a certain part of a forest. The surname \"Walker\" was first found in Germany where records of the name date back to the thirteenth century.

The album is widely regarded as the first album in the heavy metal genre. Additionally, the opening track, the self-titled \"Black Sabbath\", has been referred to as the first doom metal song.

        "content": "According to Black Sabbath's guitarist and founding member Tony Iommi, the group's debut album was recorded in a single day on 16 October 1969. The session lasted twelve hours. Iommi said: \"We just went in the studio and did it in a day, we played our live set and that was it. We actually thought a whole day was quite a long time, then off we went the next day to play for \u00a320 in Switzerland.\" Aside from the bells, thunder and rain sound effects added to the beginning of the opening track and the double-tracked guitar solos on \"N.I.B.\" and \"Sleeping Village\", there were virtually no overdubs added to the album. Iommi recalls recording live: \"We thought, 'We have two days to do it and one of the days is mixing.' So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time, we just put him in a separate booth and off we went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff.\" The key to the band's new sound on the album was Iommi's distinctive playing style that he developed after an accident at a sheet metal factory where he was working at the age of 17 in which the tips of the middle fingers of his fretting hand were severed. Iommi created a pair of false fingertips using plastic from a dish detergent bottle and detuned the strings on his guitar to make it easier for him to bend the strings, creating a massive, heavy sound. \"I'd play a load of chords and I'd have to play fifths because I couldn't play fourths because of my fingers,\" Iommi explained to Phil Alexander in Mojo in 2013. \"That helped me develop my style of playing, bending the strings and hitting the open string at the same time just to make the sound wilder.\" In the same article bassist Geezer Butler added, \"Back then the bass player was supposed to do all these melodic runs, but I didn't know how to do that because I'd been a guitarist, so all I did was follow Tony's riff. That made the sound heavier.\" Iommi began recording the album with a white Fender Stratocaster, his guitar of choice at the time, but a malfunctioning pickup forced him to finish recording with a Gibson SG, a guitar he had recently purchased as a backup but had \"never really played\". The SG was a right-handed model which the left-handed Iommi played upside down. Soon after recording the album, he met a right-handed guitarist who was playing a left-handed SG upside down, and the two agreed to swap guitars; this is the SG that Iommi modified and later \"put out to pasture\" at the Hard Rock Cafe. Black Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne has always spoken fondly of the recording of the band's debut album, stating in his autobiography I Am Ozzy, \"Once we'd finished, we spent a couple of hours double-tracking some of the guitar and vocals, and that was that. Done. We were in the pub in time for last orders. It can't have taken any longer than twelve hours in total. That's how albums should be made, in my opinion.\" Drummer Bill Ward agrees, telling Guitar World in 2001, \"I think the first album is just absolutely incredible. It's na\u00efve, and there's an absolute sense of unity \u2013 it's not contrived in any way, shape or form. We weren't old enough to be clever. I love it all, including the mistakes!\" In an interview for the Classic Albums series in 2010 Butler added, \"It was literally live in the studio. I mean, (producer) Rodger Bain, I think he's a genius the way he captured the band in such a short time.\" In his autobiography Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven & Hell with Black Sabbath, Iommi plays down the producer's role, insisting, \"We didn't choose to work with Rodger Bain, he was chosen for us... He was good to have around, but we didn't really get a lot of advice from him. He maybe suggested a couple of things, but the songs were already fairly structured and sorted.\""

        "content": "On release, a writer for The Boston Globe described the music of Black Sabbath as \"hard blues-rock\". In retrospect, AllMusic's Steve Huey feels that Black Sabbath marks \"the birth of heavy metal as we now know it\". In his opinion, the album \"transcends its clear roots in blues-rock and psychedelia to become something more\". He ascribes its \"sonic ugliness\" as a reflection of \"the bleak industrial nightmare\" of the group's hometown, Birmingham, England. Huey notes the first side's allusions to themes characteristic of heavy metal, including evil, paganism, and the occult, \"as filtered through horror films and the writings of J.\u00a0R.\u00a0R. Tolkien, H.\u00a0P. Lovecraft, and Dennis Wheatley.\" He characterises side two as \"given over to loose blues-rock jamming learned through\" the English rock band Cream. In the opinion of the author and former Metal Maniacs magazine editor Jeff Wagner, Black Sabbath is the \"generally accepted starting point\" when heavy metal \"became distinct from rock and roll\". In his opinion, the album represented a transition from blues rock into \"something uglier\", and that this sound \"found deeper gravity via mournful singing and a sinister rhythmic pulse\". According to Rolling Stone magazine, \"the album that arguably invented heavy metal was built on thunderous blues-rock\". Sputnikmusic's Mike Stagno notes that Black Sabbath's combined elements of rock, jazz and blues, with heavy distortion created one of the most influential albums in the history of heavy metal. In retrospect, Black Sabbath has been lauded as perhaps the first true heavy metal album. It has also been credited as the first record in the stoner rock and goth genres. Taking a broader perspective, Pete Prown of Vintage Guitar says, \"The debut Black Sabbath album of 1970 was a watershed moment in heavy rock, but it was part of a larger trend of artists, producers, and engineers already moving towards the sound we now call hard rock and heavy metal.\""

        "content": "Black Sabbath music and lyrics were quite dark for the time. The opening track is based almost entirely on a tritone interval played at slow tempo on the electric guitar.  In the 2010 Classic Albums documentary on the making of the band's second album Paranoid, Geezer Butler claims the riff was inspired by \"Mars, the Bringer of War\", a movement in Gustav Holst's The Planets. Iommi reinterpreted the riff slightly and redefined the band's direction. Ward told Classic Albums, \"When Oz sang 'What is this that stands before me?' it became completely different...this was a different lyric now, this was a different feel. I was playing drums to the words.\" The song's lyrics concern a \"figure in black\" which bassist Geezer Butler claims to have seen after waking up from a nightmare. In the liner notes to the band's 1998 live album Reunion the bassist remembers: Similarly, the lyrics of the song \"N.I.B.\" are written from the point of view of Lucifer, who falls in love with a human woman and \"becomes a better person\" according to lyricist Butler. Contrary to popular belief, the name of that song is not an abbreviation for Nativity in Black; according to Osbourne's autobiography it is merely a reference to drummer Bill Ward's pointed goatee at the time, which was shaped as a pen-nib. The lyrics of two other songs on the album were written about stories with mythological themes. \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\" is a reference to the H. P. Lovecraft short story Beyond the Wall of Sleep, while \"The Wizard\" was inspired by the character of Gandalf from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The latter includes harmonica performed by Osbourne. The band also recorded a cover of \"Evil Woman\", a song that had been an American hit for the band Crow. In his autobiography, Iommi admits the band reluctantly agreed to do the song at the behest of their manager Jim Simpson, who insisted they record something commercial."

        "content": "The cover photograph was shot at Mapledurham Watermill, situated on the River Thames in Oxfordshire, England, by photographer Keith McMillan (credited as Keef), who was in charge of the overall design. Standing in front of the watermill is a figure dressed in a black cloak, portrayed by model Louisa Livingstone, whose identity was not widely known until 2020. \"I'm sure (McMillan) said it was for Black Sabbath, but I don't know if that meant anything much to me at the time,\" Livingstone recalled, adding that it had been \"freezing cold\" during the shoot. \"I had to get up at about 4 o'clock in the morning. Keith was rushing around with dry ice, throwing it into the water. It didn't seem to be working very well, so he ended up using a smoke machine,\" said the model. According to McMillan, Livingstone was wearing nothing underneath the black cloak, and some experimentation was done involving some \"slightly more risqu\u00e9\" photographs taken at the session. \"We decided none of that worked,\" McMillan said. \"Any kind of sexuality took away from the more foreboding mood. But she was a terrific model. She had amazing courage and understanding of what I was trying to do.\" The inner gatefold sleeve of the original release featured an inverted cross containing a poem written by Roger Brown. The band were reportedly upset when they discovered this, as it fuelled allegations that they were satanists or occultists; however, in Osbourne's memoirs, he says that to the best of his knowledge nobody was upset with the inclusion. Iommi's recollection is somewhat different: \"Suddenly we had all these crazy people turning up at shows,\" he told Mojo magazine in 2013. \"I think Alex Sanders (high priest of the Wiccan religion) turned up at a gig once. It was all quite strange, really.\" The liner notes to the 1998 Reunion album state \"Unbeknownst to the band, Black Sabbath was launched in the U.S. with a party with the head of the Church of Satan, Anton Lavey, presiding over the proceedings... All of a sudden Sabbath were Satan's Right Hand Men.\" In the years since the iconic cover photo was shot, Livingstone has released electronic music under the name Indreba."

In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), the journalist Scott Seward highlighted Bain's grandiose production on \"an album that eats hippies for breakfast.\" In the opinion of Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic, \"both fans of blues influenced hard rock and heavy metal of all sorts should find something they like on the album.\" BBC Music's Pete Marsh referred to Black Sabbath as an \"album that changed the face of rock music.\" In Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler reflects, \"The London press absolutely hated us when we made it 'cos they'd never written an article about us, they didn't know of us.

        "content": "Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications, under the ownership of S.I. Newhouse, announced in June 1981 that it was reviving the magazine. The first issue was released in February 1983 (cover date March), edited by Richard Locke, formerly of The New York Times Book Review. After three issues, Locke was replaced by Leo Lerman, veteran features editor of Vogue. He was followed by editors Tina Brown (1984\u20131992), Graydon Carter (1992-2017) and Radhika Jones (2017 to present). Regular writers and columnists have included Dominick Dunne, Sebastian Junger, Michael Wolff, Maureen Orth and Christopher Hitchens. Famous contributing photographers for the magazine include Bruce Weber, Annie Leibovitz, Mario Testino and Herb Ritts, who have all provided the magazine with a string of lavish covers and full-page portraits of current celebrities. Amongst the most famous of these was the August 1991 Leibovitz cover featuring a naked, pregnant Demi Moore, an image entitled More Demi Moore that to this day holds a spot in pop culture. In addition to its controversial photography, the magazine also prints articles on a variety of topics. In 1996, journalist Marie Brenner wrote an expos\u00e9 on the tobacco industry titled \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\". The article was later adapted into a movie The Insider (1999), which starred Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Most famously, after more than thirty years of mystery, an article in the May 2005 edition revealed the identity of Deep Throat (W. Mark Felt), one of the sources for The Washington Post articles on Watergate, which led to the 1974 resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon. The magazine also features candid interviews with celebrities, including a monthly Proust Questionnaire. Other notable interviews have included: Teri Hatcher, who revealed in the magazine that she was sexually abused as a child; Jennifer Aniston's first interview after her divorce from Brad Pitt; Anderson Cooper, who talked about his brother's death; and Martha Stewart's first interview after her release from prison. Some of the pictorials in Vanity Fair have attracted criticism. The April 1999 issue featured an image of actor Mike Myers dressed as a Hindu deity for a photo spread by David LaChapelle: after criticism, both the photographer and the magazine apologized. The magazine was the subject of Toby Young's book, How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, about his search for success in New York City while working for Graydon Carter's Vanity Fair. The book was made into a movie in 2008, with Jeff Bridges playing Carter. In 2005, Vanity Fair was found liable in a lawsuit brought in the UK by film director Roman Polanski, who claimed the magazine had libelled him in an article by A. E. Hotchner published in 2002. The article recounted a claim by Lewis H. Lapham, editor of Harper's, that Polanski had made sexual advances towards a young model as he was traveling to the funeral of his wife, Sharon Tate, in August 1969, claiming that he could make her \"the next Sharon Tate\". The court permitted Polanski to testify via a video link, after he expressed fears that he might be extradited were he to enter the United Kingdom. The trial started on July 18, 2005, and Polanski made English legal history as the first claimant to give evidence by video link. During the trial, which included the testimonies of Mia Farrow and others, it was proved that the alleged scene at the famous New York restaurant Elaine's could not possibly have taken place on the date given, because Polanski only dined at this restaurant three weeks later. Also, the Norwegian then-model disputed the accounts that he had claimed to be able to make her \"the next Sharon Tate\". Polanski was awarded  damages by the High Court in London. The case was notable because Polanski was living in France as a fugitive from U.S. justice, and never appeared in the London court for fear he would be extradited to the U.S. Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair, responded, \"I find it amazing that a man who lives in France can sue a magazine that is published in America in a British courtroom.\" On April 25, 2008, the televised entertainment program Entertainment Tonight reported that 15-year-old Miley Cyrus had posed topless for a photo shoot with Vanity Fair. The photo, and subsequently released behind-the-scenes photos, show Cyrus without a top, her bare back exposed but her front covered with a bedsheet. The photo shoot was taken by photographer Annie Leibovitz. The full photograph was published with an accompanying story on The New York Times website on April 27, 2008. On April 29, 2008, The New York Times clarified that though the pictures left an impression that she was bare-breasted, Cyrus was wrapped in a bedsheet and was actually not topless. Some parents expressed outrage at the nature of the photograph, which a Disney spokesperson described as \"a situation [that] was created to deliberately manipulate a 15-year-old to sell magazines\". In response to the internet circulation of the photo and ensuing media attention, Miley Cyrus released a statement of apology on April 27: \"I took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be 'artistic' and now, seeing the photographs and reading the story, I feel so embarrassed. I never intended for any of this to happen and I apologize to my fans who I care so deeply about.\" In 2013, Cond\u00e9 Nast Entertainment struck a deal with Discovery Communications-owned cable channel Investigation Discovery for Vanity Fair Confidential, a crime and mystery documentary TV series based on stories from Vanity Fair magazine. Cond\u00e9 Nast Entertainment launched a Vanity Fair YouTube channel in July 2013. In anticipation of its 100th anniversary that year, Vanity Fair co-produced 10 short films, one to celebrate each decade, from well-known documentary filmmakers like Barbara Kopple and including the film producer Judd Apatow, and actors Don Cheadle and Bryce Dallas Howard. In January 2014, Vanity Fair was under fire for allegedly altering the appearance of a celebrity featured in its pages for its February issue, Lupita Nyong'o, an actress known for her role in 12 Years A Slave. In Nyong'o's case, the magazine tweeted the photo and it began with fans accusing the company of altering her complexion. However, some believe that the Vanity Fair images are simply a product of bright set lighting, rather than deliberate skin lightening. Nyong'o was pleased with the work and saw no harm done to herself; she did not hold Vanity Fair or the photographer liable. Shortly before the Nyong'o case, Vogue magazine, a partner and buyer of Vanity Fair in 1936, was accused of altering actress Lena Dunham's photos. Dunham considered the modified photos to be offensive. Vanity Fair launched The Hive in June 2016, its online business, politics and technology news vertical. In January 2017, Vanity Fair'''s Hive and Cond\u00e9 Nast Entertainment partnered with Cheddar online TV channel to create a live weekly series called VF Hive on Cheddar. Editor Graydon Carter called the series a \"representation of how people are consuming more voraciously than ever\". In 2017 former editor Tina Brown published \"The Vanity Fair Diaries\". It was announced in November 2017 that Radhika Jones, editorial director of The New York Times books section, would succeed Carter as Editor-in-Chief on December 11, 2017. In 2018, Vanity Fair received accolades for removing actor James Franco from a cover shoot following sexual harassment allegations. In 2019, former contributing editor Vicky Ward said her 2003 profile of Jeffrey Epstein in Vanity Fair had included on-the-record accounts of Annie and Maria Farmer (who filed the earliest known criminal complaints about Epstein), but that they were later stricken from Ward's article after Epstein pressured the magazine's editor Graydon Carter."

In order to achieve this, promoting itself to the world was extremely urgent. Shanghai Daily was established at a time when it was needed to adopt English as its language as it was to target foreigners and English is the leading language of international discourse in the 21st century. It covers a wide range of news in order to show China and Shanghai comprehensively, involving geography, policies, business, economy, trading, entertainment, sports, society, culture among others.

It explains how fashion is on the lips of everyone in Shanghai and After Milan, Paris, London and New York, Shanghai is going to claim and candidate to become the oriental fashion capital. It gives an explanation on how Shanghai was started as a business port in 1843 and became one of the initial tones that got exposed to the western thoughts and fashion (Mersinkin, 2015).

In the newspaper it is still described as the modern designer fashion icon therefore attracting many people to Shanghai. The newspaper follows the Shanghai culture which was mainly shaped by the areas in the southern part of Tangtze River named as the region in today's Jiansu and Zhejiang provinces known as the ancient kingdom. It then goes to how the Shanghai-style fashion was developed in the middle of 1900s influenced by the culture that the westerners brought into the city. For instance the traditional Chinese outfit like the mandarin jacket were replaced by Western-style suits and accessories as the town change to one of the five ports forced open to international business following treaty signing of the Nanking by the United Kingdom and the Qing dynasty. The establishment of the Republic of China then facilitated the integration of the western and the eastern cultures. It explains how a classic look for men at that time consisted of a suit, pitched hat, glasses, gold frames among others whereas the look on women consisted of a simple turtleneck sweater and along skirt.

        "content": "New Horizons is an interplanetary space probe that was launched as a part of NASA's New Frontiers program. Engineered by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), with a team led by Alan Stern, the spacecraft was launched in 2006 with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the Pluto system in 2015, and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or more other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in the decade to follow, which became a mission to 486958 Arrokoth. It is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System. On January 19, 2006, New Horizons was launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station by an Atlas V rocket directly into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about . It was the fastest (average speed with respect to Earth) man-made object ever launched from Earth.  It is not the fastest speed recorded for a spacecraft, which as of 2021 is that of the Parker Solar Probe. After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL, New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter, making its closest approach on February 28, 2007, at a distance of . The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons speed; the flyby also enabled a general test of New Horizons scientific capabilities, returning data about the planet's atmosphere, moons, and magnetosphere. Most of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve on-board systems, except for brief annual checkouts. On December 6, 2014, New Horizons was brought back online for the Pluto encounter, and instrument check-out began. On January 15, 2015, the spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto. On July 14, 2015, at 11:49\u00a0UTC, it flew  above the surface of Pluto, which at the time was 34 AU from the Sun, making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet. In August 2016, New Horizons was reported to have traveled at speeds of more than . On October 25, 2016, at 21:48\u00a0UTC, the last of the recorded data from the Pluto flyby was received from New Horizons. Having completed its flyby of Pluto, New Horizons then maneuvered for a flyby of Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth (then nicknamed Ultima Thule), which occurred on January 1, 2019, when it was 43.4\u00a0AU from the Sun. In August 2018, NASA cited results by Alice on New Horizons to confirm the existence of a \"hydrogen wall\" at the outer edges of the Solar System. This \"wall\" was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft."

        "content": "In August 1992, JPL scientist Robert Staehle called Pluto discoverer Clyde Tombaugh, requesting permission to visit his planet. \"I told him he was welcome to it,\" Tombaugh later remembered, \"though he's got to go one long, cold trip.\" The call eventually led to a series of proposed Pluto missions, leading up to New Horizons. Stamatios \"Tom\" Krimigis, head of the Applied Physics Laboratory's space division, one of many entrants in the New Frontiers Program competition, formed the New Horizons team with Alan Stern in December 2000.  Appointed as the project's principal investigator, Stern was described by Krimigis as \"the personification of the Pluto mission\". New Horizons was based largely on Stern's work since Pluto 350 and involved most of the team from Pluto Kuiper Express. The New Horizons proposal was one of five that were officially submitted to NASA. It was later selected as one of two finalists to be subject to a three-month concept study, in June 2001. The other finalist, POSSE (Pluto and Outer Solar System Explorer), was a separate, but similar Pluto mission concept by the University of Colorado Boulder, led by principal investigator Larry W. Esposito, and supported by the JPL, Lockheed Martin and the University of California. However, the APL, in addition to being supported by Pluto Kuiper Express developers at the Goddard Space Flight Center and Stanford University, were at an advantage; they had recently developed NEAR Shoemaker for NASA, which had successfully entered orbit around 433 Eros earlier that year, and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare. In November 2001, New Horizons was officially selected for funding as part of the New Frontiers program. However, the new NASA Administrator appointed by the Bush Administration, Sean O'Keefe, was not supportive of New Horizons, and effectively cancelled it by not including it in NASA's budget for 2003. NASA's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate Ed Weiler prompted Stern to lobby for the funding of New Horizons in hopes of the mission appearing in the Planetary Science Decadal Survey; a prioritized \"wish list\", compiled by the United States National Research Council, that reflects the opinions of the scientific community. After an intense campaign to gain support for New Horizons, the Planetary Science Decadal Survey of 2003\u20132013 was published in the summer of 2002. New Horizons topped the list of projects considered the highest priority among the scientific community in the medium-size category; ahead of missions to the Moon, and even Jupiter. Weiler stated that it was a result that \"[his] administration was not going to fight\". Funding for the mission was finally secured following the publication of the report, and Stern's team was finally able to start building the spacecraft and its instruments, with a planned launch in January 2006 and arrival at Pluto in 2015. Alice Bowman became Mission Operations Manager (MOM)."

        "content": "New Horizons is the first mission in NASA's New Frontiers mission category, larger and more expensive than the Discovery missions but smaller than the missions of the Flagship Program. The cost of the mission (including spacecraft and instrument development, launch vehicle, mission operations, data analysis, and education/public outreach) is approximately $700\u00a0million over 15 years (2001\u20132016). The spacecraft was built primarily by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. The mission's principal investigator is Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute (formerly NASA Associate Administrator). After separation from the launch vehicle, overall control was taken by Mission Operations Center (MOC) at the Applied Physics Laboratory in Howard County, Maryland. The science instruments are operated at Clyde Tombaugh Science Operations Center (T-SOC) in Boulder, Colorado. Navigation is performed at various contractor facilities, whereas the navigational positional data and related celestial reference frames are provided by the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station through Headquarters NASA and JPL; KinetX is the lead on the New Horizons navigation team and is responsible for planning trajectory adjustments as the spacecraft speeds toward the outer Solar System. Coincidentally the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was where the photographic plates were taken for the discovery of Pluto's moon Charon; and the Naval Observatory itself is not far from the Lowell Observatory where Pluto was discovered. New Horizons was originally planned as a voyage to the only unexplored planet in the SolarSystem. When the spacecraft was launched, Pluto was still classified as a planet, later to be reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Some members of the New Horizons team, including Alan Stern, disagree with the IAU definition and still describe Pluto as the ninth planet. Pluto's satellites Nix and Hydra also have a connection with the spacecraft: the first letters of their names (N and H) are the initials of New Horizons. The moons' discoverers chose these names for this reason, plus Nix and Hydra's relationship to the mythological Pluto. In addition to the science equipment, there are several cultural artifacts traveling with the spacecraft.

As a point of departure, the team took inspiration from the Ulysses spacecraft, which also carried a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) and dish on a box-in-box structure through the outer Solar System. Many subsystems and components have flight heritage from APL's CONTOUR spacecraft, which in turn had heritage from APL's TIMED spacecraft. New Horizons body forms a triangle, almost  thick. (The Pioneers have hexagonal bodies, whereas the Voyagers, Galileo, and Cassini\u2013Huygens have decagonal, hollow bodies.) A 7075 aluminium alloy tube forms the main structural column, between the launch vehicle adapter ring at the \"rear\", and the  radio dish antenna affixed to the \"front\" flat side. The titanium fuel tank is in this tube. The RTG attaches with a 4-sided titanium mount resembling a gray pyramid or stepstool. Titanium provides strength and thermal isolation. The rest of the triangle is primarily sandwich panels of thin aluminum face sheet (less than ) bonded to aluminum honeycomb core. The structure is larger than strictly necessary, with empty space inside. The structure is designed to act as shielding, reducing electronics errors caused by radiation from the RTG. Also, the mass distribution required for a spinning spacecraft demands a wider triangle. The interior structure is painted black to equalize temperature by radiative heat transfer. Overall, the spacecraft is thoroughly blanketed to retain heat. Unlike the Pioneers and Voyagers, the radio dish is also enclosed in blankets that extend to the body. The heat from the RTG adds warmth to the spacecraft while it is in the outer Solar System. While in the inner Solar System, the spacecraft must prevent overheating, hence electronic activity is limited, power is diverted to shunts with attached radiators, and louvers are opened to radiate excess heat. While the spacecraft is cruising inactively in the cold outer Solar System, the louvers are closed, and the shunt regulator reroutes power to electric heaters."

As of January 2019, the power output of the RTG is about . The RTG, model \"GPHS-RTG\", was originally a spare from the Cassini mission. The RTG contains  of plutonium-238 oxide pellets. Each pellet is clad in iridium, then encased in a graphite shell. It was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy at the Materials and Fuels Complex, a part of the Idaho National Laboratory. The original RTG design called for   of plutonium, but a unit less powerful than the original design goal was produced because of delays at the United States Department of Energy, including security activities, that delayed plutonium production. The mission parameters and observation sequence had to be modified for the reduced wattage; still, not all instruments can operate simultaneously. The Department of Energy transferred the space battery program from Ohio to Argonne in 2002 because of security concerns. The amount of radioactive plutonium in the RTG is about one-third the amount on board the Cassini\u2013Huygens probe when it launched in 1997. The Cassini launch had been protested by multiple organizations, due to the risk of such a large amount of plutonium being released into the atmosphere in case of an accident. The United States Department of Energy estimated the chances of a launch accident that would release radiation into the atmosphere at 1 in 350, and monitored the launch because of the inclusion of an RTG on board.

        "content": "Communication with the spacecraft is via X band. The craft had a communication rate of  at Jupiter; at Pluto's distance, a rate of approximately  per transmitter was expected. Besides the low data rate, Pluto's distance also causes a latency of about 4.5\u00a0hours (one-way). The  NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) dishes are used to relay commands once the spacecraft is beyond Jupiter.  The spacecraft uses dual modular redundancy transmitters and receivers, and either right- or left-hand circular polarization.  The downlink signal is amplified by dual redundant 12-watt traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) mounted on the body under the dish. The receivers are new, low-power designs. The system can be controlled to power both TWTAs at the same time, and transmit a dual-polarized downlink signal to the DSN that nearly doubles the downlink rate. DSN tests early in the mission with this dual polarization combining technique were successful, and the capability is now considered operational (when the spacecraft power budget permits both TWTAs to be powered). In addition to the high-gain antenna, there are two backup low-gain antennas and a medium-gain dish. The high-gain dish has a Cassegrain reflector layout, composite construction, of  diameter providing over  of gain and a half-power beam width of about a degree. The prime-focus medium-gain antenna, with a  aperture and 10\u00b0 half-power beam width, is mounted to the back of the high-gain antenna's secondary reflector. The forward low-gain antenna is stacked atop the feed of the medium-gain antenna. The aft low-gain antenna is mounted within the launch adapter at the rear of the spacecraft. This antenna was used only for early mission phases near Earth, just after launch and for emergencies if the spacecraft had lost attitude control. New Horizons recorded scientific instrument data to its solid-state memory buffer at each encounter, then transmitted the data to Earth. Data storage is done on two low-power solid-state recorders (one primary, one backup) holding up to s each. Because of the extreme distance from Pluto and the Kuiper belt, only one buffer load at those encounters can be saved. This is because New Horizons would require approximately 16 months after leaving the vicinity of Pluto to transmit the buffer load back to Earth. At Pluto's distance, radio signals from the space probe back to Earth took four hours and 25 minutes to traverse 4.7\u00a0billion km of space. Part of the reason for the delay between the gathering of and transmission of data is that all of the New Horizons instrumentation is body-mounted. In order for the cameras to record data, the entire probe must turn, and the one-degree-wide beam of the high-gain antenna was not pointing toward Earth.  Previous spacecraft, such as the Voyager program probes, had a rotatable instrumentation platform (a \"scan platform\") that could take measurements from virtually any angle without losing radio contact with Earth.  New Horizons was mechanically simplified to save weight, shorten the schedule, and improve reliability during its 15-year lifetime. The Voyager 2 scan platform jammed at Saturn, and the demands of long time exposures at outer planets led to a change of plans such that the entire probe was rotated to make photos at Uranus and Neptune, similar to how New Horizons rotated."

The probe finally lifted off from Pad 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, directly south of Space Shuttle Launch Complex 39, at 19:00\u00a0UTC on January 19, 2006. The Centaur second stage ignited at 19:04:43\u00a0UTC and burned for 5 minutes 25 seconds. It reignited at 19:32\u00a0UTC and burned for 9 minutes 47 seconds.

New Horizons took only nine hours to pass the Moon's orbit. Although there were backup launch opportunities in February 2006 and February 2007, only the first twenty-three days of the 2006 window permitted the Jupiter flyby. Any launch outside that period would have forced the spacecraft to fly a slower trajectory directly to Pluto, delaying its encounter by five to six years.

More detailed exploration of the system began in January 2007 with an infrared image of the moon Callisto, as well as several black-and-white images of Jupiter itself. New Horizons received a gravity assist from Jupiter, with its closest approach at 05:43:40\u00a0UTC on February 28, 2007, when it was  from Jupiter. The flyby increased New Horizons speed by , accelerating the probe to a velocity of  relative to the Sun and shortening its voyage to Pluto by three years. The flyby was the center of a four-month intensive observation campaign lasting from January to June. Being an ever-changing scientific target, Jupiter has been observed intermittently since the end of the Galileo mission in September 2003. Knowledge about Jupiter benefited from the fact that New Horizons instruments were built using the latest technology, especially in the area of cameras, representing a significant improvement over Galileo cameras, which were modified versions of Voyager cameras, which, in turn, were modified Mariner cameras. The Jupiter encounter also served as a shakedown and dress rehearsal for the Pluto encounter. Because Jupiter is much closer to Earth than Pluto, the communications link can transmit multiple loadings of the memory buffer; thus the mission returned more data from the Jovian system than it was expected to transmit from Pluto. One of the main goals during the Jupiter encounter was observing its atmospheric conditions and analyzing the structure and composition of its clouds. Heat-induced lightning strikes in the polar regions and \"waves\" that indicate violent storm activity were observed and measured. The Little Red Spot, spanning up to 70% of Earth's diameter, was imaged from up close for the first time. Recording from different angles and illumination conditions, New Horizons took detailed images of Jupiter's faint ring system, discovering debris left over from recent collisions within the rings or from other unexplained phenomena. The search for undiscovered moons within the rings showed no results. Travelling through Jupiter's magnetosphere, New Horizons collected valuable particle readings. \"Bubbles\" of plasma that are thought to be formed from material ejected by the moon Io were noticed in the magnetotail."

Redundant components as well as guidance and control systems were shut down to extend their life cycle, decrease operation costs and free the Deep Space Network for other missions. During hibernation mode, the onboard computer monitored the probe's systems and transmitted a signal back to Earth; a \"green\" code if everything was functioning as expected or a \"red\" code if mission control's assistance was needed. The probe was activated for about two months a year so that the instruments could be calibrated and the systems checked. The first hibernation mode cycle started on June 28, 2007, the second cycle began on December 16, 2008, the third cycle on August 27, 2009, and the fourth cycle on August 29, 2014, after a 10-week test. New Horizons crossed the orbit of Saturn on June 8, 2008, and Uranus on March 18, 2011. After astronomers announced the discovery of two new moons in the Pluto system, Kerberos and Styx, mission planners started contemplating the possibility of the probe running into unseen debris and dust left over from ancient collisions between the moons. A study based on 18 months of computer simulations, Earth-based telescope observations and occultations of the Pluto system revealed that the possibility of a catastrophic collision with debris or dust was less than 0.3% on the probe's scheduled course. If the hazard increased, New Horizons could have used one of two possible contingency plans, the so-called SHBOTs (Safe Haven by Other Trajectories). Either the probe could have continued on its present trajectory with the antenna facing the incoming particles so the more vital systems would be protected, or it could have positioned its antenna to make a course correction that would take it just 3000\u00a0km from the surface of Pluto where it was expected that the atmospheric drag would have cleaned the surrounding space of possible debris. While in hibernation mode in July 2012, New Horizons started gathering scientific data with SWAP, PEPSSI and VBSDC. Although it was originally planned to activate just the VBSDC, other instruments were powered on in order to collect valuable heliospheric data. Before activating the other two instruments, ground tests were conducted to make sure that the expanded data gathering in this phase of the mission would not limit available energy, memory and fuel in the future and that all systems were functioning during the flyby. The first set of data was transmitted in January 2013 during a three-week activation from hibernation. The command and data handling software was updated to address the problem of computer resets."

On this date, images of the targets with the onboard LORRI imager plus the Ralph telescope were only a few pixels in width. Investigators began taking Pluto images and background starfield images to assist mission navigators in the design of course-correcting engine maneuvers that would precisely modify the trajectory of New Horizons to aim the approach. On February 12, 2015, NASA released new images of Pluto (taken from January 25 to 31) from the approaching probe. New Horizons was more than  away from Pluto when it began taking the photos, which showed Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. The exposure time was too short to see Pluto's smaller, much fainter moons. Investigators compiled a series of images of the moons Nix and Hydra taken from January 27 through February 8, 2015, beginning at a range of . Pluto and Charon appear as a single overexposed object at the center. The right side image has been processed to remove the background starfield. The other two, even smaller moons, Kerberos and Styx were seen on photos taken on April 25. Starting May 11 a hazard search was performed, looking for unknown objects that could be a danger to the spacecraft, such as rings or hithero undiscovered moons, which could then possibly be avoided by a course change. No rings or additional moons were found. Also in regard to the approach phase during January 2015, on August 21, 2012, the team announced that they would spend mission time attempting long-range observations of the Kuiper belt object temporarily designated VNH0004 (now designated ), when the object was at a distance from New Horizons of . The object would be too distant to resolve surface features or take spectroscopy, but it would be able to make observations that cannot be made from Earth, namely a phase curve and a search for small moons. A second object was planned to be observed in June 2015, and a third in September after the flyby; the team hoped to observe a dozen such objects through 2018.

On July 5, NASA announced that the problem was determined to be a timing flaw in a command sequence used to prepare the spacecraft for its flyby, and the spacecraft would resume scheduled science operations on July 7. The science observations lost because of the anomaly were judged to have no impact on the mission's main objectives and minimal impact on other objectives. The timing flaw consisted of performing two tasks simultaneously\u2014compressing previously acquired data to release space for more data, and making a second copy of the approach command sequence\u2014that together overloaded the spacecraft's primary computer. After the overload was detected, the spacecraft performed as designed: it switched from the primary computer to the backup computer, entered safe mode, and sent a distress call back to Earth. The distress call was received the afternoon of July 4 and alerted engineers that they needed to contact the spacecraft to get more information and resolve the issue. The resolution was that the problem happened as part of preparations for the approach, and was not expected to happen again because no similar tasks were planned for the remainder of the encounter."

New Horizons had a relative velocity of  at its closest approach, and came as close as  to Charon. Starting 3.2 days before the closest approach, long-range imaging included the mapping of Pluto and Charon to  resolution. This is half the rotation period of the Pluto\u2013Charon system and allowed imaging of all sides of both bodies. Close range imaging was repeated twice per day in order to search for surface changes caused by localized snow fall or surface cryovolcanism. Because of Pluto's tilt, a portion of the northern hemisphere would be in shadow at all times. During the flyby, engineers expected LORRI to be able to obtain select images with resolution as high as  if closest distance were around 12,500\u00a0km, and MVIC was expected to obtain four-color global dayside maps at  resolution. LORRI and MVIC attempted to overlap their respective coverage areas to form stereo pairs. LEISA obtained hyperspectral near-infrared maps at  globally and  for selected areas. Meanwhile, Alice characterized the atmosphere, both by emissions of atmospheric molecules (airglow), and by dimming of background stars as they pass behind Pluto (occultation). During and after closest approach, SWAP and PEPSSI sampled the high atmosphere and its effects on the solar wind. VBSDC searched for dust, inferring meteoroid collision rates and any invisible rings. REX performed active and passive radio science. The communications dish on Earth measured the disappearance and reappearance of the radio occultation signal as the probe flew by behind Pluto. The results resolved Pluto's diameter (by their timing) and atmospheric density and composition (by their weakening and strengthening pattern). (Alice can perform similar occultations, using sunlight instead of radio beacons.) Previous missions had the spacecraft transmit through the atmosphere, to Earth (\"downlink\"). Pluto's mass and mass distribution were evaluated by the gravitational tug on the spacecraft. As the spacecraft speeds up and slows down, the radio signal exhibited a Doppler shift. The Doppler shift was measured by comparison with the ultrastable oscillator in the communications electronics. Reflected sunlight from Charon allowed some imaging observations of the nightside. Backlighting by the Sun gave an opportunity to highlight any rings or atmospheric hazes. REX performed radiometry of the nightside."

The spacecraft's immediate task was to begin returning the 6.25 gigabytes of information collected. The free-space path loss at its distance of 4.5 light-hours (3,000,000,000\u00a0km) is approximately 303 dB at 7\u00a0GHz. Using the high gain antenna and transmitting at full power, the signal from EIRP is +83 dBm, and at this distance the signal reaching Earth is \u2212220 dBm. The received signal level (RSL) using one, un-arrayed Deep Space Network antenna with 72 dBi of forward gain equals \u2212148 dBm. Because of the extremely low RSL, it could only transmit data at 1 to 2 kilobits per second. By March 30, 2016, about nine months after the flyby, New Horizons reached the halfway point of transmitting this data.

Because the flight path was determined by the Pluto flyby, and the probe only had 33 kilograms of hydrazine propellant remaining, the object to be visited needed to be within a cone of less than a degree's width extending from Pluto. The target also needed to be within 55AU, because beyond 55AU, the communications link becomes too weak, and the RTG power output decays significantly enough to hinder observations.

The ground-based search resulted in the discovery of about 143 KBOs of potential interest, but none of these were close enough to the flight path of New Horizons. Only the Hubble Space Telescope was deemed likely to find a suitable target in time for a successful KBO mission. On June 16, 2014, time on Hubble was granted for a search.

The targets were at distances from the Sun ranging from 43 to 44 AU, which would put the encounters in the 2018\u20132019 period. The initial estimated probabilities that these objects were reachable within New Horizons fuel budget were 100%, 7%, and 97%, respectively. All were members of the \"cold\" (low-inclination, low-eccentricity) classical Kuiper belt objects, and thus were very different from Pluto. PT1 (given the temporary designation \"1110113Y\" on the HST web site), the most favorably situated object, had a magnitude of 26.8, is  in diameter, and was encountered in January 2019. A course change to reach it required about 35% of New Horizons available trajectory-adjustment fuel supply.  A mission to PT3 was in some ways preferable, in that it is brighter and therefore probably larger than PT1, but the greater fuel requirements to reach it would have left less for maneuvering and unforeseen events. Once sufficient orbital information was provided, the Minor Planet Center gave provisional designations to the three target KBOs:  (later 486958 Arrokoth) (PT1),  (PT2), and  (PT3). By the fall of 2014, a possible fourth target, , had been eliminated by follow-up observations. PT2 was out of the running before the Pluto flyby."

This depends on a suitable Kuiper belt object being found or confirmed close enough to the spacecraft's current trajectory. Since May 2020, the New Horizons team has been using time on the Subaru Telescope to look for suitable candidates within the spacecraft's proximity. As of November 2020, none have been found close enough to the trajectory of New Horizons for it to be able to make a close flyby with its remaining fuel. In addition, New Horizons may take a picture of Earth from its distance in the Kuiper belt, but only after completing all planned KBO flybys. This is because pointing a camera towards Earth could cause the camera to be damaged by sunlight, as none of New Horizons''' cameras have an active shutter mechanism.

De Morgen was modelled on French daily Liberation. The paper is published by De Persgroep which also publishes Het Laatste Nieuws. De Morgen presents itself as an independent and progressive newspaper and a more dynamic alternative to its two competitors in the Flemish market, De Standaard and De Tijd. On the other hand, the paper is described as a leftist and socialistic publication. According to the former editor-in-chief , the Flemish press was \"de-pillarized\" under the influence of De Morgen.

        "content": "After the band's 1984 debut album, singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr produced the album themselves, assisted only by engineer Stephen Street. They had first met Stephen Street on the session for \"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\" and requested his contact number. Officially, the record's production is credited to \"The Smiths\". To build the album's soundscape, Morrissey provided Marr and Street with his personal copies of BBC sound effects records from which to source samples. Morrissey would continue this practice on future Smiths singles and albums.Meat Is Murder was more strident and political than its predecessor, including the pro-vegetarian title track (Morrissey forbade the rest of the group from being photographed eating meat), and the anti-corporal punishment \"The Headmaster Ritual\". Musically, the band had grown more adventurous, with Marr and Rourke channelling rockabilly and funk influences in \"Rusholme Ruffians\" and \"Barbarism Begins at Home\" respectively. \"Rusholme Ruffians\" interpolates the Victoria Wood song \"Fourteen Again\". Author John King has suggested that the title track was inspired by the 1983 song \"Meat Means Murder\" by the anarcho-punk band Conflict, which deals with the same topic and also opens at a slow pace. Morrissey also brought a political stance to many of his interviews. Among his targets were the Thatcher administration, the monarchy, and his musical contemporaries. When asked about Band Aid, which was being strongly promoted in the UK media at the time, he quipped, \"One can have great concern for the people of Ethiopia, but it's another thing to inflict daily torture on the people of England\". Similarly, he began to promote vegetarianism in live shows and interviews, on one occasion convincing a Scottish TV show to air footage of slaughterhouses during the dinner hour."

The film More featured a young hitchhiker in Ibiza who had succumbed to heroin abuse with party scenes and drug taking. Director Barbet Schroeder was a fan of the group, and brought a rough cut of the film to London for them to work with. Instead of typical background music, Schroeder wanted the songs to feature in the film, such as a record playing at a party. The group also speculated they could branch out into a career as film composers if their recording and touring career did not work out. Drummer Nick Mason later said the film was \"ideally suited to some of the rumblings, squeaks and sound textures we produced on a regular basis\"."

        "content": "The album was recorded at Pye Studios in London, in late January and early February 1969 with engineer Brian Humphries. The album was the first to be produced by Pink Floyd without assistance from Norman Smith, who retained an executive producer credit, and the first full album without Syd Barrett, who had been ousted from the group in 1968, during the recording of their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets. Pink Floyd worked out most of the music in two weeks, with material put together quickly and semi-improvised. They did not use a dubbing studio due to budget constraints, and simply timed sequences in the film with a stopwatch so they knew how long the music had to be. Bassist Roger Waters wrote most of the lyrics during breaks between recording backing tracks. Schroeder was impressed by how quickly the group created and recorded the material. Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright co-wrote the instrumental \"Up The Khyber\", the only time the pair were credited as sole co-composers. Barrett's replacement David Gilmour handled all lead vocals on the album. More features a mixture of styles. Songs such as \"Green is the Colour\" were acoustic folk ballads, a genre not often explored by the group. Mason's wife Lindy played penny whistle on the track. The album also contains hard rock, such as \"The Nile Song\" and \"Ibiza Bar\", as well as several instrumental tracks such as \"Quicksilver\" and \"Main Theme\", featuring their experimental and avant-garde approach. \"Cymbaline\" criticised the music industry, with lines such as \"your manager and agent are both busy on the phone\". The version on the album is different from that in the film. Gilmour sings lead on both versions, though Waters is sometimes wrongly credited as singing lead for the film version. \"Green is the Colour\" was played live frequently after release, as a medley with \"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\", as part of a live suite called \"The Journey\". It was a regular feature in the set for two years afterwards. \"Quicksilver\" was played under the title \"Sleeping\" as part of the 1969 live show called \"The Man\", while \"Cymbaline\" was entitled \"Nightmare\". The latter remained part of the group's repertoire until the end of 1971. In live performances, the group left the stage partway through the song while the audience listened to a tape of quadraphonic sound effects including footsteps travelling round the venue, and doors opening. \"Main Theme\" was briefly played live in 1970. Two songs can be heard in the film which were not included on the album: \"Hollywood\" and \"Seabirds\". The latter was published in 1976's The Pink Floyd Songbook. Both songs, as well as two other songs from those sessions, \"Theme (Beat Version)\" and \"More Blues (Alternative Version)\", were released on the 2016 box set, The Early Years 1965\u20131972. The set in which these tracks appear, 1969: Dramatis/ation was made available as a standalone release in 2017. \"Seabirds\" was an alternative take of \"Quicksilver\"."

        "content": "Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game was co-developed by Hudson Soft and Creatures. Creatures' official website describes their work on the game as \"planning and game design, card design\". Tsunekazu Ishihara, founder of Creatures and designer of the card game, is credited as one of the game's producers. Curiously, Hudson is not credited anywhere on the game's package, cartridge, or title screen. However, the ending credits list them as the game's developer. Although Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game features most cards from the first three sets of the collectible card game, two real-life cards are absent from the Game Boy Color version: Electrode from the base set, and Ditto from Fossil. The cards were excluded as it was difficult to translate their tabletop effects to the video game engine, but they are replaced by game-exclusive cards of the same Pok\u00e9mon (the Electrode card was later made available in Japan via an online card shop). The game features cameos from President and CEO of The Pok\u00e9mon Company Tsunekazu Ishihara as \"Mr. Ishihara\", and musician Tomoaki Imakuni under his stage name Imakuni?."

In September 1999, Nintendo of America announced that they would be releasing an English version in North America with the proposed title of simply Pok\u00e9mon Card. Though initially planned for release the following winter, the game, now known under its finalized title of Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, was pushed back to April 2000, which IGN attributed to the company wanting to focus their efforts on the upcoming Pok\u00e9mon Stadium for the Nintendo 64. The following February, the game made an appearance at the 2000 Toy Fair in New York City as part of Nintendo's \"Pok\u00e9mon 2000\" interactive line-up along with Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver. An exclusive tabletop version promotional card from Wizards of the Coast featuring Meowth was included with the game."

It would go on to sell an additional 1.51 million copies during its first year in North America, and received mostly positive reception from critics, earning an 81.25% average score from aggregate review website GameRankings. GameSpot referred to the game as \"a faithful and amusing adaptation of the collectible card game\" calling the gameplay \"addictive\", but found it to be overall less satisfying than the original Pok\u00e9mon role-playing games, stating that its goal of 'collecting all 226 pieces of paper' just doesn't satisfy like 'catching 'em all' can and does.\" Others, such as IGN called the game \"a blast to play\" and that it offered mostly the same experience as the tabletop version \"without the clutter or cost\", yet acknowledged that the video game adaption could not fully replicate the original given the finite number of cards available. Though the website found its main story to be \"simple and basic\", and gameplay to be largely luck-based, it ultimately declared that \"whether you like or hate those darn Pok\u00e9mon... if Nintendo keeps making Pok\u00e9mon videogames of this quality, those creatures aren't going away anytime soon.\" GamesRadar ranked it the 50th best game available on the Game Boy and/or Game Boy Color. The staff called it an \"excellent addition to Pokemons Game Boy catalog.\" In a 2009 retrospective of Pok\u00e9mon spin-offs, IGN retained their high praise for the game, stating \"It was really kind of ridiculous how awesome this game turned out to be...if there was one spin-off [we] could ask Nintendo to reintroduce, it'd be the TCG game.\""

Like its predecessor, the game was developed by Hudson Soft and Creatures, but unlike its predecessor, it was only published by The Pok\u00e9mon Company, which also marks the first time a Pok\u00e9mon game was ever published by The Pok\u00e9mon Company. It was first announced in January 2001 by Japanese website WatchImpress. It includes new enhancements, such as the ability to choose the gender of the player character, a training mode to help new players, a Deck Diagnosis to rate the effectiveness of a player's deck, and a new group of antagonists known as Team Great Rocket. The game features all cards from the original game, along with new cards from the fourth set, Team Rocket, as well as cards originally exclusive to Japanese vending machines and the Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game Instructional Video Intro Pack, bringing the total number of cards to 445. Like the previous title, players must travel across the game world challenging non-player characters to simulated battles using rules adopted from the original tabletop version. All locations from the original are present, along with a new setting known as GR Island which contains its own Battle Masters for players to encounter. By defeating a total of 16 Battle Masters on the old and new islands, players may challenge the game's final boss, King Biruritchi. Though an English release in North America was deemed \"likely\" by website IGN in 2001, the game has not been made available outside Japan. Pok\u00e9mon Card GB2 earned a 29 out of 40 score from Japanese Weekly Famitsu magazine."

The album was released on September 17, 1991, the same day as its counterpart Use Your Illusion I. Both albums were released in conjunction with the Use Your Illusion Tour. Bolstered by the lead single \"You Could Be Mine\", Use Your Illusion II was the slightly more popular of the two albums, selling 770,000 copies its first week and debuting at No. 1 on the U.S. charts, ahead of Use Your Illusion I'''s first-week sales of 685,000. As of 2010, Use Your Illusion II has sold 5,587,000 units in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Both albums have since been certified 7\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA. It was also No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart for a single week. It is the last Guns N' Roses album to feature rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin. It also includes \"Civil War\", the last track to feature drummer Steven Adler in any capacity. This album, along with the counterpart of the album, was the last Guns N' Roses album to feature original material until 2008's album Chinese Democracy."

        "title": "Use Your Illusion II_Overview",
        "content": "The Use Your Illusion albums were a stylistic turning point for Guns N' Roses (see Use Your Illusion I). In addition, Use Your Illusion II is more political than most of their previous work, with songs like \"Civil War\", a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\", and \"Get in the Ring\" dealing respectively with the topics of violence, law enforcement and media bias. The thematic material deals less with drug use than previous Guns N' Roses albums. Use Your Illusion I featured several songs pre-Appetite for Destruction while Use Your Illusion II featured more tracks written during and after Appetite For Destruction. The band's cover of \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" had been released almost a year earlier on the Days of Thunder soundtrack, while \"Civil War\" debuted at the 1990 Farm Aid concert. That concert also featured Guns N' Roses playing a cover of the U.K. Subs song \"Down on the Farm\", a studio version of which would later appear on the band's 1993 release of cover songs, \"The Spaghetti Incident?\". \"Civil War\" was released as a B-side to \"You Could Be Mine\". The song had also been released on a charity album called Nobody's Child, a fund-raising compilation for Romanian orphans. \"You Could Be Mine\" was released in June 1991 and is featured in the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The song was not released on the actual soundtrack. The band also filmed a video featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in character as the Terminator, with a loose plot featuring Axl Rose as its \"target\". However, he is saved from termination as he is deemed a \"waste of ammo\" by the T-800's lock-on system. The original subject matter of the song dealt with Izzy Stradlin's failed relationship with ex-girlfriend Angela Nicoletti. The Use Your Illusion albums can be considered a single cohesive work, and certain elements of Use Your Illusion II underscore this intent. For instance, both albums have a version of the song \"Don't Cry\", and both have one cover song; \"Live and Let Die\" by Paul McCartney (Use Your Illusion I) and \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" by Bob Dylan (Use Your Illusion II). Each also has at least one track sung by other members of the band: lead vocals are performed by bassist Duff McKagan on \"So Fine,\" a song that was dedicated to punk rock musician Johnny Thunders, who died from a drug overdose before the recording of the album. The song \"Get in the Ring\" finds the band lashing out at a career's worth of critics and enemies. Among those referred to by name are editors of several entertainment magazines. The industrial flavored \"My World\", the final track, was written and recorded in three hours, with Rose claiming those in the recording room were on mushrooms at the time. The band had some difficulty achieving the final sound, especially during the mixing stages of both albums. According to a 1991 cover story by Rolling Stone magazine, after mixing 21 tracks with engineer/producer Bob Clearmountain, the band fired Clearmountain when he tried to replace the real drums with samples. According to Slash's autobiography, \"one afternoon we discovered a notepad of his where he'd notated all the drum samples he planned to mix in over Matt's drum tracks\" the band decided to scrap the mixes and start from scratch with engineer Bill Price of Sex Pistols fame. Slash has stated that most of the material for the album was written on acoustic guitars in a couple of nights at his house (the Walnut House), after several months of non-productivity. According to Slash \"Breakdown\" was one of the most complicated songs to record on the album; the banjo, drum, and piano parts were hard to synchronize and drummer Matt Sorum \"lost it\" a couple of times trying to get the drums just right. The song \"Locomotive\" was written in a house Slash and Izzy Stradlin rented in the Hollywood Hills following the Appetite for Destruction tours. The song shows the group dabbling in funk metal, and is also the only song on either album where the phrase \"use your illusion\" appears as a lyric."

The highlighted figure, unlike many of those in the painting, has not been identified with any specific philosopher. The only difference in the artwork between the albums is the color scheme used for each album. Use Your Illusion II uses blue and purple. The original painting was titled by Paul Kostabi as Use Your Illusion and also became the title of both albums. Both Use Your Illusion albums' liner notes include the message \"Fuck You, St. Louis!\" amongst the thank you notes, a reference to the Riverport Riot near there at the Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre in July 1991 during the Use Your Illusion Tour. ReceptionUse Your Illusion II received positive reviews, though some critics rated it lower than Use Your Illusion I. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, in a 3 out of 5 review, stated \"Use Your Illusion II is more serious and ambitious than I, but it's also considerably more pretentious.\" Erlewine criticized what he perceived as filler on the album, singling out the songs \"So Fine\", \"Get in the Ring\", \"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\", \"My World\" and the alternate version of \"Don't Cry\". Rolling Stone stated \"the band rewards the loyal legions \u2013 with 14 songs, which range from ballad to battle, pretty to vulgar, worldly to incredibly naive.\" The Chicago Tribune (in a dual review with Use Your Illusion I), stated the albums \"represent a staggering leap in ambition, musicianship, production and songwriting\" and \"rank with the best hard rock of the last decade.\" Rolling Stone'' listed the album at number 41 in their list \"100 Best Albums of the 90s\"."

Originally from the Venetian language, it has entered the vocabulary of English and of many other languages around the world. Its dual meaning of \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" makes it similar to shalom in Hebrew, salaam in Arabic, annyeong in Korean, aloha in Hawaiian, and ch\u00e0o in Vietnamese (the latter is a false cognate; the two words are not genetically related despite sounding similar to each other)."

        "content": "The word derives from the Venetian phrase s-ci\u00e0o vostro or s-ci\u00e0o su literally meaning \"(I am) your slave\". This greeting is analogous to the medieval Latin servus which is still used colloquially in parts of Central/Eastern Europe or the antiquated English valediction \"Your Obedient Servant.\" The expression was not a literal statement of fact, but rather a perfunctory promise of good will among friends (along the lines of \"at your service\" in English). The Venetian word for \"slave\", s-ci\u00e0o  or s-ci\u00e0vo, derives from Medieval Latin sclavus, a loanword from Medieval Greek \u03a3\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, related to the ethnic \"Slavic\", since most of the slaves came from the Balkans. This greeting was eventually shortened to ci\u00e0o, lost all its servile connotations and came to be used as an informal salutation by speakers of all classes.  In modern Italian language, the word is used (in addition to the meaning of salutation) as an exclamation of resignation (also in a positive sense), as in Oh, va be', ciao! (\"Oh, well, never mind!\"). A Milanese tongue-twister says Se gh'hinn gh'hinn; se gh'hinn n\u00f2, s'ci\u00e0o (\"If there is [money], there is; if there isn't, farewell! [there's nothing we can do]\")."

It has since spread to many countries in Europe, along with other items of the Italian culture. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the greeting (spelled 'chau' and only meaning 'bye') spread to the Americas\u2014especially Colombia, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Brazil (as 'tchau'), Venezuela, Panama and Argentina\u2014largely by way of Italian immigrants. In today's Cuba, \"ciao\" as a closing in letters has largely replaced the more traditional \"adi\u00f3s,\" with its religious implications, for many young people. 'Ciao' has also permeated Australian culture, becoming a popular greeting among descendants of Italian immigrants. It is also common in some varieties of South African English. Ciao has also been used in some parts of Romania as a way to say \u201cgoodbye\u201d. Ernest Hemingway's novel A Farewell to Arms (1929), which is set in northeast Italy during World War I, is credited with bringing the word into the English language."

American English) in Portuguese. It can be used in Italian to express sarcasm at another person's point of view about one topic, especially when that opinion sounds outdated, in which case the meaning is comparable to the English \"Yeah, right!\" In all these cases, however, the special meaning is conferred more by the vocal inflection than by the modified use."

        "content": "Read My Lips is the debut studio album by English singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor. It was released on 27 August 2001 by Polydor Records. After the disbandment of the Britpop group Theaudience, in which Ellis-Bextor served as vocalist, she was signed to Polydor. Prior to the LP's completion, the singer collaborated with several musicians, including band Blur's bassist Alex James, Moby and New Radicals frontman Gregg Alexander. The record was described as a collection of 1980s electronica and 1970s disco music. Critical response to Read My Lips was polarised, with music critics denouncing its content that was, according to many of whom, of lesser quality than \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\"\u2014the singer's collaboration with Italian DJ Spiller. The album reached number two on the UK Albums Chart, and has since been certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It spawned four singles: \"Take Me Home\", \"Murder on the Dancefloor\", double A-side single \"Get Over You\"/\"Move This Mountain\" and \"Music Gets the Best of Me\"."

        "content": "Following the disbandment of Britpop group Theaudience, Ellis-Bextor provided vocals for the song \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" by Italian DJ Spiller. The song was a commercial success, and Ellis-Bextor signed to Polydor. She was contacted by director Baz Luhrmann, who offered her a role in the 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, but the singer refused in order to focus on her career as a recording artist. The success of \"Groovejet\" also prompted American musician Moby to notice Ellis-Bextor, and revealed interest in working with her due to her \"amazing\" voice, as he described it. He instructed his record company to \"track\" Ellis-Bextor \"down\" so they could start working as soon as Moby finished his tour. The two ultimately wrote five songs in New York City, which did not make the final cut of Read My Lips. Furthermore, she also recorded with Blur bassist Alex James, as well as former frontman of the New Radicals, Gregg Alexander, while Damian LeGassick was recruited for his programming and keyboard work. The album's title was chosen due to the strong lipstick Ellis-Bextor used for the album artwork and the \"Take Me Home\" music video. The album photography was shot by Mert Alas."

The album opener and first single is a cover version of Cher's 1979 song \"Take Me Home\", described as a \"disco groove\". Betty Clarke from The Guardian observed that her voice in the song is reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn's Eliza Doolittle (in the movie My Fair Lady). \"Move This Mountain\", co-written by Alex James, is a \"vibrant\" ballad with a trip hop-influenced sound. Following track and second single, \"Murder on the Dancefloor\", is a dance-pop and disco record, that utilises bass guitar and piano in its instrumental. \"Sparkle\" has \"speeding beats and equally speeding keyboards\", while \"Final Move\" contains \"tinny beats\" and \"electro swirls\". The latter was deemed a \"subdued version\" of \"Murder on the Dancefloor\" with \"similar kaleidoscope synth\". \"I Believe\" was described as \"funky\" and \"live-sounding\", while \"Leave the Others Alone\" involves \"cold beats\" and \"big, full-throttle keyboards\". \"By Chance\" was particularly noted for showcasing Ellis-Bextor's accent. Re-release new song \"Get Over You\" is a \"polite\" Euro disco take on \"I Will Survive\"."

He also found that the album's music and the distinctive pronunciation of Ellis-Bextor's vocal delivery did not work to complimentary effect. Betty Clarke from The Guardian described the album as a \"sophisticated package\" but said \"there's little to love and even less fun to be had\". Kelvin Hayes from AllMusic dubbed it \"a disappointing debut from Ellis-Bextor, fusing Human League synth with beats and cinematic strings\", but described \"Murder on the Dancefloor\" as the \"shimmering highlight\" from the album. A critic from entertainment.ie said \"the material on her debut solo album only rarely does justice to her distinctive upper-crust voice\", and said that \"most of the songs sound laboured and plod where they should swing\". In contrast to the previous reviews, Andrew Arora from Blue Coupe had a more positive response to the record. Arora said \"it lands somewhere between Pet Shop Boys' synth-pop faculty and Blondie's Parallel Lines album\", although he claimed that fans of \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" \"should not expect much from this album, but it does deliver a dynamic electro disco sound that is sometimes analogous to her breakthrough-hit single\"."

        "content": "13 is the sixth studio album by English alternative rock band Blur, released on 15 March 1999. Continuing the stylistic shift away from the Britpop sound of the band's early career, 13 explores experimental, psychedelic and electronic music. Recording took place from June to October 1998 in London and Reykjav\u00edk. The album marks a departure of the band's longtime producer, Stephen Street, with his role being filled by William Orbit, who they had chosen after the release of the remix album, Bustin' + Dronin' (1998). Relationships between the band members were reported to be strained, with members frequently missing from the sessions. Lyrically, the album is significantly darker and more innovative than Blur's previous efforts, being heavily inspired by Damon Albarn's breakup with long-term girlfriend, Justine Frischmann, which followed an increasingly strained relationship. This album was the last in over a decade to feature the original line-up as Coxon left the band during the sessions of their next album Think Tank (2003), before returning for The Magic Whip (2015). 13 was released on 15 March 1999 and entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, making it Blur's fourth consecutive studio album to reach the top spot. The album was later certified Platinum. 13 also reached number one in Norway and charted within the top 20 in many other countries. The album produced three singles \u2013 \"Tender\", \"Coffee & TV\" and \"No Distance Left to Run\" \u2013 which charted at number 2, number 11 and number 14 respectively on the UK Singles Chart. 13 met with favourable reviews and received a nomination for the Mercury Prize, as well as for Best Album at the 2000 NME Awards."

        "content": "Blur's previous studio album, Blur (1997), had seen the band move away from the Britpop movement and take on a more alternative rock-influenced direction, primarily under the suggestion of guitarist Graham Coxon. The press and the industry had feared that the change in style would not be taken well with the public, and therefore the album would be commercially unsuccessful as a result. Despite these concerns, Blur was an unexpected success, particularly in America, where the album was certified Gold. However, the band still wanted to innovate, so they decided to embrace a different sound. Bassist Alex James stated, \"I think you just have to keep changing. That sort of thinking was, sort of, key.\" The band's leader Damon Albarn had been in a long-term relationship with Justine Frischmann, of the Britpop band Elastica. Their relationship was highly publicised, the couple being described by John Harris as \"proto-Posh and Becks for the indie-rock constituency.\" However, their relationship became strained over time, stated reasons including Albarn's desire to have children as well as Frischmann's continued friendship with ex-boyfriend Brett Anderson of Suede, who had shared a musical rivalry with Albarn. Albarn's lyrics and attitude had reflected this in the eyes of the other band members, with Coxon pointing out, \"I didn't have much of a clue that things were going wrong between Damon and Justine but it was probably easy to guess.\" After one last holiday together in Bali in late 1997 in an attempt to rekindle their relationship, the couple finally split. Albarn later commented, \"That relationship just absolutely crashed. I mean, it really was a spectacularly sad end.\" After his breakup, Albarn started sharing a flat with artist Jamie Hewlett whom he had met through Coxon. Around this time, Albarn had started to broaden his musical output. Whilst he was working on 13, there were various reports that he and Hewlett were working on a secret project, which turned out to be Gorillaz, a virtual band. Albarn also started working on film soundtracks, including Ravenous, Ordinary Decent Criminal and 101 Reykjav\u00edk."

Instead the band 'unanimously' decided that they wanted electronic music artist, William Orbit to produce the album after being impressed by his remix of their track, \"Movin' On\", included on the remix compilation, Bustin' + Dronin' (1998). Albarn commented that \"it was such a personal thing going on, we needed to have someone who didn't really know us\". He also described Orbit as being \"like a psychiatrist\". When asked if his replacement had come as a shock, Street stated, \"I just think they wanted to stretch out a bit more and, having made five albums with me, the best way to do that was to work with someone different who would approach the project in a different way. I understand that perfectly and certainly wasn't offended. I did five albums with the band and I must admit I thought each one would be the last because they were bound to want to try something new.\" Albarn described the decision to not work with Street as \"difficult\", going on to say \"he'll be forever part of what we are, and ironically, he gave us the tools we needed to go it alone.\" Tension in the studio ran high during the recording sessions. In Orbit's words, \"There was a battle between Damon's more experimental direction, and Graham's punk one, and Graham prevailed. If that tension had been growing on previous LPs, it came to a head here.\" \"Things were starting to fall apart between the four of us,\" drummer Dave Rowntree later revealed. \"It was quite a sad process making it. People were not turning up to the sessions, or turning up drunk, being abusive and storming off.\" \"I had songs,\" Alex James remarked. \"I played them to William. He liked them. But I was sulking. I didn't play them to the others\u2026 Now I know how George Harrison felt.\" Coxon admitted, \"I was really out there around 13, which made for some pretty great noise but I was probably a bit of a crap to be around.\" \"1992\" had originally been recorded as a demo in 1992 and was lost until Albarn found it again on a tape six years later. \"Mellow Song\" was demoed as a jam session known as \"Mellow Jam\" that was later included as the B-side of \"Tender\"."

Some of the songs, however, are evocative of songs from their previous efforts, such as \"Bugman\", \"Coffee & TV\" and \"1992\". The instrumental closer \"Optigan 1\" was created using an Optigan optical organ. The album is in the style of a loose concept album, much like other Blur albums, in this case about life and relationships. Much of the album was inspired by Albarn's breakup with Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. Two of the singles, \"Tender\" and \"No Distance Left to Run\", describe Albarn's love for Frischmann and his struggle to move on. The album features several short hidden tracks at the end of songs, stretching the playing time out; examples of this are \"Coffee & TV\", \"B.L.U.R.E.M.I.\", \"Battle\" and \"Caramel\", the latter of which features two hidden tracks. The album is named after the band's recording studio as well as the number of tracks on the album (bar the hidden tracks)."

In a more mixed assessment, Heather Phares of AllMusic felt that \"the group's ambitions to expand their musical and emotional horizons result in a half-baked baker's dozen of songs, featuring some of their most creative peaks and self-indulgent valleys.\" Keith Cameron of NME concluded that 13 was \"Blur's most inconsistent and infuriating statement thus far. Infuriating, because divested of four solid-gone clunkers 13 could pass muster as the best of Blur.\" Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention rating, indicating \"an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure\", and remarked that \"halfway there, it sits down in the middle of the road and won't budge.\" The music video for the hit single \"Coffee & TV\" cemented Blur's reputation as a cult band in the US with its protagonist Milky. The video gained heavy airplay on many modern rock channels in America."

Therefore, it became a communist paper despite its socialist origin. The PCF has published it ever since. The PCF owns 40 per cent of the paper with the remaining shares held by staff, readers and \"friends\" of the paper. The paper is also sustained by the annual F\u00eate de l'Humanit\u00e9, held in the working class suburbs of Paris, at Le Bourget, near Aubervilliers, and to a lesser extent elsewhere in the country. The fortunes of L'Humanit\u00e9 have fluctuated with those of the PCF. During the 1920s, when the PCF was politically isolated, it was kept in existence only by donations from Party members. Louis Aragon started to write for L'Humanit\u00e9 in 1933, in the \"news in brief\" section. He later led Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises, the paper's weekly literary supplement. With the formation of the Popular Front in 1936, L'Humanit\u00e9 's circulation and status increased, and many leading French intellectuals wrote for it. L'Humanit\u00e9 was banned during World War II but published clandestinely until liberation of Paris from German occupation."

TF1 said its motive was \"maintenance of media diversity.\" Despite the irony of a communist newspaper being rescued by private capital, some of which supported right-wing politics, L'Humanit\u00e9 director Patrick Le Hyaric described the sale as \"a matter of life or death.\" Since 2001, there has been speculation that L'Humanit\u00e9 would cease as a daily newspaper.

        "content": "Tencent QQ was first released in China in February 1999 under the name of OICQ (\"Open ICQ\", a reference to the early IM service ICQ). After the threat of a trademark infringement lawsuit by the AOL-owned ICQ, the product's name was changed to QQ (with \"Q\" and \"QQ\" used to imply \"cute\"). The software inherited existing functions from ICQ, and additional features such as software skins, people's images, and emoticons.  QQ was first released as a \"network paging\" real-time communications service. Other features were later added, such as chatrooms, games, personal avatars (similar to \"Meego\" in MSN), online storage, and Internet dating services. The official client runs on Microsoft Windows and a beta public version was launched for Mac OS X version 10.4.9 or newer. Formerly, two web versions, WebQQ (full version) and WebQQ Mini (Lite version), which made use of Ajax, were available. Development, support, and availability of WebQQ Mini, however, has since been discontinued. On 31 July 2008, Tencent released an official client for Linux, but this has not been made compatible with the Windows version and it is not capable of voice chat. In response to competition with other instant messengers, such as Windows Live Messenger, Tencent released Tencent Messenger, which is aimed at businesses. Tencent QQ holds the Guinness World Record for the highest number of simultaneous online users on an instant messaging program with 210,212,085 users online on July 3, 2014."

In 1995, the registered QQ accounts had only 5 digits, while currently, the digital numbers used for QQ accounts has reached 12. The first QQ number is held by Ma Huateng and his account number is 10001. The membership of a QQ account normally lasts for a month. When this membership is overdue and has not been renewed, the said account will be deactivated. In relation to calculating \"QQ Age\", being logged in for 2 full hours would be considered as one full day. Thus, being logged in to QQ for around 700 hours would make the age increase by 1 year. In the 2012 version of QQ, users can see the age on the personal information page. In 2004, Tencent launched QQ hierarchy which shows the level of a registered member. At the very beginning, this hierarchy was solely based on the hours a member spent in QQ. Hence, the longer the member stayed, the higher level he can aim.  These results, however, were criticized as people tend to waste electrical energy due to longer hours of stay on the site. Therefore, Tencent changed the basis from an hour unit to a daily unit due to the involvement of several departments."

The songs were written by vocalist Mark Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene and the album was compiled from a lengthy recording process at London's Wessex Studios between 1987 and 1988. Often working in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances that drew on elements of jazz, ambient, blues, classical music, and dub. These long-form recordings were then heavily edited and re-arranged into an album in mostly digital format. Spirit of Eden was a radical departure from Talk Talk's earlier and more accessible albums. Compared to the success of 1986's The Colour of Spring, it was a commercial disappointment. Despite its mixed reception, the album's stature grew more favourable in subsequent years, with contemporary critics describing Spirit of Eden as an early progenitor of the post-rock genre. In 2013, NME ranked it at number 95 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time."

        "content": "Talk Talk, led by singer Mark Hollis, formed in England in the early 1980s. From the start, Hollis cited jazz and impressionist artists like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Claude Debussy as major influences, but the first two Talk Talk albums, The Party's Over (1982) and It's My Life (1984), did not readily reflect such influences; critics compared the band to contemporary new wave groups, especially Duran Duran. Hollis partly attributed the shortcomings of their early music to a financial need to use synthesizers in place of acoustic instruments. Although critics did not favour the band's early output, the first two albums were commercially successful in Europe. This gave Talk Talk the money needed to hire additional musicians to play on their next album, The Colour of Spring (1986). The band no longer had to rely on synthesizers. Instead, musicians improvised with their instruments for many hours, then Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene edited and arranged the performances to get the sound they wanted. A total of sixteen musicians appeared on the album around the core of Hollis and Friese-Green. The Colour of Spring became Talk Talk's most successful album, selling over two million copies and prompting a major world tour. At the same time, minimalist songs like \"April 5th,\" \"Chameleon Day,\" and the B-side \"It's Getting Late in the Evening\" pointed towards the band's next direction."

Recording for Spirit of Eden began in 1987 at Wessex Studios, London and took about a year to complete. The sessions took place in a blacked-out studio, with an oil projector and strobe lighting. Engineer Phill Brown said that the album, along with its successor, was \"recorded by chance, accident, and hours of trying every possible overdub idea.\" According to Brown, \"twelve hours a day in the dark listening to the same six songs for eight months became pretty intense. There was very little communication with musicians who came in to play. They were led to a studio in darkness and a track would be played down the headphones.\""

Although the album is noted for its tranquil soundscapes, Graham Sutton of Bark Psychosis notes \"Noise is important. I could never understand people I knew who liked Talk Talk and saw it as something 'nice to chill out to' when I loved the overwhelming intensity and the dynamics.\" Mark Hollis' lyrics reflect his religious and spiritual outlook. Though he acknowledges that his lyrics are religious, he says they are not based on a specific creed, preferring to think of them as \"humanitarian.\" \"I Believe in You\" has been described as an \"anti-heroin song.\" When asked whether the lyrics are based on personal experience, Hollis replied, \"No, not at all.

After listening to the cassette, EMI representatives doubted that it could be commercially successful. They asked Hollis to re-record a song or replace material, but he refused to do so. By the time the masters were delivered later in the month, however, the label conceded that the album had been satisfactorily completed. Despite their reservations towards Spirit of Eden, EMI chose to exercise their option to extend the recording contract. The band, however, wanted out of the contract. \"I knew by that time that EMI was not the company this band should be with,\" manager Keith Aspden told Mojo. \"I was fearful that the money wouldn't be there to record another album.\" EMI and Talk Talk went to court to decide the issue. The case centred on whether EMI had notified the band in time about the contract extension. As part of the agreement, EMI had to send a written notice within three months after the completion of Spirit of Eden. The band said that EMI had sent the notice too late, arguing that the three-month period began once recording had finished; EMI argued that the three-month period did not begin until they were satisfied with the recording, on the basis that the definition of an \"album\" in the contract provided that the album had to be \"commercially satisfactory\". The band disputed this, particularly on the basis that there were no changes made to the album in the space between its recording and eventual release. Justice Andrew Morritt ruled in favour of EMI, but his decision was overturned in the Court of Appeal. Talk Talk were released from the contract and later signed to Polydor."

They're not so much difficult as not obvious. You've just got to find as many ways as possible to expose the music.\" Evaluating some masterpieces of the eighties in a 2004 article for The Guardian, John Robinson calls Spirit of Eden, like David Sylvian's Brilliant Trees, \"triumphant, [but] completely unmarketable.\" Although the band did not originally plan to release a single, EMI issued a radio edit of \"I Believe in You\" in September 1988 (the previously unreleased \"John Cope\" was included as the B-side). The single failed to breach the UK Singles Chart Top 75. Around November, Tim Pope directed a music video for \"I Believe in You\", featuring Hollis sitting with his guitar, singing the lyrics. \"That was a massive mistake,\" said Hollis. \"I thought just by sitting there and listening and really thinking about what it was about, I could get that in my eyes. But you cannot do it. It just feels stupid.\" The band did not tour in support of the album. Hollis explained, \"There is no way that I could ever play again a lot of the stuff I played on this album because I just wouldn't know how to. So, to play it live, to take a part that was done in spontaneity, to write it down and then get someone to play it, would lose the whole point, lose the whole purity of what it was in the first place.\" The band would never tour again. Spirit of Eden was released worldwide in 1988. It did not enjoy nearly as much commercial success as The Colour of Spring. The album spent five weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at #19. The album cover depicts a tree festooned with seashells, snails, birds, and insects. It was illustrated by James Marsh, who did Talk Talk's artwork throughout their recording career. The booklet provides reproductions of Hollis' handwritten lyrics. The album was digitally remastered by Phill Brown and Denis Blackham in 1997."

Marcus Berkmann of The Spectator in a 2001 retrospective felt that the album was \"almost wilfully obscure\", with a musical style close to free-form jazz that was too far removed from The Colour of Spring for fans to enjoy. Roy Wilkinson of Sounds wrote that the band had \"evolved into contemplative muso-techs\", and while their lyrics were a weak point and the second side did not fully work, the first side achieved \"magnificence\". In the 1992 Rolling Stone Album Guide, J. D. Considine rated the album 1 star out of 5: \"Instead of getting better or worse, this band simply grew more pretentious with each passing year ... by Spirit of Eden, Mark Hollis's Pete Townshend-on-Dramamine vocals have been pushed aside by the band's pointless noodling.\" Simon Williams of NME found the album 'aimless' but admitted \"they're resolute and determined, flaunting commercial rules with fascinating disregard for understanding or acceptance.\" A review in Q criticised the band for not attempting to create more commercial music, but concluded that \"If Spirit of Eden often recalls the pastoral epics of the early 70s, it has a range, ambition and self-sufficiency that enables Hollis and co to step out of time and into their own.\""

In a review of Bark Psychosis' album Hex, where the term \"post-rock\" was coined, Simon Reynolds opined that Hex aspires to the \"baroque grandeur\" of Spirit of Eden. Andy Whitman of Paste magazine argues that Spirit of Eden represents the beginning of post-rock: \"The telltale marks of the genre\u2014textured guitars, glacial tempos, an emphasis on dynamics, electronica, ambience and minimalism\u2014were all in place, and paved the way for bands like Sigur R\u00f3s, Mogwai, Godspeed You!

In 2008 Alan McGee wrote: \"Spirit of Eden has not dated; it's remarkable how contemporary it sounds, anticipating post-rock, The Verve and Radiohead.

It also yielded the band's first top-ten single, with \"Time Is Running Out\" peaking at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2009, it was voted by Kerrang! as the second-best album of the 21st century thus far. As of 2018, Absolution has sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide."

        "content": "The band spent much of 2002 recording Absolution with producer Rich Costey. The album was recorded in studios in both Los Angeles and London. Bellamy said that the band made a \"conscious decision\" to \"get together in a room and make music\", setting aside time to record the album, as previous albums' recording sessions were 'hastily arranged' and rushed. Absolution is an alternative rock, progressive rock, hard rock, and art rock album. It establishes some of the musical and lyrical themes which would later become Muse's trademarks, such as symphonic rock influences on \"Butterflies and Hurricanes\", orchestral music influences on \"Blackout\" and electronic music influences on \"Endlessly\". Lyrically, the album incorporates themes of fear, mistrust, personal achievement and joy, and a general theme of \"things coming to an end\". Bellamy said that the beginning of the Iraq War had an effect on their songwriting. These musical influences and lyrical themes were relatively new to Muse's sound and would be further explored on their following albums, in particular their fifth studio album The Resistance. The B-side and bonus track \"Fury\" and future Black Holes and Revelations track \"Soldier's Poem\" were among discarded material written during the Absolution sessions, with \"Fury\" being dropped in favour of \"The Small Print\" due to Chris Wolstenholme and Dominic Howard's preference to the latter song, despite frontman Matt Bellamy intending to include the former on the album's track listing. The track \"Blackout\" featured an 18-piece orchestra."

I think it's just suggesting that the act of making music is a way of understanding things.\" Absolution was one of two Muse albums (alongside Black Holes and Revelations) to feature artwork by Storm Thorgerson. The ambiguous falling/floating image was inspired by the Ren\u00e9 Magritte painting Golconda. According to Dominic Howard, \"The artwork can either be seen as people coming down to Earth or leaving the Earth, it's open to interpretation\". The special edition and vinyl pressing artworks slightly differ. The special edition features a different man in a different angle, while the vinyl pressing features a little girl, instead."

Tyler Fisher of Sputnikmusic hailed Absolution as Muse's most consistent album to date and felt that the album had perfected the sound of the band's previous releases, writing that it \"expands on newer sounds and improves on others.\" Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote: \"Muse sound like a band who are at the top of their game. Their confidence carries you through the album's excesses.\" Rob Kemp of Rolling Stone was less enthusiastic, drawing Radiohead comparisons but concluding that Matt Bellamy \"doesn't bring as much ingenuity to his singing.\" In 2005, Absolution was ranked number 345 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time. The album was placed in at No. 23 after a public vote for Q in February 2008 for the Best British Albums of All Time."

Released in August 1983, it is the only album the group recorded with lead vocalist Ian Gillan, best known for his work with Deep Purple. It was also the last Black Sabbath album for nine years to feature original bassist Geezer Butler and the last to feature original drummer Bill Ward, though Ward did record a studio track with the band fifteen years later on their 1998 live album Reunion. The album has received mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success upon its 1983 release, reaching No. 4 in the UK charts. The album also hit the top 40 in the United States. In July 2021, guitarist and founding member Tony Iommi confirmed that the long lost original master tapes of the album had been finally located, and that he was considering remixing the album for a future re-release."

        "content": "Following the departure of vocalist Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice in 1982, Sabbath's future was in doubt. The band switched management to Don Arden (Sharon Osbourne's father) and he suggested Ian Gillan as the new vocalist. \"That band was put together on paper,\" guitarist Tony Iommi revealed in the 1992 documentary Black Sabbath: 1978\u20131992. \"We'd never rehearsed.\" The band had considered vocalists such as Robert Plant and David Coverdale before settling on Gillan. They even received an audition tape from a then-unknown Michael Bolton. Iommi told Hit Parader magazine in late 1983 that Gillan was the best candidate, saying \"His shriek is legendary.\" Gillan was at first reluctant, but his manager convinced him to meet with Iommi and Butler at The Bear, a pub in Oxford. After a night of heavy drinking, Gillan officially committed to the project in February 1983. The project was originally intended to be a new supergroup, and the members of the group had no intention of billing themselves as Black Sabbath. At some point after recording had been completed, Arden insisted that they use the recognizable Sabbath name, and the members were overruled. \"We thought we were doing a kind of Gillan-Iommi-Butler-Ward album\u2026\" recalled bassist Geezer Butler. \"That is the way we approached the album. When we had finished the album, we took it to the record company and they said, 'Well, here's the contract: it is going to go out as a Black Sabbath album.\" Born Again featured the return of founding member Bill Ward on drums, who was newly sober after leaving the band in 1980 to deal with his alcoholism. Ward began drinking again near the end of the sessions and returned to Los Angeles for treatment once the album was completed, and has remained sober ever since. Ward has said that he enjoyed making the album, which remains his final studio album with the band."

        "content": "Sabbath began recording in May 1983 at Richard Branson's Manor Studio, in the Oxfordshire countryside. Producer Robin Black had worked with the band in the mid-1970s, as engineer on Sabotage. In his autobiography, Iommi recounts Gillan informing him that, during sessions, he planned to live outside the house in a marquee tent: \"I thought he was joking, but when I arrived at the Manor I saw this marquee outside and I thought, fucking hell, he's serious. Ian had put up this big, huge tent. It had a cooking area and a bedroom and whatever else.\"  Gillan brought an immediacy to the songwriting that was uncommon for Sabbath: \"Ian's lyrics were about sexual things or true facts, even about stuff that happened at The Manor there and then,\" Iommi recalls in his memoir. \"They were good, but quite a departure from Geezer's and Ronnie's lyrics.\" For example, Gillan returned from a local pub one evening, took a car belonging to drummer Ward, and commenced racing around a go-cart track on the Manor Studio property. He crashed the car, which burst into flames after he escaped uninjured. He wrote the album's opening \"Trashed\" about the experience. \"Disturbing the Priest\" was written after a rehearsal space \u2013 set up by Iommi in a small building near a local church \u2013 received noise complaints from the resident priests. \"We wanted this effect on 'Disturbing the Priest',\" recalled the guitarist, \"and Bill got this big bucket of water and he got this anvil. It was really heavy, and he'd got it hanging on a piece of rope and lower it in to get this effect: hit it and lower it in, and then lift it out again. It was a great effect, but it took hours to do.\" \"I did some of the best drum work on that album\u2026\" Bill Ward recalled. \"On 'Disturbing the Priest', there were some polyrhythms and some counterpoint things that I was doing, and I was using at least twenty different pieces of percussion towards the end of that song\u2026 I was real proud of a lot of the work that I did. Some of it invariably got lost in the mix, but I know that it's printed on those tracks.\" The band got along well, but it became apparent to all involved that Gillan's style did not quite mesh with the Sabbath sound. In 1992, he told director Martin Baker, \"I was the worst singer Black Sabbath ever had. It was totally, totally incompatible with any music they'd ever done. I didn't wear leathers, I wasn't of that image...I think the fans probably were in a total state of confusion.\" In 1992, Iommi admitted to Guitar World, \"Ian is a great singer, but he's from a completely different background, and it was difficult for him to come in and sing Sabbath material.\" \"I saw Ian go into the studio one day,\" Ward recalled, \"and I was fortunate and honoured, actually, to be part of a session. I watched him lay tracks on 'Keep It Warm'\u2026 I felt like Ian was Ian in that song\u2026 I watched this incredible transformation of this man that really, I felt, delicately put lyrics together. It made sense. I thought he did an excellent job. And I really dig that song too.\" When the band heard the final product, they were horrified at the muffled mix. In his autobiography, Iommi explains that Gillan inadvertently blew a couple of tweeters in the studio speakers by playing the backing tracks too loud and nobody noticed.  \"We just thought it was a bit of a funny sound, but it went very wrong somewhere between the mix and the mastering and the pressing of that album...the sound was really dull and muffly.  I didn't know about it, because we were already out on tour in Europe.  By the time we heard the album, it was out and in the charts, but the sound was awful.\" For all his misgivings, Gillan remembers the period fondly, stating in the Black Sabbath: 1978\u20131992 documentary, \"But by God, we had a good year...And the songs, I think, were quite good.\""

The tour was also a breaking point for Butler, who admits in the Black Sabbath: 1978\u20131992 documentary, \"I just got totally disillusioned with the whole thing and I left some time in 1984 after the Born Again tour. I just had enough of it.\" In 2015 Butler clarified to Dave Everley of Classic Rock: \"I left because my second child was born and he was having problems, so I wanted to stay with him. I told Tony I couldn't concentrate on the band anymore. But I never fell out with anybody.\" Butler says the looming Deep Purple reunion played a large role in Gillan's decision to leave. Disagreements with management also contributed to the band's dissolution. Bevan would briefly return to the Sabbath fold in 1986-87 to record cymbal overdubs for the album The Eternal Idol."

It is based on a black-and-white photocopy of a photograph published in a 1968 magazine. The same photograph was used for 12-inch versions of Depeche Mode's \"New Life\". \"I didn't have any participation in the album cover,\" recalled Bill Ward. \"When I saw it, I hated it.\" Ian Gillan told the press that he vomited when he first saw the picture. However, Tony Iommi approved the cover, which has been considered one of the worst ever. Ben Mitchell of Blender called the cover \"awful\". The British magazine, Kerrang!, ranked the cover in second place, behind only the Scorpions' Lovedrive, on their list of \"10 Worst Album Sleeves in Metal/Hard Rock\". The list was based on votes from the magazine's readers. NME included the sleeve on their list of the \"29 sickest album covers ever\". Sabbath's manager Don Arden was quite hostile towards the band's ex-vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, who had recently married his manager Sharon, and was fond of telling Osbourne that his children resembled the Born Again cover."

It was the highest charting Black Sabbath album in the United Kingdom since Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973) and became an American Top 40 hit. Despite this, it became the first Black Sabbath album to not have any RIAA certification in the US. The album received mixed reviews upon its release. AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote that the album has \"gone down as one of heavy metal's all-time greatest disappointments\" and described \"Zero the Hero\", \"Hot Line\", and \"Keep It Warm\" as \"embarrassing\". Blender contributor Ben Mitchell gave the album one out of five stars and claimed that the music on Born Again was worse than its cover. Martin Charles Strong, the author of The Essential Rock Discography, wrote that it was \"an exercise in heavy-metal clich\u00e9\". However, Popmatters contributor Adrien Begrand has noted the album as \"overlooked\". The British magazine Metal Forces defined it \"a very good album\" even if \"Gillan may not be the perfect frontman for the Sabs\". Despite the overall negative reception with critics, the album remains a fan favorite. Author Martin Popoff has written that \"if any album in the history of Black Sabbath is getting a new set of horns up from metalheads here deep into the new century, it's Born Again.\" Industrial metal band Godflesh and death metal band Cannibal Corpse both have covered \"Zero the Hero\", the former appears on the Masters Of Misery - Black Sabbath: The Earache Tribute album while the latter is featured on the Hammer Smashed Face EP. Cannbibal Corpse's former singer, Chris Barnes, has called Born Again his favourite Black Sabbath album. \"Zero the Hero\" has also been cited as the inspiration for the Guns N' Roses hit \"Paradise City\", and in his autobiography Iommi also suggests the Beastie Boys may have borrowed the riff from \"Hot Line\" for their hit \"(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party!)\".  Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich has called Born Again \"one of the best Black Sabbath albums\". Bill Stevenson, former drummer of Black Flag, stated the band was listening to the album around the time of My War, defining songs like \"Trashed\" and \"Disturbing the Priest\" as \"ideal\". In 1984, Ozzy Osbourne stated that the album was the \"best thing I've heard from Sabbath since the original group broke up\". Butler has pointed to \"Zero the Hero\" and \"Disturbing the Priest\" as his favorites on the album. In 1992 Iommi confessed to Guitar World, \"To be honest, I didn't like some of the songs on that album, and the production was awful. We never had time to test the pressings after it was recorded, and something happened to it by the time it got released.\" A re-mastered 'Deluxe Expanded Edition' of Born Again was released in May 2011 by Sanctuary Records. It included several live tracks from the 1983 Reading Festival originally featured on BBC Radio 1's Friday Rock Show. Though the release was remastered, it was not remixed due to the inability to locate the original master tapes, as well as Sanctuary not wanting delay the release in an effort to locate said tapes for a remix. In 2021, Tony Iommi claimed that the original master tapes, long thought lost, had been found and that he was considering remixing them for an eventual release."

        "content": "According to Iommi's autobiography, Ward began drinking again near the end of the Born Again recording sessions and returned to Los Angeles for treatment.  The band recruited Bev Bevan, who had played with The Move and ELO, for the upcoming tour in support of the new album.  Gillan had all the lyrics to the Sabbath songs written out and plastered all over the stage, explaining to Martin Baker in 1992, \"I couldn't get into my brain any of these lyrics...I cannot soak in these words.  There's no storyline. I can't relate to what they mean.\"  Gillan attempted to overcome the problem by having a cue book with plastic pages on stage, which he would turn with his foot during the show.  However, Gillan did not anticipate the \"six buckets\" of dry ice that engulfed the stage, making it impossible for the singer to see the lyric sheets.  \"Ian wasn't very sure-footed either,\" Iommi writes in his memoir.  \"He once fell over my pedal board.  He was waving at the people, stepped back and, bang!, he went arse over head big time.\"  Gillan also told Birch that it was Don Arden's idea to open the show with a crying baby blaring over the speakers and a dwarf made to look exactly like the demonic baby depicted on the Born Again album cover miming to the screaming.  \"We noticed a dwarf walking around the day before the opening show...And we're saying to Don, 'We think this is in the worst possible taste, this dwarf, you know?'  And Don's going, 'Nah, the kids will love it, it'll be great.'\" The tour is most infamous, however, for the gigantic Stonehenge props the band used.  Iommi recalls in his autobiography that it was Butler's idea but the designers took his measurements the wrong way and thought it was meant to be life-size.  Months later, while rehearsing for the tour at the Birmingham NEC, the stage set arrived.  \"We were in shock,\" writes Iommi.  \"This stuff was coming in and in and in.  It had all these huge columns in the back that were as wide as your average bedroom, the columns in front were about 13 feet high, and we had all the monitors and the side fills as well as all this rock.  It was made of fiberglass and wood, and bloody heavy.\" The set would be lampooned in Rob Reiner's 1984 rock music mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, with the band having the opposite problem of having to use miniature Stonehenge stage props.  Butler has said that he told the associate scriptwriter of the film the story of the band's performances with their \"Stonehenge\" stage props. In an interview for the documentary Black Sabbath: 1978\u20131992, Gillan claims Don Arden had the dwarf walk across the top of the Stonehenge props at the start of the show and, as the tape of the screaming baby faded away, fall back \"from about thirty-five feet in the air on this big pile of mattresses.  And then, 'Dong!' The bells start and the monks come out, the whole thing.  Pure Spinal Tap.\"  The band toured Europe first, playing the Reading Festival (a performance that is included on the 2011 deluxe edition of Born Again) and also playing in a bullring in Barcelona in September.  Sabbath performed Gillan's hit with Deep Purple, \"Smoke on the Water\", on the tour, with Iommi explaining in his memoir, \"it seemed like a bum deal for him not to do any of his stuff while he was doing all of ours.  I don't know if we played it properly but the audience loved it.  The critics moaned; it was something out of the bag and they didn't want to know then.\"  In October, the band took the Stonehenge set to America but could only use a portion of it at most gigs because the columns were too high. The set was eventually abandoned.  A music video for \"Zero the Hero\" was also released, featuring performance footage of the band onstage interspersed with scenes involving several grotesque characters performing experiments on a witless young man in a haunted house filled with rats, roosters and a roaming horse."

        "content": "Spanish names typically consist of a given name (simple or composite) followed by two surnames. Historically, the first surname was the father's first surname, and the second the mother's first surname. In recent years in Spain, the order of the surnames in a family is decided when registering the first child, but the traditional order is nearly universally chosen (99.53% of the time). Often, the practice is to use one given name and the first surname most of the time (e.g. \"Miguel de Unamuno\" for Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo); the complete name is typically reserved for legal, formal, and documentary matters. Both surnames are sometimes systematically used when the first surname is very common (e.g., Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Pablo Ruiz Picasso or Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero) to get a more customized name. In these cases, it is even common to use only the second surname, as in \"Lorca\", \"Picasso\" or \"Zapatero\". This does not affect alphabetization: \"Lorca\", the Spanish poet, must be alphabetized in an index under \"Garc\u00eda Lorca\", not \"Lorca\" or \"Garc\u00eda\"."

        "title": "Spanish naming customs_Basic structure",
        "content": "Currently in Spain, people bear a single or composite given name (nombre in Spanish) and two surnames (apellidos in Spanish). A composite given name comprises two (or more) single names; for example Juan Pablo is considered not to be a first and a second forename, but a single composite forename. The two surnames refer to each of the parental families. Traditionally, a person's first surname is the father's first surname (apellido paterno), while their second surname is the mother's first surname (apellido materno). For example, if a man named Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez Garrido marries a woman named Mar\u00eda Dolores Mart\u00ednez Ruiz (note that women do not change their name with marriage) and they have a child named Jos\u00e9, there are several legal options, but their child would most usually be known as Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez. Spanish gender equality law has allowed surname transposition since 1999, subject to the condition that every sibling must bear the same surname order recorded in the Registro Civil (civil registry), but there have been legal exceptions. Since 2013, if the parents of a child were unable to agree on the order of surnames, an official would decide which is to come first, with the paternal name being the default option. The only requirement is that every son and daughter must have the same order of the surnames, so they cannot change it separately. Since June 2017, adopting the paternal name first is no longer the standard method, and parents are required to sign an agreement wherein the name order is expressed explicitly. The law also grants a person the option, upon reaching adulthood, of reversing the order of their surnames. However, this legislation only applies to Spanish citizens; people of other nationalities are issued the surname indicated by the laws of their original country. Each surname can also be composite, with the parts usually linked by the conjunction y or e (and), by the preposition de (of), or by a hyphen. For example, a person's name might be Juan Pablo Fern\u00e1ndez de Calder\u00f3n Garc\u00eda-Iglesias, consisting of a forename (Juan Pablo), a paternal surname (Fern\u00e1ndez de Calder\u00f3n), and a maternal surname (Garc\u00eda-Iglesias). There are times when it is impossible, by inspection of a name, to correctly analyse it. For example, the writer Sebasti\u00e0 Juan Arb\u00f3 was alphabetised by the Library of Congress for many years under \"Arb\u00f3\", assuming that Sebasti\u00e0 and Juan were both given names. However, \"Juan\" was actually his first surname. Resolving questions like this, which typically involve very common names (\"Juan\" is rarely a surname), often requires the consultation of the person involved or legal documents pertaining to them."

For example, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero (elected President of the Spanish Government in the 2004 and 2008 general elections) is often called simply Zapatero, the name he inherited from his mother's family since Rodr\u00edguez is a common surname and may be ambiguous. The same occurs with another former Spanish Socialist leader, Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba, with the poet and dramatist Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, and with the painter Pablo Ruiz Picasso. As these people's paternal surnames are very common, they are often referred to by their maternal surnames (Rubalcaba, Lorca, Picasso). It would nonetheless be a mistake to index Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero under Z or Garc\u00eda Lorca under L. (Picasso, who spent most of his adult life in France, is normally indexed under \"P\".) In an English-speaking environment, Spanish-named people sometimes hyphenate their surnames to avoid Anglophone confusion or to fill in forms with only one space provided for the last name: for example, U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is of Puerto Rican heritage, is named \"Ocasio-Cortez\" because her parents' surnames are Ocasio-Roman and Ocasio-Cortez (n\u00e9e Cortez). She has publicly corrected people who referred to her as \"Cortez\" rather than \"Ocasio-Cortez.\""

In daily life, such women omit the \"Mary of the\u00a0...\" nominal prefix, and use the suffix portion of their composite names as their public, rather than legal, identity. Hence, women with Marian names such as Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles (Mary of the Angels), Mar\u00eda del Pilar (Mary of the Pillar), and Mar\u00eda de la Luz (Mary of the Light), are normally addressed as \u00c1ngeles (Angels), Pilar (Pillar), and Luz (Light); however, each might be addressed as Mar\u00eda.

        "content": "In the generational transmission of surnames, the paternal surname's precedence eventually eliminates the maternal surnames from the family lineage. Contemporary law (1999) allows the maternal surname to be given precedence, but most people observe the traditional paternal\u2013maternal surname order. Therefore, the daughter and son of \u00c1ngela L\u00f3pez S\u00e1enz and Tom\u00e1s Portillo Blanco are usually called Laura Portillo L\u00f3pez and Pedro Portillo L\u00f3pez but could also be called Laura L\u00f3pez Portillo and Pedro L\u00f3pez Portillo. The two surnames of all siblings must be in the same order when recorded in the Registro Civil. Patrilineal surname transmission was not always the norm in Spanish-speaking societies. Prior to the mid-eighteenth century, when the current paternal-maternal surname combination norm was adopted, Hispanophone societies often practiced matrilineal surname transmission, giving children the maternal surname and occasionally giving children a grandparent's surname (borne by neither parent) for prestige \u2013 being perceived as gentry \u2013 and profit, flattering the matriarch or the patriarch in hope of inheriting land. Spanish naming customs include the orthographic option of conjoining the surnames with the conjunction particle y, or e before a name starting with 'I', 'Hi' or 'Y', (both meaning \"and\") (e.g., Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset, Tom\u00e1s Portillo y Blanco, or Eduardo Dato e Iradier), following an antiquated aristocratic usage. Not every surname is a single word; such conjoining usage is common with doubled surnames (maternal-paternal), ancestral composite surnames bequeathed to the following generations \u2013 especially when the paternal surname is socially undistinguished. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez del Manzano y L\u00f3pez del Hierro is an example, his name comprising the composite single name Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda and two composite surnames, \u00c1lvarez del Manzano and L\u00f3pez del Hierro. Other examples derive from church place-names such as San Jos\u00e9. When a person bears doubled surnames, the means of disambiguation is to insert y between the paternal and maternal surnames. In case of illegitimacy \u2013 when the child's father either is unknown or refuses to recognize his child legally \u2013 the child bears both of the mother's surnames, which may be interchanged. Occasionally, a person with a common paternal surname and an uncommon maternal surname becomes widely known by the maternal surname. Some examples include the artist Pablo Ruiz Picasso, the poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, and the politician Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero. With a similar effect, the foreign paternal surname of the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Hughes Galeano (his father was British) is usually omitted. (As a boy, however, he occasionally signed his name as Eduardo Gius, using a Hispanicised approximation of the English pronunciation of \"Hughes\".) Such use of the second last name by itself is colloquial, however, and may not be applied in legal contexts. Also rarely, a person may become widely known by both surnames, with an example being a tennis player Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario \u2013 whereas her older brothers Emilio and Javier, also professional tennis players, are mainly known only by the paternal surname of S\u00e1nchez in everyday life, although they would formally be addressed as S\u00e1nchez Vicario."

Thus the Romance patronymic and the place-name are conjoined with the prepositional particle de (\"from\"+\"provenance\"). For example, in the name Jos\u00e9 Ignacio L\u00f3pez de Arriort\u00faa, the composite surname L\u00f3pez de Arriort\u00faa is a single surname, despite Arriort\u00faa being the original family name. This can lead to confusion because the Spanish L\u00f3pez and the Basque Arriort\u00faa are discrete surnames in Spanish and Basque respectively. This pattern was also in use in other Basque districts, but was phased out in most of the Basque-speaking areas and only remained in place across lands of heavy Romance influence, i.e. some central areas of Navarre and most of \u00c1lava. To a lesser extent, this pattern has been also present in Castile, where Basque-Castilian bilingualism was common in northern and eastern areas up to the 13th century. A notable example of this system was Joaquina S\u00e1nchez de Samaniego y Fern\u00e1ndez de Tejada, with both paternal and maternal surnames coming from this system, joined with a y (\"and\")."

        "content": "In Spanish, the preposition particle de (\"of\") is used as a conjunction in two surname spelling styles, and to disambiguate a surname. The first style is in patronymic and toponymic surname spelling formul\u00e6, e.g. Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, Pedro L\u00f3pez de Ayala, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa, as in many conquistador names. The spellings of surnames containing the prepositional particle de are written in lower-case when they follow the name, thus Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la R\u00faa (\"of the street\") and Cunegunda de la Torre (\"of the tower\"), otherwise the upper-case spellings doctor De la R\u00faa and se\u00f1ora De la Torre are used. Without a patronymic Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n. Unlike in French, Spanish orthography does not require a contraction when a vowel begins the surname, with the exception de el (\"of the\"), which becomes del. E.g. Carlos Arturo del Monte (Charles Arthur of the Mountain). The patronymic exception The current (1958) Spanish name law, Art\u00edculo 195 del Reglamento del Registro Civil (Article 195 of the Civil Registry Regulations) does not allow a person to prefix de to their surname, except as the clarifying addition of de to a surname (apellido) that might be misunderstood as a forename (nombre); thus, a child would be registered as Pedro de Miguel Jim\u00e9nez, to avoid the surname Miguel being mistaken as the second part of a composite name, as Pedro Miguel. Bearing the de particle does not necessarily denote a noble family, especially in eastern Castile, Alava, and western Navarre, the de usually applied to the place-name (town or village) from which the person and his or her ancestors originated. This differs from another practice established in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, i.e. the usage of de following the one's own name as a way of denoting the bearer's noble heritage to avoid the misperception that he or she is either a Jew or a Moor. In that time, many people, regardless of their true origins, used the particle, e.g. Miguel de Cervantes, Lope de Vega, etc.; moreover, following that fashion a high noble such as Francisco Sandoval Rojas called himself Francisco de Sandoval y Rojas. During the eighteenth century, the Spanish nobility fully embraced the French custom of using de as a nobility identifier, however, commoners also bore the de particle, which made the de usages unclear; thus, nobility was emphasised with the surname's lineage."

        "content": "In the sixteenth century, the Spanish adopted the copulative conjunction y (\"and\") to distinguish a person's surnames; thus the Andalusian Baroque writer Luis de G\u00f3ngora y Argote (1561\u20131627), the Aragonese painter Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Goya y Lucientes (1746\u20131828), the Andalusian artist Pablo Diego Ruiz y Picasso (1881\u20131973), and the Madrilenian liberal philosopher Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset (1883\u20131955). In Hispanic America, this spelling convention was common to clergymen (e.g. Salvadoran Bishop \u00d3scar Arnulfo Romero y Gald\u00e1mez), and sanctioned by the Ley de Registro Civil (Civil Registry Law) of 1870, requiring birth certificates indicating the paternal and maternal surnames conjoined with y \u2013 thus, Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez y M\u00e1rquez and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar y L\u00f3pez are the respective true names of the Spanish politicians Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez M\u00e1rquez and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar L\u00f3pez; however, unlike in Catalan, the Spanish usage is infrequent. In the Philippines, y and its associated usages are retained only in formal state documents such as police records, but is otherwise dropped in favour of a more American-influenced naming order. The conjunction y avoids denominational confusion when the paternal surname might appear to be a (first) name: without it, the physiologist Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal might appear to be named Santiago Ram\u00f3n (composite) and surnamed Cajal, likewise the jurist Francisco Tom\u00e1s y Valiente, and the cleric Vicente Enrique y Taranc\u00f3n. Without the conjunction, the footballer Rafael Mart\u00edn V\u00e1zquez, when referred to by his surnames Mart\u00edn V\u00e1zquez mistakenly appears to be forenamed Mart\u00edn rather than Rafael, whilst, to his annoyance, the linguist Fernando L\u00e1zaro Carreter occasionally was addressed as Don L\u00e1zaro, rather than as Don Fernando (L\u00e1zaro can be either forename or surname). Moreover, when the maternal surname begins with an i vowel sound, written with either the vowel I (Ibarra), the vowel Y (Ybarra archaic spelling) or the combination Hi + consonant (Higueras), Spanish euphony substitutes e in place of y, thus the example of the Spanish statesman Eduardo Dato e Iradier (1856\u20131921)."

        "content": "The Basque-speaking territories (the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre) follow Spanish naming customs (given names + two family names, the two family names being usually the father's and the mother's). The given names are officially in one language (Basque or Spanish) but often people use a translated or shortened version. A bilingual Basque-Spanish speaker will not necessarily bear a Basque name, and a monolingual Spanish speaker can use a Basque name or a Basque hypocoristic of an official Spanish name; e.g. a Francisco (official Spanish name) may be known as Patxi (Basque hypocoristic). Some Basque-language names and surnames are foreign transliterations into the Basque tongue, e.g. Ander (English: \"Andrew\"; Spanish: Andr\u00e9s), Mikel (English: \"Michael\"; Spanish: Miguel), or Ane (English: \"Anne\"; Spanish: Ana). In some cases, the name's original-language denotation is translated to Basque, e.g., Zutoia and Zedarri denote the Spanish Pilar (English: \"Pillar\"). Moreover, some originally Basque names, such as Xabier and Eneko (English \"Xavier\" and \"Inigo\") have been transliterated into Spanish (Javier and \u00cd\u00f1igo). Recently, Basque names without a direct equivalent in other languages have become popular, e.g. Aitor (a legendary patriarch), Hodei (\"cloud\"), Iker (\"to investigate\"), and Amaia (\"the end\"). Some Basque names without a direct Spanish meaning, are unique to the Basque language, for instance, Eneko, Garikoitz, Urtzi. Basque names, rather than Spanish names, are preponderant in the Basque Country, countering the Spanish-name imposition of the Franco r\u00e9gime requiring people being given only Spanish names at birth. After Franco's death and the restoration of democracy in Spain, many Basque adults changed their Spanish names to the Basque equivalent, e.g. from Miguel to Mikel. A source for modern Basque names is Sabino Arana's Deun-Ixendegi Euzkotarra (\"Basque saint-name collection\", published in 1910). Instead of the traditional Basque adaptations of Romance names, he proposed others he made up and that in his opinion were truer to the originals and adapted better to the Basque phonology. For example, his brother Luis became Koldobika, from Frankish Hlodwig. The traditionals Peru (from Spanish \"Pedro\"), Pello or Piarres (from French \"Pierre\"), all meaning \"Peter\", became Kepa from Aramaic \u05db\u05d9\u05e4\u05d0 (Kepha). He believed that the suffix -[n]e was inherently feminine, and new names like Nekane (\"pain\"+ne, \"Dolores\") or Garbi\u00f1e (\"clean\"+ne, \"Immaculate [Conception]\") are frequent among Basque females. Basque surnames usually denote the patronymic house of the bearer; e.g. Etxebarria \u2013 \"the new house\", from etxe (house) + barri (new) + a (the), denotes \"related to a so-named farmhouse\"; in the same way, Garaikoetxea \u2013 \"the house in the heights\", garai (\"height\") + etxe (\"house\") + a (the). Sometimes, surnames denote not the house itself but a characteristic of the place, e.g. Saratxaga \u2013 \"willow-place\", from saratze (\"willow\") + -aga (\"place of\"); Loyola, from loi (\"mud\") + ola (\"iron smithery\"); Arriortua \u2013 \"stone orchard\", from harri (\"stone\") + ortua (\"orchard\"). Before the 20th century all Basque men were considered nobles (indeed, some Basque surnames, e.g. Irujo or Medoza, were related to some of the oldest Spanish noble families), and many of them used their status to emigrate with privileges to other regions of the Spanish Empire, especially the Americas, due to which some Basque surnames became common to the Spanish-American world; e.g. Mendoza \u2013 \"cold mountain\", from mendi (\"mountain\" + hotza (\"cold\"); Salazar \u2013 \"old hall\", from sala (\"hall\") + zahar (\"old\"). Until 1978, Spanish was the single official language of the Spanish civil registries and Basque surnames had to be registered according to the Spanish phonetical rules (for example, the Spanish \"ch\" sound merges the Basque \"ts\", \"tx\", and \"tz\", and someone whose surname in Standard Basque would be \"Krutxaga\" would have to write it as \"Cruchaga\", letter \"k\" also not being used in Spanish). Although the democratic restoration ended this policy, allowing surnames to be officially changed into their Basque phonology, there still are many people who hold Spanish-written Basque surnames, even in the same family: a father born before 1978 would be surnamed \"Echepare\" and his children, \"Etxepare\". This policy even changed the usual pronunciation of some Basque surnames. For instance, in Basque, the letter \"z\" maintained a sibilant \"s\"-like sound, while Spanish changed it; thus, a surname such as \"Zabala\" should be properly read similar to \"sabala\" (), although in Spanish, because the \"z\" denotes a \"th\" sound (), it would be read as \"Tha-bala\" (). However, since the letter \"z\" exists in Spanish, the registries did not force the Zabalas to transliterate their surname. In the Basque provinces of Biscay and Gipuzkoa, it was uncommon to take a surname from the place (town or village) where one resided, unless one was a foundling; in general, people bearing surnames such as Bilbao (after the Basque city of Bilbao) are descendants of foundlings. However, in the Basque province of Alava and, to a lesser extent, in Navarre, it was common to add one's birth village to the surname using the Spanish particle de to denote a toponymic, particularly when the surname was a common one; for instance, someone whose surname was Lopez and whose family was originally from the valley of Ayala could employ Lopez de Ayala as a surname. This latter practice is also common in Castile. Basque compound surnames are relatively common, and were created with two discrete surnames, e.g. Elorduizapaterietxe \u2013 Elordui + Zapaterietxe, a practice denoting family allegiances or the equal importance of both families. This custom sometimes conduced to incredibly long surnames, for compound surnames could be used to create others; for example, the longest surname recorded in Spain is Basque, Burionagonatotoricagageazcoechea, formed by Buriona+ Gonatar + Totorika + Beazcoetxea. Finally, the nationalist leader Sabino Arana pioneered a naming custom of transposing the name-surname order to what he thought was the proper Basque language syntax order; e.g. the woman named Miren Zabala would be referred to as Zabala'ta\u0155 Miren \u2013 the surname first, plus the -tar suffix denoting \"from a place\", and then the name. Thus, Zabala'ta\u0155 Miren means \"Miren, of the Zabala family\". The change in the order is effected because in the Basque tongue, declined words (such as Zabala'ta\u0155) that apply to a noun are uttered before the noun itself; another example of this would be his pen name, Arana ta Goiri'ta\u0155 Sabin. This Basque naming custom was used in nationalist literature, not in formal, official documents wherein the Castilian naming convention is observed."

Just like elsewhere, many surnames were also generated from jobs or professions (Carpinteiro 'carpenter', Cabaleiro 'Knight', Ferreiro 'Smith', Besteiro 'Crossbowman'), physical characteristics (Gago 'Twangy', Tato 'Stutterer', Couceiro 'Tall and thin', Bugallo 'fat', Pardo 'Swarthy'), or origin of the person (Franco and Franc\u00e9s 'French', Portugu\u00e9s 'Portuguese'). Although many Galician surnames have been historically adapted into Spanish phonetics and orthography, they are still clearly recognizable as Galician words: Freijedo, Spanish adaptation of freixedo 'place with ash-trees'; Seijo from seixo 'stone'; Doval from do Val 'of the Valley'; Rejenjo from Reguengo, Galician evolution of local Latin-Germanic word Regalingo 'Royal property'. Specially relevant are the Galician surnames originated from medieval patronymics, present in local documentation since the 9th century, and popularized from the 12th century on.

Froiz (medieval form Froaz, from the Germanic name Froila 'Lord' + suffix -ici-): Spanish 'Flores'. Garc\u00eda (medieval form Gar\u00e7ia, from the name Garcia). Giance (from the name Xian, old orthography Jiam, derived of Latin Iulianus + suffix -ici-), with no Spanish equivalent. G\u00f3mez (medieval form Gomes, from the name Gomes).

Some of them (namely P\u00e1ez, M\u00e9ndez, V\u00e1zquez) are characteristically Galician due to the drop of intervocalic -l-, -d-, -g- and -n-, but the most present surnames in Galicia could also be of Spanish origin (although Lugo is the only province in Spain with a majority of people surnamed L\u00f3pez)."

When asked in 2009 if he invented the blast beat, Benante replied, \"If you mean that I decided to sit in my room and invent it, no it wasn't like that. The thing was something that had been around the NY hardcore scene for ages but hadn't been used for other things. The first time it really happened was on S.O.D's 'Milk' song, so I guess you could say I had a lot to do with it. Now a lot of bands are using it, and doing it really well.\" The album had some controversy due to the lyrics, which addressed homosexuality, women and foreign cultures. Dan Lilker stated, \"The lyrics were never intended to be serious, just to piss people off.\" While the album raised no eyebrows at the time for its tongue-in-cheek yet topical content , later generations began to further scrutinize the lyrics. In an interview with Songfacts in 2014, when asked \"If Speak English or Die came out today, do you think that because of the political correctness of today, it would go over the same?\", Lilker responded, \"It probably would have had a harder time just because people seem to be more uptight now.

Scott Ian once recalled that Eddie Vedder was a fan of the album as well, saying he \"cornered me one night at a party for 25 minutes telling me this story about the first time he heard Speak English Or Die and how it affected his life.\" There were also plans for a Speak English or Die tribute album featuring multiple artists during the late '90s, but the release never materialized."

Consequently, Shakira took a two-year hiatus, allowing her to complete her high school education. Looking to revive her struggling career, Shakira decided to make an international debut studio album.

        "content": "Predating Nintendo Power was the Nintendo Fun Club News, a newsletter sent to club members for free. In mid-1988 it was discontinued after seven issues in favor of Nintendo Power. The new magazine was founded by Nintendo of America marketing manager Gail Tilden in 1988. The first issue, dated July/August 1988, spotlights the NES game Super Mario Bros. 2. Of this issue, 3.6 million copies were published, with every member of the Nintendo Fun Club receiving a free copy. From the beginning, Nintendo Power focuses heavily on providing game strategy, reviews, and previews of upcoming games. In mid-1998, Nintendo Power first allowed outside advertising in the magazine, formerly reserved for Nintendo-based products only. In its early years, ads only appeared in the first and last few pages of the magazine, leaving no ads to break up the magazine's editorial content. In July 2005, Nintendo Power introduced a new design to appeal to a limited gaming audience, including a new logo and article format. Along with the cosmetic overhaul came a greater focus on Nintendo fans, staff reviews, rumor-milling, and fan service including an expanded and enhanced reader mail segment (known as \"Pulse\") and a revamped \"Community\" section. Nintendo introduced a new incentive promotional offer that involved the registration of three Nintendo (or Nintendo affiliated) products through Nintendo.com to receive a free three issue trial subscription to Nintendo Power. Later, the magazine changed its focus from game strategies and cheat codes to mainly news, previews, and articles on upcoming games. On September 19, 2007, Nintendo officially announced that the large magazine publisher Future US would begin publishing Nintendo Power. The company's first official issue was released in October, as issue #222 (December 2007). It was also revealed that circulation would be increased to 13 issues a year, with the extra magazine being a holiday season bonus issue. Nintendo Power stopped making the Bonus issue in 2011. On August 21, 2012, Nintendo announced that it had opted not to renew the licensing agreement with Future Publishing and that Nintendo Power would cease publication after 24 years. The final issue would be December 2012.  Senior Editor, Chris Hoffman stated that his staff would \"try to make the last issues memorable\". Nintendo reportedly did not actively participate in discussions to continue the magazine online. Nintendo Power officially returned on December 20, 2017, as a podcast, using the original logo design."

        "content": "The magazine was edited at first by Fun Club \"President\" Howard Phillips, himself an avid gamer. While the Fun Club News focused solely on games made in-house by Nintendo, Nintendo Power was created to allow for reviews of games produced by those licensed by Nintendo, such as Konami, Capcom, and the like. Nintendo Powers mascot in the late 1980s and early 1990s was Nester, a comic character created by Phillips. After Phillips left the company, Nester became the magazine's sole mascot. Early issues of the magazine featured a two-page Howard and Nester comic, which was later replaced with the two-page Nester's Adventures, later reduced to one page, and eventually dropped altogether. Subsequently, Mario replaced Nester as the mascot of the magazine. Later, during the early 2000s, the magazine made another mascot out of its Senior Writer, Alan Averill. Apparently very camera-shy, Averill himself never appeared in any photos; rather, he was represented by a plush toy of a Blue Slime from Dragon Quest. Fans often clamored to see what Averill actually looked like, but the magazine continued to substitute with photos of the toy, and even claimed that Alan was, in fact, a Blue Slime. Eventually, Averill retired from Nintendo Power, joining Nintendo of America's localization department. To this day, most fans have never seen a real image of Averill. The inclusion of a photo of Mr. T in the Player's Pulse section became a running gag in the early half of 2005. Late in the magazine's life, running gags centered on Chuck Norris references and jokes at the expense of writer Chris Shepperd. During the early 1990s, the magazine used what was a unique and very expensive promotion: giving away a free copy of the new NES game Dragon Quest to every new subscriber. This promotion was in part a move on Nintendo's part to make money off Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest in Japan) which had not sold nearly as well as Nintendo had anticipated, and it was left with a large number of unsold cartridges on its hands. The promotion both helped the company get rid of the unsold merchandise, and won the magazine thousands of new subscribers. Following the release of the Super NES, the magazine featured lengthy, continuous comic stories based on Super Mario World and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. After these stories ended, they were replaced by similar multi-issue stories based on Star Fox, Super Metroid, and later on, Nintendo 64 games such as Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire and Blast Corps. Comics based on the animated series of Pok\u00e9mon and Kirby: Right Back At Ya! also made several appearances. Toward the end, short excerpts based on Custom Robo and Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes are featured, as well as a very short Metroid Prime comic, and one based on the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon games translated from the original Japanese version."

Nester was created by Howard Phillips, \"President\" of the Nintendo Fun Club and a former editor of Nintendo Power, to be the supporting character in his comic strip, Howard & Nester. The comic strips generally advertised new games, often by dream sequences where Nester was actually a given video game character. From 1989 to 1993, The Nintendo Power Awards featured Nester-shaped trophies and were referred to in the magazine as the \"Nesters\" as a reference to the Oscars. In the June 1991 issue (Volume 25), Phillips was written out of the strip after his real-life counterpart left Nintendo to work for LucasArts. The strip was retitled Nester's Adventures the following issue and continued publication until Volume 55 (December 1993). Nester, now as a college student, appeared in Nintendo Power issue #100. He is seen again in issue #231, the magazine's twentieth anniversary, here a grown man with a son new to Nintendo. Nester's final appearance in Nintendo Power is in the final issue, Volume 285, in a comic titled \"Nester & Max\", where he is seen reading and lamenting the final issue. Nester is featured in a few video games that were released while the character was in the magazine. His first appearance was as a commentator in NES Play Action Football. Other appearances include the ending of To the Earth. Nester is the main character in Nester's Funky Bowling for the Virtual Boy, which also introduces his sister Hester. The character of Lark in Pilotwings 64 for the Nintendo 64 was based on Nester. Several NES games feature the name \"NESTER\" as one of the pre-set names on high-score lists, or a default character name such as in To the Earth.  The original NES release of Dragon Warrior references both Howard and Nester through character dialog, however this was removed in the later Game Boy Color version.  He is mentioned in one line of dialogue in the game StarTropics. A DLC microgame in WarioWare D.I.Y. created by Nintendo Power called Funky Boxing (a loose reference to Nester's Funky Bowling) does not have any apparent references to the character, but if the game is opened in the editor, the player's boxer is named \"NESTER\"."

The title is a reference to a nameless black Labrador Retriever that wandered around the Headley Grange studios during the recording of the album. The song was recorded with recording engineer Andy Johns at Island Studios on Basing Street in London. Bassist John Paul Jones, who is credited with writing the main riff, was inspired by Muddy Waters' controversial 1968 album Electric Mud.  He added a winding riff and complex rhythm changes, that biographer Keith Shadwick describes as a \"clever pattern that turns back on itself more than once, crossing between time signatures as it does.\" The group had a difficult time with the turnaround, but drummer John Bonham's solution was to play it straight through as if there was no turnaround.  In live performances, Bonham eliminated the  variation so that Robert Plant could perform his a cappella vocal interludes and then have the instruments return at the proper time. For his guitar parts, Jimmy Page used a Gibson Les Paul to record multiple overdubs."

Early Indian alchemical texts discuss the use of prepared forms of mercury or cinnabar (see samskaras). However, there is also ample mention of the preparation of medical tinctures in the early science of Indian alchemy. Significant progress in alchemy was made in ancient India. An 11th-century Persian chemist and physician named Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n B\u012br\u016bn\u012b reported \"[the Indians] have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them.  They call it Ras\u00e2yana, a word composed with rasa, i.e., gold.  It means an art which is restricted to certain operations, drugs, and compound medicines, most of which are taken from plants. Its principles restore the health of those who were ill beyond hope, and give back youth to fading old age...\" Rase\u015bvara, a school of Indian philosophy, was focused on finding Moksha (perfection, immortality, liberation) using mercury. As such, it focused its efforts on transmutation of the human body: from mortal to immortal. The texts of Ayurvedic Medicine and Science have aspects similar to alchemy: concepts of cures for all known diseases, and treatments that focus on anointing the body with oils. Since alchemy eventually became ingrained in the vast field of Indian erudition, influences from other metaphysical and philosophical doctrines such as Samkhya, Yoga, Vaisheshika and Ayurveda were inevitable. Nonetheless, most of the Rasay\u0101na texts track their origins back to Kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of Matsyendranatha and the lineage of the Natha Siddhas. Two famous examples were Nagarjunacharya and Nityanadhiya. Nagarjunacharya was a Buddhist monk who, in ancient times, ran the great university of Nagarjuna Sagara. His book, Rasaratanakaram is a famous example of early Indian medicine. In traditional Indian medicinal terminology, \"rusa\" translates as \"mercury\" and Nagarjunacharya was said to have developed a method to convert the mercury into gold."

These plants were found to offer protection against these stressors, as judged by using markers of stress responses and objective parameters for stress manifestations. Using a model of cisplatin induced alterations in gastrointestinal motility, the ability of these plants to exert a normalizing effect, irrespective of direction of pathological change was tested.... All the plant drugs were found to be safe in both acute and subacute toxicity studies. Studies on the mechanisms of action of the plants revealed that they all produced immunostimulation. The protection offered by Tinospora cordifolia against stress induced gastric mucosal damage was lost if macrophage activity was blocked. Emblica officinalis strengthened the defence mechanisms against free radical damage induced during stress. The effect of Emblica officinalis appeared to depend on the ability of target tissues to synthesize prostaglandins. Recent data obtained with Tinospora cordifolia have led researchers to suggest that it may induce genotypic adaptation, further opening the arena for more research and experimentation."

These classical Rasayan formulas, contain a large number of ingredients, including minerals, pearl, coral and gems, and include a specially processed (samskara) mercury (the word ras indicates mercury as an ingredient). Because of negative publicity and cost factor, the use of the classical rasayana formulas has declined considerably, and most of the preparations available now have herbal ingredients with a couple of mineral and animal products. The non-availability and wild life protection act has made the use of musk, amber, and parts of wild-life animals nearly impossible. The current Rasayan formulas are based on such ingredients as amla (Emblica officinalis) which, if fresh, has high content of vitamin C, Terminalia belerica, Terminalia chebula, Shilajit, Long pepper, Black pepper, Ginger, processed Guggul, Guduchi, Ashwaganda, Shatavari and similar ingredients. Rasayan Shastr in Ancient India was much less developed than today. Nevertheless, the use and practice of Rasayan was widespread in Ancient India, and some examples of applied rasayan include paints used in the caves of Ajanta and Ellora, Maharashtra state, the steel of Vishnustambha (literal meaning: the tower of Vishnu), and a processed wood sample in the Kondivade caves near the Rajmachi fort in Maharashtra."

Following the success of their previous album, Some Girls, which had been their biggest hit to date, the Rolling Stones returned to the studio in early 1979 to start writing and recording its follow-up.  Full-time members Mick Jagger (vocals), Keith Richards (guitar), Ronnie Wood (guitar), Bill Wyman (bass), and Charlie Watts (drums) were joined by frequent collaborators Ian Stewart (keyboards), Nicky Hopkins (keyboards), Bobby Keys (saxophone) and Sugar Blue (harmonica). Upon release, it topped the charts in at least six countries, including the US, UK, and Canada.  Hit singles from the album include the title track, which reached No. 1 in Canada, No. 3 in the US, and No. 9 in the UK and \"She's So Cold\", which was a top-40 single in several countries.  The recording sessions for Emotional Rescue were so productive that several tracks left off the album would form the core of the follow-up, 1981's Tattoo You."

Fresh from the revitalisation of Some Girls (1978), Richards and Mick Jagger led the Stones through dozens of new songs, some of which were held over for Tattoo You (1981), picking only ten for Emotional Rescue. Several of the tracks on the album featured just the core Rolling Stones band members: Jagger, Richards, Ronnie Wood, Charlie Watts, and Bill Wyman. On others, they were joined by keyboardists Nicky Hopkins and co-founder Ian Stewart, sax player Bobby Keys and harmonica player Sugar Blue. Songs left off the album would find their way onto the next album, Tattoo You (\"Hang Fire\", \"Little T&A\", and \"No Use in Crying\"). \"Think I'm Going Mad\", another song from the sessions, was released as the B-side to \"She Was Hot\" in 1984. A cover song sung by Richards: \"We Had It All\", was released on the 2011 deluxe Some Girls package."

The album gave the Rolling Stones their first UK No. 1 album since 1973's Goats Head Soup and spent seven weeks atop the US charts. The follow-up single \"She's So Cold\" was a top 30 hit while \"Dance Pt. 1\" reached No. 9 on Billboards Dance chart. Critical reception was relatively muted, with most reviewers considering the album somewhat formulaic and unambitious, particularly in contrast to its predecessor. Writing in Rolling Stone, Ariel Swartley stated that \"as far as the music goes, 'familiar' is an understatement. There's hardly a melody here that you haven't heard from the Stones before\". Robert Christgau was more positive, claiming that \"no one will ever mistake this for a great Stones album, but I bet it sounds more interesting than It's Only Rock 'n Roll\". Retrospective assessments have been somewhat kinder, with several critics praising the band's performance, despite the sometimes lightweight material. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic states that the album \"may consist mainly of filler, but it's expertly written and performed filler\". In 1994, Emotional Rescue was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, and again in 2009 by Universal Music. In 2011, it was released by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD version. The 1994 remaster was initially released in a Collector's Edition CD, which replicated many elements of the original album packaging, including the colour poster."

His earliest influences included the sound of early British bands, such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, influenced by popular American rhythm and blues. At the same time, folk influences from artists such as Bob Dylan and Simon & Garfunkel left a strong mark on him, along with some of the musicals being performed so close to his childhood home in Soho that he could often hear them drifting through his room. Stevens's older brother, David Gordon, attracted the attention of music producer Mike Hurst, formerly of the Springfields, in the hope of finding a producer interested in his younger brother's music. After a demo was recorded, a deal was struck between the two. The album was not released until 1967; however, recording began on 10 July 1966, with a few advance singles appearing around that time."

Session bassist John Paul Jones played on the first singles two years before becoming a member of Led Zeppelin. The lyrics for the B-side of the first single, \"Portobello Road\", were written by Kim Fowley, who encouraged Stevens to compose a melody for the song. The single initially reached No. 28 on the UK charts, followed by \"Matthew and Son\", the next single and title track, which went to No. 2 on the UK charts, making Stevens into a popular and clean-cut teenage crooner."

Music critic Robert Christgau of The Village Voice later called Matthew and Son \"a rarity: a forgotten record that shouldn't be\", and said that both its title track and \"I Love My Dog\" were \"two rock songs we should have heard more of in 1967\". AllMusic's Bruce Eder gave it three-and-a-half out of five stars and said that \"it's very distant from the sound that Stevens was ultimately known for, and in many ways, it's more dated than what he did for Island/A&M, but it's much more self-consciously accessible, arranged in different styles\"."

It is about a Flemish boy named Nello and his dog, Patrasche, and is set in Antwerp. In Japan, Korea and the Philippines, the novel has been an extremely popular children's classic for decades and has been adapted into several Japanese films and anime. Since the 1980s, the Belgian board of tourism caught on to the phenomenon and built two monuments honoring the story to please East-Asian tourists. There is a small statue of Nello and Patrasche at the Kapelstraat in the Antwerp suburb of Hoboken, and a commemorative plaque in front of the Antwerp Cathedral donated by Toyota, that was later replaced by a marble statue of the two characters covered by a cobblestone blanket, created by the artist Batist Vermeulen."

His impoverished grandfather, Jehan Daas, who lives in a small village near the city of Antwerp, takes him in. One day, Nello and Jehan find a dog that was almost beaten to death, and name him \u201cPatrasche\u201d. Due to the good care and kindness shown to him by Jehan, the dog recovers its health, and from then on, Nello and Patrasche are inseparable. Nello is forced to work as a milk seller, because Jehan's unnamed, crooked landlord demands that he pay more rent money or face eviction. Patrasche helps Nello pull his small milk cart into town each morning. Nello falls in love with Aloise, the daughter of Baas Cogez, a well-off man in the village, but Baas objects, as he doesn't want his daughter to have a poor sweetheart. Although Nello is illiterate, he is very talented in drawing. He enters a junior drawing contest in Antwerp, hoping to win the first prize of 200 francs per year; however, the jury selects a different winner. Sometime later, a fire breaks out on Baas\u2019s property. The landlord lies and says Nello was responsible for the fire to escape responsibly for neglecting the property; Baas then tells Nello that he is never to see Aloise again. Later, Jehan dies, and the landlord promptly evicts Nello and Patrasche. With no home, they are forced to wander the streets. Distraught and miserable, Nello decides that he wants to go to the cathedral of Antwerp, to see Rubens' The Elevation of the Cross and The Descent from the Cross \u2014 but the exhibition in the cathedral is only for paying customers, and he has no money left. On the night of Christmas Eve, Nello and Patrasche find that the door to the church has been left unlocked. They go inside, and the next morning are found dead of hypothermia in front of the triptych."

It inspired film and anime adaptations, including the 1975 animated TV series Dog of Flanders which reached an audience of 30 million viewers on its first broadcast. In Belgium, the story is more obscure. Only in 1987 did it receive a Dutch translation; this happened after the tale was adapted into a story of the popular comic book series Suske en Wiske. Since then, monuments were raised to commemorate Nello and Patrasche to please tourists. In 2007, Didier Volckaert and An van Dienderen directed a documentary about the international popularity of the story: \"Patrasche, A Dog of Flanders - Made in Japan\".

Published only six times from 1947 to 1949, it struggled in its early years. By 1952, regular contributor and editor John R. Bond and his wife Elaine had become the owners of the magazine, which then grew until its sale to CBS Publications in 1972. The ampersand (&) in the title was introduced in 1955 by then Editor Terry Galanoy, who replaced the word \"and\" in the magazine's name because the words Road and Track were graphically too long for newsstand-effective recognition. In 1988, Hachette Filipacchi Media took ownership of the magazine. In October 2008, Matt DeLorenzo became editor-in-chief, succeeding Thos L. Bryant, who had been in place for 20 years. Hearst Magazines purchased the magazine in 2011. In June 2012, Larry Webster assumed the role of editor-in-chief, and DeLorenzo became an adviser to the publication. Additionally, the magazine moved its operations from Newport Beach, California, to Ann Arbor, Michigan. In February 2016, Webster resigned as editor-in-chief and Kim Wolfkill was announced as his replacement. In the March/April 2019 issue, Wolfkill announced that the editorial offices in Michigan were closing, and that publication was moving to New York, New York, at the Hearst Tower. His LinkedIn profile lists February 2019 as his final date at Road & Track. Travis Okulski, Road & Track's website director at the time, took on the editor-in-chief role from the May 2019 issue onwards. Car and Driver and Road & Track are sister publications at Hearst and share the same advertising, sales, marketing, and circulation departments. However, their editorial operations are distinct and they have separate publishers. In August 2020, the magazine transitioned to bi-monthly publishing and dropped the use of the full \u201cRoad & Track\u201d title. In addition to the title change, the magazine design was relaunched in a minimalist style, and offered new subscription packages ranging from $75 per year to almost $1000. Prior to the relaunch, several key contributors left or were let go."

The band, initially called Roundabout, was the idea of former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis, who recruited Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore before leaving the project. The Mk. I line-up of the band was completed by vocalist/frontman Rod Evans, along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Ian Paice, in March 1968. After about two months of rehearsals, Shades of Deep Purple was recorded in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers, thoroughly rearranged to include classical interludes and sound more psychedelic. Stylistically, the music is close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever-growing audience in the late 1960s. The album was not well received in the UK, where it sold very few copies and did not chart. In the US, on the other hand, it was a success and the single \"Hush\", an energetic rock track written by Joe South and originally recorded by Billy Joe Royal, became very popular at the time, reaching number 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The good sales of the album and the intense radio play of the single contributed largely to the attention Deep Purple would get in their early US tours and also during the 1970s. Modern reviews of the album are generally positive and consider Shades of Deep Purple an important piece in the history of Deep Purple."

        "content": "When Deep Purple's first line-up came together in 1967, there was a moment of transition for the British music scene. Beat was still popular, especially in dance halls and outside the capital, but the tastes of young people buying records and filling up the clubs was rapidly changing in favour of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock. New bands like The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, and The Nice were pioneers in combining classical music with rock, using complex and daring arrangements. At the same time, psychedelia was making strides in the hedonistic swinging London society, where bands like Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic and Cream experimented with different forms of drug-induced rock music, in line with the hippie subculture coming from the USA. Many well-known acts, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who, were influenced by the changing feel and added many elements of progressive and psychedelic rock to their albums of that period. During this time of great creativity for the British musical scene in the summer of 1967, Chris Curtis, former drummer of the beat band The Searchers, contacted London businessman Tony Edwards to find financing for a new group he was putting together, to be called Roundabout. The name meant that the group would contain a revolving cast of non-permanent members getting on and off the stage like a musical roundabout, with only Curtis as mainstay and singer. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance and manage the venture with two business partners, Ron Hire and John Coletta, and the three of them founded Hire-Edwards-Coletta (HEC) Enterprises. In September 1967, the first successful Roundabout recruitment was Curtis' flatmate, the classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord; he had most notably played with The Artwoods, a band led by Art Wood, brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and featuring Keef Hartley. At that time, Lord was playing in a band backing the successful pop vocalists The Flower Pot Men called The Garden, which also included bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little. Simper and Little were alerted by Lord of the Roundabout project and remained in standby for an eventual involvement. They recommended to Lord the guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whose playing Chris Curtis had appreciated when his band The Searchers had played at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany. Blackmore had been a member of The Outlaws and had played as session and live musician with many beat, pop and rock acts, including Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages, where he had met Little. Curtis contacted Blackmore to audition for the new group and persuaded him to move from Hamburg, where he was hanging out in local clubs. The guitarist came back to England for good to join the group in December 1967. Meanwhile, Curtis' erratic behaviour and his sudden loss of interest in the project he had started slowed down any development, forcing his financiers, HEC Enterprises, to drop him and entrust Lord and Blackmore with the task of filling out the rest of the band. Lord signed up as bassist his friend Simper, whose fame at the time came from his membership in the rock and roll group Johnny Kidd & The Pirates and for having survived the car crash in 1966 that killed Kidd. The line-up of Roundabout was completed by drummer Bobby Woodman, recruited by Blackmore. Dave Curtiss, an acquaintance of Woodman, was at first considered as singer, but he left to fulfill previous commitments. According to Simper, Ian Gillan, the singer of the band Episode Six, was also contacted for an audition, but declined the offer."

        "content": "Roundabout moved into Deeves Hall, a rented old farmhouse near the village of South Mimms, Hertfordshire in late February 1968. There, while waiting for the arrival of new musical instruments and equipment, they continued the search for a singer through an advertisement in the British music paper Melody Maker. Rod Stewart was among the dozens of aspiring vocalists that were considered for the auditions, but was not up to the standards the band required. They chose Rod Evans instead, who was already the singer of the club band The Maze. Evans brought along after the audition his 19-year-old bandmate Ian Paice, a drummer whom Blackmore recognised from his days in Hamburg. They quickly improvised an audition for Paice and he was chosen on the spot to replace Woodman behind the drum kit. Woodman was unhappy with the direction the band was heading and the other members thought that he was not suited for their sound. The first rehearsals of what would be known as the Mk. I line-up of Deep Purple involved mostly jamming and some work on the instrumentals \"And the Address\" and \"Mandrake Root\", which Blackmore and Lord had written earlier that year. Mandrake Root was also the name of an earlier band that Blackmore had been trying to form in Germany, before being contacted by Roundabout's management. After the two instrumentals, the first proper song to be arranged was \"Help!\", a Beatles cover that Chris Curtis wanted to include in an eventual album. Evans wrote some lyrics for \"Mandrake Root\" and reduced to one the number of instrumental tracks. Having arranged and rehearsed the first three songs, the musicians focused their attention on \"I'm So Glad\", a song by Skip James which had earlier been covered by Cream and The Maze. The next addition during rehearsals was \"Hey Joe\", a song originally, but disputably, written by Billy Roberts and mistakenly credited to Deep Purple on original releases of the album. The main inspiration for the new arrangement of the song was the 1966 hit version by American guitarist Jimi Hendrix, but the track length was stretched with the inclusion of classical-influenced instrumental sections. The band also selected a pop rock song called \"Hush\", written by Joe South for Billy Joe Royal the previous year, which Blackmore had heard while in Germany."

        "content": "With a possible set list shaping up during rehearsals, Blackmore convinced a friend of his, Derek Lawrence, to be the band's producer. They had met years before, when both worked for producer Joe Meek and Lawrence ran an independent production company that recorded singles for release in the United States. Lawrence had many contacts in the US and was present at some of Roundabout's sessions, remaining impressed. Through Lawrence, HEC Enterprises contacted the new American record label Tetragrammaton Records, which was looking for a British band to work with. HEC arranged for the band to cut some demos for the American label in late March and early April at Trident Studios in London. They taped two of their previously developed songs, \"Hush\" and \"Help!\", as well as two new songs: \"Love Help Me\" had already been developed before Evans and Paice joined, while \"Shadows\" was quickly written and arranged by the band for those recording sessions. Lawrence also played the demo of \"Help!\" to the British recording company EMI, which offered a deal for distribution in Europe with its sub-label Parlophone. All the demos, with the exception of \"Shadows\", were sent to Tetragrammaton for approval. The recording of the demos was followed by a short promotional tour of eight dates in Denmark and Sweden through April and May, booked as Roundabout by a friend of Lord. The band name was changed at this time, after Blackmore suggested the title of his grandmother's favourite song, \"Deep Purple\" by Peter DeRose. Deep Purple played their first gig at the venue of Vestpoppen - a club set up on Parkskolen - a school and youthclub on 76 Parkvej in Taastrup, Denmark on 20 April 1968 and the live set comprised all the new songs and the cover of \"Little Girl\", originally by John Mayall and Eric Clapton. When they returned to England, Tetragrammaton confirmed the decision to sign the band. This was a saving grace, because HEC had spent nearly all their budget for promotion and equipment. The band relocated to Highleigh Manor, in Balcombe, West Sussex, because Deeves Hall was no longer available. While the band was on tour, some studio time had been booked and on Saturday, 11 May 1968, Deep Purple went into Pye Studios at ATV House in London. There, with Lawrence producing and Barry Ainsworth acting as engineer, they recorded the recently gigged material using a four-track tape machine. It was custom in those years, especially for debut bands, to have small production budgets, which allowed very limited time in the recording studio. Under these conditions it was difficult to do many overdubs and the songs were recorded live in one or two takes. \"And the Address\" and \"Hey Joe\" were cut first, followed by \"Hush\" and \"Help!\" later the first day. On Sunday, \"Love Help Me\", \"I'm So Glad\" (with a classical music prelude entitled \"Happiness\") and \"Mandrake Root\" were recorded. Finally, on Monday, 13 May, \"One More Rainy Day\" was cut, completing the recording of the album. Sound effects extracted from a BBC album were added as transitions between songs during mixing, which was completed later the same day."

        "content": "The finished album was taken to Tetragrammaton's representatives in London, who approved its release. After the final approval, the band members were dressed in fashionable costumes at the Mr. Fish Emporium, where they did a photo-shoot. The resulting shots were shipped with the master tapes to America where Tetragrammaton began production and distribution of the album. The cover design by Les Weisbrich allegedly cost half a million dollars. The single \"Hush\" was released overseas in June 1968 and it turned out to be a huge success, garnering the band considerable attention and peaking at No. 4 on the US charts and at No. 2 on the Canadian charts. The label's reluctance to release \"Help!\" as the promotional single and instead go for \"Hush\", proved ingenious. Widely distributed and hyped, the song was played on radios all over the US, particularly the West Coast, and the band's fame grew considerably. The album was released in the United States in July 1968 and reached No. 24 on the Billboard Pop Chart. \"Hush\" was released in the UK in late July, but it did not attract much interest. In August, an appearance on British TV at the David Frost Show to lip-sync the song was shot with the roadie Mick Angus standing in for an unavailable Blackmore. However, their presence on TV did not help the sales of the single in the UK and made Parlophone postpone the release of the album. The band recorded some radio sessions for the John Peel's Top Gear radio show on BBC, but otherwise, England in general was not their priority. Those recordings recently resurfaced and are included in the compilation album BBC Sessions 1968\u20131970. Shades of Deep Purple was finally released in the United Kingdom with much simpler cover art in September 1968 and went almost unnoticed there. Jon Lord, in an interview with the magazine Beat Instrumental, reflected on the scarce receptivity of England to his group and on how lucky the band was to be signed to an American label that gave Deep Purple \"far greater freedom both financially and artistically\" than they \"could ever have got with a British company\", which \"as a rule won't spend any time or effort with you until you're an established name\". A monaural pressing of the album was released in the UK and Europe, which was simply a fold-down of the stereo mix. Shades of Deep Purple was reissued many times all over the world, often in a set with the two following albums recorded by the Mk. I line-up. Besides the original issues, the most significant version of the album is the Remastered CD edition released in 2000 by EMI, which contains as bonus tracks previously unreleased recordings from the first demos in April 1968 and from TV show appearances. All the songs were digitally remastered and restored by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios in London, cutting off the sound effects used as transitions in the original edition."

        "title": "Shades of Deep Purple_Musical style",
        "content": "Deep Purple's members were experienced musicians with different musical backgrounds: Lord had trained in classical music and had played in jazz and blues rock ensembles, Blackmore and Simper came from session work in pop rock, Paice and Evans from beat bands. However, no one was an accomplished songwriter. The only one with experience in musical composition was Lord, who wrote the arrangements and the bulk of the music for the first album, with some guitar riffs added by Blackmore. The album shows the potential of the band but does not focus on a distinct sound. Clearly identifiable on the album are the musical styles which were developing in the UK in that period and that influenced the young musicians in Deep Purple, a mix of psychedelic rock, progressive rock, pop rock and hard rock, the latter mostly evident in Blackmore's guitar parts. Traces of the heavy sound that would mark the production of Deep Purple's \"Mk. II\" line-up (when Evans and Simper were replaced by Gillan and Roger Glover) can already be heard in the opening instrumental \"And the Address\" and in \"Mandrake Root\". The main riff of the latter is very similar to the one in the song \"Foxy Lady\", a testimony of Blackmore's admiration for Jimi Hendrix. The other original compositions, the ballad \"One More Rainy Day\" and \"Love Help Me\", are pop rock songs that enhance the commercial appeal of the album, but are considered by critics less interesting than the cover songs. The use of so many cover songs to fill up the album was a common feature at the time, because of the short time given to bands for songwriting and for the rushed schedules of production. The songs covered in the album were all treated with new arrangements to be considerably longer and sound more grandiose than the originals, in an attempt to emulate the American rock band Vanilla Fudge, which many Deep Purple members admired. \"Hush\" and \"Help!\" are clear examples of the \"Vanilla Fudge style of slowing a song down and bluesing it up\" to get a more psychedelic sound. The sound of the band was also heavily influenced by classical music: \"I'm So Glad\" is introduced by \"Prelude: Happiness\", featuring an electric arrangement inspired by the first movement of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's symphonic suite Scheherazade; the cover of \"Hey Joe\" was arranged inserting parts taken from the Miller's Dance, suite no. 2, part 2 of El sombrero de tres picos ballet by Manuel de Falla, on a rhythm reminiscent of the Bol\u00e9ro by Maurice Ravel."

        "content": "Deep Purple's live shows were from the start very loud and hard rocking and their stage set included stacks of custom purple vinyl Marshall amps and fancy dresses. The dualism between Blackmore's flamboyant guitar playing, which he had honed in many years of daily practice and experimented on tour with Sutch, and Lord's rocking Hammond solos was still in an embryonic stage, but it would soon become an integral part of the band's dynamics. Deep Purple debuted at The Roundhouse Theatre in London on 6 July 1968, opening for The Byrds, before The Gun and The Deviants. Their performance was badly received by the audience and by other attending musicians, including Mick Jagger. In spite of this, the band went on playing their live set in local pubs and festivals, but were received coldly and ignored by the press. In an interview with Melody Maker, Ian Paice explained that their lack of touring and promotion in England was due to the low wages they were offered and to the fact that they had very few danceable numbers to attract audience. He stressed that \"we make a point of warning promoters that we are not a dancing group.\" Waiting to start their first US tour and in need of new material to be offered on the American market and to beef up their live show, the band returned to the studio with producer Derek Lawrence to record their second album, The Book of Taliesyn, in August 1968. The new album was recorded before the release of Shades of Deep Purple in the UK. By October, Deep Purple set off to the States to start their US tour. The success of \"Hush\" was a giant boost in America and from their first gigs they received all the attention they had not been given in England. The first dates were at The Inglewood Forum on 18 and 19 October 1968, supporting Cream in their farewell tour. A recording of those live performances was released in 2002 with the title Inglewood \u2013 Live in California. The band played at many different locations, including festivals, bars and even at the Playboy After Dark TV show, alongside Hugh Hefner and a bunch of dancing women. The songs of this album were performed regularly by the Mk. I formation of Deep Purple, but only \"Hush\", \"Help!\" and \"Hey Joe\" found space for a limited time in the live shows of the Mk. II line-up in 1969. However, \"Mandrake Root\", in an expanded and mainly instrumental version, was a staple in Mk. II live shows up until 1972, and the instrumental sections of the song survived even longer, being annexed to live versions of the Machine Head recording \"Space Truckin'\". The opening chords of \"And the Address\" were used into the Mk. II era as an introduction to the song \"Speed King\". \"Hush\" was re-recorded in 1988 and is still an integral part of the live set of the current formation of the band."

        "content": "Reception of the album and the band in their home country was generally negative. Despite being presented as a \"polished commercial group\" in their radio appearances, Deep Purple's stage excesses and success in the US did not make a good impression on British audiences. The Deviants frontman and later journalist Mick Farren described Deep Purple's music as \"a slow and pompous din, somewhere between bad Tchaikovsky and a B-52 taking off on a bombing run\". They were also criticised for being too American and the \"poor man's Vanilla Fudge\". As Brian Connolly of Sweet recalled, \"they were so out of place that you really felt sorry for them.\" By contrast, in the US the band was often introduced as \"the English Vanilla Fudge\" and massive radio coverage of their songs granted success for both the album and tour. Ian Paice said of their success in the US versus their lack of it back home, \"We have been given proper exposure over there. The Americans really know how to push records.\" Decades later, modern critical reviews of the album are generally positive. Bruce Eder of AllMusic considers Shades of Deep Purple, despite some flaws, \"a hell of an album\" and praises the \"infectious\u00a0... spirit of fun\" of the disc, which has \"much more of a '60s feel than we're accustomed to hearing from this band\". Blogcritics contributor David Bowling states that Shades of Deep Purple \"was a creative and very good debut album\", which combines \"psychedelic music with hard rock and early progressive rock into a pleasant but disjointed whole\". PopMatters review of the three albums of the Mk. I line-up considers them \"both respectable and consistent\", although Evans' voice is \"perhaps more suited to heavy pop rather than heavy rock\". Canadian journalist Martin Popoff described this early incarnation of Deep Purple as a \"hard psych band\", more committed to the music than other contemporaries and already capable of creating \"a noise that definitetly foretold of things to come.\" In an Observer Music Monthly Greatest British Albums poll, keyboard player Rick Wakeman chose Shades of Deep Purple as his favourite British record of all time."

The magazine has covered the career of U2 since the late 1970s. Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor first talked to Hot Press about her lesbianism. The magazine has been at the centre of several controversies: for example, Hot Press writer Stuart Clark was interviewing Oasis band member and songwriter Noel Gallagher when Gallagher found out that his brother Liam would not take the stage for that evening's performance, and the band came close to splitting up. Hot Press was at the centre of a legal dispute over the copyright of the term De Dannan in 2009 after it featured an advertisement using the term to promote a new tour by the traditional group. In September 2009, an interview conducted by Olaf Tyaransen with the comedian Tommy Tiernan at Electric Picnic 2009 proved controversial when Tiernan made some remarks which were later perceived as antisemitic. The comments were reported in the Irish and international media; however, both Tyaransen and Hot Press editor Niall Stokes, as well as Tiernan himself, defended them as being taken out of context. In 2020, in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic lock down in Ireland, Hot Press held a set of online music sessions called the Lockdown Sessions featuring artists such as Celaviedmai, Doppler, and Tebi Rex."

        "content": "\"Dominique\" is a 1963 French language popular song, written and performed by the Belgian female singer Jeannine Deckers, better known as S\u0153ur Sourire (\"Sister Smile\" in French) or The Singing Nun. The song is about Saint Dominic, a Spanish-born priest and founder of the Dominican Order, of which she was a member (as Sister Luc-Gabrielle). The English-version lyrics of the song were written by No\u00ebl Regney. In addition to French and English, Deckers recorded versions in Dutch, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese. It was a top selling record in 11 countries in late 1963 and early 1964."

It reached the Top 5 in Norway, Denmark, Ireland and South Africa, with the song making it into the lower reaches of the Top 10 in the Netherlands, West Germany, and the United Kingdom. The song reached and stayed at No. 1 on Top 40 radio station WABC in New York City for the four weeks of 19 November through 10 December.  On WLS Chicago, the song was No. 1 for the three weeks 15\u201329 November 1963.  On both the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and \"Easy Listening chart\", \"Dominique\" was No. 1 for the four weeks 7\u201328 December 1963. The song won the Grammy Award for Best Gospel or Other Religious Recording (Musical) in 1964. It was also a nominee for Grammy Award for Record of the Year, and S\u0153ur Sourire was a nominee for Best Female Vocal Performance. It was the second foreign language song to hit No. 1 on the Hot 100 in 1963, the first being \"Sukiyaki\" by Kyu Sakamoto. For the next ten years or so, although there were a number of hits with most of the vocals in a language other than English (e.g., The Sandpipers' \"Guantanamera\", Ren\u00e9 y Ren\u00e9's \"Lo Mucho Que Te Quiero\", etc.), no other purely foreign language song reached the Billboard Hot 100's top 40 until the Spanish language hit \"Eres t\u00fa (Touch The Wind)\" in 1974. \"Dominique\" outsold Elvis Presley during its stay on the Billboard Hot 100; it was the second to last No. 1 hit before the British Invasion."

The song is heard in the 1985 film Heaven Help Us. In the 1987 Married... with Children episode \"Thinnergy\", \"Dominique\" is one of several songs Peg (Katey Sagal) sings in an attempt to annoy Al (Ed O'Neill). It was used in the 1990 film Mermaids with Cher. It was used in the 1993 film as elevator music For Love or Money with Michael J Fox. The song was referenced in The Simpsons episode \"Bart's Friend Falls in Love\" (1992), where Milhouse van Houten visits his girlfriend in an all-girls convent school. A nun playing guitar and singing \"Dominique\" passes along, followed by several equally happy little girls. The nun's character voice was provided by cast member Maggie Roswell, who knew none of the song's actual French lyrics and instead made up her own. In 1999, it was sung in Everybody Loves Raymond by Robert and Raymond when they learn Debra's sister is becoming a nun. The song also featured in an episode of Welsh sitcom High Hopes In 2009, the song was used in the third series premiere of British teen drama Skins. In 2009, it was also used in Mad Men in the episode \"The Color Blue\", when Don Draper walks into Suzanne Farell's apartment for the second time. In 2012, the song is featured prominently in US anthology series American Horror Story: Asylum, the events of which take place in 1964. The original Belgian French version of the song is playing over and over in the common room of the insane asylum, and the inmates are punished if they disrupt or stop the song from playing. In season 2 of episode 20 (titled 'Rock n Roll Fantasy') of Just the Ten of Us, it is sung by Heather Langenkamp, who played Marie Lubbock. It originally aired 28 April 1989. In the season 3 episode of the science fiction series Dark Matter, entitled \"All the Time in the World\", it is sung by Anthony Lemke and Zoie Palmer. Lemke, who is fully bilingual, plays a character who is caught in a time loop similar to \"Groundhog Day\" and spends his time learning French from the spaceship's android.

        "content": "The Man Who Sold the World is the third studio album by English musician David Bowie. It was originally released by Mercury Records in the United States on 4 November 1970 and in the United Kingdom on 10 April 1971. The album was produced by Tony Visconti and recorded at Trident and Advision Studios in London during April and May 1970. It features the first appearances of guitarist Mick Ronson and drummer Mick Woodmansey on a Bowie record, who would later become famous as members of the Spiders from Mars. Following the largely acoustic and folk rock sound of Bowie's previous 1969 self-titled album, The Man Who Sold the World marked a shift toward hard rock, with elements of blues rock. The lyrics are also darker than his previous releases, exploring themes of insanity, religion, technology and war. None of the songs from the album were released as official singles, although some tracks appeared as B-sides of singles between 1970 and 1973. Originally titled Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis, the title was changed at the last minute by Mercury without Bowie's consultation. The album was released with different cover artwork in the US and the UK. For the US release, the artwork was a cartoon-like drawing of a cowboy in front of an asylum. It was drawn by Michael J. Weller and based on an image of actor John Wayne. Bowie was unenthusiastic about the cover, so he enlisted Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The final image, featuring Bowie wearing a blue dress designed by fashion designer Michael Fish, was used as the cover for the UK release. The Man Who Sold the World was reissued by RCA Records in 1972, featuring a black-and-white picture of Bowie's then-current character Ziggy Stardust on the sleeve, but reissues since 1990 have revived the original UK artwork. The Man Who Sold the World was originally better received by music critics in the US than in the UK. Nevertheless, it was a commercial failure in both countries; however, the 1972 reissue managed to chart in both the US and the UK. Retrospectively, the album has been praised by critics for the band's performance and the unsettling nature of its music and lyrics, being considered by many to be the start of Bowie's \"classic period\". It has since been reissued multiple times and was remixed in 2020, under its original title Metrobolist, for its 50th anniversary."

        "content": "David Bowie's breakthrough single \"Space Oddity\" was released in July 1969, bringing him commercial success and attention. However, its parent album, David Bowie (Space Oddity), released later that year, was not as successful, partly due to the failure of Philips Records to promote the album efficiently. By 1970, the attention Bowie had garnered from \"Space Oddity\" had dissipated and his follow-up single, \"The Prettiest Star\", failed to chart. Realising that his potential as a solo artist was dwindling, Bowie decided to form a band with bassist Tony Visconti, who previously worked with Bowie on Space Oddity, and drummer John Cambridge. Calling themselves Hype, the group still needed a guitarist. On 2 February 1970, Bowie met guitarist Mick Ronson following a performance at the Marquee Club in London. The two connected immediately and agreed to work together. Following their meeting, Ronson joined Hype. For the group's performances, the members wore flamboyant superhero-like costumes, made by Bowie's first wife Angela Burnett, whom he married on 20 March 1970, and Visconti's then-girlfriend Liz Hartley. Bowie was Rainbowman (wearing a rainbow-coloured outfit), Ronson was Gangsterman (wearing a \"sharp double-breasted suit\"), Visconti was Hypeman (sporting a Superman-like outfit with a giant 'H' on the chest), and Cambridge was Cowboyman (wearing a \"frilly\" shirt and overlarge hat). Hype continued performing in the outlandish costumes for many months; after one performance on 11 March 1970, Visconti's clothes were stolen and he had to return home wearing his Hypeman costume. Bowie halted Hype performances at the end of March that year so he could focus on recording and songwriting, as well as resolve managing disputes with his manager Kenneth Pitt. The new single version of the Space Oddity track \"Memory of a Free Festival\" and an early attempt at \"The Supermen\" were recorded during this time. Cambridge was dismissed from Hype at the end of March, with a new drummer, Mick \"Woody\" Woodmansey, joining the group at the suggestion of Ronson. According to biographer Kevin Cann, Cambridge was dismissed by Bowie, but according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, Visconti recalled that the dismissal was Ronson's request. On his first impression of Bowie, Woodmansey said in 2015: \"This guy was living and breathing being a rock & roll star.\" By April 1970, the four members of Hype were living in Haddon Hall, Beckenham, an Edwardian mansion converted to a block of flats that was described by one visitor as having an ambiance \"like Dracula's living room\". Ronson and Visconti built a makeshift studio under the grand staircase at Haddon Hall; Bowie recorded many of his early 1970s demos there."

        "content": "Recording for The Man Who Sold the World began on 17 April 1970 at Advision Studios in London, with the group beginning work on \"All the Madmen\". The next day on 18 April, Ralph Mace was hired to play the Moog synthesiser, borrowed from George Harrison, following his work on the single version of \"Memory of a Free Festival\". At the time, Mace was a 40-year-old concert pianist who was also head of the classical music department at Mercury Records. During this time, Bowie terminated his contract with Pitt and met his future manager Tony Defries, who assisted Bowie in the termination. Recording moved to Trident Studios in London on 21 April 1970 and continued there for the rest of April until mid-May. On 4 May, the band recorded \"Running Gun Blues\" and \"Saviour Machine\", the latter of which was originally the working title for the title track, before Bowie reworked the song into a different melody to form the final version of \"Saviour Machine\". Recording and mixing was moved back to Advision on 12 May and completed ten days later. Bowie recorded his vocal for the title track on the final day. As Bowie was preoccupied with his new wife Angie at the time, as well as his managerial issues, the music was largely arranged by Ronson and Visconti. Ronson used the sessions to learn about many production and arrangement techniques from Visconti. Although Bowie is officially credited as the composer of all music on The Man Who Sold the World, author Peter Doggett quoted Visconti as saying that \"the songs were written by all four of us. We'd jam in a basement, and Bowie would just say whether he liked them or not.\" In Doggett's narrative, \"The band (sometimes with Bowie contributing guitar, sometimes not) would record an instrumental track, which might or might not be based upon an original Bowie idea. Then, at the last possible moment, Bowie would reluctantly uncurl himself from the sofa on which he was lounging with his wife, and dash off a set of lyrics.\" Conversely, Bowie was quoted in a 1998 interview as saying, \"I really did object to the impression that I did not write the songs on The Man Who Sold the World. You only have to check out the chord changes. No-one writes chord changes like that.\" \"The Width of a Circle\" and \"The Supermen\", for example, were already in existence before the sessions began."

        "content": "The Man Who Sold the World was a departure from the largely acoustic and folk rock sound of Space Oddity. According to music critic Greg Kot, it marked Bowie's change of direction into hard rock. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as \"almost all hard blues rock or psychedelic folk rock\", while Doggett writes that it is \"filled with propulsive hard rock\". Much of the material has a distinct heavy metal edge that distinguishes it from Bowie's other releases, and has been compared to contemporary acts such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. According to Marc Spitz, Ronson was intent to make a heavy blues album \"worthy of Cream.\" Like the music, the lyrics are significantly darker than its predecessor. According to Doggett, they contain numerous themes that Bowie would continue to explore throughout the rest of the 1970s decade, including \"madness, alienation, violence, confusion of identity, power, darkness and sexual possession\". The lyrics have also been seen as reflecting the influence of such figures as Aleister Crowley, Franz Kafka and Friedrich Nietzsche. Since Bowie wrote most of the lyrics at the last minute, O'Leary writes that The Man Who Sold the World is a more \"coherent\" concept album than his fifth and eighth albums, Ziggy Stardust (1972) and Diamond Dogs (1974), respectively. He continues, saying that the songs \"mirror and answer each other\", sharing similar themes and imagery."

        "content": "The opening track, \"The Width of a Circle\", is an eight-minute epic that delves into progressive rock. Originally debuted in February 1970 at a BBC session, the song is led by Ronson's widely lauded guitar work, using feedback and improvisation throughout. The lyrics reference the Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran and in the song's second half, the narrator has a sexual encounter with God in the devil's lair. Pegg describes the song's sound as reminiscent of Deep Purple and Black Sabbath. The lyrics of \"All the Madmen\" were inspired by Bowie's half-brother Terry Burns and reflect the theme of institutionalised madness. The song contains a recorder part that creates an atmosphere, which Buckley describes as \"childlike dementia\". Doggett describes the Moog synthesiser as an integral part of the recording, noting that it gives the track a \"stunning conclusion\". Spitz calls the track \"terrifying\". For \"Black Country Rock\", Bowie had a small portion of the melody and four quickly-written lines that he gave to Ronson and Visconti, who expanded upon them to create the song. A blues rock and hard rock song, Bowie impersonates Marc Bolan in his vocal performance. \"After All\" is musically different than the rest of The Man Who Sold the World, being more akin to folk rock than hard rock. Featuring an \"oh, by jingo\" chant that is reminiscent of music hall numbers, the lyrics follow a group of innocent children who have not experienced the corruptions of adulthood. Similar to \"The Supermen\", the song references the works of Nietzsche and has been described by Buckley and Pegg as an underrated gem."

        "content": "The lyrics of \"Running Gun Blues\" discuss gun-toting assassins and Vietnam War commentary, specifically the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre of 1968. Although the lyrics reflect the themes of Space Oddity, the music reflects the predominant hard rock style of The Man Who Sold the World  and points to Bowie's future musical direction. Similar to the previous track, \"Saviour Machine\" is rooted in blues rock and hard rock. The lyrics explore the concept of computers overtaking the human race; Bowie's metallic-like vocal performance enhances the scenario. Like the majority of the tracks, \"She Shook Me Cold\" was mostly created by Ronson, Visconti and Woodmansey without Bowie's input. Spitz compares the song's blues style to Led Zeppelin, while O'Leary and Pegg write that Ronson was attempting to emulate Cream's Jack Bruce. The lyrics explores a sexual conquest that is similar to \"You Shook Me\" (then-recently covered by Jeff Beck) and Robert Johnson's \"Love in Vain\". The album's title track has been described by multiple reviewers as \"haunting\". Musically, it is based around a \"circular\" guitar riff from Ronson. The lyrics are cryptic and evocative, being inspired by numerous poems, including \"Antigonish\" (1899) by William Hughes Mearns. The narrator has an encounter with a kind of doppelg\u00e4nger, as suggested in the second chorus where \"I never lost control\" is replaced with \"We never lost control\". Bowie's vocals are heavily \"phased\" throughout and contain none of the, in Doggett's words, \"metallic theatrics\" that are found on the rest of the album. The song also features g\u00fciro percussion, which Pegg describes as \"sinister\". \"The Supermen\" prominently reflects the themes of Nietzsche, particularly his theory of \u00dcbermensch, or \"Supermen\". Like other tracks on the album, the song is predominantly hard rock. It was described by Bowie in 1973 as a \"period piece\", and later \"pre-fascist\"."

        "content": "The original 1970 US release of The Man Who Sold the World employed a cartoon-like cover drawing by Bowie's friend Michael J. Weller, featuring a cowboy in front of Cane Hill asylum. Weller, whose friend was a patient there, suggested the idea after Bowie had asked him to create a design that would capture the music's foreboding tone. Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, Weller used a photograph of actor John Wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten-gallon hat and holding a rifle, which was meant to be an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to include the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"\u2014a pun on record players, guns, and drug use\u2014but Mercury found the idea too risqu\u00e9 and the balloon was left blank. According to Pegg, \"at this point, [Bowie's] intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis; the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man Who Sold the World\". Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance. The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish. It has been said that Bowie's \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo were inspired by a Pre-Raphaelite painting by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. In the United States, Mercury rejected MacMillan's photo and released the album with Weller's design as its cover, much to the displeasure of Bowie, although he successfully lobbied the record label to use the photo for the release in the United Kingdom. In 1972, he said Weller's design was \"horrible\" but reappraised it in 1999, saying he \"actually thought the cartoon cover was really cool\". While promoting The Man Who Sold the World in the US, Bowie wore the Fish dress in February 1971 on his first promotional tour and during interviews, despite the fact that the Americans had no knowledge of the then-unreleased UK cover. The 1971 German release's artwork presented a winged hybrid creature with Bowie's head and a hand for a body, preparing to flick the Earth away. The 1972 worldwide reissue by RCA Records used a black-and-white picture of Ziggy Stardust on the sleeve. The image remained the cover art on reissues until 1990 when the Rykodisc release reinstated the UK \"dress\" cover.  The \"dress\" cover has appeared on subsequent reissues of the album. In 2011, when the Victoria and Albert Museum in London was putting together the list of Bowie artifacts for the David Bowie Is show, the curators asked for the dress to display, but found that the dress had gone missing from Bowie's collection."

It was subsequently released in the UK on 10 April 1971 by Mercury, with the catalogue number 6338 041.  Bowie was initially aggravated that Mercury had retitled the album from his preferred title of Metrobolist without his consultation, but following its release in the US, Bowie attempted to persuade the label to retitle the album Holy Holy after his newly released single of the same name. Following the commercial flop of \"Holy Holy\", the title remained The Man Who Sold the World for the UK release. According to Cann, the album was disliked by Mercury executives. However, it was played on US radio stations frequently and the \"heavy rock content\" increased interest in Bowie. Cann also writes that The Man Who Sold the World developed an underground following and laid \"solid foundations\" for Ziggy Stardust. None of the songs from the album were released as singles at the time, although a promo version of \"All the Madmen\" was issued in the US in 1970. Mercury released \"All the Madmen\" as a single, with \"Janine\" from Space Oddity on the B-side, with the catalogue number Mercury 73173, but withdrew it. The same song appeared in Eastern Europe during 1973, as did \"The Width of a Circle\". \"Black Country Rock\" was released as the B-side of \"Holy Holy\" in the UK in January 1971, shortly before the release of The Man Who Sold the World.

Music publications Melody Maker and NME originally found The Man Who Sold the World \"surprisingly excellent\" and \"rather hysterical\", respectively. Reviewing for Rolling Stone in February 1971, John Mendelsohn called the album \"uniformly excellent\" and commented that Visconti's \"use of echo, phasing, and other techniques on Bowie's voice\u00a0... serves to reinforce the jaggedness of Bowie's words and music\", which he interpreted as \"oblique and fragmented images that are almost impenetrable separately but which convey with effectiveness an ironic and bitter sense of the world when considered together\". Colman Andrews of Phonograph Record felt that record was a mixed bag, finding the lyrics both good and bad and Bowie's voice to be undistinguishable from other British artists, but his vocal performance to be well done. Overall, Andrews stated, \"[The Man Who Sold the World] TRIES to define some new province of modern music, even if it's not completely successful. For that alone it deserves some attention.\" Mike Saunders from Who Put the Bomp magazine included The Man Who Sold the World in his ballot of 1971's top 10 albums for the first annual Pazz & Jop poll of American critics, published in The Village Voice in February 1972. Retrospectively, the album has been praised for the band's performance and the unsettling nature of its music and lyrics. In a review for AllMusic, Erlewine complimented its \"tight, twisted heavy guitar rock that appears simple on the surface but sounds more gnarled upon each listen\". He viewed its music and Bowie's \"paranoid futuristic tales\" as \"bizarre\", adding that: \"Musically, there isn't much time for innovation\u00a0...but there's an unsettling edge to the band's performance, which makes the record one of Bowie's best albums.\" In a review upon the album's reissue, a writer for Q called it \"a robust, sexually charged affair\", while a Mojo columnist wrote, \"A robust set that spins with dizzying disorientation\u00a0... Bowie's armoury was being hastily assembled, though it was never deployed with such thrilling abandon again.\" Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork called the album the \"dark horse\" of Bowie's catalogue. Comparing The Man Who Sold the World to its predecessor, he praised the arrangements as tougher and \"more effective\", and complimented his artistic growth."

In August 1970, Visconti parted ways with Bowie owing to his dislike of Defries and his frustration with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the making of The Man Who Sold the World; it was the last time he would see the artist for three or four years. Ronson and Woodmansey also departed due to other personal conflicts with Bowie. Despite his annoyance with Bowie during the sessions, Visconti still rated The Man Who Sold the World as his best work with him until his fourteenth studio album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980). Although his new single \"Holy Holy\", recorded in November 1970 and released in January 1971,  was a commercial flop, the single earned Bowie a contract with music publisher Chrysalis. The critical success of the album in the US prompted Mercury to send Bowie on a promotional radio tour of the country in February 1971. Upon his return, he wrote the majority of the material that would appear on the follow-up albums Hunky Dory (1971) and Ziggy Stardust. Bowie also convened with Ronson and Woodmansey, who returned to play on both records. Following the commercial disappointment of Hunky Dory, Bowie finally found commercial success with Ziggy Stardust in 1972. Ronson and Woodmansey, along with bassist Trevor Bolder, would become famous as the Spiders from Mars."

        "content": "The Man Who Sold the World has been retrospectively described by Bowie's biographers and commentators as the beginning of Bowie's artistic growth, with many also agreeing that it was his first album where he began to find his sound. Buckley has described the album as \"the first Bowie album proper\", while NME critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray similarly stated, \"this is where the story really starts\". Erlewine cited The Man Who Sold the World as the beginning of Bowie's \"classic period\". Similarly, Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club called the album his \"career blueprint\", writing that it musically was a forerunner to the \"swaggering electric disorientation\" of Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane (1973), but its greater importance on sequencing and atmosphere, as well as stonger songwriting, predated Hunky Dory. Meanwhile, Paul Trynka calls it Bowie's \"first truly gripping work\". Pegg calls The Man Who Sold the World one of the best and most important albums in the history of rock music. In a 2013 readers' poll for Rolling Stone, it was voted Bowie's tenth greatest album. The album has since been cited as inspiring the goth rock, dark wave and science fiction elements of work by artists such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Cure, Gary Numan, John Foxx and Nine Inch Nails. It has been claimed that glam rock began with the release of The Man Who Sold the World, though this is also attributed to Bolan's appearance on the UK television programme Top of the Pops in March 1971 wearing glitter. In his journal, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana listed it at number 45 on his top 50 favourite albums list. The title track provided an unlikely hit for Scottish pop singer Lulu, which was produced by Bowie and Ronson, and would be covered by many artists over the years, including Richard Barone in 1987, and Nirvana in 1993 for their live album MTV Unplugged in New York."

        "content": "The Man Who Sold the World was first released on CD by RCA in 1984. The album was reissued by Rykodisc/EMI in 1990 with bonus tracks, including a 1971 rerecording of \"Holy Holy\" that had originally been issued as a B-side in 1974. \"Holy Holy\" was incorrectly described in the liner notes as the original single version recorded in 1970.  Bowie vetoed inclusion of the earlier recording, and the single remained its only official release until 2015, when it was included on Re:Call 1, part of the Five Years (1969\u20131973) compilation. Additionally, the liner notes incorrectly listed the personnel for \"Lightning Frightening\" as those who played with Bowie during the Space Oddity period, when in fact the personnel were members of the Arnold Corns sessions proto-group. In 1999, The Man Who Sold the World was reissued again by Virgin/EMI, without the bonus tracks but with 24-bit digitally remastered sound. In 2015, the album was remastered for the Five Years (1969\u20131973) box set. It was released on CD, vinyl and digital formats, both as part of the compilation and separately. On 6 November 2020, the album was reissued by Parlophone under its working title of Metrobolist to commemorate its 50th anniversary. The reissue featured an updated version of the original Weller artwork as its official cover. For this release, Visconti remixed every song, except \"After All\", because he felt the original mix (as remastered in 2015) was \"perfect as is\". In 2021, a companion 2-CD set called The Width of a Circle was announced to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the British release. A press notice stated that the collection, released on 28 May, will \"feature non-album singles, a BBC In Concert session, music for a TV play and further Visconti remixes wrapping up (Bowie's) recordings from 1970 and revealing the first sonic steps toward Hunky Dory\"."

It is an annalistic chronicle that serves as a continuation of Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s Historia Regum Britanniae. Brut y Tywysogion has survived as several Welsh translations of an original Latin version, which has not itself survived. The most important versions are the one in Robert Vaughan's Peniarth MS. 20 and the slightly less complete one in the Red Book of Hergest. The version entitled Brenhinoedd y Saeson (Kings of the English) combines material from the Welsh annals with material from an English source. The Peniarth MS. 20 version begins in 682 with a record of the death of Cadwaladr and ends in 1332. The entries for the earlier years are brief, usually records of deaths and events such as eclipses, plagues or earthquakes, but later entries are much more detailed. The main focus is on the rulers of the kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys and Deheubarth, but ecclesiastical events are also mentioned, such as the bringing of the date of celebrating Easter in the Welsh church into line with Rome by \"Elbodius\" (Elfodd), Bishop of Bangor, in 768. Events in England, Ireland, Scotland and sometimes France are also briefly chronicled. The original monastic annals are thought to have been written at Strata Florida Abbey, but may have been kept at the old abbey at Llanbadarn Fawr in the 11th century. Annals from other abbeys were also used in the composition. At least one of the Welsh translations is also thought to have been written at Strata Florida."

The album was nominated for the 1997 Mercury Prize. A commercial and critical success, Coming Up was the second by the band to reach no. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, producing five top ten singles and receiving a favourable reception at home and in the US.

Determined to bring Suede back into the mainstream, frontman Brett Anderson decided that the sound of the new album would be the complete opposite of Dog Man Star. \"I think the next album will be quite simple, actually. I'd really like to write a straightforward pop album. Just ten hits.\" The guitarist to replace Butler was the 17-year-old Richard Oakes, who beat 500 other applicants for the role. Instead of applying for the job like everyone else, Oakes was auditioned on the strength of an impromptu demo tape he sent to the Suede fan club. Despite Oakes' smooth integration into his new role and the band's rejuvenated spirit, Anderson was tired of touring and was keen to get back in the studio with his new songwriting partner. He recalled: \"it was becoming really not much fun touring an album that wasn't made by the band.\" At the time Suede were fatigued with being on tour, which was reflected in the B-side, \"Have You Ever Been This Low\"."

        "title": "Coming Up (album)_Recording",
        "content": "After some hesitation over who was going to produce the album, the band decided to continue with long-time producer Ed Buller due to their strong working relationship over the years. Other candidates the band considered were Flood and Brian Eno, however they could not fit the band into their schedules. Buller had in fact welcomed a parting of the ways due to the fractious relationship between the band members during the recording of the last album. However, in friendly discussions with Anderson, Buller found that his ideas about a possible new Suede direction tallied almost exactly with the band's own: to write less complex, more immediate songs; to use heavier drum sounds, play fewer guitar solos and only employ string sections on a couple of songs such as \"She\" and \"The Chemistry Between Us.\" The album was recorded between December 1995 and June 1996 at various locations. To prepare for its recording, the band had immersed themselves in T. Rex's 1972 album The Slider and its successor, Tanx; as Buller stated that his aspiration was to make \"The Slider for the Nineties.\" T. Rex became the blueprint of the recording process, as the band spent a month at The Town House just working on drums. Buller explained how the recording process worked: \"Basically, what we did, is that every track started with acoustic guitar, bongos, tambourine and Brett [Anderson], so it all started life pretty much the same way that Marc Bolan recorded all of his stuff originally.\" Bass player Mat Osman recalls how Buller was keen on making the album simple. \"He was really keen on using all those devices: the big repeated end, the handclaps, the straightforward chorus, make it big and obvious.\" In an interview on the eve of the album's release, Anderson stated: \"I wanted it to be a complete turnover from the last album, which was very dark and dank\u00a0... I wanted it to be communicative and understandable.\" Two songs which made it onto Coming Up had already been written in the early days of Suede. \"Lazy\" and \"By the Sea\" were two of Anderson's own compositions. \"By the Sea\" was actually written when Suede were recording their first album, which is why the song's opening line is similar to \"So Young\". Unlike the tense and chaotic recording of Dog Man Star, which according to Anderson was mostly written \"by post\", in a shift-like format, the new material was far more celebratory in both its development and execution. As opposed to the previous album which followed a stringent pattern of Butler composing music for Anderson's lyrics, Coming Up was a more collaborative project. Anderson stated: \"Coming Up was more of a meritocracy \u2013 if something was good enough, it didn't matter what the source was.\" Songs such as \"By the Sea\" and \"She\" required the use of keyboards. Faced with the problem as to how to play them live, Suede recruited Simon Gilbert's cousin Neil Codling, who made his debut at a fan-club gig in January 1996. Buller has stated that the reason why the album has a much better sound than the previous albums is that he had minimal involvement in the mixing process, mixing only two songs. Buller credits much of the album's success to Dave Bascombe, who mixed the majority of the songs. According to Buller, having an outside observer mix the record with \"fresh ears\" enhances the overall production quality. Bascombe's input on \"Trash\" was crucial, as it was his idea to speed up the vocals. One of Suede's popular B-sides \"Young Men\" was left off the album, as Buller felt it was \"too dark\" and not as \"poppy [and] in your face\" as other songs on the record."

Its singles were much more successful than those of their second LP, while the lyrical content concerns the band's disaffection at the mid-90s hedonistic, celebrity-obsessed culture; \"Beautiful Ones\" and \"She\" are caricatures of British yuppies, celebrities and heroin-chic models. \"Beautiful Ones\" was originally titled \"Dead Leg\" after Osman threatened to give Oakes a dead leg if he was unable to write a top ten single. According to Anderson, \"The Chemistry Between Us\" is about \"the emptiness of it all\", when it comes to taking drugs with strangers who have no common ground other than being high on drugs. The main refrain of the song is \"Class A, Class B, is that the only chemistry between us.\""

James Delingpole of The Daily Telegraph wrote: \"Coming Up is their defiant reminder of what made Suede so special [...] If Dog Man Star was Diamond Dogs, then this is Suede's Ziggy Stardust \u2013 extravagant, steeped in glam and unashamedly poppy.\" Roy Wilkinson of Select called it: \"a wondrous pop album, simultaneously immediate and full of scope, a lovely, charming mix of absolute beauty and the thrillingly awkward.\" Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian felt that even despite the album's simplistic composition of \"vibrant three-minute howla-longs\", it still manages to avoid being too mainstream and incomparable to rivals Oasis and Blur. Andy Gill of The Independent, however was a harsh critic of the album. In contrast to the band's earlier work, he wrote: \"two albums and one guitarist later, they sound utterly mined out.\" He added: \"in many ways, it's a step back from Dog Man Star \u2013 and their manner grows increasingly obnoxious.\" Despite its success in the UK and Europe, Coming Up did not win an audience in America, partially because of its later release in April 1997 and partially because Suede only supported it with a three-city tour. Critical reception, however was generally positive stateside. Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle wrote: \"Oakes more than fills the boots of his predecessor, and the new CD is a pure pop pleasure, thick and sinewy and terribly,  British.\" Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club had similar views, saying: \"The London Suede should, by all laws of musical logic, have disappeared by now. However, after surviving a name change, the replacement of co-songwriter/guitarist Bernard Butler with an obscure 17-year old, and more than a few changes in musical fashion, the band has returned with a third album that's more consistent and accessible than anything it's produced before.\" James Hunter of Spin said that \"the band pushes its case by ascending to heights of absolutely lucid songcraft that, in this often fuzzy era, feels exhilarating.\" Rolling Stone critic Elysa Gardner noted their \"concise melodies and taut, brashly energetic arrangements\". Other critics were favourable, however with the caveat of highlighting the album's simplicity. In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote: \"The most striking thing about Coming Up is the simplicity [...] As a statement of purpose, Coming Up is unimpeachable. Though it doesn't break any new ground for the band \u2014 unless you count the new-found sense of optimism.\" With similar views, Kevin Courtney of The Irish Times wrote: \"Sometimes the songs seem a little too simple and throwaway, but Anderson tosses them aside with such aplomb, you can't wait to pick up after him.\" Suede embarked on a short tour of the US and Canada in May 1997 to support the album, but fell upon bad fortune when their equipment got stolen after playing a sold-out show in Boston, Massachusetts on 17 May."

Under Prouvost the magazine expanded its focus beyond sports, to a format reminiscent of Life : Le Match de la vie (\"The Match of Life\") and then Match, l\u2019hebdomadaire de l'actualit\u00e9 mondiale (\"Match, the weekly of world news\"). Following the outbreak of World War II it became Match de la guerre (\"Match of War\") in October 1939. Selling for 2 francs a copy, it reached a circulation of 1.45 million by November.  Publication was halted on 6 June 1940, during the Battle of France. The magazine was relaunched in 1949 with a new name, Paris Match. The magazine temporarily ceased its publication between 18 May and 15 June 1968 upon the call for a strike by the Syndicat du Livre, the French Printers\u2019 Union. In 1976 Daniel Filipacchi purchased the ailing Paris Match, and it continues to be one of France's most successful and influential magazines. It is published weekly and is now part of Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias, which is itself owned by the Lagard\u00e8re Group. On occasion, Paris Match has sold more than one million copies worldwide when covering major events, such as the first flight by a French astronaut aboard the U.S. Space Shuttle in June 1985. Beno\u00eet Clair, a senior writer for Paris Match, was the first journalist allowed to join the shuttle crew members from training until the departure for the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. A series of reports on the training was published in Paris Match on 22 April 1985, 17 June 1985 and 20 January 1986. As of 1996 the magazine had an independent political stance."

        "content": "The setting is the east shore of the Caspian Sea (modern Turkmenistan) where the Red Army soldier Fyodor Sukhov has been fighting the Civil War in Russian Asia for a number of years. The movie opens with a panoramic shot of a bucolic Russian countryside. Katerina Matveyevna, Sukhov's beloved wife, is standing in a field. Awakening from this daydream, Sukhov is walking through the Central Asian desert \u2013 a stark contrast to his homeland. He finds Sayid buried in the sand. Sayid, an austere Central Asian, comes to Sukhov's rescue in sticky situations throughout the movie. Sukhov frees Sayid, and they strike a friendly but reticent relationship. While traveling together they are caught up in a desert fight between a Red Army cavalry unit and Basmachi guerrillas. The cavalry unit commander, Rakhimov, leaves to Sukhov the harem, which was abandoned by the Basmachi leader Abdullah, for temporary protection. He also leaves a young Red Army soldier, Petrukha, to assist Sukhov with the task, and proceeds to pursue the fleeing Abdullah. Sukhov and women from Abdullah's harem return to a nearby shore village. There, Sukhov charges the local museum's curator with protecting the women, and prepares to head home. Sukhov hopes to \"modernize\" the wives of the harem, and make them part of the modern society. He urges them to take off their burqa and reject polygamy. The wives are loath to do this, though, and as Sukhov takes on the role of protector, the wives declare him their new husband. Soon, looking for a seaway across the border, Abdullah and his gang come to the same village and find Abdullah's wives. Sukhov is bound to stay. Hoping to obtain help and weapons, Sukhov and Petrukha visit Pavel Vereschagin, a former Tsar's customs official. Vereschagin warms to Petrukha who reminds him of his dead son, but after discussing the matter with his nagging wife, Vereschagin refuses. Sukhov finds a machine gun and a case of dynamite that he plants on Abdullah's ship. Meanwhile, Abdullah has confronted his wives, and is preparing to punish them for their \"dishonor\", as they did not kill themselves when Abdullah left them. Sukhov manages to capture and lock Abdullah as a hostage, but after he leaves, Abdullah convinces Gyulchatai, the youngest wife of the harem, to free him and then kills Gyulchatai and Petrukha. The museum curator shows Sukhov an ancient underground passage that leads to the sea. Sukhov and the women of the harem attempt to escape through the passage, but on arriving at the seashore they are impelled to hide in a large empty oil tank. Abdullah discovers that and plans on setting the oil tank on fire. Enraged at the cold-hearted murder of Petrukha, Vereschagin decides to help Sukhov and takes Abdullah's ship. Sayid also helps Sukhov, and together they fend off Abdullah's gang. Vereschagin, unaware of the dynamite on the ship and not hearing Sukhov's shouted warnings, tragically dies on the exploding ship. Sukhov kills Abdullah and his gang, and returns the harem to Rakhimov. He then begins his journey home on foot, having refused a horse since a horse is merely \"a nuisance\". Whether Sukhov will make it home to his beloved wife is unclear: the revolution is not over in Central Asia, and an exemplary Red Army soldier like Sukhov may well be needed."

        "content": "Anatoly Kuznetsov as Fyodor Ivanovich Sukhov \u2013 a Red Army soldier, who returns home on foot through the desert after recovering in a hospital from wounds sustained in the war. He shows much wisdom and skill in his actions and a gentle human side in his graphical dreams, in which he mentally writes letters to his beloved wife. Georgi Yumatov was chosen for the role, but was dismissed for a drunken brawl right before the shooting. Therefore, Motyl called for Kuznetsov, who was the second choice during the selection. Pavel Luspekayev as Pavel Vereschagin \u2013 a former tsarist customs official. Vereschagin lives a lonely life as the only Russian, along with his wife, in a remote village. The walls of his house are covered with pictures of the military campaigns where he was awarded and wounded. The Civil War has left him without an official job and a place to go. He is a big man and a straightforward person with a tendency for alcoholism due to the nostalgia for his past. He has an arsenal of weapons that brings both conflicting parties (Sukhov and Abdullah's men) to his house at some point in the film. Initially neutral, he eventually takes the side of Sukhov. This was Luspekayev's last role. A World War II veteran and an experienced stage actor, both of his feet were amputated in the 1960s due to past injuries. Given Luspekayev's condition, Motyl wrote a script for a man on crutches. Luspekayev refused, arguing that his character should appear not as a cripple, but as a strong person who died prematurely. While filming, he walked on prosthetic legs and had to take regular rests due to pain. He died in 1970. Spartak Mishulin as Sayid \u2013 a skilled man of few words. He seeks revenge on Dzhavdet, a Basmachi gang leader who killed his father, robbed his family and buried him in sand for a slow death; otherwise his motives and reactions are unclear and unexpected. For example, after Sukhov dug him out, Sayid, instead of thanking him, says, \"Why did you dig me out? There will be no rest while Dzhavdet is alive.\" Sayid suddenly appears every now and then to help Sukhov against bandits, but when asked why, simply replies that he has \"heard shooting,\" giving an impression that he just seeks Dzhavdet via any armed conflict nearby. His relationship with Sukhov is well described by the following dialogue: In contrast with Luspekayev, this was one of the first movie roles for Mishulin, although he was previously active as a TV and stage actor. Kakhi Kavsadze as Abdullah \u2013 a cunning Basmachi leader with no respect for human life. Both he and Sayid originate from poor families, and their fathers were friends. However, contrary to Sayid, Abdullah took the path of banditry. Kavsadze, a Georgian by nationality, fit very well into the role of an Asian gang leader. However, he had never ridden a horse, while his character was supposed to be a keen horse rider. He never actually rides in the film, but only sits on a horse, or even on the shoulders of an assistant. Nikolai Godovikov as Petrukha \u2013 a young Red Army soldier. He attempts to court Gyulchatai, aiming to start a family. Coincidentally, Godovikov started dating Denisova (one of the actresses who played Gyulchatai) after filming. Raisa Kurkina as Nastasia, Vereschagin's wife \u2013 Vereschagin's life partner, a homemaker who balances his mental instability. Galina Luchai as Katerina Matveyevna, Sukhov's wife \u2013 she appears in the film only through Sukhov's dreams, to elaborate his character."

Sayid is found barehanded in the beginning; he acquires all his weapons through the film and uses them skillfully. Sukhov gives him a knife, which Sayid later throws to kill an attacker. He shoots a carbine taken from a bandit, whom he strangled using rope as a lasso (while helping Sukhov). His skills in riding are demonstrated when he jumps on a horse, back first, while walking backwards and keeping his enemy at gunpoint. He then slowly rides away, sitting backwards on the horse. Vereschagin, despite having an arsenal of small arms, fights barehanded, which accentuates his brute force and straightforwardness. Both Sukhov and Abdullah use handguns rather than rifles, as appropriate to their leading, officer-like positions. Sukhov carries a Nagant M1895 revolver, a personal gift from brigade commander M. N. Kovun, whereas Abdullah uses a Mauser C96. To deal with Abdullah's gang, Sukhov fetches and fixes a machine gun. Petrukha has a rifle that jams and never fires when needed. Abdullah's gang members carry carbines and long knives characteristic of the time and region."

        "content": "The director, Vladimir Motyl, said such films as Stagecoach and High Noon influenced him and he has described the film as being a \"cocktail\" of both an adventurous Russian folktale and a western. Initially several directors, including Andrei Tarkovsky and Andrei Konchalovsky, were offered the film but they turned it down, Motyl claims, for two main reasons. Firstly, Konchalovsky thought only American actors could pull off the part of a lead role in a western, and secondly the screenplay was considered weak. Motyl also initially turned down the offer, but then found himself in a no-choice situation, as he would not be given any other film to direct. After the first version of the film was turned down by Mosfilm, Valentin Yezhov and Rustam Ibragimbekov were assigned to improve the script. Ibragimbekov was chosen by his nationality as an expert on the East, though in reality he was raised in Russia and never been in the region. A war veteran told Yezhov a story of a harem abandoned by a Basmachi leader on a run, which became the pivot of the new script. Further rewriting came from Motyl after he replaced Konchalovsky as director. Motyl completely reshaped and put forward the character of Vereschagin \u2013 all his dialogues, as well as about 60% of the entire script, were rewritten and improvised during the filming. Motyl also came up with the idea of revealing Sukhov's personality through his dreams, in which he writes letters to his beloved wife. Those letters were composed by Mark Zakharov, a friend of Motyl's. Years later, Konchalovsky praised the final script as a masterpiece."

        "content": "Sukhov's dream scenes were filmed first, near Luga, Leningrad Oblast, while the bulk of the film was shot on the western shore of the Caspian Sea near Makhachkala, Dagestan. The sand dune scenes were shot in the Karakum Desert near Mary, Turkmenistan, with the museum scenes filmed in the nearby ancient city of Merv. The distinctive Kyz Kala (Gyz Gala) fortress, for example, figures prominently. The dune scenes were demanding for actors, who had to make large circles in the scorching heat to approach the shooting location without leaving telltale traces in the sand. However, the heaviest burden fell on Mishulin, who spent in total several days in a box buried in sand while preparing for several takes of the opening scene. The village buildings and Vereschagin's house were temporary mockups that had to be regularly repaired due to damage from frequent winds. Horse riding scenes were performed by the special stunt unit formed for the War and Peace film series. Although it did not perform any stunts in this film, one member of the unit died in an accident during filming. Some other accidents occurred due to poor overall discipline and security. For example, a cut is seen on Vereschagin's face when he fights on the ship. He received this cut in a drunken brawl the day before. Also, some props were stolen by local thieves one night. Security was improved after Motyl hired a local criminal leader for the role of a member of Abdullah's gang. The film involved two dangerous stunts, the first when Abdullah's officer, supposedly thrown out by Vereschagin, breaks through a second-floor window and falls to the sand below. The other is when Sukhov jumps from an oil tank set on fire. Both stunts were performed by Valentin Faber."

Many of the songs are inspired by the 1960s urban song culture of metropolitan Russia. These songs are often just a voice and guitar, with the music drawing on traditional Russian folk music. \"Your Honor, Lady Luck\", sung by Vereschagin accompanied by a guitar, is a musical motif in the film. The lyrics talk about loneliness, humanity\u2019s dependence on luck, and hope for love. These lyrics mirror many of the film's central themes, including Vereschagin's sadness and Sukhov's separation from Katerina. The song was written by Okudzhava on personal request by Motyl, who had worked with him in the past. A line from this song, \"Nine grams to your heart, stop, don't call,\" is included as an homage in the script of the 1985 Soviet action film Independent Steaming (\u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435)."

Only in 1998 was it awarded the state prize by President Boris Yeltsin, being recognized as culturally significant. The film received limited attention in the West. It was shown at a Soviet film festival at the little Carnegie Theatre in 1973, meant to tie in with Leonid Brezhnev's visit to the United States. Other than that, it was not widely released.

As of August 2021, Ukrainian Wikipedia is the second most popular Wikipedia in Ukraine, well below Russian, despite that both language versions have more than a million articles. This is attributed to the historic bilingualism in Ukraine, the Russification of Ukraine and the Ukrainian language during the Tsarist and Soviet era, and the popularity of Russian-language content and media in present-day Ukraine. However, the popularity of Ukrainian Wikipedia in Ukraine is increasing every year, compared to the Russian version.

Don't Believe the Truth went triple platinum in the UK in the first week of 2006 (900,000+ sales), and in the US has sold more than 200,000 copies. As with the previous album, Don't Believe The Truth had significant writing contributions from members other than chief songwriter Noel Gallagher, and the album is the first where all duties were divided between the band members. On some of the tracks regular bass player Andy Bell handled guitar, while Gem Archer and Noel Gallagher contributed bass to other songs. Don't Believe the Truth is the first Oasis record to feature the drumming of Zak Starkey, an auxiliary member of Oasis, who performed and toured with them following the departure of longtime drummer Alan White, and appeared on the DVD praising all members' contributions. The album received positive reviews from critics, and many cited it as Oasis's best album in a decade. Liam Gallagher also had a larger impact on the album through his developing songwriting. Noel has said that the album is his favourite of Oasis' last four, because all members contributed to it. This, he claims, has given it a different feel from a typically Noel-written Oasis album. The band embarked on a massive worldwide tour that started off at the London Astoria for their Don't Believe the Truth Tour, visiting 26 countries and playing to 3.2\u00a0million people at a total of 113 concerts. This resulted in the making of Lord Don't Slow Me Down, a film later released on DVD. To date, the album has sold more than six million copies worldwide."

        "content": "The recording process for Don't Believe the Truth was prolonged. The album was originally supposed to be released around summer/autumn 2004, with an initial three to four-week session produced by Death in Vegas. The recording finally began after Alan White's departure in January 2004 at Sawmills Studios in Cornwall, though the group were not satisfied with the results, as Noel Gallagher said: \"Unfortunately, after the recording process we decided we didn't like anything we had played/recorded during those three weeks, and because of commitments with Death in Vegas, Richard Fearless and Tim Holmes couldn't find any more time to give to the project.\" Noel has commented since on numerous occasions that there was no problem with the work done by Death in Vegas, but he felt the songs they were working on were simply not good enough to form a record, and felt a break was needed in which new material would have to be written. In Noel's words: \"We were trying to polish a turd\". Around ten songs were worked on with Death in Vegas of which, according to Noel, six were \"not even good enough to make the b-sides\". Four of the tracks which eventually appeared on the album were worked on with Death in Vegas, those songs being: \"Turn Up the Sun\", \"Mucky Fingers\", \"A Bell Will Ring\" and \"The Meaning of Soul\", although all of these had extra work done to them or were re-recorded before being released. After a short break in which many new songs, including \"Let There Be Love,\" \"Lyla\" and \"Part of The Queue\" were written, the band reconvened at their Wheeler End Studios with Noel as producer. The band were joined on these sessions by The Who's drummer Zak Starkey. In June 2004, Oasis debuted two new songs from these sessions, the Liam-written \"The Meaning of Soul\" and the Gem-written \"A Bell Will Ring\" at two live shows in Poole and at the Glastonbury Festival. After hearing of the band's production problems from Oasis manager Marcus Russell, American producer Dave Sardy expressed interest in taking over production duties. Sardy was given tapes of existing recording sessions to mix, and after his work was praised by the band, he arrived in the UK to oversee new recording sessions at Olympic Studios in London. These sessions did not last long before he asked the band to travel to Los Angeles and re-record most of the album there, as he felt more comfortable working in a studio closer to home. With the band eventually agreeing to this, recording sessions began at Capitol Studios in November 2004 with the band spending around nine weeks there."

        "content": "The decision to have the lead-off single, \"Lyla\", on the album was a controversial one, prompted by the label's feeling that there wasn't a suitable lead single among the tracks originally presented. As a result, the decision was taken to record \"Lyla\", a song which Noel had written and demoed a year previously, but which wasn't recorded by the band during the previous recording sessions. It was decided that Dave Sardy would remix Noel's original demo with Liam recording a set of lead vocals and Zak adding a fresh drum track. \"Lyla\" reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and number nineteen on the US Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. After having initial reservations about the choice of the first single being taken out of the hands of the band, Noel, who initially wanted \"Mucky Fingers\" to be the first single, has now reluctantly conceded that the song has indeed \"done the business\". In April 2005, four tracks from a promo disc leaked: \"The Meaning of Soul\", \"Mucky Fingers\", \"Keep the Dream Alive\", and \"Let There Be Love\". The full album found its way onto the Internet on 3 May 2005 instead of 30 May, when Apple Inc. accidentally put the album up early for sale on their iTunes Music Store service in Germany. While there was no official comment by Apple or by Oasis management, it was speculated that Apple simply got the dates confused."

A break in recording for the band to play some November and December dates with Tank was followed by Clarke producing Tank's debut album with help from Will Reid Dick. Soon after, Maile left the Mot\u00f6rhead project, and there are conflicting explanations as to why. One is that Clarke was unhappy with the Maile produced sessions and decided that the album should be recorded themselves, although Lemmy lamented at the time that: However, in the Mot\u00f6rhead documentary The Guts and the Glory, Clarke insists that drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor refused to work with the producer after Maile got him an unsatisfactory drum sound, stating:"

It's very hard not to.\" The band undertook a UK tour from 17 March to 12 April with support from Tank. This was to be the first tour to drop the bomber lighting rig, with Lemmy feeling that they had \"to do something new sooner or later\" despite it being \"the best show I've ever seen in my life\". The rig was replaced by a gigantic iron fist that was supposed to unfold its hand but, as Lemmy explained to Uncut's John Robinson in 2015, it malfunctioned and made a \"rude gesture\" to the crowd. The band continued touring to promote the album, visiting North America in May and June, Japan at the end of June, and, after some summer festival appearances, mainland Europe in October and November. The first date of the North American tour, 12 May at C.N.E. Coliseum (now Ricoh Coliseum) in Toronto, was filmed and subsequently released on video as Live in Toronto and later as the bonus disc of the deluxe edition of the CD. In his 2002 autobiography White Line Fever, Lemmy recalls that at the Toronto show: Promotion for the album went as far as the May 1982 edition of Rennbahn Express, an Austrian magazine, which included a free flexidisc with excerpts from \"Iron Fist\", \"Sex and Outrage\", \"Don't Let 'em Grind You Down\", and \"Loser\". Lemmy is interviewed by Robert Reumann in English and is overdubbed with a German translation. The release of the album prompted Bronze/Mercury in Canada to issue The Complete Mot\u00f6rhead Kit, which featured a limited-edition 12-inch vinyl containing \"Iron Fist\", \"Too Late, Too Late\", \"Remember Me, I'm Gone\", \"Ace of Spades\" and \"Mot\u00f6rhead\" (from the No Sleep 'til Hammersmith album), plus a tour programme, a tour poster, and an embroidered patch of the band's logo."

        "content": "Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha helped found the weekly magazine Tygodnik Powszechny, whose first edition was published on 24 March 1945, during the closing months of World War II. Initially, its editorial staff had four people: Jan Piwowarczyk, a priest; Jerzy Turowicz, editor-in-chief for many years; Konstanty Turowski and Maria Czapska. Later, they were joined by Zofia Starowieyska\u2013Morstinowa, Stefan Kisielewski, Leopold Tyrmand, Antoni Go\u0142ubiew, Pawe\u0142 Jasienica (until he was arrested by the communists in 1948), Stanis\u0142aw Stomma, Hanna Malewska and J\u00f3zefa Golmont\u2013Hennelowa. In 1953, the weekly was suspended and lost its printing house after it had refused to print the obituary of Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. From 1953 to 1956, it was published by new editors, representing the pro-government PAX Association and was informally known as Tygodnik Paxowski. The same format was used and numbering was continuous during that period although none of the previous editors still worked for the paper. After the 1956 Polish October, the \"Thaw\" allowed the original editors were able to resume control of the magazine in December. Columnists have included prominent clerics, such as Karol Wojty\u0142a (later Pope John Paul II), academics and poets, journalists and other writers, including W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bartoszewski, Jerzy Zawieyski, Jacek Wo\u017aniakowski, Stefan Wilkanowicz, Adam Szostkiewicz, Leszek Ko\u0142akowski, Stanis\u0142aw Lem, Zbigniew Herbert, Wojciech Karpi\u0144ski, Tadeusz Kudli\u0144ski and Czes\u0142aw Zgorzelski. Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz published his poems in Tygodnik Powszechny for many years. In 1945, he prepared a handwritten volume of poems, Wiersze p\u00f3\u0142-perskie, for Jerzy Turowicz, the editor. Forced into exile to the United States, Mi\u0142osz continued to publish in the magazine. After he received the Nobel Prize, it was the only magazine in which Mi\u0142osz published his poems. In the late 1950s, the newspaper became affiliated with the officially recognized political party Znak, which was newly organized in the wake of the \"Thaw\". When Znak helped establish the Solidarity movement, Father J\u00f3zef Tischner, one of the writers of the Krakov edition, became its chaplain. After martial law was declared, the magazine suspended its publication for several months. Since 1982, Tygodnik Powszechny has been published continuously. After Wojty\u0142a was elected as Pope John Paul II, Tygodnik Powszechny became the most popular vehicle for his teachings in Poland. For a long time, it was the only magazine in the world to have gained an interview with the new pope, which was published 3 August 1980. In the 1980s, the magazine informally represented the Polish democratic opposition. It was sometimes regarded as the only legal oppositional magazine in the People's Republic of Poland (PRL). In 1987, it published a controversial essay by Jan B\u0142o\u0144ski, \"The Poor Poles Look at the Ghetto\" (\"Biedni Polacy patrz\u0105 na getto\"), which explored the historic relations between Catholic and Jewish Poles, and the experiences of the Holocaust during World War II. Since the 1990s, part of the church hierarchy has criticized Tygodnik Powszechny for what is considered to be its overly-liberal outlook. That does not reflect the parochial distribution of the magazine. In 1998, Maria Zmarz-Koczanowicz produced the documentary Ordinary Kindness (Zwyczajna dobro\u0107), which told the story of Turowicz. In 1999, after the death of Turowicz, the chief editor became Father Adam Boniecki. In April 2007, the ITI Group purchased 49% of the magazine. Since 5 December 2007, Tygodnik Powszechny has been published in a smaller size. Its format and editorial staff were also changed. In 2014, the magazine has changed its logo, layout and the format to attract younger readers."

It has presented an open ecumenical view of Polish Catholicism, called by the editors an 'open Catholicism'. Its goal is a dialogue.

According to the analysis by Jaros\u0142aw Gowin, presented in his book Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 w czasach wolno\u015bci (\"Church in the Times of Freedom\"), the magazine is one of the main representatives of \"open\" Catholicism, inspired by Catholic personalism Sergiusz Kowalski. Sergiusz Kowalski, who analysed the history of the journal from 1993 to 1995, wrote, \"The authors of Tygodnik Powszechny appreciate moderation, openness, readiness to dialogue and compromise, looking for a modus vivendi between liberal democracy and Church, between modernity and tradition\" (Kowalski 1997: 148)."

After 1989, the magazine was seen to represent one option in a dialogue within the Church that was called \"open Catholicism\", which received criticism from people of other circles. After 1989, Tygodnik Powszechny was believed to represent only one political party, the Democratic Union, which was later transformed into the Freedom Union. Many people involved in the magazine participated in the political changes of the era (J\u00f3zefa Hennelowa, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Krzysztof Koz\u0142owski). The critics of the Cracow weekly magazine often quote the letter written by John Paul II on 15 May 1995, on the occasion of the magazine's 50th anniversary: The year 1989 brought Poland deep changes connected with the downfall of the communist system. Resumption of independence paradoxically coincided with an increased assault of secular left-wing parties and liberal groups directed against the Church, the Episcopate as well as against the Pope. I felt it especially in the context of my last visit to Poland in 1991. The point was to erase from the memory of citizens what was the role of the Church in the nation within the space of the last years. Accusations and slanders about clericalism were multiplying as well as those about the alleged intention of the Church to rule Poland and about hindering political emancipation in the Polish society. Forgive me, if I say that those influences were also visible in Tygodnik Powszechny. In those difficult times, unfortunately the Church did not find in it any support and defense which in a way it could have expected: \u201cit did not feel cherished enough\u201d \u2013 like I once said.\u2013 Letter of 15 May 1995 from John Paul II to Jerzy Turowicz, editor-in-chief, Tygodnik Powszechny"

Years later, guitarist Joe Satriani enthused: \"'Since I've Been Loving You' was a perfect example of taking a blues structure but striking out on your own. They were breaking ground, not copying. I love that Page would always just go for it. Some other guitarist might have better technique, but what Page did would always trump it because the spirit was so overwhelming.

        "content": "The production of Mezzanine was a stressful process, and with tensions arising within the group, it almost split the band. They disagreed about the musical direction for the new material. As a demonstration of the project's sound, Robert Del Naja initially produced instrumental demos sampling songs by post-punk bands Wire and Gang of Four, who were familiar to him as artists he had listened to in his teenage years. Grant Marshall supported this idea as he wanted to depart from the \"urban soul\" of their previous album, Protection, but Andrew Vowles was sceptical. The sessions continued with Vowles and Marshall working on bass and drum loops, while Del Naja continued to produce demos; out of the latter's process, the group decided to release a new track, \"Superpredators\", extensively sampling Siouxsie and the Banshees' song \"Metal Postcard\", for the soundtrack to the 1997 film The Jackal. The track was subsequently included on the Japanese version of Mezzanine. The album marked the parting of Vowles due to creative conflicts, while reggae artist Horace Andy contributed to the album on multiple songs. The album was originally set to be released in December 1997, but was delayed by four months, with Del Naja spending most of the time in the studio \"making tracks, tearing them apart,  them up, panicking, then starting again.\" The album's working title was Damaged Goods, which was the name of Gang of Four's 1978 debut single. The cover art depicts a black stag beetle on a white background, photographed by Nick Knight at the Natural History Museum in London."

Musically, the album is a major departure from the jazzy and laidback sound of the first two albums, Blue Lines and Protection, invoking the dark undercurrents which had always been present in the collective's music. The album's textured and deep tone relies heavily on abstract and ambient sounds. Similar to their previous albums, several songs use one or more samples, ranging from Isaac Hayes to The Cure. In 1998, Manfred Mann sued Massive Attack for unauthorised use of a sample of the song \"Tribute\" from Manfred Mann's Earth Band's eponymous 1972 album, used on \"Black Milk\". The song has subsequently appeared as \"Black Melt\" on later releases and at live performances, with the sample removed. Later digital editions of Mezzanine have retained the original song, with Mann being added to the songwriting credits."

However, it failed to share the same success in North America, peaking at number 60 on the Billboard 200 and number 51 on the Canadian Albums Chart. The album received significant critical acclaim, which praised the collective's new sound. Rolling Stones Barney Hoskyns, although praising the album, pointed to its flaws: \"Sometimes rhythm and texture are explored at the expense of memorable tunes, and the absence of the bizarre Tricky [...] only highlights the flat, monotonous rapping of the group's 3-D.\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a two-star honorable mention rating and selected \"Risingson\" and \"Man Next Door\" as highlights. John Bush of AllMusic also had positive words for the album's song \"Inertia Creeps\", saying it \"could well be the highlight, another feature for just the core threesome. With eerie atmospherics, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen.\" Years after the album was released, it was placed on several best-of lists in the UK and the United States. In 2000, Q magazine placed Mezzanine at number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2013, it was placed at 215 on NMEs list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 412 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and while it was not included in the 2012 update of the list, it reentered the 2020 update ranked at number 383.

        "content": "The group was able to spend more studio time on this album than on their debut, combining strong song material by Bryan Ferry with more elaborate production treatments. For example, the song \"In Every Dream Home a Heartache\" (Ferry's sinister ode to a blow-up doll) fades out in its closing section, only to fade in again with all the instruments subjected to a pronounced phasing treatment. The title track fades out in an elaborate blend of tape loop effects. Brian Eno remarked that the eerie \"The Bogus Man\", with lyrics about a sexual stalker, displayed similarities with contemporary material by the krautrock group Can. Of the more upbeat numbers on the album, \"Do the Strand\" and \"Editions of You\" were both based around insistent rhythms in the tradition of the band's first single \"Virginia Plain\". \"Do the Strand\" has been called the archetypal Roxy Music anthem, whilst \"Editions of You\" was notable for a series of ear-catching solos by Andy Mackay (saxophone), Eno (VCS3), and Phil Manzanera (guitar). Eno is very present in the final song from the album \"For Your Pleasure\", making it unlike any other song on the album. The song ends with the voice of Judi Dench saying \"You don't ask. You don't ask why\" amid tapes of the opening vocals ('Well, how are you?') from \"Chance Meeting\" from the first Roxy Music album. A live recording of the song has been used in 1975 as a B-side to \"Both Ends Burning\". The original UK LP cover credits \"Produced by Chris Thomas and Roxy Music\" for the entire album, but only the side one label repeats that; the side two label credits \"Produced by John Anthony and Roxy Music\".

The album returned to the inclusion of vocal interludes between songs as last heard on their album So Tough and a more angular, electronic sound, particularly on tracks such as \"Action\", \"Shower Scene\" and \"New Thing\". \"Language Lab\" and \"Summerisle\" recall the ambient style of Sound of Water, while \"Stop and Think It Over\" would not have been out of place on Good Humor or its predecessor, Tiger Bay. The vocal interludes were supplied by Michael Jayston's narration as featured in the film released to accompany the album, also called Finisterre. The film was directed by Paul Kelly and Kieran Evans and was born out of visuals used to accompany certain tracks from the album shown during their live shows. The film debuted at a sold-out show in October 2002 at the Royal Festival Hall on London's Southbank, and was re-released to select screens in 2005. It is currently available on DVD. The album sleeve features a photograph of the East London tower block Ronan Point shortly after it collapsed in 1968 with the loss of four lives. Nitsuh Abebe of Pitchfork Media scored the album 7.6 out of ten and wrote that \"[t]he big comeback on Finisterres part is that they're tugging those strings again, confidently\", citing \"B92\" as a highlight.

The album was released in 1977 in two different versions, comprising a total of 30 songs by the Beatles. The performances were recorded on a home tape machine using a single microphone, resulting in a low fidelity recording. Ted \"Kingsize\" Taylor began to investigate possible marketing of the tapes in 1973. The tapes were eventually bought by Paul Murphy and subjected to extensive audio processing to improve the sound, leading to the 1977 album. Although the poor sound quality limits its commercial appeal, the album provides historic insight into the group's club act in the period after Ringo Starr joined but before the emergence of Beatlemania. The Beatles were unsuccessful in legally blocking the initial release of the album; the recordings were reissued in many forms until 1998, when the group were awarded full rights to the performances."

The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961 to play at the Top Ten Club for three months. A new Hamburg music venue, the Star-Club, opened on 13 April 1962, with The Beatles booked for the first seven weeks. The Beatles returned to Hamburg in November and December 1962 for their fourth and fifth engagements there, which had been booked for the Star-Club many months in advance. Unlike their previous three trips to Hamburg, their drummer was Starr, having replaced Best in August. The Beatles were reluctant to return for their final two-week booking, which started 18 December, as they were gaining popularity in Britain and had just achieved their first charted single with \"Love Me Do\"."

        "content": "Portions of The Beatles' final Star-Club performances (along with other acts) were recorded by the club's stage manager, Adrian Barber, for Ted \"Kingsize\" Taylor. Barber used a Grundig home reel-to-reel recorder at a tape speed of 3\u00be inches per second, with a single microphone placed in front of the stage. Taylor, leader of The Dominoes (who were also playing at the club), said that John Lennon verbally agreed to the group being recorded in exchange for Taylor providing the beer during their performances. The tapes were originally described as having been recorded in the spring of 1962, an attempt to pre-date The Beatles' June 1962 contract signing with Parlophone. However, song arrangements and dialogue from the tapes pointed to late December 1962, and a recording date of 31 December 1962 (the group's last day in Hamburg) was commonly cited. Later researchers have proposed that the tapes are from multiple days during the last week of December; The tapes captured The Beatles performing at least 33 different titles, plus some repeated songs. Of the 30 songs that were commercially released from the tapes, only two were Lennon\u2013McCartney compositions. The others were an assortment of cover versions, 17 of which would be re-made by The Beatles and appear on their various studio albums or Live at the BBC. The arrangements played at the Star-Club are similar to the versions recorded later, albeit less refined, although there are a few cases with distinct differences. For example, \"Mr. Moonlight\" has a much quicker tempo, a guitar-based instrumental break, and an intentionally altered lyric with Lennon proclaiming he is on his \"nose\" instead of his \"knees\"; \"Roll Over Beethoven\" was described as \"never taken at a more breakneck pace\". The recording equipment and method resulted in the tapes being unmistakably low fidelity. The vocals, even in the best cases, sound \"somewhat muffled and distant\". The vocals on a few songs are so indistinct that labelling and liner notes on early releases gave incorrect information about who was singing and the exact song being performed. Much of The Beatles' dialogue between songs is audible, which includes addressing the audience in both English and German, as well as repartee among themselves. The banter is irreverent and coarse at times, an aspect of their stage act that would soon cease under the influence of manager Brian Epstein."

Taylor said he kept the tapes at home, largely forgotten until 1973 when he decided to look into their marketability. Williams related a different history than Taylor, stating that after Taylor returned to Liverpool, he left the tapes with a recording engineer for editing into a potential album. The project was never finished and the engineer later relocated, with the tapes being among many items left behind. In 1972, Williams, Taylor, and the engineer gained access to the abandoned office and recovered the tapes \"from beneath a pile of rubble on the floor.\" When the existence of the tapes was first publicly reported in July 1973, Williams was planning to ask Apple for at least \u00a3100,000. Williams said he later met with George Harrison and Starr to offer the tapes for \u00a35,000, but they declined, citing financial difficulties at the time.

The sequence of songs was rearranged, and some of the individual songs were edited to bypass flawed tape sections or make up for an incomplete recording. After an unsuccessful attempt by The Beatles to block it, the 26-song Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 was released by Lingasong. The album first appeared in West Germany in April 1977 in association with Bellaphon Records, and was released in the UK the following month.

In 1979, Pickwick Records performed some additional audio filtering and equalisation of the songs on the Lingasong US version, and released it over two volumes as First Live Recordings; the set included the song \"Hully Gully\" that was mistakenly credited to The Beatles, but was actually performed by Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers, another act on the Star-Club bill. In 1981, Audio Fidelity Enterprises released Historic Sessions in the UK, the first single package with all 30 Beatles tracks from the original Star-Club releases. Several additional songs from the Star-Club tapes have appeared on Beatles bootleg records over the years. In 1985, a bootlegger known as \"Richard\", who had already found infamy by issuing several titles with controversial covers and content, issued his own bootleg version of the Star Club tapes without any of the editing found on the official releases, entitled The Beatles vs. the Third Reich\u2014directly parodying The Beatles vs. the Four Seasons in both name and cover. The release of the recordings on two CDs by industry giant Sony Music in 1991 sparked renewed legal attention by The Beatles (as represented by Paul McCartney, Harrison, Starr, and Yoko Ono). Sony also produced a version specifically for their Columbia House music club, but Sony withdrew the titles in 1992 as a lawsuit was progressing. Lingasong's CD release of the original set prompted another lawsuit from The Beatles in 1996; the case was decided in 1998 in favour of The Beatles, who were granted ownership of the tapes and exclusive rights to their use. Harrison appeared in person to provide evidence in the case, and his testimony was cited as an important factor in the judge's decision. Harrison characterised the claim that Lennon gave Taylor permission for the recording as \"a load of rubbish\", and added: \"One drunken person recording another bunch of drunks does not constitute business deals.\""

        "content": "HuffPost, formerly The Huffington Post until 2017 and sometimes abbreviated HuffPo, is an American news aggregator and blog, with localized and international editions. The site offers news, satire, blogs, and original content, and covers politics, business, entertainment, environment, technology, popular media, lifestyle, culture, comedy, healthy living, women's interests, and local news featuring columnists. It was created to provide a moderate liberal alternative to the conservative news websites such as the Drudge Report, and has since moved to the left by criticizing the George W. Bush administration, opposing the Iraq War, and supporting Barack Obama. The site offers content posted directly on the site as well as user-generated content via video blogging, audio, and photo. In 2012, the website became the first commercially run United States digital media enterprise to win a Pulitzer Prize. Founded by Andrew Breitbart, Arianna Huffington, Kenneth Lerer, and Jonah Peretti, the site was launched on May 9, 2005, as counterpart to the Drudge Report. In March 2011, it was acquired by AOL for US$315\u00a0million, making Arianna Huffington editor-in-chief. In June 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for US$4.4\u00a0billion and the site became a part of Verizon Media. In November 2020, BuzzFeed acquired the company. Several months after the acquisition, BuzzFeed laid off 47 HuffPost staff in the U.S. (mostly journalists) and closed down HuffPost Canada, laying off 23 staff working for the Canadian and Quebec divisions of the company."

        "content": "The Huffington Post was launched on May 9, 2005, as a commentary outlet, blog, and an alternative to news aggregators such as the Drudge Report. It was founded by Arianna Huffington, Andrew Breitbart, Kenneth Lerer, and Jonah Peretti. Prior to this, Arianna Huffington hosted the website Ariannaonline.com. Her first foray into the Internet was the website Resignation.com, which called for the resignation of President Bill Clinton and was a rallying place for conservatives opposing Clinton. An early Huffington Post strategy was crafting search-engine optimized (SEO) stories and headlines based around trending keywords, such as \"What Time Is the Super Bowl?\" In August 2006, The Huffington Post raised a $5\u00a0million Series A round from SoftBank Capital and Greycroft. In December 2008, The Huffington Post raised $25\u00a0million from Oak Investment Partners at a $100\u00a0million valuation and Fred Harman of Oak Investment Partners joined its board of directors. The money was to be used for technology, infrastructure, investigative journalism, and development of local versions. In June 2009, Eric Hippeau, co-managing partner of Softbank Capital, became CEO of The Huffington Post. In January 2011, The Huffington Post received 35% of its traffic from web search engines, compared to 20% at CNN. This strategy appealed to AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, who tried to implement similar SEO-driven journalism practices at AOL at the time of its acquisition of The Huffington Post. In March 2011, AOL acquired The Huffington Post for 315\u00a0million. As part of the deal, Huffington became president and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post and existing AOL properties Engadget, TechCrunch, Moviefone, MapQuest, Black Voices, PopEater (now HuffPost Celebrity), AOL Music, AOL Latino (now HuffPost Voices), AutoBlog, Patch, and StyleList. The Huffington Post subsumed many of AOL's Voices properties, including AOL Black Voices, which was established in 1995 as Blackvoices.com, and AOL Latino, Impact (launched in 2010 as a partnership between Huffington Post and Causecast), Women, Teen, College, Religion, and the Spanish-language Voces (en espa\u00f1ol). The Voices brand was expanded in September 2011 with the launch of Gay Voices, dedicated to LGBT-relevant articles. By late 2013, the website operated as a \"stand-alone business\" within AOL, taking control of more of its own business and advertising operations, and directing more effort towards securing \"premium advertising\". In June 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for US$4.4\u00a0billion and the site became a part of Verizon Media. Huffington resigned to pursue other ventures and was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Lydia Polgreen in December 2016. In April 2017, Polgreen announced the company would rebrand, changing its official full name to HuffPost, with changes also to the design of its website and logo and content and reporting. On January 24, 2019, 20 employees were laid off as a part of Verizon Media laying off 7% of its staff. The opinion and health sections were eliminated. Pulitzer Prize finalist Jason Cherkis lost his job. On March 6, 2020, Polgreen announced that she would step down as editor-in-chief to become the head of content at Gimlet Media. On November 19, 2020, it was announced that BuzzFeed had agreed to acquire HuffPost from Verizon Media in a stock deal. Later in November 2020, HuffPost shut down its India operation after six years. According to some media reports, the acquisition did not include the India site due to regulations barring foreign ownership of Indian Digital Media. On February 16, 2021, BuzzFeed's acquisition of HuffPost officially closed. On March 9, 2021, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti said that the company had lost \"around $20 million\" during the previous year. The same day, it was announced that HuffPost Canada would be shut down and immediately ceased publishing. On April 12, 2021, Danielle Belton became editor-in-chief."

In March 2011, the strike and the call to boycott was joined and endorsed by the National Writers Union and NewsGuild-CWA; however, the boycott was dropped in October 2011. In April 2011, The Huffington Post was targeted with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit by Jonathan Tasini on behalf of thousands of uncompensated bloggers. On March 30, 2012, the suit was dismissed with prejudice by the court, holding that the bloggers had volunteered their services, their compensation being publication. In 2015, Wil Wheaton stated that he refused to allow his work to be reused for free on the site. The practice of publishing blog posts from unpaid contributors ended in January 2018. This transformed the site, which had become notable for featuring extensive sections in a broad range of subjects from a significant number of contributors. Some of the contributors included:"

Editors later removed the article at the author's request. Political stanceHuffPost has been seen as a mostly liberal or liberal-leaning outlet, being described as such by the BBC, CNN, and Politico. Upon becoming the editor-in-chief in December 2016, Lydia Polgreen said that the \"wave of intolerance and bigotry that seems to be sweeping the globe\" after the election of Donald Trump were remarkable and The Huffington Post has an \"absolutely indispensable role to play in this era in human history.\" Commenting in 2012 on increased conservative engagement on the website despite its reputation as a liberal news source, The Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington stated that her website is \"increasingly seen\" as an Internet newspaper that is \"not positioned ideologically in terms of how we cover the news\". According to Michael Steel, press secretary for Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner, Republican aides \"engage with liberal websites like The Huffington Post [anyway, if for] no other reason than [because] they drive a lot of cable coverage\". Jon Bekken, journalism professor at Suffolk University, has cited it as an example of an \"advocacy newspaper\". The Wall Street Journal editor James Taranto has mockingly referred to it as the \"Puffington Host\", while Rush Limbaugh has referred to it as the \"Huffing and Puffington Post\". During the 2016 United States presidential election, HuffPost regularly appended an editor's note to the end of stories about candidate Donald Trump, reading: \"Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims\u20141.6 billion members of an entire religion\u2014from entering the U.S.\" After Trump was elected on November 8, 2016, HuffPost ended this practice to \"give respect to the office of the presidency.\""

        "content": "A French knight returning from the Crusades in the Holy Lands probably adopted the surname from \"Saint Jacques\" (or \"James the Greater\"). James the Greater was one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles, and is believed to be the first martyred apostle. Being endowed with this surname was an honor at the time and it is likely that the Church allowed it because of acts during the Crusades. Indeed, at this time, the use of biblical, Christian, or Hebrew names and surnames became very popular, and entered the European lexicon. Robert J., a Knight Crusader in 1248, was the first documented use of the surname. Since then, several personalities who have glorified this surname: Guillaume, secretary of the Duke and auditor of the account in 1413; Thomas, the Archdeacon of Penthievre, the Prior of Pirmil, the Bishop of Leon in 1478, transferred to Dol in 1482, the ambassador of the duke to the Pope in 1486, who died in 1503, and is interred in his cathedral; Jean, the Canon of Dol and Prior of Lehon; Fran\u00e7ois, Lord of the Ville-Carr\u00e9, and the Provost Marshal in 1577; and Captain of Plo\u00ebrmel, who prospered in Rennes in 1621; Bernard, a Rennes counsellor in 1653. The widespread use of surnames was not evident in Europe until the mid-to-late 16th century, and prior usage was restricted to the noble class. Spread of surname use into the UK and its spelling variations The use of surnames reached England during the conquest by an army of Norman, Breton, Flemish, and French soldiers under William the Conqueror. The names became anglicised following the conquest. Over the centuries the spelling of the Jack surname has changed and developed as the French language became increasingly associated with high culture and status. Several European kings have thus adopted the name. Jack appears in the records spelled as Jacques, Jaques, Jack, Jacks, Jackes, Jakes, Jeeks, Jeke, Jeex, Jaquiss, Jaquez and Jaquis, with spelling variations even occurring in documents referring to the same person. There are several explanations for this situation. Latin, as a language used by educated men, and the language of the Anglo-Saxons both had a profound impact on the spelling and pronunciation of Norman names. On the other hand, the Norman language affected the development of English. As the English language developed from its Germanic roots into Middle English (which was influenced by Norman French) we find a period during which spelling was not standardised but roughly followed phonetic pronunciation. During this time names were spelled a variety of ways depending upon local dialects. Thus the surname, as well as the Anglo-Saxon names, were recorded in many different ways."

        "content": "Norman surnames like Jack are sometimes mistakenly considered French, though Normans (a term derived from \"Northmen\"), were of partial Viking origin. In 911, Vikings settled in their namesake region, Normandy, in current day France, where their language merged with that of locals. Throughout this period, England also endured Viking invasions, but the Anglo-Saxons successfully repelled them until 994. When the Danes ruled England, the Saxon royal family lived in Normandy and intermarried with the Duke of Normandy's family. William II, Duke of Normandy, could then claim the English throne when his cousin, Edward the Confessor, the restored Saxon king, died without an heir. At the Battle of Hastings, William's army defeated their rival, King Harold Godwin, who was killed in the engagement. William could then claim the throne as Harold was elected and not a true member of the royal family. Despite the success of the foreign \"conquest,\" English nobles were permitted to retain their land unless they rebelled. Any resisting English elite had their lands confiscated, and some of them fled into exile as a result. William granted lands to his followers and built commanding military strongpoint castles for defence of his realm.  By 1086, more than 92% of English nobles were replaced by William's followers. One of these followers is believed to be an ancestor of the surname, Jack."

At the time of the Doomsday Book in 1086, Nether Silton was recorded as a village with a hall and the tenant-in-chief was the Count of Mortain. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of William Jagge, from Cambridgeshire dated 1251, in the \"Chartulary of Ramsey Abbey\", during the reign of King Henry III, who was known as \"The Frenchman\", 1216 \u2013 1272, a witness in the Assize Court Rolls of Cambridgeshire in 1260. Katherine Jeke of Wikington in Stafford married Robert Farnham, Lord of Querndon in 1440. The family later acquired estates at Easby Abbey and Elvington. Of this latter branch, Sir Roger Jaques was Lord Mayor of York in 1639, and knighted by King Charles I. Sir John Jacques was also knighted by King Charles I in 1628. The family branched into Middlesex. Mary, daughter of Thomas Jacques of Leeds, married Robert Gosforth of Northumberland in 1818. The present seat of the family is at Easby Abbey. Before the usage of surnames became common, differentiating between generations also led to \u2018son of Jack\u2019 becoming Jackson, most notably with President Andrew Jackson of South Carolina. The Jackson family had immigrated from Ireland during the colonial period. Jackson led American forces at the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812. Due to favorable weather conditions, and his overall leadership, Britain suffered one of her worst defeats in their overseas colonial history. His fame as a general helped him to become the seventh US president later in his life."

It was recorded in five days in June 1982 and was released in January 1983 through Spiderleg Records. The album was later re-released via Bluurg, the band's own record label. The album is influenced by the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. The most obvious sign of such an influence is the song \"Big Brother\"; Big Brother is the dictatorial political leader figure in Orwell's novel. The song revolves around how \"Big Brother is watching you\", and when Dick Lucas sings \"there's a TV in my front room and it's screwing up my head\", it is a comparison between the telescreen in the novel which monitored citizens constantly and excessive viewing of mass media. Today, there is a huge amount of video surveillance in the United Kingdom, showing the foresight of this subject matter. Like the novel, the album has dystopian overtones. It also describes a world ravaged by war, most likely our world which arguably is, this is suggested by track titles such as \"Dying World\" and \"All Gone Dead\". The latter contains lyrics like \"So long to the world, that's what they said, it's 1984 and it's all gone dead\", which can be seen as another reference to Nineteen Eighty-Four. The Day the Country Died is widely regarded as a classic punk rock album."

Feeling sick one day, George Harrison was prescribed tonic and bed rest by a doctor. With nothing to do in his room at the Palace Court Hotel, he began writing a song, recording himself on a portable tape recorder. The surviving recording includes him working on the bridge and whistling through the song's melody, likely because the song did not yet have lyrics. Besides the 1958 song \u201cIn Spite of All The Danger\u201d \u2013 co-written with McCartney, and the 1961 instrumental \"Cry for a Shadow\" \u2013 co-written as Lennon\u2013Harrison, \"Don't Bother Me\" was Harrison's first composition. Liverpool journalist Bill Harry claims that he encouraged Harrison to write a new song, and that Harrison's response of \"Don't bother me\" served as inspiration for the song's title. In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison describes the song \"as an exercise to see if I could write a song.... I was sick in bed \u2013 maybe that's why it turned out to be Don't Bother Me.\" Published by the Dick James\u2013Brian Epstein partnership, Jaep Music, this predated the five-year contract Harrison signed with Northern Songs on 9 November 1963. After \"Don't Bother Me\", it was not until 1965's Help! album that any more Harrison-penned songs (\"I Need You\" and \"You Like Me Too Much\") would appear on record. \"You Know What to Do\" was recorded in 1964, but was not released at the time."

Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes the results were deemed unsatisfactory, while Beatles writer John C. Winn writes the band ran out of time during their slated recording time. Returning to the studio the next day, the band remade the song from 7:00\u201311:30 pm, designating the first take as \"take 10\". George Martin produced, assisted by engineers Norman Smith and Richard Langham. Harrison sings lead vocal and plays the guitar solo on all tracks, complaining between takes about the difficulty this adds to performing. Lennon plays rhythm guitar, trying to achieve a \"dirty\" sound on early takes by raising the signal gain on his Rickenbacker 325 Capri. Martin was unsatisfied with the effect and suggested the use of a compressor to flatten the guitar's dynamic range and achieve the desired \"organ sound\". Lennon's amp provides a tremolo effect, resulting in a more \"sinister\" sound in the refrain and bridge, similar to the timbre heard in songs by the Shadows. Take 13 was deemed best, allowing the band to proceed with overdubbing. Harrison records another vocal, double tracking his original, while McCartney plays claves, Lennon the tambourine and Starr an Arabian bongo. Recording concludes with take 19, the overdub of take 15 onto take 13 deemed \"best\". Martin, Smith and Geoff Emerick mixed the track for mono on 30 September, then for stereo on 29 October. Another engineer assisted with stereo mixing, unidentified besides the initials \"B. T.\" The stereo mix includes the end of \"four\" from Harrison's \"one-two-three-four\" count-in."

Ian MacDonald writes reception to the song has generally been poor, with even Harrison himself subsequently discounting it. In I, Me, Mine, Harrison writes \"I don't think it's a particularly good song... It mightn't even be a song at all, but at least it showed me that all I needed to do was keep on writing, and then maybe eventually I would write something good.\" Tim Riley describes it as a weak songwriting debut and demonstrates the strength of the Beatles as a group that they \"find a groove in this tune despite its flaws.\" Mark Hertsgaard was more favourable to the song, describing it as one of the best on With the Beatles and \"a promising premiere\". Everett describes the song as an watershed moment, being the first time a guitar tone was manipulated electronically. The contrasting timbres of the guitars are unique among the songs on Please Please Me and With the Beatles, going beyond their \"typical homogeneity of sound\". He writes that \"Don't Bother Me\" and the later \"Baby's in Black\" presage the band's subsequent work, such as the feedback heard on \"It's All Too Much\". The song is heard in the Beatles 1964 film A Hard Day's Night. Along with other earlier numbers played in the film \u2013 \"She Loves You\", \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" and \"All My Loving\" \u2013 United Artists originally planned to include the song on the North American soundtrack album.

With \"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\" as the A side, the single reached the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 Pop chart, peaking at number eight, and was a number one smash on the Billboard R&B singles chart during the winter of 1962\u201363.  Cash Box described it as \"a pulsating beat-ballad romancer that the artists carve out in emotion-packed fashion\" and said \"could be a real big dual-mart, pop-r&b sales item.\"  Cash Box also praised the \"captivating instrumental assist.\" The Miracles' original version was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. It was also the group's second single to sell over a million copies, after \"Shop Around\".  The song was included on the album The Fabulous Miracles over three months after its release."

This session took place while Please Please Me was still at number one in the album charts four months after its release, and in the midst of a rigorous touring schedule that also had to include BBC sessions for radio and television. It was completed in seven takes, four of which were complete. The group then recorded four edit pieces. The final version was an edit of takes 7, 10 and 11. The Beatles also recorded \"You Really Got a Hold on Me\" on four occasions for BBC radio in 1963. One of these, from July 30, 1963 was included on the Live at the BBC collection. A live version recorded in Stockholm, Sweden, in October 1963 was released in 1995 on Anthology 1. The song was performed once again in 1969, during the Let It Be recording sessions, and featured in the 1970 documentary film, Let It Be."

The magazine is published by 4 Media EPH d.o.o. on a weekly basis. Originally devised as tabloid, it never took an openly chauvinist approach of Slobodni tjednik and always tried to give the appearance of objectivity. Gradually, its articles began to deal with shady aspects of privatisation, abuses against ethnic Serb citizens and other topics not covered by mainstream media in Croatia. As such Globus is credited for introducing investigative journalism in Croatia. The magazine covers articles on corruption, fraud, abuse of power and political assassinations. In 2009 the circulation of Globus was 28,000 copies."

        "content": "Bioconductor is a free, open source and open development software project for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data generated by wet lab experiments in molecular biology. Bioconductor is based primarily on the statistical R programming language, but does contain contributions in other programming languages. It has two releases each year that follow the semiannual releases of R. At any one time there is a release version, which corresponds to the released version of R, and a development version, which corresponds to the development version of R. Most users will find the release version appropriate for their needs. In addition there are many genome annotation packages available that are mainly, but not solely, oriented towards different types of microarrays. While computational methods continue to be developed to interpret biological data, the Bioconductor project is an open source software repository that hosts a wide range of statistical tools developed in the R programming environment. Utilizing a rich array of statistical and graphical features in R, many Bioconductor packages have been developed to meet various data analysis needs. The use of these packages provides a basic understanding of the R programming / command language. As a result, R and Bioconductor packages, which have a strong computing background, are used by most biologists who will benefit significantly from their ability to analyze datasets. All these results provide biologists with easy access to the analysis of genomic data without requiring programming expertise. The project was started in the Fall of 2001 and is overseen by the Bioconductor core team, based primarily at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, with other members coming from international institutions."

        "content": "Documentation and reproducible research. Each Bioconductor package contains at least one vignette, which is a document that provides a textual, task-oriented description of the package's functionality. These vignettes come in several forms. Many are simple \"How-to\"s that are designed to demonstrate how a particular task can be accomplished with that package's software. Others provide a more thorough overview of the package or might even discuss general issues related to the package. In the future, the Bioconductor project is looking towards providing vignettes that are not specifically tied to a package, but rather are demonstrating more complex concepts. As with all aspects of the Bioconductor project, users are encouraged to participate in this effort. Statistical and graphical methods. The Bioconductor project aims to provide access to a wide range of powerful statistical and graphical methods for the analysis of genomic data. Analysis packages are available for: pre-processing Affymetrix and Illumina, cDNA array data; identifying differentially expressed genes; graph theoretical analyses; plotting genomic data. In addition, the R package system itself provides implementations for a broad range of state-of-the-art statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and non-linear modeling, cluster analysis, prediction, resampling, survival analysis, and time series analysis. Genome annotation. The Bioconductor project provides software for associating microarray and other genomic data in real time to biological metadata from web databases such as GenBank, LocusLink and PubMed (annotate package). Functions are also provided for incorporating the results of statistical analysis in HTML reports with links to annotation WWW resources. Software tools are available for assembling and processing genomic annotation data, from databases such as GenBank, the Gene Ontology Consortium, LocusLink, UniGene, the UCSC Human Genome Project and others with the AnnotationDbi package. Data packages are distributed to provide mappings between different probe identifiers (e.g. Affy IDs, LocusLink, PubMed). Customized annotation libraries can also be assembled. Open source. The Bioconductor project has a commitment to full open source discipline, with distribution via a SourceForge.net-like platform. All contributions are expected to exist under an open source license such as Artistic 2.0, GPL2, or BSD. There are many different reasons why open-source software is beneficial to the analysis of microarray data and to computational biology in general. The reasons include:"

        "content": "La Capital is a daily Spanish-language newspaper edited and published in Rosario, province of Santa Fe, Argentina. It was founded on November 15, 1867, and it is the oldest Argentine newspaper still in circulation, which has gained it the title of Decano de la Prensa Argentina (\"Dean of the Argentine Press\"). The name was chosen by its founder, Ovidio Lagos, as a political statement on the part of those, including him, who were lobbying to move the capital of the federal government to Rosario. Rosario was in fact declared the capital three times by Congress, only to face presidential vetoes each time. At the time of its foundation, La Capital was an afternoon newspaper. Newspapers were just forums of political debate with classified ads. Since the beginning, the heading of La Capital included a motto showing a commitment to public opinion: Las columnas de La Capital pertenecen al pueblo, \"La Capital's columns belong to the people\". On 19 August 1868 the editorial building was at 104 Santa Fe St. After that, La Capital turned into a morning newspaper, and in 1870 it moved to Port St. (now Buenos Aires St.). In 1874 and again in 1887 new printing machinery was acquired. In 1889 the editorial moved to a new building at 763 Sarmiento St. and acquired a French Marinoni reaction printer. In 1903 the newspaper changed the format of its pages, abandoning the large sheet sizes. By 1905 the daily edition had 16 pages, and in 1906 it offered a full-color 28-page illustrated supplement. For 111 years, since its foundation, the newspaper employed the \"hot type\" method, that is, with Linotype typesetting machines where molten lead and antimony were used to cast each line of text. In 1978 La Capital shifted to \"cold type\", using the phototypesetting method. In mid-1998 the new publishing plant at Santiago St. near Rivadavia Ave. received its latest innovation, a Goss Urbanite rotating press which weighs 165 tonnes and measures almost 36 m in length. The new plant also features a number of other technologies. Using this, La Capital started a new edition, with a different layout and format, and fully in color. Besides national and international news, the newspaper covers local news from Rosario and its metropolitan area (Greater Rosario), plus other towns in the region and four other provinces besides Santa Fe, reaching about 2 million readers."

After a fairly difficult start in September 1972, the magazine quickly challenged L'Express. The editorial team of spring 1972 found financial backing with group Hachette and was then directed by Claude Imbert.

In 1997 the magazine was acquired by its current owner Art\u00e9mis, a French investment group founded and owned by the billionaire businessman Fran\u00e7ois Pinault. In 2001 the logo and layout of Le Point was changed. The weekly recruited journalists from the Parisian press and relied on its ability to redefine the genre. It modeled itself closely on Time Magazine and Newsweek. Le Point has a conservative, center-right stance without any political affiliation.

Timchenko told Forbes that the decision to base Meduza in Latvia was made since \"right now, establishing an independent Russian language publishing house in Latvia is possible, while in Russia it is not.\" Moreover, Timchenko stated: \"We understood that in Russia, most likely, they would not let us work\". Russian businessman and former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and telecommunications magnate Boris Zimin had been considered as passive investors, but they parted ways \"for strategic and operational reasons\". Because of financial reasons, Timchenko and her partner at Amond & Smith Ltd, Sergey Nazarkin, based Meduza in Latvia. In February 2015, the website also launched an English-language version. In January 2016, founder and CEO Galina Timchenko handed over the role of chief editor to her deputy Ivan Kolpakov. In November 2018, Kolpakov announced his resignation due to a sexual harassment scandal. He was reinstated as chief editor on March 11, 2019. In August 2018, Meduza started a partnership with the American website BuzzFeed. The partnership includes publishing each other\u2019s materials, sharing experiences, and carrying out and publishing joint investigations.

Access to the site has also been blocked from Uzbekistan. The reasons for this are unclear. Meduza has installed technical measures to circumvent censorship with their mobile apps. In June 2019, Meduza journalist Ivan Golunov was arrested by Russian police for claimed drug offences. Colleagues and friends of Golunov said they believed the charges to be fabricated, motivated by his investigations into corruption. Following a public outcry, Golunov was released, and five police officers were fired and later arrested. On April 23, 2021, the Russian Ministry of Justice designated Meduza as a 'foreign agent'. In response, the European Union rejected the decision, saying this restriction \"goes against Russia's international obligations and human rights commitments\"."

Stranded is an eloquent statement that there are still frontiers which American pop has not explored.\" Reviewing for Creem in 1974, Robert Christgau found Ferry to be an \"ambitious\" but \"oblique\" artist and quoted New York artist Sidney Tillem's 1969 thesis on figurative art, \"Aspects and Prospects\", to conclude his review of the album: \"By moral in the context of art I mean a style which executes the deeper social and psychological function of form, as opposed to a particular aspect of vanity called taste. Pop sensibility, pop consciousness, pop sentimentality have been invaluable in clarifying the provincialism and nostalgia that actually permeate a culture that has come to pride itself on sophistication. But they have not resulted in a new art simply because the requisite idealism has been lacking.\" In a positive retrospective review, AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote of the album: \"Under the direction of Bryan Ferry, Roxy moved toward[s] relatively straightforward territory, adding greater layers of piano and heavy guitars. Even without the washes of Eno's synthesizers, Roxy's music remains unsettling on occasion, yet in this new incarnation, they favor more measured material.\" Although it was the first Roxy Music album made without Brian Eno, Eno later described it as one of his personal favourite albums by the group."

        "content": "The Hackett surname originates in England. Most textbooks discussing the origin of English surnames theorize that the surname Hackett has Norman origins. The name Hacker is derived from the medieval given names Hack or Hake. These English names are derivatives of the Old Norse name Haki, which is a cognate of the English name Hook. The name Haket de Ridefort was recorded in Lincolnshire in the year 1160. The name can also be found in poll tax records in Yorkshire dating back to 1158 and the name 'Hake' is still popular in Yorkshire as well. The name was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as 'Hako'. The name 'Haket' was also recorded in 1160 in Lincolnshire and the name 'Hacke' was recorded in England in 1218. Another possible origin of the name is that it derives from the Middle English word 'haket', a kind of fish. This suggests that the name could've been an occupational name for fisherman. Mabil Hacket was recorded in the Hundred Rolls in 1273. Hackett is a common surname in the Midlands region. The village Cofton Hackett in Worcestershire is named after William de Haket, who held land there around 1166. The name is particularly common in Warwickshire ranking as the 140th most common surname in the county, as well as Staffordshire (194th), and Northamptonshire (200th). Outside of the Midlands, the name is also popular in the East of England being the 161st most common surname in Suffolk and the 250th most common surname in Cambridgeshire, as well as being popular in South East England. The name is the 149th most commons surname in East Sussex and the 208th most common name in Buckinghamshire. Many Hacketts in Ireland were English Protestants and were prominent members of society during the Protestant Ascendancy. Several Hacketts and Hakets appear in the lists of sheriffs of Counties Tipperary and Waterford and as members of parliament for Fethard up through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Notable examples include Sir Thomas Hackett who was Lord Mayor of Dublin, Thomas Hacket  an Anglican bishop who was educated at Trinity College Dublin in the 1600s, Sir John Winthrop Hackett a prominent  newspaper proprietor, politician and university chancellor and various Hacketts who were members of the Parliament of Ireland. The Hackett name first migrated to Ireland at the time of the Anglo-Norman invasion in 1170. Members of the Hackett family accompanied Richard \"Strongbow\" de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke during his invasion of Ireland. The Hacketts were subsequently granted estates in the modern counties of Kilkenny, Carlow and Kildare and thus became the principal holders of land and one of the most influential families in Ireland. As a result, several towns have taken the Hackett name, including Hacketstown, in County Carlow.  Further, the Fiants of Henry VIII and Edward VI indicate that in the sixteenth century there were also Hacketstowns, or Ballyhackett, in Counties Dublin and Kildare. A branch of the Hacketts moved into Connacht, where, in due course, they became hibernicized and, like other Norman families of that province, formed a distinct if small sept which was known as MacHackett, their seat being Castle Hackett, six miles south-east of Tuam. Yet, in modern times, there has been little trace of the name Hackett in Connacht or usage of the name MacHackett in general. The Hackett name is still strong, however, in and around Counties Tipperary and Kilkenny."

An early Coat of Arms was worn by William de Hackett of Cashel in County Tipperary who founded a Franciscan Friary there in the 13th Century. His arms were three hake fish haurient in fesse and in chief three trefoils slipped proper, however the coloring is unknown. Another Coat of Arms was granted to Sir Thomas Hackett, descended from an ancient family long settled in Ireland and Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1688. The coat of arms bore \"the splendid blazon of a field gules thereon three hakes argent haurient in fesse, on a chief or three trefoils slipped proper. The crest being, out of a mural coronet argent, an eagle displayed with two heads sable, with the motto; Spec mea Deus\". Translated, this reads \"On a red shield are three silver hake fish (a pun on the name Hackett) on the top fourth (Chief) are three shamrocks on a gold background. A double eagle wearing a tiara perched on two snakes, while a motto reads \"God is my Hope\". Other mottos include \"Virtue and Fidelity.\", \"All for now, men!\" and \"Fortitudine et prudentia\" (With fortitude and prudence) the later believed to be from Hackett's originating in the Carlow, Kilkenny, and Wexford areas. Most of the official coats of arms granted to individual Hacketts are a variant of the one granted to Sir Thomas Hackett."

The project was revised in 1872 as an opera-ballet in four acts, with a libretto by .

The plot of Mlada was adapted, with a new time and place, from a ballet by Filippo Taglioni entitled The Shadow (, , Tye\u00f1 ), which premiered in 1839 in Saint Petersburg. Serov died, however, in 1871 before composing anything for the work. Gedeonov revised his conception as an opera-ballet, with a libretto by Viktor Kr\u00eflov, and in 1872 proposed through Vladimir Stasov a collaborative effort by four members of The Mighty Handful\u2014C\u00e9sar Cui, Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, Modest Mussorgsky and Aleksandr Borodin\u2014who were to write music for the sung portions of the libretto and dramatic action. Ludwig Minkus, at that time the Bolshoy Kamenniy Theatre's First Imperial Ballet Composer, was to write ballet music to be inserted at various points. Rimsky-Korsakov provides the following details concerning the work's genesis in his memoirs, Chronicle of My Musical Life, 1909: \"Gedeonov, Director of the Imperial Theatres at the time, had conceived the idea of producing a work which should combine ballet, opera and spectacle. For this purpose he had written the program of a stage performance in four acts on a subject borrowed from the Elbe slavs and had commissioned V. A. Kr\u00eflov to work up the text. Mlada, with its mixture of fantasy and everyday reality, was a most grateful subject for musical treatment. Gedeonov asked Cui, Borodin, Mussorgsky, and myself to compose music for it; moreover, Minkus, the official ballet composer of the Imperial Theatres, was to compose the incidental ballet music. Who the initiator of this order was, I do not know. I suspect here the influence of Lukashevich, an official of the Board of Directors of the Theatres, who had begun to gain power under Gedeonov... I also believe that the connection had not happened without V. V. Stasov's having something to do with it. The four of us were invited to Gedeonov's for a joint deliberation on the work. Act\u00a01, as the most dramatic, was entrusted to the most dramatic composer\u2014Cui; Act\u00a04, a mixture of the dramatic and poetic, to Borodin; Acts\u00a02 and 3 were distributed between Mussorgsky and myself. Some portions of Act\u00a02 (folk-wise choruses) were assigned to me; the first half of Act\u00a03 (flight of shadows and appearance of Mlada) was reserved for me; while Mussorgsky undertook the second half\u2014appearance of Chernobog, for which he wanted to utilize his Night on Bald Mountain, heretofore unused. The thought of Mlada and the few sketches I made for it took me away from The Maid of Pskov and the work on The Stone Guest. Cui composed the whole first act of Mlada rather rapidly. Borodin, who had been somewhat disappointed in writing Prince Igor, now took much of the suitable material from it, composed some new music also, and thus wrote almost the whole draft of Act 4. Mussorgsky composed the 'March of the Princes' on a Russian theme (subsequently published separately, with the 'Trio alla Turca'), as well as some other portions of Act 2; he also made suitable changes in his Night on the Bare Mountain and adapted it for Chernobog's appearance in Act\u00a03 of Mlada. On the other hand, my notes of the chorus in Act\u00a02 and the flight of shadows in Act\u00a03 were still uncompleted and nothing would come of them, owing to a certain haziness and indefiniteness in the task of writing music to a scenario insufficiently worked out. Gedeonov's scheme was not destined to be realized. Soon he left the post of Director of the Imperial Theatres and vanished from sight. The Mlada affair dropped into oblivion, and all of us turned to the work we had left for it; whatever we had composed for Mlada found its way into other compositions later.\" \u00ab\u0422\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0413\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u0441\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0442, \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0438 \u0444\u0435\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044e. \u0421 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044e \u043e\u043d \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0443 \u0441\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 4-\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f\u0445, \u0437\u0430\u0438\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0432 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0437 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0431\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d, \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0443 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0412. \u0410. \u041a\u0440\u044b\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443. \u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u00ab\u041c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u044b\u00bb \u0441 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0435. \u0421\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0413\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c \u041a\u044e\u0438, \u0411\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0443, \u041c\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0438 \u043c\u043d\u0435;

        "content": "Mussorgsky contributed four numbers\u2014two borrowed from previous works and two newly composed for Mlada. All of them would be recycled in subsequent projects: The 'Market Scene' (, Stsena torga) in Act 2 was later adapted as the 'Fair Scene' in the opera Sorochints\u00ef Fair (1880). The 'Fistfight' (, Kulachn\u00efy boy) in Act 2 was borrowed from the 'Scene in the Temple: Chorus of the People' from Oedipus in Athens (1860), Mussorgsky's earliest stage work. The composer had attempted to recycle this piece in Salammb\u00f4 (1866), and planned to do so again in Sorochints\u00ef Fair, thus making it, in four attempts, his most adapted composition. The 'March of the Princes and Priests' (, Marsh knyazey i zhretsov) in Act 2 was later adapted as The Capture of Kars (1880), an occasional piece for orchestra. The main theme of this march was taken from song no. 6 (, A kak po lugu, lugu) in Miliy Balakirev's Anthology of Russian Folk Songs (1866). This theme was later used by Tchaikovsky as the opening theme of the 4th movement of his Serenade for Strings, Op. 48 (1880). Mussorgsky's march corresponds to Rimsky-Korsakov's dazzling 'Procession of the Princes' (popularly known as the 'Procession of the Nobles') in his later setting of Mlada. The 'Glorification of Chornobog' (, Slavlenye Chornoboga) in Act 3 was borrowed from the tone poem St. John's Night on the Bare Mountain (1867), and was later adapted as the 'Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad' in Sorochints\u00ef Fair (1880). Among other changes, this revision saw the addition of vocal soloists and chorus to what had previously been a purely orchestral score. The manuscript score of the 'Glorification of Chornobog' is either no longer extant or was reused (with the necessary alternations made) as that of the 'Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad'."

Tracy lives with her mother (Noni Hazlehurst) and brother Ray in the suburb of Cabramatta, Sydney, where heroin is readily available. She is in need of money to become a partner in the video store that she works in, but her loan applications are repeatedly rejected by finance providers, as a result of her past criminal record, poor repayments of credit card debt, history of drug use and lack of collateral. Tracy lies to both her mother and her boss at the video store, pretending she has received the loan. The casual ways people lie to each other for convenience is one of the recurring themes of the movie. Tracy is trying to help her drug addicted stepfather and former National Rugby League star Lionel Dawson (Hugo Weaving) to kick his heroin addiction. After a four-year absence in Vancouver, her former boyfriend Jonny Nguyen (Dustin Nguyen), also a former heroin addict, has come back into her life. Jonny, who now dresses in business suits, claims to have employment as a stockbroker at a large firm and suggests he may be able to obtain the money Tracy desires through share trading. The romance between Tracy and Jonny is rekindled. Upon visiting Jonny's alleged workplace, Tracy discovers Jonny has lied to her and is not in fact employed as a stockbroker. Jonny has become involved in a drug deal with her brother Ray, and Tracy also chooses to become involved in the deal as she sees this as the only means of providing the finance she needs to become a partner in the video store. Tracy, Ray, and Jonny set out to execute the deal, which ends in tragedy. Tracy's courage and deep love for those she cares about are notable in the climactic scenes of the film."

The clan name originated in the 10th century as a derivative of its founder Gallchobhair mac Rorcan. They descend in the paternal line from the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill's Cen\u00e9l Conaill. The immediate progenitors of the Gallaghers held the High Kingship of Ireland during the 6th and 7th centuries in the form of Ainmuire mac S\u00e9tnai, \u00c1ed mac Ainmuirech, M\u00e1el Coba mac \u00c1edo and Cellach mac M\u00e1ele Coba; \u00c1ed was also an ancestor of the O'Donnell and O'Doherty clans.

        "content": "In Ireland, the anglicised version of the name \"Gallagher\" is pronounced \"Goll-a-her\" in parts of its native County Donegal in Ulster, while elsewhere in the country it is most frequently pronounced as \"Gall-a-her\". Outside Ireland, there has been a corruption or alteration of the pronunciation, resulting in \"Gall-ag-er\" in some parts of Britain and the USA. The name Gallagher is an anglicisation of the Irish surname \u00d3 Gallchobhair, \u00d3 Gallchobhoir (or two newer spelling forms, \u00d3 Gallch\u00f3ir and \u00d3 Gallach\u00f3ir), these being masculine forms; the corresponding feminine forms are N\u00ed Ghallchobhair (newer forms N\u00ed Ghallch\u00f3ir and N\u00ed Ghallach\u00f3ir). Apart from the aforementioned spelling there are at least 30 recorded variants including Gallacher, Gallager, Gallaher, Gallocher, Galliher, Gallaugher, Galagher, Galegher, Goligher, Golliher, Gollaher and Gallahue. The earliest recorded incidence of the name is in a fragment of a manuscript presently in the Royal Library of Brussels, which states the name \"Gallchubhair\". A similarly earlier mention occurs in the Annals of the Four Masters, where it is recorded that Mael Cobo \u00dai Gallchobhar, abbot of Scrin Adamnain, died in 1022 AD. Gallchobhar was the one given the role of founding father of the clan at the advent of widespread surname usage in Ireland, which began around the 10th century. As with the modern Irish surname \u00d3 Conch\u00fair, frequently anglicised as O'Conor, \u00d3 Gallch\u00f3ir similarly appears to be a conjoined/compound word and shares in common with O'Connor, the same suffix. With O'Conner likewise starting out in the original Irish as Conchobhar/Conchubhar (Con-chobhar meaning \"lover of canines\"). The original Irish spelling, \u00d3 Gallchobhar, draws from this same compound naming convention. It is the most common surname in County Donegal (D\u00fan na nGall means \"fort of the foreigner\"), and thus is very common in Derry, and is the fourteenth-most-common by birth records in Ireland. In the United States, it was ranked by the 2000 US Census as the 433rd-most-common name out of over 68,000 surnames found. According to Professor Edward MacLysaght, in the mid-20th century Gallagher was one of the most common Irish surnames, most of the recorded births being located in the northern province, Ulster, and the western province, Connacht, with the majority being recorded in the homeland of the sept\u2014County Donegal in Ulster. In 1890 it was ranked the 12th-most-common surname in Ireland, while in 1996 it was 20th."

        "content": "|Further Cen\u00e9l Conaill. The Gallchobhar clan hails from the Irish baronies of T\u00edr Aodha/T\u00edr Hugh (\"land of Hugh\") and Raphoe, in the east of County Donegal, Ireland, in which Ballybeit and Ballynaglack served as seats of their power. They are members of Cen\u00e9l Aedha (\"descendants of Hugh/\u00c1ed (mac Ainmuireach)\") and of the larger Cen\u00e9l Conaill. One modern and therefore apocryphal origin story is that the original person, being a courageous and charitable person, went to the assistance of the crew of the first Viking ship to arrive off the Irish coast and whose ship was wrecked off the coast of County Donegal, where he was the local chieftain. He having first saved them and then cared for them, they eventually returned to their homeland, only to return soon after with the first raiding party. Hence it is argued he was given the name (\"Gall\" means stranger or foreigner in modern Irish and the ending \"cubhair\" and \"cobhair\" which for the purpose of this story is said to be derived from \"cabhair\" in modern Irish meaning help or helper). Whatever the derivation of his name (see reference to O' Clery's Glossary above giving the derivation as Gal+acobhar 'ambition of valour'), Gallchobhar was the one given the role of founding father of the clan at the advent of surname use in Ireland in around the 10th century. The earliest recorded incidence of the name in a fragment of a manuscript presently in the Royal Library of Brussels is \"Gallchubhair\". A similarly earlier mention occurs in the Annals of the Four Masters, where it is recorded that Mael Cobo \u00dai Gallchobhar, abbot of Scrin Adamnain, died in 1022 AD. The family's origins are with the chieftain Aodh, a name corresponding to the English Hugh (whence Tirhugh), a lineal descendant of Conall Gulban son of 5th-century high king and warlord Niall No\u00edg\u00edallach, known in English as Niall of the Nine Hostages, who is reputed to have brought St Patrick to Ireland as a slave. Aodh established his d\u00fanarus fort building or residence at a place corresponding to the present-day townland of Glassbolie in Tirhugh. The chieftains of his line ruled in relative peace for several generations until the beginning of the Viking invasion of Ireland in the 9th century. The ruling chieftain of the time, whose real name is not recorded, was almost certainly obliged to come to some accommodation with the foreign invader resulting in the nickname \"Gallc\u00f3bhair\" which has been applied to his descendants thereafter. It would appear that the previously obscure Cen\u00e9l Lugdach forged multiple matrimonial alliances with the local Viking leadership, and not the Gallchobair of the Cen\u00e9l Aedha who existed before the arrival of the Vikings in the 800s, the Cen\u00e9l Lugdach are descended from Lugaid mac S\u00e9tnai, one of the great-grandsons of Conall Gulban. In contrast to the Gallchobair who are descended from his brother and the first born son Ainmuire mac S\u00e9tnai. The Cen\u00e9l Lugdach tribal territory extended from Dobhar (Gweedore) to the river Suilidhe (Swilly) in Donegal. From this clan descend the Cen\u00e9l Conaill surnames of O'Doherty, and O'Donnell. The modern surname system began c. 900, but wasn't adopted in its entirety until about 1100. Despite the legend that Brian Boru was somehow responsible for the widespread implementation of this naming system, the custom may have developed of its own accord as the Irish population grew in size. The \u00d3 Gallchobhair sept claims to be the most senior family of the Cen\u00e9l Conaill as Gallchobar was descended from Conall Gulban. The sept's territory was spread across the areas within the modern baronies of Raphoe and Tirhugh in Co Donegal. From the 14th century until the 16th century, the sept's chiefs were marshals of the O'Donnell cavalry in the O'Donnell Lucht Tighe. The principal branch of the family was centred at Ballybeit and Ballynaglack. Although generally aligned with the O'Donnells during the period, a renegade band of Gallaghers helped their rival, Shane O'Neill, escape after the Battle of Fearsaid Suili in 1567."

        "content": "In the 16th century, the \u00d3 Gallchobairs also opposed the \u00d3 Donnells for a short time for religious reasons after King Henry VIII of England declared himself King of Ireland and head of the church in the Tudor conquest of Ireland beginning in 1541. To maintain their lands and power, the \u00d3 Donnell Lord of T\u00edr Conaill, was forced to recognise Henry VIII as King of Ireland, leader of the Irish Church and had to defend the new English religion from anyone who would advocate papal authority. As a result, the \u00d3 Donnells supported Bishop O'Kane over Edmond O'Gallagher. O'Gallagher was never accepted as bishop, and he died mysteriously in 1543. The O'Gallagher clan then seized the \u00d3 Donnell Lifford Castle in retaliation, for about a year. With the death of Edmond, the Pope appointed another Gallagher as Bishop of Raphoe in his place, although this bishop was not capable of assuming this position until the arrival of the English queen Mary, who restored Roman Catholicism as the state religion in 1553. It appears that, with the death of the subservient \u00d3 Donnell lord, the practice of Catholicism was left to continue peacefully in T\u00edr Conaill, at least up to the end of the Nine Years' War (c. 1594) and the British Plantation of Ulster (1606). Redmond O'Gallagher was appointed Bishop of Killala by Pope Paul III in 1545 and presumably was recognised by the Crown in the reign of Queen Mary I, but there is no record of his recognition by Queen Elizabeth I. In 1569, Redmond O'Gallagher was appointed Bishop of Derry. He died in office on 15 March 1601. Donat O'Gallagher, OFM succeeded Redmond as Bishop of Killala in 1570. In 1580, Donat was appointed Bishop of Down and Connor and died in office in 1581."

        "content": "Captain Gallagher (died 1818) was an Irish highwayman who, as one of the later Irish rapparees (guerrillas), led a bandit group in the hills of the Irish countryside, armed with the Blunderbuss of the day, during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Born in Bonniconlon, County Mayo, he lived with his aunt in Derryronane, Swinford, for much of his early life and was raised near the woods of Barnalyra (roughly the location of modern-day Ireland West Airport Knock). As he reached early adulthood, he and a group of others began raiding mail coaches as well as wealthy landowners and travellers throughout eastern Mayo and parts of southern County Sligo and western County Roscommon. His attacks on landowners were especially widely known and, in one reported incident, Gallagher and his men raided the home of an extremely unpopular landlord in Killasser and forced him to eat half a dozen eviction notices he had recently drawn up for nearly half a dozen tenant farmers before escaping with silver and other valuables. Although successfully evading British patrols for some time, he was finally apprehended by authorities in the parish of Coolcarney (or possibly Attymass) near the foothills of the Ox Mountains while recovering from an illness at a friend's home during Christmas. He had been informed on by a neighbour whom Gallagher had formerly helped after sending a message of Gallagher's whereabouts to the British commanding officer at Foxford. Immediately sending for reinforcements from Ballina, Castlebar and Swinford, a force of 200 redcoats were sent after Gallagher and, upon their arrival, proceeded to surround the home where the highwayman had been staying. Gallagher, by then in poor health and not wishing to endanger his host or his family, surrendered to the British. Taken back to Foxford, he was tried and convicted before being taken to Castlebar, where he was executed. Shortly before his execution, he had claimed to the British commanding officer that his treasure had been hidden under a rock in the woods of Barnalyra. After Gallagher's execution, the officer quickly led several cavalryman to Barnalyra who discovered there were thousands of rocks in the wood, upon a long search of all the rocks within the area, they reportedly only recovered a jewel hilted sword. It has been speculated that Gallagher may have been hoping to lead them to the site in the hopes his men would be able to rescue him from their hideout near the Derryronane-Curryane border although the treasure was never recovered."

However, the paper was censored and suppressed in 1916 after Frank, as its republican editor, accused the British authorities of lying about the conditions and situation of republican prisoners in Frongoch internment camp. In December 1931, Gallagher now at The Irish Press, was prosecuted by the Irish Free State military tribunal for publishing Seditious libel, articles alleging that Garda\u00ed had mistreated the opponents (Anti-Treaty republicans) of the Irish Free State government. This was facilitated by Amendment No. 17 of Constitution of the Irish Free State and Gallagher was convicted and fined \u00a350. Frank is most well known for penning Four Glorious Years 1918\u20131921 and becoming the deputy director of the first D\u00e1il's Department of Publicity in March 1921, assisting his colleague Erskine Childers, and together they published the Irish Bulletin. In 1965 his book The Anglo-Irish Treaty was published posthumously. In 1974 The indivisible island: the history of the partition of Ireland was to be his last published, again posthumously."

The song was used in the American animated sitcom The Simpsons. In a 2006 episode titled \"G.I.

The English form of the same name is Nicholas. Nicola was a frequently given male personal name among the traditional Italian nobility, and was used often in the Middle Ages. In the UK and Germany, the male form Nicola has been used as a female name, which originally came from incorrectly presuming the name's vowel ending \"a\" was the female form, as has also occurred with the male given name Andrea. The female form of Nicola in Italian is Nicoletta. Less commonly, the name is spelled \"Nichola\" or \"Nickola\". Other forms of the female name in other languages include Nicole or Nicolette in French, Nikolett or Nikoletta in Hungarian, \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1 or \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 in Greek.

        "content": "After nearly a decade of Clapton's guitar playing taking a backseat to his singing/songwriting, this album contains several guitar solos. The album includes synthesizers and drum machines played by Phil Collins, Ted Templeman, Peter Robinson, Michael Omartian, James Newton Howard, Chris Stainton and Greg Phillinganes, as well as Clapton's Roland guitar synthesizer on the 9th track, \"Never Make You Cry\". Bassists Donald \"Duck\" Dunn from Booker T. & the MG's and Nathan East (later of the smooth jazz quartet Fourplay) also played on the sessions. In his autobiography, Clapton remembers the 1984 session pleasantly: \"The whole thing is going so great, I hope it never stops.\" However, his troubled marriage with Pattie Boyd became the subject matter for most of his original material: \"She's Waiting\", \"Same Old Blues\" and \"Just Like a Prisoner\" all contain extended guitar solos from Clapton. It was during this period that Pattie Boyd left him and \"it was eventually decided that we should have a trial separation\". Clapton assuaged his pain by writing the song \"Behind the Sun\", featuring only his guitar and vocals along with Phil Collins' synthesizer, as the final song on the album. This was Clapton's first collaboration with songwriter Jerry Lynn Williams. Warner Brothers looked critically at this follow-up to the Money and Cigarettes album, Clapton's first for the label, which did not sell well. The Phil Collins-produced Behind the Sun first submitted in the fall of 1984 was rejected by the label, insisting that he record several new songs written by Jerry Williams, backed by Los Angeles session players. The label put the project under the auspices of veteran company producers Lenny Waronker and Ted Templeman. Warner Brothers then emphasised the new tracks, releasing two of them, \"Forever Man\" (which reached the Top 40) and \"See What Love Can Do,\" as singles. The resulting album was somewhat disjointed, though the record company may have been correct in thinking that the album as a whole was competent without being very exciting in response to the original line-up of songs for the album because they wanted the album to have more hit single material. Clapton agreed to their terms, but asked them to provide some \"hits\" and record the songs with their own producer and musicians: \"They sent me three songs by a Texas songwriter \u2013 \"Forever Man\", \"Something's Happening\" and \"See What Love Can Do\" \u2013 and they were good.\" The sessions featured Toto guitarist Steve Lukather and  then-drummer Jeff Porcaro, as well as Clapton's long-time collaborators, drummer Jamie Oldaker, bassist Nathan East and keyboardist Greg Phillinganes."

Robert Christgau in his Village Voice Consumer Guide described the album as \"[s]ad [a]nd also bad\" because Clapton was simply following commercial market fashion. In a retrospective summary for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann feels that the album is \"somewhat schizophrenic\" due to the tinkering of the record label, who were concerned that the original version of the album contained no hits and was too downbeat, so brought in new writers and producers. Ruhlman concludes that despite some effective guitar work the album is competent rather than exciting, and is not among Clapton's best."

Raffi's version of the song replaces the various foods with ones that would be more familiar to an American audience: spaghetti for Aikendrum's hair, meatballs for his eyes, cheese for his nose, and pizza for his mouth. This version was also the Barney & Friends version. A version of the song is included on the Folkways album A Folk Concert in Town Hall, New York, recorded on January 1, 1959 and featuring Oscar Brand, Jean Ritchie and David Sear.

In 2008, the paper hosted the national conference of the Association de la presse francophone du Canada. In 2009, the paper expanded its web presence to publish daily news updates.

In 2011, the paper was purchased from its prior owners, Carole Dub\u00e9 and R\u00e9jean Grenier, by Le5 Communications, the owner of the city's francophone radio station CHYC-FM. The transaction also made it a sister publication to L'Express de Timmins, which was launched by Le5 in 2010.

It is seen as a transitional album in their history and marked a further musical move away from American influences towards more traditional English folk songs that had begun on their previous album, What We Did on Our Holidays and reached its peak on the follow-up, Liege & Lief, released later the same year. As well as featuring several, at the time, unreleased Bob Dylan songs, the album also marked Sandy Denny's arrival as a songwriter, with \"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\", a song covered by many other performers and now regarded as a classic. The only traditional song on the album, \"A Sailor's Life\", is seen as pivotal in the development of English folk rock music. Changes in the line-up of the band, due not only to its musical direction but also to external events, mark this album as a turning point in the band's history. 1969 was a prolific year for Fairport Convention; from What We Did on Our Holidays to Liege & Lief within twelve months represented a major development. The album also gave the band their first UK chart success, reaching number 12 in the UK album chart (the second highest position in the band's entire career), while the single release, \"Si Tu Dois Partir\", achieved number 21 in the UK singles chart."

        "content": "Fairport Convention had been invited to Bob Dylan's London music publishers to hear then-unreleased tracks from The Basement Tapes sessions. The band's bassist, Ashley Hutchings, said \"We loved it all. We would have covered all the songs if we could.\" In the event, versions of \"Percy's Song\", \"Million Dollar Bash\" and \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\" (retitled \"Si Tu Dois Partir\") were used on the album. The French lyrics for the latter were created during the interval of a performance at the Middle Earth Club. According to guitarist Simon Nicol: \"I think the boredom factor was one of the reasons we came up with this wacky idea. Three or four punters joined us in the dressing room; they were either French visitors or students of French working in London, and happened to be there that night.\" \"Percy's Song\" and \"Million Dollar Bash\" had never been released before. The band's male vocalist Iain Matthews left during the recordings for Unhalfbricking to make his own album Matthews' Southern Comfort, after recording just one track, \"Percy's Song\". Sandy Denny sang lead vocals on all the other songs, including her own compositions, \"Autopsy\", and \"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\". The latter was covered by many artists and is now viewed to be a classic. The lengthy \"A Sailor's Life\", a traditional English folk song collected by A. L. Lloyd, was already part of Denny's club repertoire. In particular, the version on Unhalfbricking has been described as \"the turning point of Fairport's history from earlier contemporary Americana to English songs\" and by AllMusic's Richie Unterberger as a \"clear signpost to the future\". Guitarist Richard Thompson contributed two compositions to the album. The opening track, \"Genesis Hall\", is a slow 3/4 waltz, on which Simon Nicol played dulcimer, while Sandy Denny provided the vocals; it was the B-Side of the single release. Genesis Hall was the nickname of the former Bell Hotel in Drury Lane, which had become a squat in early 1969 and later became noted for a mass eviction by the police. In the view of Mojo magazine reviewer Mike Baines, \"Thompson's writing reached maturity on 'Genesis Hall'\". \"Cajun Woman\", which opens the second side of the album, features Dave Swarbrick's fiddle-playing in his first work with Fairport; having no electric pick-ups, the band improvised by smashing open a telephone and attaching the microphone to the instrument with an elastic band."

Its object was to \"avoid completing a real word\", and \"Unhalfbricking\" was Sandy Denny's creation. Eric Hayes took the photo on the sleeve design for the UK release, which featured neither album title nor band name. The photo captured Denny's parents, Neil and Edna Denny, standing outside the family home at 9B Arthur Road, Wimbledon, south London, with the band distantly visible through the garden fence. St Mary's Church, Wimbledon, can be seen in the background. Joe Boyd later said \"Unhalfbricking, then, that cover shot was taken in the early spring, right before the crash, I think; and that record came out in June\". Unhalfbricking'''s cover in the US, released by A&M Records, was even less informative. It consisted of a picture of circus elephants with a small inset image of the band, allegedly because \"the group apparently so upset their American label that they replaced it with an image of trampolining elephants\"."

Simon Nicol later said:  Ashley Hutchings also said in relation to the album cover photograph: Unhalfbricking appeared, therefore, at a difficult time for the group, but was enthusiastically received. After a period of intense reflection about their future they decided to pursue the folk rock idea further and violinist Dave Swarbrick was invited to join full-time for the follow-up, Liege & Lief."

He was less complimentary about \"A Sailor's Life\", regarding it as overlong. The album also gave the band their first UK chart success, spending a total of eight weeks in the UK album chart and reaching number 12. The single \"Si Tu Dois Partir\" spent nine weeks on the UK singles chart and reached number 21. Fairport Convention appeared on Top of the Pops on 14 August 1969, miming to the song and augmented by a roadie, Steve Sparks on percussion. It was voted number 688 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). In 2004 Q magazine placed Unhalfbricking at number 41 in its list of the 50 Greatest British Albums Ever, and in the same year The Observer, describing it as \"a thoroughly English masterpiece\", listed it at number 27 in its Top 100 British Albums. The following year, 2005, it was included in Robert Dimery's  \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". The Sandy Denny track \"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\" was voted \"Favourite Folk Track of All Time\" by listeners in the Radio 2 Folk Awards 2007. In 2010 Unhalfbricking was voted the second best Fairport Convention album after Liege & Lief by Mojo magazine readers."

        "content": "The boss of a black market ring (known only as \"The Chief\") wants to smuggle a batch of jewelry from a foreign state into the Soviet Union by hiding it inside the orthopedic cast of a courier. The Chief sends a minor henchman named Gennadiy 'Gesha' Kozodoyev (played by Mironov) to serve as the courier. Kozodoyev travels to Turkey via a tourist cruise ship. The local co-conspirators do not know what the courier looks like; they only know that he is supposed to say a code word to identify himself. Due to a mix-up, they mistake Kozodoyev's fellow passenger from the cruise ship, the \"ordinary Soviet citizen\" Semyon Gorbunkov (played by Nikulin) for the courier. They place a cast around his arm and put the contraband jewels inside the cast. Upon the cruise ship's return to the Soviet Union, Gorbunkov lets the police know what happened, and the police captain, who is working undercover as a taxi driver, uses Gorbunkov as bait to catch the criminals. Gesha and Lyolik (another of Chief's henchmen, played by Papanov) attempt to lure Gorbunkov into situations where they can quietly, without a wetwork, remove the cast and reclaim the contraband jewels. On one such occasion, Gesha invites Gorbunkov to a fancy restaurant with the intention of getting Gorbunkov drunk enough for Lyolik to subdue him. However, both Gesha and Gorbunkov become drunk and Gorbunkov is taken home by the police after he and Gesha cause a scene. Gorbunkov's wife begins to suspect either that he has been recruited by foreign intelligence after finding a large amount of money and a gun loaded with blanks in Gorbunkov's possession (previously given to him by the police), or that he is having an affair. Gorbunkov explains that he is working with the Soviet police on a secret mission, but cannot divulge any details. The Chief sends Anna Sergeyevna, a female operative, to help retrieve the cast. Sergeyevna invites Gorbunkov to her hotel room under the pretense of wanting to sell Gorbunkov a gown and spikes his drink with a sleeping pill. As Gorbunkov is about to pass out, his building's nosy superintendent who had followed Gorbunkov brings his wife into the hotel room before either Lyolik or the police can get to him. Gorbunkov awakens the next morning to find that his wife has assumed that his story was all a cover up for an affair, and has left with the children. The police in the meantime have deduced that Gesha is involved with the smuggling scheme surrounding the cast, and ask Gorbunkov to mention to Gesha that he is planning to travel to another city and will have his cast removed there. Gesha reports this to the Chief, who sends Lyolik disguised as a taxi driver to pick up Gorbunkov. Gorbunkov assumes that Lyolik is also an undercover policeman, and gives away the fact that he has been in contact with the police the entire time. Lyolik plays along and tells Gorbunkov that he has been authorized to remove the cast a day early at a safehouse along the way to Dubrovka. As Lyolik is about to remove the cast, Gorbunkov deduces that Lyolik is actually a criminal and attempts to escape. Lyolik and Gesha chase Gorbunkov and with the help of the Chief himself, they capture Gorbunkov. Upon removing Gorbunkov's cast, they realize that the police had removed the diamonds in the cast a long time ago. The criminals kidnap Gorbunkov and attempt to flee as the police track them down in a helicopter and capture them. Gorbunkov is reunited with his family, with the police having explained the situation to his wife. Gorbunkov goes on vacation with his family, albeit now with a broken leg as a result of the kidnapping."

The title is a combined pun of his family name, Sumner, and a character in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, the summoner. Released in 1993, it explores themes of love and morality in a noticeably upbeat mood compared to his previous release, the introspective The Soul Cages released in 1991 after the loss of both his parents in the 1980s. This album contains two US hits; \"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\" reached No.\u00a017 on the Billboard Hot 100 while \"Fields of Gold\" got to No.\u00a023. Ten Summoner's Tales was shortlisted for the 1993 Mercury Prize. In 1994, it was nominated for six Grammy awards including Album of the Year (losing to Whitney Houston\u2018s The Bodyguard), winning Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance (\"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\") and Best Long Form Music Video, while \"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\" was also nominated for Record and Song of the Year. A laser disc and VHS of the album were released, containing live performances of all songs on the album at Lake House. A promotional disc was made where Sting discusses some of the songs on the album. There was also an unofficial live album produced during the Ten Summoner's Tales era, entitled Meadowlands of Gold, which contained 13 tracks performed at the Meadowlands Arena on February 26, 1994 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The songs consisted of tracks from the album, and a few songs by The Police plus a cover of the Beatles' \"A Day in the Life\"."

The cover of the album was photographed at Wardour Old Castle in Wiltshire, featuring Hr\u00edmnir, an Icelandic horse Sting owned for a period. A long form 'performance' video of the entire album was filmed at Sting's Lake House property. The audio used is partly from the album, but partly recorded as played by the band during the filming. This film was released in conjunction with the album. The video went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Video in 1994, and was directed by Doug Nichol and produced by Julie Fong. On 11 August 1994, a compact disc of Ten Summoner's Tales became the first item ever securely purchased over the Internet, for $12.48 plus shipping. There was also an interview disc released for the album, in which Sting talks about all tracks on the album. The second track on the album, \"Love Is Stronger Than Justice (The Munificent Seven)\", was named as a homage to the films Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven. According to the interview disc, the idea came to Sting when he wanted to write a song in the 7/4 time signature. The song \"Seven Days\" is also noted for the sophisticated playing of drummer Vinnie Colaiuta in the 5/4 time signature. The international-exclusive track \"Everybody Laughed But You\" was excluded from Canadian and American pressings of the album. However, US singles from the album included the song, as well as a version of the song with different lyrics titled \"January Stars\". The singles for Ten Summoner's Tales also give credit to Fernandes Guitars, as Dominic Miller played a Fernandes P-Project Acoustic Electric Nylon guitar throughout the album."

        "content": "Dion's real international breakthrough came when she paired up with Peabo Bryson to record the title track to Walt Disney Pictures animated film Beauty and the Beast (1991). The song captured a musical style that Dion would utilize in the future: sweeping, classical and soft rock influenced ballads with soft instrumentation. Both a critical and commercial smash, the song became her second United States top 10 hit, and also won many awards. That song was also the first single from Celine Dion album which had a soft rock influence that was combined with elements of soul and classical music. Due to the success of the lead-off single, the album was as well received. As with Dion's earlier releases, the album had an overtone of love. Dion worked with a new team of writers and producers on her eponymous album. Five songs were written by Diane Warren. \"With This Tear\" was a gift from Prince who wrote the song especially for Dion. The tracks were produced mainly by Walter Afanasieff, Ric Wake and Guy Roche. By 1992, Unison, Celine Dion and media appearances had propelled Dion to superstardom in the North America. She had achieved one of her main objectives: wedging her way into the anglophone market and establishing fame. Apart from her rising success, there were also changes in Dion's personal life, as Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil would make the transition from manager to lover. However, the relationship was kept a secret as both feared that the public would find the twenty-six-year difference between their ages incongruous. The European version of Celine Dion included \"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\" as a bonus track. The album was re-released on 7 September 1992 in Australia with a bonus disc containing four songs which had been previously released as singles from Unison. \"Send Me a Lover\" was a \"leftover\" from the recording sessions of the Celine Dion album and it was released in 1994 on the charity compilation Kumbaya Album 1994."

Music critic Robert Christgau called it the \"worst album of the year\u2014that I can remember\". Jan DeKnock of Chicago Tribune said that the album \"is even better, because the young singer-only 24-has developed enough confidence in her second language to really deliver the emotional nuances of a lyric, especially in the ballads that dominate this album.

The present editor is Caeser Bagchi . Anandamela is one of the oldest surviving Bengali children's magazines and is published twice a month, on the fifth (previously second) and twentieth days. Many authors started writing for children through Anandamela; for example, author Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay was noticed as a children's author after writing Manojder Adbhut Baari, which was published in Anandamela as a serial novel. On 19 June 2004, Anandamela split up into two different magazines, the original Anandamela (for children age 8\u00a0\u2013 14), and Unish Kuri, (for teens and young adults age 15\u00a0\u2013 25)."

        "content": "Yellow Submarine is the tenth  studio album by English rock band the Beatles, released on 13 January 1969 in the United States and on 17 January in the United Kingdom. It was issued as the soundtrack to the animated film of the same name, which premiered in London in July 1968. The album contains six songs by the Beatles, including four new songs and the previously released \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"All You Need Is Love\". The remainder of the album is a re-recording of the film's orchestral soundtrack by the band's producer, George Martin. The project was regarded as a contractual obligation by the Beatles, who were asked to supply four new songs for the film. Some were written and recorded specifically for the soundtrack, while others were unreleased tracks from other projects. The album was recorded before \u2013 and issued two months after \u2013 the band's self-titled double LP (also known as the \"White Album\") and was not viewed by the band as a significant release. An EP containing only the new songs had been considered, and was mastered, but left unreleased. The original mono mixes were later included in the 2009 compilation Mono Masters. Yellow Submarine reached the top 5 in the UK and the US. It has since been afforded a mixed reception from music critics, some of whom consider that it falls short of the high standard generally associated with the Beatles' work. Another version of the album, the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, was issued on the film's 30th anniversary. It dispenses with the George Martin orchestrations, and includes the six Beatles songs from the original album, along with an additional nine songs heard in the film, all newly remixed."

        "content": "Only one side of the album contains songs performed by the Beatles; of the six, two of them were previously released. \"Yellow Submarine\" had been issued in August 1966 as a single, topping the UK chart for four weeks, and had also been released on the album Revolver. Following the Beatles' performance of the song on the Our World international television broadcast, \"All You Need Is Love\" had been issued as a single as well, in July 1967, and had also been included on the Capitol Records LP release of Magical Mystery Tour in November 1967. A stereo mix was made of this song on 29 October 1968 for release on this album. Of the unreleased tracks, the first to be recorded was George Harrison's \"Only a Northern Song\", taped in February 1967 but rejected for inclusion on Sgt. Pepper. The group performed overdubs on this basic track in April, immediately after completing the stereo mixes for that album. Among the sounds added during what Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn describes as \"a curious session\", were trumpet, glockenspiel and spoken voices. Harrison's lyrics reflect his displeasure at being merely a contracted songwriter to the Beatles' publishing company, Northern Songs. \"All Together Now\" was recorded in a single session on 12 May 1967, specifically for the film project. The title came from a phrase Paul McCartney had heard as a child, to encourage everyone to sing music hall songs. He later described the song as \"a throwaway\". The band recorded Harrison's \"It's All Too Much\" in late May 1967 at De Lane Lea Studios in central London. Inspired by its author's experimentation with the drug LSD, and originally running to over eight minutes in length, the song reflects the Summer of Love philosophy of 1967 and makes extensive use of guitar feedback. As with the later recorded \"All You Need Is Love\", the track includes musical and lyrical quotations from other works \u2013 in this case, a trumpet passage from Jeremiah Clarke's \"Prince of Denmark's March\" and a lyric from the Merseys' 1966 hit \"Sorrow\". John Lennon's \"Hey Bulldog\" was recorded on 11 February 1968 and evolved from an initial intent to shoot a promotional film for the single \"Lady Madonna\". Like \"All Together Now\", it was specifically recorded with the film soundtrack in mind. The track's ending contained a jam session after the point where a fade-out was intended in the final mix, which was kept in the finished version. Lennon later described the song as \"a good-sounding record that means nothing\"."

The recording took place with a 41-piece orchestra over two three-hour sessions on 22 and 23 October 1968 in Abbey Road, and was edited down to the length on the LP on 22 November. In some of his arrangements, Martin referenced his past work with the Beatles; for example, \"Sea of Time\" includes what MacDonald terms \"an affectionate quotation\" from the Indian-styled \"Within You Without You\", from Sgt. Pepper, and \"Yellow Submarine in Pepperland\" reprises the film's title track. In \"Sea of Monsters\", Martin included the beginning of Bach's Air on the G String, while in other selections he parodies works by Stravinsky. MacDonald also detects the influence of Mozart and Webern among the \"classical allusions\" in Martin's score."

        "content": "The film received its worldwide premiere in London in July 1968, by which time the Beatles were busy working on their self-titled double album, commonly called \"the White Album\". After viewing the finished film, the Beatles were much more enthusiastic and did more to associate themselves with it after its release. Having been delayed so that it would not clash with the release of The Beatles, and to allow for the re-recording of Martin's contributions, Yellow Submarine was issued by Apple Records on 13 January 1969 in the US and on 17 January in the UK. The album was issued in stereo only in the US, while the UK album was available in both stereo and mono, although the mono version is simply a fold-down (a combination of two stereo channels into one mono) rather than a specific mix. Since \"All You Need Is Love\" had been rush-released as a single, it did not have an official stereo mix. Although the track was released on the US LP Magical Mystery Tour, an official stereo mix of the track was not made until 29 October 1968 for the album. In the US, 8-track tape and cassette tape versions included \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", which was also heard in the film, as an additional song. In contrast to the animated film, Yellow Submarine was not generally considered to be a significant release. Issued two months after The Beatles, it was one of the few Beatles releases that failed to top the charts in either the United Kingdom or the United States, peaking instead at number 3 and number 2, respectively. In Canada, Yellow Submarine topped the RPM national albums chart for two weeks, ending the White Album's 12-week run at number 1. On America's Billboard Top LPs chart, it was kept from the top by the same album."

The review was introduced by a few liner notes by Apple press officer Derek Taylor. The US cover contained a fictitious illustrated biography by Dan Davis of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, in which the ensemble's battle with the Blue Meanies was compared to three other epic struggles in the history of the English-speaking world: Beowulf's struggle to save the Heorot mead hall, King John's signing of the Magna Carta and Thomas Jefferson's writing of the Declaration of Independence."

        "content": "An EP containing the new songs had been considered for release in September 1968, but any plan to issue the soundtrack music from Yellow Submarine was then postponed to allow for the White Album's unveiling. Following the delayed release of the soundtrack album, however, Lewisohn writes that the Beatles were \"mildly criticised\" for issuing a new LP with just four new songs and having ceded a full LP side to Martin's music and thereby failing to provide their customary \"excellent value-for-money\". As a result, the band decided to reissue Yellow Submarine as a five-track mono EP, without the film score but including the then-unreleased \"Across the Universe\" as a bonus track. This EP was mastered in March 1969 but was never issued. The original running order for the EP was \"Only a Northern Song\", \"Hey Bulldog\" and \"Across the Universe\" on side one, with \"All Together Now\" and \"It's All Too Much\" on side two. Lennon later dismissed Martin's contributions as \"all this terrible shit\" and blamed Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager, for allowing Martin to participate in the project. According to author and music journalist Peter Doggett, neither the proposed EP format nor an expanded soundtrack album (containing other previously issued Beatles songs that appear in the 1968 film) was possible at the time, since \"both options would have denied George Martin his contractual right to appear alongside The Beatles \u2013 and robbed him of potentially the largest royalty payment of his career.\""

        "content": "Recalling the album's release in a special-edition issue of Mojo magazine, Peter Doggett writes that \"The papers got all trippy for Yellow Submarine\". Beat Instrumental bemoaned the paucity of new material by the band, but added: \"be not of bad cheer. The George Martin score to the film is really very nice, and two tracks by George Harrison redeem the first side. Both [songs] are superb pieces, considerably more enthralling than the most draggy All Together Now, a rather wet track.\" In a review for International Times, Barry Miles considered Martin's score \"superbly produced\" and, of the songs, wrote only of \"It's All Too Much\", which he described as, variously, \"Endless, mantric, a round, interwoven, trellised, tessellated, filigreed, gidouiled, spiralling\" and \"Happy singalong music\". Record Mirrors reviewer said that, given the longstanding demand for a soundtrack album, the release of Yellow Submarine would evoke \"the ecstasy of fans the world over\". The reviewer added that the four new Beatles songs matched the quality of the two \"excellent\" hit singles, and Martin's side represented a \"tremendous achievement\" that also justified any complaints about the price. Writing in their 1975 book The Beatles: An Illustrated Record, NME critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler bemoaned the commercial considerations that had resulted in the release of a full soundtrack album, saying that the four new tracks \"would have made a superb EP\". More recently, AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger has written of Yellow Submarine: \"The album would have been far better value if it had been released as a four-song EP ... with the addition of a bonus track in \"Across the Universe\" ... No one would argue that there's a huge amount more than meets the eye (or ear) there, but listening to the original album anew 40 years on, one is still struck by how mostly second-rate, and recycled and rejected Beatles material still sounds so good.\" Writing for Pitchfork Media, Mark Richardson opines that \"the Yellow Submarine soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn't really be bothered\" and describes \"Hey Bulldog\" as \"a tough and funky piano-driven rocker, [and] by a good margin the best song here\". Richardson concludes: \"But as an album it's ultimately forgettable, which is something the Beatles so rarely were otherwise.\" PopMatters' David Gassman views Martin's selections as \"kind of twee and inconsequential\" and the four new songs on side one as \"fascinating\", adding that \"The material's tossed-off origins give it a character unlike any other Beatles album.\" While noting that the soundtrack was superseded with the 1999 release of Yellow Submarine Songtrack, Gassman writes: \"No matter how you get them, though, the otherwise unavailable songs on this album ought to be part of any thinking Beatles fan's collection.\" Alex Young of Consequence of Sound writes: \"as a whole, Yellow Submarine is a delightful album, even if it's still a less-than-acceptable inclusion in the Beatles canon\", though he criticised the inclusion of Martin's score, which he felt should have been sold as a separate release."

Hopkins re-recorded the closing track, \"Edward\", on his solo album The Tin Man Was a Dreamer, which features members of the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. (\u201cEdward\u201d was a nickname for Nicky Hopkins, made up by Brian Jones during a 1967 session at Olympic Studios in London. The story goes that Jones was tuning his guitar and asked Hopkins to give him an E on the piano; with other noise interfering and Nicky unable to hear what he was saying, Brian eventually shouted out: \"Give me an E, like in Edward!\") \"Joseph's Coat\", co-written by John Cipollina and Nick Gravenites, also appears on Big Brother and the Holding Company's album Be a Brother, which featured Gravenites on vocals.

Could you imagine the power we'd have? I think that's where we're headed.\"  He has described the album as a mixture of \"street\" records, \"political\" records and collaborations. In another interview for MTV.com, Nas discussed the concept of the album title and the social atmosphere and condition of the music industry that inspired it, stating: A promo single, \"Where Y'all At\", was released in June 2006 and produced by Salaam Remi. It contained a sample from Nas' \"Made You Look\", but it did not make the final cut for Hip Hop Is Dead. It was, however, released as a bonus track on the Japanese import version of the album. A music video for \"Can't Forget About You\" premiered on February 5, 2007, the song featuring Chrisette Michele and sampling  Nat King Cole's song \"Unforgettable\".

He went on to say that it worked, due to reactions from artists like Lil Wayne and Kanye West (whether West was actually reacting to the title of the album or merely promoting the album is unclear, given that he produced on two of the album's tracks). The title had a major impact in the hip hop world, especially for Southern hip hop, whose artists were blamed at the time for cheapening the quality of hip-hop with crunk and snap music. Southern rapper Young Jeezy had made statements against the title of Nas' album, and also furthered his comments by questioning Nas' street credibility. They have since reconciled, with Nas appearing on Jeezy's 2008 single, \"My President\". Many other Southern rappers such as Ludacris, Trick Daddy, and Big Boi (whose fellow Outkast member, Andre 3000, declared hip hop dead on 2001's \"Funkin' Around\", off Big Boi and Dre Present...Outkast) have also attacked Nas' album title claiming that it is targeted at Southern hip hop. Nas also has a fair share of supporters such as fellow New York rappers KRS-One, DMX, Raekwon, and Ghostface Killah."

Among those music writers and critics that reviewed Hip Hop Is Dead favorably was Jason Rubin of The A.V. Club, which gave the album an A- rating. Rubin praised the album's production quality and lyrical concept, and stated \"Hip Hop is unsparing in its diagnosis of rap's ills, but ultimately, it's hopeful. It contains a smart, tight, cohesive analysis of where rap went astray, but also the seeds of the genre's rebirth and renewal.\" Despite perceiving its sound and musical quality as weaknesses, Los Angeles Times writer Soren Baker gave it 3 out of 4 stars and wrote \"Nas demonstrates why he remains one of rap's most revered artists, as his defense of hip-hop culture is impassioned and informed, if not fully realized\". Sean Fennessey of Vibe called the album \"disorienting and sometimes brilliant\" and complimented its \"bold, startling production and a renewed lyrical vigor\".

It was released on March 23, 2007, by Epic Records. After including some Spanish songs on her first two albums, Lopez initially became interested in recording a full-length studio album in 2004 when she recorded a song with her then-husband Marc Anthony for his ninth studio album. After releasing her fourth studio album, Rebirth (2005), Lopez started working heavily on the album with Anthony, Est\u00e9fano and Julio Reyes Copello in a period of two and a half years. Composed entirely of ballads (and the exception of a few other genres), Como Ama una Mujer talks about love and heartbreak, being organic in its instrumentation and introspective in its lyrics. The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics, with many praising her vocals for being more improved than her previous records, but thought the album was too serious and questioned a lack of highlights within the album. Commercially, the album debuted inside the top ten of the US Billboard 200 and marked the highest first-week sales for an artist's debut Spanish album. Elsewhere, it topped the Switzerland charts and became a top-ten album in eight other countries. Two singles were released from the album: \"Qu\u00e9 Hiciste\" and \"Me Haces Falta\". The first was released on January 26, 2007, and became a success in many countries, reaching number-one in Italy, Spain, Switzerland and on the US Hot Latin Songs, and a top-ten hit elsewhere, while the second single was released  on March 23, 2007, but was a  complete failure. Lopez promoted the album with a co-headlining tour with Anthony in 2007."

        "content": "Prior to breaking out into the music scene in May 1999 with her single \"If You Had My Love\", Lopez always pictured her music career to be in Spanish. Her first demo tape was called \"Vivir Sin Ti\" (\"To Live Without You\"), however former Sony Music president Tommy Mottola persuaded Lopez to do her first album in English. According to Lopez: \"My life took a different turn, which was great for me. But my heart was always kind of on the Spanish side.\" Later, throughout her career as a singer, she included two tracks in Spanish on her debut album, On the 6 (1999), with one being the single \"No Me Ames\" and five on her sophomore studio album, J.Lo (2001). Plans for Lopez to release a full-length Spanish-language album materialized in 2004, when Lopez's then-husband Marc Anthony was finishing up production of his ninth studio album Amar Sin Mentiras (2004) with Est\u00e9fano and Julio Reyes Copello. Lopez went into the recording studio with them to record a song entitled \"Escap\u00e9monos\", as a duet with Anthony. She enjoyed working on the song so much that she decided to record a full-length Spanish album; something she had wanted to do for years. In the same year, she recorded a Spanish version of the song \"Sway\", called \"Qui\u00e9n Ser\u00e1\", for her film Shall We Dance? (2004), but the English version recorded by Pussycat Dolls was used instead. Before recording began for her first Spanish album, Lopez recorded and released her fourth English studio album Rebirth (2005). In early 2006 it was announced that Lopez would release her first Spanish album and her fifth studio album Como Ama una Mujer later that year and that she worked mostly with Colombian record producer Est\u00e9fano, Reyes and Anthony. Amidst the recording process, she was also shooting a film with Anthony, El Cantante (2007) and providing vocals for its soundtrack entirely done by Anthony, as well as recording a more \"urban-leaning\" full-English album. According to Est\u00e9fano, Como Ama una Mujer was going to \"prove critics wrong\" from its \"big songs that require a voice\"; referring to the critics about Lopez having a \"limited\" vocal tone. After working on the album, Lopez said that she matured as singer, stating: \"I've matured as a singer. Marc gave me confidence in the studio as well. When someone believes in you so much, you don't want to let them down. And it's also the material. I think this material lent itself to my voice. And it actually made me approach my new English album in a different way. I have a different standard now\"."

Despite the fact that she speaks Spanish, Lopez didn't write any song on the album. However, she wanted to make sure she was expressing everything accurately. She said: \"You have to have a total command of the language, so I couldn\u2019t write it all myself, you know what I mean?. I had to really depend on people to express what I was feeling.\" Lopez also emphasized that she really expressed to the writers the kind of album she wanted to make and the things that were important for her. She explained: \"I would say, 'This songs needs to be about a person, and when he's leaving,' and they would turn around and write in Spanish.\" She also declared that, emotionally speaking, the album was closer to who she was than any album she had ever done. Como Ama una Mujer is a mainstream, traditional Latin pop album, composed mostly of romantic ballads, differing from her previous urban sounds as well as the rhythmic Latin pop vibe heard that year. It is also known for being \"organic in its instrumentation and introspective in its lyrics.\" The first song written for the album was \"Por Arriesgarnos\" and is a duet with Marc Anthony. Initially, the song wasn't intend to be a duet, with Lopez remarking that \"there was a background male voice, and Marc did the backups. I asked to put his voice up, because I think the harmony parts blended so beautifully.\" Meanwhile, when the album was almost done, the song \"Qu\u00e9 Hiciste\" was a last minute addition and was born after a dream Anthony had with late singer Roc\u00edo Jurado. Lopez explained: \"Marc woke up and said, \u2019I just had the craziest dream.' 'What was the dream?' And he said, 'Roc\u00edo Jurado was in this room and she was saying', 'Come here, get in this room right now, listen to this. This song is for Jennifer,' and she was singing a melody.'\" Then, since she had not studio equipment nearby to capture the essence of the song, she took her phone, called up their answering machine and told him to sing. Later, she called a Spanish writer she was working with to help her with adapting the lyrics."

Lyrically, the song talks about a very intense relationship and how she feels heartbroken with a lover who unraveled her happy home. Lopez remarked that she told Reyes that she wanted a song with a woman saying to her former lover: \"What have you done with our relationship? With our life? We had everything and with your own hands, you destroyed our house.\" \"Me Haces Falta\" (\"I Miss You\") talks about missing someone so badly and feeling desperate and it also has rock influences. The title track, the delicate ballad \"Como Ama una Mujer\" (\"How a Woman Loves\"), opens with piano and a minor-chord progression that was compared to Randy Newman's \"In Germany Before the War\" and a melodic chorus which was noted for being similar to Kenny Rogers' \"She Believes in Me\". The fourth track, \"Te Voy a Querer\" (\"I Will Love You\") is a cumbia flavored track. \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 te Marchas?\" (\"Why You Leave?\") is a Spanish version of \"Can't Believe This Is Me\", a \"dramatic\" ballad from her previous album Rebirth (2005). It features swelling strings in its chorus and it was highlighted for containing strong vocals by Lopez and lyrics about heartbreak. \"Por Arriesgarnos\" (\"By Risking\") is a duet with Anthony about love and the risks that two people in love run. \"T\u00fa\" (\"You\") is an Italian pop song and it features the London Symphony Orchestra. According to Lopez, \"It was an emotion I had about wanting to sing that to a child one day. That's where the song was born from. To sing it to my own child.\" \"Amarte es Todo\" (\"Loving You Is Everything\") and \"Apres\u00farate\" (\"Hurry Up\") are both romantic and passionate ballads about love, while \"Sola\" (\"Alone\") talks about recovering from a heartbreak and features traces of ambient electronica. The last track on the album is \"Adi\u00f3s\" (\"Goodbye\"), a ballad about leaving someone behind and it was recorded live in front of an audience that \"immediately erupts into a sing-along.\""

        "content": "Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page is a live album by English rock group the Yardbirds.  It was recorded at the Anderson Theatre in New York City on 30 March 1968.  At the time, the Yardbirds had been performing as a quartet with Jimmy Page on lead guitar since October 1966. The album includes several familiar Yardbird songs, but often extended with longer instrumental solos.  \"I'm Confused,\" based on Jake Holmes' \"Dazed and Confused\", is a highlight of the album.  Using some different lyrics, Page re-recorded it with Led Zeppelin for their debut album later in 1968. The group was dissatisfied with the recordings and objected to a release of the recordings, but after Page became famous with Led Zeppelin, Epic Records issued the album in September 1971.  Page took legal action and Epic was enjoined from further distribution of the album.  Over the years, there were several more attempts to release the album.  In 2017, Page discovered the concert tapes in his personal archive and remixed the recordings.  An album with the Anderson concert and demo recordings from the same time, were released in November 2017 on Yardbirds '68."

        "content": "Although a live album, Epic Records overdubbed crowd noises from bullfights and other sound effects onto the original tracks against the band's wishes, in part because the live recordings were considered lacking in sound quality. This was a result of the general inexperience of the engineers in recording live rock music. For example, only a single microphone was deployed for the drums, hung above the kit. This resulted in the loss of much of the lower-range percussion in the recording. The Yardbirds rejected the album as a candidate for release upon its original completion in mid-1968, but Epic released it in 1971 in response to Led Zeppelin's success in the marketplace. Page took legal action against the label for releasing Live Yardbirds without authorization and Epic quickly withdrew it. Epic parent CBS' Columbia Special Products (CSP) label subsequently reissued the album in 1976, but this was again legally challenged by Page, and the album again quickly withdrawn. Authentic Epic and CSP copies of Live Yardbirds are thus quite rare, and the album has often been counterfeited (sometimes in black-and-white covers claimed to be promotional copies) as a result.  The album's cover art was designed by James Grashow, a woodcut artist who had earlier created the artwork for Jethro Tull's 1969 album Stand Up."

It was entered into the 1966 Cannes Film Festival where a \"Special Mention\" was made of Tot\u00f2, for his acting performance. The film can be described as partially neorealist, and deals with Marxist concerns about poverty and class-conflict. It features the popular Italian comic-actor Tot\u00f2 accompanied on a journey by his son (played by Ninetto Davoli). This is the last film to star Tot\u00f2 before his untimely death of a heart attack in 1967."

        "content": "Tot\u00f2 and his son Ninetto roam the neighbourhood and the countryside of Rome. During the walk they observe a body being removed from a house following a murder. They next encounter a talking crow, who is described in the intertitles thus: \"For the benefit of those who were not paying attention or are in doubt, we remind you that the Crow is \u2013 as you say \u2013 a left-wing intellectual of the kind found living before Palmiro Togliatti's death\"). The Crow subsequently recounts the tale of \"Fra Ciccillo\" and \"Fra Ninetto\" (still played by Tot\u00f2 and Ninetto), two Franciscan friars, who are bid by St. Francis to preach the Gospel to the hawks (representing the powerful) and the sparrows (representing the weak). After many failures they discover the language of birds and succeed in preaching the commandment of love unto the species separately, but are not able to get them to love each other. The hawks continue to kill and eat the sparrows, as it is in their nature. Saint Francis explains the relationship between the two groups to them from a Marxist perspective and invites them to continue proselytizing. After the tale, the journey of Tot\u00f2 and Ninetto carries on, the Crow still accompanying them. They encounter other individuals: land-owners who order them off their land when they are caught defecating; a family living in absolute poverty with no food and whom Tot\u00f2 threatens to drive out of the house if the rent is not paid; a group of travelling actors (representing figures marginalised from society such as women, gays, the elderly, racial minorities, and the disabled) and who persuade the pair to push the group's Cadillac car for them; and a rich man who is waiting for Tot\u00f2 to give him the money he owes him (in contrast to the earlier episode where Toto had demanded rent). This is followed by news footage of the funeral of Palmiro Togliatti, the long-time leader of the Italian Communist Party. Finally, after having met a prostitute, the two end up killing and eating the Crow, whom they found to be unconscionably boring. Pasolini declared that Uccellacci e uccellini was his favourite film, as it was the only one that did not disappoint his expectations. Ennio Morricone's opening theme music features Domenico Modugno singing the movie's credits."

Pasolini chose to cast Tot\u00f2 as the protagonist as he felt his comedic style represented the two aspects of humanity: extravagance and humanity. Pasolini chose to use both non-professional actors from off the streets and Italian cinematic icons like Tot\u00f2 because he felt the brutality of the amateur and the lightness of the professional worked together. Tot\u00f2 was used to choosing his own jokes and ad-libbing his own lines but for this film he learned to respect Pasolini's script and direction. Carlo Croccolo offered to dub Tot\u00f2 for Pasolini as he worked on the dubbing for many of Tot\u00f2's other films but Pasolini refused this. Scenes had to frequently be reshot as the crow kept trying to claw at Tot\u00f2's eyes. Thus a system was devised where the crow's cage was placed behind the camera and the crow would chase after it."

        "content": "Moon was the last member of the Who to release a solo album: by this point, John Entwistle had released Smash Your Head Against the Wall (with Moon playing percussion and singing backing vocals), Roger Daltrey released his hit album Daltrey, and Pete Townshend had produced several Meher Baba tribute albums and the demo compilation Who Came First. Moon had moved into the Beverly Wilshire Hotel with assistant Dougal Butler in March 1974, to play on the sessions for Harry Nilsson's Pussy Cats. The album was produced by John Lennon, who had been ejected from The Troubadour with Nilsson for drunkenly heckling a Smothers Brothers performance several days before Moon's arrival. The three, along with Ringo Starr (who also drummed on Pussy Cats), Lennon's girlfriend May Pang, bassist Klaus Voormann, Voormann's girlfriend Cynthia Webb, and Starr's manager Hilary Gerrard, moved together into a Santa Monica beach house for three weeks. The sessions were affected by Lennon, Nilsson, Moon and Starr's excessive lifestyles and drug abuse, ultimately prompting Lennon to relocate the sessions to New York City to separate himself and Nilsson from the Los Angeles party scene. At the time of Moon's arrival, Lennon had made initial recordings for Rock 'n' Roll with Phil Spector, and David Bowie and Bryan Ferry had also released cover albums; Bowie's Pin Ups notably included two songs by The Who, \"I Can't Explain\" and \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\". Encountering The Beatles' former road manager Mal Evans on the Sunset Strip, Moon suggested that Evans produce a solo album for him. The first song, a cover of The Beach Boys' \"Don't Worry Baby\", was recorded in late March at the Record Plant Studios, with musicians that included John Sebastian, Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, Jesse Ed Davis, and Miguel Ferrer playing drums. Kaylan described the album as \"a fantasy record for him\", allowing him to live out his fantasy to \"be a Beach Boy\". For this reason, Moon largely avoided playing the drums, as he considered drumming his \"job\". Moon left Los Angeles on 19 April to begin filming Tommy, and after the filming concluded, unofficially relocated to California in August 1974, to work on the album proper. The album would be funded by a deal directly with Los Angeles' MCA Records arranged by Bill Curbishley and Peter Rudge, as funding was unavailable from London due to Track Records' legal problems with former Who managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, and Moon's extravagant spending habits that led to reluctance to fund the sessions. Biographer Tony Fletcher expresses astonishment in Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon that MCA approved the album's recording and released the \"travesty of a Beach Boys cover\" as a single rather than rejecting the master tapes for \"Don't Worry Baby\". Much like the difficulties that befell Pussy Cats and Rock 'n' Roll, the sessions for Two Sides of the Moon were affected by the \"lazy and decadent self-indulgence that permeated the superstar scene of mid-seventies LA\". The routine of inconsistent working hours and lengthy indulgence, particularly of alcohol and drugs, slowed down the sessions considerably; the atmosphere of the studio resembled that of a club. One of the album's engineers, Gary Ladinsky, recalled: \"You'd get something done for an hour, and then it's a party scene. Eventually, you clear out the studio and you might do something for another half an hour, and then people wander out, and you realise, 'I guess the session is over.'\" After \"Teenage Idol\", with Dick Dale guesting on guitar, was delivered to MCA, Evans was fired as producer, which Fletcher attributes to Moon's realisation that the sessions were largely fruitless and Evans' own drinking problem was worsening. He was replaced as producer by Skip Taylor, who was described by Volman and engineer John Stronach as the main provider of drugs for the sessions. Taylor did not dispute the assessment: \"I would go in and decide, is this a night where we should have a little brandy, or should we smoke some stuff, or should we put a couple of lines out?\" Most of the musicians involved saw no real difference as a result of the change. Kaylan commented that after recording his parts twice, \"Basically it was the same record.\" Joe Walsh, who was then recording So What with Stronach at the Record Plant, was brought in to play additional guitar on \"The Kids Are Alright\" late in the sessions. He described the results as \"semi-train wrecks\" and expressed surprise that Moon had only used two producers since he would \"fry\" anyone who worked with him. Moon's contributions to the album were primarily vocals. He only played drums on three songs, simultaneously accompanied by session drummers. Stronach said that the sessions had two drummers: \"One to keep time and then Keith to play over it.\" The first set of vocals recorded with Evans was discarded, as all had been recorded while Moon was inebriated; Taylor characterised them as \"a guy from England trying to sound like a guy from Nashville but having about five belts before he did it.\" Taylor demanded that Moon abandon the country twang in which he had sung the early songs (and which is noticeable on outtakes such as \"I'm Not Angry\"), and sing in the posh accent he regularly mimicked. Fletcher comments that so many musicians were brought in to try to \"salvage\" the record (sixty being credited on the final album, with several others such as Brian Wilson having been rumoured to have contributed as well) that it resulted in Moon sounding more like \"the guest on someone else's record\". Moon's behaviour during the sessions reflected his self-destructive lifestyle and worsening health. Recording vocals one night in Studio B under a low ceiling covered in spotlights, he smashed a light bulb with an ashtray every time recording was stopped because he failed to hit a note, ending up destroying the entire light fixture. Stronach recalled, \"He'd come in, reach into his pockets, and there'd be pills and cocaine falling out.\" While Moon had previously been able to sing adequately on several songs from the A Quick One, Ready Steady Who and The Who Sell Out sessions, his strained and frequently off-key vocals on Two Sides of the Moon contributed to feelings of inadequacy and depression throughout recording. MCA's then-president Mike Maitland told Taylor at their first meeting that a lot of money had been invested before he assumed production duties, and that MCA was \"prepared to spend an enormous sum of money in promotion and marketing\". This was exactly what happened: Fletcher states that \"well over $200,000\" was spent for \"recording costs alone\", and that Moon claimed to receive a non-returnable advance for the same amount. With the album being prepared for release in 1975, MCA initially refused to pay for the elaborate sleeve designed by Gary Stromberg. Moon, Taylor and Stronach went to meet with Maitland; Moon asked Taylor to stop in front of an Army and Navy store on the way, and returned with a fire axe, which he kept hidden on himself. Maitland once again denied their sleeve request, criticising them for the excessive cost of the album. Moon responded by placing himself directly in front of Maitland and held the fire axe above Maitland's mahogany partners desk, and said, \"What's it going to be, dear boy? My album cover or a new desk?\""

        "content": "Rather than using the album as a chance to showcase his drumming skill, Moon sang lead vocals on all tracks, and played drums only on three of the tracks (\"Crazy Like a Fox\", \"The Kids Are Alright\" and \"Move Over Ms. L\"), although he played percussion on \"Don't Worry Baby\". The album features contributions from Ringo Starr, Harry Nilsson, Joe Walsh of the Eagles, Jim Keltner, Bobby Keys, Klaus Voormann, John Sebastian, Flo & Eddie (Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan of The Turtles), Spencer Davis, Dick Dale, Suzi Quatro's sister Patti Quatro, Patti's bandmates from Fanny Jean Millington and Nickey Barclay, and future actor Miguel Ferrer. Moon covered Barclay's song \"Solid Gold\" which was originally recorded by Fanny. Originally recorded for his own album, but not released on it, John Lennon gave Moon the track \"Move Over Ms. L\" and later did his own version. Moon subsequently started work on a second solo album, which was never completed. Two Sides of the Moon was re-released by Repertoire Records in 1997, including the finished songs that Moon had made for his second album. Two Sides of the Moon was again re-released by Castle Music and Sanctuary Records in July 2006, as a two-disc Deluxe Edition, featuring the original 10 songs plus 41 bonus tracks."

        "content": "Come and See (, Idi i smotri; , Idzi i hliadzi) is a 1985 Soviet anti-war film directed by Elem Klimov and starring Aleksei Kravchenko and Olga Mironova. Its screenplay, written by Klimov and Ales Adamovich, is based on the 1978 book I Am from the Fiery Village (original title: \u042f \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438, Ya iz ognennoj derevni, 1977), of which Adamovich was a co-author. Klimov had to fight eight years of censorship from the Soviet authorities before he could be allowed to produce the film in its entirety. The film's plot focuses on the Nazi German occupation of Belarus, and the events as witnessed by a young Belarusian partisan teenager named Flyora, who\u2014against his mother's wishes\u2014joins the Belarusian resistance movement, and thereafter depicts the Nazi atrocities and human suffering inflicted upon the Eastern European villages' populace. The film mixes hyper-realism with an underlying surrealism, and philosophical existentialism with poetical, psychological, political and apocalyptic themes. Come and See received generally positive critical reception upon release, and received the FIPRESCI prize at the 14th Moscow International Film Festival. It has since come to be considered one of the greatest films of all time."

        "content": "In 1943, two Belarusian boys dig in a sand-filled trench looking for abandoned rifles in order to join the Soviet partisan forces. Their village elder warns them not to dig up the weapons as it would arouse the suspicions of the occupying Germans. One of the boys, Flyora, finds an SVT-40 rifle, though both of them are seen by an Fw 189 flying overhead. The next day two partisans arrive at Flyora's house, to conscript him. Flyora becomes a low-rank militiaman and is ordered to perform menial tasks. When the partisans are ready to move on, the partisan commander, Kosach, says that Flyora is to remain behind at the camp. Bitterly disappointed, Flyora walks into the forest weeping and meets Glasha, a young girl working as a nurse in the camp, and the two bond before the camp is suddenly attacked by German paratroopers and dive bombers. Flyora is partially deafened from the explosions before the two hide in the forest to avoid the German soldiers. Flyora and Glasha travel to his village, only to find his home deserted and covered in flies. Denying that his family is dead, Flyora believes that they are hiding on a nearby island across a bog. As they run from the village in the direction of the bogland, Glasha glances across her shoulder, seeing a pile of executed villagers' bodies stacked behind a house, but does not alert Flyora. The two become hysterical after wading through the bog, where Glasha then screams at Flyora that his family is actually dead in the village; resulting in the latter attempting to drown her. They are soon met by Rubezh, a partisan fighter, who takes them to a large group of villagers who have fled the Germans. Flyora sees the village elder, badly burnt by the Germans, who tells him that he witnessed his family's execution and that he should not have dug up the rifles. Flyora, hearing this, then attempts suicide out of guilt, but Glasha and the villagers save and comfort him. Rubezh takes Flyora and two other men to find food at a nearby warehouse, only to find it being guarded by German troops. During their retreat, the group unknowingly wanders through a minefield resulting in the deaths of the two companions. That evening Rubezh and Flyora sneak up to an occupied village and manage to steal a cow from a collaborating farmer. As they escape across an open field, Rubezh and the cow are shot and killed by a German machine gun. The next morning, Flyora attempts to steal a horse and cart but the owner catches him and instead of doing him harm, he helps hide Flyora's identity when SS troops approach. Flyora is taken to the village of Perekhody, where they hurriedly discuss a fake identity for him, while the SS unit, accompanied by Soviet collaborators surround and occupy the village. Flyora tries to warn the townsfolk as they are being herded to their deaths, but is forced to join them inside a wooden church. Flyora and a young girl are allowed to escape the church, but the latter is dragged by her hair across the ground and into a truck to be gang raped. Flyora is forced to watch as several Molotov cocktails and grenades are thrown onto and within the church before it is further set ablaze with a flamethrower as other soldiers shoot into the building. A German officer points a gun to Flyora's head to pose for a picture before leaving him to slump to the ground as the soldiers leave. Flyora later wanders out of the scorched village in the direction of the Germans, where he discovers they had been ambushed by the partisans. After recovering his jacket and rifle, Flyora comes across the young girl in a fugue state, her legs and face covered in blood after having been gang-raped and brutalized by German forces. Flyora returns to the village and finds that his fellow partisans have captured eleven of the Germans and their collaborators, including the commander, an SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer. While some of the captured men including the commander and main collaborator plead for their lives and deflect blame, a young fanatical officer, an Obersturmf\u00fchrer, is unapologetic and vows they will carry out their genocidal mission. Kosach makes the collaborator douse the Germans with a can of petrol brought there by Flyora, but the disgusted crowd shoots them all before they can be set on fire. As the partisans leave, Flyora notices a framed portrait of Adolf Hitler in a puddle and proceeds to shoot it numerous times. As he does so, a montage of clips from Hitler's life play in reverse, but when Hitler is shown as a baby on his mother's lap, Flyora stops shooting and cries. A title card informs: \"628 Belorussian villages were destroyed, along with all their inhabitants\" (alternate translations: \"628 Belarusian villages were burnt to the ground with all their inhabitants\"; \"The Nazis burned down 628 Byelorussian villages together with all the people in them\"). Flyora rushes to rejoin his comrades, and they march through the birch woods as snow blankets the ground."

        "content": "Klimov co-wrote the screenplay with Ales Adamovich, who fought with the Belarusian partisans as a teenager. According to the director's recollections, work on the film began in 1977: For eight years, filming could not begin because the State Committee for Cinematography (Goskino) would not accept the screenplay, considering it too realistic, calling it propaganda for the \"aesthetics of dirtiness\" and \"naturalism\". Alongside this, the death of his wife Larisa Shepitko, also a filmmaker, in 1979 forced him to first complete the work she began on what was to be her next film, Farewell; it would finally be released in 1983. Eventually in 1984, Klimov was able to start filming without having compromised to any censorship at all. The only change became the name of the film itself, which was changed to Come and See from the original title, Kill Hitler (Elem Klimov also says this in the 2006 UK DVD release). The film was shot in chronological order over a period of nine months. Aleksei Kravchenko said that he underwent \"the most debilitating fatigue and hunger. I kept a most severe diet, and after the filming was over I returned to school not only thin, but grey-haired.\" Contrary to what some rumors suggest, though, Kravchenko's hair did not turn permanently grey. In fact, a special Silber Interference Grease-Paint, alongside a thin layer of actual silver, was used to dye his hair. This made it difficult to get his hair back to normal, so Kravchenko had to live with his hair like this for some time after shooting the film. To prepare the 14-year-old Kravchenko for the role, Klimov called a hypnotist. \"[Kravchenko's acting] could have had a very sad ending. He could have landed in an insane asylum,\" Mr. Klimov said. \"I realized I had to inject him with content which he did not possess,\" \"This is an age when a boy does not know what true hatred is, what true love is.\" In the end, Mr. Kravchenko was able to concentrate so intensely that it seemed as if he had hypnotized himself for the role\" with some autogenic training. To create the maximum sense of immediacy, realism, hyperrealism, and surrealism operate in equal measure, Klimov and his cameraman Rodionov employed naturalistic colors, widescreen and lots of Steadicam shots; the film is full of extreme close-ups of faces, does not flinch from the unpleasant details of burnt flesh and bloodied corpses, and the guns were often loaded with live ammunition as opposed to blanks. Aleksei Kravchenko mentioned in interviews that bullets sometimes passed just 4 inches (10 centimeters) above his head (such as in the cow scene). At the same time \"the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne is fragmentary and disjointed: there are discontinuities between shots as characters appear in close up and then disappear off camera.\" \"Klimov employs a range of techniques that draws attention to the camera. The extreme close-ups of actors staring into camera is a recurring motif.\" \"Elsewhere\u00a0... the moment of revelation is marked by a disorienting zoom-in/dolly-out shot\"."

And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."

Powerful material, powerfully rendered\u00a0...\", and dismissed the ending as \"a dose of instant inspirationalism,\" but conceded to Klimov's \"unquestionable talent.\" Rita Kempley, of The Washington Post, wrote that \"directing with an angry eloquence, [Klimov] taps into that hallucinatory nether world of blood and mud and escalating madness that Francis Ford Coppola found in Apocalypse Now. And though he draws a surprisingly vivid performance from his inexperienced teen lead, Klimov's prowess is his visual poetry, muscular and animistic, like compatriot Andrei Konchalovsky's in his epic Siberiade.\" Mark Le Fanu wrote in Sight & Sound that Come and See is a \"powerful war film\u00a0... The director has elicited an excellent performance from his central actor Kravchenko\". According to Klimov, the film was so shocking for audiences, however, that ambulances were sometimes called in to take away particularly impressionable viewers, both in the Soviet Union and abroad. During one of the after-the-film discussions, an elderly German man stood up and said: \"I was a soldier of the Wehrmacht; moreover, an officer of the Wehrmacht. I traveled through all of Poland and Belarus, finally reaching Ukraine. I will testify: everything that is told in this film is the truth. And the most frightening and shameful thing for me is that this film will be seen by my children and grandchildren\"."

        "content": "The film has since been widely acclaimed in the 21st century. In 2001 Daneet Steffens of Entertainment Weekly wrote that \"Klimov alternates the horrors of war with occasional fairy tale-like images; together they imbue the film with an unapologetically disturbing quality that persists long after the credits roll.\" In 2001, J. Hoberman of The Village Voice reviewed Come and See, writing the following: \"Directed for baroque intensity, Come and See is a robust art film with aspirations to the visionary \u2013 not so much graphic as leisurely literal-minded in its representation of mass murder. (The movie has been compared both to Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, and it would not be surprising to learn that Steven Spielberg had screened it before making either of these.) The film's central atrocity is a barbaric circus of blaring music and barking dogs in which a squadron of drunken German soldiers round up and parade the peasants to their fiery doom\u00a0... The bit of actual death-camp corpse footage that Klimov uses is doubly disturbing in that it retrospectively diminishes the care with which he orchestrates the town's destruction. For the most part, he prefers to show the Gorgon as reflected in Perseus's shield. There are few images more indelible than the sight of young Aleksei Kravchenko's fear-petrified expression.\" In the same publication in 2009, Elliott Stein described Come and See as \"a startling mixture of lyrical poeticism and expressionist nightmare.\" In 2002, Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club wrote that Klimov's \"impressions are unforgettable: the screaming cacophony of a bombing run broken up by the faint sound of a Mozart fugue, a dark, arid field suddenly lit up by eerily beautiful orange flares, German troops appearing like ghosts out of the heavy morning fog. A product of the glasnost era, Come and See is far from a patriotic memorial of Russia's hard-won victory. Instead, it's a chilling reminder of that victory's terrible costs.\" British magazine The Word wrote that \"Come and See is widely regarded as the finest war film ever made, though possibly not by Great Escape fans.\" Tim Lott wrote in 2009 that the film \"makes Apocalypse Now look lightweight\". In 2006, Geoffrey Macnab of Sight & Sound wrote: \"Klimov's astonishing war movie combines intense lyricism with the kind of violent bloodletting that would make even Sam Peckinpah pause\". On 16 June 2010, Roger Ebert posted a review of Come and See as part of his \"Great Movies\" series, describing it as \"one of the most devastating films ever about anything, and in it, the survivors must envy the dead\u00a0... The film depicts brutality and is occasionally very realistic, but there's an overlay of muted nightmarish exaggeration\u00a0... I must not describe the famous sequence at the end. It must unfold as a surprise for you. It pretends to roll back history. You will see how. It is unutterably depressing, because history can never undo itself, and is with us forever.\" Come and See appears on many lists of films considered the best. In 2008, Come and See was placed at number 60 on Empire magazine's \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\" in 2008. It also made Channel 4's list of 50 Films to See Before You Die and was ranked number 24 in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010. Phil de Semlyen of Empire has described the work as \"Elim  Klimov\u2019s seriously influential, deeply unsettling Belarusian opus. No film \u2013 not Apocalypse Now, not Full Metal Jacket \u2013 spells out the dehumanizing impact of conflict more vividly, or ferociously\u00a0... An impressionist masterpiece and possibly the worst date movie ever.\" It ranked 154 among critics, and 30 among directors, in the 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films ever made. The film is generally considered one of the greatest anti-war movies ever made, and one with the most historically accurate depictions of the crimes on the Eastern Front. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97%, based on 36 reviews, and an average rating of 8.50/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"As effectively anti-war as movies can be, Come and See is a harrowing odyssey through the worst that humanity is capable of, directed with bravura intensity by Elem Klimov.\" Klimov did not make any more films after Come and See, leading some critics to speculate as to why. In 2001, Klimov said, \"I lost interest in making films\u00a0... Everything that was possible I felt I had already done.\""

Bryan Blackburn later wrote English-language lyrics for it. First performed in French by Greek singer Vicky Leandros (appearing as Vicky) as the  entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1967, it has since been recorded by many other musicians, most notably French orchestra leader Paul Mauriat, whose familiar instrumental version (recorded in late 1967) became the only number-one hit by a French lead artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 in America. The song describes the pleasure and pain of love in terms of colours (blue and grey) and elements (water and wind). The English lyrics (\"Blue, blue, my world is blue \u2026\") focus on colours only (blue, grey, red, green, and black), using them to describe components of lost love. The English version by Vicky Leandros also appeared as \"Colours of Love\" in some locations including the UK."

Some forty years after its original release, \"L'amour est bleu\", along with Domenico Modugno's \"Nel blu dipinto di blu\" (better known as \"Volare\") and Mocedades' \"Eres t\u00fa\", still counts as one of very few non-winning Eurovision entries ever to become a worldwide hit. Greek-born Leandros recorded the song both in French and English, and had a modest hit in Europe with it, but in Japan and Canada (#40) she had a big hit with this song. She also recorded it in German (as \"Blau wie das Meer\"), Italian (\"L'amore \u00e8 blu\") and Dutch (\"Liefde is zacht\") . The song has since become a favourite of Contest fans, most notably appearing as part of a medley introducing the semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 in Athens, one of only three non-winning songs to be involved (the others being \"Dschinghis Khan\" and \"Nel blu dipinto di blu\"). It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1968 contest by Chris Baldo & Sophie Garel with \"Nous vivrons d'amour\". Vicky Leandros went on to win the Contest five years later with the song \"Apr\u00e8s toi\", again representing Luxembourg."

Mauriat's version became a gold record, and its five-week run at the top is the second longest of any instrumental of the Hot 100 era, after \"Theme from A Summer Place\". The song also spent 11 weeks atop Billboard's Easy Listening survey, and held the longest-lasting title honours on this chart for 25 years. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 2 song for 1968. It is the best-known version of the song in the United States.  The Mauriat recording also reached number 2 in Canada (#12 Year End), and number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. The Mauriat album containing \"Love Is Blue\", Blooming Hits, also reached #1 on the Billboard Top LP's and Tapes chart for five weeks. Mauriat's version was featured repeatedly in an episode of Chris Carter's television series Millennium titled \"A Room with No View\", which originally aired on 24 April 1998 on the Fox Network. During the episode, the omnipresent melody is used by a kidnapper to brainwash a group of youths. His version is also briefly heard in The Simpsons episodes \"There's No Disgrace Like Home\" and \"The Blue and the Gray.\" It was played over the closing credits of Mad Men'''s sixth-season episode \"The Flood\", which takes place during April 1968. The harpsichord riff from Mauriat's version was also sampled by the English electronica duo J Walk in their song \"French Letter\", as part of their 2002 album A Night on the Rocks."

In 1956, \"Podmoskovnye Vechera\" was recorded by Vladimir Troshin, a young actor of the Moscow Art Theatre, for a scene in a documentary about the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic's athletic competition Spartakiad in which the athletes rest in Podmoskovye, the Moscow suburbs. The film did nothing to promote the song, but thanks to radio broadcasts it gained considerable popularity. In 1957, quite to the surprise of its creators, the song won both the first prize at the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students held in Moscow and the international song contest. The song spread around the world, achieving particular popularity in mainland China. Van Cliburn's arrangement of the tune, first performed by himself in the International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1958, contributed to this international spread."

This version peaked at number two on  the UK Singles Chart in January 1962. \"Midnight in Moscow\" also reached number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in March that year, (kept out of the number one spot by, \"Hey! Baby\" by Bruce Channel), while it spent three weeks at number one on the American Easy Listening chart. In 1962, at the height of the folk revival in the United States, the song was recorded by The Chad Mitchell Trio on their popular live performance album At the Bitter End on Kapp Records. The group introduced the song with its original Russian lyrics to the American mainstream audience during the Cold War era of strained relations between the U.S. and the USSR. Swedish pianist Jan Johansson recorded a jazzy version of the song. It was named \"Kv\u00e4llar i Moskvas F\u00f6rst\u00e4der\", literally \"Evenings in Moscow's suburbs\" and was released in 1967. In 1999 German heavy metal band U.D.O used Moscow Nights for the guitar solo in the song \"Shout it Out\" from the album Holy. A year later the Scorpions adapted it as an intro of the symphonic version of its song \"Crossfire\" - as part of the Deadly Sting Suite - on the Moment Of Glory album. The Chinese composer Gao Ping used the song in 2003 as the basis for one of his Soviet Love Songs for Vocalising Pianist, \"Evenings in Suburban Moscow.\" By his use, he was confirming the popularity of the song during the Communist era of China, a time when cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China were particularly strong. A special piano version was used to accompany the ribbon routine of Russian rhythmic gymnast Evgeniya Kanaeva who became an Olympic champion at the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics. The Russian pop singer Vitas recorded a version of the song with his counter-tenor voice. He performed it at several Chinese festivals before its release in November 2010. The song was used in a folk style combined with Katyusha in a medley in 2012 by Uzbek rhythmic gymnast Ulyana Trofimova for her ball routine and in 2014 for Russian rhythmic gymnast Yana Kudryavtseva in her clubs routine. In 2015, the Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison, under the direction of Lieutenant General Valery Khalilov, performed a march arrangement of the song during the march past of foreign contingents (specifically those from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus and Kazakhstan) in the Moscow Victory Day Parade that year. In June 2018, the English teenage composer Alma Deutscher adapted the song for piano to entertain Russian President Vladimir Putin during a State Visit to Austria, at the request of Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. Given three days to arrange it, Deutscher started with a sad lament that transformed itself into a Viennese waltz. Kurz explained that the melding of the two musical styles illustrated well the bond of friendship between Austria and Russia. Deutscher repeated the arrangement as an encore during her recital at the Lucerne Festival on 29 August 2018."

A slightly different version of the album was also released in the U.S. in 1968 as Sire Records SES 97012, one of the first releases on that label.  Although it was not a success when it was first released, it is now widely regarded as one of the best psychedelic rock albums ever made. The lack of commercial success can be explained by the long delay between initial recording sessions in spring 1967 and final release in February 1968.  By the time the album arrived in record stores the psychedelic trend had already begun to abate.  EMI provided a very small recording budget and would not allow prints of a colour album cover to be made, although some later re-issues were printed with a modified colour cover.

The 20 volumes of the encyclopedia were published successively between 1994 and 2001; a one-volume supplement was published in 2002 and two index volumes in 2003. The work comprises 115,000 articles, ranging in size from single-line cross references to the 130-page entry on Denmark. The articles were written by a staff of about 4,000 academic experts led by editor-in-chief J\u00f8rn Lund. Articles longer than a few dozen lines are signed by their authors. Many articles are illustrated. The encyclopedia was published by Danmarks Nationalleksikon A/S (Denmark's National Encyclopedia), a subsidiary of Denmark's publishing house Gyldendal that was set up for the purpose. The project was inspired by the almost contemporary Swedish Nationalencyklopedin; it received financial support from the Augustinus Foundation and was backed by a governmental inflation guarantee on pre-paid subscriptions. Eventually about 35,000 copies were sold."

The free online version was published using wiki software, opening up for user contributions. The decision to offer it free of charge was criticized by buyers of the DKK 25,000 (approx US$4,500 (2010)) paper encyclopedia, to whom the publishing house originally had pledged that a reduced-price paper version would never be released.  The publishing house insists that all pledges are honored, as the free-of-charge version is web-based, and not a paper encyclopedia. Gyldendal's vision is to create a hybrid between the traditional encyclopedia and user-generated encyclopedias like Wikipedia. While registered users may contribute with content and upload images, etc., a professional editorial staff maintain oversight over contributions. The status of an article is clearly flagged, if it is user-generated content or if it has been approved by the editorial staff.  The vision is that the online version will be the Dane's preferred choice for updated and trustworthy information, maintaining the status of a traditional encyclopedia.  Gyldendal sought to recruit about 1,500 subject matter experts to verify user contributions to the about 161,000 articles - by March 2009 about 1,100 experts had been enrolled.

        "content": "The magazine was started in 1913 with the name La Science et la Vie. In 1982, a spinoff computer magazine, Science & Vie Micro (SVM) was launched. The first magazine was published at the end of 1983 and was such a success that the number of copies were insufficient on the market. Another spinoff for teenagers, Science & Vie Junior was started in 1986. It was first published by Excelsior Publications until the latter was bought by Emap Plc in 2003. In June 2006 the magazine became part of Mondadori France. In July 2019, the magazine was sold to Reworld Media. Science & Vie was divided in three sections, Science (Sciences), Technologie (Technology), Vie Pratique (Daily life). While the Science section reported on recent scientific progress, the Technology section would report on recent technical advances. Science & Vie covered technical advances in industry, but also in military technology. In particular, it featured articles on explosives, firearms, chemical weapons and nuclear weapons. The Vie Pratique section was concerned with technology in daily life. It included articles on photography, personal computers, video recording equipment or television. Besides these three sections, Science & Vie contained a section on amateur electronics by Henri-Pierre Penel, a section on amateur astronomy La Calculette de l'Astronome, and two sections on computer programming in BASIC, one on video games (first for the Sinclair ZX 81, and then the ZX Spectrum) and another of elementary numerical analysis, Le Micro de l'Ing\u00e9nieur (with listings for the Apple II). This made Science & Vie a more popular magazine (both in terms of circulation and in terms of the level of education of its readers) than La Recherche or Pour la Science which are only concerned with science, or Industries & Techniques which only deals with applications of technology in industry. Another important distinctive feature of Science & Vie was its willingness to tackle the issue of pseudoscience. The magazine was very critical of astrology, homeopathy, and pseudoscience. With the help of magician G\u00e9rard Majax, it has exposed the tricks used by Uri Geller to bend spoons and make small objects fly. In 1989, it strongly criticized the claims of Jacques Benveniste of having observed water memory. The magazine also uncovered the fabrication of the autopsy of an alien body supposedly discovered in Roswell, New Mexico. The magazine was also very supportive of Henri Broch's debunking of paranormal claims. In general, articles on paranormal topics were marked as Blurgs, an acronym for Balivernes lamentables \u00e0 l'usage r\u00e9serv\u00e9 des gogos (\"deplorable nonsense reserved for use by the gullible\"). Since being bought by Mondadori, the magazine has adopted a less skeptical line. In 2004 Science & Vie sold 361,273 copies. In 2010 the circulation of the magazine was 281,000 copies."

Cinquetti later returned to perform at the contest in , when she finished second with \"S\u00ec\", behind ABBA's \"Waterloo\". In , she co-hosted the contest in Rome alongside Toto Cutugno. Cinquetti was proved not to be a UK 'one-hit-wonder' when an English recording of her 1974 Eurovision entry (titled \"Go\") reached #8 in the UK chart."

Cherish's first single, \"Miss P\", was produced by Jermaine Dupri, written by Kandi and featured Da Brat. They had been signed to the Warner Bros.' imprint Reprise Records. After the success of their collaboration with Da Brat, the single was expected to be a hit. However, it failed to chart on any major charts in the US or elsewhere. It did, however, have minor success on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the United States, where it peaked at number 87. Other than a performance of the song on Soul Train in May 2003, the album received little promotion, which can be attributed to its commercial failure. Due to the commercial failure of its lead single, the girls' first album, The Moment, was shelved a few months later. The group then recorded three songs for The Powerpuff Girls: Power Pop soundtrack, called \"Chemical X\", \"Power of a Female\" and \"Me and My Girls\". A music video for \"Power of the Female\" was released as a promotional single on Cartoon Network in mid-2003. In 2005, the girls began work on another album. They wrote almost the entire album and said this work was so much more mature and themselves than their unreleased previous work. The album was produced by Jermaine Dupri, Don Vito and Jazze Pha. On March 21, 2006, Cherish released their first single in three years, titled \"Do It to It\". The single featured Sean P on guest vocals. The single met with a positive critical reception, as well as a strong commercial reception. The single was met with a large amount of success in the US, charting on several Billboard charts. The single became their first to reach the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, when it peaked at number 12. The single was also a success on the Pop 100 chart, where it peaked at number 9, as well as the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, reaching a peak of number 10.

During an interview about the album, when asked about its composition, the group said, \"You can expect a lot of realness, [and] we're trying to bring real R&B back to the world. Right now, R&B is not a genre anymore. It's pop, it's [hip-hop], it's other things. I wanna bring back rhythm and blues.\" In another interview, the girls talked about how different this album was from their shelved debut. \"Well it\u2019s very different coming out now because with this album we have more creative control. When we came out in 2003, we were young and we didn\u2019t have much of a say in what went down. But this time around, we were able to write every song on the album, which makes this album very personal for all of us.\" They later added, \"From this album you can expect realness. Expect to hear all of our individual voices. A lot of crunk tracks like our first single \u201cDo It To It\u201d. Also expect a lot of a cappella singing.\" The first track on the album, \"That Boi\", is an up tempo hip hop song that speaks of a boy who is driving the protagonist insane because she wants him so much. The song was intended to be released as a single. However, due to the merger of Capitol Records and Virgin Records, all single plans were canceled. \"Do It to It\" is the second song on the album, as well as the lead single. An uptempo dance track, the song was received positively by critics. It was also commercially successful, peaking inside the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The third song is \"Chevy\", and is yet another up tempo song with an R&B tint. The song speaks of the protagonist wanting to be \"treated like a Chevy\", stating \"you can show me off\". Some of the lyrics have been seen as sexual. The fourth song on the album is \"Unappreciated\", which was the second single. The R&B ballad had a somewhat successful commercial performance, peaking inside the top 40 in Japan, as well as peaking at 41 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their second to enter the chart. The fifth song is \"Taken\", an upbeat track that speaks of meeting someone at a club who treats them well and hooks up with them, even though they are taken. \"Stop Calling Me\" is the sixth track on the album, and is more slower paced than other tracks. It speaks of the protagonist who is trying to end the relationship, but her partner keeps calling, and will not give up on them. \"Oooh\" is the seventh song on the album, and is a more R&B tinted song. It speaks of the protagonist imagining all of the things she could do with her lover, but she is unsure if she is ready. The eighth song on the album is \"Chick Like Me\". The track features Rasheeda on guest vocals, and speaks about how boys want a \"chick like me\". \"Whenever\", the R&B ballad, is the ninth song on the album. It speaks of being there for a significant other when they need you the most. The tenth song on the album is \"Show & Tell\". The mid-tempo track was meant to be a future single, along with \"That Boi\". However, due to the merger between Capitol Records and Virgin Records, all future singles were canceled, leaving the track unreleased. \"Fool 4 You\" is a soft R&B track that speaks of the protagonist not being able to get over her past relationship. The last song on the album is the ballad \"Moment In Time\". It speaks of a couple who is on the verge of breaking up. The protagonist speaks of how she cannot go on without him."

The single was met with positive critical reception, as well as a strong commercial reception. It had a large amount of success in the US, charting on several Billboard charts. The single became their first to reach the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, when it peaked at number 12. The single was also success on the Pop 100 chart, where it peaked at number 9, as well as the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, reaching a peak of number 10 on that chart. The single also was a major hit in New Zealand, peaking at number 3 on the official singles chart. It also reached the top 10 in Japan, reaching a peak of number 10 on the chart. The song also climbed to the top 40 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, peaking at number 30 and 34 respectively. The song also charted in countries such as Australia, peaking at number 67, Germany, peaking at number 87, and France, reaching a peak of number 48. The second official single was \"Unappreciated\", which is also the album's title track. The ballad was met with far less commercial success than its predecessor. It was, however, a top 40 hit in Japan. In the US, the song barely missed out on the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 41. It did, however, become their second top 20 hit on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at number 14. In the United Kingdom, the single debuted and peaked at number 187. The third single was to be \"Chevy\", but the merger of Capitol and Virgin Records prevented the release of not only Cherish's, but Chingy's, LeToya's, and Janet Jackson's third single, causing the song to be released for promo only. \"That Boi\" and \"Show & Tell\" were scheduled to be released as a single but they never were released due to the merge. However, they were aired on some radio stations in the U.S."

The group performed their single, Do It to It on BET's 106 & Park & during the pre-show at the BET Awards 2006, and again on August 1, 2006 on ABC's Live with Regis & Kelly, and once more during BET's 106 & Party New Year's Eve special to introduce 2007. The group also made a special appearance on ABC's Good Morning America to introduce the snap dance and on August 15, 2006, the group made a live appearance on MTV's TRL to promote the release of their album. And in late November 2006, the group performed their single Unappreciated on BET's 106 & Park, which sparked rumors that Bow Wow & Cherish had some sort of altercation during the live taping. The group also embarked on their own mini-tour to promote the album, with shows at venues such as Six Flags and Orlando Studios. During this time Cherish was the only female group on select dates, as the opening act for Chris Brown's 'Up Close & Personal Tour', along with Ne-Yo, Lil Wayne, Julez Santana & Dem Franchize Boyz, which ran from August to October. Cherish ended up canceling a handful of their live shows, mainly their Californian concerts, due to rumors saying the group is very unorganized; it is stated that Neosha is the only member in the group who is organized and Farrah's son Jayden being sick, which caused the group to either cancel shows or shorten their live set with Farrah being absent. However, Cherish then went on a European promotional tour in November, and finished up the year with a few Jingle Jam shows in December."

        "content": "Mark Edwards Nero, of about.com praised the album, stating, \"They might not exactly be the new Destiny's Child, but the four members of Cherish definitely show a lot of promise on their debut album. Fans of snap music, pop-R&B and/or dance club jams should be happy with the upbeat, youthful exuberance displayed throughout Unappreciated.\" Nero praised the album for its \"youthful energy\", as well as its \"soulful bounce\". He also commented that he enjoyed the \"mature, meaningful lyrics\". However, Nero did criticize \"the girls' shallow vocal range\" as well as the \"lack of distinction between the girls' voices\". A reviewer for \"somekindaoh\" commented on the album, stating, \"Cherish may not be the 2nd coming of any infamous girl group from the past but this actually works in their favor. The lack of pressure from comparisons will give them ample room to breathe and time to live up to the potential exhibited on this debut. They already know how to write a good lyric and construct a good melody. And once they learn the art of arranging a good vocal is to make it the heart of the song rather than just simply a element in it, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll find themselves appreciated on a much larger scale.\" Andy Kellman of AllMusic gave the album a mixed review, stating, \"Though they're still in their late teens and early twenties, they write a lot of their lyrics, and they sound as sure of themselves on Unappreciated as any R&B group with a handful of albums behind them. However, it's clear that they're very much under the influence of their inspirations and contemporaries (from Destiny's Child to Ciara) and aren't yet able to distinguish themselves from what they've absorbed as music fans. Unappreciated is a boilerplate R&B album that's pleasant and likeable, yet it doesn't leave much of an impression and lacks character. Lead single \"Do It to It\", produced by Don Vito and Cheese, is emblematic in that it's the best track on the album and bears a tremendous resemblance to Ciara's Jazze Pha-produced hits (all the way down to its cadence).\" Michael Endelman of Entertainment Weekly said of the album, \"This month's model is Cherish, a cheery female foursome that blends the rapid call-and-response vocals of Destiny's Child with the slithery club grooves of Ciara. The mix works, creating a debut that matches of-the-moment beats with sticky melodies. The best cut on Unappreciated is the Don Vito-produced single \"Do It to It,\" which gives the Southern micro-genre known as snap music (think D4L's Laffy Taffy) a Top 40 makeover with a slinky percolating beat and a sweetly cooing chorus.\" He ended the review by giving the album a \"B\" rating."

It reached #8 in the UK, and #29 in Canada. The album itself was released on 27 September 1968, and failed to make the UK album charts. The band planned to release a fourth single from the album - \"Technicolour Dreams\" backed with the Wilde/Scott composition \"Paradise Flat\" - but this was withdrawn after a few days in favour of a non-album single release early the following year. The new single, Rossi and Parfitt's \"Make Me Stay a Bit Longer\", with bassist Alan Lancaster's \"Auntie Nellie\" as the b-side, was released on 31 January 1969. As well as getting the \"thumbs up\" from a majority of the record reviewers, this single was also something of a landmark for the group, as it would be their final release to credit them as \"the\" Status Quo."

His mother, Julia, did not live with her son, although they had a good relationship; she was hit and killed in a car accident on 15 July 1958 by an off-duty policeman named Eric Clague, when Lennon was 17. In one of his last concerts, Lennon stated that the song was not just about his parents, but was rather \"about 99% of the parents, alive or half dead\". \"Mother\" opens the album, starting with a funeral bell tolling slowly, four times. The song ends with Lennon repeating the phrase \"Mama don't go, daddy come home\", each time increasing in intensity until he screams the line as the song fades out. Lennon was inspired to write the song after undergoing primal therapy with Arthur Janov, originally at his home at Tittenhurst Park and then at the Primal Institute, California, where he remained for four months. Lennon, who eventually derided Janov, initially described the therapy as \"something more important to me than The Beatles\". Although Lennon said that \"Mother\" was the song that \"seemed to catch in my head,\" he had doubts about its commercial appeal and he considered issuing \"Love\" as a single instead. In November 1982, a remixed version of \"Love\" was released as a single to help promote The John Lennon Collection LP. An early version of \"Mother\" performed on an electric guitar by Lennon can be heard on the John Lennon Anthology box set. A demo version of the song was featured in the final scene and credits of the 2009 John Lennon biographical film, Nowhere Boy."

It was originally set to a Dutch folk tune. In the United States, it is popularly associated with Thanksgiving Day and is often sung at family meals and at religious services on that day."

        "content": "At the time the hymn was written, the Dutch were engaged in a war of national liberation against the Catholic King Philip II of Spain.  \"Wilt heden nu treden,\" \"We gather together\" resonated because under the Spanish King, Dutch Protestants were forbidden to gather for worship.  The hymn first appeared in print in a 1626 collection of Dutch folk and patriotic songs, Nederlandtsche Gedenck-Clanck by Adriaen Valerius. In anglophone hymnology, the tune is known as \"Kremser\", from Eduard Kremser's 1877 score arrangement and lyric translation of Wilt Heden Nu Treden into Latin and German. The modern English text was written by Theodore Baker in 1894. According to the Hymn Society in the United States and Canada, \"We Gather Together's\" first appearance in an American hymnal was in 1903. It had retained popularity among the Dutch, and when the Dutch Reformed Church in North America decided in 1937 to abandon the policy that they had brought with them to the New World in the 17th century of singing only psalms and add hymns to the church service,  \"We Gather Together\" was chosen as the first hymn in the first hymnal. A different translation under the first line We Praise Thee, O God, Our Redeemer, Creator was translated by J.B.C. Cory (1882-1963). The hymn steadily gained popularity, especially in services of Thanksgiving on such occasions as town and college centennial celebrations.   According to Carl Daw, executive director of the Hymn Society, the \"big break\" came in 1935 when it was included in the national hymnal of the Methodist-Episcopal Church. According to Michael Hawn, professor of sacred music at Southern Methodist University's Perkins School of Theology, \"by World War I, we started to see ourselves in this hymn,\" and the popularity increased during World War II, when \"the wicked oppressing\" were understood to include Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. This hymn is often sung at American churches the Sunday before Thanksgiving. This hymn was sung at the Opening of the Funeral Mass for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The West Wing episode \"Shibboleth\" (season 2, episode 8 \"Shibboleth\") alluded to the hymn, and it was played in the episode's final scene (performed by the Cedarmont Kids.) The hymn is also usually sung by the Quartermaine family on the American soap opera General Hospital's annual Thanksgiving episode."

        "content": "The band began experimenting with a new sound when they hired Australian singer-songwriter Carl Groszmann to write a song for them. That song became \"Down the Dustpipe\", released as a non-album single in March 1970, with the Francis Rossi/Rick Parfitt song \"Face Without a Soul\" \u2013 from the band's previous album Spare Parts \u2013 as its B-side. The song, remarked Rossi, \u201cwas the [first] to feature our soon-to-be trademark boogie shuffle\u201d and became one of the most popular numbers in their live set. The single took the media by surprise as it was so different in sound from their previous work. BBC Radio 1 presenter Tony Blackburn dismissed it on-air the first time he played it with the comment, \"Down the dustbin for this one.\" Nevertheless, it was an instant hit, reaching #12 in the UK and remaining in the top 50 for a 17 weeks. October 1970 saw the release of another non-album single: the Rossi/Young composition \"In My Chair\", with the non-album B-side \"Gerdundula\" (written while in Germany by Rossi and Young under the pseudonyms Manston and James, with a title reportedly inspired by their German friends Gerd and Ula). It earned the band another hit, reaching #21. 'Gerdundula' would be rerecorded for their next album, Dog of Two Head. While on tour the same year, organist Roy Lynes fell in love. He could see how serious the other members were about fame and glory, yet wanted to settle down with his newfound love. According to the group's producer, John Schroeder, who wrote the booklet notes for the 3-CD compilation The Early Years, Lynes was \"the quietest member of the group\" and \"somehow always seemed to be the odd one out\". Parfitt has said Lynes was \"a bit laid back, the Open University type who liked tinkering and finding out about things\", and Rossi remarked that, when Lynes showed up at a gig in New Zealand about ten years later to say hello, \"he seemed a much happier bloke.\" \"Just so right and so tight,\" observed Pavement's Stephen Malkmus of Ma Kelly's Greasy Spoon. \"As with Dog of Two Head from the year after, this record is transitional: it's the man-steps towards their interchangeable album phase of pure-denim-heads-down-choogle, and never gets boring. Smooth voices over solid grooves. If it was a place, I wish I was there.\""

Rudy is in the middle of reading the story to the reader when Foma interrupts and demands to tell it his way.  His grandfather used to live in an old village not far from Dikanka that no longer exists. There lived a Cossack named Korzh, his daughter Pidorka, and his worker Petro.  Petro and Pidorka fall in love. One day, Korzh catches Pidorka and Petro kissing and is about to whip Petro, but he stops when his son Ivas pleads for his father not to beat the worker.  Korzh instead takes Petro outside and tells him to never come to his home again, and the lovers are distraught. Petro is willing to do anything to see Pidorka again, so he meets with Basavriuk, a stranger who frequents the village tavern and who is believed by the villagers to be the devil himself. Basavriuk tells Petro to meet him in Bear\u2019s Ravine in order to obtain the treasure that will allow him to reunite with Pidorka. When Petro arrives at the location, he is instructed to find and pluck a fern that blooms on Kupala Night.  When Petro picks the flower, a witch appears and hands him a spade. Petro digs up the treasure, but he cannot open it until blood has been shed. He is prepared to use his own blood but is presented with Ivas who has been captured. Petro is initially reluctant, but overcome by uncertainty, he decapitates the child and obtains the gold. He then immediately falls asleep for two days, and when he awakens, he sees the gold but cannot remember where it came from. Petro appeases Korzh with the gold, and he marries Pidorka. After they are married, Petro becomes increasingly distant and insane, constantly obsessing over what he has forgotten. As a last resort, Pidorka is convinced to visit the witch for help, and she brings her to their home. Upon seeing the witch, Petro regains his memory of the night and hurls an axe at the witch, who disappears. Ivas appears at the door covered in blood, and Petro is carried away by the devil. All that remains is a pile of ashes where he once stood, and the gold has turned into pieces of broken pottery. After this, Basavriuk begins to appear in the village again and Pidorka goes on a pilgrimage. Foma\u2019s grandfather\u2019s aunt still had problems with the devil however; a party is ruined when a roast lamb comes alive, a chalice bows to his grandfather, and a bowl begins to dance. Even after sprinkling the entire area with holy water the tavern remains possessed, so the village becomes abandoned."

        "content": "The story takes place in a Ukrainian village; as such, Gogol uses gastronomy to portray Ukrainian customs, including during the wedding of Petro and Pidorka, the narrator's prayer for his grandfather, and the description of the witch's face (\"like a baked apple\"). St. John's Eve further reflects Ukrainian traditions in the complicated wedding rites described in the story. The temporal setting is the holiday season, which plays a role in the plot of the story. The story is considered a Kunstmarchen, a fairy tale that is based in reality or folk tale told by a subjective narrator. Foma Grigorievich, the narrator, describes his grandfather's stories as themselves magically efficacious. In St. John's Eve, as in Gogol's other stories, the laws of nature are often broken; for instance, the devil's gifts float in water. The genre of the story, much like the characterization of the devil character Basavriuk, is initially romantic comedy and ends as \"romantic horror.\""

Mussorgsky had abandoned an earlier project, an opera based on the short story. Nikolai Gogol's work has been compared to that of Oscar Wilde; the beheading of Ivas parallels the murder by Savile in Lord Arthur Savile's Crime''. In both stories, the sacrifice of the blood of an innocent is a prerequisite for marriage."

The magazine was established in 1990, following the invasion of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), and continued publishing up to the genocide. Sponsored by the dominant MRND party and edited by founder Hassan Ngeze, the magazine was a response to the RPF-sponsored Kanguka, adopting a similar informal style.  \"Kangura\" was a Rwandan word meaning \"wake others up\", as opposed to \"Kanguka\", which meant \"wake up\".  The journal was based in Gisenyi. The magazine was the print equivalent to the later-established Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM), publishing articles harshly critical of the RPF and of Tutsis generally.  Its sensationalist news was passed by word-of-mouth through the largely illiterate population. Copies of Kangura were read in public meetings and, as the genocide approached, during Interahamwe militia rallies."

        "content": "The journal was financed by military officers, MRND members and an intelligence agency of the government.  Supporters included Lt.-Col. Anatole Nsengiyumva and Protais Zigiranyirazo, both later charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  Two language editions were published twice a month in batches of 1,500 to 3,000 copies.  Some of the early editions were published on government printing presses.  Due to the magazine's close ties with the government, it came to be viewed as a vehicle for the government of President Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana to test ideas, though Kangura did not hesitate to criticize the president over perceived concessions made during the negotiations in Arusha with the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). Kangura criticised democracy as sowing discord between Hutu and called for rallying around the MRND. Kangura was key in fomenting extremism and, in turn, became the mouthpiece of the CDR upon its founding in February 1992.  The CDR was an extremist offshoot of the MRND that campaigned for a \"pure Hutu\" nation and prohibited Rwandans with Tutsi grandparents from joining.  While initially formed to give the MRND and Habyarimana deniability for the positions espoused, the CDR soon developed a life of its own.  Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, the Force Commander of UNAMIR, the United Nations peacekeeping force, would later refer to Kangura as \"their [the CDR's] propaganda rag\" and a \"scurrilous extremist newspaper\". The extensive connections of Kangura to the ruling elite appeared to give the magazine inside knowledge.  \"People who might otherwise have ignored [the magazine] paid attention, because Kangura seemed to know what was going to happen before it did,\" stated Kenyan journalist Mary Kimani."

        "content": "An article in the sixth issue, published December 1990, was the first publication of the \"Hutu Ten Commandments\", which decreed that Hutus who interacted with Tutsis were traitors. The propaganda of Kangura targeted women in particular, accusing Tutsi women of seducing Hutu in order to spy on them and mollify them, but only bearing the children of other Tutsi. Another article of December 1990 claimed that the Tutsi were prepared for a war. The back of issue six was a picture of French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand with the caption, \"It is during hard times that one comes to know one's true friends.\" An editorial in the 9 February 1991 issue stated: \"Let us learn about the inkotanyi [RPF supporters] and let us exterminate every last one of them\".  In a November 1991 edition, Ngeze asked \"What tools will we use to defeat the Inyenzi once and for all?\" alongside an image of a machete. The March 1993 issue advised, \"A cockroach gives birth to a cockroach... the history of Rwanda shows us clearly that a Tutsi always stays exactly the same, that he has never changed.\" Kangura further asserted that some who said they were Hutus were in fact Tutsis and that these individuals could be recognized because they \"lacked commitment to the Hutu cause\" and that the RPF had launched its 1990 invasion in order to reestablish the Tutsi monarchy and enslave the Hutus. The writings of founder Ngeze in the journal regularly hinted at exterminations.  In issue 54, of March 1994, Ngeze stated that the RPF had a list of 1600 people who they would kill if they ever took power and warned \"the accomplices of the enemy are well known.  Therefore the Inyenzi should have the courage to understand that they are making a slight error, they shall be exterminated.\" Kangura also implied threats against Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana, especially after its funders moved from the MRND to the CDR.  The December 1993 issue stated that a Hutu soldier enraged by the Arusha Accords would soon assassinate the president.  The January 1994 issue predicted that Habyarimana would be killed in March."

This sparked the genocide. Over 800,000 people were killed, mostly Tutsis but including Hutu moderates  who attempted to protect Tutsi from the militias. Hassan Ngeze, the founder, editor and accountant for Kangura fled the country as the RPF took control.  He was arrested in 1997 and charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for his involvement with Kangura, as well as for his supervision of massacres in his home province of Gisenyi.  His trial, grouped with that of RTLM co-founders Ferdinand Nahimana and Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, was the first to establish that media organizations could be held responsible for inciting genocide since the 1946 conviction of Nazi publisher Julius Streicher.  In 2003, Ngeze was sentenced to life imprisonment; Nahimana and Barayagwiza were also convicted."

The rewritten version met with her approval and has become something of a fan favourite. The song itself deals with the need to overcome the prejudices of skin colour. Ursull sings, \"when someone talks to me about skin colour / I have the blues which sends shivers down my spine / I feel as if I'm in a tale by Edgar Allan Poe\". That said, she does not believe in relinquishing her connection to Africa entirely (\"Africa, my love, I have you in my skin\"), but admits that she faces difficulties in a white society (\"we, the blacks / we're a few millions, a dime a dozen\"). Musically, the song features an accordion as well as the synthesiser effects starting to appear at the contest in the early 1990s. The song is in triple metre, with the verses following an unusual phrasing of seven triplets per phrase,  and the chorus with a more conventional eight triplets per phrase.

The release of Family's similarly titled debut then prompted them to adopt the minimalist title The Beatles for what is now commonly referred to as the \"White Album\" due to its plain white sleeve. \"Old Songs, New Songs\" features a cameo from the Tubby Hayes group, arranged by 18-year-old Mike Batt. Hayes played the tenor sax solo at the end of the track (uncredited). Batt also arranged and conducted other strings and brass for the album, notably \"The Chase\" and \"Mellowing Grey\" but was not credited. The album was the first of its kind by an English rock group on the US Reprise label set up for Frank Sinatra (but was already part of Warner Bros). It was licensed to the label by Dukeslodge Enterprises, a company run by the band's manager, John Gilbert, who was credited as 'executive producer' of the album. The album was released on vinyl in mono (RLP6312) and stereo (RSLP6312), and also Stereo 8 Track Cartridge. Mono vinyl copies featured a different mix to the stereo pressing and many mono copies were returned to the shops as they often skipped tracks. The mono edition was swiftly withdrawn, making this a much sought-after format. This album was initially issued in the US using the UK import and sold in the US as a domestic album with an extra piece of cardboard to stiffen the sleeve (as they essentially had the same catalog number in both countries).  Around the time the second album was issued in the US, US pressings of this album started to appear.  (The album also initially had a 12\" black and white photo of group included as an insert.) In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, the album ranked number 30 in its list of \"40 Cosmic Rock Albums\".

The collection came to completion during Gogol\u2019s ill-fated term as Professor of Medieval History at the University of St. Petersburg in 1834. This period was very productive for Gogol, as he also worked on The Government Inspector and Dead Souls. Neglecting his duties as professor, Gogol wrote to his friend Mikhail Maximovich of his writing, confiding, \u201cI am working like a horse, but on my own things and not on my lectures.\u201d The two epigraphs that Gogol attaches to Mirgorod reveal his intention to present the stories as a cycle: \u201cMirgorod is an extremely small town near the Khorol river. It has one rope factory, one brick works, four water mills and forty five windmills\u201d and \u201cAlthough in Mirgorod bread rings are baked from black dough, they are very tasty,\u201d ostensibly taken from works entitled Zyablovsky\u2019s Geography and Notes of a Traveler respectively. Gogol conceived of the stories as circular like a Mirgorod bread ring, and endeavored to exhaustively display in them the panorama of traditional Ukrainian provincial life. \u201cThe Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich\u201d met with disapproval from censors, leading Gogol to pen a preface to the story with thinly veiled contempt for censorship. The preface, however, was also rejected during printing. As a result, Gogol was forced to hastily add two superfluous pages to \u201cViy\u201d so that the finished bindings of the first edition would still fit."

        "content": "Before Le Marteau, Boulez had established a reputation as the composer of modernist and serialist works such as Structures I, Polyphonie X, as well as his infamously \"unplayable\" Second Piano Sonata. Le Marteau was first written as a six-movement composition between 1953 and 1954, and was published in that form in the latter year, \"imprim\u00e9e pour le festival de musique, 1954, Donaueschingen\" (though in the end it was not performed there) in a photographic reproduction of the composer's manuscript by Universal Edition, given the catalog number UE 12362. In 1955 Boulez revised the order of these movements and interpolated three newly composed ones. The original, six-movement form lacked the two \"Bel \u00c9difice\" settings and the third commentaire on \"Bourreaux de solitude\". In addition, the movements were grouped in two closed cycles: first the three \"Artisanat furieux\" movements, then the three \"Bourreaux de solitude\" ones, otherwise in the order of the final score. The first movement, though fundamentally the same composition, was originally scored as a duet for vibraphone and guitar\u2014the flute and viola were added only in the revision\u2014and numerous less significant alterations were made to playing techniques and notation in the other movements. It received its premi\u00e8re in 1955 at the 29th Festival of the International Society for Contemporary Music in Baden-Baden. Boulez's work was chosen to represent France at this festival. The French members of the committee were against this, but Heinrich Strobel, then director of the Baden-Baden S\u00fcdwestfunk Orchestra, which was scheduled to give all of the concerts at the festival, threatened to withdraw the orchestra if the work was not accepted. The first performance was given on 18 June 1955 conducted by Hans Rosbaud, with Sybilla Plate as the solo singer. Boulez, notorious for considering his works to be always \"in progress\", made further, smaller revisions to Le Marteau in 1957, in which year Universal Edition issued an engraved score, UE 12450. In the years that have followed, it has become Pierre Boulez's most famous and influential work."

This is partially due to the fact that Boulez believes in strict control tempered with \"local indiscipline\", or rather, the freedom to choose small, individual elements while still adhering to an overall structure compatible with serialist principles. Boulez opts to change individual notes based on sound or harmony, choosing to abandon adherence to the structure dictated by strict serialism, making the detailed serial organization of the piece difficult for the listener to discern."

The xylorimba recalls the African balafon; the vibraphone, the Balinese gamelan; and the guitar, the Japanese koto, though \"neither the style nor the actual use of these instruments has any connection with these different musical civilizations\". Boulez chose the collection with a continuum of sonorities in mind: \"a number of features shared by these instruments (forms) a continuous passage from voice to vibraphone\". The purpose is to allow a graduated deconstruction of the voice into percussive noises, a compositional technique which has been common throughout Boulez's work (e.g. Sur Incises of 1998 similarly breaks down the sounds of the piano by combining it with harp and percussion). The voice and five pitched instruments can be arranged in a line, each pair connected by a similarity, as in the following diagram: The vocal writing is challenging for the singer, containing wide leaps, glissandi, humming (notated bouche ferm\u00e9e in the score), and even Sprechstimme, a device found in the work of the Second Viennese School before Boulez. There are also deliberate similarities to Arnold Schoenberg's song cycle, Pierrot Lunaire, one of which is that each movement chooses a different subset of the available instruments: The opening of the third movement in the flute is typical of the difficulties required of performers including wide range, large leaps, and complex rhythms:"

        "content": "Using these 25 groups in conjunction with pitch multiplication, Boulez is able to create 25 \"harmonic fields\" within each set. Koblyakov in his analysis assigns a letter to each cluster within a set, such that two sets multiplied together can be notated as \"aa\", \"bc\", \"ed\", etc. Boulez's form of pitch multiplication can be thought of more as pitch addition. With this technique, Boulez takes two clusters and takes the sum of every possible pairing between the two clusters. For example, if we were to multiply groups b and c within set I, we would have the following: (2 1 10 11) + (9 0) = ((2+9) (1+9) (10+9) (11+9) (2+0) (1+0) (10+0) (11+0)) = (11 10 7 8 2 1 10 11) Boulez then eliminates any duplicate pitches, which in this case would leave us with the set . In fact, this is the set of notes we get in measure three of movement III, \"L'Artisanat furieux.\" This movement, scored only for flute and voice, lays out pitch multiplication in a more straightforward way than movements I and VII. For the first 11 measures, Boulez (mostly) sticks to one pitch multiplication set per measure. Later, Boulez begins to use multiple pitch fields at a time, further complicating the analysis. Koblyakov's analysis reveals that the harmonic fields Boulez employs at certain parts of the piece are laid out very systematically, showing that the movements' overall forms are complexly mathematical as well."

        "content": "The second cycle consists of movements II, IV, VI, and VIII. Through these movements, especially movement VI, Boulez uses a technique called \"pitch-duration association\" by Steven Winick. This technique associates individual pitches with individual durations, for example, C = sixteenth note, C = eighth note, D = dotted-eighth note, so that as the pitch increases by half step the associated duration increases by an added sixteenth note. Winick calls this a pitch-duration association or PDA based on C. In movement VI, these PDAs are most easily observed, with the first twelve notes of the piece forming a PDA on D. The next twelve notes also fall neatly into a PDA on G, though Boulez occasionally swaps the durations of a couple pitches throughout this system, reflecting his interest in \"local indiscipline.\" Another way in which Boulez confuses the analysis of this cycle is by placing some rhythms under triplet markings. After the voice enters in measure 13 of the movement, matters become even more complicated as Boulez employs all 12 possible PDAs simultaneously throughout the rest of the movement. As with the first cycle, Boulez's overall formal structure is quite complex and shows many patterns. Arrangements in pitch order throughout these PDAs reveals many symmetrical and palindromic arrangements, which are further explored both in Winick's and Koblyakov's analyses. In addition to coordinating durations with certain pitches, Boulez assigns dynamics and attacks to pitches in a similar manner. Using the opening PDA on D as an example, Boulez arranges the pitches chromatically and then groups them into 6 pairs (D and D, E and F, F and G, etc.), assigning a dynamic from pianissimo to fortissimo to each pair. In addition, the first note within a pair receives an attack of some sort\u2014legato for piano and pianissimo, accent for mezzo forte and mezzo piano, and sforzando for forte and fortissimo. However, while these dynamic and attack associations are consistent enough to be unmistakably deliberate, Boulez returns again to the idea of \"local indiscipline\". Wentzel found that Boulez's association of pitches, dynamics, durations, and attacks agrees with his analysis 80% of the time. A number of these discrepancies are accounted for by differences among the printed and manuscript sources, but it is impossible to say whether any are deliberate compositional decisions."

        "content": "The third cycle consists only of movements V and IX, making it the shortest of the three cycles. However, both of these movements play essential roles in the piece, especially when one takes into account the extreme levels of symmetry and pattern employed by Boulez in his composition of the work. Movement V occupies the central position in Le marteau, and the movement itself may be broken up into six sections. Boulez designates these sections in his tempo markings and orchestrations\u2014the three odd-numbered sections are written only for instruments and marked assez vif, while the three even-numbered sections are scored for voice and instruments and marked plus large. An interesting characteristic of Boulez's orchestrating during the even sections is that the voice and instruments seem to be in opposition, with the instruments playing similar rhythms and dynamics (or at least more similar than between the instruments and the voice). In the sections where the voice is not present, the writing for the instruments is more contrapuntal. Movement V also uses Sprechgesang while vocal parts in the other cycles do not. Movement IX is broken up into three large sections, with the third being broken up further into a number of smaller fragments. The first large section includes variations of quotations from the central movements of all three cycles (movements III, V, and VI) along with the text from movement 5. The movements are quoted in reverse order (i.e. VI, V, III), and each time the text from the quoted movement is combined in some way with the text from movement III. The second large section, also the main section of the movement, includes a voice part without text and is built on a similar set of PDAs as the second cycle of Marteau while also drawing on movement V. The harmony for this section is interesting in that Boulez entirely avoids minor seconds as well as minor thirds (though their inverse, major sixths, are used instead). Unisons are used very rarely. The third section of movement IX serves as both a coda to the movement and to the piece. It is scored only for flute and percussion. Another interesting characteristic of movement IX is that all of its tempos are drawn from previous movements. Tempo shifts also almost always increase by a ratio of 1.2 or 1.5."

        "content": "Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre was hailed by critics, fellow composers, and other musical experts as a masterpiece of the post-war avant-garde from its first performance in 1955. Interviewed in 2014, the composer Harrison Birtwistle declared that Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre \"is the kind of piece, in all the noise of contemporary music that's gone on in my lifetime, I'd like to have written\". Another British composer, George Benjamin, described the work as \"a breakthrough. It is a work in which you can also hear the profound influence of extra-European music, above all from Asia and Africa. This radically alters the sonority and the music's sense of time and direction, as well as its expressive viewpoint and ethos\". One of the most enthusiastic and influential early testimonials came from Igor Stravinsky, who praised the work as an exemplar of \"a new and wonderfully supple kind of music\". However, according to Howard Goodall, the sixty years since its premi\u00e8re have failed to grant Le marteau an equally enthusiastic endorsement from the general public. \"While Boulez's iconoclasm was attractive to some students of twentieth-century classical music, who venerated\u2026 Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre,\u2026 most neutral listeners then as now found both his polemic and his music thoroughly impenetrable\". Despite its attractive surface, its \"smooth sheen of pretty sounds\", issues remain about the music's deeper comprehensibility for the ordinary listener. Even Stravinsky's ear struggled to hear some of the work's polyphonic textures: \"One follows the line of only a single instrument and is content to be 'aware of' the others. Perhaps later the second line and the third will be familiar, but one mustn't try to hear them in the tonal-harmonic sense\". But if we are supposed not to listen in the tonal-harmonic sense, what exactly is it that we should hear and understand in a work which, in the words of Alex Ross, features \"nothing so vulgar as a melody or a steady beat\"? Stravinsky said that repeated hearings, through the availability of recordings, would aid performers more quickly to overcome technical difficulties presented by the music: \"If a work like Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre had been written before the present era of recording it would have reached young musicians outside of the principal cities only years later. As it is this same Marteau, considered so difficult to perform a few years ago, is now within the technique of many players, thanks to their being taught by record\". Writing some 40 years since Le Marteau first appeared, composer and music psychologist Fred Lerdahl criticized Koblyakov's approach to analyzing Le Marteau:  Lerdahl cautions, however, that \"There is no obvious relationship between the comprehensibility of a piece and its value\". While considering \"complicatedness to be a neutral value and complexity to be a positive one\", and therefore that only musical surfaces leading to complexity employ \"the full potential of our cognitive resources\", many kinds of music satisfy such criteria (e.g., Indian raga, Japanese koto, jazz, and most Western art music), while other types \"fall short\": Balinese gamelan because of its \"primitive pitch space\" and rock music on grounds of \"insufficient complexity\", while much contemporary music (without specific reference to Boulez) \"pursues complicatedness as compensation for a lack of complexity\". Roger Scruton finds Boulez's preoccupation with timbre and sonority in the instrumental writing has the effect of preventing \"simultaneities from coalescing as chords\". As a result, Scruton says that, especially where pitches are concerned, Le Marteau \"contains no recognizable material \u2013 no units of significance that can live outside the work that produces them\". Scruton also feels that the involved overlapping metres notated in the score beg \"a real question as to whether we hear the result as a rhythm at all\". Richard Taruskin found \"Le Marteau exemplified the lack of concern on the part of modernist composers for the comprehensibility of their music\". Equally bluntly, Christopher Small, writing in 1987 said \"It is not possible to invoke any 'inevitable time lag' which is supposed to be required for the assimilation of ...such critically acclaimed works as... Le marteau sans ma\u00eetre... Those who champion 'the new music' await its assimilation into the repertory much as the early Christians awaited the Second Coming\"."

Rockdelux'''s brief was to serve a specific section of the public who are passionate about music, and its focus was on new and more alternative artists from both Spain and the outside world (termed \"international\"). It had an extensive review section, covering mainly new musical releases and re-releases, but also covered other music-related subjects such as live concerts and videos and featured reviews of new books and graphic novels. Unlike many other review sections in popular magazines, it eschewed the trend of giving a numerical value to each review, which are purely composed of written text summing up the release's values. From 1987 Santi Carrillo was the editor-in-chief of the magazine. Rockdelux was the recipient of various awards for music publication of the year from such organisations as Radio 3, Cadena SER and Iberpop amongst others. In April 1999, Rockdelux'' began to issue complimentary CDs as a free gift with the magazine, each one generally acting as a sampler for a particular record label, such as Warp Records, Fierce Panda Records and Sub Pop records. The final issue (#394) was published in May 2020."

The surname is believed to be of Anglo-Saxon descent spreading to the Celtic countries of Ireland, Scotland and Wales in early times and is found in many mediaeval manuscripts throughout these countries In recent history, the Halls (Clan Hall) were one of the sixty major riding families of the Scottish Marches and were involved reiving as other border clans were. As with all Reiving families, they would consider themselves loyal to neither the English or the Scots, the family name holding allegiance over all else. See Border Reivers. In England the surname of Hall originates in 1090 AD when Lincolnshire nobleman Arthur FitzWilliam changed his name to Arthur Hall to distinguish himself from his older brother of the same name."

The complaint cited a column in which Palacio stated that Correa had permitted soldiers to fire on a hospital to suppress a violent police protest. A temporary magistrate who heard the case granted the president US$42 million in damages. The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court on 17 February 2012, but was suspended by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights four days later pending further review. The decision caused significant international criticism from newspapers, human rights groups, and press freedom organizations. An editorial in The New York Times described the verdict as \"a staggering, shameful blow to the country\u2019s democracy\", while Reporters Without Borders called it \"draconian\" and a \"grave legal precedent\". Correa, in contrast, described the verdict as a blow to the \"dictatorship\" of a corrupt press. On 27 February 2012, Correa pardoned the four defendants, stating that he had \"never wanted this trial\" but only wanted the public to know the truth. Later that year, the newspaper was awarded the inter-American Maria Moors Cabot prize. The citation read, \"Even in the face of Correa\u2019s bullying and the threat of incarceration, El Universo and many other Ecuadoran journalists have courageously defended their right and obligation to speak out for a democratic society.\""

The king's uncles were Prince Bi Gan, Prince Jizi, and Prince Weizi. Together the three princes were known as \"The Three Kind-Hearted Men of Shang\" in the kingdom. Prince Bi Gan was the son of King Wen Ding; he was the brother of King Zhou's father and, thus, was King Zhou's uncle, and served as the king's chancellor. Zhou was a cruel king, but his three uncles could not persuade him to change his ways. Failing in their duty to advise the king, Prince Weizi resigned. Prince Jizi faked insanity and was relieved of his post. Only Prince Bi Gan stayed on to continue advising the king to change his ways. \"Servants who are afraid of being killed and refrain from telling the truth are not righteous\" he said. This put him in danger of incurring the king's wrath. Prince Bi Gan stayed at the palace for three days and nights to try to persuade the blood-thirsty and immoral king to mend his ways. The stubborn king would not relent and had Prince Bi Gan arrested for treason. Upon hearing this, his pregnant wife escaped into the forest and went into labor there. With no one to help her, she gave birth to a boy in the rocky cave in the forest, in a placed called Chang Lin (\u9577\u6797). Before long, King Zhou was overthrown by King Wu of the Zhou dynasty. King Wu knew about the courageous royal court chancellor Prince Bi Gan and sought his wife and child. When he found them, he honoured them in respect of Prince Bi Gan. The mother and child were restored to the royal family. The new king conferred the surname Lin (meaning forest) and the Duchy of Bo'ling on Prince Bi Gan's son, named Lin (Lim/Lam) Jian (\u6797\u575a)."

The Hakka, Hokkien, Teochew and Hainan communities romanize it as \"Lim\" whereas the Cantonese-speaking community uses \"Lam\" or \"Lum\". The Korean surname Im ( in South Korean spelling;  in North Korean spelling; commonly romanized as Lim or Rim) is the Korean pronunciation of the same Chinese character (\u6797). A much less common Korean surname Im is derived from another character (; spelled  Im in both North and South Korean) the character used to write the surname Ren. In Korean, the former is called Supul Rim (\uc218\ud480 \ub9bc) and the latter Matgil Im (\ub9e1\uae38 \uc784) when they need to be distinguished. A common Japanese surname, Hayashi, is written with the same character \u6797 and also means forest. A much rarer Japanese surname, Rin, is also written with same character. The Vietnamese surname, \"L\u00e2m\", was formerly written using the same character. In Singapore, although \"Lim\" and \"Lam\" are generally more common variants, the extremely rare spelling \"Lyn\" can be found in select families of Chinese, Japanese, or other East Asian ancestry (also transcribed using the \u6797 character) and bears no known relation to the English or Scottish surname of the same spelling, or alternate spelling \"Ling\". A rare Chinese surname which is also transcribed Lin is \u85fa / \u853a (pinyin L\u00ecn), for example the Warring States period statesman Lin Xiangru . Indonesians of Chinese ancestry bearing this surname sometimes spell it as \"Liem\", pronounced from Fuqing dialect. Guamanians and Filipinos of Chinese descent with this surname mostly use the Hokkien spelling \"Lim\", as the majority have Fujianese ancestry. It is sometimes found in Hispanicised compound surnames such as \"Limjoco\" in the Philippines, and \"Limtiaco\" in Guam; this type of surname is often derived from the full and complete original name of a Spanish-era immigrant patriarch. Prominent Thai Chinese royalist families with this surname are bestowed by member of the royal family some indigenised derivative such as \"Limthongkul\" \"Sirilim\" \"Limpisthira.\" The character \"\u9716\" (L\u00edn, \"heavy rain showers\") is also a popular personal name among ethnic Chinese people."

        "content": "There are three camera styles available in The Witcher: two isometric perspectives, where the mouse is used to control most functions, and an over-the-shoulder view, which brings the player closer to the in-game combat while limiting vision. In all three views the controls can be changed to be primarily mouse focused or a combined keyboard and mouse approach. Players can choose one of three fighting styles to use in different situations and against different foes. The fast style allows for more rapid, less-damaging attacks with a higher chance of hitting faster enemies; the strong style deals more damage in exchange for a slow attack speed, and a lower chance to hit faster enemies; and the group style features sweeping attacks best used if Geralt is surrounded. The player can switch between the styles at any point. Both of Geralt's main swords also have distinctively different combat styles from other weaponry, and serve specific purposes. The steel blade is used to fight humans and other flesh-and-blood beings, while the silver sword is more effective against supernatural monsters and beasts (against some of which steel may have no effect whatsoever). With precise timing, the player can link Geralt's attacks into combos to damage enemies more effectively. Alchemy is a significant part of the gameplay. The player can create potions that increase health or endurance regeneration, allow Geralt to see in the dark, or provide other beneficial effects. The recipes for these potions can be learned through scrolls, or by experimentation. Once the player creates an unknown potion, he can choose to drink it, but if the potion is a failure it will poison or have other harmful effects on Geralt. Each time Geralt drinks potions, they increase the toxicity level of his body. This can be reduced by drinking a special potion or by meditating at an inn or fireplace. In addition to potions, the player can create oils used to augment the damage done by weapons. They can also create bombs for use as weapons in combat. Neither can be created until talent points have been allocated into the corresponding skills. A time-delayed decision-consequence system means that the repercussions of players' decisions will make themselves apparent in plot devices in later acts of the game. This helps avert a save-reload approach to decision making. It also adds to the game's replay value, as the consequences resulting from the player's decisions can lead to significant differences in the events that take place later, and ultimately a very different gameplay experience than in prior playthroughs. The player often finds themselves choosing between the lesser of two evils."

He is taken in by his Witcher brothers as well as Triss Merigold, who seeks a remedy for his mysterious condition. Kaer Morhen is suddenly attacked by an unknown group of assailants, who escape with the School of the Wolf's key mutagens and formulae that detail how to create Witchers. Pursuing this faction, Geralt travels to the Temerian capital Vizima. On the way, he saves Alvin, a magically gifted peasant child. Triss determines that Alvin is a Source, a genetic magic prodigy similar to Ciri, Geralt's foster daughter. The player has the choice of leaving Alvin in the care of either Triss or Shani, a Redanian medic and Geralt's friend. Alvin is given a magical amulet meant to keep his abilities in check while he learns magic. Geralt pursues several leads on the group that attacked Kaer Morhen and learns that they are known as Salamandra, and ostensibly led by the foreign mage Azar Javed. To further complicate matters, tensions are high in the city due to the conflict between the religious fanatics the Order of the Flaming Rose, and the elven terrorist faction the Scoia'tael. With the help of various allies in Vizima, Geralt assaults a Salamandra base in Vizima and kills the Professor, a dangerous mercenary in the employ of the criminal syndicate, but is then betrayed by Princess Adda and is teleported to a village on the outskirts of the city by Triss. The previously peaceful hamlet becomes a battleground when armed conflict breaks out between the Order of the Flaming Rose and the Scoia'tael. Geralt is forced to choose to support either faction, or make enemies of them both. Alvin is frightened and, using his Source abilities, magically disappears. When Geralt returns to Vizima, he finds that Temeria's regent King Foltest has also returned while Adda has relapsed in her curse and is in striga form once more. Under Foltest's direction, Geralt either assists the knights or the elves to restore order to the city as well as deals with Adda. Geralt then storms the Salamandra headquarters and kills Azar Javed, only to find that the gang's true leader is Jacques de Aldersberg, the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose. Foltest hires Geralt under a contract to slay Jacques to end the Salamandra threat. Geralt confronts Jacques, who explains that due to his Source abilities he has seen the eventual extinction of humanity due to the world-ending White Frost, and was attempting to engineer a genetically enhanced superior race of humans to survive this apocalypse. Geralt is also confronted by the King of the Wild Hunt, who warns him of an impending conflict. After Geralt defeats and slays Jacques, he notices that the Grand Master wore the same amulet of Alvin, revealing that de Aldersberg was actually the village boy he saved earlier, who traveled back in time by accident. After Geralt returns to Foltest with news of his success, the king is attacked by an assassin. Geralt defeats the attacker, only to find that the corpse was a Witcher, leading directly into The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings."

However, due to several other projects that the studio was involved in at the time, and concerns from their publisher TopWare about the materials' international appeal, the project never got farther than some initial media and a playable level. CD Projekt later approached Sapkowski for rights for the series. They were able to secure the rights for about 35,000 zloty (approximately ) from Sapkowski, who wanted all the payment upfront, rather than through royalties, even though these were offered to him. In a 2017 interview, Sapkowski said that at the time he had no interest in video games, and was only looking at the deal from a financial benefit standpoint."

Many changes have been introduced to the original engine; some of them are described below. One of the most important changes to the Aurora Engine involved developing the in-game environments in 3ds Max and then exporting them into the game engine, rather than using a tile-based system. This allowed the developers to make every environment unique from the others, rather than recycling the same tiled objects over and over again in different environments. CD Projekt's version of the engine also supports lightmaps generated in 3ds Max. Shadows created this way are reported to look more realistic, and provide better game performance. The modified engine also includes texture paint, a special tool that allows the developer to paint the environment using custom textures. New realistic skyboxes and water effects designed specifically for The Witcher were added to the engine. Natural light during various phases of the day is realistically altered, and the day and night transitions serve to enrich the game's ambiance. The weather can dynamically change between various states, such as clear skies, light rainfall or thunderstorms. Other significant changes include motion-captured animation, improved physics modeling, new mechanics, and a new combat system. Additional modifications include the introduction of portals and the inclusion of other graphical effects, such as glows, advanced dynamic shadows, blurs and others."

Some dialogue between characters is shortened in the non-Polish-language versions. Lead designer Michal Madej has disputed claims by fans that this was due to the sometimes crude language, but that the decision to edit down dialogue occurred because of production-related concerns in game development. Proofreader Martin Pagan noticed this shortened version during his work, and writer Sande Chen confirmed that it was not due to censorship. Fans have theorized that it may have been done for voice acting cost savings, especially since much of the vulgar language has been retained."

The significant changes featured in the enhanced version are over 200 new animations, additional NPC models, and recoloring of generic NPC models as well as monsters, vastly expanded and corrected dialogues in translated versions, improved stability, redesigned inventory system and load times reduced by roughly 80%. In addition, all bugs are said to be fixed, and the game manual completely overhauled. There are also two new adventures available to play through: Side Effects and The Price of Neutrality. A new option is to set the language of the voice acting and text separately. For instance, players can now choose to play the game with Polish  voices and English subtitles. Other featured languages are Russian, Italian, French, Spanish, German, Czech, Hungarian, and Chinese. Aside from the game enhancements, The Witcher Enhanced Edition includes a \"making of\" DVD, a CD with 29 in-game soundtracks, another CD with \"Inspired by\" music, the short story The Witcher from the book The Last Wish, a map of Temeria printed on high-quality paper, and the official strategy guide. In addition, a new and enhanced version of the D'jinni Adventure Editor is on the DVD with the two new Adventures. The game updates, as well as the box's extras, are available as a free download for owners of the original version who registered their game on the official forum. Furthermore, old savegames are compatible with the Enhanced Edition. According to CD Projekt co-founder Michal Kicinski, the Enhanced Edition required a $1 million investment, and the company had shipped 300,000 copies of the retail version worldwide as of December 2008. CD Projekt released a Director's Cut version of the game in North America on 31 July 2009. It is equal to the Enhanced Edition available to the rest of the world, but without the censorship applied to the North American version. The company has since released an official uncensoring patch that makes the North American version the same as the international for those who have purchased a boxed version of the game."

CD Projekt also confirmed that Rise of the White Wolf would have featured downloadable content. On 29 April 2009, it was announced that the production of the game had been halted due to late payments from CD Projekt to the French developers of the console version, Widescreen Games. A release from CD Projekt's CEO Micha\u0142 Kici\u0144ski stated that payments were delayed due to Widescreen games not meeting development deadlines, additionally saying that \"technical incapability created a risk of missing planned quality\" and that CD Projekt had ended their association with the company."

The paper is published by the media group La Vie-Le Monde (literally, \"The Life - The World\"). A \"Volume Zero\", in a print run of several hundred demonstration copies, was printed on the 22 June 1988. It was financed by a fund-raising round from family and friends of the founders, brought together a few months earlier in a method dubbed the \"calendar multiplier\" by Ronai and Rosselin. The magazine's publication was prescient, it was a time of important international news and the second issue sold . The issues published during the Gulf War, begun in January 1991, which translated Arab newspapers banned in France, were especially successful. A series of big world developments proved the viability of the concept: the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis described by Russian journalists, Algerian elections through the eyes of the Arab press, the Maastricht referendum as written about in Europe, and Bill Clinton's election as predicted by American newspapers. Jacques Rosselin, one of the founders, managed the magazine until the end of 1994, less than a year after it was bought by G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Occidentale (a subsidiary of Alcatel, which also owned L'Express and Le Point). The deal was completed in March 1994 for 83 million francs, though the magazine would wait until 1999 to break even. Courrier International  was then sold to Vivendi, together with L'Express, then to Le Monde group, which had looked to buy it since its creation.  Rosselin was succeeded by Bernard Wouts, who joined via G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Occidentale. Wouts, a former executive of le Monde, had met with the founders in 1989 but declined their offer to join the then fledgling magazine. Today the paper is part of Le Monde group and edited by Philippe Thureau-Dangin, who joined in 1993. A number of original employees are still there, the most senior are Hidenobu Suzuki and Kazuhiko Yatabe, who worked on number zero in June 1988. For its twentieth anniversary, on the 9 September 2010, Courrier international unveiled a new logo and layout. The redesign was accompanied by a marketing campaign which included an image of two planes circling, without colliding with, the digitally shortened towers of the World Trade Center in New York. The implication being that if the towers had been smaller there would have been no collision. The image, which illustrated the magazine's new slogan \u00ab Learn to anticipate \u00bb (\u00ab Apprendre \u00e0 anticiper \u00bb), solicited numerous negative reactions in the United States. In 2020 the circulation of Courier International was of 168,766 copies."

Salman Ahmad left Lahore, Pakistan, for New York with his family when he was eleven, and received his baptism in rock music when a friend offered him a ticket to a Led Zeppelin concert. Salman Ahmad was so enthralled by the show that he saved $235 to buy his own electric guitar. He also befriended Brian O'Connell in Tappan, another young aspiring musician, with whom Ahmad formed their first band together by the name of \"Eclipse\". Before the two friends could take their aspirations out of the basement and onto a bigger stage, Salman Ahmad's parents moved back to Pakistan in 1981, and Salman began to study medicine at Lahore's King Edward's Medical College. In 1987, Nusrat Hussain, by then the lead guitarist of the band Vital Signs, after composing the song \"Dil Dil Pakistan\", parted ways with Vital Signs and suggested Rohail Hyatt, founder and keyboardist of Vital Signs, to bring Salman Ahmad as his replacement in the band. Vital Signs then went on to record their debut album at the EMI Studios in Karachi, but almost all the songs were written and composed at Salman Ahmad's residence where the band had been lodged. In March 1989, the band released their debut album, Vital Signs 1, which was a success throughout the country. The following year, Salman Ahmad parted ways with the most successful pop band of Pakistan as he wanted a change in the band's music for their second album and therefore after leaving the band he went on to form his own band. First, he recruited singer Ali Azmat from the Jupiters and then the former Vital Signs lead guitarist, Nusrat Hussain, on keyboards. Junoon formed in 1990 when Salman Ahmad, founder, songwriter and lead guitarist, had a dream where one of his teachers shook him and said \"Tumhey mousiqui ka Junoon hai!\" (You have an obsession for music!). After the band's formation, its members were signed to major record label EMI Records and afterwards went on recording their self-titled debut album. The album features the emerging alternative rock instrumentation of the time, as well more palatable hard rock and AOR influences."

        "content": "Holly is an English-language surname and given name. Holly is known as an English or Irish surname (variant Holley) it is either locational, ultimately derived from the Old English hol l\u0113ah \"[dwelling by] the clearing by the hollow\", or descriptive, from hol-\u0113age \"hollow-eyed\". In Ireland, it was also used as a translation of the name Mac Cuilinn, which is derived from cuileann, the Gaelic name of the holly tree, and by extension sometimes of the similar-sounding  McQuillan surname of Ulster. The masculine names Holly, Hollie were derived from the surname, but have mostly fallen out of use since the mid 20th century due to the rise in popularity of the feminine name. Hollis is an English surname derived from a Middle English holis \"[dwelling by] holly trees\"; it was also used as a masculine given name. Holly (variants Hollie, Holley) was first used as a feminine given name in the 20th century, as a \"botanical\" name given to girls, in reference to, or at least secondarily associated with, the holly tree. While the feminine name is on record in the United States since the 1930s, its surge in popularity was due to Holly Golightly, the socialite protagonist in Truman Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's (1958), which was made into a film starring Audrey Hepburn in 1961. The name of this character is stated to be short for Holiday (rather than a reference to the plant). The name peaked in popularity in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, and has declined since, ranking at #380 in the United States as of 2009. It was popularly given in England and Wales during the 2000s, staying in the top 30 girls' names throughout 1996\u20132012, with a peak at rank #12 in 2002 (and dropping to rank #33 as of 2013). A tendency to give the name to girls born on or near Christmas has also been observed. More recent eccentric spellings of the feminine name include Holli (1970s), Holleigh, Hollee, Hollye."

Their grammatical forms and meanings have been reconstructed by modern linguists, based on similarities found across all Indo-European languages. This article discusses nouns and adjectives; Proto-Indo-European pronouns are treated elsewhere. The Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) had eight or nine cases, three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and probably originally two genders (animate and neuter), with the animate later splitting into the masculine and the feminine. Nominals fell into multiple different declensions. Most of them had word stems ending in a consonant (called athematic stems) and exhibited a complex pattern of accent shifts and/or vowel changes (ablaut) among the different cases. Two declensions ended in a vowel () and are called thematic; they were more regular and became more common during the history of PIE and its older daughter languages. PIE very frequently derived nominals from verbs. Just as English giver and gift are ultimately related to the verb give,  'giver' and  'gift' are derived from  'to give', but the practice was much more common in PIE. For example,  'foot' was derived from  'to tread', and  'house' from  'to build'."

A lexical word (as would appear in a dictionary) was formed by adding a suffix () onto a root () to form a stem. The word was then inflected by adding an ending () to the stem. The root indicates a basic concept, often a verb (e.g.  'give'), while the stem carries a more specific nominal meaning based on the combination of root and suffix (e.g.  'giver',  'gift'). Some stems cannot clearly be broken up into root and suffix altogether, as in  'bear'. The ending carries grammatical information, including case, number, and gender. Gender is an inherent property of a noun but is part of the inflection of an adjective, because it must agree with the gender of the noun it modifies."

        "content": "The process of forming a lexical stem from a root is known in general as derivational morphology, while the process of inflecting that stem is known as inflectional morphology. As in other languages, the possible suffixes that can be added to a given root, and the meaning that results, are not entirely predictable, while the process of inflection is largely predictable in both form and meaning. Originally, extensive ablaut (vowel variation, between  and \u00d8, i.e. no vowel) occurred in PIE, in both derivation and inflection and in the root, suffix, and ending. Variation in the position of the accent likewise occurred in both derivation and inflection, and is often considered part of the ablaut system (which is described in more detail below). For example, the nominative form  'lake' (composed of the root  in the ablaut form , the suffix in the form  and the ending in the form ) had the genitive  (root form , suffix  and ending ). In this word, the nominative has the ablaut vowels  while the genitive has the ablaut vowels  \u2014 i.e. all three components have different ablaut vowels, and the stress position has also moved. A large number of different patterns of ablaut variation existed; speakers had to both learn the ablaut patterns and memorize which pattern went with which word. There was a certain regularity of which patterns occurred with which suffixes and formations, but with many exceptions. Already by late PIE times, this system was extensively simplified, and daughter languages show a steady trend towards more and more regularization and simplification. Far more simplification occurred in the late PIE nominal system than in the verbal system, where the original PIE ablaut variations were maintained essentially intact well into the recorded history of conservative daughter languages such as Sanskrit and Ancient Greek, as well as in the Germanic languages (in the form of strong verbs)."

This type of derivation is also found in verbs, mainly to form the perfect.

Since all roots end in a consonant, all thematic nominals have suffixes ending in a vowel, and none are root nouns. The accent is fixed on the same syllable throughout the inflection. From the perspective of the daughter languages, a distinction is often made between vowel stems (that is, stems ending in a vowel: i-, u-, (y)\u0101-, (y)o-stems) and consonantic stems (the rest). However, from the PIE perspective, only the thematic (o-)stems are truly vocalic.

        "content": "Late PIE had three genders, traditionally called masculine, feminine and neuter. Gender or noun class is an inherent (lexical) property of each noun; all nouns in a language that has grammatical genders are assigned to one of its classes. Originally, there probably were only an animate (masculine/feminine) and an inanimate (neuter) gender. This view is supported by the existence of certain classes of Latin and Ancient Greek adjectives which inflect only for two sets of endings: one for masculine and feminine, the other for neuter. Further evidence comes from the Anatolian languages such as Hittite which exhibit only the animate and the neuter genders. The feminine ending is thought to have developed from a collective/abstract suffix  that also gave rise to the neuter collective. The existence of combined collective and abstract grammatical forms can be seen in English words such as youth = \"the young people (collective)\" or \"young age (abstract)\". Remnants of this period exist in (e.g.) the eh\u2082-stems, ih\u2082-stems, uh\u2082-stems and bare h\u2082-stems, which are found in daughter languages as \u0101-, \u012b-, \u016b- and a-stems, respectively. They originally were the feminine equivalents of the o-stems, i-stems, u-stems and root nouns. Already by late PIE times, however, this system was breaking down.  became generalized as the feminine suffix, and eh\u2082-stem nouns evolved more and more in the direction of thematic o-stems, with fixed ablaut and accent, increasingly idiosyncratic endings and frequent borrowing of endings from the o-stems. Nonetheless, clear traces of the earlier system are seen especially in Sanskrit, where \u012b-stems and \u016b-stems still exist as distinct classes comprising largely feminine nouns. Over time, these stem classes merged with i-stems and u-stems, with frequent crossover of endings. Grammatical gender correlates only partially with sex, and almost exclusively when it relates to humans and domesticated animals. Even then, those correlations may not be consistent: nouns referring to adult males are usually masculine (e.g father, brother, priest), nouns referring to adult females (e.g. mother, sister, priestess) are usually feminine, but diminutives may be neuter regardless of referent, as in both Greek and German. Gender may have also had a grammatical function, a change of gender within a sentence signaling the end of a noun phrase (a head noun and its agreeing adjectives) and the start of a new one. An alternative hypothesis to the two-gender view is that Proto-Anatolian inherited a three-gender PIE system, and subsequently Hittite and other Anatolian languages eliminated the feminine by merging it with the masculine."

For example, the original form of the genitive plural is a particular thorny issue, because different daughter languages appear to reflect different proto-forms. It is variously reconstructed as , etc. Meanwhile, the dual endings of cases other than the merged nominative/vocative/accusative are often considered impossible to reconstruct because these endings are attested sparsely and diverge radically in different languages. The following shows three modern mainstream reconstructions. Sihler (1995) remains closest to the data, often reconstructing multiple forms when daughter languages show divergent outcomes. Ringe (2006) is somewhat more speculative, willing to assume analogical changes in some cases to explain divergent outcomes from a single source form. Fortson (2004) is between Sihler and Ringe. The thematic vowel  ablauts to  only in word-final position in the vocative singular, and before  in the neuter nominative and accusative plural. The vocative singular is also the only case for which the thematic nouns show accent retraction, a leftward shift of the accent, denoted by . \u2020The dative, instrumental and ablative plural endings probably contained a  but are of uncertain structure otherwise. They might also have been of post-PIE date. \u00a7For athematic nouns, an endingless locative is reconstructed in addition to the ordinary locative singular in . In contrast to the other weak cases, it typically has full or lengthened grade of the stem. An alternative reconstruction is found in Beekes (1995). This reconstruction does not give separate tables for the thematic and athematic endings, assuming that they were originally the same and only differentiated in daughter languages."

        "content": "For the strong cases of proterokinetic nominals, the accent is placed on the penultimate syllable of the stem. If there is only one suffix, the root will be the penultimate syllable; when there is more than one suffix, the penultimate syllable will be a suffix, and the root will appear unaccented and in the zero grade. There is an unexpected o-grade of the suffix in the strong cases of polysyllabic amphikinetic nominals. Another unusual property of this class is the locative singular having a stressed e-grade suffix. The classification of the amphikinetic root nouns is disputed. Since those words have no suffix, they differ from the amphikinetic polysyllables in the strong cases (no o-grade) and in the locative singular (no e-grade suffix). Some scholars prefer to call them amphikinetic and the corresponding polysyllables holokinetic (or holodynamic, from holos = whole). Some also list mesostatic (meso = middle) and teleutostatic types, with the accent fixed on the suffix and the ending, respectively, but their existence in PIE is disputed. The classes can then be grouped into three static (acrostatic, mesostatic, teleutostatic) and three or four mobile (proterokinetic, hysterokinetic, amphikinetic, holokinetic) paradigms."

        "content": "Ancient Greek Zde\u00fas 'Zeus', gen. Di(w)\u00f3s, Vedic Sanskrit d(i)y\u0101\u00fa\u1e25 'heaven', gen. div\u00e1\u1e25, dy\u014d\u1e25, both < PIE  'sky, day, god' Proto-Germanic reconstructed *tan(\u00fe)s 'tooth' gen. *tundiz < PIE , with the nominative stem preserved in Old Norse t\u01ebnn, Old Saxon tand, Old English t\u014d\u00fe, and the genitive stem in Gothic tundus. The most extensive remains are in Vedic Sanskrit and Old Avestan (the oldest recorded stages of the oldest Indic and Iranian languages, c. 1700-1300 BC); the younger stages of the same languages already show extensive regularization. In many cases, a former ablauting paradigm was generalized in the daughter languages but in different ways in each language. For example, Ancient Greek d\u00f3ru 'spear' < PIE nominative  'wood, tree' and Old English tr\u0113o 'tree' < PIE genitive  reflect different stems of a PIE ablauting paradigm PIE , PIE nominative  and genitive , which is still reflected directly in Vedic Sanskrit nom. d\u0101\u0301ru 'wood', gen. dr\u1e53s. Similarly, PIE  can be reconstructed from 'knee' from Ancient Greek g\u00f3nu and Old English kn\u0113o. In that case, there is no extant ablauting paradigm in a single language, but Avestan accusative \u017en\u016bm and Modern Persian z\u0101n\u016b are attested, which strongly implies that Proto-Iranian had an ablauting paradigm. That is quite possible for Avestan as well, but that cannot be certain since the nominative is not extant. An ablauting paradigm  can also clearly be reconstructed from 'foot', based on Greek pous gen. pod\u00f3s (< ) vs. Latin p\u0113s gen. pedis (< ) vs. Old English f\u014dt (< ), with differing ablaut grades among cognate forms in different languages. In some cases, ablaut would be expected based on the form (given numerous other examples of ablauting nouns of the same form), but a single ablaut variant is found throughout the paradigm. In such cases, it is often assumed that the noun had showed ablaut in early PIE but was generalized to a single form by late PIE or shortly afterwards. An example is Greek g\u00e9nus 'chin, jaw', Sanskrit h\u00e1nus 'jaw', Latin gena 'cheek', Gothic kinnus 'cheek'. All except the Latin form suggest a masculine u-stem with non-ablauting PIE root , but certain irregularities (the position of the accent, the unexpected feminine \u0101-stem form in Latin, the unexpected Gothic stem kinn- < \u01f5enw-, the ablaut found in Greek gn\u00e1thos 'jaw' < PIE , Lithuanian \u017e\u00e1ndas 'jawbone' < ) suggest an original ablauting neuter noun  in early PIE. It generalized the nominative ablaut in late PIE and switched to the masculine u-stem in the post-PIE period. Another example is  'night'; an acrostatic root paradigm might be expected based on the form, but the consistent stem  is found throughout the family. With the discovery of Hittite, however, the form /nek\u02b7ts/ 'in the evening' was found, which is evidently a genitive; it indicates that early PIE actually had an acrostatic paradigm that was regularized by late PIE but after the separation of Hittite."

        "content": "Kuiper's student Beekes, together with his colleague Kortlandt, developed an alternative model on the basis of Pedersen's and Kuiper's works, described in detail in . Since the scholars who developed it and generally accept it are mostly from the University of Leiden, it is generally dubbed the Leiden model. It states that for earlier PIE, three accent types of inflection of consonant stems are to be reconstructed, and from them, all of the attested types can be derived: For root nouns, accentuation could have been either static or mobile: The thematic stem type was a recent innovation, with a thematic vowel *-o- originating from the hysterodynamic genitive singular form of athematic inflection, which had in pre-PIE the function of ergative. That is why there are o-stems but no e-stems and is suggested to be why thematic nouns show no ablaut or accentual mobility in inflection (for other theories on the origin of thematic vowel see Thematic vowel: Origin in nouns). The general points of departure to the Erlangen model are: Both models share (acro)static and proterodynamic patterns. The hysterokinetic and amphikinetic patterns are reconstructed only in the Erlangen model. The hysterodynamic model exists only in the Leiden model and represents an earlier stage of the hysterokinetic and amphikinetic patterns of the Erlangen model. The reconstruction of the paradigm is not based only on internal reconstruction. It is synchronically still attested in the Hittite paradigm of the word for \"hand\": ke\u0161\u0161ar, ki\u0161\u0161eran, ki\u0161ra\u0161. That is therefore one of the most archaic paradigms in PIE. The Leiden model describes a stage, Early PIE, that is relatively older than the Erlangen model. The Leiden model has a one-to-one correlation between the presence of the full grade vowel and the position of the accent, which indicates a historical connection between the two. At the stage of the Leiden model, there was only one phonemic vowel, as *e was always accented, and the new vowel, *o, was always unaccented. Both were therefore in complementary distribution."

An example is proterokinetic  'sacred formulation' (Vedic br\u00e1hma\u1e47-), from which amphikinetic  'priest' (Vedic brahm\u00e1\u1e47-) was derived. Another ablaut alternation is  'horned' from  'horn, roe'. Many PIE adjectives formed this way were subsequently nominalized in daughter languages. Thematic nominals could also be derived by accent or ablaut changes. Leftward shift of the accent could turn an agentive word into a resultative one, e.g.  'sharp', but  'a slice' (from  'to cut');  'carrier', but  'burden' (from  'carry'). A special type of ablaut alternation was v\u1e5bddhi derivation, which typically lengthened a vowel, signifying \"of, belonging to, descended from\"."

The old man himself is a Finn who tells the story of how he had fallen in love with a beautiful young maiden, Naina (\u041d\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430), who spurned his attention. In order to win her love he tried to become a glorious warrior, but when she rejected him, spent years learning the magical arts instead. He finally cast a spell to win Naina's love, only to find that she herself was actually an old crone. After he rejected her, she became bent on revenge.

Then, he gives it a slap powerful enough to knock it off its place. Where it once stood, Ruslan finds a shining sword suitable for a bogatyr.  As Ruslan prepares to attack with the sword, the head pleads for mercy. The head tells his story:  He was once a mighty warrior, the brother of Chernomor, who envied him.  Chernomor's magic power lay in his beard, and he told his brother that they must secure the sword, which had the power to kill the both of them \u2013 Chernomor, by cutting his beard, the brother, by severing his head.  They set off in quest of the sword, but then disputed to whom it should belong once they found it.  Chernomor proposed that they both put their heads to the ground and the sword would go to the one who first heard a sound.  Instead, he used the sword to sever his brother's head, which magically remained alive. The head tells Ruslan that he bears no grudge and will be grateful if Ruslan uses the sword to defeat Chernomor."

The name Ruslan is adapted from Yeruslan Lazarevich, who appears in earlier Russian tales and is mentioned in Pushkin's The Moor of Peter the Great.

        "content": "In Rainbows is the seventh studio album by the English rock band Radiohead. It was self-released on 10 October 2007 as a pay-what-you-want download, followed by a physical release internationally through XL Recordings and in North America through TBD Records. It was Radiohead's first release after their recording contract with EMI ended with their album Hail to the Thief (2003). Radiohead began work on In Rainbows in early 2005. In 2006, after initial recording sessions with new producer Spike Stent proved fruitless, the band toured Europe and North America, performing the new material. After re-enlisting longtime producer Nigel Godrich, Radiohead recorded in the country houses Halswell House and Tottenham House, the Hospital Club in London, and their studio in Oxfordshire. They incorporated a variety of styles and instruments, using electronic instruments, strings, piano and the ondes Martenot. The lyrics are less political and more personal than previous Radiohead albums. EMI, which had been recently acquired by Terra Firma, hoped to sign Radiohead to a new record contract; however, Radiohead did not trust the new management and negotiations collapsed over ownership of their back catalogue. Instead, they self-released In Rainbows online, saying this removed barriers between artists and fans and liberated them from traditional promotional formats. The pay-what-you-want release, the first for a major act, made headlines internationally and created debate about the implications for the music industry; some praised Radiohead for challenging old models and finding new ways to connect with fans, while others felt it set a dangerous precedent at the expense of less successful artists. Radiohead promoted In Rainbows with webcasts, music videos, remix and music video competitions, and a worldwide tour. \"Jigsaw Falling into Place\" and \"Nude\" were released as singles; \"Nude\" became Radiohead's first US top-40 song since their debut single \"Creep\" (1992). The retail release of In Rainbows topped the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200, and by October 2008 the album had sold over three million copies worldwide. It received critical acclaim, winning Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package, and was ranked one of the best albums of the year and the decade by various publications. Rolling Stone ranked In Rainbows on its updated lists of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time at number 336 in 2012 and number 387 in 2020."

As Hail to the Thief was the last album released under their six-album contract with EMI, they had no contractual obligation to release new material. According to the New York Times in 2006, Radiohead were \"by far the world's most popular unsigned band\". Drummer Philip Selway said Radiohead still wanted to create music, but took a break to focus on other areas of their lives, and the end of their contract provided a natural point to pause and reflect. Singer and songwriter Thom Yorke recorded his first solo album, The Eraser (2006), and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood composed his first solo works, the soundtracks Bodysong (2004) and There Will Be Blood (2007)."

        "content": "In March 2005, Radiohead began writing and recording in their Oxfordshire studio. They initially chose to work without their longtime producer Nigel Godrich; according to guitarist Ed O'Brien, \"We were a little bit in the comfort zone ... We've been working together for 10 years, and we all love one another too much.\" Bassist Colin Greenwood later denied this, saying Godrich had been busy working with Charlotte Gainsbourg and Beck. At the Ether Festival in July 2005, Greenwood and Yorke performed a version of the future In Rainbows track \"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\" with the London Sinfonietta orchestra and the Arab Orchestra of Nazareth. Regular recording sessions began in August 2005, with Radiohead updating fans on their progress intermittently on their new blog, Dead Air Space. The sessions were slow, and the band struggled to regain confidence; according to Yorke, \"We spent a long time in the studio just not going anywhere, wasting our time, and that was really, really frustrating.\" They attributed their slow progress to a lack of momentum after their break, the lack of deadline and producer and the fact that all the members had become fathers. O'Brien said the band considered splitting up, but kept working \"because when you got beyond all the shit and the bollocks, the core of these songs were really good\". In December 2005, Radiohead hired producer Spike Stent, who had worked with artists including U2 and Bj\u00f6rk, to help them work through their material. O'Brien told Mojo: \"Spike listened to the stuff we'd been self-producing. These weren't demos, they\u2019d been recorded in proper studios, and he said, 'The sounds aren't good enough.'\" However, the collaboration with Stent was unsuccessful. In an effort to break the deadlock, Radiohead decided to tour for the first time since 2004. They performed in Europe and North America in May and June 2006, and returned to Europe for several festivals in August, performing many new songs. According to Yorke, the tour forced them to finish writing the songs. He said: \"Rather than it being a nightmare, it was really, really good fun, because suddenly everyone is being spontaneous and no one's self-conscious because you're not in the studio ... It felt like being 16 again.\" After the tour, Radiohead scrapped their recordings and re-enlisted Godrich,<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite magazine |last=Vozick-Levinson |first=Simon |date=27 April 2012 |title=The making of Radiohead's In Rainbows''' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-making-of-radioheads-in-rainbows-187534/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730031338/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-making-of-radioheads-in-rainbows-187534/|archive-date=30 July 2019|access-date=30 July 2019 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> who, according to Yorke, \"gave us a walloping kick up the arse\". In October 2006, recording restarted at Tottenham House in Marlborough, Wiltshire, a country house scouted by Godrich where Radiohead worked for three weeks. The band members lived in caravans, as the building was in a state of disrepair; Yorke described it as \"derelict in the stricter sense of the word, where there's holes in the floor, rain coming through the ceilings, half the window panes missing ... There were places you just basically didn't go. It definitely had an effect. It had some pretty strange vibes.\" The sessions were productive, and the band recorded \"Jigsaw Falling into Place\" and \"Bodysnatchers\". In October, Yorke wrote on Dead Air Space that Radiohead had \"started the record properly now ... starting to get somewhere I think. Finally.\" In December 2006, sessions took place at Halswell House, Taunton, and Godrich's Hospital studio in Covent Garden, London, where Radiohead recorded \"Videotape\" and \"Nude\". In January 2007, Radiohead resumed recording in their Oxfordshire studio and started to post photos, lyrics, videos and samples of new songs on Dead Air Space. In June, having wrapped up recording, Godrich posted clips of songs on Dead Air Space. Excluding \"Last Flowers\", which Yorke recorded in the Eraser sessions, the In Rainbows sessions produced 16 songs. Feeling Hail to the Thief was overlong, Radiohead wanted their next album to be concise. Yorke said: \"I believe in the rock album as an artistic form of expression. In Rainbows is a conscious return to this form of 45-minute statement ... Our aim was to describe in 45 minutes, as coherently and conclusively as possible, what moves us.\" They settled on 10 songs, saving the rest for a bonus disc included in the limited edition. The album was mastered by Bob Ludwig in July 2007 at Gateway Mastering, New York City."

        "content": "MusicIn Rainbows incorporates elements of art rock, experimental rock, art pop, and electronica. The opening track, \"15 Step\", features a handclap rhythm inspired by \"Fuck the Pain Away\" by Peaches. Radiohead recorded handclaps by a group of children from the Matrix Music School & Arts Centre in Oxford; when the clapping proved \"not quite good enough\", they recorded the children cheering instead. \"Bodysnatchers\", which Yorke described as a combination of Wolfmother, Neu! and \"dodgy hippy rock\", was recorded when he was in a period of \"hyperactive mania\". On \"All I Need\", Jonny Greenwood wanted to capture the white noise generated by a band playing loudly in a room, which never occurs in the studio. His solution was to have a string section play every note of the scale, blanketing the frequencies. Radiohead recorded a version of \"Nude\" during the OK Computer sessions, but discarded it; this version was inspired by Al Green, and featured a Hammond organ, a \"straighter\" feel, and different lyrics. During the early sessions for In Rainbows, Colin Greenwood wrote a new bassline for the song, which, according to Godrich, \"transformed it from something very straight into something that had much more of a rhythmic flow\". \"Reckoner\" features Yorke's falsetto, \"frosty, clanging\" percussion, a \"meandering\" guitar line, piano, and a string arrangement by guitarist Jonny Greenwood. Yorke described the song as \"kind of a love song ... Sort of.\" Radiohead developed it from another song by the same name; Yorke released the original song as a solo single, \"Feeling Pulled Apart by Horses\", in 2009. Yorke described the process of composing \"Videotape\" as \"absolute agony\", and said it \"went through every possible parameter\". He initially wanted it to be a \"post-rave trance track\", similar to the music of Surgeon, and Jonny Greenwood was \"obsessed\" with shifting the start of the bar. A more traditional arrangement, performed on Radiohead's 2006 tour, featured Selway's drums building to a climax. Eventually, Godrich and Greenwood stripped the song down to a minimal piano ballad with percussion from a Roland TR-909 drum machine."

It very much explores the ideas of transience. It starts in one place and ends somewhere completely different.\" In another interview, Yorke said the album was \"about the fucking panic of realising you're going to die! And that any time soon [I could] possibly [have] a heart attack when I next go for a run.\" O'Brien described the lyrics as \"universal. There wasn't a political agenda. It's being human.\" The song \"Bodysnatchers\" was inspired by Victorian ghost stories, the 1972 novel The Stepford Wives and Yorke's feeling of \"your physical consciousness trapped without being able to connect fully with anything else\". \"Jigsaw Falling into Place\" was inspired by the chaos witnessed by Yorke when he used to go out on the weekend in Oxford. He said: \"The lyrics are quite caustic\u2014the idea of 'before you're comatose' or whatever, drinking yourself into oblivion and getting fucked-up to forget ... [There] is partly this elation.

On 10 December, the download was removed. Fans could also order a limited \"discbox\" edition from Radiohead's website, containing the album on CD and two 12\" heavyweight 45 rpm vinyl records with artwork and lyric booklets, plus an enhanced CD with eight additional tracks, digital photos and artwork, packaged in a hardcover book and slipcase. The limited edition was shipped from December 2007. In June 2009, Radiohead made the second In Rainbows disc available for download on their website for \u00a36. Radiohead ruled out an internet-only distribution, saying that 80% of people still bought physical releases and that it was important for them to have \"an object\".

        "content": "The pay-what-you-want release, the first for a major musical act, attracted international media attention and sparked debate about the implications for the music industry. According to Mojo, the release was \"hailed as a revolution in the way major bands sell their music\", and the media's reaction was \"almost overwhelmingly positive\". Time called it \"easily the most important release in the recent history of the music business\" and Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that \"for the beleaguered recording business Radiohead has put in motion the most audacious experiment in years\". NME wrote that \"the music world seemed to judder several rimes off its axis\", and praised the fact that everyone, from fans to critics, had access to the album at the same time on release day: \"the kind of moment of togetherness you don't get very often\". U2 singer Bono praised Radiohead as \"courageous and imaginative in trying to figure out some new relationship with their audience\". Courtney Love wrote on her blog: \"The kamikaze pilot in me wants to do the same damn thing. I'm grateful for Radiohead for making the first move.\" Jay-Z described the release as \"genius\". The release also drew criticism. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails thought it did not go far enough, and accused Radiohead of using a compressed digital release as a bait-and-switch to promote a traditional record sale. Reznor independently released his sixth album Ghosts I\u2013IV under a Creative Commons licence the following year. Singer Lily Allen said the release was \"arrogant\" and sent a bad message to less successful acts, saying: \"You don't choose how to pay for eggs. Why should it be different for music?\" Sonic Youth bassist Kim Gordon said the release \"seemed really community-oriented, but it wasn't catered towards their musician brothers and sisters, who don't sell as many records [as Radiohead]. It makes everyone else look bad for not offering their music for whatever.\" Guardian journalist Will Hodgkinson argued that Radiohead had made it impossible for less successful musicians to make a living from their music. The release surprised record executives; an unidentified executive at a major European label told Time: \"This feels like yet another death knell. If the best band in the world doesn't want a part of us, I'm not sure what's left for this business.\" U2 manager Paul McGuinness said that 60 to 70 percent of Radiohead fans had pirated the album, and saw this as an indication that Radiohead's strategy had failed. However, media measurement company BigChampagne concluded that the music industry should not think of piracy as lost sales, as Radiohead had shown that even releasing music free had not deterred it. Based on this report, Wired concluded that \"by 'losing' the battle for the email addresses of those who downloaded their album via bit torrent, [Radiohead] actually won the overall war for the public's attention \u2013 no easy feat, these days\". In a retrospective article, NME argued that Radiohead had demonstrated that the best response to piracy was to explore alternative ways to connect with fans, offering content at different price points: \"The pay-what-you-want aspect isn't something to be followed slavishly ... It's the willingness to try it and the connection with fans that made it successful that should be an inspiration.\" Responding to criticisms, Jonny Greenwood said Radiohead were responding to the culture of downloading free music, which he likened to the legend of King Canute: \"You can't pretend the flood isn't happening.\" Colin said the criticism was \"worrying about all these ancillary questions and forgetting about the primal urge of people to share and enjoy music. And there's always going to be a way of finding money or livings to be made out of it.\" Yorke told the BBC: \"We have a moral justification in what we did in the sense that the majors and the big infrastructure of the music business has not addressed the way artists communicate directly with their fans ... Not only do they get in the way, but they take all the cash.\" Radiohead's managers defended the release as \"a solution for Radiohead, not the industry\", and doubted \"it would work the same way [for Radiohead] ever again\". Radiohead have not used the pay-what-you-want system for subsequent releases. In February 2013, Yorke told the Guardian that though Radiohead had hoped to subvert the corporate music industry with In Rainbows, he feared they had instead played into the hands of content providers such as Apple and Google: \"They have to keep commodifying things to keep the share price up, but in doing so they have made all content, including music and newspapers, worthless, in order to make their billions. And this is what we want?\""

        "content": "As Radiohead's recording contract with EMI ended in 2003, Radiohead recorded In Rainbows without a record label. Shortly before work began, Yorke told Time: \"I like the people at our record company, but the time is at hand when you have to ask why anyone needs one. And, yes, it probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say 'fuck you' to this decaying business model.\" In August 2007, as Radiohead were finishing In Rainbows, EMI was acquired by the private equity firm Terra Firma for US$6.4 billion (\u00a34.7 billion), with Guy Hands as the new chief executive. EMI executives including Keith Wozencroft, who had signed Radiohead to EMI, travelled regularly to Radiohead's Oxfordshire studio in hopes of negotiating a new contract. The executives were \"devastated\" when Radiohead's team informed them of their self-release plan a day before the album was announced. O'Brien later said he had not realised the band's importance to EMI: \"That probably sounds really naive. But there weren't people going, 'You're so important.' We were just one of the bands on their roster.\" Hands believed that Radiohead would only have canceled their self-release plan with a \"really big\" offer. According to Eamonn Forde, author of The Final Days of EMI, Radiohead had lost faith in EMI and thought the new ownership would be a \"bloodbath\". O'Brien said Radiohead initially believed a deal with EMI could have been made, and said: \"It was really sad to leave all the people [we'd worked with] ... But Terra Firma don't understand the music industry.\" An EMI spokesperson stated that Radiohead had demanded \"an extraordinary amount of money\" for a new contract. Yorke and Radiohead's management released statements denying that they had asked for a large advance, but had instead wanted control over their back catalogue, which Hands had refused. According to Hands: \"They wanted a lot of money ... And they wanted their masters back, which we valued even more. At our valuation, it was millions and millions that they wanted.\" Responding to Hands's statement, Yorke told an interviewer: \"It fucking pissed me off. We could have taken them to court. The idea that we were after so much money was stretching the truth to breaking point. That was his PR company briefing against us and I'll tell you what, it fucking ruined my Christmas.\" Days after Radiohead signed to XL, EMI announced a box set of Radiohead material recorded before In Rainbows, released in the same week as the In Rainbows special edition. Radiohead were reportedly \"incensed\" at the release; commentators including the Guardian saw it as retaliation for the band choosing not to sign with EMI. Hands defended the reissues as necessary to boost EMI's revenues, and said that \"we don't have a huge amount of reasons to be nice [to Radiohead]\". The box set was promoted on Google Ads with an advert falsely claiming that In Rainbows was included; EMI removed it, citing a \"data source glitch\".

In the US, \"Scotch Mist\" was also broadcast on Current TV. The webcasts featured performances of In Rainbows songs, covers of songs by New Order and the Smiths, poetry, and videos created with comedian Adam Buxton and filmmaker Garth Jennings. Colin Greenwood described the webcasts as spontaneous and liberating: \"It was so cool because we didn't have to go through three weeks of video commissioning and receiving dodgy scripts set on abandoned skyscrapers in downtown LA or something.\" In March 2008, Radiohead ran a contest with animation company Aniboom whereby entrants submitted concepts for animated music videos for In Rainbows songs. Semifinalists were chosen by TBD Records and the Cartoon Network programming block Adult Swim. Unable to choose only one winner, Radiohead awarded the full prize money of $10,000 each to four semifinalists, who created videos for \"15 Step\", \"Weird Fishes\", \"Reckoner\" and \"Videotape\". Radiohead held remix competitions for \"Nude\" and \"Reckoner\", releasing the separated stems for fans to download; the entries were streamed on the Radiohead website. The first single from In Rainbows, \"Jigsaw Falling into Place\", was released in January 2008, followed by \"Nude\" on 31 March. They were accompanied by music videos directed by Buxton and Jennings. \"Nude\" debuted at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100; boosted by sales of the remix stems, it was the first Radiohead song to enter the chart since \"High and Dry\" (1995) and their first US top-40 song since their debut single \"Creep\" (1992). In July, Radiohead released a video for \"House of Cards\", made with lidar technology instead of cameras. In February 2009, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed \"15 Step\" with the University of Southern California Marching Band at the televised 51st Annual Grammy Awards."

Radiohead toured North America, Europe, South America and Japan from May 2008 until March 2009. To determine how they could reduce carbon emissions for the tour, Radiohead commissioned the environmental group Best Foot Forward. Based on the findings, Radiohead played in amphitheatres in city centres to reduce reliance on flights for attendees, and used a carbon-neutral \"forest\" of LEDs on stage.

        "content": "In early October 2007, a Radiohead spokesperson reported that most downloaders paid \"a normal retail price\" for the digital version of In Rainbows, and that most fans had pre-ordered the limited edition. Citing a source close to the band, Gigwise reported that In Rainbows had sold 1.2 million digital copies before its retail release; this was dismissed by Radiohead's co-manager Bryce Edge as \"exaggerated\". According to research released in November 2007 by the market research firm Comscore, downloaders paid an average of $2.26 per download globally, and 62% of downloaders paid nothing. Of those who paid, the average paid was $6 globally, with 12% paying between $8 and $12, around the typical cost of an album on iTunes. Radiohead dismissed the report as \"wholly inaccurate\", but said that the results had been good. In December 2007, Yorke said that Radiohead had made more money from digital sales of In Rainbows than the digital sales of all previous Radiohead albums combined. In October 2008, one year after the release, Warner Chappell reported that although most people paid nothing for the download, prerelease sales for In Rainbows had been more profitable than the total sales of Hail to the Thief and that the limited edition had sold 100,000 copies. In 2009, Wired reported that Radiohead had made an \"instantaneous\" \u00a33 million from the album. Pitchfork saw this as proof that, thanks to their fans, \"Radiohead could release a record on the most secretive terms, basically for free, and still be wildly successful, even as industry profits continued to plummet.\" According to the media measurement company BigChampagne, on the day of release, around 400,000 copies of In Rainbows were pirated via torrent. It had been shared 2.3 million times by 3 November 2007. At its peak, it was shared many times more than the second-most shared album released in the same period. Some piracy came from users driven to torrents after the official website overloaded."

Various reviewers, such as The Guardians Alexis Petridis, attributed the album's quality to Radiohead's performance in the studio and that the band sounded like they were enjoying themselves. Others, such as Billboards Jonathan Cohen, commended the album for not being overshadowed by its marketing hype. Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that In Rainbows \"will hopefully be remembered as Radiohead's most stimulating synthesis of accessible songs and abstract sounds, rather than their first pick-your-price download\". The NME described the album as \"Radiohead reconnecting with their human sides, realising you [can] embrace pop melodies and proper instruments while still sounding like paranoid androids ... This [is] otherworldly music, alright.\" Will Hermes, writing in Entertainment Weekly, called In Rainbows \"the gentlest, prettiest Radiohead set yet\" and stated that it \"uses the full musical and emotional spectra to conjure breathtaking beauty\". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised its \"vividly collaborative sonic touches\" and concluded: \"No wasted moments, no weak tracks: just primo Radiohead.\" In 2011, The Rolling Stone Album Guide described it as Radiohead's \"most expansive and seductive album, possibly their all-time high\". Jon Dolan of Blender called In Rainbows \"far more pensive and reflective\" than Hail to the Thief, writing that it \"formulates a lush, sensualized ideal out of vague, layered discomfort\". Spins Mikael Wood felt that the album \"succeeds because all of that cold, clinical lab work hasn't eliminated the warmth from their music\", while Pitchforks Mark Pytlik dubbed it a more \"human\" album that \"represents the sound of Radiohead coming back to earth\". Robert Christgau, writing for MSN Music, gave In Rainbows a two-star honourable mention and noted that the album, having been developed in concert, was \"more jammy, less songy and less Yorkey, which is good\". The Wire was more critical, finding \"a sense here of a group magisterially marking time, shying away ... from any grand, rhetorical, countercultural purpose\". Accolades In Rainbows was ranked among the best albums of 2007 by many music publications. It was ranked number one by Billboard, Mojo and PopMatters, third by NME and The A.V. Club, fourth by Pitchfork and Q, and sixth by Rolling Stone and Spin. It was also ranked one of the best albums of the decade by several publications: NME ranked it 10th, Paste 45th, Rolling Stone 30th, the Guardian 22nd, and Newsweek fifth. Rolling Stone ranked In Rainbows on its updated lists of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time at number 336 in 2012 and 387 in 2020. It was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 2019, the Guardian named it the 11th greatest album of the 21st century so far. In 2020, Rolling Stone named In Rainbows one of the 40 most groundbreaking albums for its pay-what-you want release, influencing acts such as Beyonc\u00e9 and U2. In 2021, Pitchfork readers voted In Rainbows the fourth-greatest album of the previous 25 years.In Rainbows was nominated for the short list of the 2008 Mercury Prize, and won the Grammy awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards. It was also nominated for Grammy awards for Album of the Year and Producer of the Year, Non-Classical (for Nigel Godrich), and \"House of Cards\" was nominated for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, Best Rock Song and Best Music Video."

In Suzdal, he runs into a family of an old teacher Maria Alexandrovna (Yevgeniya Nechayeva) with venerable, traditional notions of morality and honor. Kim tries to woo the art historian and local museum guide Sasha (Inna Churikova), a pupil of Maria Alexandrovna, but she just plainly imparts to him about how mediocre and immoral his plays are. Later Kim Yesenin is a secret witness to a farewell conversation of Sasha with her lover, nicknamed as \"The Hirsute\" (Stanislav Lyubshin). The Hirsute is a frustrated scientist and writer, planning to emigrate to the United States (in the scene of parting with The Hirsute, Sasha shouts: \"What are you going to do in this America?!\"). At night, Yesenin is trying to depart for Moscow, but changes his mind midway, turns around and crashes his car on the slippery road. In the final scene, severely wounded, he gets to a phone booth and calls Sasha. Without being able to communicate anything sensible to her Yesenin loses consciousness. Lieutenant Sinitsyn (Sergey Nikonenko) who happens to pass by, picks him up onto his motorcycle which has a sidecar attached - and on this frame the picture ends.

The official policy of Vicipaedia is that neologisms and user coinings are not allowed (\"Noli fingere!\" Latin for \"Don't coin/make up things\"). In order to deal with concepts that did not exist in Classical or Medieval Latin, terms from modern Latin sources are used, such as botanical Latin, scientific Latin, 18th- and 19th-century Latin language encyclopedias and books, the official  Vatican dictionary of modern Latin, as well as current Latin newspapers and radio shows, such as Ephemeris and Radio Bremen. As in any language with a broad international character, often more than one correct term exists for a given concept (just as in English a certain car part is called a \"bonnet\" by British speakers but a \"hood\" by Americans). In Latin the existence of multiple synonyms is even more prevalent since the language has been in continuous use over a wide geographical area for over 2000 years. Sometimes the same concept is represented by different terms in classical, medieval, scientific and modern Latin. In general Vicipaedia adopts the oldest or classical term for the page name, with redirects from any others; major alternatives are listed in the article with footnote references. There is often lively debate among editors about shades of meaning. The practice of avoiding invented words and giving references for alternative terms agrees well with the general Wikipedia insistence on verifiability and the rule against original research. Many universities and other institutions have official Latin names. In fields where Latin is the current standard language, Vicipaedia normally adopts official names as pagenames, even if they belong to scientific or technical, rather than to classical Latin.

        "content": "Latin Wikipedia made it policy for all to follow the more widespread contemporary late 20th century orthographical habit of distinguishing u (pronounced as [u]) from v (pronounced as [w] in Classical Latin and as [v] in Ecclesiastical Latin) but not i (pronounced as [i]) from j (pronounced as [j] in both Classical and Ecclesiastical Latin). This orthographical practice was not without detractors, who claimed that it is a copy of the Italian spelling reform in which the i/j distinction is lost but the u/v distinction is maintained. The Latin Wikipedia logo reads \"VICIP\u00c6DIA\", displaying the \"\u00c6\". However, in accordance with contemporary practice, Vicipaedia does not use ligatures in its articles for the diphthongs written ae (\"\u00c6\", \"\u00e6\") and oe (\"\u0152\", \"\u0153\"), even though in Latin a diphthong like the ae in aes is pronounced differently from an hiatus like the ae in aer, both in the classical and even more so in the Italianate pronunciation. The ligatures were adopted by the Romans to save space, and \u00e6 and \u0153 in particular were later maintained by Latin typographers to distinguish the diphthong from the hiatus. Latin Wikipedia has chosen another convention, namely to write hiatus with the diaeresis: a\u00eb, o\u00eb. If Latin Wikipedia users prefer, however, they can activate a gadget under user preferences that automatically displays ae and oe without the diaeresis as ligatures on the pages. Latin Wikipedia, in common with the majority of modern printed Latin, does not require the marking of long vowels in words (in Latin textbooks this is usually done by adding a macron over a character, as for example, the e in st\u0113lla.) Thus, both terra and terr\u0101 are written simply as terra, although the former is in the nominative case, while the latter in the ablative. The context usually makes clear which one is being used. However, the use of macron or apex is allowed when distinction is necessary."

        "content": "Produced in 1966, Rondo was the first full-length film by former musician and screenwriter Zvonimir Berkovi\u0107, screenwriter of H-8, a famous Croatian 1950s classic. In both films, he uses musical form as a source for the narrative. As in Mozart's Rondo (which is repeatedly played in the soundtrack) in Berkovi\u0107's film the basic situation - Sunday afternoon chess party - is repeated with small variations, slowly bringing the three character towards a crisis. Very formal, very intimistic and set in a cosy middle-class environment, Rondo was very different from previous Yugoslav film tradition, introducing aesthetic of the modernist psychological novel into Croatian cinema."

An agent of a local pharmaceutical company meets the captain of the Soviet vessel and discusses the cargo, medical opium, which is in critical demand by the hospitals of the USSR. Soon after that the pharmaceutical company agent is seen inside a car, speaking to someone via walkie-talkie.  Later the MV Nezhin, with the opium on board, leaves port for Vladivostok. Some distance into the voyage, a watchman cries \"man overboard\" and the captain orders the engines stopped to rescue the stranded swimmer. The boat from Nezhin picks up an Asian man who identifies himself as Salekh, the only surviving sailor from a foreign merchant ship. Salekh told the crew that his ship suddenly capsized during a heavy storm and his crewmates were fighting for places in rescue boats. Shortly after that the Soviet captain is informed of an unknown ship, drifting nearby. The ship, called the Mercury, is apparently abandoned, with no crew visible and no activity on deck. The captain of the Nezhin decides to send four men to explore the ship and offer assistance to possible survivors. However, the abandoned ship turns out to be a trap for the Soviets. Occupied with the Mercury, none of the Russian crewmen pays any attention to Salekh, who takes an axe from the ship's firefighting kit, enters the radio room of the Nezhin, and attacks a radio operator, killing him. After Salekh destroys the ship's radio equipment, the Mercury starts her engines and approaches the Nezhin. At that moment, the Nezhin'''s crew see the bodies of the boarding party, floating in the water behind the Mercury. The Soviet captain realizes that his ship is under attack by pirates. Their attempt to escape is foiled when the Mercury rams the ship and the pirates open fire with assault rifles and machine guns. The pirates board the Nezhin, brutally killing Russian crewmembers who fight them. Sergey, the chief-mate of the Nezhin, discovers the dead radio operator and decides to find Salekh. Chasing Salekh through the corridors of the ship, Sergey makes an attempt to stop him. Salekh shows impressive martial arts skills and quickly defeats the chief-mate. Soon after, the pirates lock the remaining Russians into crew compartments and begin to offload the opium to the Mercury. The pirate captain thanks Salekh for a successful mission and orders him to blow up the Nezhin together with her crew. The Soviets, left to die on a sinking ship, manage to escape and must fight the pirates for survival."

It is published in 11 cities across Mexico, including Monterrey, Mexico City, Guadalajara, Le\u00f3n, Pachuca, Puebla, Villahermosa, Tampico, Torre\u00f3n, Toluca, and Xalapa. In each local edition they include local content and national news developed by the media group, not only from their newspaper reporters, but also from Multimedios Televisi\u00f3n and Multimedios Radio. It started in Monterrey as Diario de Monterrey, and expanded to other cities in the first decade of the 21st century. During elections, Milenio publishes the acclaimed Mar\u00eda de las Heras poll, that was the only poll in Mexico to predict the victory of Vicente Fox in 2000. The newspaper also publishes a biweekly magazine distributed nationwide, and operates the 24-hour news channel Milenio Televisi\u00f3n, which is distributed throughout Mexico via cable and satellite, and over-the-air in Multimedios's main region of Northern Mexico through subchannels of Multimedios Televisi\u00f3n. The newspaper was criticized for publishing a daily poll which gave President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto an 18-point lead over Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador 5 days before the election, while the real difference was 6.46%. Ciro G\u00f3mez Leyva printed a public apology, adding that they would \"retire from electoral polling.\""

The album vocals and acoustic guitars were recorded in a small recording studio in Salvador, where Veloso was confined for defying the authoritarian Brazilian government of the time. He recorded the vocals, and Gilberto Gil the acoustic guitar, which were sent to arranger and producer Rog\u00e9rio Duprat, who added layers of electric guitars, horns, bass, drums and other instruments in a more professional studio in S\u00e3o Paulo. The album, like its predecessor, is very eclectic (a characteristic of the Tropic\u00e1lia movement), with songs that vary from Bossa Nova, Psychedelic rock, Carnival music, traditional Bahian music, Fado, Tango, and others. It has songs in Portuguese, Spanish, and English. The song 'Alfomega' was sampled by MF DOOM on the Ghostface Killah track 'Charlie Brown' in 2006."

        "content": "Haratch ('Forward') () was an Armenian daily newspaper based in France. Haratch was founded in 1925 by Schavarch Missakian. The newspaper was famous for attracting high profile names in Armenian literature and journalism, including Shahan Shahnour, Schavarch Nartouni, Zareh Vorpuni, Hrach Zartarian, Nshan Beshiktashlian, and Hrant Samuel. After the migration of Armenians from the area of Musa Dagh (incorporated to Turkey in 1938) to Lebanon, who settled in the area of Anjar, Lebanon, in 1940, the initiative and efforts of editor Schavarch Missakian organized a contribution campaign among Armenians living in France. As a result, the \"Haratch\" Elementary School was built next to the newly established St. Paul church in the village. The school, officially opened in 1941, was considered a gift from the Armenians living in France. It was later renamed \"Haratch Calouste Gulbenkian Secondary School.\" Haratch ceased publication on 9 June 1940 because of the Nazi occupation of France and resumed publication on 8 April 1945 after the liberation of the country. On 26 January 1957, the founder of the paper, Schavarch Missakian, died, and his daughter Arpik Missakian assumed the responsibilities of publisher and editor-in-chief. In 1976 Haratch added a monthly supplement of literature and the arts, entitled Midk y\u00e8v Arvest (). Due to decreasing readership (circulation in the last years had fallen to less than one thousand copies), Arpik Missakian, owner and editor-in-chief, decided to close it down. The last issue (22,214) of \"Haratch\" was published with the date 30\u201331 May 2009. Five months after the demise of the daily, a new group of intellectuals started publishing Nor Haratch. The first issue of Nor Haratch was published on 27 October 2009. With its new, independent staff, administration and ownership, Nor Haratch should be considered a separate new publication, rather than a continuation of the original Haratch."

As a result, the movie bore almost no resemblance to the book besides the setting and several characters' names. History later repeated itself with another film by Sokurov Days of Eclipse (Dni zatmeniya).

It derives from the medieval personal name, of Biblical origin, from Aramaic \u05ea\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d0 t'om'a, a byname meaning 'twin'. It was borne by one of the disciples of Christ, best known for his skepticism about Christ's resurrection (John 20:24\u201329). The th- spelling in English results from the initial letter of the name in the Greek New Testament being a theta. The English pronunciation as t rather than a dental fricative is the result of French influence from an early date. In Britain, the surname is widely distributed throughout the country, but especially common in Cornwall and Wales. Thomas is the ninth most common surname in the United Kingdom. It is found as a personal name among Christians in India, and in the United States; it is also used as a family name among the Saint Thomas Christian families from Kerala, South India. In the 1990 United States Census, Thomas was the twelfth most common surname, accounting for 0.3% of the population. In France, Thomas (pronounced ) is the third most widespread surname after Martin and Bernard, with over 100,000 people with this name."

The album was recorded between August and December 2007 at Abbey Road Studios in London, and mixed in January and March 2008 at The Village Recorder in Los Angeles. Production was handled by Dave Sardy who had previously produced much of the group's sixth studio album, Don't Believe the Truth (2005). Lead guitarist Noel Gallagher wrote a majority of the songs, while three were written by Liam as well as one contribution each from Gem Archer and Andy Bell. The album was supported by three singles. The first single, \"The Shock of the Lightning\", was released shortly before the release of the album, on 29 September 2008. In addition to the standard release, there was also a limited edition boxset containing the album on CD, a bonus disc containing extra material and remixes, a DVD with a documentary of the making of the album, four 12\" vinyl discs that contained all the music from the CDs cut in high-quality 45rpm and a hardback book of album artwork. In promotion of the album, Oasis embarked on a world tour, debuting in Seattle at the WaMu Theater, and continuing for eighteen months. In 2009, the tour concluded (due to Noel Gallagher quitting the band) with major dates at some of the UK's biggest stadiums, notably the new Wembley Stadium, Sunderland's Stadium of Light and Edinburgh's Murrayfield. They also performed three hometown shows at Manchester's Heaton Park. Dig Out Your Soul received generally positive reviews from critics for its harder rock and psychedelic sound."

        "content": "In a January 2007 interview for NME, Noel Gallagher gave new details on his vision for the album: \"All the tunes I've written recently have been on the kind of acoustic side, you know? But for the next record I really fancy doing a record where we just completely throw the kitchen sink at it\", he explained. \"We haven't done that since Be Here Now. I'd like to get, like, a 100-piece orchestra and choirs and all that stuff. I think since Standing on the Shoulder of Giants we've been trying to prove a point of just bass, drums, guitar and vocals and nothing fancy. But I kind of like fancy! I'd like to make an absolutely fucking colossal album. You know? Like literally two orchestras, stuff like that.\" In October 2007, Noel revealed more about the record to BBC 6 Music: \"Funnily enough, we all write separately, but for some reason all the songs sound like they've got a common thread. We've been focusing round the grooves more this time, the last album was quite 'songy,' if that makes any sense, I don't know. But it was quite 'songy:' \"The Importance of Being Idle\", \"Let There Be Love\" \u2013 it was quite a British, retro, 60s sounding album. This is kinda focusing round the grooves more. Saying that, we've only done two tracks but all the demos that we've done are great.\" Noel also revealed details about his lyrics for his new songs: \"I've literally got nothing left to write about: I've wrote about being a youth, and I've wrote about being a rock star, and I've wrote about living life in the big city.  I've been re-visiting some of my more psychedelic trips of a younger man, because I remember them all you see...putting them to music.\" In a November 2007 interview with Reuters, singer Liam Gallagher revealed more details on how the record was going: \"All the songs are wrote (sic), this record's gonna be fuckin' rockin'. There's no acoustic on it, man. We rehearsed about 10 tunes before coming in. Three are mine. Some are Noel's, some are Gem's, some are Andy's. We're there for a long time, so we just keep pickin' em off the tree, man. Some are sounding really fucking heavy, and then we're picking some out, and you go, 'Well that doesn't sit with that, right.' So we just keep moving about. We've got plenty of songs. We're not gonna go bored.\"  Gallagher also revealed that the record,\"Will have everything thrown at it. Let's just hope that Noel's learnt his lesson in the studio this time!\" In a 15 June 2008 interview with talkSPORT, Noel said the album was \"colossal\", \"rockin'\" and added \"it's gonna sound great live, which is the most important thing.\" Between various songs on the album are several interludes (such as the sound of someone walking down a beach). Oasis have described these as \"bits inbetween\"."

        "content": "For the recording of Dig Out Your Soul, Oasis reunited with Don't Believe the Truth producer Dave Sardy at Abbey Road Studios in Westminster. Sessions began in July/August 2007 and concluded around Christmas with intermittent breaks. There was a brief period of confusion in which it seemed that Oasis would have had to forgo recording at Abbey Road due to U2 having reserved the recording areas that Oasis wished to use far in advance. The issue was resolved when Noel bought U2's spot in cash without the band's knowledge; this was possible due to the fact that the studios gave preference to cash payments over credit, which U2 had been booked with. Zak Starkey was made an official member during the sessions. The album art was created by artist Julian House. Ralph Steadman suggested the phrase \"Dig Out Your Soul\" for the album's title, a line in the song \"To Be Where There's Life\". According to Noel, \"We gave him [Steadman] the album, he listened to it and we gave him the lyrics\u2026 He came back with a list of titles and one of them was Dig Out Your Soul. Noel's only instruction was \"As long as we don\u2019t call it Oasis I don\u2019t give a fuck\". Mixing took place in Los Angeles, and was slowed by constant equipment failure. After the album was completed and the band began discussions with several record companies with which to release it. In August 2008, Reprise Records announced that it would distribute Dig Out Your Soul in North America. The songs \"(I Wanna Live in a Dream in My) Record Machine\" and \"Come on Outside\" were planned to be on Dig Out Your Soul, but were ultimately left off as according to Noel, Liam \"ran out of time\" to record them."

        "content": "Critical reception of the album was generally positive, with a score of 66/100 on Metacritic. Many critics lauded Dig Out Your Soul as one of the strongest albums ever recorded by the band, and noted that \"it seems Oasis have made something that can happily play alongside Morning Glory.\" Jonathan Cohen of Billboard says that with Dig Out Your Soul, the group \"Gets back to its stripped-down rock roots\" and that the opening song, \"Bag It Up\" harks back to Definitely Maybe'''s \"Columbia\". Luke Bainbridge of The Observer gave the album 4 stars out of 5, saying \"You could say that if Definitely Maybe was their Stone Roses, Dig Out Your Soul is their Second Coming. It won't win them any new fans, but those that believed the truth last time will dig this.\" Not all reviews have been positive, however; Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone magazine gave the album a 2\u00bd out of 5 stars. Rosen said of the new album that, \"Dig Out Your Soul is an almost comically generic Oasis release, from its preponderance of plodding midtempo rockers (\"Bag It Up\", \"Waiting for the Rapture\") to the vaguely Indian raga-flavored psychedelic anthems (\"To Be Where There's Life\").\" In the UK, the album sold 90,000 copies on its first day of release, making it the second fastest selling album of 2008, behind Coldplay's Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends. It debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 1, with first week sales of 200,866 copies, making it the 51st fastest selling album ever in the UK. The album debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200 in the US, with 53,000 copies sold.  It is the highest chart position of any Oasis album in the US since 1997's Be Here Now which debuted at number 2, but fewer total opening week sales than Don't Believe the Truth. It has spent a total of 32 weeks in the French Albums Chart, the most ever by any Oasis album."

        "content": "\"Born to be Abramo?\" is a sample from a contemporary advertisement for \"Ava\" laundry detergent, where Claudia Mori sang a reference to \"La terra dei cachi\" on a different melody, possibly for copyright reasons. The sample is interrupted by a loud scream from the band members. \"Born to be Abramo\" is a re-recording of the band's banned 1990 single, featuring guest Patrick Hernandez singing a parody of his own hit \"Born to Be Alive\" on religious-themed Italian lyrics by missionary Gigi Cocquio. \"L'astronauta pasticcione\" (\"The bungling astronaut\"), the first of two previously unreleased songs on the album, is a ballad about a very inept astronaut who gets sick with diarrhea as a result of space travel and ends up releasing his feces into his space suit, causing a horribly unbearable smell. The song, however, describes the event in a very sweet, almost poetical way. On a musical level, the song's chorus uses the chords from the 1975 song \"Lighthouse\" by James Taylor, as well as a reference to \"Squonk\" (1976) by Genesis. \"Introservi\" is a ballad-like intro to the following track, \"Servi della gleba\", already released as a ghost track on \u0130talyan, rum casusu \u00e7ikti. \"Servi della gleba\", \"Tapparella\", \"Pipppero\" and \"Burattino senza fichi\" are all identical to the respective versions on the band's past albums. \"La terra dei cachi\" is the studio version of the song, previously available only on a promo single. The band's live performance of the song at the 1996 Sanremo Music Festival was released on Eat the Phikis. \"L'eterna lotta tra il bene e il male\" (\"The eternal fight between good and evil\"), the second previously unreleased song on the album, uses the backing track to the 1995 song \"Very Good Very Bad\", from the Bollywood film Trimurti, overlaid with multiple samples from a series of angry, offending and profane voicemails left on keyboard player Sergio Conforti's answering machine by an anonymous elderly lady from Milan, nicknamed \"Nasty sciura\" (\"sciura\" being Milanese for \"lady\") by Conforti (a.k.a. Rocco Tanica) - who apparently mistook him for the band's lead singer. In the voicemails, \"Nasty sciura\" repeatedly insults Conforti about the recurring use of vulgarity in the band's songs, accusing him (among other things) of having mentally corrupted her son. This track also includes a few lines sung by Elio on a melody from \"Within You, Without You\" by The Beatles. \"Abitudinario\", \"Supergiovane\" and \"John Holmes\" are new recordings of the respective songs, with small alterations (mostly consisting in slight changes to the performances and the samples used on the tracks). \"Cara ti amo\" is a completely new recording of the same-titled song, a surreal dialogue between two lovers, from Elio samaga hukapan kariyana turu. It is purported to be live but it was actually made in a studio, as the purported location of the live recording, \"Baritone Women's Bar in Prugliasco, Switzerland\", is invented - although \"Planet of the Baritone Women\" is a track from Frank Zappa's 1988 live album Broadway the Hard Way. As on the previous album version, the dialogue (performed by Elio and Tanica) is almost completely improvised. \"Alfieri\" (\"Ensigns\") is the only officially available version, recorded live in 1986 in a Legnano club, of the band's concluding song from their 1980s/early 1990s live shows, where, after a semi-serious verse by Elio, each band member introduces himself in a comedic verse, before ending with an equally comedic unison choir. On this particular recording, bassist Nicola Fasani (a.k.a. Faso or Pasto) and guitarist Davide Civaschi (a.k.a. Ces\u00e0reo) are heard laughing throughout their verses (because the other members are teasing them and playing practical jokes to them) and barely managing to sing their lyrics. \"Sos epidos\" (\"The debts\" in Sardinian) is a satirical song about debts, sung in the local language by a group of Sardinian tenores."

(In 1997 the latest volume in Mina's series, released in 1987, was Volume 9.)

According to a statement by Elio during an episode of Cordialmente (the band's own radio show on Radio Deejay), broadcast at the time, the photo actually depicts two males, although the reliability of such a statement is debatable."

Some of the songs of this album have been recorded in different languages by Mina during the 1970s. \"Non tornare pi\u00f9\" was covered and released in French (\"Les oiseaux reviennent\") in a 1974 45rpm (in 1998, it was published in a French album compilation, Quand ma voix te touche). \"Devo tornare a casa mia\" was covered in 1975 in Spanish, \"Debo volver ya con los mios\", as well as \"Questo s\u00ec, questo no\" (\"Esto s\u00ec, esto no\"). \"Domenica sera\" has three different versions: in Spanish (\"Domingo a la noche\"), in German (\"Die Liebe am Sonntag\") and in English (\"Don't Ask Me To Love You\"). The hit \"E poi...\" was recorded in other four languages: English (\"Runaway\"), Spanish (\"\u00bfY que?\"\"), french (\"Et puis \u00e7a sert \u00e0 quoi\") and German (\"Und dann\"). There are also two other Italian versions of the same song: in the live album Mina Live '78 and in 1992 album Sorelle Lumi\u00e8re, in which the song was mixed with Riccardo Cocciante's hit \"Un nuovo amico\". All the songs were released on 45rpm records or in unofficial album compilations."

        "content": "Hermann, an ethnic German, is an officer of the engineers in the Imperial Russian Army. He constantly watches the other officers gamble, but never plays himself. One night, Tomsky tells a story about his grandmother, an elderly countess. Many years ago, in France, she lost a fortune at faro, and then won it back with the secret of the three winning cards, which she learned from the notorious Count of St. Germain. Hermann becomes obsessed with obtaining the secret. The countess (who is now 87 years old) has a young ward, Lizavyeta Ivanovna. Hermann sends love letters to Lizavyeta, and persuades her to let him into the house. There Hermann accosts the countess, demanding the secret. She first tells him that story was a joke, but Hermann refuses to believe her. He repeats his demands, but she does not speak. He draws a pistol and threatens her, and the old lady dies of fright. Hermann then flees to the apartment of Lizavyeta in the same building. There he confesses to frightening the countess to death with his pistol. He defends himself by saying that the pistol was not loaded. He escapes from the house with the aid of Lizavyeta, who is disgusted to learn that his professions of love were a mask for greed. Hermann attends the funeral of the countess, and is terrified to see the countess open her eyes in the coffin and look at him. Later that night, the ghost of the countess appears. The ghost names the secret three cards (three, seven, ace), tells him he must play just once each night and then orders him to marry Lizavyeta. Hermann takes his entire savings to Chekalinsky's salon, where wealthy men gamble at faro for high stakes. On the first night, he bets it all on the three and wins. On the second night, he wins on the seven. On the third night, he bets on the ace\u2014but when cards are shown, he finds he has bet on the Queen of Spades, rather than the ace, and loses everything. When the Queen appears to wink at him, he is astonished by her remarkable resemblance to the old countess, and flees in terror. In a short conclusion, Pushkin writes that Lizavyeta marries the son of the Countess' former steward, a state official who makes a good salary. Hermann, however, goes mad and is committed to an asylum. He is installed in Room 17 at the Obukhov hospital; he answers no questions, but merely mutters with unusual rapidity: \"Three, seven, ace! Three, seven, queen!\""

        "title": "The Queen of Spades (story)_Inspiration",
        "content": "The character of the old countess was inspired by Princess Natalya Petrovna Golitsyna, who served as the lady-in-waiting for five Russian emperors and was 92 at the time Pushkin wrote \"The Queen of Spades\". According to a legend, Golitsyna had been a successful gambler. When her grandson lost a considerable amount of money playing cards and came to her to beg her for money, Golitsyna instead revealed to him the secret three cards that Count Saint-Germain showed to her in Paris. However, while the Countess died in the story, Golitsyna outlived Pushkin and reached the age of 97. Critics have argued that the Count Saint-Germain holds historical importance in the story. Saint-Germain serves as the namesake for the story's protagonist, Hermann. Beyond this, the historical Saint-Germain may represent a father figure for Hermann, the antithesis to Hermann's character, or a former love interest of the countess who seeks revenge for her death by causing Hermann to pick the wrong cards. The card game of faro also plays an important role in Pushkin's story. The game is played by having a player bet on a winning card. The dealer then begins turning over cards, burning the first (known as \"soda\") to his left. The second card is placed face up to his right; this is the first winning card. The third card is placed face up in the left pile, as a losing card. The dealer continues turning over cards, alternating piles until the bet has been won or lost."

        "title": "The Queen of Spades (story)_Reality vs. the supernatural",
        "content": "According to Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Pushkin\u2019s tale represents \u201cthe pinnacle of the art of the fantastic\u201d. While readers may think that the vision of the Countess that appears to Hermann was merely an apparition, at the end of the story, Pushkin has still given no definitive answer. Readers must decide whether the countess appeared only to Hermann in his mind, a realistic solution, or whether Hermann has entered the world of the supernatural. Critics have attempted to answer this question using a variety of cryptographic clues within the text. These critics focus on three elements: the origin of the three, seven and ace; whether Hermann could have identified the cards without the ghost\u2019s intervention, and possible explanations for Hermann\u2019s mistake with the last card. Different critics have presented contradicting supernatural or rational views of Hermann\u2019s final mistake. The critic Gary Rosenshield claims that, by making the wrong choice of cards, Hermann actually did the right thing: as a man obsessed with gambling, having won the money would have meant that he could never gamble again, and therefore would have never again lived. Other critics with rational explanations, such as Nathan Rosen and Viktor Vonogradov, claim that Hermann may have simply seen a likeness between the Countess who gave him the secret and the Queen card, leading him to make a mistake. This explanation focuses on Pushkin\u2019s quote in the story that \u201cTwo fixed ideas can no more exist together in the moral world than two bodies can occupy one and the same place in the physical world.\u201d Here, Hermann cannot separate the actual cards from the Countess who reveals them to him, leading him to accidentally choose the queen instead of an ace. In contrast to these rational explanations, other critics claim that Hermann entered the world of the supernatural and that the card actually changed after Hermann had picked it. These explanations argue that the Countess sought revenge on Hermann for her death. Critic Sergei Davydov argues that, since the Countess doubted that Hermann would indeed marry Lizavyeta\u2014a concession he had made to acquire the secret\u2014her ghost caused a magical transformation of the cards that led to Hermann\u2019s downfall."

        "content": "Pushkin's tale is considered to be a work about \"telling stories\". Hermann, who is an author within the context of the story, in a way attempts to author his own fate by setting up a gambling situation in which he is guaranteed to win. Hermann's motivations to set up the scenario also come primarily from gossip, or word of mouth from his acquaintances. It is as if he is set within a story told by others, and feels inspired to write his own. A reading of The Queen of Spades holds that the story reveals the Russian stereotype of the German, one who is cold and calculating person bent on accumulating wealth."

In the story, Hermann becomes obsessed by gambling, even before the Countess grants him her secret to the cards. According to critic Nathan Rosen, Hermann\u2019s fatal mistake at the end of the story constitutes an act of self-punishment: Hermann punishes himself for the avarice of his corrupted soul. Beyond this greed in the form of his gambling obsession, Hermann\u2019s avarice manifests itself in his dealings with Lizavyeta and the Countess. From the moment when he first sets eye on her, Hermann manipulates Lizaveta and her \u201cinjured innocence\u201d to gain access to the Countess and the gambling secrets she holds; however, Hermann\u2019s \u201cdepravity becomes fully manifest in the climactic bedroom scene\u201d when he trespasses into the Countess\u2019 room and causes her death."

These metapoetic moments refer to the story dealing with stories internally. One of the clearest example of this takes place after Hermann\u2019s encounter with the countess\u2019 ghostly form. After her departure, Hermann immediately writes down his vision, recording it on paper and writing a small story within the larger story of The Queen of Spades. A second example is when Tomsky and his grandmother talk about traditional plot lines within a Russian novel, of which his grandmother denies the existence."

Conjunctively, the Vibal Foundation (per Gaspar Vibal and his mother) made a historical move in Philippine education, when it also launched on June 12, 2008, the 110th Philippine Declaration of Independence day, e-turo.org, as conduit of these 3 landmark education tools. Tin Mandigma, editor-in-chief of E-turo.org explained that it is an e-learning portal which \"seeks to provide free and quality learning materials online to teachers and students; it gives teachers access to lesson plans and modules based on textbook materials published by Vibal Publishing House, Inc. amid plans to offer Department of Education-approved content from various learning institutions as supplementary teaching materials. One of the most common complaints of teachers is that while the Internet has so much information, most of it cannot be adapted to the local classroom. With this project, we hope to help teachers sort through the clutter and give them quality information that would be useful for their students.\""

The site initially used the Plone content management system the production of articles was deemed too slow under the system. In September 2006, plans to shift the system to use the wiki-model were conceived (after the founding of Filipiniana.net) by its New York-based founder Gaspar Vibal and webmaster Richard Grimaldo. Octogenarian book publisher Esther A. Vibal, founder of Vibal Publishing House, Inc. (VPHI), and mother of Gaspar Vibal learned about online publishing and knowledge sharing. She introduced the concepts through Gaspar's Filipiniana.net and WikiPilipinas.org, the world's biggest Philippine encyclopedia available on the Web. The actual conceptualization of WikiPilipinas (then-Wikipiniana) occurred in February 2007. In planning, MediaWiki was officially selected to be the site's platform and it was decided that the site were to be modeled after the Wikipedia. Instead of a complete fork of Wikipedia however, Wikipiniana was to be a \"hipper\" and \"freer\" version, including almanac lists and directories. The WikiPilipinas team, headed by Grimaldo as webmaster and Alfred Ursua as its managing editor, drew up an initial masterlist of priority contents for Project Wikipiniana. The project officially began on March 15, 2007. It was first made available online three months after on June 12 to coincide with the country's official Independence Day. A month after going live, the official name of the service was changed from Wikipiniana to WikiPilipinas on July 7. WikiPhilippines was the term decided upon for the section of the site with articles in English and WikiFilipinas for the section in Spanish. A press-oriented sneak preview of the site was hosted for the local media on August 22 of the same year. The event was attended by major Philippine media outlets such as GMA-7 and RPN-9, print media like the Manila Bulletin, the Philippine Daily Inquirer, and the Manila Times and dozens of Philippine bloggers. In a press release on August 23, the site's publicists claimed to be \"the fastest online startup in Philippine history\" due to the site receiving 100,000 visitors during the slew of accesses that occurred after the site was covered by the media the previous day. WikiPilipinas had its official launch during the 28th Manila International Book Fair in late August 2007. The project itself is owned by the Vibal Foundation, which bills itself as the \"corporate social arm\" of Vibal Publishing House.

Many of its observers on the blogging community and Tambayan Philippines, the Philippine Wikipedia regional notice board, have observed that it is \"trying to be everything all at once: magazine, putative encyclopedia, pluralistic community forum, soapbox-for-a-day, rumor rag, fight club. It is a pastische of different entities, each of which has been successful on its own, but it remains to be seen whether they will be as successful when smashed together. It is less an organic fusion as it is an unnatural pile-up of knowledge-sharing methodologies taken from Euro-America. In many ways, it is symptomatic and representative of the Philippine condition.\" Upon learning of its inception, a few Filipino bloggers questioned the usefulness of WikiPilipinas as a fork of Wikipedia. In a post entitled \"Is There Any Point to Wikipiniana?\", a Filipino blogger weighed the pros and cons of having an encyclopedia administered to entirely by Filipinos. Filipino blogger and Wikipedian Eugene Alvin Villar questioned the usefulness and purpose of WikiPilipinas in a blog post on July 19, 2007. He argued that the \"hip and free encyclopedia\"'s policy on articles not needing to adhere to a neutral point of view (as Wikipedia does) was not conducive to an unbiased encyclopedia. With WikiPilipinas being marketed as an encyclopedia \"by Filipinos, for Filipinos,\" Villar pointed out the great possibility of bias in the encyclopedia's articles. Aside from the possibility of bias, he also mentioned that the articles of WikiPilipinas were less likely to rank higher than those of the English Wikipedia in web searches, making effort spent in updating WikiPilipinas articles better spent working on their equivalent Wikipedia articles. He later reiterated some of these concerns in an interview with the Manila Bulletin in September. In the interview, he criticized WikiPilipinas for prioritizing publicity over streamlining the site's policies and guidelines. Notable Filipino blogger Abraham Olandres personally mentioned Villar's criticism of WikiPilipinas. In his post, Olandres agreed that the Filipino-based service would be useless and redundant unless it \"came up with its own set of content\". In a later entry, Olandres pointed out that WikiPilipinas' lack of a notability guideline could possibly slant it towards a Filipino-centric sense of pseudo-notability. Kristine Mandigma, the president of the Philippine literacy advocacy group Read-or-Die Foundation, also made a commentary on WikiPilipinas after attending the service's August 22 official press launch. She described WikiPilipinas as \"the online version of an omnium gatherum\u2026 a motley and captivating assortment of ideas, facts and factoids, emotions, dissertations, and agonized biographies.\" The site's credibility was questioned in line with a possible connection to Vibal Publishing House, a local publishing service that was implicated in a controversial textbook scandal. Both the publishing company and WikiPilipinas are owned by the same person, Gaspar Vibal. In an interview with the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Vibal asserted that the wiki project and the publishing house were independent of each other."

        "content": "The protagonist of the film, the Wizard (Oleg Yankovsky), invents a fairy tale to amuse himself and his wife (Irina Kupchenko). The tale's characters come to life, come to his house and set out to live their lives. Many years ago, the Wizard came up with a \"reverse\" fairy tale, turning a bear into a human (Aleksandr Abdulov), who would transform back into a bear as soon as a princess falls in love with him and kisses him. Now, the young man returns to the Wizard's house where he meets a beautiful girl (Yevgeniya Simonova), and they immediately fall in love with each other. To his dismay, she turns out to be a princess \u2013 the Wizard made it so that a king (Yevgeny Leonov) who was just passing by with his daughter and his suite felt a sudden urge to stop by the estate. When the Princess, clueless about the young man's origin, wants to kiss him, he flees in horror. The Princess hurries after him, dressed as a boy. They meet in a tavern called \"Emilia\", but the Bear, unable to recognize the Princess, summons her to a duel. However, when the Princess cries out \"Daddy\" during the battle, the Bear realizes that she deceived him. In anger, he goes to the innkeeper (Yury Solomin) and begs to be to locked up, as the tavern is covered with snow and it is impossible to get out. The innkeeper gives him the key to a room. He draws his attention to one of the court ladies and recognizes in her his first love Emilia, in whose honor he named the inn. The innkeeper and Emilia decide to help the quarreled lovers. The Princess locks herself in a room on the second floor of the inn and promises to shoot anyone who would come to her. The King orders to draw lots and the lot comes out for the court Minister Administrator (Andrei Mironov). The Administrator comes to the Princess, and a shot rings out \u2013 leaving behind the Princess, the administrator shoots her, but misses. The Princess angrily decides to marry the first courter and announces the Administrator to be her fianc\u00e9. The King decides to play a wedding. Desperate, his love taken away from him, the Bear decides to tell all about the princess kiss that would turn him into a beast, but the Princess rejects him. The wedding procession leaves. The Hunter (Vsevolod Larionov) and the Bear remain in the tavern. The Wizard appears and tells the Bear that he was disappointed in his behavior. He calls the Bear a coward. In the opinion of the Wizard the Bear should have kissed the princess. The fact that he didn't do that shows that he does not love the princess so much as to sacrifice his human form. The Bear and the Hunter make an agreement under which, if ever the Bear is to kiss the Princess and to turn into an animal, the Hunter will kill him. Exactly one year passes by. The country is actually ruled by the Administrator instead of the King. The Princess is slowly dying of longing for the Bear. The Wizard intentionally does not let the Bear in the country and into his house, because he thinks that the tale with a sad end has much more to teach people, and stories with a happy ending are just for children. As the Princess feels death coming, the Bear appears in the house of the Wizard. The Hunter is aiming the gun at the Bear. The Bear kisses the princess, but does not turn into a bear, and stays a man. The Wizard explains this paradox to be an ordinary miracle. The characters leave the Wizard's house that turns out to be all scenery. The decorations burn and the Wizard is left alone."

        "title": "Geoffrey (name)_Summary",
        "content": "Geoffrey is an English and French masculine given name. It is generally considered the Anglo-Norman form of the Germanic compound  'god' and  'peace'. It is a cognate of Dutch Godfried, German Gottfried and Old English Gotfrith and Godfrith. Alexander MacBain considered it as being found in the Gaelic and Welsh forms; potentially before or contemporary to the Anglo-Saxon, with the examples of Goraidh, Middle Gaelic Gofraig (1467 MS.), Godfrey (do.), Irish Gofraidh (F.M.), Middle Irish Gothfrith, Gofraig (Tigernach, 989), Early Irish Gothfraid (Lib. Lein.), E. Welsh Gothrit (Ann. Camb.). Macbain suggested these Celtic forms of the name were closer related to the Anglo-Saxon Godefrid than the Norse Go\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r, Gudr\u00f8d or G\u00f3r\u00f6\u00f0r; however he does not elaborate further on the origin or relation. The form as 'Geoffrey' was probably introduced to Norman England. It was also Anglicised as Jeffrey later after the name became more popular after the likes of President Jefferson. Popularity of the name declined after the medieval period, but it was revived in modern England and the British Empire at large. Modern hypocorisms include  Geoff or Jeff. Jeffrey and its variants are found as surnames, usually ending in -s (e.g. Jefferies, Jaffrays); The surname Jefferson is also a patronymic version of the given name."

        "title": "Geoffrey (name)_Etymology",
        "content": "The Old French form of the name was Geoffrei ([d\u0292\u0254frej]), which developed into West Middle French Geoffrey and East Middle French Geoffroy. Latinised forms include Jotfredus, Jozsfredus, Josfredus (10th century) and Jof[f]redus, Jofridus, Jaufredus, Geffredus (11th century). The original spelling with Jo- was modified in Geo-. The graphic e after G is used in French to avoid the pronunciation [go], but [\u0292\u0254] instead.  The spelling Geo- is probably due to the influence of the first name Georges, derived from Old French Jorre, Joire. The Old Frankish name Godefrid itself is from the Germanic elements god- and frid-. The Middle Latin form is Godefridus (whence also Godfrey).  The second element is widely used in Germanic names, and has a meaning of \"peace, protection\". The first element god- is conflated from two, or possibly three, distinct roots, ie got and possibly *gaut, in origin a tribal name (Geats, Goths) or a theonym (a  byname of Wotan). Albert Dauzat (1951, rev. ed. 1980) followed by others, argued that the Middle French name Geoffrey in fact retains a distinction between two Germanic names which became conflated in the Middle Ages. According to this argument, Godfrey continues *goda-fri\u00feu-, while Geoffroy continues *gaut-fri\u00feu-. If a strictly phonetic development is assumed, Geoffrey cannot be derived from Godfrid, as *go- would result in Old French go- ([g\u0254]) and not geo- (jo-, [d\u0292\u0254]), ie goda-fridu would yield Godefroy [godfrwa] but not Geoffroy. On the other hand, *gau-  [gaw] would regularly result in  jo- (geo- [d\u0292\u0254]), i.e *gaut-fridu- would regularly result in Geoffroy [d\u0292\u0254f:rwa]. Alternative suggestions which would derive the first element from Germanic  gisal- 'hostage',  or w(e)alah 'Gallo-Roman; stranger' are also rejected by Dauzat as phonetically impossible: gi would have resulted in Old French [d\u0292i] (Modern French [\u0292i]), as in Gisalbert > Gilbert (ie *Gisalfrid > *Giffrey), and  *w(e)alh- would have resulted in *gaul- [gol] (ie *Wealhfrid > *Gaulfrey, *Gauffrey)."

Revaux was dissatisfied and visited Fran\u00e7ois at Dannemois on 27 August 1967 proposing to rework the song for him.  Fran\u00e7ois accepted but asked that an underlying theme of a couple in a strained relationship be included, in reference to his recent breakup with fellow French singer France Gall. Revaux agreed and with some rewriting from Gilles Thibaut the song became \"Comme d'habitude\" in its best-known version in French, which was released by Claude Fran\u00e7ois in 1967."

Rachid Taha, Khaled and Faudel, three French-Algerian artists sang it live in Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy. The live version produced and arranged by Steve Hillage, was included in joint Taha / Khaled / Faudel live album 1, 2, 3 Soleils was released by Barclay in 1999 reaching No. 4 in French Albums Chart and No. 14 in Belgium's French (Wallonia) Albums Chart. The cover of \"Comme d'habitude\" found on the album as performed by the trio proved very popular and was released in 1999 as a single in France and it reached No. 40 on both SNEP, the official French Singles Chart and on Belgium's French Wallonia Singles Chart.

The lyrics of \"My Way\" are similar to those of \"Comme d'habitude\" in terms of structure and metre, but the meaning is completely different. The French song is about routine in a relationship that is falling out of love, while the English language version is set at the end of a lifetime, approaching death, and looking back without regret \u2013 expressing feelings that are more related to Edith Piaf's song \"Non, je ne regrette rien\"."

However, due to the huge success of the single \"Les Mots\", recorded as duet with Seal, the new single was not released until April 2002. The promotional CD single was sent to radio stations on 4 March 2002, then the promotional vinyl on 28 March 2002. There were three versions of the CD single : one is supple, the second is thick, the third is a picture disc. Several remixes were produced on the three media (CD single, CD maxi, 12\" maxi): 'elegie's club remix ', by Blue Planet Corporation, 'such a beautiful day's remix' and 'beauty and bed remix', by StarCity, 'what a souci's remix', by Tom Novy. Another remix was only available on the German Promotional CD single, 'elegie's remix club radio edit', also by Blue Planet Corporation. In 2004, a new remix was made by Devis Head, engineered by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Devoise at Studio Guillaume Tell, in Paris. Two other maxi CDs were released in Germany and Canada, with the same track listings as the French one, but with a crystal case. The promotional CD contains two white feathers : one on the cover (at the end of the word \"journ\u00e9e\"), the other inside. The photography was directed by Ellen von Unwerth, and the cover design was made by Henry Neu. As for her other singles, Myl\u00e8ne Farmer wrote the lyrics and Laurent Boutonnat composed the music. About the lyrics, Farmer, interviewed by TF1, confessed to have changed the words of the chorus afterthought. Initially, \"C'est une belle journ\u00e9e, je vais me tuer\", which could be taken as an incitement to suicide by vulnerable people, was replaced in the end with \"C'est une belle journ\u00e9e, je vais me coucher\". Jean-Claude D\u00e9qu\u00e9ant, who composed \"Libertine\" for Farmer in 1986, said he had \"great admiration\" for \"C'est une belle journ\u00e9e\"."

        "content": "In this song, Farmer talks about \"her irresistible need to see the bad side of things, contrary to most people\". This song is very similar in its structure to \"Je t'aime m\u00e9lancolie\" : indeed, the two songs have heavy dance sounds and deal with the same gloomy themes. Concerning the lyrics, death and religious references are present, including the angels in the refrain. Expert of French charts \u00c9lia Habib considered that \"C'est une belle journ\u00e9e\" \"has an intro worthy of a 1980s opus of Pet Shop Boys\" and said it \"is a song with a tempo surprisingly cheerful\"; however, he maintained: \"Under this cover unusual are concealed again recurring themes of the Farmer anthology: death, nostalgia, vision of a world torn between good and evil, brevity of life\". To author Erwan Chuberre, \"C'est une belle journ\u00e9e\" is \"a catchy and joyful song at the first hearing but that turns out to be, finally, rather dark\", and has \"a lot of irony and humor\". According to French magazine Instant-Mag, \"we find [in this song] all Farmer and Boutonnat's art of the beautiful time, namely involve very delicately melancholy lyrics and skipping music, or even a bit commercial\". \"Apology of suicide, sleep, pessimism, departure\", the song is \"a call to sacrifice, to let go, to flee to a world of spiritual and physical peace\". \"Behind the joyful and optimistic notes of the song, we can perceive stenchs much less happy and much more ambiguous. Farmer is in a pessimistic perspective, referring to the death behind the apparent sleep, the emptiness instead of the full, the completion instead of the beginning, and the flight as a reunion.\" There is also a parallel with Le Dormeur du val, written by French poet Arthur Rimbaud. About the lyrics, Farmer said: \"It would be indecent to directly address the topic of suicide. Too easy. Because I am protected by my family circle, by this success that gives me some strength. Those who listen to me do not always have them, that security.\" However, as noted by psychologist Hugues Royer, suicide evoked in the lyrics is intended to relieve a too heavy sadness, but to avoid, paradoxically, the horizon of a possible happiness."

There are also rumors about the fact that the video would be produced from the singer's drawings \u2013 and that was right -, as it had done for the CD maxi and vinyl's covers for \"Dessine-moi un mouton\". Finally, for the first time in the star's career, the video, directed by Beno\u00eet Di Sabatino, was produced as a cartoon film. Shot in Paris, it cost about 120,000 euros. As always, it was a Requiem Publishing and Stuffed Monkey production, and the screenplay was written by Farmer. The music video was announced in the media. In addition to Farmer, the video features a young girl, Lisa, who has already appeared on the cover of the second Marc Levy novel, O\u00f9 es-tu ?, a sheep already seen on \"Dessine-moi un mouton\"'s cover, a spider (initially created for the program of the 1996 concert tour) and a rat, in a childish style. There are several references to Le Petit Prince, a 1943 Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry novella. At the beginning of the video, we see a dead tree and leaves flying. A slender young woman (Farmer) begins the day doing some stretches on her bed. Inadvertently, she kicks her sheep and looks for it around her. Then while she is bathing, a spider appears in a phylactery. The sheep eats the soap, hiccups, finds itself in a bubble and falls in the bathtub. Then, at noon, Farmer encloses the sheep in her refrigerator. She sits on it and swings her legs to the rhythm of the clock's hands which go round very quickly. Farmer then juggles with her frozen sheep. In the afternoon, she goes and sits on her bed, plays with a spider and seems to be very sad. Suddenly, a young boy appears at the door, hung by his feet. He plays with a ball and flies to the dead tree. Farmer looks at him for a while, and eventually follows him. There the boy dances and plays leapfrog. The sheep, a car and some words fly at their turn. At the end of the day, Farmer lies down with the sheep and the video ends with a mention \"To be continued\". According to some analyses, the video emphasizes melancholy and nostalgia. In this context, the dead tree could illustrate the faded beauty of the world, the spider would be the personification of the singer's black thoughts, while the sheep would represent Farmer's lost dreams and deepest disillusionment. The clock's hands going round quickly are likely to illustrate the time gap between physical and mental time. As for the little girl, she would represent Farmer when she was younger and carefree. However, the final words leave a glimmer of hope. The fact that the child was hung by the feet at a certain time might refer to \u0152dipus, but also to Farmer's song \"Jardin de Vienne\" in which a child finds freedom by hanging."

        "content": "Farmer performed the song in playback in two television programs: first, Farmer sang \"C'est une belle journ\u00e9e\" on 27 April on the nationally acclaimed show Hit Machine on M6; then, she performed the song on Zidane Ela, broadcast on France 2 on 19 May. For the first and only time, she appeared in the trailer, announcing her own performance in the broadcast (the fact that the singer sang that day for a humanitarian cause may have been a factor). At the end of the song, feathers were released on the set. As noted by Instant-Mag, these performances were conducted with a great deal of relaxation. The choreography, \"fluid, joyful\" and carried out with two female dancers, \"was much less ceremonial than that of \"L'\u00c2me-stram-gram\"\", and Farmer was smiling more than usual. At each performance, she wore a hat on her head. The song was performed during the 2006 tour. When the song started, the letters CUBJ (the acronym of \"C'est une belle journ\u00e9e\"), then drawings from the music video, appeared on giant screens in the back of the stage. Farmer and her dancers performed an original and dynamic choreography, then the singer approached the audience and sat down. It was also performed on the Timeless tour in 2013. In 2003, the single was covered by French singers MC Solaar, Alain Souchon and Jean-Louis Aubert, during the Les Enfoir\u00e9s tour. Their version is available on the album La Foire aux Enfoir\u00e9s."

The song was released on 29 July 1991 and was the second single from her third studio album L'Autre.... The music video was shot in a cemetery in Budapest, as the song deals with a love relationship between two people separated by the death of one of them.

        "content": "\"Regrets\" was Farmer's first duet and was scheduled as the second single from the album L'Autre... since the release of \"D\u00e9senchant\u00e9e\". According to Farmer, the song was \"very long to write\". The idea of the duet started from an \"irregular but faithful\" correspondence through letters between both singers for a year. Murat explained: \"One day, in the box of letters, I have a letter of Myl\u00e8ne. She is asking me if I want to sing with her. This letter is not a legend, I received by the post, simply. I do not believe my eyes, she gives me her phone number.\" Finally Murat called her and they met in Paris. Already in 1989, Farmer confessed that she liked Murat's songs and his album Cheyenne Automne, and his way of writing. Thus, according to Murat, Farmer had the idea to record a duet with him, and he accepted after listening to an audiotape of \"Regrets\" in which Farmer sang the two voices \u2013 her own and that of Murat trying to make it deeper \u2014  which French author Julien Rigal deemed a \"legend\". At that time, Farmer said in several interviews that she considered Murat as her \"brother\", her \"double\", her \"twin\" and a \"poet\"; she called her encounter with Murat \"fantastic\". In the media, Murat said almost the same thing on this matter and on other ones, so much so that the OK magazine established a comparison of the previous interviews given in the press by both singers. However, as noted by author Erwan Chuberre, it remains impossible to really know if the duet was actually motivated by a genuine friendship or by a business strategy, given that the singers wanted to expand their fans base then. In 2004, Murat said in the French newspaper L'Express that \"Regrets\" helped him to launch his career. The single was released on 29 July 1991 under various formats, including a CD maxi with a pin's in a limited edition. In 2000, the recording company scheduled to release the live version of \"Regrets\" as the second single from the album Mylenium Tour, and thus sent a promotional VHS to the radio stations. However, given the differences with Farmer who preferred \"Pas le temps de vivre\" as single and the disappointing sales of the previous live singles \"Ainsi soit je...\" and \"Dessine-moi un mouton\", the song was finally not released."

Indeed, Instant-Mag said that the song deals with the \"very romantic theme of the loss of [the lover]. This loss leaves an unfathomable lack in the one who remains, which invests the world of dreams to regain the lost happiness. Only memories then allow to savour the well-being of the past relationship\". In his analysis of the song, the psychologist Hugues Royer stated: \"Death is a subterfuge to make the impossible love. (...) Is not it easier to romanticize a dead person than a living one who, sooner or later, will show the faces of his faults? It is indeed the fear of everyday life that terrifies the advocates of absolute love.\" About the lyrics, Farmer explained that she \"do[es] not unit the regret with the notions of disappointment and failure, rather these things that we could do, but that we decide not to do\"."

        "content": "The video is a Requiem Publishing and Heathcliff SA production whose length is 6:17. Directed by Laurent Boutonnat who also co-authored the screenplay with Farmer, the video was filmed for two days in February 1991 in a Jewish cemetery abandoned in Budapest, with a budget of about 35,000 euros. The train, which leads to the cemetery was turned on only for the video which features, in addition to the two singers, a deer. It was broadcast on television for the first time on 9 September 1991 in Stars 90 on TF1. In an interview, Murat explained that he had been very surprised by the extreme severity and great professionalism shown by Boutonnat during the video's shooting. At the beginning of the video, a tram stops in front of the entrance of a snow-covered cemetery. Murat gets off from the tram and pushes the front gate. He walks in the cemetery, passes a deer and meditates at a grave. When he sits, Farmer comes behind him and puts her hands on his eyes. Murat takes Farmer by the hand, then they run, laugh and huddled one against the other in the cemetery. They doze off on a tombstone, and after a last embrace, they say goodbye to each other and split off. The man then gets on the tram and goes away. According to the analysis made by magazine Instant-Mag, the video is the \"metaphor of a past and regretted love\". It \"shows the indispensable link between two people, as well as the inevitability of this link : we can be attached to the other person, but also lose her\". With this video, Farmer \"reached the quintessance of elegant sadness which lives in her work\". According to this analysis, the character played by Murat would be alive and would try to meet that played by Farmer who would be dead. To this end, the train would represent the transition from these two worlds. The deer who flees would be \"the symbol of the woman's essence\", and the bunch of thistles would evoke \"the desire to provoke unconditional love with the other person\". As for the immaculate snow, it would participate in the gloomy atmosphere of the video and would symbolize \"a mild but deadly mask which isolates\" the two opposing parties. Biographer Bernard Violet said that Boutonnat simply transposed the song in the video by adding his personal aesthetic, in this case, a stylized, little contrasted and overexposed black and white. Anything that expresses reality was filmed at normal speed, while all which describes dream, hope or regret, was filmed at slower speed."

It showed Farmer, dressed in white, and lying down a staircase, while Murat, dressed in black, was on the top of the stairs. The performance was actually recorded a few days earlier and the recording lasted approximately six hours as Murat, who was not used to sing on television shows at the time, had some difficulties with his lip sync. As compensation, Farmer sent crates of champagne to technicians the next day. Regarding tours, \"Regrets\" was sung only during the 1999 Mylenium Tour; on this occasion, Farmer performed the song alone, while a red fire was lighted in the hand of the blue statue of the stage. In December 2003, SitolC participated in the national competition \"T\u00e9l\u00e9 Poche\", then in two castings : \"G\u00e9n\u00e9ration M\u00e9tis\" and \"Graine de star\".

This song, with its elegance, deserves to be number 1 on the Top\". Jeune et Jolie deemed the song a \"magical and moving duet\". OK ironically stated the song is \"desperately distressed of beauty\". According to Elia Habib, an expert of French charts, \"Regrets\" is \"a slow [song], which successfully blends the singer's voice [that of Farmer], which merges into the melody to that of Murat, which stands out and thus puts her partner off the scent\". In contrast, French television host Marc Toesca, who presented the singles chart, said in the Best magazine that he did not particularly appreciate the song. Although \"Regrets\" was released in the summer, its sales were rather satisfactory. In France, the single started at number 20 on 24 August 1991, reached the top ten the next week and stayed there for ten consecutive weeks, including a peak at number three on 21 September. It totaled 16 weeks in the top 50. \"Regrets\" was even certified Silver disc by the Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique on 19 December 1991 for over 250,000 units. In Belgium, the song debuted at number 22, entered the top ten and reached number two for two consecutive weeks. It totaled nine weeks in the top five and 18 weeks in the top 30. In France, the single was re-edited in February 2018 and re-entered the chart at number four."

The song was inspired by two characters in the 1782 French epistolary novel Les Liaisons dangereuses, written by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos: the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. In the song, the voice heard on the chorus of the song which repeats \"It's beyond my control\" is in fact a sample of John Malkovich's voice from the film \"Dangerous Liaisons\" by Stephen Frears. For the first time throughout Farmer's career, a CD single was released among the various formats. At the time of the song's release, the radio NRJ prepared a 7\" maxi with a collector picture disc in a limited edition (50 units) and containing a new remix. The song deals with self-control, love, death and the betrayal of the beloved man. Farmer tells her own story from the Valmont's sentence (\"it's beyond my control\"): that of a woman who kills her unfaithful lover after a night of love."

        "content": "The video was directed by Laurent Boutonnat who also wrote the screenplay based on the book \"Les Liaisons dangereuses\", by Choderlos de Laclos. It was his last video for Farmer before that of \"Les Mots\", nine years after. The video was shot for two days at Studio Sets in Stains (where the video of \"Plus grandir\" was already shot in 1985) and cost about only 45,000 euros (the budget was limited because the film Giorgino was in preparation). This Requiem Publishing and Heathcliff SA production features Farmer, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lagache, who was the puppeteer in the video of \"Sans contrefa\u00e7on\" and who there plays her flighty lover, and Christophe Danchaud, a dancer of Farmer's tours, who replaces this one for the bare scenes. Photographer Marianne Rosensthiel who witnessed the shooting of the video, said that the white dress worn by Farmer was custom made by a seamstress. In the video, Farmer, tied on an ignited pyre, tries to struggle. Then she kisses for a long time her lover in torrid scenes, and then, wearing a long and wide dress, she walks on embers, with hands full of blood, while singing. These three scenes continue to intersecting until the end of the video. Then Farmer enters a home and surprises her lover making love with a fair-haired woman. The scenes are very erotic. Farmer bites her lover in the shoulder and some blood trickles along his back; they kiss and some blood flows from their mouths. Two wolves voraciously tear apart the body of a dead man. The video, with many explicit scenes of sex and violence, was censored from its release, making a great to-do in the mass media which published many controversial images. Polydor proposed to French television host Michel Drucker to broadcast in first the video on his show Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es on France 2, but he categorically refused, M6 decided to bill it in full version only after midnight although the Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel did not prohibit it, Canal + agreed to broadcast it in the show Top 50, where the programmer confessed she did not find the video so shocking; and for the channel MCM, it asked advice of its television viewers who had voted for or against. Many journalists from various newspapers expressed concerns about the video and French magazine Star Music even qualified it as a \"crap\". This video was often seen by the general public as a pretext for showing salacious images. However, biographer Bernard Violet believes that the video marked the end of an era in Farmer's career, the era of very sophisticated scenarios, to put more highlight the song. Thus, the video has a narrative framework reduced to its bigger simplicity with short and stripped plans. According to journalist Caroline Beet, the bloody kissing between Farmer and her lover clearly refers to a cannibalistic belief that led primitive people to eat their enemies to feed on their strength. About this video, Farmer explained that she liked the blood and nudity and that her relationships with men were at the time very difficult."

Farmer, who had until then not participated in charitable causes, accepted. She and her writing partner Laurent Boutonnat composed \"Que mon c\u0153ur l\u00e2che\". However the song was rejected as the lyrics were considered to be too ambiguous, seeming to advocate sexual intercourse without condoms. As a result, instead of using \"Que mon c\u0153ur l\u00e2che\" for the charity album, Farmer re-recorded her 1988 song \"Dernier sourire\" (which dealt with the death of a sick person) in an acoustic style. This track was used for the compilation album Urgence \u2013 27 artistes pour la recherche contre le SIDA. At the same time, Farmer and Boutonnat decided to release their first compilation album composed of Remixes, Dance Remixes, in December 1992. To promote the album, the song \"Que mon c\u0153ur l\u00e2che\" was released as a single, which started airing on radio on 5 November 1992, although it aired for the first time four days before on M40, and released on 16 November.

This was the second time that Farmer had recorded one of her singles in a foreign language (the first one being \"My Mum Is Wrong\" in 1984, the English version of \"Maman a tort\"). Mainly edited for Germany and the US, the song was translated by Ira Israel in collaboration with Myl\u00e8ne Farmer. In an interview, Ira Israel said that it was especially difficult to write the lyrics of \"My Soul Is Slashed\" as Farmer was insistent that the song had to convey the right wording, rhythm, meaning, and feeling of the original, rather than being a direct and literal translation. Farmer disliked the first text he had composed and, as a result, they worked together on the English lyrics. The cover of \"My Soul is Slashed\" is similar to that of the French version, but with a black background. The English version of the song has never been performed on television or at Farmer's concerts, and is only available on the European version of the compilation Dance Remixes and on the long-box version of Farmer's 2001 greatest hits package Les Mots.

In an interview, the singer said: \"I tried not to make any commitment. Should we save or not save a condom? It seems to me obviously need to save, but it is not the message I wanted to convey in the song. There is no message elsewhere in the song, simply an observation on love today. Love perverted by the threat of the disease, by the issue of condoms, which arose at the outset that we feel an impetus to another person. Clearly, I say that everyone should take responsibility toward the disease. Everybody is indeed faced with this reality, and I find it sad. Using a condom is not something loose.

Before the song begins in the video, dialogue between Farmer and the two people who respectively portray God and Jesus, are in English language.

Thinking that humans have damaged love, he decides to send his best angel to Earth to hold an investigation. Farmer, the chosen angel, appears. She's dressed in white as a ballerina. Initially she does not hear what God tells her because she is listening to music on a walkman (the song being played is actually the 'extended dance remix' version of \"Que mon c\u0153ur l\u00e2che\"). Once she's on Earth, the song begins. Blowing a black feather from her wrist she discovers three pairs of lovers : one couple who are quarrelling, the second one very modest and the third one very libertine. She goes near the entrance of a nightclub called 'Q', guarded by a large man. Two men, an older one and a younger one, are not allowed to go into this discoth\u00e8que and get slapped in the face; the angel offers them to breathe in an oxygen ball. In between, a muscular young man in panties appears and begins to dance. Michael Jackson appears, briefly performing some of his signature dance moves, only to be crushed when a huge cross falls from the sky, accidentally dropped by Jesus. The angel is quite intrigued by the nightclub, so she dresses up in black clothes, blows a white feather from her wrist and enters into the discoth\u00e8que. There, she sees people with ambiguous sexuality who are walking in a corridor made of white curtains. A topless woman makes her breathe from an oxygen mask, the angel's heart beats faster and faster and eventually explodes. After that, the angel, now very sexily dressed, comes back to Paradise and pops a bubble of gum in front of God."

        "content": "Instant-Mag said the video was inspired by Federico Fellini and Mel Brooks' works, and especially by David Lynch's movie Blue Velvet. Indeed, as in this film, the video alternates between imaginary elements and real situations, while the use of an oxygen mask is a direct callback. It symbolizes the fact that \"every person is looking for his drunkenness which can lead to extreme erotic games\". It is an allegory of what fuels desire. The club named 'Q' in the video may be a reference both to the novel Steppenwolf, written by Hermann Hesse, but also to the bar \"One-Eyed Jack\" in Twin Peaks, in which the heroine Laura Palmer has lost her innocence being fascinated by this bar where fantasies can be satisfied. The message of this video is that, \"behind the appearance of propriety is bursting the world of fantasies and its attractiveness\". This video is also very critical of religions : God is presented as a very austere businessman. Moreover, according to some analyses, the video explains that to give free rein to sexual fantasies, it necessary to transgress social and religious norms (respectively represented by the bouncer and God). As for the white curtains within the nightclub, they would be a symbol of the hymen or condoms. This video is very different from previous ones of Farmer, as it is much more humorous and ironic, especially when Jesus asks God: \"Father, why don't you send me on Earth?\" and the latter replied: \"The last time, it was a disaster\". Farmer said that these dialogues were as a \"smile\", a \"fickleness\" she had not displayed in her former videos."

        "content": "In Finland, a person must have a surname and at least one given name with up to three middle names permitted. Surnames are inherited either patrilineally or matrilineally, while given names are usually chosen by a person's parents. Finnish names come from a variety of dissimilar traditions that were consolidated only in the early 20th century. The first national act on names came into force in 1921, and it made surnames mandatory. Between 1930 and 1985, the Western Finnish tradition whereby a married woman took her husband's surname was mandatory. Previously in Eastern Finland, this was not necessarily the case. On 1 January 2019, the reformed Act on Forenames and Surnames came into force. Finnish given names are often of Christian origin (e.g., Jukka from Greek Johannes), but Finnish and Swedish origins are also common. In Finnish, the letter \"j\" denotes the approximant , as in English you. For example, the two different names Maria and Marja are pronounced nearly identically. The letter \"y\" denotes the vowel , not found in English, but similar to German \"\u00fc\" and French \"u\". \"R\" is rolled. The stress is always on the first syllable in Finnish. For example, Yrj\u00f6 K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen is pronounced . Double letters always stand for a geminate or longer sound (e.g., Marjaana has a stressed short  followed by an unstressed long  and then another unstressed short ). Pronunciation of Swedish names is similar, but long vowels are not doubled and the stress may be on any syllable. Finland has a long bilingual history and it is not unusual for Finnish speakers to have Swedish surnames or given names. Such names may be pronounced according to Finland\u2013Swedish phonology or, depending on the person named, the person speaking and the language used, a Fennicized variant. When writing Finnish names without the Finnish alphabet available (such as in e-mail addresses), the letters \"\u00e4\" and \"\u00f6\" are usually replaced with \"a\" and \"o\", respectively (e.g., P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen as Paakkonen). This is not the same, but visually recognizable."

        "title": "Finnish name_Surnames",
        "content": "Finland has three predominant surname traditions: the West Finnish, the East Finnish and that of the Swedish nobility, clergy, bourgeoisie and military. Until the early 20th century, Finland was a predominantly agrarian society and the names of West Finns were based on their association with a particular area, farm, or homestead (e.g. Jaakko Jussila 'Jaakko from the farm of Jussi'). Farm names typically had the suffix -la, -l\u00e4, and could refer to the husband (like Jussila) or describe the location (e.g. Isoaho 'large clearing'). This name could change every time the person moved to a different farm. Multiple names could be recorded in documents, such that for example Pentti Jussila l. Penttil\u00e4 would be a person named Pentti who had moved from Jussila farm to Penttil\u00e4 farm. Also, even if one had a surname, one would still be better known by the farm name. Farm names, patronyms and village names could be used to disambiguate between different people, but they were not true inherited surnames. For example, in Aleksis Kivi's novel Seven Brothers (1870) the character Juhani was officially summoned as Juhani Juhanin-poika Jukola, Toukolan kyl\u00e4st\u00e4, in English 'Juhani, son of Juhani, from Jukola farm, Toukola village'. On the other hand, the East Finnish surname tradition dates back to the 13th century. There, the Savonians pursued slash-and-burn agriculture which necessitated moving several times during a person's lifetime. This in turn required the families to have surnames, which were in wide use among the common folk as early as the 13th century. By the mid-16th century, the East Finnish surnames had become hereditary. Typically, the oldest East Finnish surnames were formed from the first names of the patriarchs of the families (e.g. Ik\u00e4valko, Termonen, Pentik\u00e4inen). In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, new names were most often formed by adding the place name of the former or current place of living (e.g., Puumalainen < Puumala). In the East Finnish tradition, women carried the family name of their fathers in feminine form indicated by the -tar suffix (e.g. Puumalatar < Puumalainen). By the 19th century, this practice fell into disuse due to the influence of Western European surname tradition. Also, women did not change their surnames with marriage. In 1921, surnames became compulsory for all Finns. At this point, if there was no surname, the homestead names were usually adopted as surnames. Because the inhabitants often included farmhands and other non-family, holders of the same surname are not necessarily genetically related. A typical feature of such names is the addition of prefixes Ala- or Ali- ('Lower') and Yl\u00e4- or Yli- ('Upper'), giving the location of the holding along a waterway in relation of the main holding (e.g. Yli-Ojanper\u00e4, Ala-Verronen). In Pohjanmaa, there are similar prefixes Rinta- and Latva- ('downstream' and 'upstream' respectively). Common suffixes are -nen (in oblique form -se-; e.g., Miettinen : Miettisen \"Miettinen's\"), a diminutive suffix usually meaning \"small\", and -la/-l\u00e4, a locative suffix usually meaning \"place of\". The -nen suffix was freely interchanged with -son or -poika as late as the 16th century, but its meaning was ambiguous as it could refer not only to a \"son\", but any member of a patriarch's family, a farm or even a place. For example, the surname Tuomonen could mean \"Son of Tuomo\" or \"Farm of Tuomo\" or something else belonging to Tuomo. A third tradition of surnames was introduced in Finland by the Swedish-speaking upper and middle classes which used typical German and Swedish surnames. By custom, all Finnish-speaking persons who were able to get a position of some status in urban or learned society, discarded their Finnish name, adopting a Swedish, German or (in case of clergy) Latin surname. In the case of enlisted soldiers, the new name was given regardless of the wishes of the individual. The oldest noble surnames of Swedish origin were not original, but were derived from the charges in the coat of arms, sigil and flag of the family, for example with Sv\u00e4rd (Swedish: \"sword\"), Kurki/Kurck (Finnish: \"crane\") and Kirves (Finnish: \"axe\").  Families of German origin would use the von suffix (e.g., von Wright). In the late 19th and early 20th century, the overall modernization process and especially, the political movement of Fennicization caused a movement for adoption of Finnish surnames. At that time, many persons with a Swedish or otherwise foreign surname changed their family name to a Finnish one. The features of nature with endings -o/\u00f6, -nen (Meri\u00f6 < meri \"sea\", Nieminen < niemi \"peninsula\") are typical of the names of this era, as well as more or less direct translations of Swedish names (Helleranta < H\u00e4llstrand). Fennicizing one's name also concealed non-Finnish origin. For example, Martti Ahtisaari's grandfather was Adolfsen from Norway. Nevertheless, Fennicization was not mandatory and thus it is common to find entirely Finnish-speaking families with Swedish surnames; having a Swedish name does not imply that one would speak Swedish. An effect of industrialization was that large numbers of people moved to the cities and towns and had to adopt a surname. Missing an inherited surname, they invented one from scratch. Initially, these were in Swedish, and they were not very stable; people called them \"superfluous names\" (liikanimi), and a person could change one's surname several times during their career. Later, Finnish became the preferred language, and themes were taken from nature. Some of the most common examples of this type are Laine \"comber, wave\", Vainio \"cultivated field\", Nurmi \"grassland\", and Salo \"grove\". When applicable, -nen or -la/-l\u00e4 could be suffixed, such as in Koskinen \"rapids + nen\". Sharing a surname does not imply that the two persons are related. Regulation of surnames to prevent two families from sharing the same name only began with the 1921 act. Before this, multiple families could have had Fennicized or otherwise changed their surnames to the same name. For example, the Finnish name Rautavaara was adopted by persons with the former Swedish names Sirius, Rosenqvist, Backman, J\u00e4rnberg, Granlund and Mattson. Similarly, the adoption of farm names as surnames by unrelated persons living on the same farm contributed to the number of these shared names."

        "content": "In 21st-century Finland, the use of surnames follows the German model. Every person is legally obliged to have a first and last name. At most four first names are allowed (at most three prior to January 1, 2019). When marrying, a Finnish couple may adopt a common surname, either one that either spouse had as unmarried or a combination of the spouses' names as unmarried. They may also retain their surnames, either can take one of their spouse's surnames and either can combine their surname with that of their spouse. If they take a common surname, that will be the surname of their children, otherwise their children can get either parent's surname or a double surname combining those of their parents. Grandparents' names can be used based on a family's foreign name tradition. When combining double surnames, only one part of each can be used; the double surname can consist of the two individual surnames as such or combined with a hyphen. Between 1986 and 2018, a spouse could keep their surname, take their spouse's as a common surname, or take their spouse's surname as a common surname but use it in combination with their own as a hyphenated double surname, while their spouse use it as such. If they had a common surname the children got that name, otherwise the surname of either parent. (From 1929 to 1985 a wife had to take their spouse's surname or a double name.) Regardless, siblings normally get the same surname. All persons have the right to change their surname once without any specific reason. A surname that is un-Finnish, contrary to the usages of the Swedish or Finnish languages, or in use by any person resident in Finland cannot be accepted as the new name, unless valid family reasons or religious or national customs give a reason for waiving this requirement. However, persons may change their surname to any surname that has ever been used by their ancestors, if they can prove such claim.<ref>The information here is taken from the Finnish FINLEX \u00ae - Ajantasainen lains\u00e4\u00e4d\u00e4nt\u00f6: Kumottu s\u00e4\u00e4d\u00f6s Nimilaki (kumottu) 694/1985 Nimilaki (694/1985)] (Name Act). Retrieved 11-6-2007</ref> Surnames behave like regular words when forming grammatical cases. Thus, for example, the genitive of surname M\u00e4ki is M\u00e4en, just like the regular word m\u00e4ki (\"hill\") becomes m\u00e4en in the genitive. For given names this is not always the case even if the word is a regular word; for example Suvi (\"summer\") becomes Suvin in the genitive,  not Suven. In 1985, of the types of surnames, 38% of Finns had a -nen name, 8.9% -la, 7.4% with other derivative suffix (e.g., -io/-i\u00f6, as in Meri\u00f6, or -sto/-st\u00f6, as in Niinist\u00f6), 17.5% other names in Finnish, 14.8% non-Finnish (chiefly Swedish), 13.1% with compound word names (e.g., Kivim\u00e4ki \"stone hill\", Rautakoski \"iron rapids\"). Only 0.3% had a double-barreled name (e.g., marriage of a Forsius to Harkimo giving Forsius-Harkimo)."

The natural Finnish way of referring to someone's parentage is the genitive: Matin Olli (\"Matthew's Olaf\") instead of the solemn Olli Matinpoika (\"Olaf Matthew's son\"). When patronymics were no longer required in documents, they quickly fell out of use. They are still perfectly legal, but very rare, often representing a deliberate archaism. Unlike in Swedish, Finnish patronymics were not transferred into hereditary family names. Thus, the Finnish situation differs considerably from, for instance, Sweden, which has hundreds of thousands of Johanssons and Anderssons. The Swedish patronymic-like surnames are treated as any other surname. Real patronymics are handled like additional first names, i.e., one must still have a surname.

        "title": "Finnish name_First names",
        "content": "The native Finnish tradition of first names was lost during the early Christian period, and by the 16th century, only Christian first names were accepted. The popular names were usually the names of saints whose cult was widespread. This resulted in some differences between the Western and Eastern Finnish first names, as the names in Eastern Finland might have had forms derived from Russian or Church-Slavic, instead of Swedish and Latin forms. For example, there are two Finnish cognates of George, Yrj\u00f6 < Swedish \u00d6rjan and Jyri < Russian \u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 (Yuri). The most important source for researching the name forms actually used by the Finns themselves in the 15th to 18th centuries are the surnames preserved in written sources, as these often are formed on the basis of a first name. The first names themselves are usually given in Swedish or Latin forms, as these are the languages used in the sources. The name actually used was a Fennicized form of the name, which might change as the person became older. For example, a person given the Swedish name Gustaf in the parish register might be called Kustu as a child, Kusti as an adolescent, Ky\u00f6sti or K\u00f6pi as an adult and Kustaa as an old man. In the early 19th century, almost all Finnish first names were taken from the official almanac, published by the Royal Academy of Turku, later the University of Helsinki. The names were mostly names of the saints whose cult had been popular before the Reformation, but the almanac also incorporated a number of names from the Old Testament and Swedish royalty, which were added to certain days during the 17th and 18th centuries. During the 19th century, the Finnish forms were gradually added to the Finnish almanac, while the Swedish and Latin forms were removed (the Swedish forms were retained in a separate Swedish almanac). At the same time, the vicars gradually started to use Finnish name forms in parish registers. This in turn, cemented the Finnish name forms used. Names with originally Finnish etymology were revived in the 19th century. In the absence of reliable information about ancient names, parents chose names of mythical characters from folklore (Aino, Tapio), and many new names were created from Finnish words (Seppo \"smith\" or \"skilled person\", Ritva \"birch twig\"). Some clergymen initially refused to christen babies with such \"pagan\" names. The first given name of Finnish origin, Aino, was accepted in the almanac in 1890, followed by numerous others in 1908. About 30% of Finns born in 1910\u20131939 received a name with Finnish etymology. By the 1930s, the use of Finnish names and name forms was stabilized and most of the popular names were noted in the almanac. Since then, the almanac has been gradually changed to include new, popular names. At present, all names which have at least 1,000 bearers are incorporated into the almanac of the University of Helsinki and given a \"name day\" (). At present, 792 of the 35,000 first names used in Finland are listed in the Finnish almanac. The nimip\u00e4iv\u00e4 calendar follows the Medieval Catholic Saint calendar when applicable. First names are subject to changing fashions, while second or third given names are more traditional and typically trisyllabic. In the table below both first and middle names are counted. Since the digitalization of the Finnish national population database in the 1970s, the most popular names in Finland (of all Finnish residents or citizens who have lived after that point) have beenThe origins of the names are taken from Vilkuna (1976). Of the names listed, Annikki and Marjatta are etymologically related to Anna and Maria, but they are characters in the Kalevala, not used as given names before the 19th century."

        "content": "As in general in European culture, the surname is seen as more formal and the first names as less formal. Strangers are expected to refer to each other by their surnames and using grammar in formal plural. The use of first names indicates familiarity, and children often refer to each other by first names only. However, in many workplaces familiarity between individuals working on the same site is assumed. In contrast to other European tradition, the use of titles such as tohtori \"Doctor\" with surnames is not very common and is found only in highly formal contexts, or it is considered old-fashioned.  The titles equivalent to Mr., Mrs. and Miss are herra, rouva and neiti, respectively. Thus, for example, in formal contexts, Matti Johannes Virtanen can be referred to as herra Virtanen or herra Matti Virtanen, if several Virtanens are present. In most other contexts, simply one name, surname or first name, is used. As in Swedish culture, politeness is often expressed by indirect address, such that the use of names might even be deliberately avoided. In spite of this, formal Finnish features various titles, particularly presidential citations such as vuorineuvos or ministeri."

It was first published in 1837 in the literary magazine Sovremennik on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the battle. In Russia, it is required reading in most schools. The poem was based on his 1831 teenage version, The Battlefield of Borodino (\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430). The poem starts with the direct appeal \"Tell me, uncle,...\". Lermontov had several relatives (Arsenyevs and Stolypins) who were veterans of the Patriotic War of 1812, and there have been speculation that the poem was based on the narrations of one of them. Other critics suggest that his original version was written under the influence of Denis Davydov's Borodino Battlefield (\u0411\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435)."

The Kazakh Wikipedia had a very high growth rate in 2011, going from 7,000 articles to over 100,000 in less than one year, largely due to the incorporation of materials from the Kazakh Encyclopedia, which have been released under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License (CC BY-SA). This rapid expansion was initiated by the non-profit Wikibilim Foundation. The Samruk Kazyna Foundation, Kazakhstan's sovereign oil wealth fund, sponsored the expansion, with 30 million tenge spent in 2011 for paid editing, digitalization, and author rights transfer. At the Wikimania 2011 conference WikiBilim president Rauan Kenzhekhanuly was awarded the Wikipedian of the Year award by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales for his work on the Kazakh Wikipedia expansion. In April 2012 Tengri News reported that \"in 2011, the Samruk Kazyna sovereign wealth fund allocated a total of $204 thousand to develop the Kazakh-language Wikipedia. This year, another $136 thousand will be earmarked\", citing the Fund's Press Service. Wales thanked the Kazakh government for its support of the Kazakh Wikipedia at Wikimania 2012. The Kazakh Wikipedia can be viewed and written in three different scripts: Cyrillic, Latin, and Arabic. On 26 October 2011, it passed the 100,000 articles threshold, and by early 2013 had just over 200,000 articles."

Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales' friendship with ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who advises the Kazakh government, has also come under scrutiny, as has the neutrality of the Kazakh Wikipedia's content, much of which is a reproduction of the state-published national encyclopedia. In 2015, Jimmy Wales stated on Reddit that at the time he gave Kenzhekhanuly the inaugural Wikipedian of the Year award, he'd been unaware of Kenzhekhanuly's prior positions as first secretary at Kazakhstan's embassy in Moscow and as an adviser to the governor of Kazakhstan's Mangystau region; by 2015, Kenzhekhanuly had gone on to become deputy governor of Kazakhstan's Kyzylorda region and founding director of Eurasian Council on Foreign Affairs, a think-tank funded by the Kazakh government."

It launched in April 2008 and switched to online-only distribution in January 2009 after having published a total of ten issues. The magazine continued online until 2020, when that year's edition of its Faces series prominently mentioned the website having seized publication. It enjoyed a good run and was voted Best Music Site in 2008 and Best Web Publication in 2010 in the Irish Web Awards. Originally, the concept of the magazine involved a hard copy of which there was a charge to purchase. However after six issues it was decided to make the magazine's content free both online and in print. The first issue, April 2008, appeared on Irish shelves on 6 March 2008 and featured Michael Stipe of R.E.M. on the cover. This immediately garnered comparisons between the new magazine's similarities with Hot Press who featured Stipe on their cover at the same time, a move widely thought to be an attempt by Hot Press to stifle State's status as a serious 'alternative' to the more established local magazine. At a price of \u20ac5.50, State charged \u20ac2 more than Hot Press. State was published by Roger Woolman and edited by Hot Press alumni Phil Udell. Contributors included Evening Herald columnist, The Irish Times reviewer and blogger Sin\u00e9ad Gleeson, Rolling Stone writer Kara Manning, award-winning blogger Niall Byrne (a.k.a. Nialler9), Event Guide writer David O'Mahony and The Star feature writer Tanya Sweeney. The magazine's art director, Simon Roche, was named designer of the year by the Periodical Publishers Association of Ireland in December 2008. From October 2008 until January 2009 the magazine was made available for free of charge from a number of venues around Ireland's major cities and online from the magazine's website, following a number of other magazines such as Mongrel, Connected and Analogue Magazine in providing their print content free of charge. The first freely distributed issue of State featured Kings of Leon on the cover. After January 2009, the magazine was only available online from its website."

The magazine claimed to showcase black models in response to anger caused by the disinclination of fashion magazines to display black models on their covers. Fashion industry insiders claim black models are featured less often because they are unable to sell. This statement, along with the formation of a protest group in New York City that challenges racism in the industry, convinced Italian Vogue'''s editor, Franca Sozzani to create this issue. Instead of the issue not selling, it became the highest selling issue of Italian Vogue ever, and had run out of print twice, which marked the first time in Cond\u00e9 Nast history that the magazine reprinted an issue to satisfy demand. The reprinted copies had the tag lines \"Most Wanted Issue Ever\" and \"First Reprint\" banded across the front. However, even though the advertising pages went up 30 percent, there was a \"glaring lack of black models\" in them. Meisel said: \"I've asked my advertising clients so many times, 'Can we use a black girl?' They say no. Advertisers say black models don't sell.\" VogueEncycloVogueEncyclo'' is a fashion encyclopedia founded by Vogue Italia (Cond\u00e9 Nast Digital). It went live on 10 October 2011.

On 7 June 2008, a 30-second music clip was leaked to the Internet as well as the official cover art. On 14 June, the whole song was available to the Internet. At the time, as the origins of this song were, however, unclear, it had thus led many to believe that this leaked song was actually a remix due to its lack of lyrics. Surprisingly, on the night from 13 to 14 June, the e-compil site, the official platform for downloading of Universal Music, proposed, for a few hours only, to legally download the song, probably by mistake. On 16 June, \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" was aired for the first time on Radio Jeune Reims, at 8:20\u00a0pm, although it was announced that NRJ should have the exclusivity of the first broadcast, on 19 June, at 7:00\u00a0am. According to the French newspaper Le Parisien, the DJ Martin Solveig participated in one of the song remixes. As scheduled, on 19 June, several radio stations broadcast \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\", including NRJ, Delta FM and RTL. The song was then also available digitally on musicMe, virginmega.fr and iTunes, but only one version. A few days later, an unofficial CDR promo (unknown remix) of \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" was circulated and received attention from high-profile DJs. Finally, it was announced that the song would be released as a physical single on 18 August. On 4 July, certain French radio stations began to broadcast the radio edit version of the remix produced by Martin Solveig. On the occasion of the single release, Farmer formed for the first time a partnership with a mobile phone company. So, the SFR subscribers received two SMS announcing first when the song would be available digitally on its site, then when the three excerpts of the music video would be broadcast on its site. On 11 July, the newspaper Info Music Hebdo said that the CD single would be released in a limited edition (50,000 copies) and that the CD maxi would contain remixes by Tomer G and Manhattan Clique who had previously worked with Farmer for \"Slipping Away (Crier la vie)\". In early September, TF1 promoted the song airing some excerpts between the programmes and the fully music video in the night."

        "content": "The song has an electro and techno-sexy feel and the lyrics play with sonorities, including alliterations. The only natural instruments audible in the song are piano and percussion; all others are effects. According to Discordance.fr, \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" is \"an unstructured song, not a summer hit with an easy approach\", and its music is \"hypnotic\". It can be assimilated to \"Psychiatric\", \"La Ronde triste\" or \"Alice\" because of \"its short text and its rather dub\". The song \"amounts to a couplet repeated in buckle, a spoken bridge, and many choirs\". The text \"remains partially incomprehensible without reading official lyrics\". The electronic sound has a \"more metallic rhythmic\" than Farmer's previous singles and constitutes \"a remarkable artistic experiment\". Psychologist Hugues Royer said that the message of the song is to \"shake the boredom to find again the desire\", to \"promote sex therapy\" to \"reset the appetite for life\". Interviewed by Claire Chazal in the news broadcasting of 31 August, 8:00\u00a0pm, on TF1, Farmer explained that the title of the song was a reference to \"D\u00e9senchant\u00e9e\", her 1991 number-one hit, in which the word \"g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" is mentioned. On the cover of the various formats, Farmer is shown naked from the back. She has a green jade prayer beads around the neck that goes from the back to the buttocks and ends with a G-string-shaped cross and has in her back an enormous scar whose threads form the letters IY'H which mean in Hebrew : \"With God's will\". Farmer's position on the cover resembles the subject of Man Ray's 1924 painting Le Violon d'Ingres, as well as that on the cover of her single \"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\"."

Polydor and French magazine Paris-Match announced that Bruno Aveillan, a director who has directed several television commercials for companies such as Perrier, Louis Vuitton, Orange, Nintendo, Nike and Philips, directed this 4:30 music video. About thirty actors as well as the dancers of Cave Canem troupe feature in it. According to Aveillan, extras perform \"a resolutely modern choreography, full of unexpected.\" In addition, a Phantom camera, ordinarily devoted to the scientific research, was used for the shooting. Patricia Aveillan, Bruno Aveillan's mother, made the dress worn by Farmer in the video and explained in an interview that she was informed just ten days before the shooting. Her daughter and her son-in-law also participated in the shooting. The photographer Claude Gassian attended the shooting of the video. The video shows Farmer lying on an operating table in a laboratory, surrounded by scientists. When the music begins, she wakes up, unties her strips, gets up, and throws blue laser beams from her palms to the doctors and the militaries. Suddenly, they begin to perform choreographied sexual intercourses (men with men, women with women, women with men) which eventually end as an orgy, while Farmer goes out of the laboratory.Chuberre, 2009, p. 221. On 26 June, SFR site revealed an excerpt from the music video for \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\". Two other excerpts were broadcast on 1 and 2 July. The video was eventually fully aired on television on 10 July and immediately available on several official websites such as TF1.fr, Music SFR and universalmusic.fr. In Russia, \"MTV Russia\" channel aired regularly the music video. This video was generally well received in the media. For example, Musique.evous said: \"Its atmosphere is consistent with the single and the universe of its performer: cold, careful and erotic. (...) The production is impeccable and the greatest attention was paid to lighting, the texture of the bodies and the special effects\". Many critics have noticed that the video was \"erotic\" and \"provocative\", and some have thought it was inspired by Luc Besson's film The Fifth Element (futuristic atmosphere, red hair, body covered with strips) or Le Parfum. According to La Meuse, gay scenes \u2013 including two soldiers who kiss and undress each other \u2013 would be \"a wink to the fascination that Farmer has always exerted on the gay public\". Royer said this video is \"peppered with special effects worthy of the early career [of Farmer]\" and conveys a message \"which invites its listeners to come out of coma where they languish sex to engage in sexual intercourses without taboo. (...) The singer achieves the challenge of updating of the message of \"Libertine\" without giving the feeling of repetition.\" In January 2009, when the third single from the album was released, it was revealad that the music video for \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" as well as that of \"Si j'avais au moins...\", were part of a short film named The Farmer Project. The action takes place in a country in Eastern Europe in the 1950s or 1960s. It begins with Farmer, who portrays a creature with supernatural powers, who is captured by two policemen and studied in a laboratory. At this point, the music video for \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" starts."

On 29 July, Yahoo! proposed on its homepage a very critical analysis of \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\", both at the level of music and video. Tribu Move deemed that this song marked a big musical change in the singer's career. On 18 August, French magazine T\u00e9l\u00e9 Star qualified \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" as a \"failure\", \"a repetitive single without refrain, which has left perplexed fans of the first hour as well as professional people\". It also stressed that the song was \"poorly aired on radio due to overall negative feedbacks from listeners\". According to Le Monde, \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" is characterized by \"rather minimalist arrangements and a curtness tone\". For Le Figaro, it is a \"very commercial single\", with a \"powerful rhythmic\", a \"very forward voice\", and \"imperturbably 'farmerian' lyrics\". Starac Mag deemed the song is \"less melodious than [Farmer's] previous titles, but equally effective\". As for Le Point, \"D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration\" is \"a repetitive electro pop [song] with naive lyrics full of muddled and mystic double meanings\". More positive, Swiss newspaper Coop\u00e9ration stated: \"Make love, not the war: such is the message of this electro-pop hit which eyes up Depeche Mode\"."

It fell off the top 50 after 13 weeks. In France, the single went straight to number one on the SNEP chart on 23 August, selling 27,401 units, which was the highest weekly sales of 2008 for a number-one single in France, and it marked return to number-one single since last single \"XXL\", released in 1995.

Unhappy in his marriage and the monotony and meaninglessness of his life, he is frequently unfaithful and considers women to be of \"a lower race\".  While vacationing in Yalta, he sees a young woman walking along the seafront with her little Pomeranian, and endeavors to make her acquaintance. The lady, Anna Sergeyevna, is also unhappily married and vacationing without her husband. Anna and Dmitri soon commence an affair, and spend most of their time together, often walking and taking drives to the nearby village of Oreanda. Though she is expecting her husband to come to Yalta, he eventually sends word for her to come home, saying that something is wrong with his eyes.  Gurov sees her off at the station. As they part, both feel that they will never see each other again, and thus their affair is over. Returning to Moscow, to his loveless marriage and his daily routine, working by day and socializing by night, Gurov expects to soon forget young Anna, but to his surprise, her memory haunts him. Unexpectedly, he fell deeply in love for the first time, after many affairs and just as he is approaching middle age. He feels that he must see Anna, despite the obvious complications. On the ruse of going to St. Petersburg to attend to personal business, he sets off to Anna's hometown to find her.  Learning the location of the family's residence from a hotel porter, he finds the house, only to realize that it would be unwise to intrude. In despair, he rationalizes that Anna has probably forgotten him and found someone else, and heads back to his hotel. In the evening, he remembers having seen a sign earlier in the day announcing the opening performance of The Geisha. Reasoning that Anna and her husband might attend, he goes to the theater. The couple enters and he watches intently. When the husband goes out for a smoke during the first interval, Gurov greets Anna, who is bewildered and runs from him. After following her through the theater, he confronts her and she confides that she has been thinking of him constantly.  Frightened, she begs him to leave and promises to see him in Moscow. Anna makes excuses to travel to Moscow, telling her husband that she is going there to see a doctor, which he \"believes and does not believe\". The pair are now fully aware that for the first time in their lives they have actually fallen in love, and they both wonder how they might overcome the many challenges that face them and achieve their fervent wish to spend their lives together. They desperately try to come up with a plan, but the story ends without offering a resolution:\"They \u2026 talked of how to avoid the necessity for secrecy, for deception, for living in different towns and not seeing each other for long stretches of time \u2026 and it was clear to both of them that \u2026 the most complicated and difficult part of their journey was just beginning.\""

When touched by love, we know the world in a different way. Love changes the inner landscape, too. Under the pressure of love, Gurov looks inside himself and sees someone he has not known before, someone capable of feelings that he barely knew existed.\" Nabokov wrote about the unconventional ending:\"All the traditional rules ... have been broken in this wonderful short story ... no problem, no regular climax, no point at the end. And it is one of the greatest stories ever written.\""

An adaptation of The Lady with the Dog, Dark Eyes (Italian: Oci ciornie; Russian: \u041e\u0447\u0438 \u0447\u0451\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435; French: Les Yeux noirs) is a 1987 Italian and Russian language film which tells the story of a 19th-century married Italian man who falls in love with a married Russian woman. It stars Marcello Mastroianni, Silvana Mangano, Oleg Tabakov, Yelena Safonova, Pina Cei and Vsevolod Larionov. The film was adapted by Aleksandr Adabashyan, Suso Cecchi d'Amico and Nikita Mikhalkov, \"inspired by\" stories by Anton Chekhov. It was directed by Mikhalkov. Mastroianni received Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The story has also been adapted for stage; for example, an adaptation by Peter Campbell was featured at the 2002 Chekhov Now Festival in New York. A play titled Sunstroke, directed by Oleg Mirochnikov, combines The Lady with the Dog with Ivan Bunin's Sunstroke. The play was performed in 2013 at the Platform Theatre in London. An opera version titled \"The Lady with the Pet Dog\" was premiered at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa in 2010. Joyce Carol Oates wrote a short story adaptation of the story also entitled \"The Lady with the Pet Dog\" published in 1972. Oates' story is told from Anna's point of view and is set in New York and Nantucket. Brian Friel's play The Yalta Game (2001) is loosely based on this short story by Chekhov. Tony Tanner debuted a musical-comedy version of the story in September, 2016, which he wrote and directed. Titled \"The Lady with the Little Dog,\" it was performed at the Great Hall Courtyard of Plummer Park in West Hollywood, California."

There are many English villages called Norton or including Norton as part of the name, e.g. Midsomer Norton, Chipping Norton, Brize Norton etc. When surnames started to be used in the Middle Ages, a man from such a village might have the name added e.g. Tom of Norton. Alternatively a man from the north side of any village might be given the name Tom Norton to distinguish him from a Tom from the south side (Tom Sutton). A secondary source for the surname is from the anglicisation of Celtic (Irish and Scottish Gaelic) surnames (e.g. Naughtan). It is also sometimes found as a Jewish surname (probably from the anglicisation of the German surname Norden). The famous Emperor Norton in San Francisco was of Jewish origin from a South African settler family."

The magazine published an important group of international intellectuals and writers, from Mexico, Latin America, the United States, and Europe, many of whom Paz met during his remarkable career. These included Carlos Fuentes, Mario Vargas Llosa, Gabriel Zaid, E.M.

Paz published a collection of poems under the title Vuelta, which were written between 1969 and 1974. In 1988, historian Enrique Krauze criticized Carlos Fuentes and his fiction in an article Vuelta, dubbing him a \"guerrilla dandy\" for the perceived gap between his Marxist politics and his personal lifestyle, as well as his long absences from the country he wrote about. This essay contributed to a permanent rift between Paz and Fuentes, formerly close friends, who were also estranged because of Fuentes' support for the Sandinistas. Vuelta received the 1993 Prince of Asturias Award for Communications and Humanities. In the award, Vuelta was described as \"one of the most important cultural phenomena in the Spanish language\"."

It was examined by Martin Gerbert (1773), Scholz, Rettig, J. Rendel Harris, Oscar von Gebhardt. Rettig thought that Codex Sangallensis is a part of the same manuscript as Codex Boernerianus. The text of the codex was edited by H. C. M. Rettig in 1836, but with some mistakes (e.g. in Luke 21:32 \u03bf\u03c6\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 instead of \u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2). There are references made to the opinions of Gottschalk (\u2020 866) in Luke 13:24; John 12:40, and to Hand Aragon (\u2020  941). The codex is located in the Abbey library of St. Gallen (48) at St. Gallen."

Numbers begin circulating: hundreds of people will come,  thousands say the media. To the poor citizens of Melo this means  pilgrims in need of food and drink, paper flags, souvenirs, and commemorative medals. Brimming with enthusiasm, the locals hope not only for divine blessing but also a small share of material happiness. Petty smuggler Beto is certain that he's found the best business idea of all: \"The Pope\u2019s Toilet\", where the thousands of visiting pilgrims can find relief. Beto is thwarted by lack of funds and the local mobile customs enforcement officer. Ultimately the promised \"60,000 to 200,000\" Brazilians do not materialise. Apparently (in the film's postscript) only 400 Brazilians came, disproportionately served by 387 stalls for food and trinkets. The film makes it clear that the visit was a financial disaster to the town rather than bringing any wealth as promised. Beto has spent his daughter's college fund to no avail, but she forgives him, and at least he has a nice toilet. Regardless of the claims made in the film's postscript committed to uphold a good sense of humor at all costs, international media reported the Pope's open-air mass in the town of Melo with 39,000 inhabitants was attended by a crowd of about 50,000 people."

In addition, users could add specific buildings and services onto the map such as local businesses and services. Three kinds of drawing tools were available: placemark (a single point of interest on the map), line (for drawing roads, railways, rivers, and the like) and polygon (for defining boundaries and borders, adding parks, lakes and other large features). The approach encouraged by users and by Google was to trace features such as roads from the existing satellite imagery. This approach was not useful in areas with poor satellite imagery, and users consequently created less map data in those areas. New users' contributions were moderated by more experienced users or reviewers at Google to ensure quality and prevent vandalism. As users made more successful contributions, their edits were less closely monitored and may have been published on the map straight away. Certain larger features may have taken a long time to appear on the map as they were waiting to be rendered by the server. Contributors could assign areas of the map as their 'neighbourhood', that is an area they know well enough to make detailed contributions to. Users could also moderate the contributions of others within their neighbourhood. This information was private; the neighbourhood a user selected was not publicly associated with the users' account."

The name followed a similar trajectory in the United Kingdom, gaining popularity in the 1950s, peaking in the 1960s, gradually declining in the 1970s to 1980s, and falling out of the top 100 most popularly given names by the 1990s. Oxford's A Dictionary of First Names suggests that anglicized Kevin may have influenced the adoption of Kelvin (in origin a river name) as a modern given name, which peaked in popularity at about the same time, albeit to a much lesser extent (peaking at rank 209 as of 1961 in the US). Conversely, in non-English-speaking Europe, the name picked up popularity in the 1980s. The name had been introduced to Europe via pop culture, and was notorious for being extremely popular among lower-class parents during the end of 1980s to 2000s. The name peaked markedly in the early 1990s, reaching first rank in France during 1989\u20131994, during 1991\u20131992 in Switzerland and in 1991 in Germany. The 1991 peak in German-speaking Europe is due to the Christmas comedy film Home Alone, marketed as \"Kevin \u2013 Allein zu Haus\" in German (named for protagonist \"Kevin McCallister\", played by 10-year-old Macaulay Culkin). Especially in Germany, the name became associated with low social status, an attitude popularised in German journalism based on a 2009 master thesis on primary teachers' reactions to children's given names. \"Kevinism\" has become  a short-hand for short-lived fads in given names based in pop culture."

        "content": "The concept behind The Who Sell Out was to make the album sound like a pirate radio station, including fake commercials between the songs.  \"Odorono\" fitted with the concept by being a phony commercial for a brand of underarm deodorant, but it is also a substantial song in its own right.  The lyrics tell the story of a woman singer who has just completed a successful performance and awaits a handsome man named Mr. Davidson to come backstage to congratulate her.  In the words of Townshend, \"it looks like she's all set, not only for stardom but also for true love\".  But when Mr. Davidson bends over to kiss her, her body odor turns him off, ruining her chances at both stardom and love.  The song ends with the admonishment that \"Her deodorant had let her down / She should have used Odorono\". The song represents the increasing importance of narrative in Townshend's songwriting.  Townshend was proud of the song, stating that he \"dug\" it because \"it was a little story, and although I thought it's a good song, it was about something groovy\u00a0\u2014 underarm perspiration.\"  And of the singer's hopes being disappointed, Townshend went on to say: \"And you know, without getting too serious about it, because it's supposed to be very light, that's life.  It really is. That really is life.\" The Mr. Davidson in the song may have referred to Harold Davidson, who was a famous booking agent in London at the time the song was written.  Although the song is a fake commercial, a real deodorant product named Odorono once existed. The Who recorded \"Odorono\" on 11 October 1967 at IBC Studios.  In addition to singing, Townshend plays rhythm guitar on the song."

Author John Atkins calls the music \"attractive\" and the lyrics \"amusing\" and \"melodramatic\".  John Dougan calls the song \"an inciteful critique of the entertainment industry's elevation of style and appearance over talent, as well as a satire of products as salvation\" and states that \"the song is unexpectedly heartfelt, partly the result of the anguish expressed in Townshend's voice and the story's cinematic quality\".  Dougan also remarks on \"Odorono\"'s \"narrative arc and character development\" and notes that these qualities allow the listener to sympathize with the singer and feel a little annoyed at Mr. Davidson's \"insensitivity and superficiality\"."

On 6 February 2006, two armed men broke into the offices of El Ma\u00f1ana and detonated a grenade. They also shot the outside walls of the installation with AK-47s and AR-15s before fleeing the scene. According to La Jornada, the armed men shot the installation more than 100 times, injuring Jaime Orozco Tey, a journalist. On 30 July 2010, a group of armed men in a vehicle threw a grenade at the offices of Televisa in Nuevo Laredo, damaging two vehicles. On 26 September 2011, Elizabeth Macias-Castro, an editor of la Primera Hora newspaper, was decapitated; a note was left behind by Los Zetas, claiming responsibility for the killing. A group of armed men attacked the offices of El Ma\u00f1ana newspaper in Nuevo Laredo at around 23:00 hours on 11 May 2012. The Mexican authorities stated that no one was injured in the 5-minute shootout, but the offices and some vehicles were damaged when bullets impacted from the outside. When the employees of El Ma\u00f1ana heard the detonations, they threw themselves on the floor, while others suffered nervous breakdowns. Some witnesses said that they heard grenade explosions during the attack. In addition, a message was reportedly left behind by the perpetrators. Due to the violent attacks the press has received in Nuevo Laredo, news media have practiced \"self-censorship,\" where local journalist prefer to silence the press and refuse to report on important incidents for fears of reprisals by the cartels. Events that would go on the front-page of any newspaper\u2014mass murders with over six dead, shooting incidents wounding three soldiers\u2014often go unreported in Nuevo Laredo. The cartels want the cities they control to appear calm in order to prevent the government from sending federal troops. Consequently, the press, tired of extortions and death threats, prefers to silence because there is no guarantee for their safety. On 14 May 2012, El Ma\u00f1ana declared that it will no longer report on news relating to drug-violence. On 14 May 2013, the newspaper suffered a cyber-attack on its official website. According to El Ma\u00f1ana, the attacks are intended to saturate the page and damage information databases of the newspaper, particularly in columns where they question the performance of local officials."

The magazine was used as a tool by Dassault to propagate his political ideas and vision, such as organizing a World Fair in Paris (which did not happen). It was sent for free to all French dentists and physicians in France so that it was available to patients in the waiting rooms. It was essentially supported by publicity, which allow to keep a relatively low price. The magazine is headquartered in Paris. It had pages devoted to fashion, health issues, social events in Paris, a regular editorial by Marcel Dassault, drawings by Jacques Faizant, Coq (Luis Garc\u00eda Gallo), Kiraz and Herv\u00e9 (alias of Herv\u00e9 des Valli\u00e8res).

Like many representatives of the Russian intelligentsia, members of this musical community were imbued with the plight of the peasants and sought to write works that would draw people's attention to this poorest layer of society. The young composer Modest Mussorgsky decides to devote his life to music and to make it the property of the people. Only his mother supports his \u201cignoble\u201d undertakings. The young man leaves military service and ponders writing a work about the peasants, together with members of The Five. The Imperial Musical Society is not pleased with the activities of composers; it excludes Mily Balakirev. The writer Vladimir Stasov expresses his opinion by calling the Society newspaper musical liars, eventually ending up in court for libel, and being sued for a monetary penalty. During a trial, many supporters of \"The Five\" are presented. A peasant music school, created by composers, is described for debts. Meanwhile, not one of the editions of Mussorgsky\u2019s opera Boris Godunov was allowed to appear in the imperial theaters. The directorate surrenders when the whole city begins to protest; the opera is a tremendous success. Boris Godunov radically changes the direction of the work of Russian composers."

        "content": "While Dave Gahan was still busy with his solo album Hourglass (2007), Martin Gore was in his home studio in Santa Barbara, California, working on new songs. In May 2008 the band hit the studio to record their twelfth studio album. Ben Hillier took the production reins again, because the band were so satisfied with their previous collaboration on Playing the Angel (2005). As with their previous album Playing the Angel, Dave Gahan once again wrote three songs with Christian Eigner and Andrew Phillpott: \"Hole to Feed\", \"Come Back\", and \"Miles Away/The Truth Is\". Martin Gore shares lead vocal duties with Gahan on \"In Chains\", \"Peace\", and \"Little Soul\". The band described the time in the studio as very productive, a total of 22 songs were created and it was difficult to choose the right songs for the album. Five of the songs not used on the album were released as part of the deluxe box set. Short video clips of the band and production team at work in the studio were regularly posted on the band's homepage. This would be the first time that the band would openly post detailed clips of their recording process on social media. Lyrically, this album has a good amount of personal lyrics. Gahan explained that the song \"Hole To Heed\" was written about the desire to fill a metaphorical hole but not knowing what to fill it up with. The song \"Wrong\" was described by Gore to have a bit of black humor in its lyrics but doesn't want people to find it depressing. Gore believed that \"Peace\" is one of the best songs he had ever written. Even though the track \"Miles Away/The Truth Is\" is not inherently about drugs, Gahan feels like that subject is always present in his songs due to his past substance abuse. Musically, the album has a heavy use of analog synthesizers giving it a more traditional electronic sound. The opening track \"In Chains\" opens with synthesizers tuning up. \"Wrong\" was chosen to be the first single off the album since the band felt it sounded very different. Gahan described the track as having R&B influences while also being a rant. Gahan explained that \"Come Back\" was going to sound more gospel but the band decided to make it into a wall of sound."

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 70, based on 28 reviews. Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt stated that on Sounds of the Universe, Depeche Mode \"still sound genuinely inspired\" and Ned Raggett of AllMusic concluded, \"Sounds of the Universe is a grower, relying on a few listens to fully take effect, but when it does, it shows Depeche Mode are still able to combine pop-hook accessibility and their own take on 'roots' music for an electronic age with sonic experimentation and recombination.\" Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph noted that the album \"shows up the imaginative constraints of most guitar-based rock.\" However, Rolling Stone critic Melissa Maerz felt that \"the result sounds like a time machine back to the Eighties\", adding that \"Depeche Mode should be poised for a comeback, but it's too soon to unpack those black turtlenecks.\" Bill Stewart of PopMatters wrote that Depeche Mode \"tempt us with a strong first half and then dump us in a collection of tossed off b-sides.\" Jon Caramanica wrote for The New York Times that while the album \"lacks the fragility of 1984's Some Great Reward or the earned attitude of 1990's Violator, it's unmistakably an attempt at revisiting the past, admirable either as an act of defiant stubbornness or tenacious commitment\", but also opined that \"even at its most imaginative, this is seamless Depeche Mode filler, music that could be made by any number of acolytes.\" Sounds of the Universe debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 30,537 copies\u2014the band's highest-peaking album since chart-topping Ultra (1997). However, it is their first album in their career not to contain a top 20 hit single in their homeland country. In the United States, the album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, selling 80,000 units in its first week. The album was ultimately ranked number 200 on the Billboard 200-year-end chart for 2009, and had sold 193,000 copies in the US by November 2012, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Sounds of the Universe was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 2010 Grammy Awards, but lost out to Phoenix's Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix. The album's sleeve design was voted number ten on the 2009 Best Art Vinyl poll."

A few days later (6 July) the magazine's editorial offices in central Jakarta were firebombed by two black-clad men on a motorcycle. Little damage ensued but the attack was widely presumed to be linked to the police. In the early morning hours on the day the story broke, officials presumed to be connected with the police vainly tried to buy up all the copies of the offending story. Although they purchased 30,000 copies in central Jakarta, no other areas were affected, and vendors doubled the price of the much-in-demand remainder. Tempo simply printed and supplied its distributors with 30,000 replacement copies. The action only added to the publicity surrounding the story. Tempos previous editor-in-chief is Wahyu Muryadi. Since November 2012, the position has been filled by Arif Zulkifli, the youngest editor in Tempos history. Tempo has evolved its internet presence with Tempo.co. Besides the weekly magazine, Tempo also publishes a daily newspaper, Koran Tempo. It provides semi-investigative news about political and economic issues. The newspaper is only published in Indonesian but foreign readers can read other versions, including English, at Tempo.co. Its style of journalism is different from other Indonesian daily newspapers. Tempo provides news in the style of what they call 'the story behind the story'. So, what is served to the readers is not only current events, but also the story following and behind the news."

        "content": "Elle (stylized ELLE) is a worldwide women's lifestyle magazine of French origin that focuses on fashion, beauty, health and entertainment. The title means \"she\" or \"her\" in French. It was founded in 1945 by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Gordon-Lazareff and her husband, the writer Pierre Lazareff. The magazine's readership has continuously grown since its founding, increasing to 800,000 across France by the 1960s. Elle has since expanded outside of France, creating a global network of publications and readers. Elle'''s Japanese publication was launched in 1969, defining it as the first international Elle publication of many. Previous editors of the magazine include Jean-Dominique Bauby, well known for his memoir, and Roberta Myers, the longest-serving editor-in-chief at Elle. Nina Garcia currently holds the position of editor-in-chief at Elle, appointed after the departure of Myers. Elle is considered the world's largest fashion magazine, with 46 international editions in over 60 countries. Elle magazine has over 69 million readers, with an audience of mostly women. Along with the magazine, the Elle brand includes 33 websites that stretch globally and receive 370 million monthly views. The Lagard\u00e8re Group of France owns the brand. The official Elle headquarters is located in Paris, with licensed publishers located in many other cities. HistoryElle was founded in Paris as an immediate aftermath of World War II and first sold as a supplement to France-Soir, edited at the time by Pierre Lazareff.  H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Gordon-Lazareff, Elle's pioneering founder, returned to Paris from New York City to create a unique publication that grappled with the many forces shaping the lives of women in France in 1945. Women won the right to vote in 1944, and Elle dove immediately into long-form \"newspaper-like\" features on women's role in national politics and the growing feminist movement. Its 100th issue, published on 14 October 1947, featured the work of Christian Dior just eight months after his debut show. Likewise, Brigitte Bardot had her first Elle cover at age 17, on 7 January 1952, months before her screen debut in Manina, the Girl in the Bikini. By the 1960s, Elle had a readership of 800,000 across France and was said to \"not so much reflect fashion as decree it.\" This dominance was reflected in the famous slogan: \"Si elle lit, elle lit Elle\" 'If she reads, she reads Elle. Lagard\u00e8re Group subsidiary, Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias began pushing Elle outside of Europe in 1969, launching its Japanese publication. In 1985, Elle launched in Britain and the United States. The Chinese version of the magazine was first published in 1988. It was the first four-color fashion magazine offered in China. The magazine was used as an informational and educational tool for opening of the Chinese textile market. By 1991, the magazine's sales were in decline in the U.S. In 1989, Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. launched Elle Decor magazine, focusing on home decor. Elle.com was launched in 2007. In 2011, The Hearst Corporation reached a \u20ac651M deal with Lagard\u00e8re to purchase the rights to publish Elle Magazine in fifteen countries including the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Russia and Ukraine. Lagard\u00e8re, which struggled in the international market in the 2000s, retained the rights to the French edition and would collect royalties from the international editions.Elle Brazil was the first commercial magazine in the world to have a transgender model on its cover, with Lea T. in December 2011. The Brazilian edition had also discovered transgender model Valentina Sampaio and had put her on the cover before French Vogue. Elle printed special collectors' covers for their September 2016 issue, and one of them featured Hari Nef, which was the first time an openly transgender woman had been on the cover of a major commercial British magazine. In 2019, Lagard\u00e8re sold Elle France to Czech Media Invest, parent of Czech News Center. Lagard\u00e8re continues to own the Elle brand. Notable editors-in-chief Elle editors have included Jean-Dominique Bauby, who became known for writing a book after suffering almost total paralysis, and Robbie Myers. In September 2017, it was announced that Roberta Myers was stepping down from the role of editor-in-chief, position she held since 2000, stating through a memo to the staff that \"I want to spend the next seasons as available to my children as I can be, and so I take my leave of Elle now\". A day later of the announcement, it was reported that Nina Garcia, creative director of Marie Claire was appointed as the new editor-in-chief effective 18 September. Patricia Wang was the first editor of Elle China."

        "content": "\"Bobok\" (, Bobok) is a short story by Fyodor Dostoevsky that first appeared in 1873 in his self-published Diary of a Writer. The story consists largely of a dialogue between recently deceased occupants of graves in a cemetery, most of whom are fully conscious and retain all the features of their living personalities. The dialogue is overheard by a troubled writer who has lain down near the graves. The title \"Bobok\" refers to a nonsensical utterance repeatedly made by one of the cemetery's residents, an almost completely decomposed corpse who is otherwise silent. The writer also reports a kind of auditory hallucination of the word prior to his hearing of the dialogue. The sound suggests \"little bean\" in Russian, but in the context of the story is taken to be synonymous with gibberish. The philosopher and literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin regarded Bobok as one of the finest works in the literary tradition of Menippean satire, and argues that it encapsulates many of the thematic concerns of Dostoevsky's major novels."

        "title": "Bobok_Synopsis",
        "content": "The story begins with a stream of short, self-referring internal polemics with various individuals and points of view by a frustrated writer called Ivan Ivanovich. The apparently disconnected and random nature of his speech suggests some sort of mental disturbance, possibly related to delirium tremens: his very first polemical engagement is with an acquaintance who has asked him if he will ever be sober. He is aware himself that something strange is happening to him: \"not voices exactly, but it's as if someone right beside me is saying \"Bobok, bobok, bobok!\"\" Ivan Ivanovich goes out in search of distraction and chances upon a funeral. It turns out to be that of a distant relative of his, a collegiate councillor with five unmarried daughters. He joins the procession but is ignored by his relative's family. He observes and contemplates the cemetery \u2013 the smell, the newly arrived corpses, the graves, the mourners\u2014some of whom are only pretending to mourn and others who are openly cheerful. When everyone leaves he stays at the cemetery and falls into contemplation. After sitting for a long time, his mind wandering, he lies down on a long stone coffin and is shocked to find that the voices of the recently deceased and buried seem to become audible to him. He listens to their conversation.  A variety of individuals, all disembodied continuations of their living personalities, converse and argue with each other. It seems that physical death is not final death and that here, according to the philosopher Platon Nikolaevich, \"the remnants of life are concentrated, but only in consciousness\" and continue for a time \"as if by inertia\". Despite their 'dead' status, the corpses are not only able to hear each other but to smell each other, a state of affairs that Platon Nikolaevich explains as a stench of the soul meant to bring it to a new state of awareness. Though one or two individuals show a sober and pious attitude to their situation, most of them exhibit a propensity to hold on to, and even reinforce and exaggerate, the moral failings of their earthly personalities. A new arrival called Baron Klinevich suggests that they entertain themselves and each other by revealing all the shameful details of their earthly lives, a proposal that is met with gleeful and almost universal approval. Pandemonium descends, but at this point Ivan Ivanovich suddenly sneezes, and the dead are silent thereafter.  Ivan Ivanovich leaves the cemetery distressed that depravity exists even in the grave,  \"the last moments of consciousness\". He feels that despite the desire to lose their sense of shame, the dead have a secret that they carefully conceal from mortal men. He contemplates returning to listen to their stories, and to visit other parts of the cemetery to get a fuller understanding of what is going on, but changes his mind, saying that his conscience could not allow it. However he thinks he will be able to publish his account in The Citizen."

        "title": "Bobok_Characters",
        "content": "Ivan Ivanovich, the narrator, is an alienated and cynical writer with a character comparable to that of the underground man in Notes From Underground. His writing style is concise and categorical but simultaneously ambiguous and evasive. He polemicizes with everyone \u2013 friends, editors who reject his work, the contemporary public and, after listening to the underground dialogue, with \"contemporary corpses\". Lebeziatnikov, an obsequious official with a \"soft and saccharine\" voice, is the first voice to be heard, discussing a card game played from memory with his superior, General Pervoedov. Throughout the ensuing dialogues Lebeziatnikov acts as a \"sepulchral minion\" to the General and assumes a kind of explanatory role for others in relation to 'life' in the grave. General Pervoedov, the owner of the grave directly under the narrator. In contrast to Lebeziatnikov his voice is \"weighty and authoritative\": it is clear that he wishes to maintain in the grave the dignity and importance that attached to his life on the surface. Lebeziatnikov is more than happy to play along, but others such as Avdotia Ignatievna and Baron Klinevich contemptuously dismiss his pretensions and gleefully insult him. Avdotia Ignatievna, an irritable high society lady who insults and argues with a number of the others, including a shopkeeper who lies next to her, and the General, who refers to her as a \"twittering busybody\". She has a great urge to lose her sense of shame and is delighted by Baron Klinevich's suggestion. A shopkeeper, the only participant in the dialogue who maintains a connection with the faith of the common people, and who therefore accepts death as a sacrament and interprets what is going on as the tribulations of sinful souls after death. \"A whining newcomer\", who died unexpectedly after having \"complications\" and can't accept that he is dead and buried. The narrator remembers seeing him in his coffin with a terrified and repulsive expression on his face. Baron Klinevich is a recently deceased libertine-nobleman who characterizes himself as a \"scoundrel of pseudo-high society\". He proposes to the other corpses that for their remaining time they \"cast aside all shame\" and amuse each other by not lying about themselves. He complains that in his own life he was constantly encountering moral and societal restraints on his predatory nature and that life was synonymous with lying, but that here in death they could spend their short remaining time reveling in \"shameless truthfulness\". Privy Councilor Tarasevich, a very high ranking official who died just after it was discovered that he had stolen 400,000 rubles from a government support scheme for widows and orphans. Klinevich suggests that it was those widows and orphans that \"warmed his blood\" for a life of dissipation, and Tarasevich's subsequent utterances tend to confirm this impression. Katish Berestova, a 16 year old girl who responds when addressed, but only ever with a lascivious giggle. She has \"a cracked, girlish voice, but in that voice one felt something like the prick of a needle.\" Klinevich, who knew her in life, recommends her to Tarasevich, who reacts with trembling anticipation. An engineer, newly deceased, who babbles nonsense for a time but becomes coherent and animated when Klinevich proposes the abandonment of shame. As he understands it, the Baron is proposing that they organise life in the grave on \"new and rational principles\". Platon Nikolaevich is a deceased philosopher who (according to Lebeziatnikov) explains how the life of the conscious mind and the formerly living personality continues for a short time (usually 2\u20133 months but sometimes up to 6 months) after death, but now without any associated bodily reality, concentrated somehow only in consciousness. An almost entirely decomposed corpse who (according to Lebeziatnikov) comes to life every six weeks and mutters \"Bobok, Bobok.\""

        "title": "Bobok_Themes",
        "content": "According to Mikhail Bakhtin, thematically Bobok is \"almost a microcosm of [Dostoevsky's] entire creative output.\" Among such themes are: the idea that if there is no God and no immortality of the soul then \"everything is permitted\"; the related theme of confession as \"shameless truth\" with no need of repentance; the consideration of the final moments of consciousness, connected to the themes of capital punishment and suicide in other works, for example in The Idiot; the theme of insanity; the theme of sensuality and its apparent inseparability from consciousness in any sphere; the theme of the nihilistic chaos of life and thought when they are cut off from national roots and spiritual faith. Some of the characters are abbreviated versions of types that appear in the novels. The libertine advocate of shamelessness Klinevich is a concentrated miniature of characters like Svidrigailov from Crime and Punishment, Fyodor Pavlovich from The Brothers Karamazov, and Prince Valkovsky from Humiliated and Insulted. The bitter and ironic narrator (referred to in the subtitle as \"a certain person\") is a type akin to the Underground Man in Notes From Underground. The dissipated old official who has been found to have embezzled a huge sum of public funds, the self-important General, the sycophantic but knowledgeable junior official, the Engineer with revolutionary inclinations, and the humble shopkeeper who has retained his connection to his people and his faith, are all types that are familiar to readers of Dostoevsky's larger works."

The narrator is an outsider, on the threshold between sanity and insanity, whose speech is \"internally dialogised and shot through with polemic\". In this equivocal style he discusses the relativity of reason and madness, of intelligence and stupidity, and meditates on the themes of astonishment and respect. He describes the funeral and the cemetery in a familiar and profanatory tone, with incongruous, oxymoronic combinations, and the crude naturalism, debasing and bringing-down-to-earth that is characteristic of the carnivalised literary text. The dialogue of the dead is an anacrisis played out in an extraordinary situation\u2014the final life of the conscious mind in the grave\u2014in which the corpses are provoked to fully reveal themselves, free of all the conditions, laws and obligations of ordinary life."

        "title": "Bobok_Background",
        "content": "Dostoevsky was prompted to write the story by a journalist's reaction to the first instalments of the Diary of a Writer. At the time, Dostoevsky edited the newspaper-magazine \"The Citizen\", where the first chapters of the Diary were printed. The liberal newspaper \"The Voice\" published a response to the Diary written by the journalist L. K. Panyutin (writing under the pseudonym Nil Admirari). Dostoevsky's attention was piqued by one passage in particular: \"The Diary of a Writer\" reminds one of the famous diary that ends with the exclamation \"Still, the Algerian Bey has a bump on his nose!\" [Nikolai Gogol's short story \"Diary of a Madman\"]. It is enough to look at the portrait of the author, currently exhibited at the  Academy of Arts, in which we feel for Mr. Dostoevsky the very \u201cpity\u201d that he so inappropriately mocks in his magazine. This is a portrait of a person exhausted by a serious illness. The narrator of \"Bobok\" responds to the journalist at the beginning of the story, among a stream of apparently random polemics:I am not offended, I am a timid man; but, nevertheless, they made me out to be mad. An artist happened to paint a portrait of me: \"After all,\" he says, \"you are a writer.\" So I let him have his way, and he put the portrait on exhibit. And now I read: \"Go and look at this sickly, almost insane face.\" Well, let it be so, but do they have to say it so directly in print? Everything that appears in print should be noble; ideals are necessary, but here ... The portrait is alluded to again in the closing sentences of \"Bobok\", as Ivan Ivanovich contemplates publishing an account of his experience: \"I will take it to \"the Citizen\". One of the editors there also had his portrait exhibited.\" Dostoevsky was not merely concerned with drawing attention to the journalist's tactlessness.  As in Gogol's story, the abrupt, disjointed style of the narration and the qualities of the narrator's experience suggest a man on the brink of madness, although there is an implication that it is related to alcoholism rather than the epilepsy from which Dostoevsky suffered. The narrator's polemic on the subject of astonishment seems to be aimed at Panyutin\u2019s pseudonym Nil Admirari (nihil admirari, \"not to be surprised at anything\" \u2013 Horace). According to Ivan Ivanovich:It's ridiculous, of course, to be surprized at everything, while being surprized at nothing is much more attractive and for some reason is considered good form. But it is hardly so in reality. In my opinion, being surprised at nothing is much more stupid than to be surprized at everything. And besides, to be surprized at nothing is almost the same as to respect nothing. A stupid person isn't capable of respect. The cemetery setting and dialogue was in part a satirical response to Panyutin. In 1870, Panyutin published a feuilleton in \"The Voice\" dedicated to the festivities at the Smolensk cemetery. The main character of the feuilleton also observes the behavior of the crowd in the cemetery, analyzes the \"drunken\" conversations of the still living people, and then, tired, decides to rest on one of the graves, having previously asked permission from the deceased. The dead man, allowing the weary observer to take a nap on his grave, enters into conversation with him, inquiring about the latest news from the living world."

At the top of the article he wrote:  The 8th article of 1873 is entitled \"A Half-Letter from 'A Certain Person' \", which the author of the diary describes as being by \"that same 'person', the very one who has already once distinguished himself in The Citizen on the subject of graves.\" The author of the diary discusses, in an exasperated tone, this \"person\", who has written him a long and convoluted letter in which he attacks and admonishes all sorts of people, particularly those in publishing, including the letter's addressee. The diary's author agrees to publish the letter, partly in an effort to finally appease and get rid of the \"person\". He refuses to publish the first half of the letter due to its excessive vitriol, so it begins halfway through, in the middle of a sentence."

However, the tune derives from the earlier \"Brave Willie Forster\", found in the Henry Atkinson manuscript from the 1690s, and the William Dixon manuscript, from the 1730s, both from north-east England; besides these early versions, there are two variation sets for Northumbrian smallpipes, by John Peacock, from the beginning of the 19th century, and by Tom Clough, from the early 20th century. The song is also associated with the region, having been used by the supporters of Robert Shafto (sometimes spelt Shaftoe), who was an eighteenth-century British Member of Parliament (MP) for County Durham (c. 1730\u201397), and later the borough of Downton in Wiltshire. Supporters used another verse in the 1761 election:"

        "content": "Hey for Bobby Shafto! The song is said to relate the story of how he broke the heart of Bridget Belasyse of Brancepeth Castle, County Durham, where his brother Thomas was rector, when he married Anne Duncombe of Duncombe Park in Yorkshire. Bridget Belasyse is said to have died two weeks after hearing the news. Thomas & George Allan, in their illustrated edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings (1891), argued that the \"Bobby Shafto\" of the song was in fact his son, although his father fits the description of the lyrics better. In reality, it is likely that his grandson, Robert Duncombe Shafto, also used the song for electioneering in 1861, with several of the later verses being added around this time."

The brush is native to Scotland and England, but it is more commonly found in Scotland due to its rocky territories. The name is derived from Middle English hather. Heather has several other definitions. The most commonly known is as a reference to a color mixture, it is most often a pale shade of blue from blue itself to pink to even purple mixed with gray. However, many times it refers to any color that includes gray or gray streaks within it, such as what is known as Heather fabric. The masculine form of the name is Heath."

        "content": "Newspapers.com records the use of \"Miss Heather\" in reference to a girl's name as early as 2 August 1852, in The New York Times. An infant by the name of Miss Heather Campbell arrived on a ship from Glasgow in New York, with her mother. The American Social Security Administration's records show it to already be in use in 1935, though it was rare at the time coming in at #997, barely making the top 1000 names of that era. The name is currently popular among the people of Generations X and Generation Y. The name itself peaked in popularity at #3, in 1975. Heather, though a name found primarily in English speaking countries, has other variants simply because of its definition as a flowering plant. However its foreign names often closely resemble other words with meanings so is difficult to distinguish a given variant's origin as arising from the flower, or from that of another word. For example, the name Heidi in German resembles Heidekraut, which is the German word for the Heather shrubs, though the name Heidi is usually thought to mean \"of noble birth\" (a diminutive of the name Adelheid).  The 1989 dark comedy film \"Heathers\" satirized the name by associating it with \"in-crowd\" cliques of teen-age high school girls. The name Erica actually has two meanings, one of which is related to the Heather plant whose Latin name is Ericaceae. Its other meaning of \"ruler\" is similar to that of the German meaning of Heidi. This leaves the impression that the shrub name and the meaning of \"a noble\" or \"ruler\" are similar, or it is a large coincidence."

It's a soft number, which gives the signature sound of Strings followed by \"Kahany Mohabat ki\" and \"Mera Bichara Howa Yaar\". Sohniye\", a unique and extremely jumpy number, is a treat to listen to. \"Bolo Bolo\" features Hariharan and 'Pal' featuring Sagarika has excellent background music and lyrics. \"Chaaye Chaaye\" is the liveliest. According to Bilal, Dhaani is directly related to nature if you closely go through its lyrics. The lyrics have many references to nature such as in the title track one constantly hears words like badal (clouds), nadiya (rivers) and more. Also when the duo were composing the tunes in Murree for about a month they were more exposed to the exotic beauty of the Northern areas and that gave them the idea of having green patches and open skies on the album cover."

Endgame was the first album to feature guitarist Chris Broderick, following Glen Drover's departure in 2008, and was the band's last studio album with bassist James LoMenzo until his return in 2021 as touring musician. Original bassist David Ellefson rejoined the band several months after the album's release. There are eleven tracks on the album, with lyrics inspired by subjects ranging from The Lord of the Rings and the financial crisis of 2007\u201308, to insanity, torture and crime. Two singles were released from the album: \"Head Crusher\" and \"The Right to Go Insane\"; the former was nominated for \"Best Metal Performance\" at the 2010 Grammy Awards. Endgame entered the Billboard 200 at number nine, and reached number one on the U.S. Top Hard Rock Albums chart.  As of April 2011 it has sold about 150,000 copies in the U.S. The album received positive reviews from music critics, and was thought to continue the success of the band's previous album, United Abominations (2007). In 2009, it won two Metal Storm Awards: Best Thrash Metal Album and Biggest Surprise. It was also awarded Best Album in Burrn! magazine's 2009 Readers' Poll."

The first preview from Endgame was a six-minute video featuring Sneap describing the process of mixing \"Head Crusher\" at his studio in Derbyshire, England. In the video, he called the upcoming album \"old-school\". Endgame was recorded at the band's studio, \"Vic's Garage\", in San Marcos, California. The track listing was initially revealed on July 2, 2009, although several track titles were later shortened for the final release. The album was produced by Andy Sneap, who also produced Megadeth's previous album, United Abominations. Mustaine said of the album: \"It is fast, it is heavy, there is singing, yelling, speaking, and guest voices (maybe not singing \u2013 more like in \"Captive Honour\"), the soloing is insane.\" He described it as a riff-oriented album, less melodic than the band's mid-to-late 90s material. Mustaine had saved a number of old rehearsal tapes, which were used as the album's starting point. The band members had online chats with fans on their website while recording, which according to Mustaine, helped lift the band's enthusiasm."

On May 10, 2009, Mustaine announced on TheLiveLine that some music from Megadeth would appear in the film Land of the Lost to help promote Endgame. Whether the music was to be from the album was not clear. During the message Mustaine left on TheLiveLine, it was stated there was new music playing in the background of the message. Ultimately, parts of the song \"The Right to Go Insane\", can be heard near the end of the film. Another song from the album, \"This Day We Fight!\", was used as a playable song on Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock. As promotion for Endgame, Megadeth performed \"Head Crusher\" on the September 17, 2009, edition of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Megadeth toured in support of the album, beginning in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in November 2009 and ending on December 13, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The tour featured Machine Head, Suicide Silence, Warbringer, and Arcanium. Megadeth, Slayer, and Testament were set to embark on the American Carnage tour on January 18, but it was postponed until summer due to Slayer frontman Tom Araya's undergoing back surgery."

        "content": "Endgame'''s lyrical themes are diverse. \"This Day We Fight!\" drew inspiration by Aragorn's plea to his fighters from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. \"44 Minutes\" is about the North Hollywood shootout of 1997 and the title is derived from the film 44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shoot-Out based on the event. \"1,320\" was written about nitro fuel funny cars. Mustaine said \"Bite the Hand\" was written \"about the greed of the fiduciary leaders of the financial world and how they just didn't care about the responsibility they had to the public.\" The title track was written \"about a bill that ex-President George\u00a0W. Bush signed into law that gave him the power to put American citizens in detention centers here in the United States\". \"The Hardest Part of Letting Go\u2026Sealed With a Kiss\" is a two-part song which Mustaine wrote for his wife. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand called it a \"twisted love song\". \"Head Crusher\", describes the medieval torture device of the same name. Mustaine said \"How the Story Ends\" was inspired by the teachings of Sun Tzu. Begrand describes \"The Right to Go Insane\" as \"[Mustaine's] usual 'I'm slowly going nuts' shtick\"; however, Mustaine stated the song was \"about having been wiped out, like so many Americans, from the recession and potential depression years of 2000 [sic]\"."

According to Roadrunner Records' website, a download of \"Head Crusher\" was available for 24 hours on July 7, starting at 11:00 AM Eastern Time Zone. The availability of the download ended the morning of July 8. The track was previously available for listening by calling Dave Mustaine's number through the TheLiveLine.com, a service he launched that enables musicians to connect to their audience over the phone. The song was nominated for \"Best Metal Performance\" at the 52nd annual Grammy Awards\u00a0\u2013 the band's first Grammy nomination since the 1997 song \"Trust\"\u00a0\u2013 and received a music video directed by Bill Fishman. The second single, \"The Right to Go Insane\", was released eight months later. A music video for it was released in April 2010 and featured then-recently returned bass player David Ellefson. The video's plot is roughly based on the story of Shawn Nelson, an unemployed plumber who rampaged through San Diego in a stolen M60 Patton tank. The video premiered at a show in Austin, Texas on March 26 during the anniversary tour for Rust in Peace. The song hit position 34 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks. Critical receptionEndgame received generally positive reviews from critics. Stephanie Burkett from BBC Music said the album is \"their most reliable and proficient album since Rust in Peace.\" She also noted that Megadeth \"are once again asserting their right to be considered one of the best and most consistent heavy metal groups on the planet.\" Chad Bowar of About.com awarded four and a half stars saying, \"Megadeth is still at the top of their game. Endgame has some old-school moments, but also modern ones. 2007\u2019s United Abominations garnered a lot of critical praise and was on many year-end best of lists that year... Endgame is even better.\" AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia said \"Megadeth's second release for Roadrunner, Endgame, whose title apparently refers to \"coming full circle\" rather than any sort of goodbye, and finds the latest iteration of Megadeth \u2013 debuting new guitarist Chris Broderick (ex-Nevermore, Jag Panzer) \u2013 working primarily within their technical thrash comfort zone (think Peace Sells through Rust in Peace), with only a few latter-day elements and rare experimental diversions.\" Adrien Begrand of Popmatters noted \"not a moment is wasted on Endgame\" and said \"it's all due to Mustaine sticking to his strengths, and with the extraordinarily talented Broderick as his new wingman, the record positively scorches with an intensity we haven't heard since Rust in Peace. With its furious back-and-forth solos, opening instrumental 'Dialectic Chaos' wastes no time in showcasing that dynamic between Mustaine and Broderick, and combined with the pure speed of 'This Day We Fight!', longtime fans will be instantly reminded of the bracing 'Into the Lungs of Hell'/'Set the World Afire' one-two punch that kicks off 1988's great So Far, So Good... So What!.\" Mark Eglinton of The Quietus described the album as \"a return to form\" for Megadeth. Rock guitarist Slash gave a favorable review to Endgame via Twitter.  Also, Q gave the album three stars out of five and said: \"Endgame starts with an instrumental before hitting the kind of rhythms that once earned Megadeth the tag 'state-of-the-art speed-metal-band'.\"Endgame has since been regarded as a high point of the band's later career. It follows upon two well-received predecessors, while the band started to change its musical direction on the following two albums. In 2013, WhatCulture included Endgame as number five on its \"Top 5 Megadeth albums\" list, behind Killing is My Business... and Business is Good!''."

It was edited by Marathi writer Shankar Dattatraya Javdekar from 1950 to 1952. Yadunath Thatte became Sadhana'''s editor in 1956 and continued to lead it until 1982. G.P. Pradhan was the next editor of the weekly. In the early 1970s the magazine provided a forum for voices from the Dalit Panther movement, who were revolting against the treatment of low castes in Indian society. Some of the Dalit writings published by the magazine were considered to be inflammatory by the middle class and even led to calls to ban the concerned issues. Sadhana brought the Dalit activists to the attention to the Marathi intelligentsia, and gave an impetus to the growing dalit movement. The magazine served as a voice for Socialist thought in India and played a key role in the mass awakening during the 21-month-long Emergency Rule in India that was imposed in June 1975. In July 1976, the Government of India led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi intimidated the weekly to stop publication by abusive use of national defence laws. The magazine soon reopened, after winning a landmark court case concerning press freedom in which Justice V.D. Tulzapurkar of the Bombay High Court along with Justice B.C. Gadgil quashed the government order seizing the assets of Sadhana Press'', and struck down censorship orders as arbitrary."

The object was presented in a black box-shaped coffin with the inscription \"Sextonik\"; however, the song was not performed on stage. Many websites, newspapers and radio broadcasts talked about the vibrator. Then at the concerts in Douai (Gayant Expo), St. Petersburg and Moscow, a remix of \"Sextonik\" by DJ Tomer G was played. The DJ later stated on his own site that his remix was done for a single, thus revealing that \"Sextonik\" will be the fifth single from the album. On 2 July 2009, the song was officially announced as the next single and it was revealed that it would be released under three formats: CD single, CD maxi, 7\" maxi. On 7 July 2009, a promotional digital version was sent to French stations radios. The first promotional CD was sent a few days later, then a second one on 17 July.

It was premiered in 1923 at La Scala in Milan, under the baton of Antonio Guarnieri, since Toscanini was unavailable. The cast featured Irish soprano Margaret Burke Sheridan as Candida, baritone Mariano Stabile as her lover Baldo, and tenor Francesco Merli as the titular Belfagor, a \"arcidiavolo\" who tries to marry a human maiden while in disguise as a nobleman, using gifts of money to her father. The premi\u00e8re obtained a \"full and warm\" approval, with several curtain calls for the composer, but the opinion of the critics was divided, ranging from the enthusiasm of Marinetti, enchanted by the futuristic aspects of the opera, and of the music critic S. A. Lucani, to those who judged opera and libretto absolutely not enjoyable.  wrote that this work looked like an attempt, not fully accomplished, to merge in a comic opera \"the fabolous and the clownish, the miraculous and the sentimental\" and that the comic expressivity was damaged by the absence of \"assertiveness of the melodic plan and its capacity to develop rapidly\"."

        "content": "Carpe Diem is the third studio album by Mexican singer Belinda, released on March 23, 2010, through Capitol Latin. It is primarily electropop music, a departure from the pop rock sound of her previous albums. It debuted on the Billboard Top Latin Albums at number 12, number three on the Latin Pop Albums and number 21 on the Top Heatseekers Albums. In Mexico, entered at number seven and number five in the category in Spanish. On March 25, two days after its release, Carpe Diem was certified gold; with the help of Belinda offering an autograph session in Mexico City, more than 30,000 copies were sold. The title comes from the Latin phrase that translates literally to \"Long live the day\" or \"Seize the day\", coined by the Roman poet Horace. The phrase was adopted by Belinda who was inspired by the movie Dead Poets Society. Carpe Diem contains, as described by the singer, a much happier, upbeat sound with positive lyrics as opposed to her previous album Utop\u00eda that had a darker, more personal tone to it. Among the producers are the Mexican Golden Baqueiro, who produced the theme \"Sal de mi Piel\" in Los Angeles, and Jimmy Harry, who produced the theme \"Egoista\" and worked on her previous album  Utop\u00eda. The album also features production by French artist Arno Elias, who produced the theme \"Amor Transg\u00e9nico\" as well as the participation of the Spanish Carlos Jean. Belinda composed most of the material and was involved with the image of the album along with her father, its executive producer."

In the film, canyoneer Aron Ralston must find a way to escape after he gets trapped by a boulder in an isolated slot canyon in Bluejohn Canyon, southeastern Utah, in April 2003. It is a British and American venture produced by Path\u00e9, Everest Entertainment, Film4 Productions, HandMade Films and Cloud Eight Films. The film, based on Ralston's memoir Between a Rock and a Hard Place (2004), was written by Boyle and Simon Beaufoy, co-produced by Christian Colson and John Smithson, and scored by A. R. Rahman. Beaufoy, Colson, and Rahman had all previously worked with Boyle on Slumdog Millionaire (2008). 127 Hours was well received by critics and audiences and grossed $60 million worldwide. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Franco and Best Picture. The film's title refers to the period of non-stop activity from when Ralston was stranded in Blue John Canyon once his arm was trapped underneath a boulder, to when he was rescued and resuscitated."

He befriends hikers Kristi and Megan and shows them an underground pool before they head home. After that, Aron continues on through a slot canyon in Bluejohn Canyon. While climbing, a boulder he was hanging off comes loose and causes both to fall, which traps his right arm against the wall. Aron attempts to move the boulder but it will not budge; he also soon realizes he is alone. He shortly begins recording a video diary using his camcorder to maintain morale, as he chips away parts of the boulder with a pocket knife. Over the next five days, Aron rations his food and remaining 300ml of water, struggles to keep warm at night and is forced to drink his urine when his water runs out. He also sets up a pulley using his climbing rope in a futile attempt to lift the boulder. Throughout the days, Aron becomes desperate and depressed and begins hallucinating about escape, relationships, and past experiences including his family and his former girlfriend, Rana. During one hallucination, Aron realizes that his mistake was that he did not tell anyone where he was going or for how long. On the sixth day, Aron has a vision of his future son, spurring his will to survive. He fashions a tourniquet from CamelBak tube insulation and uses a carabiner to tighten it. Then, using his knowledge of torque, he breaks the bones in his arm and, using the multi-tool, slowly amputates it. Aron then wraps the stump to prevent exsanguination and takes a picture of the boulder before rappelling down a  rockface. He then finds some rainwater collected while descending down, and drinks the stagnant water due to dehydration and continues. Back in the desert, he spots a family on a hike and calls for help. They give him water and alert the authorities; a Utah Highway Patrol helicopter brings him to a hospital. A textual epilogue reveals that years later, Aron got married and had a son. He also continues climbing, and always leaves a note telling his family where he has gone."

Despite these changes, with which he was initially uncomfortable, Ralston says the rest of the film is \"so factually accurate it is as close to a documentary as you can get and still be a drama.\" Other changes from the book include omissions of descriptions of Ralston's efforts after freeing himself: his bike was chained to itself, not to the tree as depicted at the beginning of the movie; he had to decide where to seek the fastest medical attention; he took a photo of himself at the small brown pool from which he really did drink; he had his first bowel movement of the week; he abandoned many of the items he had kept throughout his confinement; he got lost in a side canyon; and he met a family from the Netherlands (not an American family), Eric, Monique, and Andy Meijer, who already knew that he was probably lost in the area, thanks to the searches of his parents and the authorities. (The actor who plays Eric Meijer, Pieter Jan Brugge, is Dutch.) Franco is never shown uttering even an \"Ow\"; Ralston wrote that this is accurate. Ralston did send Monique and Andy to run ahead to get help, and Ralston did walk seven miles before the helicopter came, although this trek is shown in the film's alternative ending."

        "content": "Danny Boyle had been wanting to make a film about Ralston's ordeal for four years; he wrote a film treatment and Simon Beaufoy wrote the screenplay. Boyle describes 127 Hours as \"an action movie with a guy who can't move.\" He also expressed an interest for a more intimate film than his previous film, Slumdog Millionaire (2008): \"I remember thinking, I must do a film where I follow an actor the way Darren Aronofsky did with The Wrestler. So 127 Hours is my version of that.\" Boyle and Fox Searchlight announced plans to create 127 Hours in November 2009. Cillian Murphy was reportedly approached by Boyle to play Ralston. In January 2010, James Franco was cast as Ralston. In March 2010, filming began in Utah; Boyle intended to shoot the first part of the film with no dialogue. By 17 June 2010, the film was in post-production. Boyle made the very unusual move of hiring two cinematographers to work first unit, Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak, each of whom shot 50 percent of the film by trading off with each other. This allowed Boyle and Franco to work long days without wearing out the crew. Boyle enlisted makeup effects designer Tony Gardner and his effects company, Alterian, Inc., to re-create the character's amputation of his own arm. Boyle stressed that the realism of the arm as well as the process itself were key to the audience's investing in the character's experience, and that the makeup effects' success would impact the film's success. The false arm rigs were created in layers, from fiberglass and steel bone, through silicone and fibrous muscle and tendon, to functional veins and arteries, and finally skinned with a translucent silicone layer of skin with a thin layer of subcutaneous silicone fat. Gardner states that the effects work was extremely stressful, as he wanted to do justice to the story; he credits James Franco equally with the success of the effects work. Three prosthetics were used in all, with two designed to show the innards of the arm and another to emulate the outside of it. Franco would later note that seeing blood on the arm was difficult for him and his reactions in those scenes were genuine. Franco admitted that shooting the film was physically hard on him: \"There was a lot of physical pain, and Danny knew that it was going to cause a lot of pain. And I asked him after we did the movie, 'How did you know how far you could push it?' ... I had plenty of scars...Not only am I feeling physical pain, but I'm getting exhausted. It became less of a fa\u00e7ade I put on and more of an experience that I went through.\""

        "content": "Following the multi-platinum and award-winning success of her eponymous debut album in 2006, Bailey Rae began to work on songs for a follow-up album in late 2007. However, she took a hiatus from music, following the death of her husband, Scottish saxophonist Jason Rae, in March 2008 to an accidental overdose of methadone and alcohol. For a long period of time, Bailey Rae said, \"I didn't really hear any songs. Normally in my everyday life, I'd be in the car and come up with a little line, or I'd look at something and try to describe it ... I didn't really think in that way anymore. Nothing was coming in.\" After months of grief and isolation, Bailey Rae revisited her work the following year and composed additional material for The Sea. The Sea contains songs written before and after the death of Bailey Rae's husband, all of which she said resonated with her: \"The circumstances have cast it all in a different light. It began as a 'before and after' record, but it's become an 'after' record.\" The ballad \"I'd Do It All Again\" was written by Bailey Rae in January 2008 after an argument with her husband. She told NME that writing the rest of the album helped her handle the different emotions she felt after her husband's death: \"When I started writing that I was thinking, 'I don't really want this song to go into the world, 'cause it's so naked...' But I had to.\" \"I Would Like to Call it Beauty\", she said, was written about finding beauty in the \"darkest times\", later telling journalist Sean O'Hagan: Bailey Rae recorded most of The Sea in 2009 at Manchester's Limefield Studio. She co-produced the record mostly with Steve Brown and Steve Chrisanthou, both of whom had worked on her debut album. Bailey Rae pursued a sound more aggressive than on her debut. During the recording process, Bailey Rae listened to Sly and the Family Stone's 1973 album Fresh and Curtis Mayfield's 1975 album There's No Place Like America Today, as well as the music of Nina Simone and Leonard Cohen. A live band was used in the album's recording, which was also a departure from her debut. \"On the first album, it was me and a producer in a basement going through hundreds of snare drum sounds to find the right one,\" she recalled. \"With a live band, you can stretch out more and try new things out without feeling you're having to undo this meticulously built-up track.\" The album was titled after the recurring theme of water in songs such as \"Diving for Hearts\" and \"I Would Like to Call It Beauty\", while the music was said by Bailey Rae to possess \"a kind of tidal movement to it too, in the way that we recorded the songs. You know, sometimes it would just be me and my guitar. Then we'd really sort of swell up into these big arrangements, only to then retreat back to it just being me and my guitar again.\" According to Chris Mugan from The Independent, The Sea was a departure from the polished sound of Bailey Rae's debut album, while Paste magazine's Steve Labate said Bailey Rae expanded on her debut's mix of contemporary R&B and older soul music by incorporating pop rock, singer-songwriter influences, and occasional elements of bossa nova and trip hop. In the opinion of Craig McLean from The Daily Telegraph, the record's music evoked Simone's singing and the 1968 Van Morrison album Astral Weeks."

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from professional critics, the album received an average score of 78, based on 21 reviews. Reviewing the album in The Observer, Kitty Empire said it is \"saturated in feeling and graced by superior musicianship\". AllMusic's David Jeffries called it \"a testament to Rae's artistic growth\", while Steve Leftridge of PopMatters found the album \"richer\" than her debut, with a \"darker and more sophisticated sonic palette\". Q credited Bailey Rae for making The Sea never sound \"exploitative or mawkish, just truthful and real\". In the Los Angeles Times, Powers deemed the album a \"remarkable accomplishment\" and \"a step toward something\u2014Rae's inner peace, and her next artistic breakthrough\u2014that has its own considerable rewards\". Some reviewers expressed reservations. The Observers Graeme Thompson felt the album's strong points offer \"glimpses of a new horizon shining beyond the riptides of pain and sorrow\", but at times it sounds \"dull and flat\". Slant Magazines Nick Day was more critical, finding the music forgettable and the lyrics introspective but vague. Hot Press journalist Patrick Freyne believed the music exhibits an \"excessive tastefulness\" while panning the contributions of the session musicians, whom he said were \"technically proficient\" but sounded soulless. In late 2010, The Sea was named the year's best album by The Guardians Caroline Sullivan, while Powers ranked it ninth on her year-end list of 2010's best albums. Q and Uncut included the album on their respective year-end lists at numbers 22 and 37. It was also nominated for the 2010 Mercury Prize, awarded annually for the best record from the UK or Ireland; Bailey Rae lost out to The xx's self-titled debut album."

        "content": "Brothers (simplified Chinese: \u5144\u5f1f; pinyin: Xi\u014dngd\u00ec) is the longest novel written by the Chinese novelist Yu Hua, in total of 76 chapters, separately published in 2005 for the part 1 (of the first 26 chapters) and in 2006 for part 2 (of the rest 50 chapters) by Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House. This was Yu Hua's first novel after a decade or dormancy from writing and publishing works. It has over 180 thousand characters in Chinese, more than the 100 thousand characters that were originally planned for the book. It intertwines tragedy and comedy, and Yu Hua himself admits that the novel is personally his favorite literary work. Brothers was a new realm of literature for Yu Hua, with the novel often being described as extremely crude and expletive. Brothers has experienced great success with nearly 1 million copies sold in China. By 2019, Yu Hua's works had been published in 38 countries and translated into 35 different languages. This success may be contributed to his success publicity tour to gain attraction towards the novel after his hiatus from writing. While reception among Chinese critics was generally negative, the novel was shortlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize and awarded France's Prix Courrier International in 2008. It was translated into English by Eileen Cheng-yin Chow and Carlos Rojas in 2009, a couple from the Middle Eastern department at Duke University. The story of the novel revolves around the step-brotherhood between Baldy Li and Song Gang who are the protagonists. Their life that has been of absurd and tragedy throughout China's history from the 1960s to the early period of Chinese Economic Reform serves as the main plot. The division of the novel into two parts is contextually on the basis of the death of Li Lan who is the biological mother of Baldy Li and the step-mother of Song Gang. The first part primarily focuses on their childhood, especially during the Cultural Revolution with the collapse of their reorganized family and the tragedy of Song Fanping, the biological father of Song Gang and the Step-father of Baldy Li. The second part  focuses on their adulthood with different life trajectories, especially during the early period of Chinese Economic Reform that formulates the mixture of absurdity and tragedy."

        "content": "As shown in the translator's preface, even though Brothers was published in 2005 and 2006, Yu Hua \"originally conceived of the idea for the novel as early as 1995\". The process of his writing was not well-off at the beginning. However, during his seven-month trip to the United States and France in 2003, he was \"inspired\" to go back to the project while China was stuck in the \"beauty-pageant fever\". The \"Miss World competition\", \"Tourism Queen International pageant\", \"National Contest of the Beauty of the Gray-headed for contestants over fifty-five\", and \"Miss Artificial Beauty pageant for plastic surgery recipients\" are representative of the trend of absurdity in China that encouraged Yu Hua for the continuation of the novel that is of the reality of absurdity. Turns out, the reality of absurdity is demonstrated in the novel, especially in Part 2 with a fictional event called \"National Virgin Beauty Competition\". Yu Hua had expressed in an interview with Zhang Qinghua that he wanted to express some level of chaos in Brothers, which had characterized his writing throughout the 1980s to the present. The Cultural Revolution plays a major role in the novel, particularly in Part 1. The brothers have to navigate their way through the chaotic times of the political movement that happened in this time period. Yu Hua himself came of age during the Cultural Revolution. He said in the interview, \u201cThe Cultural Revolution was my formative experience, from the age of seven to seventeen, which of course would leave a significant impact\u201d. His view of violence also heavily influenced the writing of the book. He mentioned that the scene where Song Fanping - one of the main characters in the novel - was being beaten to death, was influenced by his own witness of an individual being beaten to death by the head of the revolutionary committee. The background of the author and of the Cultural Revolution with violence is significant because much of what happens in the book reflects the chaos that accompanied it."

This also demonstrates how it is a novel of survival, as Baldy Li and his family initially came from nothing, forcing Baldy Li to fight for his success as an entrepreneur. It is also considered a coming of age novel as it outlines Baldy Li's life from his early childhood to his later life.

        "content": "The novel Brothers was translated to French in 2008 and Italian in 2009, with the American and Spanish versions coming after, in such order, followed by the Hungarian, German and Dutch versions even later. This is an alternative to how Yu Hua\u2019s works often got translated as the English version would commonly be published after the European languages, e.g. French, Italian, German were released. The translation from Chinese to English for the English version of Yu Hua\u2019s Brothers was a dual effort from Eileen Cheng-yin Chow & Carlos Rojas, with Chow translating part I and Rojas part II, then revising their counterparts work. The story remains consistent with a singular narrative voice, which does not change back and forth between the two translators. The decision to have Eileen Cheng-yin Chow & Carlos Rojas translate the novel from Chinese to English, was due to Yu Hua being unable to translate the novel himself because of a family situation which arose in the period succeeding the Chinese editions publication."

However, the inheritance is saddled with debts, and the brothers must decide whether or not to accept it.  Eugene accepts the inheritance and buys off his brother's portion, thinking that he can sell off large tracts of land while making improvements to the rest.  Living alone with his mother while working on the farm, Eugene misses the relations he had with women while living in St. Petersburg.  He inquires around the village, and the watchman introduces Eugene to a local peasant named Stepanida whose husband lives away in the city.  For several months Eugene and Stepanida have encounters, with Eugene paying her each time.  Eventually, Eugene's mother thinks it is time for him to get married, preferably to an heiress who will help them with their debts.  To her disappointment, Eugene falls in love with Liza Annenskaya, a charming middle-class girl, and they are married after Eugene breaks off relations with Stepanida. After a year of marriage, Liza employs two peasant women to help with cleaning the estate.  One of them is Stepanida.  When Eugene notices her, all the passion for her that he thought was forgotten comes rushing back.  He can't stop thinking about her and decides that she must be sent away.  Liza later suffers a harmful fall while pregnant, and Eugene takes her for a rest cure to Crimea for two months on doctor's orders.  She gives birth to a daughter, and Eugene's financial prospects are starting to look promising.  His estate is described as being in the best working condition it has ever been, and he thinks he is finally happy. At a village festival, Eugene notices Stepanida dancing, and their glances re-awaken his desire.  Tormented by lust, he thinks of resuming relations with her, but realizes that the affair would cause too much of a scandal.  Eugene says of Stepanida, \"Really, she is--a devil. Simply a devil. She has possessed herself of me against my own will.\"  He convinces himself that there are only two options: to kill Stepanida, or to kill his wife and run off with Stepanida.  Eugene then thinks of a third option, which is to commit suicide.  When his family finds him dead of a revolver shot, they cannot understand why he killed himself since, although he was evidently tormented, he did not confide in his closest relatives."

The most prominent explanation is that it is composed of \"ok\" and \"z\". In various modern Turkic languages and in Proto-Turkic language \"ok(h)\" means \"arrow\". Only in Proto-Turkic language, \"ok\" also means \"clan\", and/or \"nation\". Again, only in Proto-Turkic language, \"z\" is the plural suffix. In modern Turkish \"z\" is not the plural suffix anymore, in general. Therefore \"okz\" means \"clans\", \"nations\", and/or \"arrows\". Finally, \"O\u011fuz\" is used both as given names and as names of some of the Turkic clans. O\u011fuz T\u00fcrks are the southwestern branch of Turkish clan system. \"G\u00f6ko\u011fuz\" was a group of O\u011fuz T\u00fcrks who migrated to northwest and named as Gagauz in modern times.

        "content": "Here I Am is the third studio album by American singer Kelly Rowland, released through Universal Motown and Universal Music Group on July 22, 2011. The album is Rowland's first release since parting ways with her manager Mathew Knowles and longtime Sony Music record label Columbia Records (through Knowles' Music World Entertainment). Here I Am is predominately a pop, R&B and dance album. It follows Rowland's assertion that \"no one puts her in a box\" with common themes around womanhood, sexual intimacy and love. Originally scheduled for release in 2010, the album was pushed back after the first round of singles were released to mixed critical and commercial reception. \"Commander\" (2010) produced by and featuring David Guetta topped the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and became a top-ten hit in the United Kingdom and some other European territories. Three other singles: \"Forever and a Day\", \"Rose Colored Glasses\" and \"Grown Woman\", all had limited commercial success and are subsequently included on selected editions of the album or excluded altogether. The international version of the album features seventeen songs including ones excluded from the US editions and some remixes. Here I Am also features guest performances from Lil Wayne, Nelly, Rico Love, Lil Playy, The WAV.s and Big Sean. Production of the album was handled by the likes of Rodney Jerkins, Guetta, Jim Jonsin, Hit-Boy, RedOne and The Runners. Love wrote half of the songs on the album, while Rowland co-wrote three songs on the album. After re-recording the majority of the album, a new single featuring Lil Wayne titled \"Motivation\", preceded the album in the United States. It was greeted with a positive reception from critics and topped the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart as well as peaking in the top-twenty of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Rowland's second most successful single as a lead artist in the United States. Here I Am was received well by critics, many of whom praised the strong productions and vocal performances but questioned some of the guests and a lack of the up-tempo dance sound Rowland had spoken of. Here I Am debuted at number one on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number three on the US Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 77,000\u00a0copies. To date, it's Rowland's highest debuting album in the United States."

        "title": "Here I Am (Kelly Rowland album)_Background",
        "content": "During her 2008 performances at T4 on the Beach in Weston-Super-Mare, United Kingdom, Rowland was exposed to British bands and live festival music. It inspired her to pursue a new sound for her then untitled third album. She then travelled the South of France for vacation in Summer 2008 where she was exposed to dance music. It was here that she met French disc jockey (DJ) David Guetta and heard the foundations of \"When Love Takes Over\", a song that would leave a lasting impression on the singer. After falling in love with the song, Rowland would take it back to London to write and record the vocals with Australian songwriters, The Nervo Twins. However Columbia Records were not impressed with the new sound and the record was left unfinished until it was rediscovered by Guetta, when compiling his One Love album. In March 2009, it was revealed that the singer was parting ways with Columbia Records. Speaking of her decision to leave, Rowland said, \"as a solo artist, I felt the need to explore new directions, new challenges, and new freedoms outside my comfort zone and my friends and family at Columbia have been incredibly understanding about my evolution. I want to thank everyone at Columbia for the love and support they've shown and I will never forget how many good times we've had over the years.\" It was also announced in March that Guetta was releasing \"When Love Takes Over\", his collaboration with Rowland. The song went on to be a worldwide success for the duo. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said \"the success comes at an intriguing time in Rowland's career\", having noted that she had landed a hosting job on Bravo's The Fashion Show and was in between labels. In October 2009 it was suggested that the success of the single had made Rowland consider signing a new record deal with EMI Music. Despite earlier claims, Rowland told Entertainment Weekly in 2010 that she didn't leave Columbia Records of her own accord. She was dropped because her previous album, Ms. Kelly (2007), was not commercially successful. Then in May 2010, speculation of Rowland's new record ended when an official press release revealed that she had signed to Universal Motown Records. It was whilst recording within the studios with Guetta that Rowland caught the attention of the head of Universal Motown, Sylvia Rhone, which led to the new deal. On the decision to go with Rhone's label, Rowland said \"they have really embraced me and have set me up to succeed. I decided, after careful thought, to sign with Universal Motown not only because of their track record of success, but also because they truly put their artists first\". Here I Am has a distinctly different sound to Rowland's previous albums. Simply Deep (2002) followed a rock\u2013dance sound, while Ms. Kelly featured an urban sound. However, on her third album, there are a lot of up-tempo tracks. The album is tailored specifically towards individual markets, with the US version of the album featuring more traditional R&B and pop records, while the international version of the album features more of an \"up-tempo dancey\" sound."

        "content": "In an interview with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two records she struggled to find her sound. \"I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [and management] wanted me to try it and I did it... And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007.\" She further described the songs on her previous albums as sounding very much the same, which led her to the realisation that she \"needed refreshing\". She told Entertainment Focus that meeting French DJ David Guetta \"changed her perspective and helped to inspire the new sound\". She then spent more time in Europe in 2009, something which she said had influenced her. \"It's different being over here in Europe and just being able to look at different magazines and fashion shows and things like that. And just thinking about the look and working with different stylists as well. I wanted to make sure it was a look that was all me, you know?.\" She noted that seeing people's reactions to dance music made her feel \"completely intoxicated!.\" In July 2010, Rowland said during an interview with Alex Catarinella of Paper magazine that \"I spent about a year of my life in Europe really listening to a whole bunch of European DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really loving it. 'When Love Takes Over' was my first introduction to dance music [and] it was a whole other monster. It's really a culture and I love it.\" When she was interviewed for Blues & Soul in 2010, Rowland explained that the album would blend her urban roots with a strong dance music influence. \"I'd say the main difference between this new album and my previous albums, is that this time I wasn't afraid to take a risk. I didn't care whether it was urban, dance, hip hop, WHATEVER... I just wanted a great track that I could sing and that people would enjoy.\" Part of the inspiration for the new sound on the album was wanting to do something different. In her interview with The Independent, she said \"For me, it was being kind of at a flat line with urban music and wanting something different ... when I did 'When Love Takes Over', it was easy to do it \u2013 it was almost like it happened before me in spirit and I walked right into it. ...so I knew I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction.\" Then in response to criticisms that her long-standing fans would not have their expectations met, she said \"I did not forget about my urban roots, nor will I ever ... That is one of the reasons I am here period ... I thank everyone for being so wonderful and so open to me trying something new. I won't let you down this record, I promise you.\" She expressed frustrations with the constant comparisons to Beyonc\u00e9 and opinions that urban artists should only produce urban records. Defending her decision to widen the range of genres on the new album, she said \"Nobody puts me in a box!.\" Alex Cantaranella of Paper magazine described her position on the album as \"an unassuming, poised woman who isn't fazed by the 'bullshit that comes with the territory.\" Rowland would go on to say that the album was \"a mixture of different sounds that express me and where I'm at right now in my career\", and promised that the album would be a \"defining moment\" in her career."

        "title": "Here I Am (Kelly Rowland album)_Writing and composition",
        "content": "Sessions took place in Los Angeles, New York City and Miami with Rowland specifically wanting a wide range of songs to choose from. One of the first people she actually entered the studios with was David Guetta. He co-wrote and produced the song, \"Commander\", a song with themes of taking control and being sexy. Rowland said of the song, \"I hope to see women singing the song like they're in charge. It's important to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny.\" Rico Love wrote the song and, according to Rowland, had credits on around half of the album. \"Commander\" features on the album as track number nine, while its urban remix featuring Nelly features on the deluxe edition as track fourteen. Guetta also had a hand in co-producing \"Forever and a Day\" with Danish producer Jonas Jeberg. The song was written by Sam Watters, Andre Merrit, Jeberg and Rowland. During the album's New York listening party in June 2010, \"Forever and Day\" was described by Honey Mag as a display of Rowland's \"vocals\" with \"long-winded riffs and sky-high notes.\" It was released as a single in some international markets in September 2010. Aside from Guetta, Rowland was reunited with The Nervo Twins who previously helped Rowland to write \"When Love Takes Over\". American R&B singer-songwriter Ne-Yo was also involved in the album and wrote three songs which were produced by StarGate. When describing the process of working with him, Rowland said, \"Ne-Yo asked me what I wanted to talk about, and I replied 'I'm in a different space. Change is very comfortable for me, and I'm happy where I am'.\" The first of these records, \"Shake Them Haters Off\", was originally intended to be a single in the US. It is an \"up-tempo\" and fun record with lyrics such as \"Its like a job I that I never get a break from/because haters never take a vacation.\" Another collaboration titled \"Grown Ass Woman\" (later changed to \"Grown Woman\") was described by Rowland as her favorite song on the album. Ne-Yo conceptualized the song in a three-minute conversation with Rowland, where she told him she wanted a record where she could claim \"I'm grown!\". According to Janine Simon from Honey Mag, on \"Grown [Ass] Woman\" Rowland digs \"through old pictures from the Destiny's Child days reflecting on how far she has come yet how 'Grown and silly' she still is.\" It would later be released as one of the album's two US lead singles. The pair collaborated on a third song, \"Heaven n Earth\", described by Simon as a ballad using imagery to demonstrate a \"sonic portrait, painted with flecks of sentiment; a picture of what the singer believes is what 'we deserve as a people'.\" According to Rowland, one of these three records was also recorded as a duet featuring Ne-Yo's vocals. None of these songs made the album apart from \"Heaven n Earth\", which features as song number eleven on the deluxe edition. Ester Dean and Dr. Luke also worked on the album, respectively writing and producing the other US lead single \"Rose Colored Glasses\". The song's lyrics portray \"the issues that arise when one plays the fool in a relationship.\" During Rowland's concert series for iheartradio, the singer took time out to reflect on the song. She recalled, \"The first time I heard the song it made me think of all of the relationships where I had to wear rose-colored glasses.\" It was also revealed that, during the studio recording session with Dean, she began to cry at the thought of all the \"toxic relationships\" she had been in \"where she needed to leave.\" Later in an interview with The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland said that the song had taken its toll on her. She said \"It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen.\" Dean also worked alongside Rowland during last minute studio sessions with producer Tricky Stewart, which spawned a female empowerment song called \"I'm Dat Chick\". Although \"Rose Colored Glasses\" was omitted from the US track listing, Dean's song \"I'm Dat Chick\" made the album appearing as the opening song. Written as a \"confidence-boosting\" anthem, \"I'm Dat Chick\" is built around an urban-electro club beat designed to get \"even shy women to come out of their shells\" according to Rap-Up magazine. Meanwhile, Dean's third contribution, \"Lay It on Me\", features rapper Big Sean and centers on an up-tempo R&B melody with 808s and high NRG-led production. It features a \"tinkling piano\" melody and light R&B beat. \"Take Everything\", another song recorded for the album, is one of several songs written by Love and produced by Jim Jonsin and was the first record that Rowland recorded with the duo. Jonsin praised his studio sessions with Rowland, describing the new sound as Donna Summer-esque. During an interview with 103.5 KTU FM, she accidentally revealed she had collaborated with Pitbull, but it was not until August 15, 2010, during an interview with 97.9 The Box FM, that it was revealed that he features on \"Take Everything\". Another song written and produced by the duo is titled \"Motivation\" featuring Lil Wayne. It was released as the album's lead single in April 2011. Speaking of how the record came about, Rowland said \"'Motivation' came about when I was in the studio with [producers] Jim Jonsin and Rico Love, and we kind of were just vibing. I told Rico I wanted something really sexy ... and he came up with 'Motivation' along with Jim. It turned into this amazing record... I played [\u00a0'Motivation' for Lil Wayne\u00a0] and he got on it, and it was just as simple as that.\" The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body, and are accompanied by a \"synth-saturated beat\" produced by Jonsin. In terms of instruments, \"Motivation\" uses sparse keyboard notes, programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus. Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland's seductive suggestions, using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex. A press release also revealed she had worked with Salaam Remi, something which Love confirmed when he said he had worked on a song with Remi called \"Love Is the Greatest\" that he hoped would make the album. Of these recordings, only \"Motivation\" made the album appearing as song number three, while its Rebel Rock Remix appears on the deluxe edition as track thirteen. Shondrae 'Bangladesh' Crawford who is best known for producing \"Diva\" and \"Video Phone\" by Rowland's ex-bandmate and close friend Beyonc\u00e9, revealed to Rap-Up that he had also been in the studio with Rowland. Of the collaborations, Bangladesh said, \"the music that we've done is just hard, it's edgy, but it's still sexy, and it's not raunchy ... What I like to do when I go in with artists, I like to recreate and reinvent 'em, even if they didn't need that.\" Another song recorded for the album was the Brian Kennedy-produced dance song \"On and On\" which was written by Kennedy, Merritt, Rowland and Robert Allen. \"On and On\" was used in episode fifteen of the MTV reality TV series The Hills. Both Bangladesh and Kennedy productions are omitted from the album. Other studio sessions took place with Akon, while new writing sessions were planned with season eight American Idol runner-up Adam Lambert. No songs from either Akon or Lambert appear on the US track listing. In September 2010 it was also confirmed that Stewart's fellow songwriting and production partner, The-Dream, had joined his studio sessions with Rowland. Rap-Up reported that The-Dream had been staying in New York City where he was penning songs for Rowland to record. Then on September 5, 2010, songwriter and producer Jermaine Dupri, revealed in his Living the Life series that he was in the studio with Rowland recording material for the album. In the second of these videos, songwriter Bryan-Michael Cox was also present during sessions with Rowland and Dupri. It was later revealed that the opportunity and desire to schedule more recording sessions with the duo led to the album's pushback into 2011. None of the tracks with Dupri, Cox or The-Dream made the album. In January 2011, during a trip to London, it was revealed that Gucci Mane, Lil Wayne and Rick Ross would all appear on the album. Although by the time the track listing was revealed, only Wayne's song features while rappers Mane and Ross were replaced with new songs, respectively featuring Big Sean, Lil Playy and Love. Love features on the 2 Live Crew-sampling \"All of the Night\". Using elements of \"One and One\", the steamy duet sees \"Rowland comparing her bedroom activities to music.\" Love also co-wrote and co-produced another R&B midtempo for the album titled \"Feeling Me Right Now\", where the lyrics describe what it is like to find \"self-love\" in the club. The final Love-penned song which appears on the album is titled \"Each Other\" and was co-written/co-produced by Souldiggaz. Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins scores two songs on the album, including the Lil Playy-assisted \"Work It Man\". Beginning with a strong piano riff, the song picks up its tempo resulting in a \"speaker-banger.\" The lyrics see Rowland telling listeners what kind of man she wants. \"Turn It Up\", another Darkchild production, features a synth-heavy production with lyrics about having a good time and allowing karma to deal with a cheating partner. Joseph \"Lonny\" Bereal helped Rowland and two others to co-write \"Keep It Between Us\", a song that appears as the eighth song on the album. In February 2011, during New York Fashion Week, Rowland confirmed that she also had sessions arranged with RedOne, which led to the conception of the album's tenth song, a Eurodance song called \"Down for Whatever\", co-produced by The WAV.s and Jimmy Joker. Rowland revealed in August 2010 that she would be releasing a different, \"more up-tempo dancey\" version of the album in international territories after she experienced more success with dance music internationally. With the album beginning production from as early as late 2008, Rowland completed a number of songs with a wide range of producers, some of which did not make the US version of the album. Rowland confirmed in July 2011 that the European track listing would consist of leftover songs from the album's recording sessions as well as songs from the US version and some newly recorded songs. The international version of the album features the original ten songs from the standard edition plus: \"Heaven n Earth\" and \"Each Other\" from the deluxe edition, as well as \"When Love Takes Over\" (with Guetta), \"Rose Colored Glasses\", \"Motivation (Diplo Remix)\", \"Forever and a Day\" and \"What a Feeling\" (with Alex Gaudino), all excluded from the US edition of the album."

Subsequently, during an interview with Paper magazine the following month, Rowland announced that the self-titled album would \"introduce Kelly Rowland being Kelly Rowland,\" with a wide range of records. She said, \"I'm the most confident I've been on a record ever. And it's by myself. I love it.\" Kelly Rowland was due to arrive in stores on September 14, 2010. However, just days after the interview, the singer said she was having second thoughts about the name. A facility was set up whereby fans could suggest new names through Rowland's official website. The album was also pushed back a week, though no reason was given. This would be swiftly followed by another announcement that Rowland had seized the opportunity for new studio sessions with Akon and Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart (respectively) and hence the album would now come out on October 26, 2010 The album was pushed back a fourth time, by one week with no reason give. In an interview with JLB Mornings on WJLB Radio, Rowland would go to explain that part of the reasons for the constant pushbacks were her desires to perfect the album. This was followed by another pushback to November 9, 2010, and an announcement on The Today Show that despite numerous false reports and rumors, the album was still missing a title. She said \"I saw one blog saying that the album was called One Woman Show, [and] that's totally never been the case.\" Expanding further she said that \"the title has to work with the tracks that make the record, and that's why even though there have been some good suggestions from fans I can't decide on one that fits\". Then on September 11, 2010, during New York Fashion Week, Rowland broke the news that the album was incomplete and would now be released in 2011 so that she could work with R&B songwriting and production duo Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox. Also in mid-late September it was revealed that three new names had been shortlisted for the album, including one suggested by a fan. Then some eight months after revealing that three names had been shortlisted for the album, Rowland gave an exclusive interview with Billboard, where she revealed that the album would be called Here I Am. In the interview she said:  After receiving a release date of Fall 2011, the album was moved up to July 26, 2011, following the success of the album's lead single \"Motivation\". Rowland had previously said that she had intended to release two alternative versions of the album, one for the US and a more up-tempo dance version for international markets. A new version of the album was released in the United Kingdom on November 28, 2011, coinciding with Rowland's new job as a judge on series eight of The X Factor UK. Rowland released Here I Am in the UK with a performance on the show."

        "content": "The promotional trail for the project began in March 2010 when Rowland performed at Cathy Guetta's Fuck Me I'm Famous party at the Winter Music Conference in Miami. Following this, Rowland held an album listening party at Hudson Hall in New York City on June 17, 2010. During the party, Rowland was interviewed by Gayle King while introducing songs from the album. Among those played were, \"Rose Colored Glasses\", \"Shake Them Haters Off\", \"Grown [Ass] Woman\", \"Forever and a Day\" and \"Heaven n Earth\". From as far back as January 12, 2010, Rowland gave magazine interviews about the album including spreads with New!, Take 5, and Musicology magazine. In June 2010, she appeared in the United Kingdom giving interviews with various radio stations, including Gaydar. Rowland also performed at a second Fuck Me I'm Famous party, this time in Paris on June 25 and 26. She was interviewed for UK entertainment site 'Entertainment Focus' during her promotional tour in London, UK, before returning to the US on July 3, 2010, to host the Independence Day (July 4) celebrations at the Pure nightclub in Las Vegas. These performances were reprised at 103.5 KTU's Beatstock 2010 in New York on July 8 and 9. Then for a week beginning on July 26, 2010, Rowland flew to Australia to help the Optus mobile network to launch the iPhone 4. Part of the promotion included her performing a mini-concert for the network's customers. She also performed at the 2010 FlavaMen Blatino Awards afterparty. Rowland performed for an exclusive audience of fans at the Gramercy Theatre, New York City on August 26, 2010, where she played a mini-set of new and old songs, as well as performing at the 'Ladies Night' during the Atlanta Black Gay Pride weekend on September 3 to 5, 2010. However, not all of the promotion went as planned; the New York Post reported that Rowland had lip-synced during her performances at the P.C. Richard and Son Theatre for the iheartradio concert season. According to the Post, \"Rowland was upset because she knew she didn't rock the house. The next day, reps for her Universal Motown label told Clear Channel suits, who handled the iheartradio Concert Series, they couldn't use the show for an online video.\" They also alleged that she had lip-synced at the KTU Beatstock festival, something which her representative said was not true as she sang \"live to track\". On June 26, 2011, Rowland took to the stage of the 2011 BET Awards to perform \"Motivation\" for the first time. Rowland promoted the album with live performances on televised shows, including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on July 29, 2011 and on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on September 26, 2011. Throughout September and October 2011, she was a supporting act for Chris Brown's North American leg of his F.A.M.E. Tour. A music video for the song, \"Keep It Between Us\", was released on January 25, 2012, and shows actor Lance Gross playing Rowland's love interest. In April 2012, Rowland travelled to Australia as one of the performing acts at its largest urban music festival, Supafest."

        "content": "\"Commander\" was unveiled as Here I Ams first single during the 2010 Winter Music Conference on March 27, 2010. It features and was produced by French disc jockey (DJ) David Guetta, and was released from May 17, 2010, to iTunes Stores around the world for digital download. Upon release the single was met with positive reception from music critics who praised the dance sound of the song. In the United Kingdom, \"Commander\" topped the UK Dance Chart and became a top-ten hit on the UK Singles Chart, and Rowland's best chart position since 2008. Despite not being serviced as a single in the United States, it managed to top the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Initially in the United States, separate pop and R&B singles were planned to be serviced to radio in a dual release strategy. The first of these singles, the Dr. Luke-produced \"Rose Colored Glasses\" was serviced to contemporary hit radio and released for digital download on June 29, 2010. It received praise for showcasing a \"trademark classy, controlled delivery\" from Rowland, and \"real strength is in its story and theme, that carries an emotional weight that Commanders talk of 'dance floor loving' could never reach.\" Despite this, the single only managed to peak at number thirty-nine on the US Top 40 Airplay chart, as compiled by Media Base. The second of the aforementioned dual singles for the US market, the R&B single \"Grown Woman\", (produced by StarGate) was serviced to urban, rhythmic and urban adult contemporary radios on June 29, 2010, with a digital release coming later on. It was slightly more successful than \"Rose Colored Glasses\", managing to peak at number fifty-one in its third week on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. While \"Rose Colored Glasses\" was featured on the international edition of the album, \"Grown Woman\" was excluded from both versions. International markets were serviced with a second single, \"Forever and a Day\", that was produced by Jonas Jeberg and co-produced by Guetta. It premiered via BBC Radio 1 on August 18, 2010, and was released from September 20, 2010. Despite receiving praise of Rowland's strong vocals, the single failed to match the success of \"Commander\", peaking at number forty-nine on the UK Singles Chart. After the failed attempt to launch the album with the dual US releases of \"Rose Colored Glasses\" and \"Grown Woman\", Rowland announced that the album would be rebooted with a brand new lead single for the US market. In April 2011, Rowland released the new lead single \"Motivation\" featuring Lil Wayne, replacing the previous lead singles. It was produced by Jim Jonsin with a synth-saturated beat. The single was praised for its sex appeal, and upon release peaked at number seventeen on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as peaking at number one on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. \"Motivation\" became Rowland's highest-charting single on the R&B format as a solo lead artist, and achieved the highest Hot 100 debut of her career. Ultimately it became Rowland's second-highest-charting single, and the only single from Here I Am to chart on the Hot 100. The next US single was \"Lay It on Me\" featuring rapper Big Sean. Billboard described \"Lay It on Me\" is an uptempo song, led by an 808 and a hi-NRG piano introduction with production by Hitboy. The single received positive praise from critics, who felt it was catchy and sexy. \"Lay It on Me\" was sent to rhythmic radio on August 16, 2011, and to urban radio on September 6, 2011. The video for \"Lay It on Me\" was filmed in early September 2011, and was directed by British fashion photographer/director Sarah Chatfield and choreographer Frank Gatson, Jr., both of whom had worked with Rowland on the video for \"Motivation\". The music video was released on October 12, 2011. The next international single was the RedOne-produced \"Down for Whatever\" featuring The WAV.s. The music video for \"Down for Whatever\" was also filmed in early September 2011 and directed by Chatfield and Gatson, Jr. \"Down for Whatever\" impacted UK radio on September 16, 2011 and the music video was released on October 18, 2011. \"Down for Whatever\" was released in New Zealand and Australia on October 26, 2011, in Germany on November 4, 2011, and in the UK on November 20, 2011. The music video for the single \"Keep It Between Us\" was filmed in November 2011 in Paris; actor Lance Gross plays Rowland's love interest in the video."

        "content": "Here I Am received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on sixteen reviews, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\". Allmusic editor Andy Kellman gave Here I Am four out of five stars and complimented its  appeal to \"hip-hop and R&B\" radio, adding that \"Although very eclectic taste is required to appreciate in full, this is clearly Rowland's brightest, most confident album yet.\" Entertainment Weeklys Adam Markovitz gave Here I Am a B rating and called it \"a solid if unambitious set of medium-hot finger snappers.\" Simon Gage from the Daily Express called Here I Am a \"jumping\" collection of up-tempo songs comparable to Donna Summer, but \"broadly much tougher and maybe just a tad over-processed.\" Gage added that Rowland could include Here I Am amongst her other career highlights such as her singles \"Work\" (2008) and \"When Love Takes Over\" (2009 collaboration with David Guetta), as well as her judging role on series 8 of The X Factor (UK). The A.V. Clubs Evan Rytlewski called Here I Am a declaration of Rowland's liberation. Rytlewski attributed the album's appeal to the producers, who he felt \"drove forward the sound\" and prevented Rowland from taking \"songs too seriously\" as done on Simply Deep. He concluded his review by also praising Rowland's choice to include elements of dance music. Elyssa Garnder from USA Today gave the album a mixed review, stating that \"Rowland traverses the gamut of predictable romantic scenarios prettily enough... alas, Here I Am proves a lot more cautious than that dare suggests.\" Jon Caramanica from the New York Times called the album both smart and surprising. \"Here I Am is something much more confident and more surprising [than expected]. It's a chewy and moody R&B album on which Ms. Rowland sounds assured and vital. Or, at minimum, is made to sound that way... Her vocals are stacked thick and placed loud in the mix, but while they're noticeable, they're not particularly notable apart from their arrangements.\" Despite finding some of its material unoriginal, Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe commented that \"Rowland makes up for her limited range with expressiveness throughout,\" while noting that the songs are centered around \"self-affirmation and confidence.\" He ended his review by stating that the album's closing track \"Down for Whatever\" had a \"pounding groove\" which should have been the sentiment for the rest of the album. Allison Stewart from The Washington Post commented that Here I Am would not establish a personality for Rowland, but it did not matter as she was in a place in her career where she did not need one. Described as a \"perfectly likeable club-centric R&B\" offering, Stewart said Rowland makes the most of the \"killer beats and a flat affect\" trends in the industry. Comments echoed by Michaelangelo Matos from the Los Angeles Times whose scathing review criticised the \"bland material,\" particularly noting \"secondhand beats\" and awkward lyrics. Slant Magazine's Jesse Cataldo also called the album mediocre. Cataldo said \"the skimpy roster [of rappers] makes Here I Am sound distressingly bare, and depressingly short on surprises and diversion. Rowland makes up for this by pushing the sex angle, but this pose never seems entirely natural.\""

        "content": "A movie epic about emigration, roots, America, Croatia, organized crime, love, loneliness, fate, the existential measure of everyone\u2019s life, whether thatlife in monumental, ordinary, null or simply human. This taboo-theme in Croatian culture is brilliantly realized in the genre of a social psychological drama with melodramatic, criminal and adventure elements. This \u201cMichaelCiminoesque\u201d film was successfully presented in Los Angeles cinemas as the Croatian Oscar nomination - for best foreign film in 1998.\" - R. G. Tilly, 2003. Forced by poverty and possible mobilization, Jakov flees to America in 1918., as a war deserter, together with his cousin Luka. The opportunity came when Miho, the owner of the immigration hotel in Pittsburgh sends a letter to Jakov to find him a Croatian wife. A young girl Zorka leaves her home to marry Miho, revolted by the pressure of Jakov's mother, who already married her son with a bit wealthier, but unloved Ivana. In America, Miho understands the situation and instead of marrying Zorka, he is generously sending money home for Jakov's escape. Croats immigrated since the modern migrations ever started. At the beginning of the 20th century they travel mostly as the mariners, as an example four of them were on the first and final voyage of the Titanic. They are leaving in South and North America because of famine and political persecutions. The fate of many immigrants is sublimated in the fate of Jakov and Zorka."

It is based on the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd and its eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. Karl Urban stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, dystopic metropolis called Mega-City One that lies in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Dredd and his apprentice partner, Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey high-rise block of apartments and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey). Garland began writing the script in 2006, although the development of a new Judge Dredd film adaptation, unrelated to the 1995 film Judge Dredd, was not announced until December 2008. Produced by British studio DNA Films, Dredd began principal photography, using 3D cameras throughout, in November 2010. Filming took place on practical sets and locations in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Dredd was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's visual effects, casting and action, while criticism focused on excessive violence as well as a perceived lack of the satirical elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30\u201345 million. Dredd saw greater success following its home release, and has since been recognised as a cult film. The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely, but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by 2000 ADs publisher Rebellion Developments have maintained the possibility of a second film."

        "content": "In 2080, the United States is a dystopic post nuclear war wasteland known as the Cursed Earth. On the east coast lies Mega-City One, a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 serious crimes reported daily. The only force for order are the Judges, who act as judge, jury and executioner. Judge Dredd is tasked by the Chief Judge with evaluating new recruit Cassandra Anderson, a powerful psychic who marginally failed the aptitude tests to become a Judge. In a 200-storey slum tower block called Peach Trees, drug lord Madeline \"Ma-Ma\" Madrigal executes three rogue drug dealers by having them skinned alive. They are infused with Slo-Mo (an addictive new drug which reduces the user's perception of time to 1% of normal) and thrown down to the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate, and learn of a drug den which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay, whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one that carried out the executions, and Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building (closing its blast shield doors under the pretext of a security test) to prevent the Judges from leaving or summoning help. Ma-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, forcing the Judges to fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with rotary cannons that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. The Judges breach an outer wall and call for backup. Meanwhile, Ma-Ma sends her henchman Caleb to search for the Judges. When they meet, Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma-Ma. Dredd suspects Ma-Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson reads Kay's mind and learns that Peach Trees is the centre of Slo-Mo production and distribution. Anderson suggests they hide while awaiting assistance, but Dredd insists they move up the tower and pursue Ma-Ma. Judges Volt and Guthrie respond to Dredd's call, but Ma-Ma's computer expert denies them entry by persuading them the security system is malfunctioning. A pair of armed teens confront Dredd and Anderson, allowing Kay to disarm and overpower Anderson. Kay then escapes with her as hostage, and takes her to Ma-Ma's base on the top floor. While Dredd works his way towards Ma-Ma, she calls in the corrupt Judges Lex, Kaplan, Chan and Alvarez. The four relieve Volt and Guthrie from duty and are allowed into the building. Dredd encounters Chan and is suspicious that he does not ask about Anderson's status. Seeing his cover blown, Chan attacks Dredd, but is killed. Meanwhile, Kay tries to execute Anderson with her own weapon, but the pistol's DNA scanner does not recognise him and explodes, taking his hand off. She escapes and later encounters Kaplan, whom she promptly kills after reading her mind. Elsewhere, Dredd kills Alvarez but runs out of ammunition. He is subsequently shot and injured by Lex, but Dredd stalls him long enough for Anderson to arrive and kill Lex. Anderson and Dredd obtain the code to Ma-Ma's apartment from her computer expert and confront her. Ma-Ma tells Dredd that if she dies, a device on her wrist will detonate explosives on the top floors, destroying the building. Reasoning that the detonator's signal will not reach the explosives from the ground floor, Dredd forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her down the atrium to her death. In the aftermath, Anderson accepts that she has failed her evaluation by getting disarmed, and leaves. The Chief Judge asks Dredd about Anderson's performance; he responds that she has passed."

        "content": "Karl Urban as Dredd: A famed and feared Judge. Producer Allon Reich described Dredd as \"an extreme character, and he administers justice with an extreme lack of prejudice\". Urban approached the producers about joining the film. He found the role challenging because the character never removes his helmet, requiring Urban to convey emotion without using his eyes. He viewed the character as an average man with an insanely tough job in a fragmenting society and likened Dredd's heroism to that of a fireman. The role also demanded physical preparation; Urban undertook intensive physical training to become a \"beast of a man\". He also underwent weapons and technical training to learn how to operate under fire, arrest criminals and breach doors. He insisted on performing his own motorcycle stunts for the film. He played Dredd with a raspy and harsh vocal tone akin to \"a saw cutting through bone\", which he found difficult to sustain. Olivia Thirlby as Cassandra Anderson: A rookie Judge and genetic mutant with powerful psychic abilities. Anderson can sense the thoughts and emotions of others. Thirlby contrasted her character with Dredd's \"black and white\" perspective, describing Anderson as existing \"in a grey area where everything is enhanced or clouded by the fact [that] she knows what is going on in the very interior of a person\". She undertook weapons and combat training, learning to perform a roundhouse kick to make her believably physically commanding. The character was partially inspired by singer Debbie Harry. Lena Headey as Madeline \"Ma-Ma\" Madrigal: A former prostitute turned drug lord and criminal kingpin who is the sole supplier of Slo-Mo, a new and addictive drug. Headey's performance was inspired by punk-rock singer Patti Smith. Reich described the character as someone who does \"not care at all about what anybody thinks or feels and she will do, and behave, as she wants\". Headey said: \"I think of [Ma-Ma] like an old great white shark who is just waiting for someone bigger and stronger to show up and kill her\u00a0...\u00a0she's ready for it. In fact, she can't wait for it to happen\u00a0...\u00a0She's an addict, so she's dead in that way, but that last knock just hasn't come.\" Before Headey's casting, the character was described as a heavily made-up, scarred and obese older woman. Wood Harris as Kay: Ma-Ma's clansman. Harris described the character as a villain, but one that sees himself as no worse than the Judges. Harris said: \"\u00a0...\u00a0Dredd goes around literally judging and killing people if they do wrong\u00a0...\u00a0Anyone who goes against the system might end up the bad guy. So I think Kay has justified fighting that in his mind.\" The cast also includes: Domhnall Gleeson as the gang's unnamed computer expert; Warrick Grier as Ma-Ma's right-hand man Caleb; DeObia Oparei as TJ, Peach Trees' medic; Francis Chouler as Judge Guthrie, Daniel Hadebe as Judge Volt, and Rakie Ayola as the Chief Judge. Langley Kirkwood, Edwin Perry, Karl Thaning, and Michele Levin portray, respectively, the corrupt Judges Lex, Alvarez, Chan, and Kaplan. Dredd also features Junior Singo as Amos and Luke Tyler as Freel, young boys who confront Dredd; Jason Cope as Zwirner, the thug executed by Dredd during the opening scene; Joe Vaz as Big Joe, the thug that leads the confrontation outside of the med station; Scott Sparrow as Japhet, Anderson's first execution; and Nicole Bailey as Cathy, Japhet's wife, in whose apartment the Judges take refuge."

British studio DNA Films produced the film, and partnered with sales agency IM Global to sell the worldwide distribution rights. By May 2010, this partnership saw IM Global and its owner Reliance Big Pictures agree to co-finance the 3-D project with a $45 million production budget, and a schedule to begin filming in Johannesburg, South Africa in late 2010. Pete Travis was named as the film's director and Garland, Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich would produce it. Duncan Jones had previously been offered the role of director. In a 2010 interview, Jones said that his vision for the film was unconventional\u2014describing it as weird, dark, and funny\u2014and it did not mesh well with Garland's script. In September 2010, it was reported that the film would be titled Dredd. Pre-production commenced on 23 August 2010 at Cape Town Film Studios in Cape Town, South Africa. During the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International in July, Urban confirmed that he had been offered the role of Judge Dredd, and on 18 August 2010, it was reported that Urban officially had the role. In September 2010, it was announced that Thirlby would play Dredd's telepathic rookie Cassandra Anderson. In the same month during the Toronto International Film Festival, the film attracted $30 million in worldwide pre-sales to distributors in 90% of theatrical markets. The sales included a $7 million deal with British distributor Entertainment Film Distributors. On 2 November 2010, Lions Gate Entertainment secured the North American distribution rights to Dredd. Headey joined the cast as drug-dealer Ma-Ma in January 2011. Judge Dredd creator John Wagner acted as a consultant on the film. In 2012, he confirmed that it was a new adaptation of the comic material and was not a remake of the 1995 adaptation Judge Dredd, which starred Sylvester Stallone."

        "title": "Dredd_Writing",
        "content": "Garland began writing Dredd during post-production of his other writing credit Sunshine, and completed his first draft while serving as an executive producer during filming of 28 Weeks Later. Garland's draft revolved around one of Dredd's main enemies, the undead Judge Death. He described the story as a \"riff on the whole Judge system\", but that it did not work because the Judge system had not yet been established and required too much knowledge about the Judge Dredd comic from the audience. He also considered the end result too surreal and extreme. From this script, Garland decided that the story needed to be more focused and grounded. He instead considered adapting some of the notable Judge Dredd storylines, including \"Democracy\" (1986) and \"Origins\" (2006). He decided to avoid these lengthy tales in favour of a shorter, day-in-the-life story about Dredd and his function as a cop in the dystopian environment of Mega-City One. When developing the Judge Dredd character, Garland tried to closely follow that of the comic-book character, who undergoes only small personality changes over a lengthy period of time. He said: \"I didn't think Dredd could have a great epiphany, but there is definitely a change in him over the course of the movie. He makes a very clear statement at the beginning of the film which he then contradicts at the end. That's about as far as the shift goes.\" Garland intentionally gave the traditional character development to Anderson to compensate for Dredd's character stability. Discussing the film's setting within the Peach Trees Block tower, Garland said the buildings were \"like micro city states\u00a0...\u00a0you could live and die in those buildings\". He also considered that the setting met Wagner's suggestion that the future portrayed in Dredd should relate to modern ways of living. Garland named the tower after a restaurant called \"The Peach Tree\" in Shrewsbury, England, where he first met with Wagner. The budget limited his ability to represent some of the comic aspects of Mega-City One, such as robots and aliens. Throughout the production, Garland would send his script to Wagner, who would revise some of the dialogue. Urban would then further revise the script during his performance."

        "content": "The filmmakers decided that Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like \"someone who spends hours sort of steroiding himself up.\" His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an extruded eagle statuette was removed from his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality and give it a sense of realism. Garland said: \"If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he'd be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection.\" Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film. Urban said: \"He is supposed to be the faceless representative of the law and I think that is part of his enigma\u00a0...\u00a0You wouldn't get to the end of a Sergio Leone Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!' It's irrelevant.\" Dredd's signature weapon, the \"Lawgiver\" was developed as a fully operational weapon based on a 9mm firing system, capable of firing ammunition and being changed from automatic to semi-auto fire. His motorcycle \"Lawmaster\" was a modified 500cc motorcycle. A large fairing was added over the motorcycle with machine guns, an extended wheel base and the largest functional tyres possible. The vehicle was also operational and Urban insisted on riding it himself rather than relying on Chroma key visual effects. Wagner described the necessity of adaptation from the source material and said that the 1995 film's attempt to directly replicate the comic's  motorcycle was unable to steer because the tyres were too large. Garland and VFX supervisor Jon Thum began developing the Slo-Mo concept sequences in 2009 during filming for Never Let Me Go. They experimented with an effect to replicate the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs to see how long it could be used before it distracted the viewer from the story or action sequence. They continued to develop and modify the effect until the end of post-production, tweaking colours, colour saturation, image framing and camera motion. Slo-Mo scenes also feature a rainbow colour scheme and sparkle highlights to create an unreal and otherworldly effect. The filmmakers experimented with blood bags, prosthetics, shooting real bullets, and compressed air to see the effect of direct body hits in slow motion. In the finished film, compressed air was used to create impact ripples on flesh. Garland said the concept was inspired by nature documentaries that used high-speed photography to capture animals in slow motion. He said, \"You see a whale or a shark breach the water\u00a0...\u00a0then you'd stop thinking about the animal and you get transfixed by\u00a0...\u00a0how water droplets connect and touch against each other. Somehow like a real [drug] trip, sort of stepping outside it but staying attached at the same time.\" He questioned whether the technique could be used with violence to make it purely aesthetic. He said: \"Can it be so abstract that it becomes genuinely beautiful? ...really aesthetically beautiful even if someone is having their cheek blown out or their head crushing into concrete.\" Comic artist Jock provided concept art for the film design."

        "content": "With a $45 million production budget, filming began on 12 November 2010 in Cape Town and took approximately 13 weeks, with second unit photography occurring over seven weeks. Filming locations included Johannesburg and Cape Town Film Studios (Dredd was the first project filmed at the studio). The project involved a majority of Cape Town crew members and about 40 imported crew. The producers chose to film in South Africa because of the lowered cost of employing cast and crew compared to locations in Europe and North America, and government incentives that offered to rebate up to 25% of the production costs. The film was shot digitally and primarily in 3D using RED MX, SI2K and Phantom Flex high-speed cameras for the Slo-Mo sequences, producing 4,000 frames per second. Multiple camera rigs were used. Some 2D elements were converted to 3D in post-production. DNA Films' co-founder Andrew Macdonald engaged cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle to manage the shoot; it was the first time Mantle had worked with 3D. The filmmakers wanted Dredd to have a realistic, visceral look, and drew inspiration from crime and gangster films. For scenes conveying the time and space altering effects of Slo-Mo, Mantle aimed to create images that would be beautiful but disorienting. Mega-City One and its high rise towers were created in Cape Town Film Studios. Finding a suitable set for the expansive Peach Trees atrium proved difficult, and the producers did not want to build an expensive set. While observing scouting photos of Cape Town, the filmmakers noticed a large three-walled external space that looked like an interior when filmed at night. A key sequence involving Ma-Ma and her gang firing rotary cannons across the atrium in their attempt to kill Judge Dredd required ten days of filming and eight different sets inside and outside the studio which were blended together with visual effects. Visual effects supervisor Jon Thum was unable to accompany a helicopter flight to obtain planned aerial shots of Johannesburg due to last-minute flight permissions; the resulting shots were non-specific and Thum had to pick out ones that could tell the story. Mantle had to develop new rigs to obtain close-up shots. Describing the aesthetic he aimed to achieve, he said: \"I hope it will be more painterly. If we get it right, it will be a cross between Blade Runner and Clockwork Orange.\" Garland was a constant presence on the shoot; Urban turned to Garland for direction instead of Travis."

They found that replicating the comic visuals of blocks close together made the blocks appear small. Instead they allowed more space between the buildings to emphasise the larger buildings and allow for the presence of roads and cars to allow for extrapolation outside of the picture. Outcrops and appendages were added to break up the buildings' straight lines. On 7 October 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported that Travis was prohibited from participating in the editing process following creative disagreements between producers and executives. Garland took over the editing process; his contribution was considered significant enough for him to seek a co-director credit\u2014a situation considered unusual as Garland had never directed a film before and had not been in charge of any filming. The disagreement concerned a disapproval over the footage that Travis was providing. Although Travis was removed from the editing process, he was monitoring the progress of the film. On 10 October, Travis and Garland released a joint statement claiming that they had agreed on an \"unorthodox collaboration\" before production began, that Travis was still involved in the film and that Garland was not seeking a co-director credit.

He experimented with band-based music, but decided it sounded over-produced and too safe. He turned to electronic music and used 1980s-style synthesisers and modern sound modules to create various combinations and applied distortion and other effects to the result. Leonard-Morgan said, \"I was looking to create a timeless score which couldn't be placed in any particular era. So it's ended up being a cross between a modern dance track and evocative soundscapes.\" For scenes conveying the effect of the Slo-Mo narcotic, he composed new music with real instruments and then slowed the songs down to match the visuals, such that one second of his composed score could last ten minutes (slowed to 0.17% of original). He then added additional real-time score to the slowed track. An unofficially altered Justin Bieber song served as inspiration for the Slo-Mo theme. Garland said that Portishead instrumentalist Geoff Barrow \"sent me a link to a Justin Bieber song slowed down 800 times and it became this stunning trippy choral music.\" Morgan recreated the effect based on the modified track, which was used in the finished film. The film used Bieber's music as a temporary placeholder during editing before the score was finalised. The film also features songs by artists including: \"Poison Lips\" by Vitalic; \"Dubstride\" by Yann McCullough and Gemma Kicks; \"Snuffbox\" by Matt Berry; \"Pontiac Moon\" by Robert J. Walsh; and \"Jubilee (Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around)\" by Bobby Womack."

        "content": "In August 2012, the viral advertising site \"Dredd Report\" was launched, satirising the Drudge Report. The site featured a video condemning the use of Slo-Mo, and links to news about the film. A tie-in comic book was published; its plot serves as a prequel to the film's narrative and follows Ma-Ma's life as a prostitute, controlled by her pimp Lester Grimes. Ma-Ma forms a relationship with Eric\u2014the creator of Slo-Mo. Lester kills Eric for interfering with his business, Ma-Ma castrates Lester with her teeth in retaliation and Ma-Ma takes over the Slo-Mo operation. The comic was written by Judge Dredd Megazine editor Matt Smith, drawn by 2000 AD artist Henry Flint and was released on 5 September 2012. An exclusive film poster featuring artwork by Jock was released by Mondo to promote the film's appearance at the 2012 Fantastic Fest in September 2012. Dredds marketing campaign won a Golden Trailer Award for Best Thriller TV Spot for the trailer \"Big Addicted\", and received nominations for: Best Action TV Spot, Most Original TV Spot, Best Graphics in a TV Spot, Best Music TV Spot, and Best Action Poster and Most Original Poster for the Dredd motion poster. Reports indicate that Lionsgate contributed $25 million to advertising and print costs. Urban has criticised the film's marketing campaign, saying that the film had \"zero audience awareness. Nobody knew the movie was being released. Dredd represents a failure in marketing, not filmmaking.\""

In the UK, Dredd grossed \u00a31.05 million ($1.7 million) from 415 cinemas during its opening weekend. This made it the weekend's number-one film, the first film restricted to audiences over 18 years of age to do so since Saw 3D in 2010. In its second weekend, the film placed number five, earning \u00a3769,381. Dredd was primarily shown in 3D in the UK, and 2D screenings were notoriously limited as the distributor denied cinemas' requests for 2D prints; the decision was considered to have limited the film's audience where 2D was their preferred format. Dredd earned a total of $6.9 million in the UK. In North America, pre-release tracking estimated that the film would gross between $8 and $10\u00a0million during its opening weekend based on its adult rating and the poor reputation of the 1995 adaptation. The film earned $2.2 million on its opening day and finished the weekend in sixth place, grossing $6.3 million from 2,506 cinemas\u2014an average of $2,514 per cinema. The largest demographic of the opening weekend audience was over the age of 25 (69%) and male (75%). The film's North American run ended on 1 November 2012, after 42 days. Outside of the UK and North America, Dredd had its most successful total gross takings in China ($4.5 million), Russia ($4 million), and Australia ($2 million)."

        "title": "Dredd_Critical response",
        "content": "Since its premiere screening at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, Dredd received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 79%, based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Fueled by bombastic violence and impressive special effects, rooted in self-satire and deadpan humor, Dredd 3D does a remarkable job of capturing its source material's gritty spirit.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 60 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"B\" on a scale of A+ to F. Some reviewers enjoyed its take on the titular character, IGN praising it as a \"character study\". Urban's acting was frequently praised, particularly his ability to perform a characterless figure. Entertainment Weeklys Darren Franich enjoyed his \"credibly wry performance using little more than his gravelly, imitation-[Clint] Eastwood voice\u2014and his chin\". Indiewire argued that with the film, he \"continues to distinguish himself as a versatile performer who turns mimicry into emotional meaning\". Varietys Geoff Berkshire wrote the actor \"does a fine job embodying the more mythic qualities of Dredd as an upright law enforcer no lowlife would want to confront\". Thirlby's Anderson was also highlighted, such as by Berkshire for carrying the film's emotional story and said, \"one of the film's true thrills comes in watching Thirlby effortlessly balance the conflict between a Judge's merciless duties and a psychic's compassionate understanding.\" The New Statesmans Laura Sneddon noted that Dredd passed the Bechdel test, lacking in sexism or misogyny and positively portraying female characters who are no weaker, more sexualised or shown less than their male counterparts. Sneddon described Anderson as repeatedly shown to have power over men who underestimate her, while Ma-Ma displays more intelligence and sadism than any of her male gang members, and neither woman interacts with the other on the basis of their gender. Many US newspaper critics were less taken with the film. Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times called it \"a clunk-headed action picture\" that \"simply becomes a monotonous series of bad-guy confrontations\". Frank Lovece of Newsday described it as a \"soullessly gritty\" film, which apart from one believable scene involving Thirlby, is \"all tough-guy talk and humorless cynicism\". Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger called it a \"gray and ugly film\", said that there was little to draw viewers in, and wrote that apart from the drug-induced slow-motion sequences, the film offers nothing new. The Hollywood Reporters Stephen Dalton wrote that the \"dark, ironic, very British humour of the original strip\" was largely absent from the film and that \"[t]he limited location, computer game-style plot and muted humour\" of the film might disappoint some fans of the comic. Dalton also said that Urban's performance, while close to the comic, lacked something. Overall Dalton said, \"[p]itched at the right level to please original fans, but still slick and accessible enough to attract new ones, [Dredd] feels like a smart and muscular addition to the sci-fi action genre.\" The visual effects and slow-motion sequences induced by Slo-Mo received broad praise. Berkshire said that they are notable and eye-catching with \"impressively utilised 3D.\" Hewitt said the visuals were \"genuinely surreal splashes of heightened colour that\u00a0...\u00a0don't outstay their welcome. The film's use of 3D is often excellent (including the credits) and it really comes to life in the Slo-mo scenes\". Dalton said the film \"constantly impresses on a visual level, with a gritty style more akin to cult hits like District 9 or 28 Days Later than to standard Hollywood comic-book blockbusters.\" Dalton said, \"[Mantle's] first venture into 3D is a blaze of saturated colours, gorgeous high-resolution close-ups and dazzling slow-motion sequences.\" Dredd won The Art of 3D award at the 2013 Empire Awards, and was nominated for Best British Film and Best Science-fiction/Fantasy. Judge Dredd creator John Wagner, who had been critical of the 1995 adaptation, gave a positive review of Dredd. He said: \"I liked the movie. It was, unlike the first film, a true representation of Judge Dredd\u00a0...\u00a0Karl Urban was a fine Dredd and I'd be more than happy to see him in the follow-up. Olivia Thirlby excelled as Anderson\u00a0...\u00a0The character and storyline are pure Dredd.\" Dredd has been recognised as a cult film since its release. Some reviewers drew comparisons between Dredd and The Raid: Redemption, another action film released a few months earlier, noting that similar elements in setting, story, and characters made Dredd appear derivative. However, Garland and Urban explained that the timing of when the films were shot would have made plagiarism impossible."

It was also the best-selling digital download for that period. Sales spiked in the United Kingdom in June 2013, following a reported rumour that it could influence DNA Films' decision to pursue a sequel.

        "content": "At the London Film and Comic Con in July 2012, Garland said that a North American gross of over $50 million for Dredd would make sequels possible and that he had plans for a trilogy of films. A second film would focus on the origins of Dredd and Mega-City One, and a third would introduce Dredd's nemeses, the undead Judge Death and his Dark Judges. In August 2012, Garland said that a Judge Dredd television series would be a positive future step for the series. In September 2012, Garland said that he would explore the \"Origins\" and \"Democracy\" storylines, would introduce characters Judge Cal and Chopper, and would pursue the concept that Judge Dredd is a fascist. That same month, Macdonald said that further films would be made in partnership with IM Global and would likely be shot in South Africa. In March 2013, executive producer Adi Shankar said that a sequel was unlikely. In May 2013, Urban said that a sequel was still possible, noting that the film had found an audience, and the response of fans could resurrect the project. Dredd fans on Facebook launched a petition calling for a sequel. In July 2013, 2000 AD endorsed the fan petition, supporting the campaign by printing advertisements in their publications, and by September 2013 it had attracted over 80,000 signatures. In April 2013, 2000 AD released an image teasing a continuation of the film in comic book form with a release date scheduled for September 2013. The comic, titled Dredd: Underbelly, was made available in Judge Dredd Megazine #340 which was released on 18 September 2013. In October 2014, Shankar announced the production of an unofficial spinoff online series based on the Dark Judges that would be released later that month. The animated miniseries was titled Judge Dredd: Superfiend and all its six episodes were released on 27 October 2014 on YouTube. In March 2015, Garland said that a direct sequel would likely not happen in the near future, at least not with the crew involved in the original film. In 2016, Urban said that \"conversations are happening\" regarding a Dredd continuation on streaming services Netflix or Amazon Prime. In an interview in May 2016, Urban said that while the film's \"mishandled\" marketing strategy and \"unfortunate\" box office performance meant that it was \"problematic\" to try to make a sequel, \"the success it has achieved in all post-theatrical mediums has definitely strengthened the argument in favour of a sequel.\" In May 2017, a television series named Judge Dredd: Mega-City One was announced to be in development by IM Global Television and Rebellion. In August 2017, Urban stated he was in discussion to star in the series."

        "content": "Angus is a masculine given name in English. It is an Anglicised form of the Scottish Gaelic and Irish Aonghas, which is composed of Celtic elements meaning \"one\", and \"choice\". A variant spelling of the Scottish Gaelic name is Aonghus. The Irish form of the Scottish Gaelic name is Aengus. A pet form of the given name Angus is Angie, pronounced \"an-ghee\", which represents the Scottish Gaelic Angaidh. A short form of the given name Angus is Gus, which may be lengthened to Gussie. The feminine form of Angus is Angusina. The earliest form of the given name Angus, and its cognates, occurs in Adomn\u00e1n's Vita Columbae (English: \"Life of Columba\") as Oinogusius, Oinogussius. This name likely refers to a Pictish king whose name is recorded variously as Onnust, Hungus. According to historian Alex Woolf, the early Gaelic form of the name, Oengus, was borrowed from the Pictish Onuist, which appears in British as Ungust. Woolf noted that these names are all derived from the Celtic *Oinogustos. Linguist John Kneen derived this name from two Celtic elements the following way: *Oino-gustos, meaning \"one-choice\". Woolf also stated that between about AD 350 and AD 660, the Insular Celtic dialects underwent changes which included the loss of the final syllables and unstressed vowels, which affected *Oinogustos thus: *Oinogustos."

Despite being a war hero, Ignat, a disgraced Red Army locomotive driver, is sent to the camp as punishment for destroying the fastest locomotive in the Soviet Union during a reckless race. Upon arrival at the camp, Ignat quickly establishes a reputation for devotion to the labor camp's own steam railway engine. The railway line goes no further west than the camp because a bridge was washed out just before the start of the war. On a hunch, Ignat follows the line west, swims the river at the washed out bridge, and continues down the railway line. He soon discovers an abandoned steam engine trapped on the other side when the bridge washed out. Living inside the cab is a young German woman, Elsa, surviving by hunting and gathering. Having been on her own during the past years, she frequently talks to the old locomotive, calling it \"Gustav\" after her fianc\u00e8 who was killed during the war. Ignat and Elsa start out fighting each other and are unable to communicate due to the language barrier. Eventually they start to work together, both in repairing the steam engine to run, and effecting makeshift repairs to the washed out bridge. They arrive back in camp with the awful looking steam engine and continue to work together repairing it. Elsa and Ignat become isolated from camp people. Ignat for his devotion to his newly found locomotive (he paints its name \"Gustav\" on the engine in large Russian letters), and Elsa simply by hatred for Germans from the war. Camp members summon the distant political commissar, who arrives by special train. The commissar is brutal, shooting and killing a Russian woman accused wrongfully of sleeping with the Germans. He locks up Elsa in a boxcar attached to his train and departs the camp. When Ignat learns Elsa has been taken away, he chases down the commissar with \"Gustav\", running on parallel tracks. Further back, the camp's main locomotive, carrying many of the camp members, is also chasing down the commissar's train, angry over the brutality they witnessed. Ignat's engine is faster, and he manages to get ahead of the commissar's train in a winter race through the woods. He stops the Commissar by cutting him off at a set of points, and knocks him out. Later the arriving train with much of the camp personnel find the commissar and send him packing down the line on a bicycle. The final scene shows Ignat and Elsa making their escape on a railway pump car, to start a new life elsewhere in the Soviet Union."

The title song, \"Hoot\", was composed by the Danish songwriter-producers Martin Michael Larsson and Lars Halvor Jensen, of Deekay, together with the British songwriter Alex James, with the intention of creating an \"exciting up-tempo record for a female artist or group\". It was originally titled \"Bulletproof\" and written with English lyrics. \"Mistake\" is the second track and a R&B ballad with lyrics by Kwon Yuri which is about a girl who can't move on from a relationship with a guy who asked her to \"wait\" for him but in the end he found another and she blames herself for not trying harder to keep the love between them. The third track \"My Best Friend\" is a contemporary R&B song with lyrics by Wheesung that talks about each other's friendship of Girls' Generation. The fourth track \"Wake Up\" is an electropop song carrying dark synth beat-sounds with medium tempo shuffle rhythm. \"Snowy Wish\" is the fifth track and a bright dance-pop song."

Uzeyir Hajibeyov and his brother Jeyhun Hajibeyov wrote the libretto for the opera based on Azerbaijani poet Muhammad Fizuli's poem Layla and Majnun; most parts of the poem remained unchanged. Thus, the opera Leyli and Majnun became a founder of the unique new genre in musical culture of the world, which synthesizes oriental and European musical forms, resembling a dialogue of two musical cultures of East and West. This opera has been shown more than 2,000 times at the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater as well as in other countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Iran, Turkey, Georgia, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan."

        "content": "Seili is the second studio album by Finnish pop singer Jenni Vartiainen. It was released by Warner Music Finland digitally on 31 March 2010, with the official physical release following on 14 April. From 31 March to the official physical release date, the album was sold at \u20ac19 in conjunction with Ilta-Sanomat. The album was re-released on 14 January 2011, in a limited vinyl edition. The Finnish-language album, incorporating electro and synthpop elements along with melancholic piano ballads, is named after the island Seili (Sj\u00e4l\u00f6 in Swedish), located off the south-west coast of Finland. The album was produced and co-written by Jukka Immonen with Vartiainen writing also two of the songs. The main lyricists were Teemu Brunila and Mariska who contributed to the thematical dualism of the album\u2014Brunila wrote the happier songs about publicity and finding love while Mariska wrote the lyrics for the songs that deal with darker and more serious themes, such as death. Another lyricist was Paula Vesala (from the pop rock duo PMMP). Vartiainen participated more in the production than with her debut album Ihmisten edess\u00e4, by playing for example piano and kantele. Critically acclaimed for its vocals and successful combination of ballads and pop, though criticized for lack of peculiarity and a somewhat inconsistent song selection, Seili spent 62\u00a0non-consecutive weeks on the Finnish Albums Chart since its release\u2014with 15\u00a0weeks atop the chart\u2014and sold over 95,000\u00a0copies in 2010, becoming the best-selling album of 2010 in Finland. Altogether, Seili has sold over 150,000\u00a0copies since its release and currently ranks 14th in the list of the best-selling albums of all time in Finland. The album received three Emma Awards in February\u00a02011: for Album of the Year, Pop/Rock Album of the Year and Best-Selling Album of the Year. The album included also two Emma-winning songs, the gold-selling singles \"En haluu kuolla t\u00e4n\u00e4 y\u00f6n\u00e4\" and \"Miss\u00e4 muruseni on\", winning in the categories Song of the Year and Music Video of the Year, respectively. \"Nettiin\" was released as the third single and the album spawned two promotional singles, \"Duran Duran\", which sold also gold, and \"Eik\u00f6 kukaan voi meit\u00e4 pelastaa?\". \"Miss\u00e4 muruseni on\" was the major chart hit, dominating the top-three spots of the Finnish Singles Chart from August\u00a02010 to January\u00a02011 and becoming the third-best-selling single of 2011 in Finland. To promote the album, Vartiainen embarked on a concert tour titled Seili, spanning from April\u00a02010 to August\u00a02011 and consisting of 170\u00a0shows."

        "title": "Seili (album)_Background and composition",
        "content": "Thematically more polarized than its predecessor Ihmisten edess\u00e4, Seili has been described as being based on contrasts as it deals with both darker and happier themes and combines elements of classical music with pop and schlager melodies with rock. Vartiainen has said the overall inspiration for the album came from the imagery of the movie Blade Runner and songs from the 1980s she used in her programs during her figure skating career. The name of the album symbolizes \"a trip to an unknown island, an escape from normal life to the world of music\" and the content of the album places \"during the dramatical moments between 3\u00a0am and 5\u00a0am\" when a day ends a new one begins and people are, as Vartiainen has put it, \"sensitive to new ideas\", due to either fatigue or intoxication. Vartiainen attributes the dualistic nature of the album to her professional relation with the lyricists Mariska and Teemu Brunila, who Vartiainen is also friends with, saying \"Mariska knows well Vartiainen's darker, more philosophical side\". In an interview with Dome.fi in March\u00a02010, Vartiainen said that while Mariska represents the dark and serious themes such as death, Brunila with his lyrical products \"goes towards the light\" and that the point in the album is \"to reflect on life and death\". Along with the two thematical polarities, the album deals also with tricky relationships and hunger for fame, as showcased by the Western-sounding \"Nettiin\", which starts with a banjo and a bass and is literally about naked pictures, taken and publicized by an ex-boyfriend, and paratextually about the line between privacy and publicity. The album introduces also more instruments than Ihmisten edess\u00e4; Vartiainen starts the album by playing piano in the dark introitus \"Koti\" (Home). The second song \"Seili\" is also dark-themed\u2014the song is about the namesake island located in the archipelago off the coast of Turku where leprotic and mentally ill patients were sent from 17th century onwards, along with boards they could build their own coffins with. The third song and the lead single \"En haluu kuolla t\u00e4n\u00e4 y\u00f6n\u00e4\"\u2014in English, I Don't Wanna Die Tonight\u2014goes on with the theme, though with an electronic dance beat that \"emphasizes the will to live\". The fifth song and the third single \"Miss\u00e4 muruseni on\" (Where My Sweetheart Is) was written by Mariska who got the inspiration for the song while reading Indian erotic literature on her balcony on a hot summer's day. The song is a ballad where the singer talks about being far away from her loved one and asks the wind to blow to the place \"where [one's] sweetheart is\"\u2014by November\u00a02010, the lyrics had even found their way to Finnish obituaries and gravestones. The sixth, dance-influenced song and first promotional single \"Duran Duran\" is about discovering one's soulmate as the lyrics wonder whether \"this is how it feels like when you find the right one\" along with saying \"Jenni can't escape this new feeling\". Vartiainen entered new musical territories also by playing piano and kantele in the song \"Kiitt\u00e4m\u00e4t\u00f6n\" (Ungrateful), which is written by Vartiainen and Paula Vesala and deals with agony Vartiainen suffered from while growing up during high school."

        "content": "Seili has received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Most of the reviewers have been appreciative of the vocals and the successful combination of synthpop and darker ballads, but more or less critical with the notable contrast between the thumping pop song \"Nettiin\" and the rest of the album and Vartiainen's lack of peculiarity. Teemu Fiilin of the magazine Rumba gave Seili three out of five stars, saying that \"Seili follows pretty much the schlager-ish pattern of a poet girl's inflated electro-pop\". He complimented \"En haluu kuolla t\u00e4n\u00e4 y\u00f6n\u00e4\" as \"a brilliant pop song, suitable to be sung by a [then] 27-year-old Jenni Vartiainen who is enjoying her life\". Due to the accompaniment of the more poetical, dramatical and mature songs written by Mariska, Fiilin considered \"Nettiin\" \"a really epic fail\" that \"would be a lot of fun if performed by Tea Hiilloste on Kids Top 20\". He thought \"Duran Duran\" is also brilliant, but considered Vartiainen to be more talented with faster songs, because she, when singing melancholic songs, \"lags kilometers behind [singer] Chisu\". The pop rock magazine Stara said the album is not as good at first hearing as Vartiainen's debut Ihmisten edess\u00e4, but it gave the album four out five stars. The magazine complimented the aggregate of \"En haluu kuolla t\u00e4n\u00e4 y\u00f6n\u00e4\" and the beauty and elegance of \"Duran Duran\". Stara was less harsh on reviewing the inclusion of \"Nettiin\", saying the Western-themed sounds seem a bit odd, but that the song is good in its entirety. Helsingin Sanomat gave the song three out of five stars, saying the album is suitable but that \"Vartiainen does not stand out at all with the song selections and singing voice, as Chisu does\". MTV3 gave the song four and a half stars out of five, criticizing the inclusion of \"Nettiin\" for the sake of consistency and saying none of the songs are particularly catchy. However, MTV3 complimented \"Kiitt\u00e4m\u00e4t\u00f6n\", \"Duran Duran\" and \"Eik\u00f6 kukaan voi meit\u00e4 pelastaa?\" for their massive sounds and considered Seili a brilliant summer album. Writing for the rock magazine Soundi, Antti Luukkanen gave Seili three out of five stars, saying songwriters Teemu Brunila and Mariska and producer Jukka Immonen \"gain credibility for putting the dark piano ballads and the thumping pop songs into balance, creating a coherent and compact entirety\". The magazine said Vartiainen's singing voice \"saves the album\", though it regarded many of the songs as \"hypocritical\" or even \"tasteless\" (such as \"Nettiin\"). Keskisuomalainen deemed the album's rating as four stars out of five. The newspaper considered Seili \"a splendid entirety that, however, lacks that one, ingenious song that stands out from the others\", saying also that the record\u2014the name of which comes from the island where leprotic patients and the mentally ill were sent from the 17th century onwards\u2014is \"elaborate pop that deals with the most fundamental questions\". In conclusion, Keskisuomalainen said that the album is \"a successful combination of introverted ethereality, light-hearted pop and dramatical thunder\"."

The single sold gold with over 18,000\u00a0copies and was the third-best-selling single of 2011 in Finland and its music video, depicting a woman looking to the sea and singing about her yearning for her loved one, won the 2011 Emma Award for the Music Video of the Year. In 2010, the song was also the second-most-played song on the radio stations of the Finnish Broadcasting Company, the fifth-most-played on commercial radio stations and it was chosen the Finnish schlager of 2010 in a contest held by the radio station Iskelm\u00e4. On 13 December the first promotional single \"Duran Duran\" was released. Similar to \"Nettiin\" in its chart success, the song charted for 11\u00a0weeks, peaking at number\u00a010 in February 2011, but sold gold with 5,400\u00a0copies. The song \"Eik\u00f6 kukaan voi meit\u00e4 pelastaa?\" was released as the second promotional single in the spring of 2011 and its music video was released on 14 June."

The book is written in Old Turkic using the Old Turkic script (also known as \"Orkhon\" or \"Turkic runes\"); it is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.  It is also an important source for early Turkic mythology."

        "title": "Irk Bitig_British Library manuscript",
        "content": "The only extant version of the Irk Bitig is a manuscript from the Dunhuang Library Cave that is now held at the British Library (shelfmark ). The manuscript is in the form of a booklet comprising 58 folios folded in half, each page being about 13.1 \u00d7 8.1\u00a0cm in size. The pages of the booklet turn to the right (opposite to that of Western books), and the Old Turkic text is laid out in horizontal right-to-left lines running top-to-bottom down the page. The text of Irk Bitig consists of 104 pages in 52 folios (folios 5b\u201357a), with 40\u201370 characters per page. The text is written in black ink with red punctuation marks marking word division, except for the colophon on the last two pages, which is written in red ink. The first four and a half folios (including one line overwriting the start of the Old Turkic text) and the last three folios (of which one and a half folios overwrite the Old Turkic colophon) are Buddhist devotional verses written in Chinese. As the Chinese text overwrites the beginning and end of the Old Turkic text, it is believed that the text of Irk Bitig was written first, and that the blank pages at the start and end of the booklet were later filled with the Chinese Buddhist verses. The title by which the book is known, Irk Bitig, meaning \"Book of Omens\", is given at the bottom of the last page of the main text (folio 55b), but the author is not mentioned anywhere. The manuscript text is not precisely dated, but its colophon states that it was written on the 15th day of the second month of the year of the tiger at the Tayg\u00fcntan () Manichaean monastery by an anonymous monk for his \"elder brother\", General \u0130ta\u00e7uk (Sa\u014bun \u0130ta\u00e7uk). As the Library Cave was sealed in the early 11th century, it is thought that this year of the tiger must be sometime during the 9th or 10th centuries. Louis Bazin suggests that the year of the tiger could here be 930 or 942, but Gerard Clauson and Talat Tekin both date the manuscript to the 9th century (i.e. one of the years 810, 822, 834, 846, 858, 870, 882 or 894). A number of transcription errors and textual omissions have been identified in the manuscript text, which suggest that it is not an original composition but a copy of an earlier text that was probably written in the Old Uyghur script. On the basis of its linguistic features, Marcel Erdal has dated the composition of the original work to the 8th and 9th centuries, among the earliest group of Old Turkic texts."

        "content": "According to Annemarie von Gabain (1901\u20131993) the Irk Bitig is written in a \"Manichaean\" dialect of Old Turkic, reflecting the fact that it was written at a Manichaean monastery, but Clauson has noted that the language of this text is virtually identical to that of the corpus of secular inscriptions in the Old Turkic script from the Orkhon Valley, and so \"Manichaean\" is not a valid linguistic term. The British Library manuscript exhibits a number of orthographic peculiarities that may reflect the dialect of its scribe. In particular, it uses the front vowel forms of the letter s  and n  in certain situations where a back vowel form of the letters would be expected.  The manuscript also uses two signs,  (used to write the word ot meaning \"grass\") and  (used to represent a syllabic up or the letter p after the letter u), that are not attested in other manuscript texts or inscriptions. The Old Turkic text does not have any sentence punctuation, but uses two black lines in a red circle as a word separation mark in order to indicate word boundaries."

        "content": "The main text of the book comprises 65 sections, each representing a particular divination, which is headed by three groups of between one and four circles filled with red ink.  These three groups of circles are the omen (\u0131rk in Old Turkic) that are the subject of the divination, and are thought to represent the pips on a four-sided dice made from a rectangular piece of wood that would be thrown three times (or three such dice thrown once) as part of the divination ceremony.  The groups of circles are followed by a short explanation of their meaning, such as \"I am a white-spotted falcon. I enjoy sitting on a sandal-wood tree\" (no.4), \"A man comes hurriedly. He comes bringing good tiding\" (no.7), and \"An old ox was eaten by ants, gnawing around its belly. It lays down without being able to move\" (no.37).  After the explanation is a prognostication in the form \"Know thus, it is ...\" \"good\" (33 times), \"very good\" (7 times), \"bad\" (17 times) or \"very bad\" (2 times).  In a few cases the prognostication after \"know thus\" is missing. There are 64 combinations of three groups of one to four pips, but the book gives a total of sixty-five omens, with some errors, including two missing omens (3-1-1 and 1-2-4) and some duplicate omens (3-4-1 occurs three times, and 3-1-3 occurs twice). The omens comprise short stories about the world in which the nomadic Turkic people lived.  Animals feature prominently in most of the omens, sometimes domesticated animals such as horse and camels, and sometimes wild animals such as tigers and deer. When wild animals fight each other or are injured the omen is bad (nos.6, 8, 37, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 61).  Likewise, when domestic animals are mistreated, sick or stolen the omen is bad (nos. 16, 25, 39, 50, and 65). On the other hand, animals giving birth are good omens (nos. 5 and 41).  A couple of the omens show a threefold pattern of parallelism between two animals and a human: a white mare, a she-camel and a princess give birth (no. 5); young birds, fawns, and children get lost in the fog (no.15). The Sky God Tengri is featured in some of the omens (no.12, 15, 17, 38, 41, 47, 54, 60), and he is normally shown to be benign, for instance rescuing lost or exhausted animals (nos. 15 and 17).  Also featured is the god of the road, who bestows his favour on travellers (no.2), and mends old things and brings order to the country (no.48). The title Khan also features in several omens, establishing a royal camp (no.28), coming back from a victorious battle (no.34), and going hunting (no.63), which are all good omens.  Omen 63 mentions the custom of the khan killing an animal with his own hands after it has been surrounded by his retinue. After the final divination, the book concludes, \"Now, my dear sons, know thus: this book of divination is good. Thus everyone is master of his own fate.\" The divination text is written in a mix of prose and poetry, and although it does not have a fixed poetic metre, it does exhibit poetic features such as stylistic parallelism, alliteration and rhyme."

In response, his Order founded a hospice in 1410 with help from generous Roman Catholic confreres for the mentally ill under the invocation of Sancta dels Folls Do\u00f1a Nostra i Desamparats Innocents (Our Lady of the insane and the innocent; sometimes translated as Our Lady of the forsaken), whose goal was to help people with mental illness. It has been claimed that this was the first psychiatric hospital in the world. Due to the famine of the period and the high rate of orphans due to the plague, the streets were filled with orphans. The hospice was soon expanded to assist orphans and foundlings, many the result of the plague."

The album was produced by Fernando Ill\u00e1n and Cachorro L\u00f3pez. Muchas Flores earned Flores a Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album. Flores recorded songs written by Jorge Drexler, Andr\u00e9s Calamaro, Alberto Moraga and herself. The album lead single, \"C\u00f3mo Quieres Que Te Quiera\", features the participation of Raimundo Amador playing guitar and Luis Dulzaines on percussion. The release of the album was named \"the return of Rosario,\" since critics and public rejected her previous album, Jugar a la Locura (1999), a Rock-infused album. Muchas Flores proved to be a success, selling 250,000 units in Spain, aided by the singer exposure on Talk to Her, a 2002 film by Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Flores also did a small promotional tour in the United States to benefit the album, and a full length worldwide tour, which lasted two years and concluded with the recording of her following album De Mil Colores. Muchas Flores received mixed critical reviews. Chris Nickson of AllMusic gave the album 2 stars out of 5. Nickson named Flores an \"excellent singer\", with the album starting with a raw flamenco yell and flourish, but quickly becomes straight forward Latin pop without \"too many sparks flying.\""

The first two years of the magazine were difficult, but in 1875 Rosa Mulholland arrived to help out, followed shortly by friends of Father Russell, including Aubrey de Vere, John O'Hagan and Sarah Atkinson, which helped put the magazine on a firm footing. Among the early contributors to the magazine were Denis Florence MacCarthy, Lady Fullerton, Charles Gavan Duffy, Stephen Brown, Emily Hickey, Dora Sigerson, Rev. T. A. Finlay, Archbishop Healy, Rev. D. Bearne, Rose Kavanagh, John O'Leary and his sister Ellen. These were members of the Irish cultural and nationalistic circles of the time, which included the likes of W. B. Yeats and George Sigerson, and many young writers flocked to the magazine as an outlet for their talents. From the beginning there were many Protestant contributors, among them Mary Fagan and Frances Wynne. Matthew Russell was impressed by the poems of Miss Wynne, and offered to pay for the publication of some of her poems; a collection, called Whisper!, was published in 1891. Shortly after her marriage she moved with her husband to London, but died there after giving birth to their first child in 1893. Among the writers \"discovered\" by the Irish Monthly are: Oscar Wilde, M. E. Francis, Katharine Tynan, Hilaire Belloc, Canon Sheehan of Doneraile, and Alice Furlong. Gabriel Fallon was theatre critic from 1926 to 1954. The Irish Monthly ceased publication in 1954."

That day, news came out that someone lost his wallet. Quickly, Ma\u00eetre Malandain accused Ma\u00eetre Hauchecorne of stealing the wallet, and the town believed him, despite Hauchecorne's innocence. The town of Goderville did not believe Ma\u00eetre Hauchecorne was innocent, even though someone found the wallet in the street and returned it. Ma\u00eetre Hauchecorne died of a broken heart, despairing of being thought a liar."

Before the release of the album, the singles \"Dada\" and \"Ky\u014dshinsh\u014d\" were released in January and February 2011. \"Dada\" reached number one on Oricon's single charts, becoming Radwimps second single to do so since their debut. \"Kimi to Hitsuji to Ao\" was chosen as broadcaster NHK's theme song for soccer events in 2011, including the 2011 J. League Division 1, the first round of the 2012 AFC Men's Pre-Olympic Tournament in June and the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica in July. This is the band's first commercial tie-up since \"EDP (Tonde Hi ni Iru Natsu no Kimi)\"'s use as the music countdown show Count Down TV's opening theme song in early 2006. A music video, directed by Daisuke Shimada and S\u014djir\u014d Kamatani, was filmed for the song. The song was given radio play from February 23, as well as released as a ringtone. Also released as ringtones on the same day were \"Daidarabocchi, \"\"Gakugeikai,\" and \"T\u014dmei Ningen J\u016bhachi-g\u014d.\" Radwimps took part in Tower Records' No Music, No Life? advertisement campaign from March 8 until March 21, and were featured on in-store posters in Tower Records stores across Japan. The band will also make two appearances on Tokyo FM's School of Lock! on their regular program Rad Locks!, airing in April and May 2011. The band will tour across Japan between April and July 2011, on their , performing 37 dates."

        "content": "Toy is a posthumously released studio album by English musician David Bowie. It was recorded from July to October 2000 in New York City and featured re-recordings of songs Bowie recorded between 1964 and 1971, along with a couple of new tracks. The project was co-produced by Bowie and Mark Plati and featured musicians from Bowie's then-touring band\u2014Plati, Earl Slick, Gail Ann Dorsey, Mike Garson and Sterling Campbell\u2014with overdubs from Lisa Germano, Gerry Leonard and Cuong Vu. Bowie's intention for the project was to rehearse the tracks, record them live and release them as quickly as possible, predating the idea of the surprise album. Intended for release in March 2001, the album was shelved by EMI/Virgin due to financial struggles, leading Bowie to depart the label and begin work on his next album Heathen (2002). Various Toy tracks saw release as B-sides and bonus tracks in the ensuing years; two were remade for Heathen and two appeared on the Nothing Has Changed compilation in 2014. Different mixes of the Toy tracks leaked onto the Internet in 2011, which caught media attention. Ten years later, Warner Music Group announced on 29 September 2021 that Toy would get an official release as part of the box set Brilliant Adventure (1992\u20132001) on 26 November 2021, through Bowie's own ISO label and Parlophone. A separate deluxe edition, featuring previously unseen photographs, alternate mixes, proposed B-sides and 13 new remixes of the tracks, was released on 7 January 2022. The official release received positive reviews from music critics, with many highlighting Bowie's vocal performances. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number five on the UK Albums Chart, becoming Bowie's 35th UK top 10 album."

        "content": "In 1999, during the Hours Tour, David Bowie began performing songs he originally recorded in the 1960s. After ending his Mini Tour with a performance at the Glastonbury Festival in June 2000, he stated, \"I hate to waste the energy of a show-honed band so I've asked one and all if they would like to make an album immediately when we get back to New York.\" He then revealed his intention of re-recording these songs, explaining \"Not so much Pin Ups II as an Up Date I.\" Work on the \"Sixties album\" began a month later in July under the working title Toy, which came from a lyric in two songs recorded. The lineup consisted of the members of Bowie's touring band: guitarist Earl Slick, bassist Gail Ann Dorsey, pianist Mike Garson, musician Mark Plati and drummer Sterling Campbell. According to biographer David Buckley, the band rehearsed the songs at Sear Sound Studios in New York City before recording them as live tracks. Plati recalled: \"The idea was to keep it loose, fast, and not clean things up too much or dwell on perfection. As a result, we had 13 basic tracks cut in around nine days.\" Slick later told Rolling Stone: \"We had been doing a lot of gigs up to that point. We didn't have to do a whole lot of thinking about how to approach the songs. We had an operating system; an unspoken one. We hardly ever talked about anything. We'd just look at each other, or David would look at us, and it would just happen.\" He also stated that he refused to listen to Bowie's original recordings of the tracks, so to prevent the originals from influencing his playing on the new versions. Plati, whom Bowie chose to co-produce the project, was integral to the new album's sound. Pete Keppler engineered the sessions, while Bowie's former producer Tony Visconti provided string arrangements on two tracks. Recording took a two-month break in August due to the birth of Bowie and Iman's daughter Alexandria. Following the two-month break, multi-instrumentalist Lisa Germano was hired by Bowie, at Plati's suggestion, to contribute overdubs. After seeing her perform in New York for the rock band Eels in August, Plati stated \"I knew I needed to get her on the Bowie album.\" Germano was thrilled by the experience and both Bowie and Plati commended her contributions. Overdubs commenced at New York's Looking Glass Studios in October. Also hired were Gerry Leonard and Cuong Vu, who contributed guitar and trumpet, respectively. Also recorded during this time was a cover of the Who's \"Pictures of Lily\" for the tribute album Substitute: The Songs of the Who. Mixing began at the end of October, with Bowie predicting a release date of March 2001."

        "content": "Toy primarily consists of re-recordings of various songs Bowie originally recorded between 1964 and 1971, some of which with numerous bands. Author Marc Spitz describes it as \"a sort of Pin Ups without the hits\". These included: \"Liza Jane\", Bowie's 1964 debut single; \"You've Got a Habit of Leaving\", a 1965 A-side; \"Baby Loves That Way\", a 1965 B-side; \"Can't Help Thinking About Me\", a 1966 A-side; \"I Dig Everything\", a 1966 A-side; \"The London Boys\", a 1966 B-side; \"Silly Boy Blue\", first released on Bowie's 1967 eponymous debut album; \"Let Me Sleep Beside You\", \"In the Heat of the Morning\" and \"Karma Man\", rejected tracks recorded in 1967 that first appeared on The World of David Bowie compilation (1970); and \"Conversation Piece\", a 1970 B-side. Additionally, a new version of \"Shadow Man\", which dated back to the 1971 Ziggy Stardust sessions, was recorded. Many of these tracks had previously seen release on various compilation albums, such as Early On (1964\u20131966) (1991) and The Deram Anthology 1966\u20131968 (1997). Along with the re-recorded tracks, several new songs were written for the project, including \"Afraid\", \"Uncle Floyd\" and \"Toy\" (later retitled \"Your Turn to Drive\"). Bowie stated that these were written in the style he \"may have written them in the sixties\". More tracks written for Toy included \"Hole in the Ground\" and \"Miss American High\". Bowie explained on his website, BowieNet, that \"some of the songs from the sixties were never recorded, let alone released, so will be as new to you as any of the new ones that I've written.\" Regarding the tracks themselves, Bowie stated: \"The songs are so alive and full of colour, they jump out of the speakers. It's really hard to believe that they were written so long ago.\""

Plati later commented, \"Record labels just weren't set up to do that at the time\u2014too many moving parts and all the rest of it.\" Originally scheduled for release in March 2001, Toy was initially delayed to May. In June, Bowie revealed: \"EMI/Virgin seem to have a lot of scheduling conflicts this year, which has put an awful lot on the back burner. Toy is finished and ready to go, and I will make an announcement as soon as I get a very real date.\" After making Bowie's back catalogue available for digital download in 2000, the label, who were in the middle of various financial struggles, feared poor commercial performance for Toy and expressed a desire for an album of new material instead, indefinitely shelving the record. In October, Bowie responded \"Fine by me. I'm extremely happy with the new stuff...[but] I won't let Toy slide away. I'm working on a way that you'll be able to get the songs next year as well as the newie.\" Buckley argues that had it been released, Toy would have \"easily\" reached the UK top 20, even if it was only bought by Bowie's hardcore fans. As the label were negotiating, Bowie began work with Visconti on Heathen. According to Visconti, Bowie was \"hurt terribly\" by Toys rejection and as a result, left EMI/Virgin and signed an agreement with Columbia Records in early 2002 to issue Heathen via his own ISO label. Between 2002 and 2003, tracks from Toy, including \"Conversation Piece\", \"Shadow Man\", \"You've Got a Habit of Leaving\" and \"Baby Loves that Way\", appeared as various B-sides and bonus tracks. \"Afraid\" and \"Uncle Floyd\" were remade for Heathen, with the latter retitled \"Slip Away\". \"Let Me Sleep Beside You\" and \"Your Turn to Drive\" later saw official release on the three-disc edition of the 2014 compilation Nothing Has Changed. Bowie remarked in 2003:"

        "content": "In March 2011, 14 tracks from the Toy sessions, excluding \"Karma Man\" and \"Can't Help Thinking About Me\", were leaked onto the Internet, attracting media attention. The leaked tracks are different mixes compared to the officially released B-sides and bonus tracks. According to biographer Nicholas Pegg, the edits suggest that they are not final master recordings, rather tracks at an earlier stage of mixing. When asked about the leak, Plati denied any involvement, stating, \"I think someone got a rough mix on CD somehow.\" Regarding the leak overall, Pegg comments that it is \"fascinating, thrilling and beautiful \u2013 and, as is so often the case with Bowie's work, an obvious creative stepping-stone between the previous album and the next.\" Ten years later, on 29 September 2021, Warner Music Group announced that Toy would get an official release on 26 November as part of the box set Brilliant Adventure (1992\u20132001) through ISO and Parlophone. \"You've Got a Habit of Leaving\" was released as a digital single the same day. \"Karma Man\" and an \"alternative ending mix\" of \"Silly Boy Blue\" were released as the next single on 15 October, while \"Can't Help Thinking About Me\" followed on 19 November. Plati, who assisted in the mixing of the Toy material for the box set, said in a statement: A separate deluxe edition, titled Toy:Box, was released on 7 January 2022, the day before what would have been Bowie's 75th birthday. The release includes previously unseen photographs, alternate mixes, proposed B-sides and 13 new \"Unplugged and Somewhat Slightly Electric\" remixes of the Toy tracks. These remixes contain new guitar parts by Plati and Earl Slick, replicating a style done by the Rolling Stones' Keith Richards. The \"Unplugged and Somewhat Slightly Electric\" mix of \"Shadow Man\" was released as a single on streaming services on 6 January. The release ends with \"Toy (Your Turn to Drive)\", a new track compiled from an extended jam during a take of \"I Dig Everything\". Featuring updated mixing, Plati stated: \"As it was culled from 'I Dig Everything', it makes sense to bookend the album with this track. It's also a fitting postscript to the Toy era.\" Visconti, who called it Bowie's \"ghost album\", was positive about its official release, telling Uncut magazine that he believed it contained some of Bowie's finest work."

Writing for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis highlighted \"Shadow Man\" as a standout, further praising the versions of \"Conversation Piece\" and \"Let Me Sleep Beside You\". He ultimately called it \"an enjoyable curiosity rather than a major release.\" The Independents Helen Brown praised Bowie's vocal performance and the band's performance throughout the record and, like Petridis, highlighted the new versions of \"Shadow Man\" and \"Conversation Piece\". Sean T. Collins likewise commended the band's performance in Pitchfork, writing that when compared to the BBC Radio Theatre, London, June 27, 2000  live album included in the Brilliant Adventure box set, \"the intimate setting [on Toy] works much better for the session-pro players than did the festival sprawl.\" The Evening Standards David Smyth was also positive, highlighting the remade tracks as material long overdue for an official release. Brenna Ehrlich was more modest in her review for Rolling Stone, calling Toy \"a completely serviceable album\" that lacks surprises and is \"far from transcendent\". Although she similarly noted Bowie's vocal performance as the standout, Ehrlich concluded that Toy is \"supplemental material, a sidenote, a wandering walk off the main path with a friend we've been missing.\" When reviewing Brilliant Adventure, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine found the Hours-style music \"mildly appealing\" and summarised: \"it's a slight record but it's nice to have it as part of the official discography.\" Reviewing the deluxe edition, Erlewine called it a \"record out of time\", featuring songs clearly made during the 1960s with a \"Y2K-era\" production, which adds to its overall charm. However, he found the additional mixes in the deluxe edition insubstantially different from the main mixes, leading the deluxe package to be \"monotonous\"."

It is preserved in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a historical record of events in Anglo-Saxon England which was kept from the late ninth to the mid-twelfth century. The poem records the Battle of Brunanburh, a battle fought in 937 between an English army and a combined army of Scots, Vikings, and Britons. The battle resulted in an English victory, celebrated by the poem in style and language like that of traditional Old English battle poetry. The poem is notable because of those traditional elements and has been praised for its authentic tone, but it is also remarkable for its fiercely nationalistic tone, which documents the development of a unified England ruled by the House of Wessex."

After \u00c6thelstan had defeated the Vikings at York in 928, Constantine II, the Scottish King, recognised the threat posed by the House of Wessex to his own position, and began forging alliances with neighbouring kingdoms to attempt a pre-emptive strike against \u00c6thelstan. He married his daughter to Amla\u00edb mac Gofraid (also called Olaf Guthfrithsson, and Anlaf in the poem), the Norse-Gael King of Dublin. Amla\u00edb had a claim to the throne of Northumbria, from which \u00c6thelstan expelled his father in 927. Thus, the invading army combined \"Vikings, Scots, and Strathclyde Britons.\" On the English side, \u00c6thelstan was joined by his brother, the later King Edmund. In the ensuing battle, the combined forces of Wessex and Mercia won a decisive victory."

It is referred to as a panegyric celebrating the victory of \u00c6thelstan and Edmund I. The text begins by praising King \u00c6thelstan and his brother Edmund I for their victory. It mentions the fall of \"Scots and seafarers\" in a battle that lasted an entire day, while \"the battlefield flowed / with dark blood.\" \"Norse seafarer[s]\" and \"weary Scot[s]\" were killed by \"West Saxons [who] / pursued those hateful people\", killing them from behind with their swords; neither did \"the Mercians...stint / hard handplay\". \"Five young kings\" are killed in battle along with \"seven / of Anlaf's earls\". Amla\u00edb mac Gofraid (\"Anlaf\") flees by boat, and Constantine flees to: the north, leaving \"his son / savaged by weapons on that field of slaughter, / a mere boy in battle.\" The poem concludes by comparing the battle to those fought in earlier stages of English history:"

        "title": "Battle of Brunanburh (poem)_Style and tone",
        "content": "The style of the poem has been described as \"sagalike in its sparse use of language combined with ample specific detail.\" According to George Anderson, since the poem comes so late in the Old English period, it gives evidence of the continuing attraction of the \"warrior tradition\": it is \"clear and convincing testimony to the vitality of the Old English battle-epic tradition; the authentic ring sounds out years after the Beowulf Poet, Caedmon, and Cynewulf have been laid to rest.\" Donald Fry compares passages from Beowulf and Brunanburh (concerning the boarding of ships) and remarks on the \"similar diction and imagery\". According to Malcolm Godden, the language resembles that of the Old English Genesis A. The poem is not without its detractors: an early critic, Walter J. Sedgefield, in a 1904 study of the poems in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, said \"even the longest and best written of their number, the Battle of Brunanburh, is but a simulacrum, a ghost of the older epos\". That the poem should not be treated as a historical text, and that panegyric was the appropriate genre, was argued by Alistair Campbell: \"The poet's subjects are the praise of heroes and the glory of victory. When this is realised, the oft-repeated criticism, that he does not greatly add to our knowledge of the battle, falls to the ground. It was not his object to do so. He was not writing an epic or a 'ballad.' He was writing a panegyric.\" Townend agrees, and notes that praise-poems on contemporary men are completely missing from the Anglo-Saxon period until a cluster of four panegyrics including Brunanburh in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Compared to \"The Battle of Maldon\", an Old English poem that commemorates a battle between English and Vikings half a century later, Brunanburh is notable for its nationalist overtones, whereas Maldon celebrates Christian over non-Christian values. Indeed, the poem is seen as celebrating a logical progression in the development of England as a unified nation ruled by the House of Wessex; the battle reports \"the dawning of a sense of nationality, ....a crisis in which a nation is involved\". In this respect, Brunanburh is closer to the Anglo-Saxon poem The Taking of the Five Boroughs, also found in the Chronicle under the year 942, celebrating King Edmund's recapture of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. But while the poet claims veracity, Michael Swanton notes, \"it is ironic in view of his primarily historic concerns that he is in fact more successful than the Maldon-poet in transmitting the traditional poetic style.\" Peter Clemoes argues in Interactions of Thought and Language in Old English Poetry that Brunanburh, as opposed to Maldon, relies on \"uncomplicated patriotic triumphalism\". The poem does not treat \"personal responsibility\" as Maldon does, but leans on an expansive view of history which sees the battle, in line with the Chronicles view of contemporary history as the \"epitome of Anglo-Saxon, especially West Saxon, history with antecedents in the history of Britain\", as \"straightforwardly traditional\". According to Patrick Wormald, the poem builds on the \"sense of ideological identity that the English had been given by Bede.\" Accompanying the combatants are the usual \"beasts of battle\" found in other Old English poems\u2014the wolf, the raven, and the eagle. The Battle of Brunanburh, however, seems to include a fourth animal, the gu\u00fehafoc (literally Goshawk), or \"war-hawk,\" in line 64. However, editors and scholars of the poem have suggested that graedigne gu\u00fehafoc, \"greedy war-hawk\", is actually a kenning for the hasu-padan, / earn \u00e6ftan hwit, the \"dusky coated, white-tailed eagle\" of lines 62b-63a."

        "content": "\"The Battle of Brunanburh\" is edited, annotated and linked to digital images of all five of its manuscript witnesses, with modern translation, in the Old English Poetry in Facsimile Project: https://oepoetryfacsimile.org/ The poem is included in the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records. The now-accepted standard edition of the poem is the 1938 edition by Alistair Campbell. The Battle of Brunanburh: A Casebook, edited by Michael Livingston, was published by the University of Exeter Press in 2011; it includes two alternative translations of the poem and essays on the battle and the poem. The twelfth-century Anglo-Norman chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar likely used the account in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for his treatment of \u00c6thelstan in his L'Estoire des Engles. English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson translated (or \"modernized\") the poem in 1880, publishing it as part of his Ballads and Other Poems (and his son Hallam Tennyson published a prose translation of the poem). In contrast to many other translations of poetry, Tennyson's is still praised as \"a faithful, sensitive, even eloquent recreation of its source.\" The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges wrote a short poem, \"Brunanburh 937 AD,\" a translation of which was published in The New Yorker. In a 1968 lecture at Harvard University, Borges praised Tennyson's translation, stating that in some locutions Tennyson sounds \"more Saxon than the original.\" A translation by Burton Raffel is included in Alexandra Hennessey Olsen's anthology Poems and prose from the Old English."

Dolcenera later stated that, while the previous albums were composed starting with a piano, the songs from Evoluzione della specie were composed starting from drums and bass. The album was recorded from July 2010 to November 2010 at the Jungle Sound Studio in Milan. Dolcenera documented the recording process publishing 5 videos on her YouTube official channel. On 30 November 2010 she announced the end of the recording sessions: The result is a sort of summary of different elements and factors. There are a lot of people working on this album, even more than on the previous one. Seven songs from the album were produced by Roberto Vernetti and Dolcenera, while the remaining ones were produced by Dolcenera. Alex Trecarichi recorded and mixed all the songs from the album. Dolcenera also wrote, composed and arranged the songs from her new album. Moreover, she played drums for the first time in her career.

After its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), The Raid received positive reviews from critics. The name of the film was changed to The Raid: Redemption in the United States as distributor Sony Pictures Classics could not secure the rights to the title; it also allowed Evans to plan out future titles in the series. The US release of the film features a film score composed by Mike Shinoda and Joseph Trapanese. It was released in the United States on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on 14 August 2012. A sequel, The Raid 2, was released in 2014. Both films showcase the traditional Indonesian martial art of Pencak Silat, with fight choreography led by Uwais and Yayan Ruhian.

Together with his lieutenants Andi and Mad Dog, Tama runs the block and allows criminals and addicts to rent rooms under his protection. Arriving undetected, the team sweeps the first floors and subdues various tenants; they also meet a law-abiding tenant named Gofar delivering medicine to his sick wife. Continuing to the sixth floor, the team is spotted by two young lookouts, one of whom raises the alarm. Tama calls in reinforcements and the team suffers casualties. Tama cuts the lights and announces over the PA system that the officers are on the sixth-floor stairwell, and that he will grant permanent residence to those who kill them. The remaining team members are ambushed by shooters from above, and are almost completely wiped out. Prior to the gunfight, Wahyu confesses to Jaka that he staged the mission so he can eliminate Tama, who is in league with corrupt police officials, including himself; the mission is not officially sanctioned by police command, and there will be no reinforcements. The remaining officers\u2014Rama, Bowo, Jaka, Wahyu, Dagu and three others\u2014retreat to an empty apartment and are cornered by more armed thugs. Rama uses an axe to create a hole in the floor so the team can descend to the lower level. Dropping to the room below, the team struggles to fend off Tama's thugs; the three other officers are killed and Bowo is gravely wounded. Rama uses a propane tank to construct an improvised explosive device that eliminates the invading henchmen. With more of Tama's reinforcements approaching, the team splits into two groups: Jaka, Dagu and Wahyu retreat to the fifth floor, while Rama and Bowo ascend. After fighting a group of assassins, Rama and Bowo locate Gofar's apartment, and Gofar reluctantly hides the officers inside. A gang wielding machetes search the apartment, but fail to find them. After tending to Bowo's wounds, Rama leaves to search for Jaka's group. Rama encounters the machete gang and defeats them in a long fight, tackling their leader through a window and plummeting onto a fire escape below. On the sixth floor, he finds Andi, who has murdered two of Tama's men. Andi is revealed to be his estranged brother, whom Rama signed up for the mission to search for, at the urging of their father. Rama refuses to leave the building without his comrades, and Andi refuses to abandon his criminal life. Rama parts ways with his brother to search for his surviving colleagues. Mad Dog discovers Jaka and his group on the fourth floor. Wahyu runs off, and Jaka instructs Dagu to protect him. Mad Dog challenges Jaka to hand-to-hand combat; he ultimately gains the upper hand and kills Jaka, by breaking his neck. Mad Dog then meets up with Andi to report back to Tama. Tama, having learned of Andi's treachery through his surveillance cameras, attacks and incapacitates Andi. Rama regroups with Dagu and Wahyu, and they head for Tama on the 15th floor, fighting through a narcotics lab along the way. Rama separates from Dagu and Wahyu when he discovers Mad Dog torturing Andi. Mad Dog lets Rama free Andi, and fights them both. After a long and brutal fight, Mad Dog is ultimately killed by Rama and Andi. Meanwhile, Wahyu and Dagu confront Tama. Wahyu kills Dagu before taking Tama hostage. Tama taunts Wahyu by revealing that he knew they were going to raid the building, and that Wahyu was set up by his corrupt superiors and will be killed regardless. Wahyu kills Tama and then attempts suicide, only to find he is out of ammunition. Andi uses his influence to allow Rama to leave with the injured Bowo and a detained Wahyu. Andi also hands over blackmail recordings Tama made of the corrupt officials he dealt with, telling him to contact Officer Bunawar. Rama asks Andi to come home, but Andi refuses, and asserts that he can protect Rama in his role as a gang boss, but that Rama cannot do the same for him. As Andi turns around and walks back to the apartment block, Rama, Bowo and Wahyu leave."

Joe Taslim as Jaka, the Sergeant who leads his unit into the raid. Having been a fan of Merantau, the former Judo champion Taslim contacted Evans through Facebook for their next project. As Evans was browsing through Taslim's profile, he came across a photo of him in a SWAT uniform and felt that it resonated with the character. Evans had him undergo choreography and drama auditions, with Taslim earning the role having aced them both. as Tama Riyadi, a ruthless drug lord who is the boss of the apartment building. Evans wanted a non-stereotypical take on the character, citing most gangster films wherein the boss is usually wearing a pristine suit and smoking cigars. Yayan Ruhian as Mad Dog, a skilled fighter who is the muscle behind Tama's operation. Ruhian previously worked with Evans in Merantau as an actor and fight choreographer. Evans cast Ruhian in the film as he wanted him to play a \"purely evil\" character, opposite to that which he played in his debut film which had a \"redeemable value\". Donny Alamsyah as Andi, Tama's consigliere who is also Rama's estranged elder brother. Alamsyah also played Uwais' character's brother in Merantau. Since he regretted not being able to do action scenes in Merantau, Alamsyah approached Evans as they prepared for The Raid, earning the role having aced the audition. Iang Darmawan as Gofar, a tenant of the building who tends to his ill wife. Prior to the film, Gofar's acting credits had been in sketch comedies, and The Raid marks his transition to a serious role. Pierre Gruno as Wahyu, the Lieutenant who arranges the eponymous raid to take out Tama. One of the few survivors of the raid. Tegar Satrya as Bowo, the hothead member of the team who is wounded attempting to save the life of a teammate. One of the few survivors of the raid.

It was in that country that he met Iko Uwais, a Silat practitioner who was then working as a delivery man for a phone company based in Jakarta. Evans then nudged his wife to cast Uwais for Merantau, and then in The Raid. Following Merantau, Evans and his producers began work on a Silat film project called Berandal (Indonesian for Thugs), a large-scale prison gangster film intended to star not only Merantau actors Uwais and Yayan Ruhian but also an additional pair of international fight stars. A teaser trailer was shot, but the project proved more complex and time-consuming than anticipated. After a year and a half, Evans and the producers found themselves with insufficient funds to produce Berandal, so they changed the film to a simpler but different story with a smaller budget. They called the project Serbuan Maut (The Raid). Producer Ario Sagantoro considers the film to be lighter than Merantau. Evans also considers it to be \"a lot more streamlined,\" stating that \"Merantau is more of a drama\" while The Raid is more of a \"survival horror film.\" Evans wanted The Raid vastly different from Merantau in terms of pacing. With Merantau, some fans complained the action sequences took too long to appear since the first 45 minutes of the film laid emphasis on character development, backdrop (specifically, the Indonesian culture) and drama. Therefore, Evans designed The Raid to be a \"full-on\" action film. Pre-production took about four months, which include finalization of the script (which included translation of the original English-language script into Indonesian) and the work on choreography for the fighting sequences, which were designed by Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian. The actors that make up the key members of the police squad were sent to bootcamp military training with KOPASKA, where they learned how to use weapons, and how to perform strategic attack and defense techniques."

To achieve that objective, they shot the film in high-definition using Panasonic AF100 camcorderwhich had just recently come out of the market and strayed from using film format while shooting most action and fight sequences. In addition, the camera was frequently attached to a Fig Rig to prevent most scenes from being too jarring, and give the camera operator opportunities to change angles and positions rapidly. All guns used in the film were Airsoft replicas, to avoid the costs associated with having to deal with firearms. All the shots of the guns' actions cycling, muzzle flashes and cases ejecting were added digitally."

Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 5 out of 5, and said \"This violent, intense and brilliant bulletfest from Indonesia puts western action movies to shame.\" Bilge Ebiri of Vulture.com wrote: \"Once the action starts - and it starts very quickly - The Raid is relentless, breathtaking in its sheer propulsive majesty. But it's also shot through with moments of bleak poetry amid the carnage.\" Robert Koehler of Variety praised the director: \"Taking the genre to a higher level of intensity, the Welsh-born Evans continues what he started in previous Indonesia-set actioner \"Merantau,\" but this picture will seal his cult status.\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune wrote: \"The whole film is. \"The Raid\" is maniacal in its pacing and assault tactics. It's also, absurdly, rated R. Fantastic. I love that a film this gory secured the same Motion Picture Association of America rating as \"The King's Speech.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called it \"fists of fury mixed with torture porn\" noting the variety of gory action sequences, but criticized the incoherent narrative. He gave it a B- grade. Roger Ebert of the  Chicago Sun-Times''' gave the film one star out of four; he criticized the lack of character depth, and noted \"the Welsh director, Gareth Evans, knows there's a fanboy audience for his formula, in which special effects amp up the mayhem in senseless carnage.\" Ebert was criticized for his assessment, and later published a defense of his review."

It was later confirmed that Berandal would serve as a sequel to The Raid. Evans has also stated his intention to make a trilogy. Sony pre-bought the US, Latin American and Spanish rights to the sequel. Alliance/Momentum bought the rights to the United Kingdom and Canada; Koch Media acquired the film for German-speaking territories; Korea Screen acquired the rights to Korea; and HGC acquired the rights to China. Deals for other major territories were also in negotiations. Subtitled Berandal for the Indonesian market and simply The Raid 2 for the US and English-speaking market, the sequel had a \"significantly larger\" budget than its predecessor, and its filming included approximately 100 days of shooting. Pre-production began in September 2012 while filming began in January 2013. On the release of The Raid 2 in 2015, Evans said he had ideas for The Raid 3 but that nothing had been written yet and a third film was not likely to happen before 2018 or 2019. In a 21 November 2016 interview with Impact Online, director Evans revealed the sequel was on hold with the franchise likely having ended, stating \"Moving back to UK felt like a closing chapter on that franchise \u2013 we ended the story pretty neatly (I feel) in Part 2. I\u2019m aware there's an interest for it  So never say never, but it's unlikely to happen anytime soon.\" In September 2018 Evans again stated that he felt the story was complete and that a third film was highly unlikely."

Island Records co-president Ted Cockle has emphasised that Lioness is not in any way the planned follow-up to Winehouse's album Back to Black (2006). In fact, only two songs intended for the planned follow-up had been completed prior to her death. The album is a compilation of recordings from before the release of Winehouse's debut studio album, Frank, in 2002, up to music she was working on in 2011. Producers Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson compiled the album with the consent of the Winehouse family. They worked together on listening to thousands of hours of vocals by Winehouse. Remi told NME that the album would not lead to \"a Tupac situation\", referring to Tupac Shakur, in whose name seven posthumous studio albums have been released since his death in 1996. He stated, \"A lot of people, through the other antics that were going on with her personally, didn't get that she was at the top of what she did. Coming to Miami was her escape from all of that, and her writing process could document her life, whether it was recording the pain or the loneliness or the humour. It makes no sense for these songs to be sitting on a hard drive, withering away.\" Two tracks from Lioness: Hidden Treasures received world exclusive plays on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra on 3 November 2011. The Chris Moyles Show aired the first play of \"Our Day Will Come\", while DJ Twin B broadcast the world premiere of \"Like Smoke\", which features Nas.

        "content": "Tulu cinema, also known as Coastalwood, is a part of Indian cinema. The Tulu film industry produces five to seven films annually. The first Tulu film was Enna Thangadi released in 1971. Usually, earlier, these films were released in theatres across the Tulu Nadu region. But currently the Tulu film industry has grown to such an extent that films are being released simultaneously in Mangalore, Udupi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Gulf countries. The critically acclaimed Tulu film Suddha won the award for the best Indian Film at the Osian's Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema held in New Delhi in 2006. In 2011, the Tulu film Industry got a second lease of life with the release of the film Oriyardori Asal. The film turned out to be the biggest hit in Tulu film history to date. Chaali Polilu is the longest running film in Tulu film industry. This movie is the highest grossing film in the Tulu film industry. It has successfully completed 470 days at PVR Cinemas in Mangalore. On 27 February 2016, Times of India carried a special report regarding the Tulu cinema industry where it was observed that in its 45-year history, of the Tulu industry, only 45 movies were released for the first 40 years from 1971 to 2011, whereas in the five years since then, 21 films have been made. It also identified Oriyardori Asal (with 1,000-plus houseful shows and a 175-day run in the Tulu-dominated regions of south Karnataka) as the turning point of the industry. It also reported that eight films were made in 2014 and eleven films were made in 2015 and identified Kudla Cafe as the 66th film from the Tulu film industry. It also reported that another movie that broke records was Chaali Polilu, a 2014 social comedy film by Virendra Shetty Kavoor, which had a run of 470 shows at a popular multiplex in Mangalore, playing to full houses on the weekends and 50% occupancy on weekdays. It also reported that with a modest budget of Rs 40 lakhs () to Rs 60 lakhs (), Tulu films stood out with their touch of reality. For a language native to about two million people, the main audience for Tulu films is limited to two districts \u2013 Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kasargod taluk. They also see a limited release in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Dubai. The 2014 movie Madime was reported to be remade in Marathi, thereby becoming the first Tulu movie to be remade in another language. Shutterdulai is the first remake in Tulu cinema. Eregla Panodchi is the second remake in Tulu cinemas. A suit for damages of Rs. 25 lakhs () was filed against the makers of the Telugu film Brahmotsavam for copying the first 36 seconds of the song  by Dr. Vamana Nandaavara found on the Deepanalike CD composed for the Siri channel. The song was used in the movie in a sequence involving the lead actor who, while accompanying his family on a tour, dances to the tune of the hit Tulu song. Prajavani reported that with its dubbing rights sold to Hindi for 21 lakhs (), the 2018 movie Umil became the first Tulu movie to achieve the feat. Ashwini Kotiyan (Chaya Harsha) became the first female director in the Tulu industry after directing and releasing her first movie Namma Kudla. Brahmashree Narayana Guruswamy released on 2 May 2014 was the 50th Tulu film. Panoda Bodcha marked the 75th release anniversary of a Tulu film.

        "content": "The history of L'Indice begins in October 1984, with the literary critic Cesare Cases\u2019s words about what a book review is expected to achieve: \u00abThe essential is that the first moment, that is the description of a book\u2019s contents, shall have the centrality it deserves. Connivance to the reader should not be established ... on the basis of specialistic interest nor by formal flatteries; contents only can ground it ... The essential is that the reader should get from the description of contents a clear idea of what the book is and of the reasons of its importance, those which have induced us to prefer it to others\u00bb. In its twenty-eight years of existence, L'Indice has always remained faithful to this program. It has documented the Italian book production through reviews and notices, along with surveys, columns, interviews and articles of different sorts. Each of its editors has left his own mark on the review: Gian Giacomo Migone (1984\u201390) and Cesare Cases (1990\u20131994) have contributed to specify the original project, whose recognizable physiognomy is indissolubly associated with Tullio Pericoli's portraits and graphics, as well as with Franco Matticchio's drawings. Alberto Papuzzi (1994\u20131999) brought special attention to the relationship between cinema and literature/essays. Under Luca Rastello's (2000\u20132001) guidance, L'Indice inaugurated a new column, \"Segnali\" (Signals), focusing on cultural and political changes, as well as knotty issues in the society we live in. Mimmo C\u00e0ndito (2001-) has enriched L'Indice with \u201cVillaggio globale\u201d (Global Village), hosting correspondents who write about books production in Europe and worldwide."

        "content": "In 1989, Gian Giacomo Migone, then editor of L'Indice, and Pierre Bourdieu launched the idea of a European literary and cultural journal to be published with identical contents in several European countries. Starting from apparently national, country-specific interventions, the journal aimed at emphasizing the inherent unity of the European culture in a critical historical moment of the integration process, addressing specialists and the wider public at the same time. Along with L'Indice, The Times Literary Supplement, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Le Monde and El Pa\u00eds sponsored the project. A 24-pages quarterly multinational literary journal called \u201cLiber. Revue europ\u00e9enne des livres\u201d (\u201cLiber. European Review of Books\u201d) \u2013 deliberately playing upon the ambiguity intrinsic to the Latin root, which means both \u201cbook\u201d and \u201cfree\u201d \u2013 was therefore published in the biennium 1989-90 (its first issue was presented at the Frankfurt Book Fair of October 1989), with a combined circulation of over one million. The editor was Pierre Bourdieu. Jeremy Treglown (then editor of The Times Literary Supplement), Frank Schirrmarcher (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung) and Thomas Ferenczi (Le Monde) joined Migone and Bourdieu in the editorial board. After five editions, \u201cLiber\u201d became a supplement of Bourdieu\u2019s publication Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales."

        "content": "Nymphomaniac (stylised as NYMPH()MANIAC onscreen and in advertising) is a 2013 European two-part erotic art film written and directed by Lars von Trier. The film stars Charlotte Gainsbourg, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Stacy Martin, Shia LaBeouf, Christian Slater, Jamie Bell, Uma Thurman, Jean-Marc Barr, Willem Dafoe and Connie Nielsen. The plot follows Joe (played by Gainsbourg and Martin), a self-diagnosed nymphomaniac, who recounts her erotic experiences to a bachelor who helps her recover from an assault. The narrative chronicles Joe's promiscuous life from adolescence to adulthood and is split into eight chapters told across two volumes. The film was originally supposed to be only one complete entry, but, because of its length, von Trier made the decision to split the project into two separate films. Nymphomaniac was an international co-production of Denmark, Belgium, France, and Germany. The world premiere of the uncut Volume I occurred on 16 February 2014 at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival, while the uncut Volume II premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival. The world premiere of the Director's Cut took place in Copenhagen on 10 September 2014. It was nominated for the 2014 Nordic Council Film Prize. Nymphomaniac is the third and final installment in von Trier's unofficially titled Depression Trilogy, following Antichrist and Melancholia."

He takes her back to his home and, over tea, listens intently as Joe recounts the story of her libidinous life. Seligman, a highly educated but cloistered man, connects and analyzes Joe's stories with what he has read about.

        "content": "Inspired by a fly fishing lure on the wall behind her and Seligman's love of Izaak Walton's book The Compleat Angler, Joe opens her story by talking about her precocious sexual fascination during her early childhood. Her father (Christian Slater) is a tree-loving doctor whom she adores while her mother (Connie Nielsen) is, as Joe describes her, a \"cold bitch\". In adolescence, Joe (Stacy Martin) loses her virginity to an arbitrary young man named Jer\u00f4me (Shia LaBeouf). This first encounter, which ends with Jer\u00f4me casually leaving her to fix his moped, leaves her disappointed, while Seligman observes that the combination of the number of times Jer\u00f4me penetrated her, three times vaginally and five times anally, resembles the Fibonacci sequence. Several years later, Joe engages in a contest with her friend B (Sophie Kennedy Clark) during a train journey; whichever of the two women has sex with the most passengers by the train's arrival at the station wins a bag of chocolate sweets. After having sex in the toilet with several of the men she comes across, Joe wins by performing a blowjob on a passenger in a first class car, S (Jens Albinus). S is a married man who resists both her and B's advances, but ultimately Joe forces herself on him. Joe tells Seligman her encounter with S is the first of many terrible things she's done, but he waves off her accusation. Over rugelach and a discussion over the lack of masculinity in men using cake forks to eat pastry, Joe talks about her first experiences with actual love, something she dismisses as \"lust with jealousy added.\" Joe takes on more lovers as she, B, and several friends create a club, \"The Little Flock\", dedicated to liberating themselves from society's fixation on love. Joe eventually leaves after all the other members end up developing serious attachments to their conquests. As a young adult, Joe drops out of medical school and finds work as a secretary at a printing company. Her first employer is none other than Jer\u00f4me. While sexual intentions are clearly on his mind, she finds herself avoiding his advances and sleeping with other co-workers, frustrating him. When Joe finally realizes she has developed feelings for Jer\u00f4me, she writes him a letter. However, she is too late as he has left with his uncle's jealous secretary Liz (Felicity Gilbert), who was fully aware of Joe's feelings. She is immediately fired by his uncle (Jesper Christensen), the actual owner of the company, for her lack of experience and goes back to indulging her nymphomania, despite a yearning for Jer\u00f4me. On one occasion with one of her lovers, H (Hugo Speer), Joe inadvertently causes conflict that makes him leave his wife for her. The distressed Mrs. H (Uma Thurman) arrives and demonizes both of them in front of her children, though Joe states in the present that this barely affected her. The situation then becomes more awkward as Joe's next lover, A (Cyron Melville), arrives at the house and finds himself in the middle of Mrs. H's mental breakdown. The family finally leaves, but not before Mrs. H verbally lacerates Joe, slaps her now ex-husband and leaves the apartment wailing. A conversation about Edgar Allan Poe and his death from delirium tremens reminds Joe of the last time she saw her father. She is the only one to visit him in the hospital as he dies of cancer. Joe's father asks her not to slander her mother, who is afraid of hospitals, for not being by his side, explaining they said their goodbyes. Joe is a firsthand witness as her father deteriorates from a unnamed illness, into fits of violent spasms, paranoid delusions and screams for his wife. To take her mind off her father's suffering, the cause of which she remains naive to, Joe has sexual intercourse with several people at the hospital. When he finally dies, Joe becomes sexually aroused, with a drop of vaginal fluid running down her thigh as she stands in front of the body, and becomes numb with depression. After Seligman explains how he feels Bach perfected polyphony, Joe uses his example to talk about three lovers leading up to her \"cantus firmus.\" The \"bass voice\", F (Nicolas Bro) is a tender but predictable man who puts her sexual needs above his own. The \"second voice\", G (Christian Gade Bjerrum), thrills Joe because of his animalistic control of her in bed. During one of Joe's regular walks in the local park, Jer\u00f4me finds her after separating from Liz, a coincidence Seligman finds preposterous, and they embrace. As the two engage in authentically passionate sex \u2013 set alongside Joe's experiences with F and G \u2013 Joe becomes emotionally distraught when discovering she can no longer \"feel anything\"."

        "content": "Joe becomes annoyed with Seligman, accusing him of overlooking the severity of her lost sexuality to focus on the allegorical before realizing he can't relate to her stories. He goes on to confirm his asexuality and virginity, but assures her his lack of bias and \"innocence\" makes him the best man to listen to her story. She becomes inspired to tell him another portion of her life after noticing a Rublev-styled icon of the Virgin Mary and a discussion about the differences between the Eastern Church (\"the church of happiness\") and the Western Church (\"the church of suffering\"). Joe reminisces about a field trip as a young girl that suggests she had a vision of Valeria Messalina and the Whore of Babylon looking over her as she levitates and spontaneously has her first orgasm, which shocks Seligman as he explains her orgasm is a mockery of the Transfiguration of Jesus on the Mount. Returning to where she left off in her story, Joe falls into a crisis upon losing her ability to achieve sexual pleasure, though she does find a different sort of pleasure in her time with Jer\u00f4me. When the two conceive a baby together, Marcel, Jer\u00f4me struggles to keep up with her sexual needs and allows her to see other men. This is shown to be detrimental later, as he becomes jealous of her endeavors. Several years later to no success, Joe's sexual endeavors become increasingly adventurous by engaging in a tryst with a pair of African brothers that turns into a botched threesome; the frustration to reclaim her orgasm culminates in visits to K (Jamie Bell), a sadist who violently assaults women seeking his company. The more she visits him, the more neglectful she becomes in her domestic duties. At Christmas, after stopping an unattended Marcel who has wandered out an opened door onto a snowy balcony from coming into any harm, Jer\u00f4me forces her to choose between the family and K. She picks the latter and, after receiving an especially brutal beating from K with a cat o' nine tails that allows her to climax again, takes a path of loneliness away from her one and only possibility of a normal life. Marcel is sent to live in a foster home because Jer\u00f4me has no room in his life for him. To keep the story from ending on an unhappy note, Joe concludes it with the first time K introduced her to \"the Silent Duck\", which leaves Seligman surprised and impressed at K's talents. Looking at the mirror facing Seligman's bed, Joe jumps ahead in time. Several years later, Joe has regained pleasure, but her genitalia are left with some irreversible damage due to a lifetime of sexual activity mixed with K's brutality. Her habits are known around her new office, prompting the boss to demand she attend sex addiction therapy under the threat of losing her job and any future job she takes. When asked why she refused to attend therapy, Joe talks about becoming pregnant after leaving Jer\u00f4me and Marcel and demanding her doctor abort the 11-week pregnancy, but he insists she speak to a counselor first. The visit to the psychologist (Caroline Goodall) ends disastrously due to Joe's attitude towards the situation. She decides to take matters into her own hands and perform the abortion herself. Using the knowledge she had retained from medical school, Joe aborts the fetus with the use of several household implements and a wire hanger. Back in the present, Joe and Seligman get into a very heated argument regarding Joe's actions, abortion rights in general and Seligman's potential hypocrisy in supporting them while wanting to know nothing about how the actual procedure is performed. Joe reluctantly attends the meetings and, after ridding her apartment of almost everything in it, attempts sobriety. During one meeting three weeks later, she sees a reflection of her younger self in the mirror, harshly insults every member of the group, including the therapist, and proclaims pride in her nymphomania before walking out. Joe tells Seligman she isn't sure where to conclude her story as she's used every item from around his room to help inspire each \"chapter\". After a suggestion from him, she notices how the stain from a cup of tea she had earlier thrown in anger looks like a Walther PPK, the same kind of gun her favorite literary character James Bond uses, and knows exactly how and where to end things. Realizing she has no place in \"normal\" society, Joe turns to organized crime and becomes a debt collector, utilizing her extensive knowledge of men, sex, and sadomasochism. She reminisces about a memorable housecall to a man (Jean-Marc Barr) who she initially finds sexually unreadable. She ties him to a chair, strips him and attempts to provoke him with every sexual scenario she can think of. Upon further interrogation, Joe gleans that he is a repressed pedophile. She takes pity on him and fellates him. Joe explains to Seligman how she feels deep compassion for people born with a forbidden sexuality. She strongly identifies with the man's loneliness and status as a sexual outcast, and applauds him for going through life without acting on his aberrant desires. Joe's superior, L (Willem Dafoe), recommends that she groom an apprentice and suggests P (Mia Goth), the 15-year-old daughter of criminals. Joe is initially repulsed by the idea, but ends up sympathizing with the girl in question. P is a vulnerable, lonely, emotionally damaged young girl who quickly latches herself onto Joe. The two of them click and form a special connection. Joe opens her heart to P and eventually invites her to move into her home. Over time, Joe and P's relationship develops a sexual dimension, leading to romance. As P seems to mature, Joe hesitantly decides to teach her young female lover the ropes of her trade. During one round of debt collection, Joe notices that they are at a house belonging to Jer\u00f4me (now played by Micha\u00ebl Pas) and, to make sure she is not seen, tells P to perform her first solo job. This proves to be a mistake as Joe eventually discovers P is having an affair with Jer\u00f4me. After finding her \"soul tree\" in a failed attempt to leave town, Joe waits for Jer\u00f4me and P in the alley between his home and her apartment and pulls a gun she confiscated from P earlier on him. When she pulls the trigger, she forgets to rack the pistol. Jer\u00f4me viciously beats Joe and then has sex with P right in front of her, thrusting into P in exactly the same way he once took her virginity. P urinates on her before leaving her as she was at the beginning of the film. In the present, Seligman suggests how the circumstances of Joe's life might have been due to differences in gender representation; all of the stigma, guilt and shame she felt for her actions made her fight back aggressively \"like a man\", ultimately \"forgetting\" to rack the gun because her human worth wouldn't allow her to kill someone, even Jer\u00f4me. Joe, who has until this moment been playing devil's advocate to Seligman's assumptions, finally feels at peace, having unburdened her story to someone with she truly considers a friend. She says she is too tired to go on and asks to go to sleep. As Joe begins to drift off, Seligman silently returns with his pants off and attempts to have intercourse with her. Joe wakes up and, realizing what Seligman is doing, reaches for and racks the gun. Seligman protests and attempts to justify his behavior, but Joe shoots him, grabs her things, and flees the apartment."

        "content": "Principal photography occurred between 28 August\u20139 November 2012 in Cologne and Hilden, Germany, and in Ghent, Belgium. To produce scenes of simulated sex, von Trier used digital compositing to superimpose the genitals of pornographic film actors onto the bodies of the film's actors. Producer Louise Vesth explained during the Cannes Film Festival: We shot the actors pretending to have sex and then had the body doubles, who really did have sex, and in post we will digital impose the two. So above the waist it will be the star and the below the waist it will be the doubles. Gainsbourg and Martin further revealed that prosthetic vaginas and closed sets were used during filming. Martin stated that her acting experience for the film was enjoyable and, after explaining that the film's characters are a reflection of the director himself, referred to the process as an \"honour.\" Martin also stated that shooting the sex scenes was a bit boring due to their technical nature. The film makes several references to the other films in the trilogy. For example, the scene showing Marcel approaching an open upper floor window references the similar sequence during the beginning of Antichrist and even uses the same background music from that aforementioned scene. Furthermore, Joe's monologue about loneliness is edited to shots of the universe from Melancholia. As a reference to von Trier's comments at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, during a scene available in the director's cut only, \"Joe says she could understand dictators such as Hitler. Seligman shakes his head in disbelief. After she showed sympathy for racists and pedophiles, it is quite obvious that she also has to sympathize with the biggest mass murderer in history.\" Joe has been referred to as a \"proto-fascist heroine.\""

Shortly thereafter, Zentropa released a promotional photo shoot featuring the film's main characters posing in suggestive positions and a list of the film's chapters. This was followed by the release of a picture of Trier himself with duct tape covering his mouth, accompanied by a press release explaining the official launch of the film's campaign. An incremental marketing campaign was used to promote the film, as brief video segments, each described as an \"appetizer\" by the film's production company, were released online leading up to the film's release date. Each appetizer represented each of the eight chapters of Nymphomaniac and the first one, entitled \"The Compleat Angler\", appeared on 28 June 2013, the last Friday of the month\u2014this pattern would be followed for the monthly release of the subsequent clips. Following \"The Compleat Angler\", \"Jer\u00f4me\" featuring Martin and LaBeouf, was released in August; \"Mrs. H\" in September; the predominantly black-and-white \"Delirium\" (containing a voice-over by Skarsg\u00e5rd) was released in October; in November, the appetizer for \"The Little Organ School\" was uploaded to YouTube, but was quickly removed due to its explicit content; \"The Eastern and the Western Church\" was released exclusively for Vimeo on 29 November; in December, the appetizer for \"The Mirror\" was released, again on Vimeo; and on 25 December, leading into the European release of the film, \"The Gun\" was released on the film's official website. In October 2013, a series of posters were released, each depicting the film's characters during the moment of orgasm. Along with the appetizers and the character posters, five theatrical posters (three for the complete feature and one for each volume) and an international trailer featuring some of the explicit sexual scenes, were released. In July 2014, Zentropa revealed the poster for the Director's Cut when announcing its premiere at the Venice Film Festival. The poster combined the original teaser with Lars von Trier standing in between the two parentheses."

The second volume gained a 60/100 rating based on 34 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". In the UK, Martin Solibakke of Mancunion praised Stacy Martin's performance, saying he had \"never felt so sure about an actress's future success since I saw Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone four years ago\". He ended his review with hailing the film, saying \"Lars von Trier ends up hitting the G-spot of avant-garde filmmaking with a movie only he could ever make, and gives the open-minded members of the audience one of the most powerful and sensational experiences ever seen in arts.\" Michelle Orange of The Village Voice called it a \"jigsaw opus, an extended and generally exquisitely crafted riff.\" In The Australian, David Stratton said that he \"detested\" some of Trier's films, and states that Nymphomaniac \"seems designed to be his magnum opus, the film in which he gets to rail against everything he loathes about contemporary life and contemporary cinema.\" The modified version is screening in Australia, officially referred to as the \"international\" version. Stratton further stated on the television review program At the Movies that he found the four-hour runtime of the film to be \"daunting\", but praised some of the performances, particularly those of Stacy Martin and Jamie Bell. Stratton's co-host Margaret Pomeranz meanwhile, while also praising the boldness of the performances, felt the film's unsimulated depictions of sex didn't add to the narrative and as such had, \"such an undercurrent of sadism that I was, not repelled, but distanced\". ThoughtCatalog remarked on how the plot failed to be consistent or plausible. Keith Uhlich of The A.V. Club named Nymphomaniac the third-best film of 2014. On the Melbourne community radio station, 3RRR, film criticism program \"Plato's Cave\" praised von Trier's work on Nymphomaniac and presenters, Thomas Caldwell and Josh Nelson, defended the director against accusations of misogyny. Both presenters agreed that actresses who von Trier has worked with, such as Nicole Kidman and Bj\u00f6rk, have delivered excellent performances in his films, while Nelson referred to Antichrist and Melancholia, the first two installments of the Depression Trilogy, as \"masterpieces\". Caldwell concludes the review by stating, \"... if you're coming new to him [Von Trier], I think this is a real crash course in all his preoccupations.\" When the complete Director's Cut had its general release world premiere in Copenhagen on 10 September 2014, major Danish critics gave it high ratings. In spite of this, the Director's Cut sold only 3,494 tickets in Danish cinemas."

Guest stars on the album include Idris Sardi, wh played violin on Guru Oemar Bakrie, while Jazz violinist Luluk Purwanto plays throughout the album, a role that she reprised on the album's follow-up, 'Opini'. The album contains many of Iwan Fals most popular songs, and contains mostly wistful ballads, but also the lively country and western-style Guru Oemar Bakri and blackly comic 'Ambulance Zig Zag'. Iwan Fals' early influence from Bob Dylan is evident in the richly descriptive documentary lyrics, and also in the heavy use of harmonica. The album also features country-style banjo and violin."

In an interview with Les Inrocks, Orelsan says that he didn't know what to talk about anymore. He explains, \"In my first album, I talked about the previous ten years of my life, and at the time I almost never lived at all: I did a tour, sparked a controversy and banged three groupies (laughs).\" On his first album, Perdu d'avance, Orelsan wrote fourteen songs without touching up anything, and threw about thirty songs away before finding \"this mix of rapping and singing, this mix of myself and someone I'm not.\" He also says that he introduced more fiction, something that he wouldn't do before. He continues, \"I confined myself at home, I went on vacations alone. I was at times very depressed.\" In another interview, Orelsan explains that the album's title song \"Le chant des sir\u00e8nes\" was \"a breaking point\". According to the rapper, the song \"La petite marchande de porte-clefs\" is one that \"dragged on for a long time\". In finding a subject matter for the song, he explains that he came across a report on the post-Olympic Games in Beijing and what happened to people who were exploited there, and also saw something on the kidnappings of children in China. He says that he imagined \"the destiny of a girl my age who would've lived all that.\" For the track \"1990\", which was initially called \"Dans les ann\u00e9es 1990\" (\"In the 1990s\"), Orelsan wanted to \"try and write a track today with references of the time.\" He says that \"in these recent times, there's a tendency of returning to the rap of those years.\" Orelsan describes the song \"Suicide social\", which was released as the album's fourth single on September 15, 2011 before the album's release, as \"really a series of clich\u00e9s\", adding that he would have been able to make the song last 4 minutes more. In an interview, he says that talking about people \"as groups, as social classes, as layers, is bullshit,\" and that the song is to be taken as an example of what not to do."

This melody is also used in the song \"H\u00f6gtid beredes och Ganymedes\". In Germany the melody was published in 1877 in a songbook for high schools with the words \u201dHoch soll er leben\u201d.

The first time the song appears with the lyrics \"Ja m\u00e5 han leva\" is in a student songbook in 1914, then used as a drinking song and the first confirmation of the use of the song as a birthday song is as late as of around 1940. Consequently, the song was mainly used as a drinking song during the 19th century but from around 1940 mainly as a birthday song."

        "content": "RUTUBE was launched by Oleg Volobuyev and Mikhail Paulkin \u2014 entrepreneurs from Oryol City and co-owners of a popular multiplayer browser online game based on Dozory, a franchise of novels and short stories by Sergey Lukiyanenko. In an interview with the Business Journal and the iTV channel, the founders said that they had been working on the video service since 2004\u20132005. Mr. Volobuyev said that the I-vision.ru service, which they had developed, was an ActiveX-based browser plugin supporting p2p video chats and streams and could capture videos from devices connected to a PC and process those on the client side. He said that ActiveX control elements created a risk of malware infiltration, so the team had to switch to Flash Video. By the time, YouTube, a US video hosting service, had gained popularity, and the Russian developers characterized their service as Russian YouTube. RUTUBE received the status of a video hosting service in 2006. In 2007, the founders employed Askar Tuganbayev as the producer of RUTUBE; previously, he had managed ATB Internet projects and worked as a producer at O2TV and Gameland TV. While staying in Moscow, Tuganbayev built relationships with partners and looked for an investor for the company. RUTUBE attracted some private investors, Mangrove Capital Partners Venture Fund and Gazprom Media Group, which was entering the Internet market. Negotiation with Gazprom-Media started in summer of 2007, and legal arrangements lasted from March 2008 through November 2008. Speculations on the deal size stirred up public interest. The Kommersant claimed that the 100% capital of the company ranged from $5 mln to $15 mln; in an interview with the Vedomosti, Dmitry Grishin, German Klimenko, and Viktor Lavrenko would suggest $5 mln to $10 mln, $3 mln to $5 mln, and $1 mln respectively. In summer 2008, the Kommersant stated that the RUTUBE control stake had been acquired at $15 mln in total, and the founders had received motivation payments. The company was part of Gazprom Media in 2008 through 2012 At the stage of arrangements, Tuganbayev had to leave the company due to the expiry of his annual contract. The end of the deal was marked with a major staff reshuffle. Developers and systemic administrators were moved to a separate company, and the holding passed technical development and video hosting support over to it. RUTUBE hired media managers, set up a commercial service, designers, and editors, whose responsibility was choosing topics for materials. Former head of the department of management of TNT-owned channels\u2014Mikhail Ilyochov\u2014took up the position of Chief Executive Officer. Vladimir Barabanov, former corporate director of the Hurst Shkulyov Media Publishing House, was appointed as Chief Development Officer. The changes fitted with RUTUBE's new development strategy of a socially-oriented platform. In October 2010, the RUTUBE player was integrated into VKontakte. In April next year, a section was added to Odnoklassniki with the video platform's content, and ad campaigns were launched in September. Also, in September 2011, paid video content was added\u2014live Russian Football League streams maintained in cooperation with NTV-Plus, a satellite TV provider. In October, the user stream service, which had worked since the launch of the platform, stopped working. In March 2011, under the supervision of the RUTUBE managerial staff, the Now.ru online movie theater was launched in the service's technical base, whose library included licensed content provided by Sony Pictures, The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros., Playboy, Lionsgate, BBC, MTV and Nickelodeon. In spring 2011, a dedication ceremony on the platform's servers was held by a Russian Orthodox priest, Father Victor, upon the request of Yury Degtyaryov, General Producer of RUTUBE, captured the attention of mass media. It was reported that the service was going to get blessings from the Council of Muftis and the Chief Rabbi of Russia."

        "content": "In summer 2012, Gazprom Media changed the service's management. At the same time, changes were made to the design, development strategy, and marketing strategy. In the new version, RUTUBE formed a personified home page based on the social graph of a Facebook (and later VKontakte) profile while offering videos posted on RUTUBE and social media and published on other platforms\u2014YouTube and Vimeo. Maxim Ilyichov was replaced by Now.ru Technical Manager Elena Sakharova, who had managed development of Gazprom Media IT broadcast platforms. The service's content management policy shifted from user materials toward editor-managed professional content. In August, RUTUBE demonstrated French movies, short movies, and advertisement videos, which had received Cannes Lions awards. In 2014, the company planned to change its stockholder structure as part of a deal between Rostelekom and Gazprom Media. It was expected that RUTUBE would merge with Zoomby.ru, a platform specializing in TV content and movie-oriented Now.ru, under a single brand. The deal was approved by the Federal Antimonopoly Service, but it was canceled after the Gazprom Media reshuffle. In February 2015, RUTUBE partnered with Sputnik.Deti, a search engine for children, when it presented videos from the secure children's section in search results. In June, the content appeared in a separate section of V Metro, as part of RUTUBE's cooperation with the MaximaTelecom Wi-Fi network of the Moscow Metro. In July, former CEO of Groupon in Russia and Ukraine\u2014Vadim Fedotov\u2014became CEO of RUTUBE and took control of Gazprom Media assets. In October, RUTUBE content appeared on the updated Kinopoisk service."

The system relied on free access to the content at the cost of having to watch ads carefully and to the end. All videos hosted by the service would be available after a free sign-up via phone number. The service would host Movies and Series rather than UGC. All projects by Premier, TNT, Pyatnitsa!, and other major Russian TV channels were available for free.

On December 28, 2020, the information proved true: Gazprom Media became one and only owner of OOO Ruform (a company, which includes RUTUBE and Pladform) and was planning to carry on with the team. Deal size made public. In late December 2020, RUTUBE canceled mandatory sign-up for those planning to confine their activities to watching videos. Users wanting to comment or post their own videos would need to sign up via email, not via phone number. Also, RUTUBE switched back to the classic monetization model relying on free video demonstration with mandatory ad viewing. The polling system was canceled. In April, RUTUBE relaunched. The changes influenced the web version: now there are a completely new interface, intuitive navigation, new color palette, and new content management tools. New sections have been added: \"Podcasts,\" \"Tuition,\" and \"Goods.\" Also, new monetization tools appeared: donates, subscriptions, and live online sales. RUTUBE is increasingly attractive for those who wish to watch videos and share their creative works. In August 2021, Alexey Nazarov, former ER-Telecom top-manager, replaced Roman Maximov as the new CEO of Rutube. The main tasks of Mr. Nazarov are further upgrade, users and traffic increase,  as well as strategic and operations management."

His most famous novel, it chronicles inter-generational conflict between old ways and progressive aspirations in an upper-class family in the city of Chengdu, a prosperous but provincial city in the fertile Sichuan basin in the early 1920s following the New Culture Movement.  The novel was wildly popular among China's youth and established the author as a leading voice of his generation. The novel was first serialized in 1931-2 and then released in a single volume in 1933.  The original title was Turbulent Stream (\u6fc0\u6d41 J\u012bli\u00fa), but changed after Ba Jin released it as a single volume."

        "content": "Gao Juexin () - The eldest brother, who was forced into quitting his university studies and into marrying a woman other than the one he loved. Juexin obeys the Gao family, despite the disapproval from his two brothers. Even though Juexin is in love with Mei, his cousin, he marries Li Ruijue on the orders of Master Gao after he graduates from middle school. After Juemin escapes from the Gao household, Master Gao asks Juexin to find Juemin. Juexin asks Juehui to help him, but the youngest brother accuses Juexin of being a coward. After learning about Mei's death, Juexin is saddened. Han said that \"[t]he miserable experience\" awakens Juexin, who begins opposing Master Gao. Mei Han, author of the entry on \"Family\" in The Facts on File Companion to the World Novel: 1900 to the Present, said that Juexin \"is a victim of conservatism\" who is asked to stop observing idealism, loses the women who are dear to him, and \"does nothing but cries in the corner.\" Jin Feng, author of The New Woman in Early Twentieth-Century Chinese Fiction, said that Juexin is \"a character used by a foil to impress upon the reader Juehui's revolutionary courage as compared to people of his own generation and gender.\" Feng added that while Juehui believes that Juexin is a '\"coward who makes \"unnecessary sacrifices\" of himself and the women he loves', Juehui \"cannot help but sympathize with Juexin dilemma, and in fact often depends on him as a buffer against abuses by their grandfather and uncles.\" Han says that Juexin is also an \"accomplice\" since he helps Master Gao try to find Juemin, and that Juexin \"insists on nonresistance\" despite the fact that he agrees with his brothers. Han argued that Juexin's obedience to the family angers Juehui despite the mercy that Juehui feels for Juexin, \"reflecting the author's own attitude toward\" Juexin. Gao Juemin () - The middle brother. Juemin wears glasses. Juemin is in love with Qin, his cousin. Juemin anticipates the time when his academy begins admitting female students so that the two can get together and marry. Master Gao asks Juemin to marry the Grandniece of Milord Feng, but Juemin instead leaves the house, with Juehui helping him escape. Master Gao later ends the engagement and gives permission for Juemin and Qin to marry. Gao Juehui () - The most rebellious of the brothers. Juehui has an interest in the ideals of the May Fourth Movement. Juehui has a romantic interest in Ming Feng. Han says that Juehui \"pays more attention to the rebellion\" than to Ming Feng. After Ming Feng's death he feels remorse. At the end of the novel, he believes staying in the family is too suffocating, so he leaves Chengdu to go to Shanghai. According to Feng, Juehui is \"the center of consciousness\" in Family. Feng said that while Juehui \"is apparently the most fearless and rebellious of the three brothers\" he also \"is by no means the heroic role model that he has read about in new books and journals\u2014the sources of all his new ideas.\" Feng argues that \"Juehui betrays the most pronounced contradictions through his interactions with his family\" and that Juehui \"often finds himself helplessly entangled in ambivalent feelings\" while dealing with his family, using his interactions with Juexin as an example. Han argued that while being \"high-spirited youth rebelling against his family's restrictions\", Juehui \"still possesses ideas\" from the Gao Family traditions. As an example she cites his pattern of affection for Ming Feng. Han argues that despite the fact that he likes her, \"he never expresses his love or his hidden dreams: If only Ming Feng were a lady like Qin, he would marry her in a heartbeat.\" Li Ruijue () - Juexin's wife. She marries him and falls in love with him, but realizes that Juexin still loves Mei more than her. She dies in childbirth. Han said that Ruijue \"is beautiful and mild, and their intensive love produces their first boy, Hai Chen.\" After Master Gao dies, as Ruijue is pregnant with a second child, relatives cajole Juexin into moving Ruijue out of the city to avoid giving the coffin of Master Gao. Despite Juehui's pleas to have it reversed, Juexin allows the move to happen, and Ruijue dies of childbirth as Juexin is prevented from entering the delivery room during the period of mourning for Master Gao. Mei () - Juexin's cousin and the love of his life. She falls ill and dies. Han said that Mei \"lives a miserable life.\" Within a year from the start of the novel she marries and becomes a widow. Because her mother-in-law had not treated her well, she lives with her mother. Han said that the Gao family's younger members, especially Juexin, \"are sympathetic\" to Mei. Ming Feng () - A maidservant who is forced to marry an older man. She commits suicide. Han describes Ming Feng as \"another tragic woman\" in the Gao family. Ming Feng wants to marry Juehui but Master Gao arranges to have her be a mistress to Milord Feng, a man who is at the same age level as Ming Feng's grandfather would be. Ming Feng begs other members to remove her from the situation but nobody can challenge Master Gao. At midnight before she is to be given to Feng, she appears in Juehui's bedroom but he is so busy working on academic articles that he does not notice Ming Feng and her pleas. She commits suicide by drowning herself in a pool of water. Han says \"Jue Min [sic] and others pity the girl, while Jue Hui [sic] now regrets his carelessness. However none of the people could have changed Ming Feng's fate.\" Qin (): A female cousin of Gao Juexin, and a student. Feng said that Qin \"is ensconced, somewhat ironically, in extensive and complex familial relationships\" so that the book rarely mentions her life away from the Gao family. Feng explained that because Ba Jin made the female student Qin as a more \"feminine\" and \"inferior\" counterpart to the male student Juehui, the \"domestication\" of Qin is \"necessary\". Feng argued that \"at first glance\" Qin and Juehui \"seem to me more similar than different\", and their parallel and symmetrical placement within the storyline of Family \"serves both to segregate the domains of their activities by gender and to differentiate the degree of their radicalism.\" For instance Feng notes that Qin does not come into conflict with male characters in her immediate or extended family and \"acts as a dutiful and loving daughter to her widowed mother\" while Juehui \"usually displays an antagonistic attitude\" towards older men in the Gao family and Juehui leaves the Gao family home. Feng concluded that the fact that Juehui leaves his house means that \"his conflicts with the traditional family system are more fundamental and irreconcilable than those in Qin's case.\" Feng argued that the author \"deployed Qin to magnify Juehui's revolutionary zeal\" by emphasizing differences that the two characters have in their emotional responses and respective relationships to the members of the Gao family and also \"located the source of Qin's weakness in her gender and thus reaffirmed Juehui's superiority.\" Master Gao - The head of the Gao family. As Master Gao grows older, he attempts to reunite the Gao family. Han argues that Master Gao is \"complex\". She explained that Master Gao in fact loves his family and takes steps to enlarge it to accomplish his goal of having a large family, and that he does not believe that his decisions, which are based on ancestral rules, would harm his children. Han concluded that \"Withdrawing his order on his deathbed shows that he remained a kind grandfather at the end, even if he was an ironhanded patriarch.\""

Together with Spring and Autumn, two novels Ba Jin wrote in the period 1939-40, it forms the trilogy, Turbulent Stream Trilogy (\u6fc0\u6d41\u4e09\u90e8\u66f2). An English translation by Sidney Shapiro was published in 1958 by Foreign Languages Press (Beijing), with a third edition in 1978. Shapiro's translation was based on the 1953 People's Publishing House text, in which the author made corrections. Ba Jin made further changes for Shapiro's translation. The 1972 Anchor Books (New York) edition was edited  by Olga Lang, Ba Jin's biographer. The New York edition omits the article \"the\" from the title, which makes \"family\" a more general concept rather than limiting it to this particular family. In her Editor's Note, Lang discusses the history of the text, pointing out that certain passages, the anarchist elements, had been deleted from the 1958 Foreign Languages Press edition. The Anchor edition restored three prefaces by the author, newly translated, as well as some of the omitted passages. A play and two films were based on the novel. The play was adapted by famous playwright Cao Yu in 1941.   A Mainland Chinese TV adaptation, starring Huang Lei, Lu Yi and Huang Yi, was produced in 2007. Ba Jin mentions Wu Yu (a.k.a. Wu Youling), when Juemin and Juexin discuss in a favorable manner how he is going to teach at their school. In the Sidney Shapiro translation Wu Yu is not mentioned by name; instead he is referred to as \"the man who wrote that article, 'Cannibal Confucian Morality' in the New Youth magazine\""

        "content": "Family mentions many of the books and authors which inflamed the young protagonists, giving a vivid picture of intellectual life in a provincial capital. The tone and theme was influenced by works that also influenced many Chinese authors of Ba Jin's generation, for instance A Doll's House by Henrik Ibsen, about the fate of a woman trapped in the physical and social structures of her marriage. Family is often compared to the 18th-century novel, Dream of the Red Chamber, a richly poetic and tragic chronicle of the life of a prominent family living within a great house. Though he did not mention it as a model, Ba Jin, like all educated Chinese of his time, had been familiar with the work from his youth. Where the earlier work is fatalistic and told with philosophical allegory, however, the young heroes of Family leaves home to pursue lives of worldly engagement."

After the show they were approached by Imran Lodhi, Khawer Amir Khan and Yasir Qureshi in February 2006. This was followed by the group having a get-together at Omar Akhtar's home and performing several jam sessions with one another. The jam sessions were not successful for the group. This led the band to perform a few proper jam sessions with each other, these jam sessions saw Omar Khalid on the drums, Yasir Qureshi on darbuka, Imran Lodhi on bass, Khawer and Omar Akhtar on guitars and vocals, thus performing as a proper band. The name of the band was suggested by Omar Akhtar after a discussion with Khawer Khan. In response to Khawer's suggestions, Omar said, \"man that\u2019s just dumb, we might as well call ourselves something stupider, like \u2026I dunno \"Aunty Disco Project\". On March 10, the band performed their first ever gig at TCG Ilmathon under the name \"Eastern Comfort\". The gig was attended by five people in total. On March 23, the band took part in Institute of Business Administration annual Battle of the Bands competition which they eventually went on to winning after beating twenty two other participating bands from Karachi, Sindh. The success of their performance led the band to perform several concerts and gigs at many local colleges and restaurants. Aunty Disco Project's energetic live acts and their performance of original songs, with a unique indie rock blending with eastern percussion, started to create a cult following for the band. This success made them one of the top underground bands in the local music industry. Soon after this success, lead guitarist Khawer Khan departed from the band, leaving quartet to continue as a band. On July 15, the band attempts to get on television by auditioning for the show MTV Battle of the Bands by MTV Pakistan. Although the band were not selected at the competition by the judges, Strings, the show was never aired on television. In August, the band decided to go to recording a full-length studio album. The following month, Aunty Disco Project started working on their debut self-titled album Aunty Disco Project at the New Shadab Studios in Karachi. The album was solely written and produced by the band themselves and included some of their well known songs such as \"Sultanat\", \"Iss Tanhai Ko\" and \"Nazar\". In the summer if 2007, the band continued to grow more mature and professional as live performers as the band received wide acclaim and exposure by performing alongside mainstream singers and groups such as Sajid & Zeeshan, Mizraab, Mauj and Zeb and Haniya. One of the breakthrough and successful live performances included the K-Fest Royal Rodale Show hosted by the local music channel, The Musik, in Karachi. The concert featured many well known musicians and acts like Mauj and Mizraab alongside Aunty Disco Project. On August 14, Aunty Disco Project headlined the first Shanaakht Festival along with pop duo Zeb and Haniya. The concert was held on the independence day of Pakistan where the band opened up the show. This was followed by the band releasing their first music video \"Sultanat\" in same month. The video, directed by the band's lead vocalist Omar Bilal Akhtar, brought the band their first taste of mainstream success as \"Sultanat\" received a large amount of airtime, on both radio and television, and afterwards followed by releasing their second single and video \"Iss Tanhai Ko\" shortly after."

While not commercially successful, the band was lauded for its unique approach to music distribution and they received heavy promotion in the press and on the Internet. In February 2008, Imran Lodhi departed from the band to pursue further studies abroad. Lodhi was then replaced by former Ganda Banda and 3-D Cats lead vocalist Ali Alam who joined the group to take the bass as a sessionist for live performances. However, Aunty Disco Project members continued as group and performed some prolific live performances which included the shows at Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture and another performance at World Music Day, both held in the month of June in Karachi, Sindh. Soon after, the band went on hiatus. In August, Aunty Disco Project started to work on the music video of their single \"Nazar\", being directed by Umer Adil. The band made a comeback into the mainstream airwaves with the release of their third music video and single, the ballad \"Nazar\", after a hiatus of 2 months. The video, directed by Umer Adil was the bands' first high budget video and it got them widespread mainstream attention. The video was critically lauded and for the first time Aunty Disco Project made it on the local music channel charts.

In April, the band signed with Two Five Right Artist Management and welcomed the addition of sessionist Ali Alam as a full-time member of the group on guitars and vocals.

Ayik Soegeng, who had previously designed the cover for Guruh Gipsy\u00a0\u2013 a collaboration between Guruh Sukarnoputra and Sabda Nada, a band featuring Chrisye\u00a0\u2013 in 1976, was selected to design the cover for Pantulan Cita. The photographers Firman Ichsan and Tara Sastrowardoyo initially intended to have a portrait of Chrisye holding a headshot of himself over his face. However, the photographer later decided that portraying  Chrisye's face on a puzzle would be more effective. Soegeng was asked to create the puzzle, taking the photograph initially meant to be held by Chrisye, gluing it to plywood, then cutting out the puzzle with a jigsaw. Chrisye was pleased with the result."

Along with Percik Pesona (Stain of Enchantment; 1979), it was Chrisye's only solo album to not receive any awards. Disappointed with the album's failure, Chrisye decided to go on a sabbatical. He would not record another album until Resesi (Recession), a collaboration with Jockie and Eros Djarot, in 1983. The later album was more successful, but followed then-popular trends in music. Pantulan Cita has been reissued twice, once as a CD in 2004 and once as part of the Chrisye Masterpiece Trilogy Limited Edition in 2007."

Nevertheless, despite heavy features on crimes, local affairs, and entertainment like other major national newspapers (such as Thai Rath and Daily News), the newspaper also remains keen on political and social issues similar to its sister newspapers Matichon and Prachachat. Khaosod is managed by Kanchai Boonparn, who also oversees the Matichon Group as a whole. Khaosod is currently the third-bestselling newspaper in Thailand. Additionally, the online edition of the newspaper experienced a 98 percent rise in number of visits in 2010. Khaosod first came to prominence in 1994 for its extensive coverage of the cover up murders of a Thai gem dealer's wife and her son. Details later emerged, partially due to Khaosods reporting, that Lieutenant-General Chalor Kerdthes of the Royal Thai Police ordered the pair abducted and subsequently murdered after failing to extract information concerning the fate of the Saudi Blue Diamond from the pair. Initially reported by many newspapers as a roadside accident, Khaosod insisted otherwise from early on. Lieutenant-General Chalor and several other police officers were arrested, found guilty, and sentenced to death (the sentence was later reduced to 50 years of imprisonment). Khaosod was awarded Best News Feature from the Isra Amanantakul Foundation in that year for its coverage of the incident."

It marked Harris's first album where he does not regularly provide vocals on each song, instead producing the music and having guest singers sing for him, as Harris stated in late 2010 he did not intend to sing on his songs anymore. The album also shows a shift from Harris' usual nu disco-style songs, focusing more on an electro house style. 18 Months debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, earning Harris his second consecutive number-one album on the chart. It had sold over 923,000 copies in the United Kingdom as of July 2017. The album includes the singles \"Bounce\", \"Feel So Close\", \"Let's Go\", \"We'll Be Coming Back\", \"Sweet Nothing\", \"Drinking from the Bottle\", \"I Need Your Love\" and \"Thinking About You\", all of which, along with \"We Found Love\" featuring Rihanna, reached the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart, making 18 Months the first album in history to spawn nine top-10 singles. The songs \"Let's Go\" and \"Sweet Nothing\" were nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 55th and 56th Grammy Awards, respectively."

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 57, based on 17 reviews. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music hailed the album as a \"collection almost exclusively in the key of triumph\", as well as \"a portfolio of win for Calvin, an annual report where the graph is almost all peaks and the troughs are so far down they're practically invisible.\" Arwa Haider of Metro commented that \"18 Months could be a capsule collection of smash singles, yet it also works brilliantly as an album. That's partly because these are never faceless anthems; its singers [...] are well judged and rise to the songs, while the catchy hooks are lovingly arranged\". AllMusic's Tim Sendra wrote that the album \"shows Harris to be a solid producer with an easily identifiable sound.\" Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times noted that despite the variety of male collaborators, the album \"only deepens the impression that Harris is best when linked with a lady; his skills in that area are several times more developed than they are anywhere else.\" The Independents Andy Gill was unimpressed by Ellie Goulding's performance on \"I Need Your Love\", but complimented Welch on \"Sweet Nothing\", and cited Harris's collaboration with Nicky Romero on \"Iron\" as the album's \"killer cut\". Emily Mackay of NME opined that \"[t]he best collaborations stand alone, but the rest demands small hours and sweat to animate it\", stating the album \"feels more like a deserved victory lap than a forward step or a new instalment, but apart from his sole vocal on 'Feel So Close', the victor seems oddly absent.\" Killian Fox of The Observer remarked, \"Nothing else on 18 Months matches up to the blockbusting collaborations with Kelis, Florence Welch and Rihanna\", concluding that \"Harris's production has become increasingly homogenised and, despite the array of vocalists, everything here risks sounding the same.\" At Entertainment Weekly, Melissa Maerz complimented songs like \"We Found Love\" and \"I Need Your Love\", but found that the album does not offer \"many surprises\". Despite referring to Harris as a \"brilliant pop craftsman\", The A.V. Clubs Chris DeVille felt that the album \"suffers from EDM fatigue\" and that \"almost every track eventually congeals into the same automaton thud.\" Evan Sawdey of PopMatters critiqued that \"while 18 Months [...] is pretty much the hit-making monster that launched [Harris] in to the world spotlight, the truth of the matter is that it feels like a rather compromised vision of who he is an artist, sacrificing his quirkiness for a brooding new persona that starts to get stale over the course of a complete full-length.\" The Guardian critic Rebecca Nicholson expressed that \"Harris knows how to make the most of his guests, leading them through a series of euphoric bangers that seem destined for success. But for all the pop divas he has roped in, there's a veneer of cynical, laddy EDM, resulting in the kind of tracks Skrillex might come up with on an Ayia Napa booze cruise.\""

They used to be best friends, but during their service in Sevastopol in the 1980s, they met a beautiful girl Nelly (Chulpan Khamatova) and fell in love with her at first sight. Nelly chose Ivan, and their friendship fractured. In the early 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and partition of the Soviet Navy, the crew of Slavyanka refused to swear allegiance to Ukraine and were transferred to the Northern Fleet. After that, life and service took their quiet routine course. During an ordinary sortie Captain Gennady Yanychar (Andrey Krasko) sets a task to conduct a torpedo attack against a maneuver enemy and take evasive action keeping undetected for 24 hours. Among the crew is civilian medical specialist Chernenko (Sergey Makovetsky). No-one in the training center knows where the submarine would move. Unknown to the crew, an old World War II naval mine was disturbed. It slowly moved towards the submarine and explodes, sinking it. Only one compartment remains unflooded. Several crew members die in the result of the explosion, including the submarine's commander, Captain Yanychar. The submariners decide to get out though the torpedo tube, but it turns out that only one breathing apparatus is charged and can be used; the rest are empty. The crew decides that Chernenko has to be the one saved first. They instruct him how to act during resurfacing. Chernenko successfully reaches the surface and gets to ground. It remains unknown whether the crew was saved."

Alexander Belov (Lyubshin) is a Russian spy, who travels from Soviet-held Latvia to Nazi Germany under an alias of  Volksdeutsche Johann Weiss. His mastery of the German language, steel nerves and an ability to manipulate others help him to use his connections in the SS to ascend the ladder of the Abwehr and then in the SD. He uses his position to identify sympathetic Germans, who help him to procure vital intelligence, and to help local resistance movements in their collective fight against Nazism."

In Lebanon, the last name Acar means \"trouble\" and originates as a nickname given to a troublemaker. Properly, the name means to roil water; and figuratively, it means to disturb or afflict, and to stir trouble. The name rose to prominence among Maronite families in the Qartaba, Deir el Qamar, and Zahl\u00e9 areas during the Lebanese Peasants Revolt led by Tanyus Shahin. Although a recent family name in Lebanon, the history of Acar goes back Before Christ and is even mentioned in the Bible's Old Testament, Anglicized as Achar or Achan (biblical figure). In the Bible, this is the name of an Israelite who stole forbidden items during the assault on Jericho, for which he and his family were stoned to death (Book of Genesis 36:27, and in Books of Chronicles 1:42 he is called Jaakan). Acar may be the origin of the Greek word 'achos' (\"woe\" or \"pain\"). Therefore, the Greek name Achaeus, and the name of the Ancient Greek mythological hero Achilles finds its origin in the Aramaic Acar."

        "content": "Free Birds is a 2013 American computer-animated science fiction comedy film about two turkeys traveling back in time to prevent their kind ending up on the menu for Thanksgiving. It was produced by Reel FX Creative Studios as its first theatrical fully animated feature film, and Relativity Media (the company's fourth animated film after Monster House (2006) The Tale of Despereaux (2008) and 9 (2009)). Jimmy Hayward directed the film, which he also co-wrote with Scott Mosier, the film's producer. The film stars the voices of Owen Wilson, Woody Harrelson, and Amy Poehler with supporting roles done by George Takei, Colm Meaney, Keith David, and Dan Fogler. Originally titled Turkeys, and scheduled for 2014, the film was released on November 1, 2013, by Relativity Media (the only animated film the company self-distributed). Despite receiving negative reviews, the film was a box office success, grossing $110 million on a $55 million budget."

        "content": "Reggie is a turkey who has always feared Thanksgiving because turkeys have always been on the menu, but his incessant attempts to warn his flock have made him an outcast. When the other turkeys finally realize what is happening, they thoughtlessly throw Reggie outside in an attempt to save themselves. To his surprise, he is named the \"pardoned turkey\" by the President of the United States and is subsequently taken to Camp David. Although initially hesitant, Reggie soon eases into a routine of doing nothing but enjoying pizza from the \"Pizza Dude\" and watching Mexican telenovelas. Reggie is kidnapped by Jake, a member of the Turkey Freedom Front, who tells him that \"The Great Turkey\" told him to find Reggie and take him back to the first Thanksgiving with him to take turkeys off the menu. They steal a time machine controlled by an A.I. named S.T.E.V.E. (Space Time Exploration Vehicle Envoy) from a Government facility. Jake instructs S.T.E.V.E. to time-travel back to the same day in 1621, three days before the first Thanksgiving. Once there, they are ambushed by colonial hunters led by Myles Standish, but they are quickly rescued by native turkeys led by Chief Broadbeak and his two children, Ranger and Jenny. Broadbeak explains that the turkeys in the area have been forced underground since the settlers came and that they cannot risk fighting back without the settlers taking them. The next day, Broadbeak orders Jake and Ranger to spy on the settlers while Reggie and Jenny spring all the humans' hunting traps. Despite initial hostility, Ranger and Jake find out that the settlers have already begun preparations for Thanksgiving and where they keep their weapons. Meanwhile, Jenny is unconvinced Reggie is from the future, but is impressed with his accidental unorthodox way of springing the traps. However, they are soon intercepted by Standish and Reggie is forced to send her into orbit aboard the time machine, validating everything he said. Reggie asks Jenny to go back to the future with him once everything blows over, but she refuses to leave the flock no matter how much she likes him. Jake then drags Reggie away and tells him he has a plan to attack the settlers. However, Reggie has become tired of Jake's improbable stories and threatens to leave. Desperate, Jake tells Reggie that this trip was more about him making up for his failure to save turkey eggs while escaping a factory farm when he was young, maintaining that the Great Turkey convinced him to go through with this. While still reluctant to believe what he said, Reggie still goes along with the plan. They blow up the weapons shack, but Jake inadvertently leaves a gunpowder trail back to the turkeys' hideout. Standish and his men flush the turkeys out from underground, capturing enough for the feast; Broadbeak sacrifices his life to help the remaining turkeys escape. Disgraced, Reggie returns home, where he discovers from S.T.E.V.E. that he is the Great Turkey. He travels back in time to send the young Jake on his mission. Jenny is sworn in as the new chief and orders the remaining turkeys to prepare an attack on the settlers. Jenny, Jake and Ranger lead the turkeys in an attack on the settlement just as Chief Massasoit and his tribe arrive. Inspired, Reggie goes back in time to stop the attack, inadvertently trapping Standish in the time stream. Through S.T.E.V.E. and the Pizza Dude, Reggie convinces the settlers and Indians that pizza is a more acceptable food than turkeys, taking them off the Thanksgiving menu entirely. Reggie stays with Jenny while Jake takes S.T.E.V.E. in order to look for new adventures. In the mid-credits, Jake returns moments after leaving Reggie and Jenny. With a chicken and a duck in his wings, Jake starts to tell every turkey present about the turducken (indicating either Reggie's actions or Standish's \"erasure\" from history have had unexpected consequences on the present day)."

The site's consensus reads: \"Technically proficient yet creatively moribund, Free Birds begs unfortunate comparisons with the dim-witted fowl that inspired it.\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, has calculated a score of 38 based on 27 reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a negative review, saying \"This seemingly innocuous toon fantasy becomes another noxious-but-sanitized exercise in family-friendly cultural insensitivity.\" Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the film a negative review, saying \"Even setting aside the film's disregard for time-travel paradoxes and genocide metaphors\u2014trust me, you don't want to wade into either of those\u2014Free Birds just isn't funny.\" Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice gave the film a negative review, saying \"Like so many modern animated features, Free Birds packs too much in; the picture feels cramped and cluttered, and, despite its occasionally manic action, it moves as slowly as a fattened bird waddling toward its doom.\" Kate Erbland of Film.com gave the film a 7.6 out of 10, saying \"Free Birds is a more than worthy (and weird) holiday diversion for the whole family.\" Stephan Lee of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C, saying \"Often, you can point to a middling animated film's visuals as its saving grace. But this colonial world, which should feel like an expansive autumnal panorama, feels oddly inert and two-dimensional.\" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"The 3-D animated film, the first of the holiday entries, is likable and amusing, if slight.\" Chris Cabin of Slant Magazine gave the film one out of four stars, saying \"The film is absent of humor and thrills, and accented with designs and color schemes that are equally notable for their lack of risk.\" Sheri Linden of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, saying \"Like the ungainly avian creatures at the center of the herky-jerky adventure, this 'toon seldom gets off the ground.\" Jessica Herndon of the Associated Press gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"A solid premiere effort that shows Reel FX's potential to produce quality full-length animation. But the story-line, with its hypothetical constituents, seems a little desperate at times, even for a kiddie film.\" Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star gave the film one out of four stars, calling the film \"A seasonally pegged 3D cartoon bore that sets the bar so low, it could give a slug a concussion.\" Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film two out of four stars, calling the film \"A welcome foray into underexploited territory, conceptually at least.\" Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film two out of five stars, saying \"It isn't cute. It isn't really funny. It just kind of is.\" Louis Black of The Austin Chronicle gave the film one and a half stars out of five, saying \"Free Birds falls flat, despite its good intentions, ideological cuteness, humorous polish, and skillful computer animation. The fine voice talents of the almost-ideal cast are wasted.\" Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film two out of five stars, saying \"Most minor animated movies are so rote that it\u2019s worth acknowledging a strange bird like this cheerfully gonzo kid flick. It\u2019s no masterpiece, but if you\u2019re hoping for a family film that will keep everyone reasonably entertained, this will fly.\" Miriam Bale of The New York Times gave the film a negative review, saying \"The concept is inane, and the execution is manic and unoriginal.\" Sara Stewart of the New York Post gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying \"Is Hollywood scheming to turn your little ones into strident vegetarians? Could be, but I wish they\u2019d do it with material more inspired than Free Birds, a forgettable\u2014and occasionally borderline offensive\u2014animated tale of turkeys trying to take back Thanksgiving.\" David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying \"Free Birds is a stale turkey hash that heaves a lot of ingredients in the oven but never turns on the gas, a frantic attempt to come up with an animated film built around Thanksgiving Day traditions.\" Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying \"The movie's animal rights, vegetarian message should go down easily with politically correct parents\u2014at least until they choke on the offensive depiction of 17th-century turkeys as face-painted, headband-wearing native Americans.\" Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"Finally, there's a movie vegetarian parents can enjoy with their impressionable offspring.\" Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film one out of four stars, saying \"In execution, the film is all sidekicks and sight gags, with little story cohesion or purpose.\" Bill Zwecker of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a mixed review, saying \"No, Free Birds is not (sorry) a turkey of a film. But it doesn\u2019t really soar terribly high either. I only wish the quality of the writing in the earlier parts of the movie had been maintained throughout. If that had been the case, Reggie, Jake and their fellow turkeys just might have been flying high with the eagles\u2014our official national birds.\" Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review, saying \"Although it seldom approaches the inspiration of its plucky premise\u2014a pair of turkeys travel back in a time machine to the first Thanksgiving in a bid to scratch the traditional entree off the menu\u2014Free Birds nevertheless manages to avoid being branded a holiday turkey.\" Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying \"Everything about Free Birds feels perfunctory, from its generic title and holiday setting to its starry voice cast and undistinguished use of 3-D.\""

        "content": "is a 2013 action-adventure platform game developed by Sonic Team. It is part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and was released in October 2013 for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS in PAL regions by Nintendo and by Sega in North America and Japan. A port for Microsoft Windows was later released in November 2015. Lost World focuses on the efforts of Sonic the Hedgehog to stop the Deadly Six, an alien tribe that serves as the game's main antagonists, as they seek to siphon energy from the Lost Hex, the game's setting. Sonic and his long-time sidekick Tails must team up with Doctor Eggman, normally their enemy, to stop the Deadly Six, leading to conflicts among the three parties. While the gameplay is typical of the Sonic series in some ways, it adds parkour mechanics and features largely cylindrical level design with an emphasis on alternate pathways. The game also features the Wisp creatures from Sonic Colors as power-ups. The game began development shortly after the 2010 release of Sonic Colors. It was designed to be streamlined and fluid in movement and design, using tube-like level design and a simple, bright color scheme. The game received mixed reviews upon release; its controls and the Deadly Six were frequently criticized, but its visuals and audio were seen positively. Downloadable content was released both alongside and after the game's release, adding features such as additional levels and a new type of Wisp power."

        "content": "Sonic Lost World is a platform game with action-adventure elements, in which the player controls Sonic the Hedgehog as he travels across the Lost Hex in order to rescue captured animals and stop the Deadly Six. Levels range from side-scrolling 2D levels to fast-moving 3D linear levels to levels taking place on spherical worlds similar to the canceled Sonic X-treme and the Super Mario Galaxy series. This also translates to the 3DS version, as it was the first handheld game in the series presented entirely in 3D. The game uses a new control system which allows players to control Sonic's speed. Simply moving the directional controls will move Sonic at a moderate pace, allowing for more precision. Holding down a trigger button will cause Sonic to sprint, allowing him to move faster and perform new parkour moves, such as running up and along walls and hopping over small ledges. In the air, Sonic can perform a double jump, which returns from Sonic Colors, a homing attack, which can now target multiple enemies in quick succession, and a new kick attack, which can be used to defeat stronger enemies, or knock them into others. Also returning from Colors are the Wisp creatures, which provide short-lived power-ups to Sonic. The Wisps' powers are now controlled using the Wii U GamePad's touchscreen and gyroscopic features. Alongside returning powers such as Drill, Laser and Rocket, new powers include Eagle, which lets Sonic fly through the air, Asteroid, which atomizes objects in his path, and Rhythm, which lets him bounce along a path of notes. There are also some Wisps exclusive to each version of the game. During the game, players can rescue animals by destroying enemies or opening containers, allowing players to progress, or find Red Star Rings that open up circus-themed bonus stages where players can earn more animals. Collecting all the Red Star Rings in the game unlocks the ability to transform into Super Sonic. The Wii U version supports both co-operative multiplayer, in which a second player can control a remote controlled vehicle to assist Sonic, and competitive multiplayer, in which a second player can use the Wii U Gamepad screen to race against the other player. The game also supports Miiverse and Off-TV Play functionality. Using Miiverse, players can exchange items such as Wisps or shields, which grow more effective if they are used by other players. The 3DS version supports both local and online multiplayer for up to four players. Players may also customise RC vehicles in the 3DS version, which can then be used in the Wii U version."

While the two attempt to retrieve a falling capsule filled with animals, Eggman shoots down Tails' plane. However, they end up discovering a world in the sky known as the Lost Hex, and crash land there. As they explore the world, the duo discover that Eggman has enlisted the aid of a group of the world's indigenous Zeti race, collectively known as the Deadly Six, using a magical conch to keep them under his command. However, when Sonic rushes in and kicks the conch away, the Deadly Six betray Eggman and take control of his Badnik army. They then start to use one of Eggman's machines to siphon energy from Sonic's world below, planning to drain all of its life force until there is nothing left and use it to power themselves up. Reluctantly, Sonic agrees to work with Eggman, believing that he needs his help to stop the machine, though this seems to cause some distrust between him and Tails. As Sonic battles his way throughout the Lost Hex, the Deadly Six concoct a plan to capture Sonic and turn him into a robot under their control, but they end up accidentally capturing Tails instead. After Eggman is seemingly killed falling into lava, Sonic comes across the Deadly Six as they prepare to use the roboticized Tails against him. However, prior to the conversion, Tails managed to reprogram the process to retain his free will and instead helps Sonic to defeat them. Upon reaching the machine and finding it already switched off, Eggman reappears, having faked his death and used the energy harvested to power his latest giant mech. Sonic defeats Eggman, sending him falling to the planet's surface, and he and Tails restore the stolen energy to the world below before returning home. In a post-credits scene, Orbot and Cubot find Eggman, who has survived his fall, and they dig him out of a soft spot of dirt he landed on. Upon realizing that half of his mustache is missing, Eggman throws another tantrum, prompting Orbot and Cubot to run away in fear."

        "title": "Sonic Lost World_Development",
        "content": "Development for Sonic Lost World started shortly after Sonic Colors was finished, when a few core members started the experimentation for the former and took place over two-and-a-half years. Sonic Team sought to streamline the controls, increase the length, and add more diverse levels compared to previous entries in the series. After reviewing the history of the franchise with Sonic Generations, game producer Takashi Iizuka hoped to \"deliver a new experience\" with Sonic Lost World. Development started on PC, with early experiments involving \"twisted tube-type level[s]\" inspired by Jack and the Beanstalk. As the concept \"was totally new\", early levels had to be remade \"over and over.\" Players were given greater ability to control Sonic's speed in an effort to create a more traditional platforming experience. The parkour mechanic was introduced to maintain a more fluid sense of movement, in contrast to previous Sonic games where running into a wall would force the player to a complete stop. Iizuka stated that \"This game is like going into the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland, an action game where you can experience many strange and fun experiences.\" Development ultimately focused on the Wii U and 3DS because of the success of previous Sonic games on Nintendo platforms. Because Wii U \"has two monitors to use\", Sonic Team decided to include both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The Wii U GamePad's touch screen and gyroscope were employed to activate the returning Color Powers. The 3DS version, co-developed with Dimps, was designed to \"fully utilize\" the 3DS hardware with 3D gameplay and motion controls. Development was harder on 3DS due to its more limited processing power. Iizuka stated that the Color Powers are \"essential\" to the level design of the 3DS version, while they work as an \"additional tool\" in the Wii U version. A simple art style was used to make objects stand out more against the backgrounds, and to keep the game running at a consistent 60 frames per second. The design of the new \"Deadly Six\" villains was based on that of an ogre, and each one's appearance was intended to reflect a certain key characteristic of their personality, which the developers hoped players could see \"just by looking at them.\" The Wii U version of the game was directed by Morio Kishimoto, the director of Sonic Colors and the lead designer of Sonic and the Black Knight, while the 3DS version was directed by Takao Hirabayashi, the director of Sonic Colors DS, and previously lead designer of Sonic Unleashed PS2/Wii. Sega trademarked the title Sonic Lost World in May 2013. The game was revealed on May 17, 2013, in a Nintendo Direct announcement, as part of an exclusive partnership between Sega and Nintendo for the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It is one of three games in this partnership, the other ones being the fourth entry to the Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games series, and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal, a game based on the Sonic Boom animated series. Sega reported that more on the game would be revealed before E3 2013, and that the game would contain both returning and new original characters, both in enemies and friends of Sonic. The first trailer for the game was released on May 28, a day earlier than previously announced. A downloadable demo of the game's first stage was made available for both consoles on October 9 in Japan and in mid-November in North America and Europe. To promote the release of Sonic Lost World, Hardlight Studios released an update for Sonic Dash that includes a boss battle against Zazz, one of the Deadly Six. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U also includes a stage based on Windy Hill Zone from the game as well. The soundtrack was composed and directed by Tomoya Ohtani, with Takahito Eguchi handling the orchestration and cutscene music. Naofumi Hataya also contributed a single piece, the theme for \"Desert Ruins Zone - Act 3\". A three-disc soundtrack, Sonic Lost World Original Soundtrack Without Boundaries, was released physically in Japan and digitally worldwide via iTunes and Amazon Music on November 27, 2013."

        "content": "Sonic Lost World received mixed or average reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. During its opening week in the UK, Sonic Lost World charted at #11 on the All-formats chart for sales, but achieved the top spot on the Wii U chart and #4 on the Nintendo 3DS chart. As of the end of 2013, Sega had shipped 640,000 copies of the game. As of March 31, 2014, the game had sold 710,000 copies. The game's presentation was well received. Chris Plante (Polygon) praised the Wii U version's visuals and music as \"arguably the best\" in the series. Tim Turi (Game Informer) wrote that \"The orchestrated tracks evoke Mario Galaxy in the best ways.\" Mark Walton (GameSpot) and Chris Scullion (Computer and Video Games) singled out the candy-themed \"Dessert Ruins\" level as a visual highlight. However, Turi made note of \"ultra-compressed\" cutscenes in the 3DS version. Vince Ingenito (IGN) was favorable to the \"pleasant\" art direction and stable framerate, but criticized the \"subdued\" color palette. Roger Hargreaves (Metro) stated that the \"imaginative\" designs and \"spectacular set piece[s]\" kept him \"interested to know what comes next.\" Chris Schilling (Eurogamer) was effusive: \"Blue skies forever!\" Strong criticism was directed at the game's control scheme, especially the new parkour mechanic. Turi \"never got a good feel for the rhythm of wall running and jumping, and felt lucky to pass sections where it was forced.\" Hargreaves, Walton, and Matthew Castle (Official Nintendo Magazine) agreed. Ingenito found it problematic that Sonic tends to wall-run on every nearby vertical surface. Schilling singled out the multi-lock homing attack, writing that while it usually worked \"perfectly well\", it appeared to \"inexplicably fail\" on occasion. Ingenito, Turi, and Hargreaves agreed. Castle struggled with the homing attack \"locking on too late or attacking enemies in awkward sequence.\" However Justin Towell (GamesRadar) defended the control scheme, explaining that while it had a learning curve, it also \"modernize[s] environmental traversal\" and \"provide[s] a distinct safety net\". Towell argued that Sonic was mainly hard to control in 2D because there are \"so many rules for how Sonic reacts contextually to his environment\". Reona Ebihara (Famitsu) stated that the ability to slow down made the game easier to play for beginners. However, Turi criticized Sonic's \"odd sense of momentum\" and imprecise jumps, stating that switching between two speeds is \"jarring\" and produces \"touchy platforming\". Schilling excoriated the \"profoundly frustrating\" controls as the worst in the series, explaining that \"Sonic's too sluggish while walking, and too skittish to cope with the trickier platforming bits when running\". Ingenito agreed: \"I've played a lot of Sonic over the years, and the controls have never felt as alien and inconsistent as they do here.\" Several critics felt that Sonic controlled better on the 3DS. Jose Otero (IGN) said the parkour \"felt great\" and \"turned most obstructions into minor hurdles\" in this version. Joe Skrebels (Official Nintendo Magazine) felt that Sonic \"controls far better at top speed on 3DS\". Stephen Totilo (Kotaku) stated that the 3DS version does a better job of teaching the controls, although Turi derided its \"constant, lengthy tutorial text\". However, Schilling called the homing attack \"even more capricious\" on 3DS. Reaction to the game's level design was mixed. Turi made note of oddly placed invisible springs in the Wii U version's \"confusing\" and \"aggravating\" levels, and expressed frustration with the 3DS version's \"head-scratching\" puzzles. Walton preferred the \"inoffensive\" 2D sections to the \"frustrating mishmash of speed and exploration\" found in 3D. Plante praised the Wii U version's 3D stages as \"wildly creative exercises in platforming experimentation\" while decrying its 2D stages as \"so clunky and tiresome that it's hard to imagine a time when a side-scrolling Sonic was actually good.\" Philip Kollar (Polygon) was harsher on the 3DS version due to its \"confusing and labyrinthine\" level design and \"awkward puzzles\". Ingenito stated that the Wii U version's levels were stuck in \"design gridlock\" and \"lack[ed] rhythm and cohesion\". Otero praised the 3DS version's \"better levels\" as \"competently made race tracks full of alternate pathways\", but called the \"trial and error\" required to complete the \"slower-paced 3D stages\" \"incredibly frustrating\". Castle stated that the Wii U version's \"best stages play to the strengths of Sonic's tiered speed\", while Skrebels felt the 3DS version featured levels well-suited for handheld play. Totilo praised \"the intuitive, flowing, player-friendly levels of the 3DS version\" but panned \"the badly-explained, choppy, punitive levels of the Wii U version\". Schilling wrote that \"I came perilously close to biting my GamePad at one particularly sharp difficulty spike.\" Edge noted that \"Sonic games, and platformers in general, have always been about memorizing the lay of the land, but rarely have mistakes been so costly or heavily punished.\" The alternate gameplay styles polarized many critics. Daniel Cairns (VideoGamer.com) and Castle highlighted the level where Sonic becomes a giant snowball as \"genuinely excellent\" and \"a cool riff on Monkey Ball\", whereas Turi and Ingenito described it as \"atrocious\", \"uncontrollabl[e]\" and \"the exact opposite of fun\". Turi \"received multiple game overs during a mundane mandatory pinball sequence.\" Walton felt that some of the Wisps were an \"amusing aside,\" but problematic motion controls and short time limits impaired their utility. Justin Speer (GameTrailers) stated that the Wisps felt out-of-place in the Wii U version. Totilo preferred how the Wisps were implemented in the 3DS version, but Towell stated that while they were \"more integral\" to the design, they tended to interrupt \"the free-form gameplay\" with \"clumsy mechanic[s]\". Towell described the 3DS version's motion-controlled Special Stages as \"borderline unplayable\". Totilo and Castle criticized the Wii U version's Jetpack Joyride-style flying levels as \"regrettable\" and \"horribly imprecise\". Turi and Totilo criticized the Wii U version's balloon-popping minigame as \"mind-numbing\" and \"awkward\". Turi called the Wii U version's co-op mode \"useless\". Castle wrote that \"Two-player races would be a cool addition were it not for the horrible framerate issues.\" The Deadly Six were negatively received. Although Towell enjoyed their \"fun, stereotypical personalities\", he was disappointed by their \"awful\" dialogue. Speer called the boss battles \"weirdly anticlimactic\", and Ingenito stated they were \"some of the most boring in the series' history\". Turi referred to the Deadly Six as \"generic\", \"forgettable\", and \"some of the most aggressively annoying villains ever.\" EGM Now observed that the Deadly Six's presence \"does subvert the worn-out Sonic-versus-Dr. Eggman concept,\" adding: \"I can\u2019t figure out if the plot is brilliantly aware self-parody or whether it was scrawled together by a couple of grade-schoolers on a Tokyo playground\u2014both options seem equally probable, frankly.\" Critics disagreed over what to make of the game as a whole. In 2015, USgamer referred to Lost World as \"perhaps Sonic's best outing in years.\" Jim Sterling (Destructoid) said it \"can wildly swing from brilliant to horrific at the drop of a hat, but when one steps back and takes a look at the whole production, one sees far more to love than hate.\" Plante noted that \"the early stages display a degree of design ingenuity and polish which gradually degrades\". David McComb (Empire) called it \"A cheap, cruel, crushing disappointment in the wake of Sonic Colors and Generations.\" Walton concluded that \"in overtly coveting the great Italian plumber, it smothers the talents of its blazing blue hedgehog.\""

        "content": "(The Return of Tobias) is an oratorio in two parts composed in 1775 by Joseph Haydn (Hob. XXI:1). The work is the first oratorio the composer wrote and, according to Jones, was \"his most extended and ambitious composition up to that time\". The Italian-language libretto of the work is by , brother of the composer Luigi Boccherini. This libretto is harshly criticized by Olleson, who notes that the author de-dramatizes vivid episodes in the source (the story of Tobit in the Apocrypha), depriving Haydn of the opportunity for highly dramatic musical utterance. The work was premiered in Vienna on 2 April 1775, under the sponsorship of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, a musician's benevolent society. The musical forces were substantial: Smither writes: \"characteristic of the large forces used for the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t concerts, the orchestra, chorus, and soloists possibly numbered more than 180 performers.\" He adds that the premiere was \"enormously successful.\" In 1784, Haydn substantially revised the work, with cuts to make numbers shorter and new choruses, for another of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t's benefit concerts. It is thought that at this concert Haydn first met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who became his good friend. One of the soprano soloists was Nancy Storace, also a friend of Haydn, who later was Mozart's first Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro. In 1808 the oratorio made a third appearance on the program of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, this time in a revised version by the now-elderly composer's pupil, Sigismund Neukomm. The performance on the night of 22 December, which required the labors of most of the highly qualified musicians in Vienna, had regrettable consequences for a now-famous rival concert taking place in Vienna on the same evening, the benefit for Ludwig van Beethoven that premiered his Fifth and Sixth Symphonies. Today, Il ritorno di Tobia is eclipsed by Haydn's later works in this genre \u2013 The Creation and The Seasons \u2013 and is seldom performed or recorded."

        "content": "On 21 February 2012, five members of the group staged a performance on the soleas of Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior. Their actions were stopped by church security officials. By evening, they had turned it into a music video entitled \"Punk Prayer - Mother of God, Chase Putin Away!\". The women said their protest was directed at the Orthodox Church leader's support for Putin during his election campaign. On 3 March, two of the group members, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, were arrested and charged with hooliganism. A third member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was arrested on 16 March. Denied bail, they were held in custody until their trial began in late July. On 17 August, the three members were convicted of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred, and each was sentenced to two years imprisonment. Two other members of the group, who escaped arrest after February's protest, reportedly left Russia fearing prosecution. On 10 October, following an appeal, Samutsevich was freed on probation, her sentence suspended. The sentences of the other two women were upheld. In late October, Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova were separated and sent to prison. The trial and sentence attracted considerable criticism, particularly in the West. The case was adopted by human rights groups including Amnesty International, which designated the women prisoners of conscience, and by a wide range of musicians including Madonna, Sting, and Yoko Ono. Public opinion in Russia was generally less sympathetic towards the women. Putin stated that the band had \"undermined the moral foundations\" of the nation and \"got what they asked for\". Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said he did not think the three members of Pussy Riot should have been sent to jail, but stressed that the release of the remaining two imprisoned members was a matter for the courts."

It was released digitally on 16 August 2013 and three days later physically in France and Belgium. Stromae expressed his desire to incorporate Caribbean and African musical influences along with his signature 1990s-inspired dance beats. The album, recorded in an attic, explores themes as diverse as alienation from social networks, relationship issues, discrimination, cigarettes and lung cancer, AIDS and absent father figures. Prior to its official release and afterwards, Racine carr\u00e9e received critical acclaim for its thoughtful lyrics and gained comparisons to fellow Belgian recording artist Jacques Brel. The album was a commercial success across Western Europe, including non-francophone countries. Racine carr\u00e9e topped the charts in France, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Italy, as well as reaching the top ten in Canada, and the top forty in Germany. In his native Belgium, it remained at the top the charts for multiple weeks and been certified twelve times platinum by the BEA. In France, the album has been certified quadruple diamond by the SNEP and become one of the highest-selling albums in recent years after amassing over one million copies sold four months after its release. Racine carr\u00e9e yielded three chart-topping singles: \"Papaoutai\", \"Formidable\" and \"Tous les m\u00eames\"."

The opening week numbers were higher than the 75,000 copies his previous album, Cheese, had sold since its release. The following week, the album sold 50,901 copies but was replaced at the top of the chart by the second volume of tribute album G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Goldman, which sold 59,274 units. By the end of September and after only six weeks of release, Racine carr\u00e9e had crossed the 300,000 mark and spent five non-consecutive weeks at number one. In the last week of October, the album surpassed Daft Punk's Random Access Memories as the best selling album of 2013; up to that point the former had sold 475,500 copies while the latter had amassed 469,700 units. In its eighteenth week on the chart, just before Christmas, Racine carr\u00e9e remained at number one for a sixteenth non-consecutive week at the top with its biggest weekly sales and the second-best weekly score of 2013, 182,034 units, just behind the 195,013 copies Random Access Memories sold in its first week of availability. This allowed it to cross the million mark in just four months; the last album to sell over one million copies was Adele's 21 (2011), which took eleven months. In francophone Europe, Racine carr\u00e9e also experienced massive success. In his native Belgium, Stromae's second album opened at number one in both Flanders and Wallonia. In the former, Racine carr\u00e9e spent 17 non-consecutive weeks at number one; while in the latter, it remained at the top for 26 non-consecutive weeks. In late December, the album was certified seven times platinum by the Belgian Entertainment Association, denoting shipments of over 140,000 copies in the country. Additionally, Racine carr\u00e9e finished the year as the best-selling album in both Flanders and Wallonia. In Switzerland, the album also debuted at number one and held the top spot for four additional weeks. In French-speaking Romandie, the album spent fourteen non-consecutive weeks at number one and remained in the top three for several weeks after its release in late August. In addition, Racine carr\u00e9e has been certified 5\u00d7 platinum by the Swiss branch of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, denoting shipments of 75,000 units. In Canada, the album debuted within the top ten and remained in the chart for only three weeks. Success was not limited to francophone countries; the album also sold well in Germany and the Netherlands. In Germany, Racine carr\u00e9e debuted just outside the top twenty in the main albums chart and at the top of the digital albums chart. In the Netherlands, the album debuted at number sixteen; the following week it climbed five positions to reach number eleven, its highest chart rank up to that point. After falling below the top forty and reaching positions as low as fifty-seven for two weeks, it eventually rebounded and entered the top ten for the first time in mid-December. The album later peaked within the top three. According to MegaCharts, the album finished the year as the fifty-eighth highest-selling album in the Netherlands. In Austria, the album did not reach the chart but sold constantly in the lower sales regions, eventually reaching gold."

        "content": "\"Papaoutai\" was released as the lead single in mid-May 2013. The autobiographical song tells the story of a young boy who is looking for his father. Stromae revealed that his father was killed during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The music video shows him adopting the style and pose of a 1940s mannequin, representing the absent father and the young version of him trying to interact with the mannequin. The single became an instant hit in France and Wallonia, where it spent multiple weeks at number one; it also reached the top ten in Switzerland and Luxembourg as well as non-francophone countries or regions such as the Czech Republic, Dutch-speaking Flanders in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. \"Formidable\" was released as the follow-up single to \"Papaoutai\" in June 2013. The music video, filmed in the streets of Brussels, was particularly notorious for displaying Stromae wandering at the Louise/Louiza tram and metro station during the daybreak, where the singer appears to be completely drunk. The song tells the story of a drunk man recently separated from his girlfriend. It eventually topped the charts in France and the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking regions of Belgium, reached the top five in the Netherlands, the top twenty in Switzerland and the top forty in Austria and Germany. \"Tous les m\u00eames\" was officially released as the third single from the album in December 2013. The song displays the various stereotypical traits and behaviours of men and women alike. The music video for the single shows Stromae half-dressed as a woman and acting annoyed by the attitude of men and what they do; to further aid the interpretation, green lighting effects are used for male Stromae and pink ones for female Stromae. The single became Stromae's third consecutive number one from Racine carr\u00e9e in France and Wallonia, while reaching the top five in Flanders and charting in the Netherlands and Switzerland. \"Ta f\u00eate\" was released on 3 February 2014. The track served as the anthem for the Belgium national football team during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. \"Ave Cesaria\" was released on 21 July 2014. The track honours Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora, one of Stromae's favourite artists who died in 2011. \"Carmen\" was released on 20 March 2015. The track was inspired by L'amour est un oiseau rebelle, an aria from the 1875 opera Carmen by Georges Bizet, hence the song's title. \"Quand c'est?\" was released on 14 September 2015."

        "content": "The Wikipedia was started in the beginning of 2005, along with the Wolof Wikipedia and the Fula Wikipedia. Kasper Souren, a Dutchman who worked with Geekcorps, established this Wikipedia while working in a mission in Mali. In December 2007 the Bambara Wikipedia had 142 articles and the Wikipedia in Fula had 28 articles. According to Souren, he was volunteering in Mali in 2005 when he first encountered the Bambara language. Souren wrote in a report to an open source conference a Geekcorps Mali volunteer had created a side project where a person who wrote for the Wikipedia received $1 U.S. per article. Souren went to Bamako and met people at a community center. He paid each person willing to write an article $1 U.S. The authors had no internet connections and no Wikipedia usernames. They wrote articles in Microsoft Word and gave the files to Souren. Souren uploaded each article and credited the authors. Souren wrote \"I can\u2019t understand 100 percent of what they wrote, but I could estimate that it was right. It is a Wikipedia anyway, so I hope they can correct it.\" The total expenses of the project amounted to fewer than $100 U.S. In regards to the payment, Ndesanjo Macha, a Wikipedian who speaks Swahili, argued that it is unnecessary to pay editors for their efforts, and he believed he was speaking for everyone in Africa. Noam Cohen of The New York Times wrote \"Most of the people who have heard about Mr. Souren's decision to pay for entries lauded his goal but questioned his tactics, saying that they undercut the Wikipedia spirit, and that, ultimately, a Bambara Wikipedia would work only if there was a voluntary community to support it.\" This project resulted in the partial translation of the interfaces of the Bambara and Fula Wikipedias and the creation of some articles for those Wikipedias. Souren wrote that after 2005 the Bambara and Fula Wikipedias had \"only sparse activity\". In December 2007 the Bambara Wikipedia had 142 articles and the Wikipedia in Fula had 28 articles. In 2013 Valentin Vydrin, lead creator of the \"Bamana Reference Corpus (BRC)\", wrote that \"The Bambara Wikipedia counts a couple of hundred entries, most of them rudimentary and often written without any respect for the rules of orthography.\""

        "content": "Stevens recalls that his entire album was done in two sessions. For this first one he was to be accompanied by Alan Kendall and Maurice's friend John Bonham from Led Zeppelin. Bonham was busy elsewhere at the start of the session and a drummer Heydon Jones was hired quickly to fill in. The songs were recorded with Stevens singing and playing piano at the same time, Kendall playing acoustic guitar, and Jones or Bonham on drums. Stevens and the engineers were very happy with the results. In particular Bonham's powerful drumming touched off an impassioned performance by Stevens on the title track, which would be the English title song to the album. Gibb was supervising the session, but he did not play together with them. Later he added bass to all but \"Sweet Child of Mine\" (which is just Stevens with orchestra), organ on \"Don\u2019t Freak Me Out\", keyboard on \"When You Grow Up\", and Bill Shepherd orchestration to three songs. Kendall's acoustic guitar was just about mixed out, but he or Maurice added electric rhythm guitar to \"High Heel Blues\". All this tinkering changed the raw feel of the basic tracks. The second session for the album was in May 1972, and features Peter Frampton on guitar, Mike Kellie on drums and the orchestra was arranged by Gerry Shury. Frampton played electric guitar instead on the \"Bye Bye Love\" and added electric guitar to two others. Frampton, who was a member of Humble Pie, recorded his first solo album Wind of Change around this time, and Kellie, late of Spooky Tooth, was the drummer on it, while Bee Gees\u2019 tour drummer Chris Karan played percussion.  Two of the album's songs, \"Paid My Dues\" and \"Tears\" were covered by then former Spooky Tooth lead singer Mike Harrison, on Smokestack Lightning, his second solo album, also released in 1972,"

Another theme was Literature and this magazine is one of the few samples from the liberal Catalan Romanticism. \u201cEl Propagador de la libertad\u201d defended the social function of literature and it fight against Classicism like a movement that had been overcome. It spread the works of Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo and Heine. The collaborators of the magazine were A. Fontcuberta, Pere Mata, F. Alt\u00e9s i Gurena, A. Ribot, Gener i Solanes, Antoni Gironella, J. Eydoux and J. Strozzi. This staff changed as a consequence of the revolutionary successes from 1836 because a lot of the writers were arrested and exiled. As a result, A. Fontcuberta, who used the pseudonym of Josep Andreu Covert-Spring started directing the magazine. Some of the collaborators changed too and in this period we can find Pau Piferrer, Manuel Mil\u00e0 i Fontanals and Joaquim M. Bover. The objective of spreading the new ideas among the farmers was not achieved due to the high intellectual level of the magazine, which was a barrier for this social group. At the end, \u201cEl Propagador de la libertad\u201d was one of the most important literary, cultural and scientific magazines of its period due to its connections with the progressive current of thought."

On June 8, 1838, in a letter to his friend Svyatoslav Rayevsky he wrote: \"The novel that we've started stalked and will hardly get another start, for the circumstances that formed its background changed, and you know, I won't go against the truth.\" Rayevsky was by no means a co-author: he was only writing down what Lermontov was dictating him. Most of the characters of Princess Ligovskaya had their real prototypes. Varvara Lopukhina (whom Lermontov was in love with) featured as Vera, her husband Nikolai Bakhmetyev as Prince Ligovskoy. In Elizaveta Negurova the author portrayed Yekaterina Sushkova, whom he's had an uneasy relationship with, described in full detail in his 1835 letter to cousin Alexandra Vereshchagina. Critics noticed that Pechorin bears strong resemblance to Lermontov. On the other hand, there are obvious parallels to Alexander Pushkin's Yevgeny Onegin (both heroes' second names are derived from the names of rivers Pechora and Onega)."

It was aired for the first time on 27 July 2013 on Channel 4, in conjunction with Pulse Films and One Little Indian Records. Partly filmed at the Natural History Museum in London, the documentary features an encounter between Icelandic singer-songwriter and musician Bj\u00f6rk and English broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough. They discuss the nature of music and the intersection between music, nature and technology. It also follows the singer as she prepares for her Biophilia Tour, along with rehearsal and studio recording. The documentary was inspired by the singer's eighth studio album Biophilia (2011), which was released as a series of apps which blends nature elements with musicology. Collaborators in the project Scott Snibbe, Damian Taylor, and Andy Cavatorta appear in the documentary to talk about their role in the development of the album and the live show. It also includes neurologist Oliver Sacks, who talks about the effect of music on the brain. Despite the low ratings, the show received positive to moderate reviews from critics, who applauded the content of the documentary but, in some cases, criticised the interaction between Attenborough and Bj\u00f6rk, which was considered \"awkward\" and \"unlikely\". The documentary was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 5 May 2014."

        "content": "When the Biophilia project was first unveiled, it was announced that a documentary including footage of studio recording, interviews and rehearsal for the live performances, which would culminate in the first live performance at the Manchester International Festival, was in the works. While the original idea for the documentary never materialised, the project evolved as a mutual collaboration between David Attenborough and Bj\u00f6rk herself. On 1 August 2012, it was reported that UK Channel 4 had inked a deal to air a documentary, tentatively titled Attenborough and Bj\u00f6rk: The Nature of Music, that would have included a discussion between the two about the story of music, human's relationship with it and how technology could evolve the way we engage with it. The documentary was inspired by the Biophilia project and would have featured footage commented by Attenborough, along with a showcase of the instruments created for the Biophilia Tour. British-American neurologist Oliver Sacks was also reported to appear in the documentary, explaining \"the extraordinary and beneficial effects music has on our brains\". The documentary, made by the company Pulse Films, is the first time the British television channel and the company had collaborated. It was directed by Louise Hooper and executive produced by Lucas Ochoa, who commented about the project: \"Born from Bjork's revolutionary music project we are thrilled to be able to document this incredible journey with her; she is undeniably one of the most iconic figures in popular culture and truly pushes boundaries like no other artist does.\" The English naturalist had previously provided the spoken introduction for the live shows and the apps. The two had long admired each other's works. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bj\u00f6rk had confessed that, when she was a kid, she considered Attenborough her \"rock star\". Attenborough stated that the singer \"is really quite enchanting\" and called her \"honey\" during the filming, reportedly because he could not pronounce her name properly. Bj\u00f6rk stated about the experience of the filming with Attenborough: \"He would close off and take in whatever I was saying, and then just come out with the most beautifully formed sentences you ever heard\". Director Hooper, whose father John had filmed Attenborough in different documentaries settled in Papua New Guinea, Mali and the Amazon rainforest, had stated: \"There is an unexpected chemistry and fun between these two unique characters. They are both icons of their own separate worlds of music and nature, and both excited and curious to explore how these two worlds come together. Seeing Bjork and Sir David laughing and engaging with each other on screen is simply magical, it was fascinating to have the chance to bring Sir David and Bjork together for the first time on television. They were both great fun to work with; Bjork fizzing with ideas for the film and Sir David bringing his passion and knowledge\". The documentary was scheduled to air during November 2012 and to see a later limited cinema release in an extended cut. As of November 2012, the documentary was still in the editing. In June 2013, it was reported that the documentary would have its worldwide premiere at the Cortona Mix Festival in Italy. The festival then cancelled the projection. The documentary first aired on Channel 4 on 27 July 2013 as part of a series of documentaries called Mad4Music, now titled When Bj\u00f6rk Met Attenborough. When a crowdfunding was created on Kickstarter to fund the release of Biophilia on Android, one of the reward available for the backers who would have pledged \u00a3120 or more was one early viewing DVD copy of the documentary. After Bj\u00f6rk had found a cheaper way to transport the apps on Android, the funding was cancelled. On 21 March 2014, it was announced that the documentary would be released on 5 May 2014 on DVD and Blu-ray. Before the release of the DVD, the documentary was shown for three nights at the MK2 Grand Palais in Paris, and it was also shown during the We Love Green festival."

        "title": "When Bj\u00f6rk Met Attenborough_Synopsis",
        "content": "The documentary opens with an introduction by Tilda Swinton, who gives a backstory about Bj\u00f6rk's career and her intention with the Biophilia project, stating that the singer conceived the project wanting to redefine music in the 21st Century. Images from the \"Moon and \"Mutual Core\" music videos accompany her speech. After that, some frames focus on the Graduale Nobili who are singing the backing vocals to \"Thunderbolt\" on a cliff in front of the ocean in Iceland. Thereafter the scene shifts to an early rehearsal of the Biophilia songs in Iceland during November 2010. The choir begin to learn their parts in \"Thunderbolt\" and \"Moon\" under the guide of the singer. After that, the documentary shows the encounter between Bj\u00f6rk and Sir David Attenborough in the Natural History Museum in London. There, the naturalist and the singer discuss about the nature of music. They first talk about the importance of music and singing in the nature, with Attenborough explaining how music works for birds like the bird-of-paradise and the lyrebird, whose chirping is defined by the naturalist the \"most complex sound ever\", and he goes on by stating that the bird has developed an \"impressive vocal range\" which he compares to that of Bj\u00f6rk. Attenborough states that the human larynx is capable of many more sounds that preceded language. Therefore, the singer asks him how he thinks music works for the modern people, and the naturalist explains how he thinks popular music is \"extremely sexual\", comparing popular music to medieval troubadors, and that is why is so relatable to young people and animals, i.e. the gibbons, which mate by singing together out of excitement. Attenborough affirms that \"the mystery is how music has been used by humanity for something that is transcendental\". Footage from another rehearsal with the choir singing \"Dark Matter\" are shown before shifting to the encounter between Bj\u00f6rk and Henry Dagg in a metal workshop. Dagg had created the Sharpsichord, a solar powered cross between a harp and a barrel organ, which Bj\u00f6rk wanted to incorporate in one song. They are shown rehearsing \"Sacrifice\" and discussing the composition of the song. Attenborough states that our emotion comes from nature and that a composer has to be in contact with it. He then manages to compare the sound of Benjamin Britten's Sea interludes (which is playing in the background) to the sound of waves. The natural structure of music inspires Bj\u00f6rk who wants to bring nature in her composition. To discuss \"Crystalline\", Bj\u00f6rk and Attenborough go to the crystal room of the museum. They talk about the mathematical basis of Bj\u00f6rk's songs, who explains the time signatures of the verses and the chorus of \"Crystalline\" and compares the composition of a crystal to that of a song. Scenes from the choir recording parts of \"Crystalline\" guided by Biophilia musical director Matt Robertson are shown. Attenborough thinks that the beauty of mathematics can be heard in composition like the \"Fugue 5\" by Johann Sebastian Bach. Swinton tells how universe is made of patterns which are present in music but that we can't visualise, and how Bj\u00f6rk wants to change that. Because of that, the singer collaborates with Evan Grant, who works with cymatics. Grant explains how the Chladni plate works, and that he appreciates how Bj\u00f6rk tries to bring a real meaning in her music by taking a \"scientific and realistic approach\" to it. Grant tries to use cymatics on water for \"Crystalline\", which results can be seen in the music video for the song (directed by Michel Gondry). Swinton explains how Bj\u00f6rk's aim is to bring nature on stage for the Biophilia performance. Footage from the final rehearsal at Campfield Market Hall in Manchester for Biophilia world premiere at the Manchester International Festival is shown, with the Sharpsichord arriving at the venue. Some of other instruments used during the show are presented, like MIDI-controlled Tesla coil, invented by Nikola Tesla, and a gravity-harnessed pendulum harp invented by Andy Cavatorta of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Cavatorta recounts how Bj\u00f6rk declared to him that she wanted nature to appear like \"some sort of a rock star on stage\", and tells that the first prototypes of the instruments were filmed and shown to Bj\u00f6rk before she approved the final result. In one of the prototypes video the inventor puts a figurine of Bj\u00f6rk (as pictured in the Volta album cover) between the swings. The instrument, created solely for the \"Solstice\" performance, was commissioned because, as Bj\u00f6rk declares, the singer \"got obsessed\" with basslines (she hums a bassline of a composition by John Tavener as she says so). One of the major inspiration of the project itself, neurologist Oliver Sacks, who Bj\u00f6rk define as the \"David Attenborough of the brain\", lists the benefits music has on human and explains how when a human listens to music every part of the brain gets involved. This is very useful to people who suffers from dementia, who need evocative music which can help them in building a bridge to their past. Scenes from a nursing home, in which various patients with dementia are shown to benefit from different music played to them, accompany Sacks' speech. He affirms that the music expresses something that language can't. Scenes from the first performance of Biophilia are shown. David Attenborough's intro, which accompany the show, is partially heard, while Bj\u00f6rk affirms that music is a catalyst between the outer world and the inner world. A performance of \"Thunderbolt\" is partially shown, during which the singer is seen wearing a dress by Michael van der Ham, along with a big red wig, while the Tesla coil plays on stage. Swinton states that Biophilia \"nature, music and technology come together\" and that the Icelandic singer wants to develop a new kind of music-making which is \"intuitive and accessible for everyone\". This is driven by her desire to change we think of music, because, as the singer herself explains, by recounting her musical education, the \"academic approach to music is a barrier to people actually making music\". Oliver Sacks agrees with her by stating that the sheet music and the keys of a piano are \"intimidating and much more complicated than language\". Because of that, the singer tries to use technology to make it more intuitive. As a consequence of this, Bj\u00f6rk works with Damian Taylor. Taylor tries to use a ball and a cardboard box, along with a gamepad, instead of a keyboard. Bj\u00f6rk's solution came with the diffusion of tablet computer, which touch screen the singer compares to a tambourine for its being spontaneous and instinctive. By developing this idea, she decides to make a different format of album, made with apps. She works with interactive media artist Scott Snibbe, who states that her aim is the turn music \"into something full sensory\". Bj\u00f6rk explains some of the apps that are part of the album, like \"Moon\", which app deals with sequences, \"Mutual Core\", in which chords are represented with strata, and \"Thunderbolt\", which use lightnings as visual representation of arpeggios. Bj\u00f6rk states that a famous example of arpeggio is \"I Feel Love\" by Donna Summer. Snibbe then affirms that, \"if we change the visual representation, the way in which people think about music is changed\". To engage people with her new conception of music, Bj\u00f6rk rolls out a programme of music workshops for children in school around the world (footage from a workshop in Buenos Aires is shown) which, as Swinton informs, is now a standard part of the music curriculum in Iceland. Bj\u00f6rk confesses that she always dreamt about running a music school and that she considers this project her music school. After one year from the first show in Manchester, the Biophilia Tour reaches the World Sacred Music Festival in Fes, Morocco, during which Bj\u00f6rk is seen performing \"Cosmogony\". Sacks finally states that \"music unify people at an elementary level\". The documentary ends with a final conversation between Bj\u00f6rk and Attenborough, in which the naturalist affirms: \"Music, to be most rewarding, [...] does require work, and does require concentration, does require thought, which is why your music is so challenging, because it does require thought. So much of what you do, is completely new, [and] hasn't been done by people before, and that's what's challenging about that. So, if you're very tired, I don't suggest that they put on your music. I put on your music when I really want to think about something.\" To which Bj\u00f6rk blushes, and then the pair laugh together. The end credits roll to \"Cosmogony\" in the background."

        "content": "The documentary received moderately positive reviews. According to Ceri Radford of The Telegraph, who gave the documentary 4 stars out of 5, \"the documentary brought together the revered naturalist and the swan-donning Icelandic singer for an inspiring if at times confusing symposium on the relationship between music, technology and the natural world\". The journalist praised Biophilia by affirming that \"the whole idea was tantalisingly tangled\" and that \"any single aspect of Biophilia would have made for a fascinating documentary in its own right\", while defining the parts with Oliver Sacks \"touching\" and concluding \"from footage of spinning stars to shoals of fish to the snow-speckled hills above Reykjav\u00edk, from the sound of crackling electricity to Bj\u00f6rk's soaring voice, there was a dreamy and unsettling evocation of awe. It might not all have made sense, but it was a delight to the senses.\" Jordan Morgan of Tomorrow's News defined the couple \"the most unlikely expectations of collaborations\" but goes on by stating \"When Bjork met David Attenborough is a fascinating, albeit slightly confusing, documentary that joins the translucent dots between humans, nature and music and provides for an extremely informative learning lesson, [...] as well as creating something new to hear, Bj\u00f6rk also sets out to create a visual image for what people are hearing, adding another dimension to what you hear\". Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote that, although he \"[doesn't] always totally understand what she's on about, [...] the bits with David Attenborough at the Natural History Museum are lovely\", and later compared their interaction to \"an old man showing his granddaughter round his favourite place in the world\" but found Bj\u00f6rk \"a little bit shy with him\" and \"grand-daughterly\". Caitlin Moran of The Times called the duo \"a proper super-hero pairing\". Ian Cross, professor of music and science of the University of Cambridge, commented about the documentary: \"if there has to be something about music on television on a Saturday evening, I'd rather hear the views of Bj\u00f6rk and David Attenborough than those of the music hedge fund manager Simon Cowell\". Mike Higgins, who gave the show 2 stars out of 5, writing on The Independent, billed the encounter as \"awkward\" and gave a negative review of the documentary, finding it \"[not] much more than a promo for Bj\u00f6rk's last album, Biophilia, and its tour\" and further stating: \"The 87-year-old doesn't so much speak in complete paragraphs as lectures in complete chapters. In their conversations \u2013 on crystallography, the power of the human larynx, et al \u2013 Attenborough was in transmit mode, jabbing away with his index finger. All Bj\u00f6rk could do was chip in now and then, in her Reykjav\u00edk by way of south London accent. When the big man let rip on the notion that all \"song\" in the natural word is about sex, and so, therefore, is popular music, Bj\u00f6rk reacted as we all did, I suspect, and looked a bit embarrassed.\""

He reasoned that the lyrics were just too personal and would not interest the general public. Calling his wife Dominique from the studio while recording his prospective album, he sang her parts of the song on the telephone.

The young doctor Ivan Pavlov wants to live life \"honorably and humanely.\" The path of the scientist is difficult and thorny. The treasury department does not release funds for research nor give access to animals for experimental use and Pavlov has to buy them on his own savings. The experiments follow one another. Pavlov is pursuing his goal with passion and force. For his work on the physiology of digestion he is awarded the Nobel Prize. Pavlov paves the way for objective studies of brain function in higher animals. Zvantsev, the assistant of Pavlov is an idealist who has become an ideological opponent of the scientist-materialist, implores him not to interfere with the \"sanctuary of the spirit\", but Pavlov boldly ignores his opponents-obscurantists. The revolutionary 1917 year comes. Pavlov angrily rejects the proposal of an American agent to go abroad; he decides to forever remain with his people in his homeland."

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 59, based on five reviews, which indicates \"mixed or average reviews\". Tim McNamara of The Australian called album \"assured, confident and cohesive\" and praised it as a \"fantastic, upbeat and dance-inducing fare, signalling the resurgence of an act that has bet everything on doing their third album their way, and are set to reap the rewards.\" Fred Thomas of AllMusic wrote, \"Though not quite as boisterous and immediate as their debut and nowhere as stylistically restless as Sounds from Nowheresville, the songs here slowly sink in and last a lot longer than anything else the band has done prior\", yet concluded that \"the maturation on Super Critical takes them out of the 'overbearing pop flash in the pan' category and suggests they may have even more interesting statements ahead of them.\" Ed Potton of The Times found Super Critical to be \"breezier and more coherent [than Sounds from Nowheresville], sticking mainly to the kind of insouciant disco-funk-pop that [The Ting Tings] do so well.\" Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu viewed the album as \"a short and rather sweet effort that might not launch them to the top of the charts once again, but at least confirms us they're not yet ready to fade into obscurity\", while commending The Ting Tings for \"creating a consistent record that not only manages to mend the damage done by its faulty predecessor, but also create a coherent, fun atmosphere.\" Virgin Media's Matthew Horton felt that \"what Super Critical misses is one really great tune. The closest it comes is 'Green Poison's soulful grind, strangely reminiscent of Stock Aitken & Waterman's 'Roadblock', yet no cigar. Otherwise this is just frothy fun, which is fine\u2014but only fine.\" Stephen Dalton of Uncut wrote, \"With echoes of prime-time Chic, Prince and Madonna, the intent is admirable even if too many of the songs feel flimsy and pedestrian\", but described the songs \"Communication\" and \"Failure\" as \"unabashedly gorgeous blasts of sugardipped synth-funk hedonism.\" Despite stating that the album \"actually isn't all that bad, and certainly marks an improvement on its disastrous predecessor, Songs from Nowheresville\", the Shields Gazette commented that \"there's here nothing which leaves any lasting impression.\" Dorian Lynskey of Q magazine noted that Super Critical \"sounds less petulant but no more likely to return [the duo] to the Top 10\", adding that it \"would be a solid album for someone like Annie, For The Ting Tings, though, it suggests there's no way back from Nowheresville.\" The Observers Killian Fox opined that the duo \"can still write a catchy tune [...] but these songs are all surface, with only the odd hook to snag us.\" Guy Oddy of The Arts Desk panned the album, dubbing it a \"disappointment\" and expressing that \"it's not wholly clear whether the Ting Tings have become cultural commentators, like Negativland without samplers, and Super Critical is a prank about the vacuousness of so much chart pop, or whether they've committed commercial suicide.\""

On their way back to base after the weekend Daffi bumps into a new girl Tehila and, believing that she is her replacement, takes her under her wing. Daffi and Zohar work menial jobs with Daffi being forced to shred paper. After Daffi trains the new girl she goes to her supervisor Rama and explains that after writing letters to everyone she could trying to get a new position in Tel Aviv they have finally sent a replacement. However Tehila is not a replacement at all but has snuck onto the base to see a boy she slept with and fell in love with. After he rejects her she slits her belly and crawls into bed where she is discovered by the other girls in the morning. Daffi is crushed by her death realizing that she will not be replaced after all. However, when she complains to personnel the officer in charge tells her she herself got transferred by applying to be an officer. Daffi then gets a recommendation from Rama and a boy Zohar has a crush on and is transferred away. She and Zohar part on bad terms. Left alone, Zohar is teased by the other girls for being a virgin. Irena, one of her co-workers, advises her to sleep with a boy as soon as possible. Zohar takes this advice to heart and flirts with a visiting soldier she meets while guarding the arms, setting up a date with him for the following night. Returning to her dorm room, she climbs into her bunk bed and it breaks. After she refuses to sleep in the only spare bed, where Tehila was found dead, Irena lets her sleep in her bed and sleeps in Tehila's old bed, where she hallucinates in the middle of the night that Tehila is there with her. The following day Irena behaves bizarrely and the girls begin to believe that there is something wrong with her. Zohar offers to take her to the infirmary but instead prepares for her date with the visiting soldier. However Irena insists on coming on the date and behaves strangely the entire time. When Zohar and her date finally manage to be alone, he aggressively strips off her clothes and when she asks him to be gentle, he tells her she should have gone with a non-combatant. She asks him to stop; he ignores her but is stopped by Irena who pulls his rifle on him and humiliates him before finally letting him go. Once Irena and Zohar return to the office, Rama chastises them for not going to the infirmary. When Zohar explains that she was almost raped and that Irena saved her, Irena claims to have no idea what she's talking about, and Zohar realizes that Tehila's ghost must have left her. Unimpressed, Rama makes Zohar stay in the office all night cleaning. When she returns in the morning she is impressed that the office is spotless but soon finds that Zohar has shredded every record in the department and stuffed them in Rama's office. As a result of destroying all the records, Zohar is sent to military prison, and Rama is discharged despite wanting to stay in the army and become a career officer. Meanwhile, Daffi finally graduates from officer training and instead of being placed in Tel-Aviv, receives Rama's old position. Despite trying to make the best of the situation Daffi finds that Zohar is insubordinate and rude. After she tries to punish Zohar, Zohar photocopies the old letters that Daffi wrote to try to get off base and posts them all around the base. Daffi in turn tries to delete all the computer game records that she and Zohar used to play together. The two get in a violent fight with staple guns and Daffi wins. However, instead of the games, Daffi accidentally deletes all the recently digitized staff records. The two are arrested and when Daffi tries to admit her mistake, Zohar takes the blame for it. She is sentenced to more time in military prison while Daffi is demoted to a cushy office job in Tel Aviv. After she gets out of prison Zohar gives up on Minesweeper and becomes addicted to Freecell. She is transferred to the infirmary where she has sex with the soldier responsible for digitizing the military records, who suffered a nervous breakdown after she deleted them. Her service finally comes to an end, as E-mail replaces paper mail. She leaves the army base, helping Daffi draft another plea."

It quickly outgrew its initial purpose as a bi-weekly listing magazine and ended up having a profound effect on Moscow\u2019s cultural and nightlife scene.  In the next 10 years Afisha turned into a Russia's leading publishing house by launching an array of spin-off publications such as monthly travel magazine Afisha-Mir, alternative weekly Bolshoy Gorod, food magazine Afisha-Yeda and a series of Afisha-branded travel guide books. A team of young journalists, designers and photographers brought together by Oskolkov-Tsentsiper created a unique Afisha style which had a major impact on Russian media. Many high-profile Russian artists made their first public appearances on Afisha'''s front cover and the magazine popularised several new fashion trends \u2013 even introducing numerous new words into the Russian lexicon, from \u201cdeadline\u201d to \u201chipster\u201d. A number of Russia's now prominent cultural figures started their careers writing for Afisha including film directors Avdotya Smirnova, Mikhail Brashinskiy and Roman Volobuev, award-winning writers Lev Danilkin and Yulia Yakovleva and Elena Kovalskaya who went on to become artistic director of Moscow\u2019s Meyerhold Theater.Afisha played an active part in 2011\u20132013 Russian protests with its senior stuff helping to organise rallies in Moscow, publishing manifestos demanding fair election and at some point putting the opposition leader Alexey Navalny on the print edition's cover. In 2014 Afisha's parent company ProfMedia was bought by a Russian state-owned energy corporation Gazprom. Soon after the new owners have shuttered magazine's struggling print edition and fired most of the editorial staff. Plans to relaunch the Afisha as a quarterly were announced but never realized."

In addition there are problems with his small son and beloved woman which does not help with creating masterpieces. The legendary hired killer nicknamed as \"Ghost\" mercilessly shoots up a car with two people inside before his very eyes and helps Prachenko get out of his crisis in an unusual way. The killer becomes his ideological mastermind, brutally and visually revealing to him the harsh truth of life. Now they are inextricably linked with each other. Carried away by the suddenly discovered prospects, the desire to go deeper into the skin of the hired killer, Anton loses all vigilance and the mysterious and cruel \"Ghost\" substitutes him. It turns out that the \"mark\" Anton was amusing himself with was the contract of \"Ghost\". And at the last stage of the scenario the killer murders the \"mark\" for real ... with the help of the same pistol with which Anton learned to shoot. All the evidence points to the writer. Now the police and bandits immediately rush in pursuit of Anton. Having kidnapped the agitated Anton, the \"Ghost\" takes him to some hovel outside the city, chains him up and threatening with reprisals against his relatives forces him to finish the book he started. While the writer is busy with this, the killer \"disposes\" of all witnesses and then goes to kill Anton. \"Ghost\" unfastens the writer and sets the house on fire. Exhausted Anton manages to hit \"Ghost's\" head and runs out into the street. When he runs a distance, the house explodes. All charges have been dropped from Anton. The charred corpse found in the house is buried in a semi-abandoned cemetery somewhere outside the city. After some time, Anton, who became famous and revered thanks to a new book about the \"Ghost\", sees through a window a familiar silhouette at a book signing. In a panic, Anton leaves everything and hurries back to his relatives. Having made sure of their safety, Anton walks with them along the lake shore. One time the killer told Prachenko that it is possible to \"carry out\" any mark. It is more difficult to get away from persecution. After some time when Anton and his family leave, someone comes to the shore of the lake and feeds the birds. There is no doubt that the \"Ghost\" is alive and that the explosion of the house was just a dramatization of death, arranged in the spirit of Machiavelli. From now on, Anton's life will be completely different from the past. He will never forget the words of the killer: \"You are not alone in the street ...\"."

Drones is a concept album following a soldier's abandonment, indoctrination as a \"human drone\", and eventual defection. It also comments on the Obama administration\u2019s drone program. After their previous albums incorporated orchestral and electronic music, Muse aimed to return to a more straightforward rock sound musically. Drones received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its instrumentation but criticised its concept and lyrics. It topped 21 international charts, including the UK Albums Chart (where it became Muse's fifth consecutive number-one album) and the US Billboard 200. It sold over a million copies worldwide in 2015, making it the year's 19th-bestselling album. At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, it won the award for Best Rock Album. The album was listed on 41 in the NME albums of the year 2015. Diffuser.fm named it the 42nd best of the year.

In December 2013, they released the live album and video Live at Rome Olympic Stadium; songwriter Matt Bellamy said the band wanted the release \"to capture some of the extremes of what we've been doing since we want to go in a different direction in the future.\" Muse began writing their seventh album soon after the Rome concert. Bellamy stated that the album \"should be something that really does strip away the additional things that we've experimented with on the last two albums... I kind of feel like it will be nice to reconnect and remind ourselves of just the basics of who we are.\" The band felt the electronic side of their music was becoming too dominant. According to bassist Chris Wolstenholme, some of the music on The 2nd Law was \"somewhat of a bore to play live, and I'm not too certain how much of it worked for our shows ... The logical step was to strip away all the outer layers and go back to the way we started. Sometimes, making things simpler makes them more powerful.\""

After having self-produced their previous two albums, Muse worked with producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange to spend less time mixing and reviewing takes and focus on performance. Tommaso Colliva and Rich Costey served as additional producers. After having used several different bass guitars and effect pedals for The 2nd Law, Wolstenholme used only one bass guitar and a small number of pedals, hoping to find a cohesive sound. The first recording session ended on 19 October, with the band calling it \"emotional\". Muse re-entered the studio in November 2014. On 1 April 2015, drummer Dominic Howard and mixer Rich Costey indicated on their Instagram accounts that they had finished mixing the album.

In March 2015, he said: In an interview in the same month, Bellamy described Drones as \"a modern metaphor for what it is to lose empathy ... through modern technology, and obviously through drone warfare in particular, it's possible to actually do quite horrific things by remote control, at a great distance, without actually feeling any of the consequences, or even feeling responsible in some way.\""

Kerrang! gave Drones a perfect score, calling it \"a claustrophobic classic that sharpens the focus of what is possible in the name of high-minded rock.\" Q wrote that despite Muse's stated goal of returning to their roots, \"Drones is anything but back-to-basics garage rock... befitting of its proggy conceptual narrative about state mind control, it's an album of rambling interests.\" David Fricke of Rolling Stone called the album \"a truly guilty pleasure\" and praised its \"chunky update of the guitar-bass-drums charge\" of the band's earlier albums as \"what Muse do best.\" The NME wrote that the album's \"trademark Muse themes of brainwashing, warmongering superpowers, suppression of The Truth and the urgent need to fight the hand that bleeds us still resonate in 2015, but obliquely ... Muse's music once more matches [Bellamy's] adventurous intrigue.\" AllMusic wrote that \"it's hard to avoid [Muse's] conclusion that war is bad, but this inclination to write everything in bold, italicized capital letters is an asset when it comes to music.\" Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote that despite the \"trite\" lyrics and \"confusing\" plot, some of Drones was \"fist-pumpingly ace; a timely restatement of the need for popular music to evoke both thought and dopamine rush.\" Ian Cohen of Pitchfork found that Drones lacked subtlety and criticised its lyrics, writing, \"Whatever pleasure can be generated from Bellamy's admirable melodic sense and overblown hooks is negated by Muse's insistence that they're profound rather than fun.\" Oliver Keens of Time Out London called the album's handling of the drones subject matter \"tactless and crass\" and its story \"as dull as dog food \u2013 told with the wishy-washy flim-flam of a frothing conspiracy theorist ... We used to moan that musicians didn't write about politics anymore. Based on this effort, maybe that's for the best.\" Rolling Stone named it the 38th best album of 2015, calling it a \"searing commentary on our era's vague dread, computer-driven death from above and Orwellian political climate ... It was the year's most convincing howl from the abyss.\". The Daily Telegraph wrote that \"It's more than a little Spinal Tap, but if I was a teenage boy this is exactly the kind of thrilling madness that might turn me on to a moribund genre.\" The Evening Standard gave it four out of five and wrote: \"Prog phobics might dismiss it as latter-day Pink Floyd with a dash of Noam Chomsky.

After returning from her year-long hiatus from music, lead vocalist Florence Welch returned to configure How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, recording material that dealt with personal conflicts and struggles. In comparison to their last two studio albums, the album is much more refined and stripped-down instrumentally, and incorporates a mixture of musical influences such as folk, blues and gospel. How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful was met with positive reviews from music critics, who commended the album for its cohesion, production and Welch's vocal delivery. Additionally, it appeared on several year-end critics' lists. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with 68,788 copies sold in its first week, becoming the band's third consecutive number-one album. Four singles were released from the album, \"What Kind of Man\", \"Ship to Wreck\", \"Queen of Peace\" and \"Delilah\". The album earned the band five Grammy Award nominations, in addition to being shortlisted for the 2015 Mercury Prize."

The album included the song \"Spectrum (Say My Name)\", which was remixed by Scottish musician Calvin Harris and became the group's first number-one single on the UK Singles Chart in July 2012. In late August 2012, the band's lead vocalist Florence Welch revealed to Style.com that she would take a year-long hiatus from music, explaining, \"There's a big 'take a year off' plan. The record company have put no pressure on me for the next album. They've said I can have as long as I want\". During her break, Welch made a guest appearance on Calvin Harris's album 18 Months, providing vocals on the song \"Sweet Nothing\", which topped the UK chart."

        "content": "In an interview with Zane Lowe on 16 February 2015, Welch said that during the year off she had \"a bit of a nervous breakdown\", and that time was chaotic. The hiatus was somewhat new for the singer, who was almost constantly at work during the making of the band's first two albums. Welch explained further, saying, \"I was still going out and going to events but something wasn't quite right, I was spiraling a bit. I wasn't making myself happy. I wasn't stable.\" It allowed Welch to reassess her musical approach to reflect her own life experiences, a change she credits to consulting with Taylor Swift. Overall, the recording sessions for How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful were conducted during a vulnerable period in Welch's life, making the album her most personal work thus far. Welch began composing the material for How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful upon concluding the band's touring in support of Ceremonials, in 2014. Regarding the album's themes, she said in a press statement, \"I guess although I've always dealt in fantasy and metaphor when I came to writing, that meant the songs this time were dealing much more in reality. Ceremonials was so fixated on death and water, and the idea of escape or transcendence through death, but the new album became about trying to learn how to live, and how to love in the world rather than trying to escape from it. Which is frightening because I'm not hiding behind anything but it felt like something I had to do.\" Welch also told Lowe that producer Markus Dravs was instrumental in exploring her lyrical versatility, as he disallowed her to write any more songs about water, a main theme in Welch's past compositions. Still, she managed to pen \"Ship to Wreck\", a song Welch jokingly commented was \"not too explicit\" in comparison to her past works. On 4 June 2014, Welch told NME that the band's third studio album was in the works. There was an emphasized effort to avoid heavily orchestrating the instrumental arrangements, or as Welch described it, \"make Ceremonials Part Two\", as she believed the predecessor had reached its creative peak. Welch said that she wanted to work with Dravs on the album, as he produced Bj\u00f6rk's Homogenic (1997), an important album to Welch. \"I felt he had that balance of organic and electronic capabilities, managing those two worlds. And, you know, he's good with big sounds. And I like big sounds. And he's good with trumpets, and I knew I wanted a brass section on this record\", she said in the press release. \"With Markus, I wanted to make something that was big but that had a gentleness to it, that had a warmth, that was rooted. I think that's why we went back more to the live instruments. Something that was band-led almost\", she added. The final track on the album, \"Mother\", was co-produced by Dravs and Paul Epworth."

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, based on 31 reviews. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly viewed How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful as \"Florence + the Machine's most raw and stripped-down album to date\", adding that \"Welch may have gone slightly smaller with her sound, but her emotional depth and capacity for wonder remain gigantic.\" Michael Madden of Consequence of Sound hailed it as \"the strongest Florence album to date\" due to Welch having \"reached a new level of eloquence in her writing, making her a more complete artist than ever\", concluding that \"it's apparent she's among her generation's most deserving superstars, maintaining a stunning balance of technical mastery and sensitive lyricism.\" Leonie Cooper of NME wrote, \"Overflowing with stately songwriting and lyrical craftsmanship, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful makes for a restrained but joyful return, and a collection that will last long after Welch's broken bones are mended.\" Carl Wilson of Billboard commented, \"No matter the mood and tempo, though, the Florence & The Machine heard on How Big How Blue How Beautiful is a newly self-aware one. It shows a different kind of mastery by allowing for a different kind of vulnerability, an especially delicate balancing act for a young woman in pop music.\" Q hailed the band's thematic development, noting a \"more righteous indignation\" in the album's lyrics. In a four out of five star review, Nydailynews observed that \"The songs have a canny way of avoiding genre cliches\" and artistically, Welch \"draws more from the new wave of Siouxsie and the Banshees or the pan-pop breadth of Annie Lennox\u2019s solo career\". Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph praised the album as \"thunderous\" and stated that Welch \"has turned her turmoil into a powerful record, adding a new spiritual depth and mature awareness to the thrill of the wild emotions she has always been able to pump so fearlessly out of her mighty heart and lungs.\" Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork described the album as \"a huge, sturdy record, built for arenas [...] and it's richly and carefully enough constructed to endure the extensive exposure Welch's heartache is going to get over the course of this summer.\" Will Hermes of Rolling Stone opined that \"Welch isn't the most rhythmic singer; she's more about powerful held notes and dramatic articulation, and her rock moves have sometimes felt fussy in the past. But here, she punches like a prizefighter.\" James Christopher Monger of AllMusic expressed that Welch's \"Brit-pop soul treacle is still miles better than some of her contemporaries' top-tier offerings, and when the album connects it moves right in and starts to redecorate, but when it falters, it's akin to a chatty party guest failing to realize that everyone else has gone home.\" In a less enthusiastic review, Andrew Unterberger of Spin dubbed the album \"an exceedingly coherent listen, both in terms of consistent production and lyrical themes [...] But it's not a great album, and that's because the production and dynamics are so compressed to soupy church-soul consistency that once you get into the thick of the LP, it's virtually impossible to keep your attention rapt throughout.\" Alexis Petridis of The Guardian felt that the album is \"too overblown and daft for the songs to have the desired emotional impact: it's never really intimate enough for the feelings Welch expresses to connect.\""

        "content": "Ozon developed its own fulfillment infrastructure to deliver orders in Russia's 11 time zones. In 2018 the company had seven fulfillment centers in the Moscow region as well as St. Petersburg, Tver, Kazan, Ekaterinburg, Rostov-On-Don and Novosibirsk. It more than doubled its fulfilment capacity in 2019 to almost 200,000 sqm, as well as investing in its last-mile delivery infrastructure. The company operates its own delivery logistics platform and has a network of over 16,000 pickup points, including automated parcel lockers across Russia, . The use of brick-and-mortar pickup points where customers can pick up their orders arose out of a lack of reliable third-party delivery services in many parts of Russia. In 2019, Ozon launched an express grocery delivery service in Moscow, and rolled out its contactless home delivery service, which became a popular option during the coronavirus pandemic in the spring of 2020. In March 2020, Ozon announced plans to spend more than $300 million to expand its logistics in advance of a potential IPO. In October 2021, \u201cOzon Express\u201d brand launched in Moscow inhouse ready-to-serve food production with one hour delivery with up to 30 dishes by the end of 2021. \u201cOzon Express\u201d culinary production is expected to be available in other regions of Russia.
