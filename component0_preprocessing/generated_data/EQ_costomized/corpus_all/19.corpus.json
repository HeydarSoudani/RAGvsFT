        "content": "Adam Smith  (baptized  1723 \u2013 17 July 1790) was a Scottish economist and philosopher who was a pioneer of political economy and key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment. Also known as \"The Father of Economics\" or \"The Father of Capitalism\", he wrote two classic works, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. In his work, Smith introduced his theory of absolute advantage. Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day. Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by writers such as Horace Walpole."

        "content": "Smith was born in Kirkcaldy, in Fife, Scotland. His father, also Adam Smith, was a Scottish Writer to the Signet (senior solicitor), advocate and prosecutor (judge advocate) and also served as comptroller of the customs in Kirkcaldy. Smith's mother was born Margaret Douglas, daughter of the landed Robert Douglas of Strathendry, also in Fife; she married Smith's father in 1720. Two months before Smith was born, his father died, leaving his mother a widow. The date of Smith's baptism into the Church of Scotland at Kirkcaldy was 5 June 1723 and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth, which is unknown. Although few events in Smith's early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist John Rae, Smith's biographer, recorded that Smith was abducted by Romani at the age of three and released when others went to rescue him. Smith was close to his mother, who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions. He attended the Burgh School of Kirkcaldy\u2014characterised by Rae as \"one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period\"\u2014from 1729 to 1737, he learned Latin, mathematics, history, and writing."

        "content": "Smith entered the University of Glasgow when he was 14 and studied moral philosophy under Francis Hutcheson. Here he developed his passion for liberty, reason, and free speech. In 1740, he was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at Balliol College, Oxford, under the Snell Exhibition. Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling. In Book V, Chapter II of The Wealth of Nations, he wrote: \"In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching.\" Smith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of David Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature, and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it. According to William Robert Scott, \"The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework.\" Nevertheless, he took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large Bodleian Library. When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters. Near the end of his time there, he began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown. He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended. In Book V of The Wealth of Nations, Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at English universities, when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished men of letters could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the Church of England. Smith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson, who was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy, but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, his magnetic personality and method of lecturing so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as \"the never to be forgotten Hutcheson\"\u2014a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson."

        "content": "Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 at the University of Edinburgh, sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of Lord Kames. His lecture topics included rhetoric and belles-lettres, and later the subject of \"the progress of opulence\". On this latter topic, he first expounded his economic philosophy of \"the obvious and simple system of natural liberty\". While Smith was not adept at public speaking, his lectures met with success. In 1750, Smith met the philosopher David Hume, who was his senior by more than a decade. In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment. In 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching logic courses, and in 1752, he was elected a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, having been introduced to the society by Lord Kames. When the head of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow died the next year, Smith took over the position. He worked as an academic for the next 13 years, which he characterised as \"by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]\". Smith published The Theory of Moral Sentiments in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined \"mutual sympathy\" as the basis of moral sentiments. He based his explanation, not on a special \"moral sense\" as the Third Lord Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had done, nor on utility as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the 20th-century concept of empathy, the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being. Following the publication of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith. After the publication of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith began to give more attention to jurisprudence and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals. For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for mercantilism, the economic theory that dominated Western European economic policies at the time. In 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.). At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from Charles Townshend\u2014who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume\u2014to tutor his stepson, Henry Scott, the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith resigned from his professorship in 1764 to take the tutoring position. He subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he had resigned partway through the term, but his students refused."

        "title": "Adam Smith_Tutoring and travels",
        "content": "Smith's tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott, during which time he educated Scott on a variety of subjects, such as etiquette and manners. He was paid \u00a3300 per year (plus expenses) along with a \u00a3300 per year pension; roughly twice his former income as a teacher. Smith first travelled as a tutor to Toulouse, France, where he stayed for a year and a half. According to his own account, he found Toulouse to be somewhat boring, having written to Hume that he \"had begun to write a book to pass away the time\". After touring the south of France, the group moved to Geneva, where Smith met with the philosopher Voltaire. From Geneva, the party moved to Paris. Here, Smith met Benjamin Franklin, and discovered the Physiocracy school founded by Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay. Physiocrats were opposed to mercantilism, the dominating economic theory of the time, illustrated in their motto Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui m\u00eame! (Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!). The wealth of France had been virtually depleted by Louis\u00a0XIV and Louis\u00a0XV in ruinous wars, and was further exhausted in aiding the American insurgents against the British. The excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution was considered a source of unproductive labour, with France's agriculture the only economic sector maintaining the wealth of the nation. Given that the British economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in France, Smith concluded that \"with all its imperfections, [the Physiocratic school] is perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy.\" The distinction between productive versus unproductive labour\u2014the physiocratic classe steril\u2014was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory."

Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and he devoted much of the next decade to writing his magnum opus. There, he befriended Henry Moyes, a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude. Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and Thomas Reid in the young man's education. In May 1773, Smith was elected fellow of the Royal Society of London, and was elected a member of the Literary Club in 1775. The Wealth of Nations was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months. In 1778, Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother (who died in 1784) in Panmure House in Edinburgh's Canongate. Five years later, as a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received its royal charter, he automatically became one of the founding members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. From 1787 to 1789, he occupied the honorary position of Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow."

        "content": "Smith died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness. His body was buried in the Canongate Kirkyard. On his deathbed, Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more. Smith's literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist Joseph Black and the pioneering geologist James Hutton. Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication. He mentioned an early unpublished History of Astronomy as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as Essays on Philosophical Subjects. Smith's library went by his will to David Douglas, Lord Reston (son of his cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Smith. It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs.\u00a0Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs.\u00a0Bannerman). On the death in 1878 of her husband, the Reverend W.\u00a0B. Cunningham of Prestonpans, Mrs.\u00a0Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor Robert Oliver Cunningham of Queen's College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queen's College. After his death, the remaining books were sold. On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879, her portion of the library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church) in Edinburgh and the collection was transferred to the University of Edinburgh Main Library in 1972."

        "content": "Not much is known about Smith's personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles. His personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request. He never married, and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother, with whom he lived after his return from France and who died six years before him. Smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of \"inexpressible benignity\". He was known to talk to himself, a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions. He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness, and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study. According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a tanning factory, and while discussing free trade, Smith walked into a huge tanning pit from which he needed help to escape. He is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up  outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality. James Boswell, who was a student of Smith's at Glasgow University, and later knew him at the Literary Club, says that Smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books, so his conversation was unimpressive. According to Boswell, he once told Sir Joshua Reynolds, that \"he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood\". Smith has been alternatively described as someone who \"had a large nose, bulging eyes, a protruding lower lip, a nervous twitch, and a speech impediment\" and one whose \"countenance was manly and agreeable\". Smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point, saying, \"I am a beau in nothing but my books.\" Smith rarely sat for portraits, so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory. The best-known portraits of Smith are the profile by James Tassie and two etchings by John Kay. The line engravings produced for the covers of 19th-century reprints of The Wealth of Nations were based largely on Tassie's medallion."

        "content": "Considerable scholarly debate has occurred about the nature of Smith's religious views. Smith's father had shown a strong interest in Christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the Church of Scotland. The fact that Adam Smith received the Snell Exhibition suggests that he may have gone to Oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the Church of England. Anglo-American economist Ronald Coase has challenged the view that Smith was a deist, based on the fact that Smith's writings never explicitly invoke God as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds. According to Coase, though Smith does sometimes refer to the \"Great Architect of the Universe\", later scholars such as Jacob Viner have \"very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God\", a belief for which Coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the Wealth of Nations in which Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the \"great phenomena of nature\", such as \"the generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals\", has led men to \"enquire into their causes\", and that \"superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them, from more familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods\". Some other authors argue that Smith's social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of God's action in nature. Smith was also a close friend of David Hume, who was commonly characterised in his own time as an atheist. The publication in 1777 of Smith's letter to William Strahan, in which he described Hume's courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity, attracted considerable controversy."

        "content": "In 1759, Smith published his first work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, sold by co-publishers Andrew Millar of London and Alexander Kincaid of Edinburgh. Smith continued making extensive revisions to the book until his death. Although The Wealth of Nations is widely regarded as Smith's most influential work, Smith himself is believed to have considered The Theory of Moral Sentiments to be a superior work. In the work, Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time, and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek \"mutual sympathy of sentiments.\" His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgment, given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgments they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behaviour. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgment creates an incentive to achieve \"mutual sympathy of sentiments\" with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience. Some scholars have perceived a conflict between The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest. In recent years, however, some scholars of Smith's work have argued that no contradiction exists. They claim that in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the \"impartial spectator\" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments. Rather than viewing The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. Otteson argues that both books are Newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar \"market model\" for explaining the creation and development of large-scale human social orders, including morality, economics, as well as language. Ekelund and Hebert offer a differing view, observing that self-interest is present in both works and that \"in the former, sympathy is the moral faculty that holds self-interest in check, whereas in the latter, competition is the economic faculty that restrains self-interest.\""

        "content": "Disagreement exists between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of Smith's most influential work: An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). Neoclassical economists emphasise Smith's invisible hand, a concept mentioned in the middle of his work \u2013 Book\u00a0IV, Chapter\u00a0II \u2013 and classical economists believe that Smith stated his programme for promoting the \"wealth of nations\" in the first sentences, which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour. Smith used the term \"the invisible hand\" in \"History of Astronomy\" referring to \"the invisible hand of Jupiter\", and once in each of his The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and The Wealth of Nations (1776). This last statement about \"an invisible hand\" has been interpreted in numerous ways. As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it. Those who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum: It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.However, in The Theory of Moral Sentiments he had a more sceptical approach to self-interest as driver of behaviour:How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it. Smith's statement about the benefits of \"an invisible hand\" may be meant to answer Mandeville's contention that \"Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits\". It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their \"conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices\". Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or monopolies, fixing the highest price \"which can be squeezed out of the buyers\". Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants \"in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.\" Thus Smith's chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society: It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (The Wealth of Nations, I.i.10) The neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about \"an invisible hand\" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of neoclassical economics and its concept of general equilibrium; Samuelson's \"Economics\" refers six times to Smith's \"invisible hand\". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson quotes Smith's \"invisible hand\" statement substituting \"general interest\" for \"public interest\". Samuelson concludes: \"Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market.\" Very differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote \"The Wealth of Nations\". Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay, whose ideas Smith was so impressed by that he might have dedicated The Wealth of Nations to him had he not died beforehand. To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the division of labour. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living\u2014\"general plenty\" and \"universal opulence\"\u2014for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith's central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures \"The Wealth of Nations\". Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the \"Wealth of Nations\" summarise this policy: The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances; first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and, secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added]. However, Smith added that the \"abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter.\""

        "content": "The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by Tory writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests. In 2005, The Wealth of Nations was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time. In light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the Industrial Revolution, Britain embraced free trade and Smith's laissez-faire economics, and via the British Empire, used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier-free domestic and international trade. George Stigler attributes to Smith \"the most important substantive proposition in all of economics\". It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in equilibrium for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment. Paul Samuelson finds in Smith's pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages, rents, and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the general equilibrium modelling of Walras a century later. Smith's allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with Malthus, Ricardo, and Karl Marx in their propounding a rigid subsistence\u2013wage theory of labour supply. Joseph Schumpeter criticised Smith for a lack of technical rigour, yet he argued that this enabled Smith's writings to appeal to wider audiences: \"His very limitation made for success. Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along.\" Classical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the \"labour theory of value\". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of Karl Marx's major work, Das Kapital, was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital. The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of neoclassical economics, that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing. The body of theory later termed \"neoclassical economics\" or \"marginalism\" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term \"economics\" was popularised by such neoclassical economists as Alfred Marshall as a concise synonym for \"economic science\" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term \"political economy\" used by Smith. This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences. Neoclassical economics systematised supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the labour theory of value of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side. The bicentennial anniversary of the publication of The Wealth of Nations was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for The Theory of Moral Sentiments and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments, and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His homo economicus or \"economic man\" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in \"The Secret History of the Dismal Science\" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The \"Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics\", Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher, and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense. Smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government: Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all."

        "content": "Smith's chapter on colonies, in turn, would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-19th century onward. The Wealth of Nations would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade. Smith's most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate Richard Cobden, preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the Anti-Corn Law League in overturning the Corn Laws in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire \"on the cheap\" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as Cobdenism or the Manchester School. By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith's second proposal such as Joseph Shield Nicholson would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation. As Marc-William Palen notes: \"On the one hand, Adam Smith's late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire 'on the cheap'. On the other, various proponents of imperial federation throughout the British World sought to use Smith's theories to overturn the predominant Cobdenite hands-off imperial approach and instead, with a firm grip, bring the empire closer than ever before.\" Smith's ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the British Empire."

        "title": "Adam Smith_As a symbol of free-market economics",
        "content": "Smith has been celebrated by advocates of free-market policies as the founder of free-market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the Adam Smith Institute in London, multiple entities known as the \"Adam Smith Society\", including an historical Italian organization, and the U.S.-based Adam Smith Society, and the Australian Adam Smith Club, and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie. Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan argues that, while Smith did not coin the term laissez-faire, \"it was left to Adam Smith to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions\". Greenspan continues that The Wealth of Nations was \"one of the great achievements in human intellectual history\". P.J. O'Rourke describes Smith as the \"founder of free market economics\". Other writers have argued that Smith's support for laissez-faire (which in French means leave alone) has been overstated. Herbert Stein wrote that the people who \"wear an Adam Smith necktie\" do it to \"make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government\", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith \"was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie.\" In Stein's reading, The Wealth of Nations could justify the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and \"discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior\". Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in The Economic Journal that in the 20th-century United States, Reaganomics supporters, The Wall Street Journal, and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an \"extreme dogmatic defender of laissez-faire capitalism and supply-side economics\". In fact, The Wealth of Nations includes the following statement on the payment of taxes: The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. Some commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them luxury-goods taxes and tax on rent. Yet Smith argued for the \"impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation\". Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting \"justice\" and \"certain publick institutions\" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise. Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods \"of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual\" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: \"Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves ... are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state\" (Wealth of Nations, V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because \"we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a doge\". In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial: The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods. However, he added that in general, a retaliatory tariff \"seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them\". Economic historians such as Jacob Viner regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called \"natural liberty\"), but not as a dogmatic supporter of laissez-faire. Economist Daniel Klein believes using the term \"free-market economics\" or \"free-market economist\" to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith's economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the \"Smithian\" identity. Economist David Ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith's thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free-market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood, it would be unwilling to surrender the government help. Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence. Some have also claimed, Emma Rothschild among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage, although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote: The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (The Wealth of Nations, Book 1, Chapter 8) However, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power: A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate."

He was one of the first to state and rigorously prove theorems of calculus, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra of earlier authors. He almost singlehandedly founded complex analysis and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra. A profound mathematician, Cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors; Hans Freudenthal stated: \"More concepts and theorems have been named for Cauchy than for any other mathematician (in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy).\" Cauchy was a prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks on a variety of topics in the fields of mathematics and mathematical physics."

        "content": "Cauchy was the son of Louis Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy (1760\u20131848) and Marie-Madeleine Desestre. Cauchy had two brothers: Alexandre Laurent Cauchy (1792\u20131857), who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847 and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849, and Eugene Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy (1802\u20131877), a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works. Cauchy married Aloise de Bure in 1818.  She was a close relative of the publisher who published most of Cauchy's works. They had two daughters, Marie Fran\u00e7oise Alicia (1819) and Marie Mathilde (1823). Cauchy's father was a high official in the Parisian Police of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, but lost this position due to the French Revolution (July 14, 1789), which broke out one month before Augustin-Louis was born. The Cauchy family survived the revolution and the following Reign of Terror (1793\u201394) by escaping to Arcueil, where Cauchy received his first education, from his father. After the execution of Robespierre (1794), it was safe for the family to return to Paris. There Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy found himself a new bureaucratic job in 1800, and quickly moved up the ranks. When Napoleon Bonaparte came to power (1799), Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy was further promoted, and became Secretary-General of the Senate, working directly under Laplace (who is now better known for his work on mathematical physics). The famous mathematician Lagrange was also a friend of the Cauchy family. On Lagrange's advice, Augustin-Louis was enrolled in the \u00c9cole Centrale du Panth\u00e9on, the best secondary school of Paris at that time, in the fall of 1802. Most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages; the young and ambitious Cauchy, being a brilliant student, won many prizes in Latin and the humanities. In spite of these successes, Augustin-Louis chose an engineering career, and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. In 1805, he placed second of 293 applicants on this exam and was admitted. One of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers a high-level scientific and mathematical education. The school functioned under military discipline, which caused the young and pious Cauchy some problems in adapting. Nevertheless, he finished the Polytechnique in 1807, at the age of 18, and went on to the \u00c9cole des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es (School for Bridges and Roads). He graduated in civil engineering, with the highest honors."

        "content": "After finishing school in 1810, Cauchy accepted a job as a junior engineer in Cherbourg, where Napoleon intended to build a naval base. Here Augustin-Louis stayed for three years, and was assigned the Ourcq Canal project and the Saint-Cloud Bridge project, and worked at the Harbor of Cherbourg. Although he had an extremely busy managerial job, he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts, which he submitted to the Premi\u00e8re Classe (First Class) of the Institut de France. Cauchy's first two manuscripts (on polyhedra) were accepted; the third one (on directrices of conic sections) was rejected. In September 1812, now 23 years old, Cauchy returned to Paris after becoming ill from overwork. Another reason for his return to the capital was that he was losing his interest in his engineering job, being more and more attracted to the abstract beauty of mathematics; in Paris, he would have a much better chance to find a mathematics related position. Therefore, when his health improved in 1813, Cauchy chose to not return to Cherbourg. Although he formally kept his engineering position, he was transferred from the payroll of the Ministry of the Marine to the Ministry of the Interior. The next three years Augustin-Louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave, and spent his time quite fruitfully, working on mathematics (on the related topics of symmetric functions, the symmetric group and the theory of higher-order algebraic equations). He attempted admission to the First Class of the Institut de France but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815. In 1815 Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo, and the newly installed Bourbon king Louis XVIII took the restoration in hand. The Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences was re-established in March 1816; Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge were removed from this Academy for political reasons, and the king appointed Cauchy to take the place of one of them. The reaction of Cauchy's peers was harsh; they considered the acceptance of his membership in the Academy an outrage, and Cauchy thereby created many enemies in scientific circles."

Cauchy was by then a rising mathematical star, who certainly merited a professorship. One of his great successes at that time was the proof of Fermat's polygonal number theorem. However, the fact that Cauchy was known to be very loyal to the Bourbons doubtless also helped him in becoming the successor of Poinsot. He finally quit his engineering job, and received a one-year contract for teaching mathematics to second-year students of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. In 1816, this Bonapartist, non-religious school was reorganized, and several liberal professors were fired; the reactionary Cauchy was promoted to full professor. When Cauchy was 28 years old, he was still living with his parents. His father found it high time for his son to marry; he found him a suitable bride, Alo\u00efse de Bure, five years his junior. The de Bure family were printers and booksellers, and published most of Cauchy's works. Alo\u00efse and Augustin were married on April 4, 1818, with great Roman Catholic pomp and ceremony, in the Church of Saint-Sulpice. In 1819 the couple's first daughter, Marie Fran\u00e7oise Alicia, was born, and in 1823 the second and last daughter, Marie Mathilde. The conservative political climate that lasted until 1830 suited Cauchy perfectly. In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by his even more reactionary brother Charles X. During these years Cauchy was highly productive, and published one important mathematical treatise after another. He received cross-appointments at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, and the ."

        "content": "In July 1830, the July Revolution occurred in France. Charles X fled the country, and was succeeded by the non-Bourbon king Louis-Philippe (of the House of Orl\u00e9ans). Riots, in which uniformed students of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique took an active part, raged close to Cauchy's home in Paris. These events marked a turning point in Cauchy's life, and a break in his mathematical productivity. Cauchy, shaken by the fall of the government, and moved by a deep hatred of the liberals who were taking power, left Paris to go abroad, leaving his family behind. He spent a short time at Fribourg in Switzerland, where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of allegiance to the new regime. He refused to do this, and consequently lost all his positions in Paris, except his membership of the Academy, for which an oath was not required. In 1831 Cauchy went to the Italian city of Turin, and after some time there, he accepted an offer from the King of Sardinia (who ruled Turin and the surrounding Piedmont region) for a chair of theoretical physics, which was created especially for him. He taught in Turin during 1832\u20131833. In 1831, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the following year a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In August 1833 Cauchy left Turin for Prague, to become the science tutor of the thirteen-year-old Duke of Bordeaux Henri d'Artois (1820\u20131883), the exiled Crown Prince and grandson of Charles X. As a professor of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Cauchy had been a notoriously bad lecturer, assuming levels of understanding that only a few of his best students could reach, and cramming his allotted time with too much material. The young Duke had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science, so student and teacher were a perfect mismatch. Although Cauchy took his mission very seriously, he did this with great clumsiness, and with surprising lack of authority over the Duke. During his civil engineering days, Cauchy once had been briefly in charge of repairing a few of the Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of mentioning this to his pupil; with great malice, the young Duke went about saying Mister Cauchy started his career in the sewers of Paris. His role as tutor lasted until the Duke became eighteen years old, in September 1838. Cauchy did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics. The only good that came out of this episode was Cauchy's promotion to baron, a title by which Cauchy set great store. In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and Cauchy was finally reunited with his family after four years in exile."

        "content": "Cauchy returned to Paris and his position at the Academy of Sciences late in 1838. He could not regain his teaching positions, because he still refused to swear an oath of allegiance. In August 1839 a vacancy appeared in the Bureau des Longitudes. This Bureau bore some resemblance to the Academy; for instance, it had the right to co-opt its members. Further, it was believed that members of the Bureau could \"forget about\" the oath of allegiance, although formally, unlike the Academicians, they were obliged to take it. The Bureau des Longitudes was an organization founded in 1795 to solve the problem of determining position at sea \u2014 mainly the longitudinal coordinate, since latitude is easily determined from the position of the sun. Since it was thought that position at sea was best determined by astronomical observations, the Bureau had developed into an organization resembling an academy of astronomical sciences. In November 1839 Cauchy was elected to the Bureau, and discovered immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with. Without his oath, the king refused to approve his election. For four years Cauchy was in the position of being elected but not approved; accordingly, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers. Still Cauchy refused to take any oaths; however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to celestial mechanics. In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy. He also described and illustrated the signed-digit representation of numbers, an innovation presented in England in 1727 by John Colson. The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when Cauchy was finally replaced by Poinsot. Throughout the nineteenth century the French educational system struggled over the separation of church and state. After losing control of the public education system, the Catholic Church sought to establish its own branch of education and found in Cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally. He lent his prestige and knowledge to the \u00c9cole Normale \u00c9ccl\u00e9siastique, a school in Paris run by Jesuits, for training teachers for their colleges. He also took part in the founding of the Institut Catholique. The purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of Catholic university education in France. These activities did not make Cauchy popular with his colleagues, who, on the whole, supported the Enlightenment ideals of the French Revolution. When a chair of mathematics became vacant at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1843, Cauchy applied for it, but received just three of 45 votes. The year 1848 was the year of revolution all over Europe; revolutions broke out in numerous countries, beginning in France. King Louis-Philippe, fearful of sharing the fate of Louis XVI, fled to England. The oath of allegiance was abolished, and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for Cauchy. On March 1, 1849, he was reinstated at the Facult\u00e9 de Sciences, as a professor of mathematical astronomy. After political turmoil all through 1848, France chose to become a Republic, under the Presidency of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, and son of Napoleon's brother, who had been installed as the first king of Holland. Soon (early 1852) the President made himself Emperor of France, and took the name Napoleon III. Not unexpectedly, the idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be useful to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, including university professors. This time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath. Cauchy remained a professor at the university until his death at the age of 67. He received the Last Rites and died of a bronchial condition at 4\u00a0a.m. on 23 May 1857. His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower."

        "content": "Cauchy is most famous for his single-handed development of complex function theory. The first pivotal theorem proved by Cauchy, now known as Cauchy's integral theorem, was the following: where f(z) is a complex-valued function holomorphic on and within the non-self-intersecting closed curve C (contour) lying in the complex plane. The contour integral is taken along the contour C. The rudiments of this theorem can already be found in a paper that the 24-year-old Cauchy presented to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (then still called \"First Class of the Institute\") on August 11, 1814. In full form the theorem was given in 1825. The 1825 paper is seen by many as Cauchy's most important contribution to mathematics. In 1826 Cauchy gave a formal definition of a residue of a function. This concept concerns functions that have poles\u2014isolated singularities, i.e., points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity. If the complex-valued function f(z) can be expanded in the neighborhood  of a singularity a as where \u03c6(z) is analytic (i.e., well-behaved without singularities), then f is said to have a pole of order n in the point a. If n = 1, the pole is called simple. The coefficient B1 is called by Cauchy the residue of function f at a. If f is non-singular at a then the residue of f is zero at a. Clearly the residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to, where we replaced B1 by the modern notation of the residue. In 1831, while in Turin, Cauchy submitted two papers to the Academy of Sciences of Turin. In the first he proposed the formula now known as Cauchy's integral formula, where f(z) is analytic on C and within the region bounded by the contour C and the complex number a is somewhere in this region. The contour integral is taken counter-clockwise. Clearly, the integrand has a simple pole at z = a. In the second paper he presented the residue theorem, where the sum is over all the n poles of f(z) on and within the contour C. These results of Cauchy's still form the core of complex function theory as it is taught today to physicists and electrical engineers. For quite some time, contemporaries of Cauchy ignored his theory, believing it to be too complicated. Only in the 1840s the theory started to get response, with Pierre Alphonse Laurent being the first mathematician, besides Cauchy, making a substantial contribution (his Laurent series published in 1843)."

        "content": "In his book Cours d'Analyse Cauchy stressed the importance of rigor in analysis. Rigor in this case meant the rejection of the principle of Generality of algebra (of earlier authors such as Euler and Lagrange) and its replacement by geometry and infinitesimals. Judith Grabiner wrote Cauchy was \"the man who taught rigorous analysis to all of Europe\".  The book is frequently noted as being the first place that inequalities, and  arguments were introduced into Calculus.  Here Cauchy defined continuity as follows: The function f(x) is continuous with respect to x between the given limits if, between these limits, an infinitely small increment in the variable always produces an infinitely small increment in the function itself. M. Barany claims that the \u00c9cole mandated the inclusion of infinitesimal methods against Cauchy's better judgement.  Gilain notes that when the portion of the curriculum devoted to Analyse Alg\u00e9brique was reduced in 1825, Cauchy insisted on placing the topic of continuous functions (and therefore also infinitesimals) at the beginning of the Differential Calculus. Laugwitz (1989) and Benis-Sinaceur (1973) point out that Cauchy continued to use infinitesimals in his own research as late as 1853. Cauchy gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence tending to zero.  There has been a vast body of literature written about Cauchy's notion of \"infinitesimally small quantities\", arguing they lead from everything from the usual \"epsilontic\" definitions or to the notions of non-standard analysis. The consensus is that Cauchy omitted or left implicit the important ideas to make clear the precise meaning of the infinitely small quantities he used."

In this book he gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a limit in the form that is still taught. Also Cauchy's well-known test for absolute convergence stems from this book: Cauchy condensation test. In 1829 he defined for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another textbook. In spite of these, Cauchy's own research papers often used intuitive, not rigorous, methods; thus one of his theorems was exposed to a \"counter-example\" by Abel, later fixed by the introduction of the notion of uniform continuity."

Their life there during that time was apparently hard; Augustin-Louis's father, Louis Fran\u00e7ois, spoke of living on rice, bread, and crackers during the period. A paragraph from an undated letter from Louis Fran\u00e7ois to his mother in Rouen says: In any event, he inherited his father's staunch royalism and hence refused to take oaths to any government after the overthrow of Charles X. He was an equally staunch Catholic and a member of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. He also had links to the Society of Jesus and defended them at the Academy when it was politically unwise to do so. His zeal for his faith may have led to his caring for Charles Hermite during his illness and leading Hermite to become a faithful Catholic. It also inspired Cauchy to plead on behalf of the Irish during the Great Famine of Ireland. His royalism and religious zeal also made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues. He felt that he was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed. Niels Henrik Abel called him a \"bigoted Catholic\" and added he was \"mad and there is nothing that can be done about him\", but at the same time praised him as a mathematician. Cauchy's views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause. When Libri was accused of stealing books he was replaced by Joseph Liouville rather than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy. Another dispute with political overtones concerned Jean-Marie Constant Duhamel and a claim on inelastic shocks. Cauchy was later shown, by Jean-Victor Poncelet, to be wrong."

        "content": "Friedrich August von Hayek   ( , ; 8 May 189923 March 1992), often referred to by his initials F. A. Hayek, was an Austrian-British economist, and philosopher who is best known for his defence of classical liberalism. Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for their work on money and economic fluctuations, and the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena. His account of how changing prices communicate information that helps individuals coordinate their plans is widely regarded as an important achievement in economics, leading to his prize. Hayek served in World War I during his teenage years and said that this experience in the war and his desire to help avoid the mistakes that had led to the war drew him into economics. At the University of Vienna, he studied economics, eventually receiving his doctoral degrees in law in 1921 and in political science in 1923. He subsequently lived and worked in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany; he became a British subject in 1938. Hayek's academic life was mostly spent at the London School of Economics, and later at the University of Chicago, and the University of Freiburg. Although he is widely considered a leader of the Austrian School of Economics, he also had close connections with the Chicago School of Economics. Hayek was also a major social theorist and political philosopher of the 20th century and as the co-founder of Mont Pelerin Society he contributed to the revival of classical liberalism in the post-war era. His most popular work, The Road to Serfdom, has sold over 2.25\u00a0million copies (as of 2020). Hayek was appointed a Companion of Honour in 1984 for his academic contributions to economics. He was the first recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 from President George H. W. Bush. In 2011, his article \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the American Economic Review during its first 100 years."

        "title": "Friedrich Hayek_Early life",
        "content": "Friedrich August von Hayek was born in Vienna to August von Hayek and Felicitas Hayek (n\u00e9e von Juraschek). His father, born in 1871 also in Vienna, was a medical doctor employed by the municipal ministry of health. August was a part-time botany lecturer at the University of Vienna. Friedrich was the oldest of three brothers, Heinrich (1900\u20131969) and Erich (1904\u20131986), who were one-and-a-half and five years younger than he was. His father's career as a university professor influenced Hayek's goals later in life. Both of his grandfathers, who lived long enough for Hayek to know them, were scholars. Franz von Juraschek was a leading economist in Austria-Hungary and a close friend of Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, one of the founders of the Austrian School of Economics. Hayek's paternal grandfather, Gustav Edler von Hayek, taught natural sciences at the Imperial Realobergymnasium (secondary school) in Vienna. He wrote works in the field of biological systematics, some of which are relatively well known. On his mother's side, Hayek was second cousin to the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. His mother often played with Wittgenstein's sisters and had known him well. As a result of their family relationship, Hayek became one of the first to read Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus when the book was published in its original German edition in 1921. Although he met Wittgenstein on only a few occasions, Hayek said that Wittgenstein's philosophy and methods of analysis had a profound influence on his own life and thought. In his later years, Hayek recalled a discussion of philosophy with Wittgenstein when both were officers during World War I. After Wittgenstein's death, Hayek had intended to write a biography of Wittgenstein and worked on collecting family materials and later assisted biographers of Wittgenstein. He was related to Wittgenstein on the non-Jewish side of the Wittgenstein family. Since his youth, Hayek frequently socialized with Jewish intellectuals and he mentions that people often speculated whether he was also of Jewish ancestry. That made him curious, so he spent some time researching his ancestors and found out that he has no Jewish ancestors within five generations. The surname Hayek uses the German spelling of the Czech surname H\u00e1jek. Hayek traced his ancestry to an ancestor with the surname \u201cHagek\u201d who came from Prague. Hayek displayed an intellectual and academic bent from a very young age and read fluently and frequently before going to school. However, he did quite poorly at school, due to lack of interest and problems with teachers. He was at the bottom of his class in most subjects, and once received three failing grades, in Latin, Greek and mathematics.  He was very interested in theater, even attempting to write some tragedies, and biology, regularly helping his father with his botanical work. At his father's suggestion, as a teenager he read the genetic and evolutionary works of Hugo de Vries and August Weismann and the philosophical works of Ludwig Feuerbach. He noted Goethe as the greatest early intellectual influence.  In school, Hayek was much taken by one instructor's lectures on Aristotle's ethics. In his unpublished autobiographical notes, Hayek recalled a division between him and his younger brothers who were only a few years younger than him, but he believed that they were somehow of a different generation. He preferred to associate with adults. In 1917, Hayek joined an artillery regiment in the Austro-Hungarian Army and fought on the Italian front. Hayek suffered damage to his hearing in his left ear during the war and was decorated for bravery. He also survived the 1918 flu pandemic. Hayek then decided to pursue an academic career, determined to help avoid the mistakes that had led to the war. Hayek said of his experience: \"The decisive influence was really World War I. It's bound to draw your attention to the problems of political organization\". He vowed to work for a better world."

        "content": "At the University of Vienna, Hayek initially studied mostly philosophy, psychology and economics. The University allowed students to choose their subjects freely and there wasn't much obligatory written work, or tests except main exams at the end of the study. By the end of his studies Hayek became more interested in economics, mostly for financial and career reasons; he planned to combine law and economics to start a career in diplomatic service.  He earned doctorates in law and political science in 1921 and 1923 respectively. For a short time, when the University of Vienna closed he studied in Constantin von Monakow's Institute of Brain Anatomy, where Hayek spent much of his time staining brain cells. Hayek's time in Monakow's lab and his deep interest in the work of Ernst Mach inspired his first intellectual project, eventually published as The Sensory Order (1952). It located connective learning at the physical and neurological levels, rejecting the \"sense data\" associationism of the empiricists and logical positivists. Hayek presented his work to the private seminar he had created with Herbert Furth called the Geistkreis. During Hayek's years at the University of Vienna, Carl Menger's work on the explanatory strategy of social science and Friedrich von Wieser's commanding presence in the classroom left a lasting influence on him. Upon the completion of his examinations, Hayek was hired by Ludwig von Mises on the recommendation of Wieser as a specialist for the Austrian government working on the legal and economic details of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Between 1923 and 1924, Hayek worked as a research assistant to Professor Jeremiah Jenks of New York University, compiling macroeconomic data on the American economy and the operations of the Federal Reserve. He was influenced by Wesley Clair Mitchell and started a doctoral program on problems of monetary stabilization but didn't finish it.  His time in America wasn't especially happy.  He had very limited social contacts, missed the cultural life of Vienna, and was troubled by his poverty. His family's financial situation deteriorated significantly after the War. Initially sympathetic to Wieser's democratic socialism he found Marxism rigid and unattractive, and his mild socialist phase lasted until he was about 23.  Hayek's economic thinking shifted away from socialism and toward the classical liberalism of Carl Menger after reading von Mises' book Socialism. It was sometime after reading Socialism that Hayek began attending von Mises' private seminars, joining several of his university friends, including Fritz Machlup, Alfred Schutz, Felix Kaufmann and Gottfried Haberler, who were also participating in Hayek's own more general and private seminar. It was during this time that he also encountered and befriended noted political philosopher Eric Voegelin, with whom he retained a long-standing relationship."

Upon his arrival in London, Hayek was quickly recognised as one of the leading economic theorists in the world and his development of the economics of processes in time and the co-ordination function of prices inspired the ground-breaking work of John Hicks, Abba P. Lerner and many others in the development of modern microeconomics. In 1932, Hayek suggested that private investment in the public markets was a better road to wealth and economic co-ordination in Britain than government spending programs as argued in an exchange of letters with John Maynard Keynes, co-signed with Lionel Robbins and others in The Times. The nearly decade long deflationary depression in Britain dating from Winston Churchill's decision in 1925 to return Britain to the gold standard at the old pre-war and pre-inflationary par was the public policy backdrop for Hayek's dissenting engagement with Keynes over British monetary and fiscal policy. Keynes called Hayek's book Prices and Production \"one of the most frightful muddles I have ever read\", famously adding: \"It is an extraordinary example of how, starting with a mistake, a remorseless logician can end in Bedlam\". Notable economists who studied with Hayek at the LSE in the 1930s and 1940s include Arthur Lewis, Ronald Coase, William Baumol, John Maynard Keynes, CH Douglas, John Kenneth Galbraith, Leonid Hurwicz, Abba Lerner, Nicholas Kaldor, George Shackle, Thomas Balogh, L. K. Jha, Arthur Seldon, Paul Rosenstein-Rodan and Oskar Lange. Some were supportive and some were critical of his ideas. Hayek also taught or tutored many other LSE students, including David Rockefeller. Unwilling to return to Austria after the Anschluss brought it under the control of Nazi Germany in 1938, Hayek remained in Britain. Hayek and his children became British subjects in 1938. He held this status for the remainder of his life, but he did not live in Great Britain after 1950. He lived in the United States from 1950 to 1962 and then mostly in Germany, but also briefly in Austria. In 1947, Hayek was elected a Fellow of the Econometric Society."

The title was inspired by the French classical liberal thinker Alexis de Tocqueville's writings on the \"road to servitude\". It was first published in Britain by Routledge in March 1944 and was quite popular, leading Hayek to call it \"that unobtainable book\" also due in part to wartime paper rationing. When it was published in the United States by the University of Chicago in September of that year, it achieved greater popularity than in Britain. At the instigation of editor Max Eastman, the American magazine Reader's Digest also published an abridged version in April 1945, enabling The Road to Serfdom to reach a far wider audience than academics. The book is widely popular among those advocating individualism and classical liberalism."

After spending the 1949\u20131950 academic year as a visiting professor at the University of Arkansas, Hayek was conferred professorship by the University of Chicago, where he became a professor in the Committee on Social Thought. Hayek's salary was funded not by the university, but by an outside foundation, the William Volker Fund. Hayek had made contact with many at the University of Chicago in the 1940s, with Hayek's The Road to Serfdom playing a seminal role in transforming how Milton Friedman and others understood how society works. Hayek conducted a number of influential faculty seminars while at the University of Chicago and a number of academics worked on research projects sympathetic to some of Hayek's own, such as Aaron Director, who was active in the Chicago School in helping to fund and establish what became the \"Law and Society\" program in the University of Chicago Law School. Hayek, Frank Knight, Friedman and George Stigler worked together in forming the Mont P\u00e8lerin Society, an international forum for neoliberals. Hayek and Friedman cooperated in support of the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists, later renamed the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, an American student organisation devoted to libertarian ideas. Although they shared most political beliefs, disagreeing primarily on question of monetary policy, Hayek and Friedman worked in separate university departments with different research interests and never developed a close working relationship. According to Alan O. Ebenstein, who wrote biographies of both of them, Hayek probably had a closer friendship with Keynes than with Friedman. Hayek received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1954. Another influential political philosopher and German-speaking exile at the University of Chicago at the time was Leo Strauss, but according to his student Joseph Cropsey who also knew Hayek, there was no contact between the two of them. After editing a book on John Stuart Mill's letters he planned to publish two books on the liberal order, The Constitution of Liberty and \"The Creative Powers of a Free Civilization\" (eventually the title for the second chapter of The Constitution of Liberty). He completed The Constitution of Liberty in May 1959, with publication in February 1960. Hayek was concerned that \"with that condition of men in which coercion of some by others is reduced as much as is possible in society\". Hayek was disappointed that the book did not receive the same enthusiastic general reception as The Road to Serfdom had sixteen years before. He left Chicago mostly because of financial reasons, being concerned about his pension provisions.  His primary source of income was his salary and he received some additional money from book royalties, but avoided other lucrative sources of income for academics such as writing textbooks.  He spent a lot on his frequent travels.  He regularly spent summers in Austrian Alps, usually in the Tyrolean village Obergurgl where he enjoyed mountain climbing, and also visited Japan four times with additional trips to Tahiti, Fiji, Indonesia, Australia, New Caledonia and Ceylon.   After his divorce, his financial situation worsened."

He was surprised at being given the award and believed that he was given it with Myrdal to balance the award with someone from the opposite side of the political spectrum. The Sveriges-Riksbank Nobel Prize in Economics was established in 1968, and Hayek was the first non-Keynesian economist to win it. Among the reasons given, the committee stated, Hayek \"was one of the few economists who gave warning of the possibility of a major economic crisis before the great crash came in the autumn of 1929.\" The following year, Hayek further confirmed his original prediction. An interviewer asked, \"We understand that you were one of the only economists to forecast that America was headed for a depression, is that true?\" Hayek responded, \"Yes.\" However, no textual evidence has emerged of \"a prediction\". Indeed, Hayek wrote in October 26, 1929, three days before the crash, \"at present there is no reason to expect a sudden crash of the New York stock exchange. ... The credit possibilities/conditions are, at any rate, currently very great, and therefore it appears assured that an outright crisis-like destruction of the present high [price] level should not be feared.\" During the Nobel ceremony in December 1974, Hayek met the Russian dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Hayek later sent him a Russian translation of The Road to Serfdom. He spoke with apprehension at his award speech about the danger the authority of the prize would lend to an economist, but the prize brought much greater public awareness to the then controversial ideas of Hayek and was described by his biographer as \"the great rejuvenating event in his life\"."

        "content": "In February 1975, Margaret Thatcher was elected leader of the British Conservative Party. The Institute of Economic Affairs arranged a meeting between Hayek and Thatcher in London soon after. During Thatcher's only visit to the Conservative Research Department in the summer of 1975, a speaker had prepared a paper on why the \"middle way\" was the pragmatic path the Conservative Party should take, avoiding the extremes of left and right. Before he had finished, Thatcher \"reached into her briefcase and took out a book. It was Hayek's The Constitution of Liberty. Interrupting our pragmatist, she held the book up for all of us to see. 'This', she said sternly, 'is what we believe', and banged Hayek down on the table\". Despite the media depictions of him as Thatcher's guru and power behind the throne, the communication between him and the Prime Minister was not very regular, they were in contact only once or twice a year.  Besides Thatcher, Hayek also made a significant influence on Enoch Powell, Keith Joseph, Nigel Lawson, Geoffrey Howe and John Biffen. Hayek gained some controversy in 1978 by praising Thatcher's anti-immigration policy proposal in an article which ignited numerous accusations of anti-Semitism and racism because of his reflections on the inability of assimilation of Eastern European Jews in the Vienna of his youth.  He defended himself by explaining that he made no racial judgements, only highlighted the problems of acculturation. In 1977, Hayek was critical of the Lib\u2013Lab pact in which the British Liberal Party agreed to keep the British Labour government in office. Writing to The Times, Hayek said: \"May one who has devoted a large part of his life to the study of the history and the principles of liberalism point out that a party that keeps a socialist government in power has lost all title to the name 'Liberal'. Certainly no liberal can in future vote 'Liberal'\". Hayek was criticised by Liberal politicians Gladwyn Jebb and Andrew Phillips, who both claimed that the purpose of the pact was to discourage socialist legislation. Lord Gladwyn pointed out that the German Free Democrats were in coalition with the German Social Democrats. Hayek was defended by Professor Antony Flew, who stated that\u2014unlike the British Labour Party\u2014the German Social Democrats had since the late 1950s abandoned public ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange and had instead embraced the social market economy. In 1978, Hayek came into conflict with Liberal Party leader David Steel, who claimed that liberty was possible only with \"social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth and power, which in turn require a degree of active government intervention\" and that the Conservative Party were more concerned with the connection between liberty and private enterprise than between liberty and democracy. Hayek claimed that a limited democracy might be better than other forms of limited government at protecting liberty, but that an unlimited democracy was worse than other forms of unlimited government because \"its government loses the power even to do what it thinks right if any group on which its majority depends thinks otherwise\". Hayek stated that if the Conservative leader had said \"that free choice is to be exercised more in the market place than in the ballot box, she has merely uttered the truism that the first is indispensable for individual freedom while the second is not: free choice can at least exist under a dictatorship that can limit itself but not under the government of an unlimited democracy which cannot\". Hayek supported Britain in the Falklands War, writing that it would be justified to attack Argentinian territory instead of just defending the islands, which earned him a lot of criticism in Argentina, a country which he also visited several times.  He was also displeased by the weak response of the United States to the Iran hostage crisis, claiming that an ultimatum should be issued and Iran bombed if they do not comply. He supported Ronald Reagan's decision to keep high defence spending, believing that a strong US military is a guarantee of world peace and necessary to keep the Soviet Union under control.  President Reagan listed Hayek as among the two or three people who most influenced his philosophy and welcomed him to the White House as a special guest. Senator Barry Goldwater listed Hayek as his favourite political philosopher and congressman Jack Kemp named him an inspiration for his political career."

Hayek had hoped to receive a baronetcy and after being awarded the CH sent a letter to his friends requesting that he be called the English version of Friedrich (i.e. Frederick) from now on. After his twenty-minute audience with the Queen, he was \"absolutely besotted\" with her according to his daughter-in-law Esca Hayek. Hayek said a year later that he was \"amazed by her. That ease and skill, as if she'd known me all my life\". The audience with the Queen was followed by a dinner with family and friends at the Institute of Economic Affairs. When later that evening Hayek was dropped off at the Reform Club, he commented: \"I've just had the happiest day of my life\". In 1991, President George H.W.

        "title": "Friedrich Hayek_Business cycle",
        "content": "Ludwig von Mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility to the value of money in his Theory of Money and Credit (1912) in which he also proposed an explanation for \"industrial fluctuations\" based on the ideas of the old British Currency School and of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the Austrian theory of the business cycle. Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle. There, Hayek argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates. Hayek claimed that \"the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process\". Hayek's analysis was based on Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk's concept of the \"average period of production\" and on the effects that monetary policy could have upon it. In accordance with the reasoning later outlined in his essay \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" (1945), Hayek argued that a monopolistic governmental agency like a central bank can neither possess the relevant information which should govern supply of money, nor have the ability to use it correctly. In 1929, Lionel Robbins assumed the helm of the London School of Economics (LSE). Eager to promote alternatives to what he regarded as the narrow approach of the school of economic thought that then dominated the English-speaking academic world (centered at the University of Cambridge and deriving largely from the work of Alfred Marshall), Robbins invited Hayek to join the faculty at LSE, which he did in 1931. According to Nicholas Kaldor, Hayek's theory of the time-structure of capital and of the business cycle initially \"fascinated the academic world\" and appeared to offer a less \"facile and superficial\" understanding of macroeconomics than the Cambridge school's. Also in 1931, Hayek crititicized John Maynard Keynes's Treatise on Money (1930) in his \"Reflections on the pure theory of Mr. J.M. Keynes\" and published his lectures at the LSE in book form as Prices and Production. For Keynes, unemployment and idle resources are caused by a lack of effective demand, but for Hayek they stem from a previous unsustainable episode of easy money and artificially low interest rates. Keynes asked his friend Piero Sraffa to respond. Sraffa elaborated on the effect of inflation-induced \"forced savings\" on the capital sector and about the definition of a \"natural\" interest rate in a growing economy (see Sraffa\u2013Hayek debate). Others who responded negatively to Hayek's work on the business cycle included John Hicks, Frank Knight and Gunnar Myrdal, who, later on, would share the Sveriges-Riksbank Prize in Economics with him. Kaldor later wrote that Hayek's Prices and Production had produced \"a remarkable crop of critics\" and that the total number of pages in British and American journals dedicated to the resulting debate \"could rarely have been equalled in the economic controversies of the past\". Hayek's work, throughout the 1940s, was largely ignored, except for scathing critiques by Nicholas Kaldor. Lionel Robbins himself, who had embraced the Austrian theory of the business cycle in The Great Depression (1934), later regretted having written the book and accepted many of the Keynesian counter-arguments. Hayek never produced the book-length treatment of \"the dynamics of capital\" that he had promised in the Pure Theory of Capital.  At the University of Chicago, Hayek was not part of the economics department and did not influence the rebirth of neoclassical theory that took place there (see Chicago school of economics). When in 1974 he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics with Myrdal, the latter complained about being paired with an \"ideologue\". Milton Friedman declared himself \"an enormous admirer of Hayek, but not for his economics. Milton Friedman also commented on some of his writings, saying \"I think Prices and Production is a very flawed book. I think his [Pure Theory of Capital] is unreadable. On the other hand, The Road to Serfdom is one of the great books of our time\"."

        "content": "Building on the earlier work of Mises and others, Hayek also argued that while in centrally planned economies an individual or a select group of individuals must determine the distribution of resources, these planners will never have enough information to carry out this allocation reliably. This argument, first proposed by Max Weber and Ludwig von Mises, says that the efficient exchange and use of resources can be maintained only through the price mechanism in free markets (see economic calculation problem). In 1935, Hayek published Collectivist Economic Planning, a collection of essays from an earlier debate that had been initiated by Mises. Hayek included Mises's essay in which Mises argued that rational planning was impossible under socialism. Socialist Oskar Lange responded by invoking general equilibrium theory, which they argued disproved Mises's thesis. They noted that the difference between a planned and a free market system lay in who was responsible for solving the equations. They argued that if some of the prices chosen by socialist managers were wrong, gluts or shortages would appear, signalling them to adjust the prices up or down, just as in a free market. Through such a trial and error, a socialist economy could mimic the efficiency of a free market system while avoiding its many problems. Hayek challenged this vision in a series of contributions. In \"Economics and Knowledge\" (1937), he pointed out that the standard equilibrium theory assumed that all agents have full and correct information, and how, in his mind, in the real world different individuals have different bits of knowledge and furthermore some of what they believe is wrong. In \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" (1945), Hayek argued that the price mechanism serves to share and synchronise local and personal knowledge, allowing society's members to achieve diverse and complicated ends through a principle of spontaneous self-organization. He contrasted the use of the price mechanism with central planning, arguing that the former allows for more rapid adaptation to changes in particular circumstances of time and place. Thus, Hayek set the stage for Oliver Williamson's later contrast between markets and hierarchies as alternative co-ordination mechanisms for economic transactions. He used the term catallaxy to describe a \"self-organizing system of voluntary co-operation\". Hayek's research into this argument was specifically cited by the Nobel Committee in its press release awarding Hayek the Nobel prize."

Hayek also wrote that the state can play a role in the economy, specifically in creating a safety net, saying: There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health. Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision. \"The Denationalization of Money\" is one of his literary works, in which he advocated the establishment of competitions in issuing moneys."

Hayek's expansion of the \"Hebbian synapse\" construction into a global brain theory received attention in neuroscience, cognitive science, computer science, and evolutionary psychology by scientists such as Gerald Edelman, Vittorio Guidano and Joaquin Fuster. The Sensory Order can be viewed as a development of his attack on scientism. Hayek posited two orders, namely the sensory order that we experience and the natural order that natural science revealed. Hayek thought that the sensory order actually is a product of the brain. He described the brain as a very complex yet self-ordering hierarchical classification system, a huge network of connections. Because of the nature of the classifier system, richness of our sensory experience can exist.

        "content": "In the latter half of his career, Hayek made a number of contributions to social and political philosophy which he based on his views on the limits of human knowledge and the idea of spontaneous order in social institutions. He argues in favour of a society organised around a market order in which the apparatus of state is employed almost (though not entirely) exclusively to enforce the legal order (consisting of abstract rules and not particular commands) necessary for a market of free individuals to function. These ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from epistemological concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge. Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic and free-market polity would be self-regulating to such a degree that it would be \"a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it\". Although Hayek believed in a society governed by laws, he disapproved of the notion of \"social justice\". He compared the market to a game in which \"there is no point in calling the outcome just or unjust\" and argued that \"social justice is an empty phrase with no determinable content\". Likewise, \"the results of the individual's efforts are necessarily unpredictable, and the question as to whether the resulting distribution of incomes is just has no meaning\". He generally regarded government redistribution of income or capital as an unacceptable intrusion upon individual freedom, saying that \"the principle of distributive justice, once introduced, would not be fulfilled until the whole of society was organized in accordance with it. This would produce a kind of society which in all essential respects would be the opposite of a free society\"."

        "content": "Hayek viewed the free price system not as a conscious invention (that which is intentionally designed by man), but as spontaneous order or what Scottish philosopher Adam Ferguson referred to as \"the result of human action but not of human design\". For instance, Hayek put the price mechanism on the same level as language, which he developed in his price signal theory. Hayek attributed the birth of civilisation to private property in his book The Fatal Conceit (1988). He explained that price signals are the only means of enabling each economic decision maker to communicate tacit knowledge or dispersed knowledge to each other to solve the economic calculation problem. Alain de Benoist of the Nouvelle Droite (New Right) produced a highly critical essay on Hayek's work in an issue of Telos, citing the flawed assumptions behind Hayek's idea of \"spontaneous order\" and the authoritarian and totalising implications of his free-market ideology. Hayek's concept of the market as a spontaneous order was recently applied to ecosystems to defend a broadly non-interventionist policy. Like the market, ecosystems contain complex networks of information, involve an ongoing dynamic process, contain orders within orders and the entire system operates without being directed by a conscious mind. On this analysis, species takes the place of price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements. Human ignorance about the countless interactions between the organisms of an ecosystem limits our ability to manipulate nature. Hayek's price signal concept is in relation to how consumers are often unaware of specific events that change market, yet change their decisions, simply because the price goes up. Thus pricing communicates information."

Summarizing Hayek's views on the topic, journalist Nicholas Wapshott has argued that \"[Hayek] advocated mandatory universal health care and unemployment insurance, enforced, if not directly provided, by the state\". Critical theorist Bernard Harcourt has argued further that \"Hayek was adamant about this\". In 1944, Hayek wrote in The Road to Serfdom: In 1973, Hayek reiterated in Law, Legislation and Liberty: There is no reason why in a free society government should not assure to all, protection against severe deprivation in the form of an assured minimum income, or a floor below which nobody need to descend. To enter into such an insurance against extreme misfortune may well be in the interest of all; or it may be felt to be a clear moral duty of all to assist, within the organised community, those who cannot help themselves.  So long as such a uniform minimum income is provided outside the market to all those who, for any reason, are unable to earn in the market an adequate maintenance, this need not lead to a restriction of freedom, or conflict with the Rule of law."

Diamond argued: The human mind, Hayek says, is not just limited in its ability to synthesize a vast array of concrete facts, it is also limited in its ability to give a deductively sound ground to ethics. Here is where the tension develops, for he also wants to give a reasoned moral defense of the free market. He is an intellectual skeptic who wants to give political philosophy a secure intellectual foundation. It is thus not too surprising that what results is confused and contradictory. Chandran Kukathas argues that Hayek's defence of liberalism is unsuccessful because it rests on presuppositions that are incompatible. The unresolved dilemma of his political philosophy is how to mount a systematic defence of liberalism if one emphasizes the limited capacity of reason. Norman P. Barry similarly notes that the \"critical rationalism\" in Hayek's writings appears incompatible with \"a certain kind of fatalism, that we must wait for evolution to pronounce its verdict\". Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argue that the element of paradox exists in the views of Hayek. Noting Hayek's vigorous defense of \"invisible hand\" evolution that Hayek claimed created better economic institutions than could be created by rational design, Friedman pointed out the irony that Hayek was then proposing to replace the monetary system thus created with a deliberate construct of his own design. John N. Gray summarized this view as \"his scheme for an ultra-liberal constitution was a prototypical version of the philosophy he had attacked\". Bruce Caldwell wrote that \"[i]f one is judging his work against the standard of whether he provided a finished political philosophy, Hayek clearly did not succeed\", although he thinks that \"economists may find Hayek's political writings useful\"."

Hayek hoped that his book\u2014this \"preliminary sketch of new constitutional principles\"\u2014\"may assist\" Salazar \"in his endeavour to design a constitution which is proof against the abuses of democracy\". Hayek visited Chile in the 1970s and 1980s during the Government Junta of general Augusto Pinochet and accepted being appointed Honorary Chairman of the Centro de Estudios P\u00fablicos, the think tank formed by the economists who transformed Chile into a free market economy. Asked about the military dictatorship of Chile by a Chilean interviewer, Hayek is translated from German to Spanish to English as having said the following: As long term institutions, I am totally against dictatorships. But a dictatorship may be a necessary system for a transitional period. [...] Personally I prefer a liberal dictatorship to democratic government devoid of liberalism. My personal impression\u2014and this is valid for South America\u2014is that in Chile, for example, we will witness a transition from a dictatorial government to a liberal government. In a letter to the London Times, he defended the Pinochet regime and said that he had \"not been able to find a single person even in much maligned Chile who did not agree that personal freedom was much greater under Pinochet than it had been under Allende\". Hayek admitted that \"it is not very likely that this will succeed, even if, at a particular point in time, it may be the only hope there is\", but he explained that \"[i]t is not certain hope, because it will always depend on the goodwill of an individual, and there are very few individuals one can trust. But if it is the sole opportunity which exists at a particular moment it may be the best solution despite this. And only if and when the dictatorial government is visibly directing its steps towards limited democracy\". For Hayek, the distinction between authoritarianism and totalitarianism has much importance and he was at pains to emphasise his opposition to totalitarianism, noting that the concept of transitional dictatorship which he defended was characterised by authoritarianism, not totalitarianism. For example, when Hayek visited Venezuela in May 1981, he was asked to comment on the prevalence of totalitarian regimes in Latin America. In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America. The only one was Chile under Allende\". For Hayek, the word \"totalitarian\" signifies something very specific, namely the intention to \"organize the whole of society\" to attain a \"definite social goal\" which is stark in contrast to \"liberalism and individualism\". He claimed that democracy can also be repressive and totalitarian; in The Constitution of Liberty he often refers to Jacob Talmon's concept of totalitarian democracy."

We must face the fact that we here encounter a limit to the universal application of those liberal principles of policy which the existing facts of the present world make unavoidable. He was not sympathetic to nationalist ideas and was afraid that mass immigration might revive nationalist sentiment among domestic population and ruin the postwar progress that was made among Western nations. He additionally explained: However far modern man accepts in principle the ideal that the same rules should apply to all men, in fact he does concede it only to those whom he regards as similar to himself, and only slowly learns to extend the range of those he does accept as his likes. There is little legislation can do to speed up this process and much it may do to reverse it by re-awakening sentiments that are already on the wane. Despite his opposition to nationalism, Hayek made numerous controversial and inflammatory comments about specific ethnic groups. Answering an interview question about people he cannot deal with he mentioned his dislike of Middle Eastern populations, claiming they were dishonest, and also expressed \"profound dislike\" of Indian students at London School of Economics, saying that were usually \"detestable sons of Bengali moneylenders\". He claimed that his attitude is not based on any racial feeling.  During World War II he discussed the possibility of sending his children to the United States, but was concerned that they might be placed with a \"coloured family\".  In a later interview, questioned about his attitude towards Black people, he said laconically that he \"did not like dancing Negroes\" and on another occasion he ridiculed the decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Martin Luther King Jr.. He also made negative comments about awarding the Prize to Ralph Bunche, Albert Luthuli, and his LSE colleague W. Arthur Lewis who he described as an \"unusually able West Indian negro\". In 1978 Hayek made a month-long visit to South Africa (his third) where he gave numerous lectures, interviews, and met prominent politicians and business leaders, unconcerned about possible propagandistic effect of his tour for Apartheid regime. He expressed his opposition to some of the government policies, believing that publicly funded institutions should treat all citizens equally, but also claimed that private institutions have the right to discriminate.  Additionally, he condemned the \"scandalous\" hostility and interference of the international community in South African internal affairs.  He further explained his attitude: People in South Africa have to deal with their own problems, and the idea that you can use external pressure to change people, who after all have built up a civilization of a kind, seems to me morally a very doubtful belief. While Hayek gave somewhat ambiguous comments on the injustices of Apartheid and proper role of the state, some of his Mont Pelerin colleagues, such as John Davenport and Wilhelm R\u00f6pke, were more ardent supporters of South African government and criticized Hayek for being too soft on the subject."

He emphasized the importance of nature, complaining that it became too fashionable to ascribe all human differences to environment. Hayek defended economic inequality, believing that the existence of wealthy class is important not only for economic reasons\u2014accumulating capital and directing investments\u2014but also for political, cultural, scientific and conservationist goals which are often financed and promoted by philanthropists.  Since the market mechanism cannot provide for all societal needs, some of which are outside of economic calculation, existence of wealthy individuals guarantees the efficiency and pluralism in their development and realization, which could not be guaranteed in the case of state monopoly. Individual wealth offers independence and can create intellectual, moral, political and artistic leaders which are not employed and influenced by the state. According to Hayek the society benefits from having a hereditary wealthy class because individuals born in it don't have to devote their energy to earning a living and can devote themselves to other purposes such as experimenting with different ideas, hobbies and lifestyles which can later be adopted by broader society. In The Constitution of Liberty he wrote: Yet is it really so obvious that the tennis or golf professional is a more useful member of society than the wealthy amateurs who devoted their time to perfecting these games? Or that the paid curator of a public museum is more useful than a private collector? Before the reader answers these questions too hastily, I would ask him to consider whether there would ever have been golf or tennis professionals or museum curators if wealthy amateurs had not preceded them. Can we not hope that other new interests will still arise from the playful explorations of those who can indulge in them for the short span of a human life? It is only natural that the development of the art of living and of the non-materialistic values should have profited most from the activities of those who had no material worries. He contrasted individuals who inherited wealth, with upper class values and education, with the nouveau riche who often use their wealth in more vulgar ways. He decried the disappearance of such leisured aristocratic class, claiming that contemporary Western elites are usually business groups that lack intellectual leadership and coherent \"philosophy of life\" and use their wealth mostly for economic purposes. Hayek was against high taxes on inheritance, believing that it is natural function of the family to transmit standards, traditions and material goods. Without transmission of property, parents might try to secure the future of their children by placing them in prestigious and high-paying positions, as was customary in socialist countries, which creates even worse injustices. He was also strongly against progressive taxation, noting that in most countries additional taxes paid by the rich amount to insignificantly small amount of total tax revenue and that the only major result of the policy is \"gratification of the envy of the less-well-off\". He also claimed that it is contrary to idea of equality under law and against democratic principle that majority should not impose discriminatory rules against minority."

With regard to the popularity of his Nobel acceptance lecture, Hayek is the second-most frequently cited economist (after Kenneth Arrow) in the Nobel lectures of the prize winners in economics. Hayek wrote critically there of the field of orthodox economics and neo-classical modelisation. A number of Nobel Laureates in economics, such as Vernon Smith and Herbert A. Simon, recognise Hayek as the greatest modern economist. Another Nobel winner, Paul Samuelson, believed that Hayek was worthy of his award, but nevertheless claimed that \"there were good historical reasons for fading memories of Hayek within the mainstream last half of the twentieth century economist fraternity. In 1931, Hayek's Prices and Production had enjoyed an ultra-short Byronic success. In retrospect hindsight tells us that its mumbo-jumbo about the period of production grossly misdiagnosed the macroeconomics of the 1927\u20131931 (and the 1931\u20132007) historical scene\". Despite this comment, Samuelson spent the last 50 years of his life obsessed with the problems of capital theory identified by Hayek and B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, and Samuelson flatly judged Hayek to have been right and his own teacher Joseph Schumpeter to have been wrong on the central economic question of the 20th century, the feasibility of socialist economic planning in a production goods dominated economy. Hayek is widely recognised for having introduced the time dimension to the equilibrium construction and for his key role in helping inspire the fields of growth theory, information economics and the theory of spontaneous order. The \"informal\" economics presented in Milton Friedman's massively influential popular work Free to Choose (1980) is explicitly Hayekian in its account of the price system as a system for transmitting and co-ordinating knowledge. This can be explained by the fact that Friedman taught Hayek's famous paper \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" (1945) in his graduate seminars. In 1944, he was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy after he was nominated for membership by Keynes. Harvard economist and former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers explains Hayek's place in modern economics: \"What's the single most important thing to learn from an economics course today? What I tried to leave my students with is the view that the invisible hand is more powerful than the [un]hidden hand. Things will happen in well-organized efforts without direction, controls, plans. That's the consensus among economists. That's the Hayek legacy\". By 1947, Hayek was an organiser of the Mont Pelerin Society, a group of classical liberals who sought to oppose socialism. Hayek was also instrumental in the founding of the Institute of Economic Affairs, the right-wing libertarian and free-market think tank that inspired Thatcherism. He was in addition a member of the conservative and libertarian Philadelphia Society. Hayek had a long-standing and close friendship with philosopher of science Karl Popper, who was also from Vienna. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated: \"I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps Alfred Tarski\". Popper dedicated his Conjectures and Refutations to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, to Popper and in 1982 said that \"ever since his Logik der Forschung first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology\". Popper also participated in the inaugural meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society. Their friendship and mutual admiration do not change the fact that there are important differences between their ideas. Hayek also played a central role in Milton Friedman's intellectual development. Friedman wrote: My interest in public policy and political philosophy was rather casual before I joined the faculty of the University of Chicago. Informal discussions with colleagues and friends stimulated a greater interest, which was reinforced by Friedrich Hayek's powerful book The Road to Serfdom, by my attendance at the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, and by discussions with Hayek after he joined the university faculty in 1950. In addition, Hayek attracted an exceptionally able group of students who were dedicated to a libertarian ideology. They started a student publication, The New Individualist Review, which was the outstanding libertarian journal of opinion for some years. I served as an adviser to the journal and published a number of articles in it.... While Friedman often mentioned Hayek as an important influence, Hayek rarely mentioned Friedman.  He deeply disagreed with Chicago School methodology, quantitative and macroeconomic focus, and claimed that Friedman's Essays in Positive Economics was as dangerous a book as Keynes' General Theory.  Friedman also claimed that despite some Popperian influence Hayek always retained basic Misesian praxeological view which he found \"utterly nonsensical\".  He also noted that he admired Hayek only for his political works, and disagreed with his technical economics; he called Prices and Production a \"very flawed book\" and The Pure Theory of Capital \"unreadable\".   There were occasional tensions at the Mont Pelerin meetings between the Hayek's and Friedman's followers that sometimes threatened to split the Society.  Although they worked at the same university and shared political beliefs, Hayek and Friedman rarely collaborated professionally and were not close friends. Hayek's greatest intellectual debt was to Carl Menger, who pioneered an approach to social explanation similar to that developed in Britain by Bernard Mandeville and the Scottish moral philosophers in the Scottish Enlightenment. He had a wide-reaching influence on contemporary economics, politics, philosophy, sociology, psychology and anthropology. For example, Hayek's discussion in The Road to Serfdom (1944) about truth, falsehood and the use of language influenced some later opponents of postmodernism. Some radical libertarians had a negative view of Hayek and his milder form of liberalism. Ayn Rand disliked him, seeing him as a conservative and compromiser.  In a letter to Rose Wilder Lane in 1946 she wrote:Now to your question: 'Do those almost with us do more harm than 100% enemies?' I don't think this can be answered with a flat 'yes' or 'no,' because the 'almost' is such a wide term. There is one general rule to observe: those who are with us, but merely do not go far enough are the ones who may do us some good. Those who agree with us in some respects, yet preach contradictory ideas at the same time, are definitely more harmful than 100% enemies. As an example of the kind of 'almost' I would tolerate, I'd name Ludwig von Mises. As an example of our most pernicious enemy, I would name Hayek. That one is real poison. Hayek made no known written references to Rand. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales was influenced by Hayek's ideas on spontaneous order and the Austrian School of economics, after being exposed to these ideas by Austrian economist and Mises Institute Senior Fellow Mark Thornton."

        "content": "Hayek received new attention in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of conservative governments in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. After winning the 1979 United Kingdom general election, Margaret Thatcher appointed Keith Joseph, the director of the Hayekian Centre for Policy Studies, as her secretary of state for industry in an effort to redirect parliament's economic strategies. Likewise, David Stockman, Ronald Reagan's most influential financial official in 1981, was an acknowledged follower of Hayek. Hayek wrote an essay, \"Why I Am Not a Conservative\" (included as an appendix to The Constitution of Liberty). In it he disparaged conservatism for its inability to adapt to changing human realities or to offer a positive political program, remarking: \"Conservatism is only as good as what it conserves\". Although he noted that modern day American and British conservatism share many opinions on economics with classical liberals, particularly a belief in the free market, he believed it is because conservatism wants to \"stand still\" whereas liberalism embraces the free market because it \"wants to go somewhere\". He was much more critical of conservativism in continental Europe which he saw as more similar to socialism.  European conservatives, according to Hayek, are similar to socialists in their belief that social and political problems can be solved by placing right people in governmental positions and giving them the opportunity to rule without much restrictions.  Both are less concerned with limiting state power and more concerned with arbitrarily using that power to promote their own goals and force their values on other people. Hayek also disliked conservative tendency to obscurantism, such as rejection of theory of evolution and naturalistic explanations of life because of supposedly problematic moral consequences that follow from them. He opposed conservatism for \"its hostility to internationalism and its proneness to a strident nationalism\", with its frequent association with imperialism. He also criticized the intolerance and lack of pluralism: What I mean is that he [conservative] has no political principles which enable him to work with people whose moral values differ from his own for a political order in which both can obey their convictions. It is the recognition of such principles that permits the coexistence of different sets of values that makes it possible to build a peaceful society with a minimum of force. The acceptance of such principles means that we agree to tolerate much that we dislike. There are many values of the conservative which appeal to me more than those of the socialists; yet for a liberal the importance he personally attaches to specific goals is no sufficient justification for forcing others to serve them. Hayek identified himself as a classical liberal, but noted that in the United States it had become almost impossible to use \"liberal\" in its original definition and the term \"libertarian\" was used instead. He also found libertarianism a term \"singularly unattractive\" and offered the term \"Old Whig\" (a phrase borrowed from Edmund Burke) instead. In his later life, he said: \"I am becoming a Burkean Whig\". Whiggery as a political doctrine had little affinity for classical political economy, the tabernacle of the Manchester School and William Gladstone. Samuel Brittan, concluded in 2010 that \"Hayek's book [The Constitution of Liberty] is still probably the most comprehensive statement of the underlying ideas of the moderate free market philosophy espoused by neoliberals\". Brittan adds that although Raymond Plant (2009) comes out in the end against Hayek's doctrines, Plant gives The Constitution of Liberty a \"more thorough and fair-minded analysis than it has received even from its professed adherents\". As a neo-liberal, he helped found the Mont Pelerin Society, a prominent neo-liberal think tank where many other minds, such as Mises and Friedman gathered. Although Hayek is likely a student of the neo-liberal school of libertarianism, he is nonetheless influential in the conservative movement, mainly for his critique of collectivism."

        "content": "Hayek's ideas on spontaneous order and the importance of prices in dealing with the knowledge problem inspired a debate on economic development and transition economies after the fall of the Berlin wall. For instance, economist Peter Boettke elaborated in detail on why reforming socialism failed and the Soviet Union broke down. Economist Ronald McKinnon uses Hayekian ideas to describe the challenges of transition from a centralized state and planned economy to a market economy. Former World Bank Chief Economist William Easterly emphasizes why foreign aid tends to have no effect at best in books such as The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good. Since the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis, there is a renewed interest in Hayek's core explanation of boom-and-bust cycles, which serves as an alternative explanation to that of the savings glut as launched by economist and former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke. Economists at the Bank for International Settlements, e.g. William R. White, emphasize the importance of Hayekian insights and the impact of monetary policies and credit growth as root causes of financial cycles. Andreas Hoffmann and Gunther Schnabl provide an international perspective and explain recurring financial cycles in the world economy as consequence of gradual interest rate cuts led by the central banks in the large advanced economies since the 1980s. Nicolas Cachanosky outlines the impact of American monetary policy on the production structure in Latin America. In line with Hayek, an increasing number of contemporary researchers sees expansionary monetary policies and too low interest rates as mal-incentives and main drivers of financial crises in general and the subprime market crisis in particular. To prevent problems caused by monetary policy, Hayekian and Austrian economists discuss alternatives to current policies and organizations. For instance, Lawrence H. White argued in favor of free banking in the spirit of Hayek's \"Denationalization of Money\". Along with market monetarist economist Scott Sumner, White also noted that the monetary policy norm that Hayek prescribed, first in Prices and Production (1931) and as late as the 1970s, was the stabilization of nominal income. Hayek's ideas find their way into the discussion of the post-Great Recession issues of secular stagnation. Monetary policy and mounting regulation are argued to have undermined the innovative forces of the market economies. Quantitative easing following the financial crises is argued to have not only conserved structural distortions in the economy, leading to a fall in trend-growth. It also created new distortions and contributes to distributional conflicts."

        "content": "In August 1926, Hayek married Helen Berta Maria von Fritsch (1901\u20131960), a secretary at the civil service office where Hayek worked. They had two children together. Upon the close of World War II, Hayek restarted a relationship with an old girlfriend, who had married since they first met, but kept it secret until 1948. Hayek and Fritsch divorced in July 1950 and he married his cousin Helene Bitterlich (1900\u20131996) just a few weeks later after moving to Arkansas to take advantage of permissive divorce laws. His wife and children were offered settlement and compensation for accepting a divorce. The divorce caused some scandal at LSE where certain academics refused to have anything to do with Hayek. In a 1978 interview to explain his actions, Hayek stated that he was unhappy in his first marriage and as his wife would not grant him a divorce he had to enforce it. After divorce, for a time, Hayek rarely visited his children, but continued more regular contact with them in his older age, after moving to Europe.  Hayek's son, Laurence Hayek (1934\u20132004) was a distinguished microbiologist. His daughter Christine was an entomologist at the British Museum of Natural History, and she cared for him during his last years of declining health. Gustav Jorberg, an associate member of the 1993 Nobel Prize Selection Committee claims that they paired Hayek and Swedish Economist, Gunnar Myrdal, with the prize in the same year as a slight to Myrdal. Not only for the political differences between Hayek and Myrdal, but because Hayek had 'paired' with Myrdal's wife, Alva, in an extra-marital affair. Hayek had a lifelong interest in biology and was also concerned with ecology and environmental protection.  After being awarded Nobel Prize he offered his name to be used for endorsements by World Wildlife Fund, National Audubon Society, and conservationist National Trust. Evolutionary biology was simply one of his interests in natural sciences. Hayek also had a unique interest in epistemology, which he often applied to his own thinking, as a social scientist. He held that methodological differences in the social sciences and in natural sciences were key to understanding why, in his mind, incompetent policies are often allowed. Hayek was brought up in non-religious setting and decided that he was an agnostic from age 15. He died in 1992 in Freiburg, Germany, where he had lived since leaving Chicago in 1961. Despite his advanced age by the 80s, he continued to write, even finishing a book, The Fatal Conceit, in 1988."

His influence and contributions have been noted by many. A number of tributes have resulted, many established posthumously: The Hayek Society, a student-run group at the London School of Economics, was established in his honour. The Oxford Hayek Society, founded in 1983, is named after Hayek. The Cato Institute named its lower level auditorium after Hayek, who had been a Distinguished Senior Fellow at Cato during his later years. The auditorium of the school of economics in Universidad Francisco Marroqu\u00edn in Guatemala is named after him. The Hayek Fund for Scholars of the Institute for Humane Studies provides financial awards for academic career activities of graduate students and untenured faculty members. The Ludwig von Mises Institute holds a lecture named after Hayek every year at its Austrian Scholars Conference and invites notable academics to speak about subjects relating to Hayek's contributions to the Austrian School. George Mason University has an economics essay award named in honour of Hayek. The Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank also at George Mason University, who has a philosophy, politics and economics program of study named for Hayek. The Mont Pelerin Society has a quadrennial economics essay contest named in his honour. Hayek was awarded honorary degrees from Rikkyo University, University of Vienna and University of Salzburg. Hayek has an investment portfolio named after him. The Hayek Fund invests in corporations who financially support free market public policy organisations"

Throughout his career, Belushi had a personal and artistic partnership with his fellow SNL star Dan Aykroyd, whom he met while they were both working at Chicago's Second City comedy club. Born in Chicago to Albanian American parents, Belushi started his own comedy troupe with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas, called \"The West Compass Trio\". After being discovered by Bernard Sahlins, he performed with The Second City and met Aykroyd, Brian Doyle-Murray and Harold Ramis. In 1975, Belushi was recommended to SNL creator and showrunner Lorne Michaels by Chevy Chase and Michael O'Donoghue, who accepted Belushi as a new cast member of the show after an audition. He developed a series of characters on the show that reached high success, including his performances as Henry Kissinger and Ludwig van Beethoven. Belushi's Albanian ancestry lent itself to his \"Olympia Restaurant\" sketch (in which he sold nothing but \"cheeseburgers, cheeps [potato chips] and Pepsi\"). After his breakout film role as John Blutarsky in National Lampoon's Animal House (1978), Belushi appeared in films such as 1941, The Blues Brothers, and Neighbors. He also pursued interests in music, creating with Aykroyd, Lou Marini, Tom Malone, Steve Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, Paul Shaffer, and The Blues Brothers, from which the film received its name. In his personal life, Belushi struggled with heavy drug use that threatened his comedy career; he was dismissed and rehired at SNL on several occasions due to his behavior. In 1982, Belushi died from combined drug intoxication possibly caused by Cathy Smith, who injected him with a mixture of heroin and cocaine known as a speedball at the Chateau Marmont hotel in West Hollywood, California. He was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004."

        "content": "John Adam Belushi was born to Agnes Demetri (n\u00e9e Samaras) Belushi and Adam Anastos Belushi in Humboldt Park, a neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago. Agnes, a pharmacy worker, was born in Ohio to Albanian immigrants from Kor\u00e7\u00eb, while Adam was an Albanian immigrant from Qytez\u00eb, who owned the Fair Oaks restaurant, on North Avenue in Chicago, later a restaurant in Wheaton. Belushi was raised in Wheaton, a suburb west of Chicago, along with his three siblings: younger brothers Billy and Jim, and sister Marian. He was Eastern Orthodox Christian, attending the Albanian Orthodox Church and attended Wheaton Central High School, where he met his future wife, Judith Jacklin. In 1965, Belushi formed a band, the Ravens, together with four fellow high school students (Dick Blasucci, Michael Blasucci, Tony Pavilonis, and Phil Special). They recorded one single, \"Listen to Me Now/Jolly Green Giant.\" Belushi played drums and sang vocals. The record was not successful, and the band broke up when he enrolled at the College of DuPage. He also attended the University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater for a year, which inspired the famous Animal House scene of D-Day driving a motorcycle up the stairs. Belushi acquired the iconic \"College\" crewneck, worn by his character in Animal House, at a print shop when visiting his brother, Jim Belushi, who attended Southern Illinois University."

        "content": "Belushi started his own comedy troupe in Chicago, the West Compass Trio (named after the improvisational cabaret revue Compass Players active from 1955 to 1958 in Chicago), with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas. Their success piqued the interest of Bernard Sahlins, the founder of The Second City improvised comedy enterprise, who went to see them performing in 1971 and asked Belushi to join the cast. At Second City, he met and began working with Harold Ramis, Joe Flaherty and Brian Doyle-Murray. In 1972, Belushi was offered a role, together with Chevy Chase and Christopher Guest, in National Lampoon Lemmings, a parody of Woodstock, which played Off-Broadway in 1972. Belushi and Jacklin moved to New York City. Belushi started working as a writer, director and actor for The National Lampoon Radio Hour, a comedy radio show which was created, produced and written by staff from National Lampoon magazine. Cast members on the shows produced by Belushi included Brian Doyle Murray, Bill Murray, Joe Flaherty, Gilda Radner, Harold Ramis, Christopher Guest and Richard Belzer. During a trip to Toronto to check out the local Second City cast in 1974, he met Dan Aykroyd. Jacklin became an associate producer for the show, and she and Belushi were married on December 31, 1976. \"The National Lampoon Show\" toured the country in 1974; it was produced by Ivan Reitman. Lampoon owner Matty Simmons was offered a TV show on NBC at this time but passed."

        "content": "In 1975, Chase and writer Michael O'Donoghue recommended Belushi to Lorne Michaels as a potential member for a television show Michaels was about to produce called NBC's Saturday Night, later Saturday Night Live (SNL). Michaels was initially undecided, as he was not sure if Belushi's physical humor would fit with what he was envisioning, but he changed his mind after giving Belushi an audition. Over his four-year tenure at SNL, Belushi developed a series of successful characters, including the belligerent Samurai Futaba, Henry Kissinger, Ludwig van Beethoven, the Greek owner (Pete Dionisopoulos) of the Olympia Caf\u00e9, Captain James T. Kirk, and a contributor of furious opinion pieces on Weekend Update, during which he coined his catchphrase, \"But N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!\" With Aykroyd, Belushi created Jake and Elwood, the Blues Brothers. Originally intended to warm up the crowd before the show, the Blues Brothers were eventually featured as musical guests. Belushi also reprised his Lemmings imitation of Joe Cocker. Cocker himself joined Belushi in 1976 to sing \"Feelin' Alright?\" together. Like many of his fellow SNL cast members, Belushi began experimenting heavily with drugs and attended concerts with many of the popular artists of the era including Fleetwood Mac, Meat Loaf, KISS, The Dead Boys, Warren Zevon, The Grateful Dead and The Allman Brothers.  In 1990, Lorne Michaels would remember him as loyal to the writers and a team player but he was fired (and immediately re-hired) by Michaels a number of times. In Rolling Stones February 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to that time, Belushi received the top ranking. \"Belushi was the 'live' in Saturday Night Live\", they wrote, \"the one who made the show happen on the edge ... Nobody embodied the highs and lows of SNL like Belushi.\""

        "content": "In 1978, Belushi performed in the films Old Boyfriends (directed by Joan Tewkesbury), Goin' South (directed by Jack Nicholson), and National Lampoon's Animal House (directed by John Landis). Upon its initial release, National Lampoon's Animal House received generally mixed reviews from critics, but Time magazine and Roger Ebert proclaimed it one of the year's best. Filmed for $2.8 million, it is one of the most profitable movies of all time, garnering an estimated gross of more than $141 million in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising. National Lampoon's Animal House written by Doug Kenney, Harold Ramis and Chris Miller followed in the tradition of the Marx Brothers films that featured subversive and satirical plots that took on traditional institutions. Hollywood studios would try to copy the success without the satire, creating a string of \"Nerd vs. Jocks\" films in the 1980s with cheap sight gags involving nudity and gross-out humor. Stripes and Meatballs starring Bill Murray followed the formula as well and even included a motivational speech in the last act, a la Bluto. Ivan Reitman produced both as well as National Lampoon's Animal House. Following the success of the Blues Brothers on SNL, Belushi and Aykroyd, with the help of pianist-arranger Paul Shaffer, started assembling studio talents to form a proper band. These included SNL saxophonist \"Blue\" Lou Marini and trombonist-saxophonist Tom Malone, who had previously played in Blood, Sweat & Tears. At Shaffer's suggestion, guitarist Steve Cropper and bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, the powerhouse combo from Booker T and the M.G.'s, who played on dozens of hits from Memphis's Stax Records during the 1960s were signed as well. In 1978, the Blues Brothers released their debut album, Briefcase Full of Blues, with Atlantic Records. The album reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and went double platinum. Two singles were released, \"Rubber Biscuit\", which reached No. 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 and \"Soul Man\", which reached No. 14. In 1979, Belushi left SNL with Aykroyd to film The Blues Brothers which conflicted with the shooting schedule of SNL. Lorne Michaels decided to leave at the end of his contract and the network's pressure to use recurring characters were also factors in their decision. They made two movies together after leaving, Neighbors (directed by John Avildsen), and most notably The Blues Brothers (directed by John Landis). Released in the U.S. on June 20, 1980, The Blues Brothers received generally positive reviews. It earned just under $5 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross $115.2 million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video. The Blues Brothers band toured to promote the film, which led to a third album (and second live album), Made in America, recorded at the Universal Amphitheatre in 1980. The track \"Who's Making Love\" peaked at No 39. The only film Belushi made without Aykroyd following his departure from SNL was the romantic comedy Continental Divide (directed by Michael Apted) and written by Lawrence Kasdan. Released in September 1981, it starred Belushi as Chicago hometown hero writer Ernie Souchack (loosely based on newspaper columnist and long-time family friend Mike Royko), who gets an assignment researching a scientist (played by Blair Brown) who studies birds of prey in the remote Rocky Mountains. By 1981, Belushi had become a fan and advocate of the punk rock band Fear after seeing them perform in several after-hours New York City bars, and brought them to Cherokee Studios to record songs for the soundtrack of Neighbors. Blues Brother band member Tom Scott, along with producing partner and Cherokee owner Bruce Robb, initially helped with the session but later pulled out due to conflicts with Belushi. The session was eventually produced by Cropper. The producers of \"Neighbors\" refused to use the song in the movie. Belushi along with SNL head writer Michael O'Donoghue and SNL writer Nelson Lyon booked Fear to play the Halloween 1981 episode of SNL; the telecast of the performance featured then-novel moshing and stage diving, and was cut short by NBC due to the band's profanity. The New York Post published an account of these and other sensationalistic details of the event the following day. At the time of his death, Belushi was pursuing several movie projects, including an ABSCAM-related caper called Moon Over Miami, to be directed by Louis Malle, and a diamond smuggling caper called Noble Rot with Jay Sandrich, based on a script he adapted and rewrote with former SNL writer Don Novello. However, Paramount Studios offered to produce \"Noble Rot\" only if he starred in The Joy of Sex, which would have featured him in a diaper. Dan Aykroyd advised him to turn it down and return to the East Coast where he was writing Ghostbusters. Belushi also talked about producing a drug trafficking film in a High Times tribute article from 1982, \"Belushi wanted to give these daring captains courageous of consciousness the credit they deserved, he told me. He wanted to star in a major marijuana movie to be called Kingpin. He wanted to play the title role.\" Belushi also filmed a \"Guest Star Appearance\" on an episode of the television series Police Squad! (1982) by the creators of Airplane!. The opening of the show featured a running joke which featured a sight gag with the guest star dying right away. He died shortly before the episode was to air, so the scene was cut and replaced by a segment with William Conrad."

        "content": "Belushi had managed to refrain from drug use for a brief period in 1981, but severely relapsed during the production of Neighbors. Less than four months after the shoot, the day before he died, he visited his long-time manager Bernie Brillstein and asked for money. Brillstein declined, strongly suspecting that Belushi wanted money for drugs. Later in the day, Belushi returned and again asked for money. Brillstein complied, reluctant to rebuke Belushi in front of another person. In the early morning hours on the day of his death, Belushi was visited separately by friends Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, as well as Catherine Evelyn Smith. At approximately 12:00 pm PDT on Friday, March 5, 1982, Belushi's fitness trainer and occasional bodyguard Bill Wallace arrived at Belushi's bungalow at the Chateau Marmont to deliver a typewriter and audiocassette recorder because Belushi had requested them the previous day. Wallace found Belushi dead, with no one else present in the bungalow. The cause of death was combined drug intoxication involving cocaine and heroin, a drug combination known as a speedball. Belushi's death was investigated by forensic pathologist Michael Baden, among others, and while the findings were disputed, it was officially ruled a drug-related accident. In an interview with the National Enquirer two months after Belushi's death, Smith admitted that she had been with him at the Chateau Marmont on the night of his death and had given him the fatal speedball shot. After the appearance of the Enquirer article, the case was reopened. Smith was arrested, extradited from Ontario, Canada, and charged with first-degree murder. A plea bargain reduced the charge to involuntary manslaughter, and she served fifteen months in prison. Smith was arrested at the scene, but was released by police after questioning. According to the transcript of Smith's police questioning, they didn't ask where she got the drugs, leading to speculation she was an informant, that the police gave them to her, and that she was let go because it was a sting gone bad. \"Weitzman said that Smith was freed when \"someone she does not know,\" who believes she is being wrongly prosecuted, volunteered to post a bond for her. She was ordered to report to Los Angeles Superior Court on Feb. 11 to enter a plea.\" Belushi's wife arranged for a traditional Orthodox Christian funeral that was conducted by an Albanian Orthodox priest. He was interred at Abel's Hill Cemetery in Chilmark, Massachusetts, on Martha's Vineyard. Belushi's tombstone has a skull and crossbones with the inscription, \"I may be gone but Rock and Roll lives on.\" His body was removed and reburied in an unmarked grave nearby due to fans littering on his original grave. His mother's tombstone at Elmwood Cemetery in River Grove, Illinois, has Belushi's name inscribed on it and thus serves as a cenotaph."

        "content": "Belushi's life was detailed in two books: the 1984 biography Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi by Bob Woodward, whose accuracy has been questioned by journalists and by people close to Belushi, and 1990s Samurai Widow by his widow Judith. Woodward's book was adapted into a 1989 film of the same name, which was denounced by Aykroyd and Judith Belushi and was given poor reviews by critics. Eddie Money wrote \"Passing By the Graveyard (Song for John B.)\", from his 1982 album No Control, in tribute to Belushi. The two became friends after Money was a musical guest on Saturday Night Live during the show's third season.\" The thrash metal group Anthrax penned a song about Belushi on their 1987 album Among the Living, titled \"Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.).\" Polish rock band Lady Pank recorded a song \"John Belushi\" for their 1988 album Tacy sami, with references to his Albanian ancestry. Belushi has been portrayed by actors Eric Siegel in Gilda Radner: It's Always Something, Tyler Labine in Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Mork & Mindy (which also features his friendship with Robin Williams), Michael Chiklis in Wired and John Gemberling in A Futile and Stupid Gesture. Chris Farley, whose life was heavily influenced by Belushi, died in 1997 at age 33 due to a drug overdose, similar to combined drug intoxication, which contribute to the comparisons between Belushi and Farley. Belushi's widow later remarried and is now Judith Jacklin Belushi Pisano. She and co-biographer Tanner Colby produced Belushi: A Biography, a collection of first-person interviews and photographs of John Belushi's life that was published in 2005. Mike Royko, a close friend of the family, and called \"Uncle Mike\" by Belushi, wrote a eulogy for the Chicago Sun-Times on March 7, 1982. Belushi's career and death were prominently featured in the 1999 memoir of his manager Bernie Brillstein, who wrote that he was haunted by the comedian's overdose and learned how to better deal with clients who abuse drugs or alcohol from handling Belushi. In 2004, Belushi was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star located at 6355 Hollywood Boulevard. In 2006, Biography Channel aired an episode of Final 24, a documentary following Belushi during the last twenty-four hours leading to his death. Four years later, Biography aired a full biography documentation of Belushi's life. According to his SNL castmate Jane Curtin, who appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2011, Belushi was a misogynist who would deliberately sabotage the work of female writers and comics while working on SNL. \"So you'd go to a table read, and if a woman writer had written a piece for John, he would not read it in his full voice. He felt as though it was his duty to sabotage pieces written by women.\" SNL writer Anne Beatts suggested that because she was writing a book with Judy Belushi at the time, John was frustrated with them spending more time on the book than with him. He complained to Lorne Michaels about Beatts and Rosie Shuster. Judy Belushi claims Belushi was a \"Women's Libber\" and did not hate women. During the pre-production of Ghostbusters, Ivan Reitman remarked Slimer was sort of like Bluto in the film Animal House, like the ghost of John Belushi. Since then, Slimer has been described as \"The Ghost of John Belushi\" by Dan Aykroyd in many interviews. At the conclusion of the first live SNL episode after Belushi's death (Robert Urich/Mink DeVille on March 20, 1982), Brian Doyle-Murray gave a tribute to him. Belushi was scheduled to present the first Best Visual Effects Oscar at the 1982 Academy Awards with Dan Aykroyd. Aykroyd presented the award alone, and stated from the lectern: \"My partner would have loved presenting this award with me; he was something of a visual effect himself.\" In 2015, John Belushi was ranked by Rolling Stone as the greatest SNL cast member of all time."

He and his colleague at Martin Marietta, David Baker, were the driving force behind Mars Direct, a proposal in a 1990 research paper intended to produce significant reductions in the cost and complexity of such a mission. The key idea was to use the Martian atmosphere to produce oxygen, water, and rocket propellant for the surface stay and return journey.  A modified version of the plan was subsequently adopted by NASA as their \"design reference mission\". He questions the delay and cost-to-benefit ratio of first establishing a base or outpost on an asteroid or another Apollo program-like return to the Moon, as neither would be able to provide all of its own oxygen, water, or energy; these resources are producible on Mars, and he expects people would be there thereafter. Disappointed with the lack of interest from government in Mars exploration and after the success of his book The Case for Mars (1996), as well as leadership experience at the National Space Society, Zubrin established the Mars Society in 1998. This is an international organization advocating a human mission to Mars as a goal, by private funding if possible."

He has developed a number of concepts for space propulsion and exploration, and is the author of over 200 technical and non-technical papers and several books. He is also President of both the Mars Society and Pioneer Astronautics, a private company that does research and development on innovative aerospace technologies. Zubrin is the co-inventor on a U.S. design patent and a U.S. utility patent on a hybrid rocket/airplane, and on a U.S. utility patent on an oxygen supply system (see links below). Zubrin was awarded his first patent at age 20 in 1972 for Three Player Chess. His inventions also include the nuclear salt-water rocket and co-inventor (with Dana Andrews) of the magnetic sail. Zubrin is fellow at Center for Security Policy. During his professional career, Zubrin was a member of Lockheed Martin's scenario development team charged with developing strategies for space exploration. He was also \"a senior engineer with the Martin Marietta Astronautics company, working as one of its leaders in development of advanced concepts for interplanetary missions\". During his time at Martin Marietta, he drafted ideas for a potential single-stage-to-orbit spacecraft, and developed the Black Colt. However, he would eventually leave Martin Marietta to co-form Pioneer Rocketplane with Mitchell Burnside Clapp, an aerospace engineer from the US Air Force, due to a perceived lack of interest in reducing launch costs at larger aerospace firms. In his book, Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization, Zubrin would write about how both large aerospace firms, and the US Government, would fail to reduce the costs of spaceflight. In 1998, Zubrin founded the Mars Society, and in the following years, was able to attract large amounts of public interest to potential human colonisation on Mars. The work of the Mars Society was successful enough as to encourage the US Government to not cut funding for several Mars rover missions."

Giraudoux studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Lakanal in Sceaux and upon graduation traveled extensively in Europe.  After his return to France in 1910, he accepted a position with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  With the outbreak of World War I, he served with distinction and in 1915 became the first writer ever to be awarded the wartime Legion of Honour. He married in 1918 and in the subsequent inter-war period produced the majority of his writing.  He first achieved literary success through his novels, notably Siegfried et le Limousin (1922) and Eglantine (1927).  An ongoing collaboration with actor and theater director Louis Jouvet, beginning in 1928 with Jouvet's radical streamlining of Siegfried for the stage, stimulated his writing. But it is his plays that gained him international renown.  He became well known in the English speaking world largely because of the award-winning adaptations of his plays by Christopher Fry (Tiger at the Gates) and Maurice Valency (The Madwoman of Chaillot, Ondine, The Enchanted, The Apollo of Bellac). Giraudoux served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the Prix Blumenthal, a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians. In politics he was affiliated with the Radical Party, served in the cabinet of \u00c9douard Herriot in 1932, and was appointed as Minister of Information by \u00c9douard Daladier in 1939.

        "content": "Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi ( \u2013 May 17, 1510), known as Sandro Botticelli (, ), was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance.  Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th  century, when he was rediscovered by the Pre-Raphaelites who stimulated a reappraisal of his work. Since then, his paintings have been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting. In addition to the mythological subjects for which he is best known today, Botticelli painted a wide range of religious subjects (including dozens of renditions of the Madonna and Child, many in the round tondo shape) and also some portraits. His best-known works are The Birth of Venus and Primavera, both in the Uffizi in Florence. Botticelli lived all his life in the same neighbourhood of Florence; his only significant times elsewhere were the months he spent painting in Pisa in 1474 and the Sistine Chapel in Rome in 1481\u201382. Only one of Botticelli's paintings, the Mystic Nativity (National Gallery, London) is inscribed with a date (1501), but others can be dated with varying degrees of certainty on the basis of archival records, so the development of his style can be traced with some confidence.  He was an independent master for all the 1470s, which saw his reputation soar. The 1480s were his most successful decade, the one in which his large mythological paintings were completed along with many of his most famous Madonnas.  By the 1490s his style became more personal and to some extent mannered. His last works show him moving in a direction opposite to that of Leonardo da Vinci (seven years his junior) and the new generation of painters creating the High Renaissance style, and instead returning to a style that many have described as more Gothic or \"archaic.\""

        "content": "Botticelli was born in the city of Florence in a house in the street still called Borgo Ognissanti. He lived in the same area all his life and was buried in his neighborhood church called Ognissanti (\"All Saints\").  Sandro was one of several children to the tanner Mariano di Vanni d'Amedeo Filipepi, and the youngest of his four to survive into adulthood. The date of his birth is not known, but his father's tax returns in following years give his age as two in 1447 and thirteen in 1458, meaning he must have been born between 1444 and 1446. In 1460 Botticelli's father ceased his business as a tanner and became a gold-beater with his other son, Antonio. This profession would have brought the family into contact with a range of artists. Giorgio Vasari, in his Life of Botticelli, reported that Botticelli was initially trained as a goldsmith. The Ognissanti neighbourhood was \"a modest one, inhabited by weavers and other workmen,\" but there were some rich families, most notably the Rucellai, a wealthy clan of bankers and wool-merchants. The family's head, Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai, commissioned the famous Palazzo Rucellai, a landmark in Italian Renaissance architecture, from Leon Battista Alberti, between 1446 and 1451, Botticelli's earliest years. By 1458, Botticelli's family was renting their house from the Rucellai, which was just one of many dealings that involved the two families. In 1464, his father bought a house in the nearby Via Nuova (now called Via della Porcellana) in which Sandro lived from 1470 (if not  earlier) until his death in 1510. Botticelli both lived and worked in the house (a rather unusual practice) despite his brothers Giovanni and Simone also being resident there. The family's most notable neighbours were the Vespucci, including Amerigo Vespucci, after whom the Americas were named. The Vespucci were Medici allies and eventually regular patrons of Botticelli. The nickname Botticelli, meaning \"little barrel\", derives from the nickname of Sandro's brother, Giovanni, who was called Botticello apparently because of his round stature. A document of 1470 refers to Sandro as \"Sandro Mariano Botticelli\", meaning that he had fully adopted the name."

        "content": "From around 1461 or 1462 Botticelli was apprenticed to Fra Filippo Lippi, one of the leading Florentine painters and a favorite of the Medici.  It was from Lippi that Botticelli learned how to create intimate compositions with beautiful, melancholic figures drawn with clear contours and only slight contrasts of light and shadow. For much of this period Lippi was based in Prato, a few miles west of Florence, frescoing the apse of what is now Prato Cathedral. Botticelli probably left Lippi's workshop by April 1467, when the latter went to work in Spoleto. There has been much speculation as to whether Botticelli spent a shorter period of time in another workshop, such as that of the Pollaiuolo brothers or Andrea del Verrocchio. However, although both artists had a strong impact on the young Botticelli's development, the young artist's presence in their workshops cannot be definitively proven. Lippi died in 1469. Botticelli must have had his own workshop by then, and in June of that year he was commissioned a panel of Fortitude (Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi) to accompany a set of all Seven Virtues commissioned one year earlier from Piero del Pollaiuolo. Botticelli's panel adopts the format and composition of Piero's but features a more elegant and naturally posed figure and includes an array of \"fanciful enrichments so as to show up Piero's poverty of ornamental invention.\" In 1472 Botticelli took on his first apprentice, the young Filippino Lippi, son of his master. Botticelli and Filippino's works from these years, including many Madonna and Child paintings, are often difficult to distinguish from one another. The two also routinely collaborated, as in the panels from a dismantled pair of cassoni, now divided between the Louvre, the National Gallery of Canada, the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9 in Chantilly and the Galleria Pallavicini in Rome."

        "title": "Sandro Botticelli_Key early paintings",
        "content": "Botticelli's earliest surviving altarpiece is a large sacra conversazione of about 1470\u201372, now in the Uffizi. The painting shows Botticelli's early mastery of composition, with the figures  eight figures arranged with an \"easy naturalness in a closed architectural setting\". Another work from this period is the Saint Sebastian in Berlin, painted in 1474 for a pier in Santa Maria Maggiore, Florence. This work was painted soon after the Pollaiuolo brothers' much larger altarpiece of the same saint (London, National Gallery). Though Botticelli's saint is very similar in pose to that by the Pollaiuolo, he is also calmer and more poised. The almost nude body is very carefully drawn and anatomically precise, reflecting the young artist's close study of the human body. The delicate winter landscape, referring to the saint's feast-day in January, is inspired by contemporary Netherlandish painting, widely-appreciated in Florentine circles. At the start of 1474 Botticelli was asked by the authorities in Pisa to join the work frescoing the Camposanto, a large prestigious project mostly being done by Benozzo Gozzoli, who spent nearly twenty years on it.  Various payments up to September are recorded, but no work survives, and it seems that whatever Botticelli started was not finished.  Whatever the outcome, that Botticelli was approached from outside Florence demonstrates a growing reputation. The Adoration of the Magi for Santa Maria Novella (c. 1475\u201376, now in the Uffizi, and the first of 8 Adorations), was singled out for praise by Vasari, and was in a much-visited church, so spreading his reputation.  It can be thought of as marking the climax of Botticelli's early style.  Despite being commissioned by a money-changer, or perhaps money-lender, not otherwise known as an ally of the Medici, it contains the portraits of Cosimo de Medici, his sons Piero and Giovanni (all these by now dead), and his grandsons Lorenzo and Giuliano.  There are also portraits of the donor and, in the view of most, Botticelli himself, standing at the front on the right.  The painting was celebrated for the variety of the angles from which the faces are painted, and of their expressions. A large fresco for the customs house of Florence, that is now lost, depicted the execution by hanging of the leaders of the Pazzi conspiracy of 1478 against the Medici.  It was a Florentine custom to humiliate traitors in this way, by the so-called \"pittura infamante\". This was Botticelli's first major fresco commission (apart from the abortive Pisa excursion), and may have led to his summons to Rome.  The figure of Francesco Salviati, Archbishop of Pisa was removed in 1479, after protests from the Pope, and the rest were destroyed after the expulsion of the Medici and return of the Pazzi family in 1494. Another lost work was a tondo of the Madonna ordered by a Florentine banker in Rome to present to Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga; this perhaps spread awareness of his work to Rome.  A fresco in the Palazzo Vecchio, headquarters of the Florentine state, was lost in the next century when Vasari remodelled the building. In 1480 the Vespucci family commissioned a fresco figure of Saint Augustine for the Ognissanti, their parish church, and Botticelli's.  Someone else, probably the order running the church, commissioned Domenico Ghirlandaio to do a facing Saint Jerome; both saints were shown writing in their studies, which are crowded with objects.  As in other cases, such direct competition \"was always an inducement to Botticelli to put out all his powers\", and the fresco, now his earliest to survive, is regarded as his finest by Ronald Lightbown. The open book above the saint contains one of the practical jokes for which Vasari says he was known.  Most of the \"text\" is scribbles, but one line reads: \"Where is Brother Martino? He went out. And where did he go? He is outside Porta al Prato\", probably dialogue overheard from the Umiliati, the order who ran the church. Lightbown suggests that this shows Botticelli thought \"the example of Jerome and Augustine likely to be thrown away on the Umiliati as he knew them\"."

        "title": "Sandro Botticelli_Sistine Chapel",
        "content": "In 1481, Pope Sixtus IV summoned Botticelli and other prominent Florentine and Umbrian artists to fresco the walls of the newly completed Sistine Chapel.  This large project was to be the main decoration of the chapel. Most of the frescos remain but are greatly overshadowed and disrupted by Michelangelo's work of the next century, as some of the earlier frescos were destroyed to make room for his paintings. The Florentine contribution is thought to be part of a peace deal between Lorenzo Medici and the papacy.  After Sixtus was implicated in the Pazzi conspiracy hostilities had escalated into excommunication for Lorenzo and other Florentine officials and a small \"Pazzi War\". The iconographic scheme was a pair of cycles, facing each other on the sides of the chapel, of the Life of Christ and the Life of Moses, together suggesting the supremacy of the Papacy.  Botticelli's contribution included three of the original fourteen large scenes: the Temptations of Christ, Youth of Moses and Punishment of the Sons of Corah (or various other titles), as well as several of the imagined portraits of popes in the level above, and paintings of unknown subjects in the lunettes above, where Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling now is.  He may have also done a fourth scene on the end wall opposite the altar, now destroyed. Each painter brought a team of assistants from his workshop, as the space to be covered was considerable; each of the main panels is some 3.5 by 5.7 metres, and the work was done in a few months. Vasari implies that Botticelli was given overall artistic charge of the project, but modern art historians think it more likely that Pietro Perugino, the first artist to be employed, was given this role, if anyone was. The subjects and many details to be stressed in their execution were no doubt handed to the artists by the Vatican authorities.  The schemes present a complex and coherent programme asserting Papal supremacy, and are more unified in this than in their artistic style, although the artists follow a consistent scale and broad compositional layout, with crowds of figures in the foreground and mainly landscape in the top half of the scene.  Allowing for the painted pilasters that separate each scene, the level of the horizon matches between scenes, and Moses wears the same yellow and green clothes in his scenes. Botticelli differs from his colleagues in imposing a more insistent triptych-like composition, dividing each of his scenes into a main central group with two flanking groups at the sides, showing different incidents. In each the principal figure of Christ or Moses appears several times, seven in the case of the Youth of Moses. The thirty invented portraits of the earliest popes seem to have been mainly Botticelli's responsibility, at least as far as producing the cartoons went. Of those surviving, most scholars agree that ten were designed by Botticelli, and five probably at least partly by him, although all have been damaged and restored. The Punishment of the Sons of Corah contains what was for Botticelli an unusually close, if not exact, copy of a classical work.  This is the rendering in the centre of the north side of the Arch of Constantine in Rome, which he repeated in about 1500 in The Story of Lucretia. If he was apparently not spending his spare time in Rome drawing antiquities, as many artists of his day were very keen to do, he does seem to have painted there an Adoration of the Magi, now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington. In 1482 he returned to Florence, and apart from his lost frescos for the Medici villa at Spedaletto a year or so later, no further trips away from home are recorded.  He had perhaps been away from July 1481 to, at the latest, May 1482."

        "content": "The masterpieces Primavera (c. 1482) and The Birth of Venus (c. 1485) are not a pair, but are inevitably discussed together; both are in the Uffizi.  They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the Italian Renaissance.  As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity.  Together with the smaller and less celebrated Venus and Mars and Pallas and the Centaur, they have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations, the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism, and the identity of the commissioners and possible models for the figures. Though all carry differing degrees of complexity in their meanings, they also have an immediate visual appeal that accounts for their enormous popularity.  All show dominant and beautiful female figures in an idyllic world of feeling, with a sexual element. Continuing scholarly attention mainly focuses on the poetry and philosophy of contemporary Renaissance humanists. The works do not illustrate particular texts; rather, each relies upon several texts for its significance. Their beauty was characterized by Vasari as exemplifying \"grace\" and by John Ruskin as possessing linear rhythm.  The pictures feature Botticelli's linear style at its most effective, emphasized by the soft continual contours and pastel colors. The Primavera and the Birth were both seen by Vasari in the mid-16th century at the Villa di Castello, owned from 1477 by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, and until the publication in 1975 of a Medici inventory of 1499, it was assumed that both works were painted specifically for the villa. Recent scholarship suggests otherwise: the Primavera was painted for Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's townhouse in Florence, and The Birth of Venus was commissioned by someone else for a different site. Botticelli painted only a small number of mythological subjects, but these are now probably his best known works.  A much smaller panel than those discussed before is his Venus and Mars in the National Gallery, London.  This was of a size and shape to suggest that it was a spalliera, a painting made to fitted into either furniture, or more likely in this case, wood panelling.  The wasps buzzing around Mars' head suggest that it may have been painted for a member of his neighbours the Vespucci family, whose name means \"little wasps\" in Italian, and who featured wasps in their coat of arms.  Mars lies asleep, presumably after lovemaking, while Venus watches as infant satyrs play with his military gear, and one tries to rouse him by blowing a conch shell in his ear. The painting was no doubt given to celebrate a marriage, and decorate the bedchamber. Three of these four large mythologies feature Venus, a central figure in Renaissance Neoplatonism, which gave divine love as important a place in its philosophy as did Christianity.  The fourth, Pallas and the Centaur is clearly connected with the Medici by the symbol on Pallas' dress. The two figures are roughly life-size, and a number of specific personal, political or philosophic interpretations have been proposed to expand on the basic meaning of the submission of passion to reason. A series of panels in the form of an spalliera or cassone were commissioned from Botticelli by Antonio Pucci in 1483 on the occasion of the marriage of his son Giannozzo with Lucrezia Bini. The subject was the story of' Nastagio degli Onesti from the eighth novel of the fifth day of Boccaccio's Decameron, in four panels. The coats of arms of the Medici and the bride and groom's families appear in the third panel."

As with his secular paintings, many religious commissions are larger and no doubt more expensive than before. Altogether more datable works by Botticelli come from the 1480s than any other decade, and most of these are religious.  By the mid-1480s, many leading Florentine artists had left the city, some never to return.  The rising star Leonardo da Vinci, who scoffed at Botticelli's landscapes, left in 1481 for Milan, the Pollaiolo brothers in 1484 for Rome, and Andrea Verrochio in 1485 for Venice. The remaining leaders of Florentine painting, Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Filippino Lippi, worked on a major fresco cycle with Perugino, for Lorenzo the Magnificent's villa at Spedalletto near Volterra. Botticelli painted many Madonnas, covered in a section below, and altarpieces and frescos in Florentine churches. In 1491 he served on a committee to decide upon a fa\u00e7ade for the Cathedral of Florence, receiving the next year a small payment for a design for a scheme, eventually abortive, to put mosaics on some interior roof vaults in the cathedral."

        "content": "The first major church commission after Rome was the Bardi Altarpiece, finished and framed by February 1485, and now in Berlin. The frame was by no less a figure than Giuliano da Sangallo, who was just becoming Lorenzo il Magnifico's favourite architect.  An enthroned Madonna and (rather large) Child sit on an elaborately-carved raised stone bench in a garden, with plants and flowers behind them closing off all but small patches of sky, to give a version of the hortus conclusus or closed garden, a very traditional setting for the Virgin Mary. Saints John the Baptist and an unusually elderly John the Evangelist stand in the foreground. Small and inconspicuous banderoles or ribbons carrying biblical verses elucidate the rather complex theological meaning of the work, for which Botticelli must have had a clerical advisor, but do not intrude on a simpler appreciation of the painting and its lovingly detailed rendering, which Vasari praised. It is somewhat typical of Botticelli's relaxed approach to strict perspective that the top ledge of the bench is seen from above, but the vases with lilies on it from below. The donor, from the leading Bardi family, had returned to Florence from over twenty years as a banker and wool merchant in London, where he was known as \"John de Barde\", and aspects of the painting may reflect north European and even English art and popular devotional trends. There may have been other panels in the altarpiece, which are now missing."

Here the setting is a palatial heavenly interior in the latest style, showing Botticelli taking a new degree of interest in architecture, possibly influenced by Sangallo. The Virgin and Child are raised high on a throne, at the same level as four angels carrying the Instruments of the Passion.  Six saints stand in line below the throne.  Several figures have rather large heads, and the infant Jesus is again very large.  While the faces of the Virgin, child and angels have the linear beauty of his tondos, the saints are given varied and intense expressions.  Four small and rather simple predella panels survive; there were probably originally seven."

        "content": "With the phase of painting large secular works probably over by the late 1480s, Botticelli painted several altarpieces, and this appears to have been a peak period for his workshop's production of Madonnas. Botticelli's largest altarpiece, the San Marco Altarpiece (378 x 258\u00a0cm, Uffizi), is the only one to remain with its full predella, of five panels.  In the air above four saints, the Coronation of the Virgin is taking place in a heavenly zone of gold and bright colours that recall his earlier works, with encircling angels dancing and throwing flowers. In contrast, the Cestello Annunciation (1489\u201390, Uffizi) forms a natural grouping with other late paintings, especially two of the Lamentation of Christ that share its sombre background colouring, and the rather exaggerated expressiveness of the bending poses of the figures.  It does have an unusually detailed landscape, still in dark colours, seen through the window, which seems to draw on north European models, perhaps from prints. Of the two Lamentations, one is in an unusual vertical format, because, like his 1474 Saint Sebastian, it was painted for the side of a pillar in the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Florence; it is now in Milan.  The other, horizontal, one was painted for a chapel on the corner of Botticelli's street; it is now in Munich.  In both the crowded, intertwined figures around the dead Christ take up nearly all the picture space, with only bare rock behind.  The Virgin has swooned, and the other figures form a scrum to support her and Christ. The Munich painting has three less involved saints with attributes (somewhat oddly including Saint Peter, usually regarded as in Jerusalem on the day, but not present at this scene), and gives the figures (except Christ) flat halos shown in perspective, which from now on Botticelli often uses.  Both probably date from 1490 to 1495. Early records mentioned, without describing it, an altarpiece by Botticelli for the Convertite, an institution for ex-prostitutes, and various surviving unprovenanced works were proposed as candidates. It is now generally accepted that a painting in the Courtauld Gallery in London is the Pala delle Convertite, dating to about 1491\u201393.  Its subject, unusual for an altarpiece, is the Holy Trinity, with Christ on the cross, supported from behind by God the Father.  Angels surround the Trinity, which is flanked by two saints, with Tobias and the Angel on a far smaller scale right in the foreground.  This was probably a votive addition, perhaps requested by the original donor.  The four predella scenes, showing the life of Mary Magdalen, then taken as a reformed prostitute herself, are in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. After about 1493 or 1495 Botticelli seems to have painted no more large religious paintings, though production of Madonnas probably continued. The smaller narrative religious scenes of the last years are covered below."

        "title": "Sandro Botticelli_Madonnas, and tondos",
        "content": "Paintings of the Madonna and Child, that is, the Virgin Mary and infant Jesus, were enormously popular in 15th-century Italy in a range of sizes and formats, from large altarpieces of the sacra conversazione type to small paintings for the home.  They also often hung in offices, public buildings, shops and clerical institutions. These smaller paintings were a steady source of income for painters at all levels of quality, and many were probably produced for stock, without a specific commission. Botticelli painted Madonnas from the start of his career until at least the 1490s. He was one of the first painters to use the round tondo format, with the painted area typically some 115 to 145\u00a0cm across (about four to five feet).  This format was more associated with paintings for palaces than churches, though they were large enough to be hung in churches, and some were later donated to them. Several Madonnas use this format, usually with a seated Virgin shown down to the knees, and though rectangular pictures of the Madonna outnumber them, Madonnas in tondo form are especially associated with Botticelli.  He used the tondo format for other subjects, such as an early Adoration of the Magi in London, and was apparently more likely to paint a tondo Madonna himself, usually leaving rectangular ones to his workshop. Botticelli's Virgins are always beautiful, in the same idealized way as his mythological figures, and often richly dressed in contemporary style.  Although Savonarola's main strictures were against secular art, he also complained of the paintings in Florentine churches that \"You have made the Virgin appear dressed as a whore\", which may have had an effect on Botticelli's style.  They are often accompanied by equally beautiful angels, or an infant Saint John the Baptist (the patron saint of Florence).  Some feature flowers, and none the detailed landscape backgrounds that other artists were developing.  Many exist in several versions of varying quality, often with the elements other than the Virgin and Child different.  Many of these were produced by Botticelli or, especially, his workshop, and others apparently by unconnected artists.  When interest in Botticelli revived in the 19th century, it was initially largely in his Madonnas, which then began to be forged on a considerable scale. In the Magnificat Madonna in the Uffizi (118\u00a0cm or 46.5 inches across, c. 1483), Mary is writing down the Magnificat, a speech from the Gospel of Luke () where it is spoken by Mary upon the occasion of her Visitation to her cousin Elizabeth, some months before the birth of Jesus.  She holds the baby Jesus, and is surrounded by wingless angels impossible to distinguish from fashionably-dressed Florentine youths. Botticelli's Madonna and Child with Angels Carrying Candlesticks (1485/1490) was destroyed during World War II. It was stored in the Friedrichshain flak tower in Berlin for safe keeping, but in May 1945, the tower was set on fire and most of the objects inside were destroyed. Also lost were Botticelli's Madonna and Child with Infant Saint John and an Annunciation.<ref>\u201cMadonna and Child with Angels Carrying Candlesticks ; image</ref>"

        "content": "Botticelli painted a number of portraits, although not nearly as many as have been attributed to him.  There are a number of idealized portrait-like paintings of women which probably do not represent a specific person (several closely resemble the Venus in his Venus and Mars). Traditional gossip links these to the famous beauty Simonetta Vespucci, who died aged twenty-two in 1476, but this seems unlikely. These figures represent a secular link to his Madonnas. With one or two exceptions his small independent panel portraits show the sitter no further down the torso than about the bottom of the rib-cage.  Women are normally in profile, full or just a little turned, whereas men are normally a \"three-quarters\" pose, but never quite seen completely frontally.  Even when the head is facing more or less straight ahead, the lighting is used to create a difference between the sides of the face.  Backgrounds may be plain, or show an open window, usually with nothing but sky visible through it. A few have developed landscape backgrounds.  These characteristics were typical of Florentine portraits at the beginning of his career, but old-fashioned by his last years. Many portraits exist in several versions, probably most mainly by the workshop; there is often uncertainty in their attribution. Often the background changes between versions while the figure remains the same.  His male portraits have also often held dubious identifications, most often of various Medicis, for longer than the real evidence supports. Lightbown attributes him only with about eight portraits of individuals, all but three from before about 1475. Botticelli often slightly exaggerates aspects of the features to increase the likeness. He also painted portraits in other works, as when he inserted a self-portrait and the Medici into his early Adoration of the Magi. Several figures in the Sistine Chapel frescos appear to be portraits, but the subjects are unknown, although fanciful guesses have been made. Large allegorical frescos from a villa show members of the Tornabuoni family together with gods and personifications; probably not all of these survive but ones with portraits of a young man with the Seven Liberal Arts and a young woman with Venus and the Three Graces are now in the Louvre."

        "content": "Botticelli had a lifelong interest in the great Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, which produced works in several media. He is attributed with an imagined portrait. According to Vasari, he \"wrote a commentary on a portion of Dante\", which is also referred to dismissively in another story in the Life, but no such text has survived. Botticelli's attempt to design the illustrations for a printed book was unprecedented for a leading painter, and though it seems to have been something of a flop, this was a role for artists that had an important future. Vasari wrote disapprovingly of the first printed Dante in 1481 with engravings by the goldsmith Baccio Baldini, engraved from drawings by Botticelli: \"being of a sophistical turn of mind, he there wrote a commentary on a portion of Dante and illustrated the Inferno which he printed, spending much time over it, and this abstention from work led to serious disorders in his living.\" Vasari, who lived when printmaking had become far more important than in Botticelli's day, never takes it seriously, perhaps because his own paintings did not sell well in reproduction. The Divine Comedy consists of 100 cantos and the printed text left space for one engraving for each canto. However, only 19 illustrations were engraved, and most copies of the book have only the first two or three.  The first two, and sometimes three, are usually printed on the book page, while the later ones are printed on separate sheets that are pasted into place.  This suggests that the production of the engravings lagged behind the printing, and the later illustrations were pasted into the stock of printed and bound books, and perhaps sold to those who had already bought the book.  Unfortunately Baldini was neither very experienced nor talented as an engraver, and was unable to express the delicacy of Botticelli's style in his plates. Two religious engravings are also generally accepted to be after designs by Botticelli. Botticelli later began a luxury manuscript illustrated Dante on parchment, most of which was taken only as far as the underdrawings, and only a few pages are fully illuminated.  This manuscript has 93 surviving pages (32 x 47\u00a0cm), now divided between the Vatican Library (8 sheets) and Berlin (83), and represents the bulk of Botticelli's surviving drawings. Once again, the project was never completed, even at the drawing stage, but some of the early cantos appear to have been at least drawn but are now missing.  The pages that survive have always been greatly admired, and much discussed, as the project raises many questions.  The general consensus is that most of the drawings are late; the main scribe can be identified as Niccol\u00f2 Mangona, who worked in Florence between 1482 and 1503, whose work presumably preceded that of Dante.  Botticelli then appears to have worked on the drawings over a long period, as stylistic development can be seen, and matched to his paintings.  Although other patrons have been proposed (inevitably including Medicis, in particular the younger Lorenzo, or il Magnifico), some scholars think that Botticelli made the manuscript for himself. There are hints that Botticelli may have worked on illustrations for printed pamphlets by Savonarola, almost all destroyed after his fall."

        "content": "Botticelli became associated by historians with the Florentine School under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, a movement historians would later characterize as a \"golden age\".  The Medici family were effective rulers of Florence, which was nominally a republic, throughout Botticelli's lifetime up to 1494, when the main branch were expelled.  Lorenzo il Magnifico became the head of the family in 1469, just around the time Botticelli started his own workshop.  He was a great patron of both the visual and literary arts, and encouraged and financed the humanist and Neoplatonist circle from which much of the character of Botticelli's mythological painting seems to come.  In general Lorenzo does not seem to have commissioned much from Botticelli, preferring Pollaiuolo and others, although views on this differ. A Botticello who was probably Sandro's brother Giovanni was close to Lorenzo. Although the patrons of many works not for churches remain unclear, Botticelli seems to have been used more by Lorenzo il Magnifico's two young cousins, his younger brother Giuliano, and other families allied to the Medici.  Tommaso Soderini, a close ally of Lorenzo, obtained the commission for the figure of Fortitude of 1470 which is Botticelli's earliest securely dated painting, completing a series of the Seven Virtues left unfinished by Piero Pollaiuolo.  Possibly they had been introduced by a Vespucci who had tutored Soderini's son.  Antonio Pucci, another Medici ally, probably commissioned the London Adoration of the Magi, also around 1470. Giuliano de' Medici was assassinated in the Pazzi conspiracy of 1478 (Lorenzo narrowly escaped, saved by his bank manager), and a portrait said to be Giuliano which survives in several versions may be posthumous, or with at least one version from not long before his death. He is also a focus for theories that figures in the mythological paintings represent specific individuals from Florentine high society, usually paired with Simonetta Vespucci, who John Ruskin persuaded himself had posed nude for Botticelli."

        "content": "According to Vasari, Botticelli became a follower of the deeply moralistic Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola, who preached in Florence from 1490 until his execution in 1498: Botticelli was a follower of Savonarola's, and this was why he gave up painting and then fell into considerable distress as he had no other source of income.  None the less, he remained an obstinate member of the sect, becoming one of the piagnoni, the snivellers, as they were called then, and abandoning his work; so finally, as an old man, he found himself so poor that if Lorenzo de' Medici ... and then his friends and ... [others] had not come to his assistance, he would have almost died of hunger. The extent of Savonarola's influence on Botticelli remains uncertain; his brother Simone was more clearly a follower. The story, sometimes seen, that he had destroyed his own paintings on secular subjects in the 1497 bonfire of the vanities  is not told by Vasari.  Vasari's assertion that Botticelli produced nothing after coming under the influence of Savonarola is not accepted by modern art historians.  The Mystical Nativity, Botticelli's only painting to carry an actual date, if one cryptically expressed, comes from late 1500, eighteen months after Savonarola died, and the development of his style can be traced through a number of late works, as discussed below. In late 1502, some four years after Savonarola's death, Isabella d'Este wanted a painting done in Florence.  Her agent Francesco Malatesta wrote to inform her that her first choice, Perugino, was away, Filippino Lippi had a full schedule for six months, but Botticelli was free to start at once, and ready to oblige.  She preferred to wait for Perugino's return. This again casts serious doubt on Vasari's assertion, but equally he does not seem to have been in great demand. Many datings of works have a range up to 1505, though he did live a further five years. But Botticelli apparently produced little work after 1501, or perhaps earlier, and his production had already reduced after about 1495.  This may be partly because of the time he devoted to the drawings for the manuscript Dante. In 1504 he was a member of the committee appointed to decide where Michelangelo's David would be placed. Botticelli returned to subjects from antiquity in the 1490s, with a few smaller works on subjects from ancient history containing more figures and showing different scenes from each story, including moments of dramatic action. These are the Calumny of Apelles (c. 1494\u201395), a recreation of a lost allegory by the ancient Greek painter Apelles, which he may have intended for his personal use, and the pair of The Story of Virginia and The Story of Lucretia, which are probably from around 1500.The Mystical Nativity, a relatively small and very personal painting, perhaps for his own use, appears to be dated to the end of 1500. It takes to an extreme the abandonment of consistent scale among the figures that had been a feature of Botticelli's religious paintings for some years, with the Holy Family much larger than the other figures, even those well in front of them in the picture space. This may be seen as a partial reversion to Gothic conventions.  The iconography of the familiar subject of the Nativity is unique, with features including devils hiding in the rock below the scene, and must be highly personal. Another painting, known as the Mystic Crucifixion (now Fogg Art Museum), clearly relates to the state, and fate, of Florence, shown in the background behind Christ on the Cross, beside which an angel whips a marzocco, the heraldic lion that is a symbol of the city. This can be connected more directly to the convulsions of the expulsion of the Medici, Savonarola's brief supremacy, and the French invasion.  Unfortunately it is very damaged, such that it may not be by Botticelli, while it is certainly in his style. His later work, especially as seen in the four panels with Scenes from the Life of Saint Zenobius, witnessed a diminution of scale, expressively distorted figures, and a non-naturalistic use of colour reminiscent of the work of Fra Angelico nearly a century earlier.  Botticelli has been compared to the Venetian painter Carlo Crivelli, some ten years older, whose later work also veers away from the imminent High Renaissance style, instead choosing to \"move into a distinctly Gothic idiom\". Other scholars have seen premonitions of Mannerism in the simplified expressionist depiction of emotions in his works of the last years. Ernst Steinmann (d. 1934) detected in the later Madonnas a  \"deepening of insight and expression in the rendering of Mary's physiognomy\", which he attributed to Savonarola's influence (also pushing back the dating of some of these Madonnas.) More recent scholars are reluctant to assign direct influence, though there is certainly a replacement of elegance and sweetness with forceful austerity in the last period. Botticelli continued to pay his dues to the Compagnia di San Luca (a confraternity rather than the artist's guild) until at least October 1505; the tentative date ranges assigned to his late paintings run no further than this.  By then he was aged sixty or more, in this period definitely into old age. Vasari, who lived in Florence from around 1527, says that Botticelli died \"ill and decrepit, at the age of seventy-eight\", after a period when he was \"unable to stand upright and moving around with the help of crutches\". He died in May 1510, but is now thought to have been something under seventy at the time.  He was buried with his family outside the Ognissanti Church in a spot the church has now built over. This had been his parish church since he was baptized there, and contained his Saint Augustine in His Study."

Apart from the Dante illustrations, only a small number of these survive, none of which can be connected with surviving paintings, or at least not their final compositions, although they appear to be preparatory drawings rather than independent works.  Some may be connected with the work in other media that we know Botticelli did.  Three vestments survive with embroidered designs by him, and he developed a new technique for decorating banners for religious and secular processions, apparently in some kind of appliqu\u00e9 technique."

        "content": "In 1472 the records of the painter's guild record that Botticelli had only Filippino Lippi as an assistant, though another source records a twenty-eight-year old, who had trained with Neri di Bicci.  By 1480 there were three, none of them subsequently of note.   Other names occur in the record, but only Lippi became a well-known master. A considerable number of works, especially Madonnas, are attributed to Botticelli's workshop, or the master and his workshop, generally meaning that Botticelli did the underdrawing, while the assistants did the rest, or drawings by him were copied by the workshop. Botticelli's linear style was relatively easy to imitate, making different contributions within one work hard to identify, though the quality of the master's drawing makes works entirely by others mostly identifiable.  The attribution of many works remains debated, especially in terms of distinguishing the share of work between master and workshop.  Lightbown believed that \"the division between Botticelli's autograph works and the paintings from his workshop and circle is a fairly sharp one\", and that in only one major work on panel \"do we find important parts executed by assistants\"; but others might disagree. The National Gallery have an Adoration of the Kings of about 1470, which they describe as begun by Filippino Lippi but finished by Botticelli, noting how unusual it was for a master to take over a work begun by a pupil."

        "title": "Sandro Botticelli_Sexuality",
        "content": "Botticelli never married, and apparently expressed a strong dislike of the idea of marriage.  An anecdote records that his patron Tommaso Soderini, who died in 1485, suggested he marry, to which Botticelli replied that a few days before he had dreamed that he had married, woke up \"struck with grief\", and for the rest of the night walked the streets to avoid the dream resuming if he slept again.  The story concludes cryptically that Soderini understood \"that he was not fit ground for planting vines\". There has been over a century of speculation that Botticelli may have been homosexual. Many writers observed homo-eroticism in his portraits. The American art historian Bernard Berenson, for example, detected what he believed to be latent homosexuality. In 1938, Jacques Mesnil discovered a summary of a charge in the Florentine Archives for November 16, 1502, which read simply \"Botticelli keeps a boy\", an accusation of sodomy (homosexuality). No prosecution was brought. The painter would then have been about fifty-eight. Mesnil dismissed it as a customary slander by which partisans and adversaries of Savonarola abused each other. Opinion remains divided on whether this is evidence of bisexuality or homosexuality. Many have backed Mesnil. Art historian Scott Nethersole has suggested that a quarter of Florentine men were the subject of similar accusations, which \"seems to have been a standard way of getting at people\" but others have cautioned against hasty dismissal of the charge. Mesnil nevertheless concluded \"woman was not the only object of his love\". The Renaissance art historian, James Saslow, has noted that: \"His [Botticelli's] homo-erotic sensibility surfaces mainly in religious works where he imbued such nude young saints as Sebastian with the same androgynous grace and implicit physicality as Donatello's David\". He might have had a close relationship with Simonetta Vespucci (1453\u20131476), who has been claimed, especially by John Ruskin, to be portrayed in several of his works and to have served as the inspiration for many of the female figures in the artist's paintings. It is possible that he was at least platonically in love with Simonetta, given his request to have himself buried at the foot of her tomb in the Ognissanti the church of the Vespucci in Florence, although this was also Botticelli's church, where he had been baptized. When he died in 1510, his remains were placed as he requested."

        "title": "Sandro Botticelli_Later reputation",
        "content": "After his death, Botticelli's reputation was eclipsed longer and more thoroughly than that of any other major European artist. His paintings remained in the churches and villas for which they had been created, and his frescos in the Sistine Chapel were upstaged by those of Michelangelo. There are a few mentions of paintings and their location in sources from the decades after his death.  Vasari's Life is relatively short and, especially in the first edition of 1550, rather disapproving. According to the Ettlingers \"he is clearly ill at ease with Sandro and did not know how to fit him into his evolutionary scheme of the history of art running from Cimabue to Michelangelo\". Nonetheless, this is the main source of information about his life, even though Vasari twice mixes him up with Francesco Botticini, another Florentine painter of the day.  Vasari saw Botticelli as a firm partisan of the anti-Medici faction influenced by Savonarola, while Vasari himself relied heavily on the patronage of the returned Medicis of his own day.  Vasari also saw him as an artist who had abandoned his talent in his last years, which offended his high idea of the artistic vocation.  He devotes a good part of his text to rather alarming anecdotes of practical jokes by Botticelli.  Vasari was born the year after Botticelli's death, but would have known many Florentines with memories of him. In 1621 a picture-buying agent of Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua bought him a painting said to be a Botticelli out of historical interest \"as from the hand of an artist by whom Your Highness has nothing, and who was the master of Leonardo da Vinci\". That mistake is perhaps understandable, as although Leonardo was only some six years younger than Botticelli, his style could seem to a Baroque judge to be a generation more advanced. The Birth of Venus was displayed in the Uffizi from 1815, but is little mentioned in travellers' accounts of the gallery over the next two decades.  The Berlin gallery bought the Bardi Altarpiece in 1829, but the National Gallery, London only bought a Madonna (now regarded as by his workshop) in 1855. The English collector William Young Ottley bought Botticelli's The Mystical Nativity in Italy, bringing it to London in 1799. But when he tried to sell it in 1811, no buyer could be found. After Ottley's death, its next purchaser, William Fuller Maitland of Stansted, allowed it to be exhibited in a major art exhibition held in Manchester in 1857, the Art Treasures Exhibition, where among many other art works it was viewed by more than a million people.  His only large painting with a mythological subject ever to be sold on the open market is the Venus and Mars, bought at Christie's by the National Gallery for a rather modest \u00a31,050 in 1874. In 2013, his Rockefeller Madonna sold at Christie's for US$10.4 million. In 2021, the Portrait of a Young Man Holding a Roundel was sold at Sotheby's for USD92.2 million. The first nineteenth-century art historian to be enthusiastic about Botticelli's Sistine frescoes was Alexis-Fran\u00e7ois Rio; Anna Brownell Jameson and Charles Eastlake were alerted to Botticelli as well, and works by his hand began to appear in German collections. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood incorporated elements of his work into their own. Walter Pater created a literary picture of Botticelli, who was then taken up by the Aesthetic movement. The first monograph on the artist was published in 1893, the same year as Aby Warburg's seminal dissertation on the mythologies; then, between 1900 and 1920 more books were written on Botticelli than on any other painter. Herbert Horne's monograph in English from 1908 is still recognised as of exceptional quality and thoroughness, \"one of the most stupendous achievements in Renaissance studies\". Botticelli appears as a character, sometimes a main one, in numerous fictional depictions of 15th-century Florence in various media.  He will be portrayed by Sebastian de Souza in the second season of the TV series Medici: Masters of Florence. The main belt asteroid 29361 Botticelli discovered on 9 February 1996, is named after him."

Laporte built a number of wins, combined with 1 loss, including a 7-round knockout of Jean Lapointe. But he still was an unknown when given his first chance at a world championship on December 1980 in El Paso, Texas. He met legendary Mexican world Featherweight champion Salvador S\u00e1nchez there. Laporte made Sanchez work hard and won a handful of rounds. He lost to Sanchez by a 15-round unanimous decision. Laporte then fought future world champion Rocky Lockridge in 1981 at Las Vegas, scoring a second-round knockout to become the United States Featherweight champion. Given a second title shot, this time by the WBA, Laporte met the also legendary World featherweight champion Eusebio Pedroza in 1982, losing a close and controversial split decision. The fight was so close that WBC president Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n decided to give Laporte a rematch vs Sanchez for the World Boxing Council's world title. This rematch wasn't going to happen, because Sanchez died in a car accident the morning of August 12, in Mexico City. Then, the WBC decided to put Laporte vs. Colombian Mario Miranda for the vacant world title in a fight held at the Madison Square Garden. Laporte dropped Miranda in the eighth round and Miranda quit on his stool before the start of the 11th. Juan Laporte, the tough kid from New York who couldn't figure to become a world champ versus the legendary champions of the day, had become a world champion. Laporte defended his title twice, vs. Ruben Castillo and Johnny De La Rosa, both 12 rounds decision wins, then lost it to another Puerto Rican world champion, the legendary Wilfredo G\u00f3mez. In 1985, he went to Ireland, where he lost a ten-round decision to future world champion Barry McGuigan. In 1986, Laporte fought Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez at the Madison Square Garden, and many thought Laporte deserved the 12-round decision that night, but he lost a unanimous decision in a contest for Chavez's WBC world Jr. Lightweight title. His career went on and off after that day, and in 1989, his son died in a drowning accident. Laporte buried his title belt along with his son. Upon hearing this, Sulaiman sent him a new world title belt to show him support and respect from the boxing community. Around that era, on April 29, 1989, Laporte fought on the WBO's inaugural world Junior Lightweight championship bout, losing by a 12 rounds unanimous decision for the vacant title to his countryman, John John Molina, 18-2 before their fight, at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan. Laporte lost another disputed decision later on, this time to former world Jr Welterweight champion Billy Costello in 1999, and then finally retired from boxing."

        "content": "Emmet was born at 109 St. Stephen's Green, in Dublin on 4 March 1778. He was the youngest son of Dr Robert Emmet (1729\u20131802), physician to the Lord Lieutenant, and his wife, Elizabeth Mason (1739\u20131803). The Emmets were financially comfortable, members of the Protestant Ascendancy with a house at St Stephen's Green and a country residence near Milltown. Dr. Emmet supported the cause of American independence and was a well-known figure on the fringes of the Irish patriot movement. Theobald Wolfe Tone, a friend of Emmet's elder brother, Thomas Addis Emmet, and an advocate of more radical reform, including Catholic Emancipation, was a visitor to the house. So too, as a friend of his father, was Dr William Drennan, the original proposer of the \"benevolent conspiracy--a plot for the people\" that was to call itself, at Tone's suggestion, the Society of United Irishmen. Emmet entered Trinity College Dublin in October 1793 as a precocious fifteen-year-old and excelled as a student of history and chemistry. In December 1797 he joined the College Historical Society. His brother Thomas and Wolfe Tone, preceding him in the society, had maintained its lively tradition (stretching back to Edmund Burke) of defying the College's injunction against discussing questions of \"modern politics\". Fellow Society member Thomas Moore recalled that men \"of advanced standing and reputation for oratory, came to attend our debates, expressly for the purpose of answering [Robert] Emmet\". He eloquence was unmatched. Robert Emmet is described as slight in person; his features were regular, his forehead high, his eyes bright and full of expression, his nose sharp, thin, and straight, the lower part of his face slightly pock-marked, his complexion sallow."

        "content": "In April 1798 Emmet was expelled from Trinity. He had been exposed as the secretary of a secret college committee in support of the Society of United Irishmen of which his brother and Tone were leading executive members. Emmet did not participate in the disordered United Irish uprising when it broke out in counties to the south and north of a heavily-garrisoned Dublin in May 1798. But after the suppression of the rebellion in the summer, and in communication with state prisoners held at Fort George in Scotland (including his brother), Emmet joined William Putnam McCabe in re-establishing a United Irish organisation. They sought to reconstruct the Society on a strict military basis, with its members chosen personally by its officers' meeting as the executive directorate. Following the example not only of Tone but also of James Coigly, their aim was to again solicit a French invasion on the prospective strength both of a rising in Ireland and of a radical conspiracy in Britain. To this end McCabe set out for France in December 1798, stopping first in London to renew contact with the network of English Jacobins, the United Britons. On the new United Irish executive in Dublin, Emmet assisted veterans Thomas Wright (from April 1799, an informer) and Malachy Delaney (a former officer in the Austrian army), with a manual on insurgent tactics. In the summer of 1800, as secretary to Delaney, he set out on a secret mission to support McCabe's efforts in Paris. Through his foreign minister Talleyrand, Emmet and Delaney presented Napoleon with a memorial which argued that the parliamentary Union with Great Britain, imposed in the wake of the rebellion, had \"in no way eased the discontent of Ireland\", and with lessons drawn from the failure of '98, the United Irish were again prepared to act on the first news of a French landing. Their request for an invasion force almost double that commanded by Hoche in the aborted 1796 Bantry expedition possibly told against them. The First Consul had other priorities: securing a temporary respite from war (the treaties of Lun\u00e9ville in 1801 and of Amiens, March 1802) and re-enslaving Haiti."

        "content": "In January 1802 the arrival in Dublin of William Dowdall, following his release from Fort George, injected new life into the United Irishmen, and by March, contact was re-established with the United Britons network in England. In July, McCabe, returning to Paris from a visit to Dublin, brought news to Manchester that the United Irishmen were ready to rise again as soon as the continental war was renewed. In this expectation, preparations in England were intensified, including in London where Edward Despard sought to enlist in the republican conspiracy soldiers of the guards' regiment stationed at Windsor and the Tower of London.  In October, Emmet was dispatched from Paris to assist Dowdall with the Dublin preparations. In November 1802 the government moved on the conspirators in London. It did not discover the full extent of the plot, but the arrest of Despard and his execution in February 1803 may have weakened English support. Emmet's emissaries from Dublin found a cooler reception in the mill towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and in London than they had expected. In May 1803 the war with France was renewed. McCabe appeared to enjoy Napoleon's favour, and had had assurances of his intention to help Ireland secure her independence. From his own interviews with Napoleon, and with Talleyrand, in the autumn of 1802 Emmet emerged unconvinced. He was persuaded that the First Consul was considering a Channel crossing for August 1803, but that in the contest with England there would be scant consideration for Ireland's interests. (Sympathetic to the cause, Denis Taaffe proposed that if every France took possession of Ireland she would trade it for a West Indian sugar island). Disputing with Arthur O'Connor, who in Paris insisted on a guarantee of a French landing, when war was resumed Emmett sent his own emissary, Patrick Gallagher, to Paris, to ask for \"money, arms, ammunition and officers\" but not for large numbers of troops. After the rising in Dublin misfired, and with no further prospects at home, in August Emmet did send Myles Byrne to Paris to do all he could to encourage an invasion.  But at his trial, while he conceded that a \"connection with France was, indeed, intended\" it was to be \"only as far as mutual interest would sanction require\":  no man should \"calumniate\" his memory by believing that he had \"hoped for freedom from the government of France\". Michael Fayne, a Kildare conspirator, later testified that Emmet used talk of French assistance only to \"encourage the lower orders of people\", as he often heard him say that as bad as an English government was, it was better than a French one\", and that his object was \"an independent state brought about by Irishmen only\"."

        "content": "After his return to Ireland in October 1802, assisted by Anne Devlin (ostensibly his housekeeper), and with a legacy of \u00a32,000 left to him by his father, Emmet laid preparations for a rising. In April 1803, James (Jemmy) Hope and Myles Byrne arranged conferences, at which Emmet promised arms, with Michael Dwyer (Devlin\u2019s cousin), who still maintained a guerrilla resistance in the Wicklow Mountains, and with Thomas Cloney, a veteran of the Wexford rebellion in '98. Hope and Russell headed north to rouse the United veterans of Down and Antrim. In Dublin, Emmet believed his hand was forced on the 16th of July when gunpowder in the rebel arms depot in Patrick Street accidentally detonated, arousing the suspicion of the authorities. He persuaded the majority of the leadership, to bring forward the date for the rising to the evening of Saturday, July 23rd, a festival day, which would provide cover for the gathering of their forces. The plan, without any further consideration of French aid, was to storm Dublin Castle, make hostage of Privy Council, and signal the country to rise. According to the later recollection of Myles Byrne, on St Patrick's Day, 17 March 1803, gave a stirring speech to his confederates justifying the renewed resort to arms. If Ireland had cause in 1798, he argued it had only been compounded by the legislative union with Britain. As long as Ireland retained in its own parliament a \"vestige of self-government\", its people might entertain hope of representation and reform. But now \"in consequence of the accursed union\":[S]even-eights of the population have no right to send a member of their body to represent them, even in a foreign parliament, and the other eight part of the population are the tools and task masters, acting for the cruel English government and their Irish Ascendancy--a monster still worse, if possible than foreign tyranny."

Calling upon the Irish people \"to show the world that you are competent to take your place among the nations . . . as an independent country\", Emmet made clear in the proclamation that they would have to do so \"without foreign assistance\":  \"That confidence which was once lost by trusting to external support . . . has been again restored. We have been mutually pledged to each other to look only to our own strength\". The Proclamation also contained \"allusions to the widening of the political agenda of Emmet and the United Irishmen following the failure of 1798\". In addition to democratic parliamentary reform, the Proclamation announced that tithes were to be abolished and the land of the established Church of Ireland nationalised. This, it has been suggested, marked the influence upon Emmet of Thomas Russell, although as a radical campaigner for economic and social reform Russell might have wished to go further. Emmet remained intent on giving the rising a universal appeal across both class and sectarian divisions: \"We are not against property \u2013 we war against no religious sect \u2013 we war not against past opinions or prejudices \u2013 we war against English dominion.\" The Government sought to suppress all 10,000 printed copies of the Proclamation. Only two are known to survive."

        "content": "At 11 on the morning of the 23rd, Emmet showed men from Kildare an arsenal of pikes, grenades, rockets, and gunpower-packed hollowed beams (these were to be dragged out onto the streets to prevent cavalry charges).  They noted only the absence of recognisable firearms and left to turn back other Kildare insurgents on the road to Dublin. The plan to surprise Dublin Castle, and seize the viceroy, was botched when the assailants prematurely revealed themselves. By evening Emmet, Malachy Delaney and Myles Byrne (turned out for the occasion in gold-trimmed green uniforms) found themselves outside their Thomas Street arsenal with just 80 men. R.R. Madden describes \"a motley assemblage of armed men, a great number of whom were, if not intoxicated, under the evident excitement of drink\". Unaware that John Allen was approaching with a band, according to one witness, of 300, and shaken by the sight of a lone dragoon being pulled from his horse and piked to death, Emmet told the men to disperse. He had already stood down sizeable insurgent groups straddling the main suburban roads by pre-arranged signal, a solitary rocket. Sporadic clashes continued into the night. In one incident, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Lord Kilwarden, was dragged from his carriage and stabbed by pikes. Found still alive, he was taken to a watch-house where he died shortly thereafter. Kilwarden had used his position to help his cousin, Wolfe Tone, to avoid prosecution in 1794. He was nonetheless reviled for the prosecution and hanging of William Orr in 1797 and, in the wake of 1798, of several Catholic Defenders. Kilwarden's nephew, the Rev. Mr Wolfe, was also killed,  although his daughter was not harmed. Emmet fled the city arriving in Rathfarnham with party of 16 men. When he heard that Wicklowmen were still planning to rise, he issued a countermanding order to prevent needless violence Instead he ordered Byrne to Paris to again solicit the French."

        "content": "While Emmet hid in Rathfarnham, yeomen sought to extract information from Anne Devlin, prodding her with bayonets and half hanging her until she passed out. Had he not insisted on taking his leave of his fianc\u00e9e Sarah Curran (daughter of the disapproving John Philpot Curran) he may have succeeded in joining Dowdall and Byrne in France. Emmet was captured on 25 August and taken to the Castle, then removed to Kilmainham. Vigorous but ineffectual efforts were made to procure his escape. Emmet was tried and convicted for high treason on 19 September. The evidence against him had been overwhelming, but the Crown took the extra precaution of suborning his defence attorney, Leonard McNally, for \u00a3200 and a pension. McNally's assistant Peter Burrowes could not be bought and represented Emmet as best he could. Emmet's instruction, however, was not to offer a defence: he would not call any witnesses, \"or to take up the time of the court\". When on announcing this, McNally proposed that the trial was concluded, the prosecuting counsel William Plunket took to his feet. In what was widely regarded as an unnecessary attack on a doomed man, Plunket, who was to see himself appointed Solicitor-General, mocked Emmet as the deluded leader of a conspiracy encompassing \"the bricklayer, the old clothes man, the hodman and the hostler\". Emmet's Speech from the Dock is especially remembered for his closing remarks. Historian Patrick Geoghehan has identified over seventy different versions of the text, but in an early printing (1818) based on notes taken by Burrowes, Emmet concludes: I am here ready to die. I am not allowed to vindicate my character; no man shall dare to vindicate my character; and when I am prevented from vindicating myself, let no man dare to calumniate me. Let my character and my motives repose in obscurity and peace, till other times and other men can do them justice. Then shall my character be vindicated; then may my epitaph be written.Chief Justice Lord Norbury sentenced Emmet to be hanged, drawn and quartered, as was customary for conviction of treason.  The following day, 20 September, Emmet was executed in Thomas Street in front of St. Catherine's. He was hanged and then beheaded once dead. As family members and friends of Robert had also been arrested, including some who had nothing to do with the rebellion, no one came forward to claim his remains out of fear of arrest. On the eve of his execution, Emmet wrote from Kilmainham to the Chief Secretary for Ireland, William Wickham, whose \"fairness\" he acknowledged. He appears to have made a profound impression. In December Wickham resigned his post, confessing to friends that \"no consideration upon earth\" could induce him \"to remain after having maturely reflected\" on the contents of the note he had received. He could not enforce laws \"unjust, oppressive and unchristian\" and intolerable to the memory of a man he had been \"compelled by the duty of my office to pursue to the death\". Wickham was persuaded that Emmet had been attempting to save Ireland from \"a state of depression and humiliation\" and that, had he himself been an Irishman, he \"should most unquestionably have joined him\"."

        "content": "Emmet's remains were first delivered to Newgate Prison and then back to Kilmainham Gaol, where the jailer was under instructions that if no one claimed them they were to be buried in a nearby hospital's burial grounds called Bully's Acre. Family tradition has it that in 1804, under cover of the burial of his sister, Mary Anne Holmes, Emmet's remains were removed from Bully's Acre and re-interred in the family vault (since demolished) at St Peter's Church in Aungier Street. After searching for Emmet's grave in Dublin, early in 1812, Percy Bysshe Shelley revised his elegiac poem \u201cThe Monarch's Funeral: An Anticipation\u201d: \"For who was he, the uncoffined slain, /That fell in Erin's injured isle /Because his spirit dared disdain/ To light his country's funeral pile?\"  In \"On Robert Emmet's Grave\" Shelley proposed that, because unknown, Emmet's grave would \"remain unpolluted by fame /Till thy foes, by the world and by fortune caressed, /Shall pass like a mist from the light of thy name.\" When Shelley returned to London from Dublin in 1812, it was with an account of Emmet's trial containing his famous speech, and Emmet appears again as the \u201cpatriot\u201d in The Devil's Walk, a lengthy broadside against a corrupt and un-reforming government. (At the same time, while in Dublin, Shelley had gone round streets and pubs of the city handing out An Address, to the Irish People, a 22-page pamphlet in which he pleaded with the Irish people not to repeat Emmet's attempt:  \"I do not wish to see things changed now, because it cannot be done without violence, and we may assure ourselves that none of us are fit for any change, however good, if we condescend to employ force in a cause we think right\")."

        "content": "Emmet\u2019s rebellion infuriated Lord Castlereagh because he \"could not see the change that his own great measure the Union has effected in Ireland\".  Despite having so badly misfired, the 1803 rising suggested that the Act of Union was not going to be the palliative Castlereagh and Prime Minister William Pitt had intended. Castlereagh advised that \"the best thing would be to go into no detail whatever upon the case, to keep the subject clearly standing on its own narrow base of a contemptible insurrection without means or respectable leaders\", an instruction Plunket appears to have followed in Emmet's prosecution. This was to be a stance taken not only by unionists. Daniel O'Connell who was to lead the struggle for Catholic Emancipation and for repeal of the Union in the decades following Emmet's death, roundly condemned the resort to \"physical force\".  O'Connell's own programme of mobilising public opinion, fuelled by sometimes violent rhetoric and demonstrated in \"monster meetings\",  might have suggested that constitutionalism and physical force were complementary rather than antithetical. But O'Connell remained content with his dismissal of Emmett in 1803 as an instigator of bloodshed who had forfeited any claim to \"compassion\". Emmet's political rehabilitation begins in the Famine-years of the 1840s with the Young Irelanders. In 1846 they had finally broken with O'Connell declaring that if Repeal could not be carried by moral persuasion and peaceful means, a resort to arms would be \"a no less honourable course\". The Young Irelander publisher Charles Gavan Duffy repeatedly reprinted Michael James Whitty's popular chapbook Life, Trial and Conversations of Robert Emmet Esq. (1836), and promoted R.R. Madden's Life and Times of Robert Emmet (1847) which, despite its devastating account of the Thomas Street fiasco, was hagiographic. In carrying forward the tradition of physical-force republicanism from the debacle of the Young Irelander \"Famine Rebellion\" in 1848, the Irish Republican Brotherhood ( the Fenians) also carried forward admiration for Emmet. On the $20 bonds they issued in 1866 in the United States in the name of the Irish Republic, his profile appears opposite that of Tone. Robert Emmet's older brother, Thomas Addis Emmet emigrated to the United States shortly after Robert's execution. He eventually served as the New York State Attorney General. His descendants (who included the prominent American portrait painters Lydia Field Emmet, Rosina Emmet Sherwood, Ellen Emmet Rand, and Jane Emmet de Glehn) helped advance his standing among the Irish diaspora, which in turn may have been one factor in ensuring that he was one among the \"ghosts\" invoked in the run-up to 1916 Easter Rising. In the Emmet Commemoration speech he delivered in New York City in March 1914, Pearse described how the spirit of Irish patriotism called in Emmet \"to a dreamer\" and  \"awoke a man of action\"; called to \"a student and a recluse\" and brought forth \"a leader of men\"; \"called to one who loved the ways of peace\" and found \"a revolutionary\". Emmet was a man unwilling to \"surrender of one jot or shred of our claim to freedom even in return for all the blessings of the British peace\"."

        "content": "In a speech on Emmet in New York City in 1904, W. B. Yeats famously observed that \"Emmet died and became an image\". This was the work first, and foremost, of Thomas Moore. In his popular ballad \"O! Breathe Not His Name\", Moore made his former Trinity College friend the touchstone of national sentiment: \"Oh breathe not his name! let it sleep in the shade, / Where cold and unhonoured his relics are laid! [...] / And the tear we shed, though secret it rolls, Shall keep his memory green in our souls\". Dwelling upon the heartache of Sarah Curran, his \"She is Far From the Land Where Her Young Hero Sleeps\" also made Emmet an icon of romantic love. In Irish America where, together with Emmet's Speech from the Dock, \"O! Breathe Not His Name\" became part of the canon of parochial education, Moore had innumerable imitators. Of these, one of the most ambitious was John Boyle O'Reilly,a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood who had escaped from penal servitude in Western Australia. O'Reilly wrote a publicly performed eighty-four line poem, \"The Patriot's Grave\" (1878) in which he both echoes the defiance of Emmet's last words while attempting to bring the defence of physical force within a broader tradition that embraced constitutional agitation (to add Emmet to a Pantheon that included \"Grattan, Flood and Curran\"). Emmet was also a frequent character on the patriotic stage. Typical of his green-uniform presentation was Brandon Tynon's melodrama, Robert Emmet, the Days of 1803, which premiered on Broadway in 1902. In nineteenth century the Emmet story also found his way into prose. On both sides of the Atlantic John Doherty's 1836 Life, Trial and Conversation and Times of Robert Emmet, and R. R. Madden's 1844 Life and Time of Robert Emmet became the standard references. With less patience for historical or political background, what tended to be drawn out in subsequent works was the notion of  \"pure sacrifice\". In Robert Emmet, A Survey of his Rebellion and of His Romance (1904), Louise Imogen Guiney classes Emmet with Charlotte Corday and John Brown. In the early twentieth century, Moore's Emmet appeared in pioneering film. While focussed on the Emmet-Curran love story, the 1911Thanhouser film (USA) Robert Emmet depicts Emmet's expulsion from Trinity College, his meeting with Napoleon, his part in the rising and his capture, trial and execution. Some of the same storyline features in Ireland a Nation (1914) written and produced in London and Ireland by Walter MacNamara, and Sidney Olcott's  Bold Emmett Ireland's Martyr (1915, Sid Films, USA). Many decades later there was a step away from hagiography. In Pat Murphy\u2019s 1984 Irish drama film Anne Devlin there is implicit criticism of a patriotic politics that operates \"largely at the level of signs and representations\". In one scene, Emmet enters a room as Devlin his holding up his splendid green uniform in front of a mirror. Asked what she thinks of it, Devlin (cousin of the guerrilla leader Michael Dwyer) replies that it looks like a green version of an English Redcoat, and will be seen \"a mile off\". \"We should\", she argues, \"be rebel as ourselves\u2019\". Emmet is \"bold Robert\" in the song Back Home in Derry, written by Bobby Sands in HM Prison Maze before his fatal hunger strike in 1981. The lyrics, describing the feelings of rebels convicts as leave Ireland for Australia, were recorded by Christy Moore."

In boxing, he was nicknamed \"Big George\" and competed between 1967 and 1997. He is a two-time world heavyweight champion and an Olympic gold medalist. As an entrepreneur, he is known for the George Foreman Grill. After a troubled childhood, Foreman took up amateur boxing and won a gold medal in the heavyweight division at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Having turned professional the next year, he won the world heavyweight title with a stunning second-round knockout of then-undefeated Joe Frazier in 1973. He defended the belt twice before suffering his first professional loss to Muhammad Ali in the iconic Rumble in the Jungle in 1974. Unable to secure another title opportunity, Foreman retired after a loss to Jimmy Young in 1977. Following what he referred to as a religious epiphany, Foreman became an ordained Christian minister. Ten years later he announced a comeback, and in 1994 at age 45 won the unified WBA, IBF, and lineal heavyweight championship titles by knocking out 26-year-old Michael Moorer. He dropped the WBA belt rather than face his mandatory title defense soon after, and following a single IBF title defense on June 28, 1995, Foreman renounced his title \u2013 the last major belt he ever held. He was 46 years and 169 days old, becoming the oldest world heavyweight champion in history.  Foreman is the oldest to ever win the world heavyweight boxing championship of major honors, and the second-oldest in any weight class after Bernard Hopkins (at light heavyweight). He retired in 1997 at the age of 48, with a final record of 76 wins (68 knockouts) and 5 losses. Foreman has been inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame and International Boxing Hall of Fame. The International Boxing Research Organization rates Foreman as the eighth-greatest heavyweight of all time. In 2002, he was named one of the 25 greatest fighters of the past 80 years by The Ring. The Ring ranked him as the ninth-greatest puncher of all time. He was a ringside analyst for HBO's boxing coverage for 12 years until 2004. Outside boxing, he is a successful entrepreneur and known for his promotion of the George Foreman Grill, which has sold more than 100 million units worldwide. In 1999, he sold the commercial rights to the grill for $138 million."

In 1970, Foreman continued his march toward the undisputed heavyweight title, winning all 12 of his bouts (11 by knockout). Among the opponents he defeated were Gregorio Peralta, whom he decisioned at Madison Square Garden, although Peralta showed that Foreman was vulnerable to fast counter-punching mixed with an assertive boxing style. Foreman then defeated George Chuvalo by technical knockout (TKO) in three rounds. After this win, Foreman defeated Charlie Polite in four rounds and Boone Kirkman in three. Peralta and Chuvalo were Foreman's first world-level wins. Peralta was the number-10 ranked heavyweight in the world in January 1970 per The Ring, while Chuvalo was number seven in the world per their March 1971 issue. In 1971, Foreman won seven more fights, winning all of them by knockout, including a rematch with Peralta, whom he defeated by knockout in the 10th and final round in Oakland, California, and a win over Leroy Caldwell, whom he knocked out in the second round. After amassing a record of 32\u20130 (29 KO), he was ranked as the number-one challenger by the World Boxing Association and World Boxing Council."

        "content": "In 1972, still undefeated and with an impressive knockout record, Foreman was set to challenge undefeated and undisputed World Heavyweight Champion Joe Frazier. Despite boycotting a title elimination caused by the vacancy resulting from the championship being stripped from Muhammad Ali, Frazier had won the title from Jimmy Ellis and defended his title four times since, including a 15-round unanimous decision over the previously unbeaten Ali in 1971 after Ali had beaten Oscar Bonavena and Jerry Quarry. Despite Foreman's superior size and reach, he was not expected to beat Frazier and was a 3:1 underdog going into the fight. The Sunshine Showdown took place on January 22, 1973, in Kingston, Jamaica, with Foreman dominating the fight to win the championship by TKO. In ABC's rebroadcast, Howard Cosell made the memorable call, \"Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!\" Before the fight, Frazier was 29\u20130 (25 KO) and Foreman was 37\u20130 (34 KO). Frazier was knocked down six times by Foreman within two rounds (the three-knockdown rule was not in effect for this bout). After the second knockdown, Frazier's balance and mobility were impaired to the extent that he was unable to evade Foreman's combinations. Frazier managed to get to his feet for all six knockdowns, but referee Arthur Mercante eventually called an end to the one-sided bout. Foreman was sometimes characterized by the media as an aloof and antisocial champion. According to them, he always seemed to wear a sneer and was not often available to the press. Foreman later attributed his demeanor during this time as an emulation of Sonny Liston, for whom he had been an occasional sparring partner. Foreman defended his title successfully twice during his initial reign as champion. His first defense, in Tokyo, pitted him against Puerto Rican Heavyweight Champion Jos\u00e9 Roman. Roman was not regarded as a top contender, but had managed to beat a few decent fighters such as EBU champion Spain Jose Manuel Urtain, and was ranked the number-seven heavyweight in the March 1973 issue of The Ring. Foreman needed only two minutes to end the fight, one of the fastest knockouts in a heavyweight championship bout."

In 1974, in Caracas, Venezuela, he faced the highly regarded future hall-of-famer Ken Norton (who was 30\u20132), a boxer noted for his awkward crossed-arm boxing style, crab-like defense, and heavy punch (a style Foreman emulated in his comeback), who had broken the jaw of Muhammad Ali in a points victory a year earlier. Norton had a good chin and had performed well against Ali in their two matches, winning the first on points and nearly winning the second. (Norton developed a reputation for showing nerves against heavy hitters, largely beginning with this fight.)  After an even first round, Foreman staggered Norton with an uppercut a minute into round two, buckling him into the ropes.  Norton did not hit the canvas, but continued on wobbly legs, clearly not having recovered, and shortly he went down a further two times in quick succession, with the referee intervening and stopping the fight. \"Ken was awesome when he got going. I didn't want him to get into the fight\", Foreman said when interviewed years later. This fight became known as the \"Caracas Caper\". Foreman had cruised past two of the top names in the rankings. The win gave him a 40\u20130 record with 37 knockouts."

        "content": "Foreman's next title defense, on October 30, 1974 in Kinshasa, Zaire against Muhammad Ali, was historic. The bout, promoted as the \"Rumble in the Jungle\", exceeded even its wildest expectations. During training there in mid-September Foreman suffered a cut above his eye, forcing postponement of the match for a month. The injury affected his training regimen, as it meant he could not spar in the build-up to the fight and risk the cut being reopened. He later commented: \"That was the best thing that happened to Ali when we were in Africa\u2014the fact that I had to get ready for the fight without being able to box.\" Ali used this time to tour Zaire, endearing himself to the public, while taunting Foreman at every opportunity. Foreman was favored, having crushed undefeated heavyweight champion Joe Frazier and toppled formidable challenger Ken Norton both within two rounds. When Foreman and Ali finally met in the ring, Ali began more aggressively than expected, outscoring Foreman with superior punching speed. In the second round, Ali retreated to the ropes, shielding his head and hitting Foreman in the face at every opportunity. Foreman dug vicious body punches into Ali's sides; however, Foreman was unable to land many big punches to Ali's head. The ring ropes were unusually loose, and Foreman later charged that Angelo Dundee (Ali's longtime trainer) had loosened them as part of Ali's tactic to lean back and away from the wild swings before clinching Foreman behind the head; Dundee stated that not only did he tighten the ropes because they were so loose due to the heat, Ali came up with the \"rope-a-dope\" strategy entirely on his own. Ali had been known as a fighter of speed and movement, but the rope-a-dope technique worked exactly to plan, since Foreman had not had a fight that lasted past the fourth round since 1971. Ali continued to take heavy punishment to the body in exchange for the opportunity to land a hard jolt to Foreman's head. Ali later said he was \"out on his feet\" twice during the bout. As Foreman began to tire, his punches began to lose power and became increasingly wild. By mid-bout an increasingly confident Ali began to taunt the exhausted champion relentlessly, who had been reduced to mere pawing and landing harmless rubber-armed blows. Late in the eighth round Ali came off the ropes with a series of successively harder and more accurate right hooks to the side and back of Foreman's head, leaving him dazed and careening backwards.  After a lightning two-punch flurry squared him up, Ali ended the bout with a combination of solid left hook and straight right flush to the jaw that sent Foreman windmilling hard to the canvas, the first time he had been down in his career. Foreman later reflected, \"it just wasn't my night\". Foreman later also claimed he was drugged by his trainer prior to the bout. Though he sought a rematch with Ali, he was unable to secure one. In some quarters it was suggested Ali was ducking him, taking on low-risk opponents such as Chuck Wepner, Richard Dunn, Jean Pierre Coopman, and Alfredo Evangelista.  But Ali also fought formidable opponents, such as Ron Lyle, and gave rematches to the still-dangerous Frazier and Ken Norton, the only two men to have ever beaten him.  And Foreman clearly lost his edge after the dazing upset in Zaire.  Still, a potentially massive money-making encore with Foreman never happened, whatever the reason."

His first opponent was to be Ron Lyle, who had been defeated by Ali in 1975, via 11th-round TKO. Lyle was the number-five rated heavyweight in the world at the time per the March 1976 issue of the Ring. At the end of the first round, Lyle landed a hard right that sent Foreman staggering across the ring. In the second round, Foreman pounded Lyle against the ropes and might have scored a KO, but due to a timekeeping error, the bell rang with a minute still remaining in the round and Lyle survived. In the third, Foreman pressed forward, with Lyle waiting to counter off the ropes. In the fourth, a brutal slugfest erupted. A cluster of power punches from Lyle sent Foreman to the canvas. When Foreman got up, Lyle staggered him again, but just as Foreman seemed finished, he retaliated with a hard right to the side of the head, knocking down Lyle. Lyle beat the count, then landed another brutal combination, knocking Foreman down for the second time. Again, Foreman beat the count. Foreman said later that he had never been hit so hard in a fight and remembered looking down at the canvas and seeing blood. In the fifth round, both fighters continued to ignore defense and traded their hardest punches, looking crude. Each man staggered the other, and each seemed almost out on his feet. Then, as if finally tired, Lyle stopped punching, and Foreman delivered a dozen unanswered blows until Lyle collapsed to the canvas. Lyle remained down, giving Foreman a KO victory. The fight was named by The Ring as \"The Fight of the Year\"."

Because of the one-sided Foreman victory in their first fight, and the fact that Frazier had taken a tremendous amount of punishment from Ali in Manila a year earlier, few expected him to win. Frazier at this point was 32\u20133, having lost only to Foreman and Ali twice, and Foreman was 41\u20131, with his sole defeat at the hands of Ali. However, their rematch began competitively, as Frazier used quick head movements to make Foreman miss with his hardest punches. Frazier was wearing a contact lens for his vision, which was knocked loose during the bout. Unable to mount a significant offense, Frazier was eventually floored twice by Foreman in the fifth round and the fight was stopped. Next, Foreman knocked out Scott LeDoux in three rounds and prospect John Dino Denis in four to finish the year."

His opponent was the skilled boxer Jimmy Young, who had beaten Ron Lyle and lost a very controversial decision to Muhammad Ali the previous year. Foreman fought cautiously early on, allowing Young to settle into the fight. Young constantly complained about Foreman pushing him, for which Foreman eventually had a point deducted by the referee, although Young was never warned for his persistent holding. Foreman badly hurt Young in round seven, but was unable to land a finishing blow.

Although he did not formally retire from boxing, Foreman stopped fighting and became an ordained minister, initially preaching on street corners before becoming the reverend at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in Houston and devoting himself to his family and his congregation. He also opened a youth center that bears his name. Foreman continues to speak about his experience on Christian television broadcasts such as The 700 Club and the Trinity Broadcasting Network."

        "content": "In 1987, after 10 years away from the ring, Foreman surprised the boxing world by announcing a comeback at the age of 38. In his autobiography, he wrote that his primary motive was to raise money to fund the youth center he had created, which had required much of the money he had earned in the initial phase of his career. Another stated ambition was to fight Mike Tyson. For his first fight, he went to Sacramento, California, where he beat journeyman Steve Zouski by a knockout in four rounds. Foreman weighed  for the fight and looked badly out of shape. Although many thought his decision to return to the ring was a mistake, Foreman countered that he had returned to prove that age was not a barrier to people achieving their goals (as he said later, he wanted to show that age 40 is not a \"death sentence\"). He won four more bouts that year, gradually slimming down and improving his fitness. In 1988, he won nine times. Perhaps his most notable win during this period was a seventh-round knockout of former Light Heavyweight and Cruiserweight Champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi. Having always been a deliberate fighter, Foreman had not lost much mobility in the ring since his first \"retirement\", although he found keeping his balance harder after throwing big punches and could no longer throw rapid combinations. He was still capable of landing heavy single blows, however. The late-round fatigue that had plagued him in the ring as a young man now seemed to be unexpectedly gone, and he could comfortably compete for 12 rounds. Foreman attributed this to his new, relaxed fighting style (he has spoken of how, earlier in his career, his lack of stamina came from an enormous amount of nervous tension). By 1989, while continuing his comeback, Foreman had sold his name and face for the advertising of various products, selling everything from grills to mufflers on TV. For this purpose, his public persona was reinvented, and the formerly aloof, ominous Foreman had been replaced by a smiling, friendly George. Ali and he had become friends, and he followed in Ali's footsteps by making himself a celebrity outside boxing. Foreman continued his string of victories, winning five more fights, the most impressive being a three-round win over Bert Cooper, who went on to contest the undisputed heavyweight title against Evander Holyfield."

Very few boxing experts gave the 42-year-old Foreman a chance of winning. Foreman, who weighed in at 257 pounds, began the contest by marching forward, absorbing several of Holyfield's best combinations and occasionally landing a powerful swing of his own. Holyfield proved too tough and agile to knock down and was well ahead on points throughout the fight, but Foreman surprised many by lasting the full 12 rounds, losing his challenge on points. Round seven, in which Foreman knocked Holyfield off balance before being staggered by a powerful combination, was expected to be The Ring's \"Round of the Year\", though no award was given in 1991. A year later, Foreman fought journeyman Alex Stewart, who had previously been stopped in the first round by Mike Tyson. Foreman knocked down Stewart twice in the second round, but expended a lot of energy in doing so. He was subsequently tired, and Stewart rebounded.

Having lost his last fight against Morrison, Foreman was unranked and in no position to demand another title shot. His relatively high profile, however, made a title shot against Moorer, 19 years his junior, a lucrative prospect at seemingly little risk for the champion. Foreman's title challenge against Moorer took place on November 5 in Las Vegas, Nevada, with Foreman wearing the same red trunks he had worn in his title loss to Ali 20 years earlier. This time, however, Foreman was a substantial underdog. For nine rounds, Moorer easily outboxed him, hitting and moving away, while Foreman chugged forward, seemingly unable to \"pull the trigger\" on his punches. Entering the 10th round, Foreman was trailing on all scorecards. However, he launched a comeback in the 10th round and hit Moorer with a number of punches. Then, a short right hand caught Moorer on the tip of his chin, gashing open his bottom lip, and he collapsed to the canvas. He lay flat on the canvas as the referee counted him out. In an instant, Foreman had regained the title he had lost to Muhammad Ali two decades before. He went back to his corner and knelt in prayer as the arena erupted in cheers. With this historic victory, Foreman broke three records: He became, at age 45, the oldest fighter ever to win a world championship; 20 years after losing his title for the first time, he broke the record for the fighter with the longest interval between his first and second world championships; and the age spread of 19 years between the champion and challenger was the largest of any heavyweight boxing championship fight."

        "content": "Ag\u00e9nor Bardoux (15 January 1829, Bourges, Cher23 November 1897, Paris) was a French statesman and republican, son of Jacques Bardoux (Moulins, 3 February 1795Clermont-Ferrand, 8 January 1871) and wife Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Pignet (Limoges, 6 April 1807St. Saturnin, 25 March 1883). A native of Bourges, he was established as an advocate in Clermont-Ferrand, and did not hesitate to proclaim his Republican sympathies. In 1871 he was elected deputy of the French National Assembly, and re-elected in 1876 and in 1877. In the chamber he was president of the Centre gauche group, standing strongly for the republic but against anti-clericalism, and during the constitutional crisis of May 1877 he was one of the 363 signatories to the vote of no confidence. In the subsequently elected republican chamber he became minister of public instruction (December 1877) and proposed various republican laws, notably on compulsory primary education. He resigned in 1879. He was not re-elected in 1881 but in December 1882 was named senator for life. He married in Montpellier on 15 July 1873 Cl\u00e9mence Villa (Millau, 26 December 1847Paris, 2 December 1939), daughter of Achille Villa (Millau, 17 April 1818Millau, 7 April 1901) and wife Sophie Bimar (Montpellier, 13 October 1824Montpellier, 6 February 1885), by whom he had at least one son, the French senator and academic Jacques Bardoux. One of his descendants, Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing (born 1926) was president of France from 1974 until 1981."

        "content": "Jomo Kenyatta (22 August 1978) was a Kenyan anti-colonial activist and politician who governed Kenya as its Prime Minister from 1963 to 1964 and then as its first President from 1964 to his death in 1978. He was the country's first indigenous head of government and played a significant role in the transformation of Kenya from a colony of the British Empire into an independent republic. Ideologically an African nationalist and conservative, he led the Kenya African National Union (KANU) party from 1961 until his death. Kenyatta was born to Kikuyu farmers in Kiambu, British East Africa. Educated at a mission school, he worked in various jobs before becoming politically engaged through the Kikuyu Central Association. In 1929, he travelled to London to lobby for Kikuyu land affairs. During the 1930s, he studied at Moscow's Communist University of the Toilers of the East, University College London, and the London School of Economics. In 1938, he published an anthropological study of Kikuyu life before working as a farm labourer in Sussex during the Second World War. Influenced by his friend George Padmore, he embraced anti-colonialist and Pan-African ideas, co-organising the 1945 Pan-African Congress in Manchester. He returned to Kenya in 1946 and became a school principal. In 1947, he was elected President of the Kenya African Union, through which he lobbied for independence from British colonial rule, attracting widespread indigenous support but animosity from white settlers. In 1952, he was among the Kapenguria Six arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial Mau Mau Uprising. Although protesting his innocence\u2014a view shared by later historians\u2014he was convicted. He remained imprisoned at Lokitaung until 1959 and was then exiled to Lodwar until 1961. On his release, Kenyatta became President of KANU and led the party to victory in the 1963 general election. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the transition of the Kenya Colony into an independent republic, of which he became president in 1964. Desiring a one-party state, he transferred regional powers to his central government, suppressed political dissent, and prohibited KANU's only rival\u2014Oginga Odinga's leftist Kenya People's Union\u2014from competing in elections. He promoted reconciliation between the country's indigenous ethnic groups and its European minority, although his relations with the Kenyan Indians were strained and Kenya's army clashed with Somali separatists in the North Eastern Province during the Shifta War. His government pursued capitalist economic policies and the \"Africanisation\" of the economy, prohibiting non-citizens from controlling key industries. Education and healthcare were expanded, while UK-funded land redistribution favoured KANU loyalists and exacerbated ethnic tensions. Under Kenyatta, Kenya joined the Organisation of African Unity and the Commonwealth of Nations, espousing a pro-Western and anti-communist foreign policy amid the Cold War. Kenyatta died in office and was succeeded by Daniel arap Moi. Kenyatta was a controversial figure. Prior to Kenyan independence, many of its white settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, he was given the honorary title of Mzee and lauded as the Father of the Nation, securing support from both the black majority and the white minority with his message of reconciliation. Conversely, his rule was criticised as dictatorial, authoritarian, and neo-colonial, of favouring Kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of facilitating the growth of widespread corruption."

        "title": "Jomo Kenyatta_Childhood",
        "content": "A member of the Kikuyu people, Kenyatta was born with the name Kamau in the village of Nginda. Birth records were not then kept among the Kikuyu, and Kenyatta's date of birth is not known. One biographer, Jules Archer, suggested he was likely born in 1890, although a fuller analysis by Jeremy Murray-Brown suggested a birth circa 1897 or 1898. Kenyatta's father was named Muigai, and his mother Wambui. They lived in a homestead near the River Thiririka, where they raised crops, bred sheep and goats. Muigai was sufficiently wealthy that he could afford to keep several wives, each living in a separate ny\u016bmba (woman's hut). Kenyatta was raised according to traditional Kikuyu custom and belief, and was taught the skills needed to herd the family flock. When he was ten, his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition from childhood. Wambui subsequently bore another son, Kongo, shortly before Muigai died. In keeping with Kikuyu tradition, Wambui then married her late husband's younger brother, Ngengi. Kenyatta then took the name of Kamau wa Ngengi (\"Kamau, son of Ngengi\"). Wambui bore her new husband a son, whom they also named Muigai. Ngengi was harsh and resentful toward the three boys, and Wambui decided to take her youngest son to live with her parental family further north. It was there that she died, and Kenyatta\u2014who was very fond of the younger Muigai\u2014travelled to collect his infant half-brother. Kenyatta then moved in with his grandfather, Kongo wa Magana, and assisted the latter in his role as a traditional healer. In November 1909, Kenyatta left home and enrolled as a pupil at the Church of Scotland Mission (CSM) at Thogoto. The missionaries were zealous Christians who believed that bringing Christianity to the indigenous peoples of Eastern Africa was part of Britain's civilizing mission. While there, Kenyatta stayed at the small boarding school, where he learnt stories from the Bible, and was taught to read and write in English. He also performed chores for the mission, including washing the dishes and weeding the gardens. He was soon joined at the mission dormitory by his brother Kongo. The longer the pupils stayed, the more they came to resent the patronising way many of the British missionaries treated them. Kenyatta's academic progress was unremarkable, and in July 1912 he became an apprentice to the mission's carpenter. That year, he professed his dedication to Christianity and began undergoing catechism. In 1913, he underwent the Kikuyu circumcision ritual; the missionaries generally disapproved of this custom, but it was an important aspect of Kikuyu tradition, allowing Kenyatta to be recognized as an adult. Asked to take a Christian name for his upcoming baptism, he first chose both John and Peter after Jesus' apostles. Forced by the missionaries to choose just one, he chose Johnstone, the -stone chosen as a reference to Peter. Accordingly, he was baptized as Johnstone Kamau in August 1914. After his baptism, Kenyatta moved out of the mission dormitory and lived with friends. Having completed his apprenticeship to the carpenter, Kenyatta requested that the mission allow him to be an apprentice stonemason, but they refused. He then requested that the mission recommend him for employment, but the head missionary refused because of an allegation of minor dishonesty."

        "content": "Kenyatta moved to Thika, where he worked for an engineering firm run by the Briton John Cook. In this position, he was tasked with fetching the company wages from a bank in Nairobi,  away. Kenyatta left the job when he became seriously ill; he recuperated at a friend's house in the Tumutumu Presbyterian mission. At the time, the British Empire was engaged in the First World War, and the British Army had recruited many Kikuyu. One of those who joined was Kongo, who disappeared during the conflict; his family never learned of his fate. Kenyatta did not join the armed forces, and like other Kikuyu he moved to live among the Maasai, who had refused to fight for the British. Kenyatta lived with the family of an aunt who had married a Maasai chief, adopting Maasai customs and wearing Maasai jewellery, including a beaded belt known as kinyata in the Kikuyu language. At some point, he took to calling himself \"Kinyata\" or \"Kenyatta\" after this garment. In 1917, Kenyatta moved to Narok, where he was involved in transporting livestock to Nairobi, before relocating to Nairobi to work in a store selling farming and engineering equipment. In the evenings, he took classes in a church mission school. Several months later he returned to Thika before obtaining employment building houses for the Thogota Mission. He also lived for a time in Dagoretti, where he became a retainer for a local sub-chief, Kioi; in 1919 he assisted Kioi in putting the latter's case in a land dispute before a Nairobi court. Desiring a wife, Kenyatta entered a relationship with Grace Wahu, who had attended the CMS School in Kabete; she initially moved into Kenyatta's family homestead, although she joined Kenyatta in Dagoretti when Ngengi drove her out. On 20 November 1920 she gave birth to Kenyatta's son, Peter Muigui. In October 1920, Kenyatta was called before the Thogota Kirk Session and suspended from taking Holy Communion; the suspension was in response to his drinking and his relations with Wahu out of wedlock. The church insisted that a traditional Kikuyu wedding would be inadequate, and that he must undergo a Christian marriage; this took place on 8\u00a0November 1922. Kenyatta had initially refused to cease drinking, but in July 1923 officially renounced alcohol and was allowed to return to Holy Communion. In April 1922, Kenyatta began working as a stores clerk and meter reader for Cook, who had been appointed water superintendent for Nairobi's municipal council. He earned 250 shillings a month, a particularly high wage for a native African, which brought him financial independence and a growing sense of self-confidence. Kenyatta lived in the Kilimani neighbourhood of Nairobi, although he financed the construction of a second home at Dagoretti; he referred to this latter hut as the Kinyata Stores for he used it to hold general provisions for the neighborhood. He had sufficient funds that he could lend money to European clerks in the offices, and could enjoy the lifestyle offered by Nairobi, which included cinemas, football matches, and imported British fashions."

        "title": "Jomo Kenyatta_Kikuyu Central Association: 1922\u20131929",
        "content": "Anti-imperialist sentiment was on the rise among both native and Indian communities in Kenya following the Irish War of Independence and the Russian October Revolution. Many indigenous Africans resented having to carry kipande identity certificates at all times, being forbidden from growing coffee, and paying taxes without political representation. Political upheavals occurred in Kikuyuland\u2014the area inhabited largely by the Kikuyu\u2014following World War I, among them the campaigns of Harry Thuku and the East African Association, resulting in the government massacre of 21 native protesters in March 1922. Kenyatta had not taken part in these events, perhaps so as not to disrupt his lucrative employment prospects. Kenyatta's interest in politics stemmed from his friendship with James Beauttah, a senior figure in the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA). Beauttah took Kenyatta to a political meeting in Pumwani, although this led to no firm involvement at the time. In either 1925 or early 1926, Beauttah moved to Uganda, but remained in contact with Kenyatta. When the KCA wrote to Beauttah and asked him to travel to London as their representative, he declined, but recommended that Kenyatta\u2014who had a good command of English\u2014go in his place. Kenyatta accepted, probably on the condition that the Association matched his pre-existing wage. He thus became the group's secretary. It is likely that the KCA purchased a motorbike for Kenyatta, which he used to travel around Kikuyuland and neighbouring areas inhabited by the Meru and Embu, helping to establish new KCA branches. In February 1928, he was part of a KCA party that visited Government House in Nairobi to give evidence in front of the Hilton Young Commission, which was then considering a federation between Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika. In June, he was part of a KCA team which appeared before a select committee of the Kenyan Legislative Council to express concerns about the recent introduction of Land Boards. Introduced by the British Governor of Kenya, Edward Grigg, these Land Boards would hold all land in native reserves in trust for each tribal group. Both the KCA and the Kikuyu Association opposed these Land Boards, which treated Kikuyu land as collectively-owned rather than recognising individual Kikuyu land ownership. Also in February, his daughter, Wambui Margaret, was born. By this point he was increasingly using the name \"Kenyatta\", which had a more African appearance than \"Johnstone\". In May 1928, the KCA launched a Kikuyu-language magazine, Mu\u0129gwithania (roughly translated as \"The Reconciler\" or \"The Unifier\"), in which it published news, articles, and homilies. Its purpose was to help unify the Kikuyu and raise funds for the KCA. Kenyatta was listed as the publication's editor, although Murray-Brown suggested that he was not the guiding hand behind it and that his duties were largely confined to translating into Kikuyu. Aware that Thuku had been exiled for his activism, Kenyatta's took a cautious approach to campaigning, and in Mu\u0129gwithania he expressed support for the churches, district commissioners, and chiefs. He also praised the British Empire, stating that: \"The first thing [about the Empire] is that all people are governed justly, big or small\u2014equally. The second thing is that nobody is regarded as a slave, everyone is free to do what he or she likes without being hindered.\" This did not prevent Grigg from writing to the authorities in London requesting permission to shut the magazine down."

        "content": "After the KCA raised sufficient funds, in February 1929 Kenyatta sailed from Mombasa to Britain. Grigg's administration could not stop Kenyatta's journey but asked London's Colonial Office not to meet with him. He initially stayed at the West African Students' Union premises in West London, where he met Ladipo Solanke. He then lodged with a prostitute; both this and Kenyatta's lavish spending brought concern from the Church Mission Society. His landlord subsequently impounded his belongings due to unpaid debt. In the city, Kenyatta met with W. McGregor Ross at the Royal Empire Society, Ross briefing him on how to deal with the Colonial Office. Kenyatta became friends with Ross' family, and accompanied them to social events in Hampstead. He also contacted anti-imperialists active in Britain, including the League Against Imperialism, Fenner Brockway, and Kingsley Martin. Grigg was in London at the same time and, despite his opposition to Kenyatta's visit, agreed to meet with him at the Rhodes Trust headquarters in April. At the meeting, Kenyatta raised the land issue and Thuku's exile, the atmosphere between the two being friendly. In spite of this, following the meeting, Grigg convinced Special Branch to monitor Kenyatta. Kenyatta developed contacts with radicals to the left of the Labour Party, including several communists. In the summer of 1929, he left London and traveled by Berlin to Moscow before returning to London in October. Kenyatta was strongly influenced by his time in the Soviet Union. Back in England, he wrote three articles on the Kenyan situation for the Communist Party of Great Britain's newspapers, the Daily Worker and Sunday Worker. In these, his criticism of British imperialism was far stronger than it had been in Mu\u0129gwithania. These communist links concerned many of Kenyatta's liberal patrons. In January, Kenyatta met with Drummond Shiels, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, at the House of Commons. Kenyatta told Shiels that he was not affiliated with communist circles and was unaware of the nature of the newspaper which published his articles. Shiels advised Kenyatta to return home to promote Kikuyu involvement in the constitutional process and discourage violence and extremism. After eighteen months in Europe, Kenyatta had run out of money. The Anti-Slavery Society advanced him funds to pay off his debts and return to Kenya. Although Kenyatta enjoyed life in London and feared arrest if he returned home, he sailed back to Mombasa in September 1930. On his return, his prestige among the Kikuyu was high because of his time spent in Europe. In his absence, female genital mutilation (FGM) had become a topic of strong debate in Kikuyu society. The Protestant churches, backed by European medics and the colonial authorities, supported the abolition of this traditional practice, but the KCA rallied to its defence, claiming that its abolition would damage the structure of Kikuyu society. Anger between the two sides had heightened, several churches expelling KCA members from their congregations, and it was widely believed that the January 1930 killing of an American missionary, Hulda Stumpf, had been due to the issue. As Secretary of the KCA, Kenyatta met with church representatives. He expressed the view that although personally opposing FGM, he regarded its legal abolition as counter-productive, and argued that the churches should focus on eradicating the practice through educating people about its harmful effects on women's health. The meeting ended without compromise, and John Arthur\u2014the head of the Church of Scotland in Kenya\u2014later expelled Kenyatta from the church, citing what he deemed dishonesty during the debate. In 1931, Kenyatta took his son out of the church school at Thogota and enrolled him in a KCA-approved, independent school."

        "content": "In May 1931, Kenyatta and Parmenas Mockerie sailed for Britain, intent on representing the KCA at a Joint Committee of Parliament on the future of East Africa. Kenyatta would not return to Kenya for fifteen years. In Britain, he spent the summer attending an Independent Labour Party summer school and Fabian Society gatherings. In June, he visited Geneva, Switzerland to attend a Save the Children conference on African children. In November, he met the Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi while in London. That month, he enrolled in the Woodbrooke Quaker College in Birmingham, where he remained until the spring of 1932, attaining a certificate in English writing. In Britain, Kenyatta befriended an Afro-Caribbean Marxist, George Padmore, who was working for the Soviet-run Comintern. Over time, he became Padmore's prot\u00e9g\u00e9. In late 1932, he joined Padmore in Germany. Before the end of the year, the duo relocated to Moscow, where Kenyatta studied at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East. There he was taught arithmetic, geography, natural science, and political economy, as well as Marxist-Leninist doctrine and the history of the Marxist-Leninist movement. Many Africans and members of the African diaspora were attracted to the institution because it offered free education and the opportunity to study in an environment where they were treated with dignity, free from the institutionalised racism present in the U.S. and British Empire. Kenyatta complained about the food, accommodation, and poor quality of English instruction. There is no evidence that he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and one of his fellow students later characterised him as \"the biggest reactionary I have ever met.\" Kenyatta also visited Siberia, probably as part of an official guided tour. The emergence of Germany's Nazi government shifted political allegiances in Europe; the Soviet Union pursued formal alliances with France and Czechoslovakia, and thus reduced its support for the movement against British and French colonial rule in Africa. As a result, Comintern disbanded the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers, with which both Padmore and Kenyatta were affiliated. Padmore resigned from the Soviet Communist Party in protest, and was subsequently vilified in the Soviet press. Both Padmore and Kenyatta left the Soviet Union, the latter returning to London in August 1933. The British authorities were highly suspicious of Kenyatta's time in the Soviet Union, suspecting that he was a Marxist-Leninist, and following his return the MI5 intelligence service intercepted and read all his mail. Kenyatta continued writing articles, reflecting Padmore's influence. Between 1931 and 1937 he wrote several articles for the Negro Worker and joined the newspaper's editorial board in 1933. He also produced an article for a November 1933 issue of Labour Monthly, and in May 1934 had a letter published in The Manchester Guardian. He also wrote the entry on Kenya for Negro, an anthology edited by Nancy Cunard and published in 1934. In these, he took a more radical position than he had in the past, calling for complete self-rule in Kenya. In doing so he was virtually alone among political Kenyans; figures like Thuku and Jesse Kariuki were far more moderate in their demands. The pro-independence sentiments that he was able to express in Britain would not have been permitted in Kenya itself."

        "content": "Between 1935 and 1937, Kenyatta worked as a linguistic informant for the Phonetics Department at University College London (UCL); his Kikuyu voice recordings assisted Lilias Armstrong's production of The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu. The book was published under Armstrong's name, although Kenyatta claimed he should have been listed as co-author. He enrolled at UCL as a student, studying an English course between January and July 1935 and then a phonetics course from October 1935 to June 1936. Enabled by a grant from the International African Institute, he also took a social anthropology course under Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski at the London School of Economics (LSE). Kenyatta lacked the qualifications normally required to join the course, but Malinowski was keen to support the participation of indigenous peoples in anthropological research. For Kenyatta, acquiring an advanced degree would bolster his status among Kenyans and display his intellectual equality with white Europeans in Kenya. Over the course of his studies, Kenyatta and Malinowski became close friends. Fellow course-mates included the anthropologists Audrey Richards, Lucy Mair, and Elspeth Huxley. Another of his fellow LSE students was Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark, who invited Kenyatta to stay with him and his mother, Princess Marie Bonaparte, in Paris during the spring of 1936. Kenyatta returned to his former dwellings at 95 Cambridge Street, but did not pay his landlady for over a year, owing over \u00a3100 in rent. This angered Ross and contributed to the breakdown of their friendship. He then rented a Camden Town flat with his friend Dinah Stock, whom he met at an anti-imperialist rally in Trafalgar Square. Kenyatta socialised at the Student Movement House in Russell Square, which he had joined in the spring of 1934, and befriended Africans in the city. To earn money, he worked as one of 250 black extras in the film Sanders of the River, filmed at Shepperton Studios in Autumn 1934. Several other Africans in London criticized him for doing so, arguing that the film degraded black people. Appearing in the film also allowed him to meet and befriend its star, the African-American Paul Robeson. In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia (Abyssinia), incensing Kenyatta and other Africans in London; he became the honorary secretary of the International African Friends of Abyssinia, a group established by Padmore and C. L. R. James. When Ethiopia's monarch Haile Selassie fled to London in exile, Kenyatta personally welcomed him at Waterloo station. This group developed into a wider pan-Africanist organisation, the International African Service Bureau (IASB), of which Kenyatta became one of the vice chairs. Kenyatta began giving anti-colonial lectures across Britain for groups like the IASB, the Workers' Educational Association, Indian National Congress of Great Britain, and the League of Coloured Peoples. In October 1938, he gave a talk to the Manchester Fabian Society in which he described British colonial policy as fascism and compared the treatment of indigenous people in East Africa to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. In response to these activities, the British Colonial Office reopened their file on him, although could not find any evidence that he was engaged in anything sufficiently seditious to warrant prosecution. Kenyatta assembled the essays on Kikuyu society written for Malinowski's class and published them as Facing Mount Kenya in 1938. Featuring an introduction written by Malinowski, the book reflected Kenyatta's desire to use anthropology as a weapon against colonialism. In it, Kenyatta challenged the Eurocentric view of history by presenting an image of a golden African past by emphasising the perceived order, virtue, and self-sufficiency of Kikuyu society. Utilising a functionalist framework, he promoted the idea that traditional Kikuyu society had a cohesion and integrity that was better than anything offered by European colonialism. In this book, Kenyatta made clear his belief that the rights of the individual should be downgraded in favour of the interests of the group. The book also reflected his changing views on female genital mutilation; where once he opposed it, he now unequivocally supported the practice, downplaying the medical dangers that it posed to women. The book's jacket cover featured an image of Kenyatta in traditional dress, wearing a skin cloak over one shoulder and carrying a spear. The book was published under the name \"Jomo Kenyatta\", the first time that he had done so; the term Jomo was close to a Kikuyu word describing the removal of a sword from its scabbard. Facing Mount Kenya was a commercial failure, selling only 517 copies, but was generally well received; an exception was among white Kenyans, whose assumptions about the Kikuyu being primitive savages in need of European civilization it challenged. Murray-Brown later described it as \"a propaganda tour de force. No other African had made such an uncompromising stand for tribal integrity.\" Bodil Folke Frederiksen, a scholar of development studies, referred to it as \"probably the most well-known and influential African scholarly work of its time\", while for fellow scholar Simon Gikandi, it was \"one of the major texts in what has come to be known as the invention of tradition in colonial Africa\"."

Kenyatta remained there for the duration of the war, renting a flat and a small plot of land to grow vegetables and raise chickens. He settled into rural Sussex life, and became a regular at the village pub, where he gained the nickname \"Jumbo\". In August 1940, he took a job at a local farm as an agricultural worker\u2014allowing him to evade military conscription\u2014before working in the tomato greenhouses at Lindfield. He attempted to join the local Home Guard, but was turned down. On 11 May 1942 he married an English woman, Edna Grace Clarke, at Chanctonbury Registry Office. In August 1943, their son, Peter Magana, was born. Intelligence services continued monitoring Kenyatta, noting that he was politically inactive between 1939 and 1944. In Sussex, he wrote an essay for the United Society for Christian Literature, My People of Kikuyu and the Life of Chief Wangombe, in which he called for his tribe's political independence. He also began\u2014although never finished\u2014a novel partly based on his life experiences. He continued to give lectures around the country, including to groups of East African soldiers stationed in Britain. He became frustrated by the distance between him and Kenya, telling Edna that he felt \"like a general separated by 5000 miles from his troops\". While he was absent, Kenya's authorities banned the KCA in 1940. Kenyatta and other senior IASB members began planning the fifth Pan-African Congress, held in Manchester in October 1945. They were assisted by Kwame Nkrumah, a Gold Coast (Ghanaian) who arrived in Britain earlier that year. Kenyatta spoke at the conference, although made no particular impact on the proceedings. Much of the debate that took place centred on whether indigenous Africans should continue pursuing a gradual campaign for independence or whether they should seek the military overthrow of the European imperialists. The conference ended with a statement declaring that while delegates desired a peaceful transition to African self-rule, Africans \"as a last resort, may have to appeal to force in the effort to achieve Freedom\". Kenyatta supported this resolution, although was more cautious than other delegates and made no open commitment to violence. He subsequently authored an IASB pamphlet, Kenya: The Land of Conflict, in which he blended political calls for independence with romanticised descriptions of an idealised pre-colonial African past."

        "content": "After British victory in World War II, Kenyatta received a request to return to Kenya in September 1946, sailing back that month. He decided not to bring Edna\u2014who was pregnant with a second child\u2014with him, aware that if they joined him in Kenya their lives would be made very difficult by the colony's racial laws. On his arrival in Mombasa, Kenyatta was greeted by his first wife, Grace Wahu and their children. He built a bungalow at Gatundu, near to where he was born, and began farming his 32-acre estate. Kenyatta met with the new Governor of Kenya, Philip Euen Mitchell, and in March 1947 accepted a post on an African Land Settlement Board, holding the post for two years. He also met with Mbiyu Koinange to discuss the future of the Koinange Independent Teachers' College in Githungui, Koinange appointing Kenyatta as its Vice-Principal. In May 1947, Koinange moved to England, leaving Kenyatta to take full control of the college. Under Kenyatta's leadership, additional funds were raised for the construction of school buildings and the number of boys in attendance rose from 250 to 900. It was also beset with problems, including a decline in standards and teachers' strikes over non-payment of wages. Gradually, the number of enrolled pupils fell. Kenyatta built a friendship with Koinange's father, a Senior Chief, who gave Kenyatta one of his daughters to take as his third wife. She bore him another child, but later died in childbirth. In 1951, he married his fourth wife, Ngina, who was one of the few female students at his college; she then gave birth to a daughter. In August 1944, the Kenya African Union (KAU) had been founded; at that time it was the only active political outlet for indigenous Africans in the colony. At its June 1947 annual general meeting, KAU's President James Gichuru stepped down and Kenyatta was elected as his replacement. Kenyatta began to draw large crowds wherever he travelled in Kikuyuland, and Kikuyu press began describing him as the \"Saviour\", \"Great Elder\", and \"Hero of Our Race\". He was nevertheless aware that to achieve independence, KAU needed the support of other indigenous tribes and ethnic groups. This was made difficult by the fact that many Maasai and Luo\u2014tribes traditionally hostile to the Kikuyu\u2014regarded him as an advocate of Kikuyu dominance. He insisted on intertribal representation on the KAU executive and ensured that party business was conducted in Swahili, the lingua franca of indigenous Kenyans. To attract support from Kenya's Indian community, he made contact with Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the new Indian republic. Nehru's response was supportive, sending a message to Kenya's Indian minority reminding them that they were the guests of the indigenous African population. Relations with the white minority remained strained; for most white Kenyans, Kenyatta was their principal enemy, an agitator with links to the Soviet Union who had the impertinence to marry a white woman. They too increasingly called for further Kenyan autonomy from the British government, but wanted continued white-minority rule and closer links to the white-minority governments of South Africa, Northern Rhodesia, and Southern Rhodesia; they viewed Britain's newly elected Labour government with great suspicion. The white Electors' Union put forward a \"Kenya Plan\" which proposed greater white settlement in Kenya, bringing Tanganyika into the British Empire, and incorporating it within their new British East African Dominion. In April 1950, Kenyatta was present at a joint meeting of KAU and the East African Indian National Congress in which they both expressed opposition to the Kenya Plan. By 1952, Kenyatta was widely recognized as a national leader, both by his supporters and by his opponents. As KAU leader, he was at pains to oppose all illegal activity, including workers' strikes. He called on his supporters to work hard, and to abandon laziness, theft, and crime. He also insisted that in an independent Kenya, all racial groups would be safeguarded. Kenyatta's gradualist and peaceful approach contrasted with the growth of the Mau Mau Uprising, as armed guerrilla groups began targeting the white minority and members of the Kikuyu community who did not support them. By 1959, the Mau Mau had killed around 1,880 people. For many young Mau Mau militants, Kenyatta was regarded as a hero, and they included his name in the oaths they gave to the organisation; such oathing was a Kikuyu custom by which individuals pledged allegiance to another. Kenyatta publicly distanced himself from the Mau Mau. In April 1952, he began a speaking tour in which he denounced the Mau Mau to assembled crowds, insisting that independence must be achieved through peaceful means. In August he attended a much-publicised mass meeting in Kiambu where\u2014in front of 30,000 people\u2014he said that \"Mau Mau has spoiled the country. Let Mau Mau perish forever. All people should search for Mau Mau and kill it.\" Despite Kenyatta's vocal opposition to the Mau Mau, KAU had moved towards a position of greater militancy. At its 1951 AGM, more militant African nationalists had taken senior positions and the party officially announced its call for Kenyan independence within three years. In January 1952, KAU members formed a secret Central Committee devoted to direct action, formulated along a cell structure. Whatever Kenyatta's views on these developments, he had little ability to control them. He was increasingly frustrated, and\u2014without the intellectual companionship he experienced in Britain\u2014felt lonely."

        "content": "In October 1952, Kenyatta was arrested and driven to Nairobi, where he was taken aboard a plane and flown to Lokitaung, northwest Kenya, one of the most remote locations in the country. From there he wrote to his family to let them know of his situation. Kenya's authorities believed that detaining Kenyatta would help quell civil unrest. Many white settlers wanted him exiled, but the government feared this would turn him into a martyr for the anti-colonialist cause. They thought it better that he be convicted and imprisoned, although at the time had nothing to charge him with, and so began searching his personal files for evidence of criminal activity. Eventually, they charged him and five senior KAU members with masterminding the Mau Mau, a proscribed group. The historian John M. Lonsdale stated that Kenyatta had been made a \"scapegoat\", while the historian A. B. Assensoh later suggested that the authorities \"knew very well\" that Kenyatta was not involved in the Mau Mau, but that they were nevertheless committed to silencing his calls for independence. The trial took place in Kapenguria, a remote area near the Ugandan border that the authorities hoped would not attract crowds or attention. Together, Kenyatta, Bildad Kaggia, Fred Kubai, Paul Ngei, Achieng Oneko and Kung'u Karumba\u2014the \"Kapenguria Six\"\u2014were put on trial. The defendants assembled an international and multiracial team of defence lawyers, including Chaman Lall, H. O. Davies, F. R. S. De Souza, and Dudley Thompson, led by British barrister and Member of Parliament Denis Nowell Pritt. Pritt's involvement brought much media attention; during the trial he faced government harassment and was sent death threats. The judge selected, Ransley Thacker, had recently retired from the Supreme Court of Kenya; the government knew he would be sympathetic to their case and gave him \u00a320,000 to oversee it. The trial lasted five months: Rawson Macharia, the main prosecution witness, turned out to have perjured himself; the judge had only recently been awarded an unusually large pension and maintained secret contact with the then colonial Governor Evelyn Baring. The prosecution failed to produce any strong evidence that Kenyatta or the other accused had any involvement in managing the Mau Mau. In April 1953, Judge Thacker found the defendants guilty. He sentenced them to seven years' hard labour, to be followed by indefinite restriction preventing them from leaving a given area without permission. In addressing the court, Kenyatta stated that he and the others did not recognise the judge's findings; they claimed that the government had used them as scapegoats as a pretext to shut down KAU. The historian Wunyabari O. Maloba later characterised it as \"a rigged political trial with a predetermined outcome\". The government followed the verdict with a wider crackdown, banning KAU in June 1953, and closing down most of the independent schools in the country, including Kenyatta's. It appropriated his land at Gatundu and demolished his house. Kenyatta and the others were returned to Lokitaung, where they resided on remand while awaiting the results of the appeal process. Pritt pointed out that Thacker had been appointed magistrate for the wrong district, a technicality voiding the whole trial; the Supreme Court of Kenya concurred and Kenyatta and the others were freed in July 1953, only to be immediately re-arrested. The government took the case to the East African Court of Appeal, which reversed the Supreme Court's decision in August. The appeals process resumed in October 1953, and in January 1954 the Supreme Court upheld the convictions against all but Oneko. Pritt finally took the case to the Privy Council in London, but they refused his petition without providing an explanation. He later noted that this was despite the fact his case was one of the strongest he had ever presented during his career. According to Murray-Brown, it is likely that political, rather than legal considerations, informed their decision to reject the case."

        "content": "During the appeal process, a prison had been built at Lokitaung, where Kenyatta and the four others were then interned. The others were made to break rocks in the hot sun but Kenyatta, because of his age, was instead appointed their cook, preparing a daily diet of beans and posho. In 1955, P. de Robeck became the District Officer, after which Kenyatta and the other inmates were treated more leniently. In April 1954, they had been joined by a captured Mau Mau commander, Waruhiu Itote; Kenyatta befriended him, and gave him English lessons. By 1957, the inmates had formed into two rival cliques, with Kenyatta and Itote on one side and the other KAU members\u2014now calling themselves the \"National Democratic Party\"\u2014on the other. In one incident, one of his rivals made an unsuccessful attempt to stab Kenyatta at breakfast. Kenyatta's health had deteriorated in prison; manacles had caused problems for his feet and he had eczema across his body. Kenyatta's imprisonment transformed him into a political martyr for many Kenyans, further enhancing his status. A Luo anti-colonial activist, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, was the first to publicly call for Kenyatta's release, an issue that gained growing support among Kenya's anti-colonialists. In 1955, the British writer Montagu Slater\u2014a socialist sympathetic to Kenyatta's plight\u2014released The Trial of Jomo Kenyatta, a book which raised the profile of the case. In 1958, Rawson Macharia, the key witness in the state's prosecution of Kenyatta, signed an affidavit swearing that his evidence against Kenyatta had been false; this was widely publicised. By the late 1950s, the imprisoned Kenyatta had become a symbol of African nationalism across the continent. His sentence served, in April 1959 Kenyatta was released from Lokitaung. The administration then placed a restricting order on Kenyatta, forcing him to reside in the remote area of Lodwar, where he had to report to the district commissioner twice a day. There, he was joined by his wife Ngina. In October 1961 she bore him another son, Uhuru, and later on another daughter, Nyokabi, and a further son, Muhoho. Kenyatta spent two years in Lodwar. The Governor of Kenya, Patrick Muir Renison, insisted that it was necessary; in a March 1961 speech, he described Kenyatta an \"African leader to darkness and death\" and stated that if he were released, violence would erupt. This indefinite detention was widely interpreted internationally as a reflection of the cruelties of British imperialism. Calls for his release came from the Chinese government, India's Nehru, and Tanganyika's Prime Minister Julius Nyerere. Kwame Nkrumah\u2014whom Kenyatta had known since the 1940s and who was now President of a newly independent Ghana\u2014personally raised the issue with British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and other UK officials, with the Ghanaian government offering Kenyatta asylum in the event of his release. Resolutions calling for his release were produced at the All-African Peoples' Conferences held in Tunis in 1960 and Cairo in 1961. Internal calls for his release came from Kenyan Asian activists in the Kenya Indian Congress, while a colonial government commissioned poll revealed that most of Kenya's indigenous Africans wanted this outcome. By this point, it was widely accepted that Kenyan independence was inevitable, the British Empire having been dismantled throughout much of Asia and Macmillan having made his \"Wind of Change\" speech. In January 1960, the British government made its intention to free Kenya apparent. It invited representatives of Kenya's anti-colonial movement to discuss the transition at London's Lancaster House. An agreement was reached that an election would be called for a new 65-seat Legislative Council, with 33 seats reserved for black Africans, 20 for other ethnic groups, and 12 as 'national members' elected by a pan-racial electorate. It was clear to all concerned that Kenyatta was going to be the key to the future of Kenyan politics. After the Lancaster House negotiations, the anti-colonial movement had split into two parties, the Kenya African National Union (KANU), which was dominated by Kikuyu and Luo, and the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU), which was led largely by members of smaller ethnic groups like the Kalenjin and Maasai. In May 1960, KANU nominated Kenyatta as its president, although the government vetoed it, insisting that he had been an instigator of the Mau Mau. KANU then declared that it would refuse to take part in any government unless Kenyatta was freed. KANU campaigned on the issue of Kenyatta's detainment in the February 1961 election, where it gained a majority of votes. KANU nevertheless refused to form a government, which was instead created through a KADU-led coalition of smaller parties. Kenyatta had kept abreast of these developments, although he had refused to back either KANU or KADU, instead insisting on unity between the two parties."

        "content": "Renison decided to release Kenyatta before Kenya achieved independence. He thought public exposure to Kenyatta prior to elections would make the populace less likely to vote for a man Renison regarded as a violent extremist. In April 1961, the government flew Kenyatta to Maralal, where he maintained his innocence of the charges but told reporters that he bore no grudges. He reiterated that he had never supported violence or the illegal oathing system used by the Mau Mau, and denied having ever been a Marxist, stating: \"I shall always remain an African Nationalist to the end\". In August, he was moved to Gatundu in Kikuyuland, where he was greeted by a crowd of 10,000. There, the colonial government had built him a new house to replace that they had demolished. Now a free man, he travelled to cities like Nairobi and Mombasa to make public appearances. After his release, Kenyatta set about trying to ensure that he was the only realistic option as Kenya's future leader. In August he met with Renison at Kiambu, and was interviewed by the BBC's Face to Face. In October 1961, Kenyatta formally joined KANU and accepted its presidency. In January 1962 he was elected unopposed as KANU's representative for the Fort Hall constituency in the legislative council after its sitting member, Kariuki Njiiri, resigned. Kenyatta traveled elsewhere in Africa, visiting Tanganyika in October 1961 and Ethiopia in November at the invitation of their governments. A key issue facing Kenya was a border dispute in North East Province, alongside Somalia. Ethnic Somalis inhabited this region and claimed it should be part of Somalia, not Kenya. Kenyatta disagreed, insisting the land remain Kenyan, and stated that Somalis in Kenya should \"pack up [their] camels and go to Somalia\". In June 1962, Kenyatta travelled to Mogadishu to discuss the issue with the Somalian authorities, but the two sides could not reach an agreement. Kenyatta sought to gain the confidence of the white settler community. In 1962, the white minority had produced 80% of the country's exports and were a vital part of its economy, yet between 1962 and 1963 they were emigrating at a rate of 700 a month; Kenyatta feared that this white exodus would cause a brain drain and skills shortage that would be detrimental to the economy. He was also aware that the confidence of the white minority would be crucial to securing Western investment in Kenya's economy. Kenyatta made it clear that when in power, he would not sack any white civil servants unless there were competent black individuals capable of replacing them. He was sufficiently successful that several prominent white Kenyans backed KANU in the subsequent election. In 1962 he returned to London to attend one of the Lancaster House conferences. There, KANU and KADU representatives met with British officials to formulate a new constitution. KADU desired a federalist state organised on a system they called Majimbo with six largely autonomous regional authorities, a two-chamber legislature, and a central Federal Council of Ministers who would select a rotating chair to serve as head of government for a one-year term. Renison's administration and most white settlers favoured this system as it would prevent a strong central government implementing radical reform. KANU opposed Majimbo, believing that it served entrenched interests and denied equal opportunities across Kenya; they also insisted on an elected head of government. At Kenyatta's prompting, KANU conceded to some of KADU's demands; he was aware that he could amend the constitution when in office. The new constitution divided Kenya into six regions, each with a regional assembly, but also featured a strong central government and both an upper and a lower house. It was agreed that a temporary coalition government would be established until independence, several KANU politicians being given ministerial posts. Kenyatta accepted a minor position, that of the Minister of State for Constitutional Affairs and Economic Planning. The British government considered Renison too ill at ease with indigenous Africans to oversee the transition to independence and thus replaced him with Malcolm MacDonald as Governor of Kenya in January 1963. MacDonald and Kenyatta developed a strong friendship; the Briton referred to the latter as \"the wisest and perhaps strongest as well as most popular potential Prime Minister of the independent nation to be\". MacDonald sped up plans for Kenyan independence, believing that the longer the wait, the greater the opportunity for radicalisation among African nationalists. An election was scheduled for May, with self-government in June, followed by full independence in December."

        "content": "The May 1963 general election pitted Kenyatta's KANU against KADU, the Akamba People's Party, and various independent candidates. KANU was victorious with 83 seats out of 124 in the House of Representatives; a KANU majority government replaced the pre-existing coalition. On 1\u00a0June 1963, Kenyatta was sworn in as prime minister of the autonomous Kenyan government. Kenya remained a monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. In November 1963, Kenyatta's government introduced a law making it a criminal offence to disrespect the Prime Minister, exile being the punishment. Kenyatta's personality became a central aspect of the creation of the new state. In December, Nairobi's Delamere Avenue was renamed Kenyatta Avenue, and a bronze statue of him was erected beside the country's National Assembly. Photographs of Kenyatta were widely displayed in shop windows, and his face was also printed on the new currency. In 1964, Oxford University Press published a collection of Kenyatta's speeches under the title of Harambee!. Kenya's first cabinet included not only Kikuyu but also members of the Luo, Kamba, Kisii, and Maragoli tribal groups. In June 1963, Kenyatta met with Julius Nyerere and Ugandan President Milton Obote in Nairobi. The trio discussed the possibility of merging their three nations (plus Zanzibar) into a single East African Federation, agreeing that this would be accomplished by the end of the year. Privately, Kenyatta was more reluctant regarding the arrangement and as 1964 came around the federation had not come to pass. Many radical voices in Kenya urged him to pursue the project; in May 1964, Kenyatta rejected a back-benchers resolution calling for speedier federation. He publicly stated that talk of a federation had always been a ruse to hasten the pace of Kenyan independence from Britain, but Nyerere denied that this was true. Continuing to emphasize good relations with the white settlers, in August 1963 Kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at Nakuru. He reassured them that they would be safe and welcome in an independent Kenya, and more broadly talked of forgiving and forgetting the conflicts of the past. Despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do the same with the Indian minority. Like many indigenous Africans in Kenya, Kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many Indians had played in securing the country's independence. He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau fighters to leave the forests and settle in society. Throughout Kenyatta's rule, many of these individuals remained out of work, unemployment being one of the most persistent problems facing his government. A celebration to mark independence was held in a specially constructed stadium on 12 December 1963. During the ceremony, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh\u2014representing the British monarchy\u2014formally handed over control of the country to Kenyatta. Also in attendance were leading figures from the Mau Mau. In a speech, Kenyatta described it as \"the greatest day in Kenya's history and the happiest day in my life.\" He had flown Edna and Peter over for the ceremony, and in Kenya they were welcomed into Kenyatta's family by his other wives. Disputes with Somalia over the Northern Frontier District (NFD) continued; for much of Kenyatta's rule, Somalia remained the major threat to his government. To deal with sporadic violence in the region by Somali shifta guerrillas, Kenyatta sent soldiers into the region in December 1963 and gave them broad powers of arrest and seizure in the NFD in September 1964. British troops were assigned to assist the Kenyan Army in the region. Kenyatta also faced domestic opposition: in January 1964, sections of the army launched a mutiny in Nairobi, and Kenyatta called on the British Army to put down the rebellion. Similar armed uprisings had taken place that month in neighboring Uganda and Tanganyika. Kenyatta was outraged and shaken by the mutiny. He publicly rebuked the mutineers, emphasising the need for law and order in Kenya. To prevent further military unrest, he brought in a review of the salaries of the army, police, and prison staff, leading to pay rises. Kenyatta also wanted to contain parliamentary opposition and at Kenyatta's prompting, in November 1964 KADU officially dissolved and its representatives joined KANU. Two of the senior members of KADU, Ronald Ngala and Daniel arap Moi, subsequently became some of Kenyatta's most loyal supporters. Kenya therefore became a de facto one-party state."

        "content": "In December 1964, Kenya was officially proclaimed a republic. Kenyatta became its executive president, combining the roles of head of state and head of government. Over the course of 1965 and 1966, several constitutional amendments enhanced the president's power. For instance, a May 1966 amendment gave the president the ability to order the detention of individuals without trial if he thought the security of the state was threatened. Seeking the support of Kenya's second largest ethnic group, the Luo, Kenyatta appointed the Luo Oginga Odinga as his vice president. The Kikuyu\u2014who made up around 20 percent of population\u2014still held most of the country's important government and administrative positions. This contributed to a perception among many Kenyans that independence had simply seen the dominance of a British elite replaced by the dominance of a Kikuyu elite. Kenyatta's calls to forgive and forget the past were a keystone of his government. He preserved some elements of the old colonial order, particularly in relation to law and order. The police and military structures were left largely intact. White Kenyans were left in senior positions within the judiciary, civil service, and parliament, with the white Kenyans Bruce Mackenzie and Humphrey Slade being among Kenyatta's top officials. Kenyatta's government nevertheless rejected the idea that the European and Asian minorities could be permitted dual citizenship, expecting these communities to offer total loyalty to the independent Kenyan state. His administration pressured whites-only social clubs to adopt multi-racial entry policies, and in 1964 schools formerly reserved for European pupils were opened to Africans and Asians. Kenyatta's government believed it necessary to cultivate a united Kenyan national culture. To this end, it made efforts to assert the dignity of indigenous African cultures which missionaries and colonial authorities had belittled as \"primitive\". An East African Literature Bureau was created to publish the work of indigenous writers. The Kenya Cultural Centre supported indigenous art and music, and hundreds of traditional music and dance groups were formed; Kenyatta personally insisted that such performances were held at all national celebrations. Support was given to the preservation of historic and cultural monuments, while street names referencing colonial figures were renamed and symbols of colonialism\u2014like the statue of British settler Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere in Nairobi city centre\u2014were removed. The government encouraged the use of Swahili as a national language, although English remained the main medium for parliamentary debates and the language of instruction in schools and universities. The historian Robert M. Maxon nevertheless suggested that \"no national culture emerged during the Kenyatta era\", most artistic and cultural expressions reflecting particular ethnic groups rather than a broader sense of Kenyanness, while Western culture remained heavily influential over the country's elites."

        "title": "Jomo Kenyatta_Economic policy",
        "content": "Independent Kenya had an economy heavily molded by colonial rule; agriculture dominated while industry was limited, and there was a heavy reliance on exporting primary goods while importing capital and manufactured goods. Under Kenyatta, the structure of this economy did not fundamentally change, remaining externally oriented and dominated by multinational corporations and foreign capital. Kenyatta's economic policy was capitalist and entrepreneurial, with no serious socialist policies being pursued; its focus was on achieving economic growth as opposed to equitable redistribution. The government passed laws to encourage foreign investment, recognising that Kenya needed foreign-trained specialists in scientific and technical fields to aid its economic development. Under Kenyatta, Western companies regarded Kenya as a safe and profitable place for investment; between 1964 and 1970, large-scale foreign investment and industry in Kenya nearly doubled. In contrast to his economic policies, Kenyatta publicly claimed he would create a democratic socialist state with an equitable distribution of economic and social development. In 1965, when Thomas Mboya was minister for economic planning and development, the government issued a session paper titled \"African Socialism and its Application to Planning in Kenya\", in which it officially declared its commitment to what it called an \"African socialist\" economic model. The session proposed a mixed economy with an important role for private capital, with Kenyatta's government specifying that it would consider only nationalisation in instances where national security was at risk. Left-wing critics highlighted that the image of \"African socialism\" portrayed in the document provided for no major shift away from the colonial economy. Kenya's agricultural and industrial sectors were dominated by Europeans and its commerce and trade by Asians; one of Kenyatta's most pressing issues was to bring the economy under indigenous control. There was growing black resentment towards the Asian domination of the small business sector, with Kenyatta's government putting pressure on Asian-owned businesses, intending to replace them with African-owned counterparts. The 1965 session paper promised an \"Africanization\" of the Kenyan economy, with the government increasingly pushing for \"black capitalism\". The government established the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation to provide loans for black-owned businesses, and secured a 51% share in the Kenya National Assurance Company. In 1965, the government established the Kenya National Trading Corporation to ensure indigenous control over the trade in essential commodities, while the Trade Licensing Act of 1967 prohibited non-citizens from involvement in the rice, sugar, and maize trade. During the 1970s, this expanded to cover the trade in soap, cement, and textiles. Many Asians who had retained British citizenship were affected by these measures. Between late 1967 and early 1968, growing numbers of Kenyan Asians migrated to Britain; in February 1968 large numbers migrated quickly before a legal change revoked their right to do so. Kenyatta was not sympathetic to those leaving: \"Kenya's identity as an African country is not going to be altered by the whims and malaises of groups of uncommitted individuals.\" Under Kenyatta, corruption became widespread throughout the government, civil service, and business community. Kenyatta and his family were tied up with this corruption as they enriched themselves through the mass purchase of property after 1963. Their acquisitions in the Central, Rift Valley, and Coast Provinces aroused great anger among landless Kenyans. His family used his presidential position to circumvent legal or administrative obstacles to acquiring property. The Kenyatta family also heavily invested in the coastal hotel business, Kenyatta personally owning the Leonard Beach Hotel. Other businesses they were involved with included ruby mining in Tsavo National Park, the casino business, the charcoal trade\u2014which was causing significant deforestation\u2014and the ivory trade. The Kenyan press, which was largely loyal to Kenyatta, did not delve into this issue; it was only after his death that publications appeared revealing the scale of his personal enrichment. Kenyan corruption and Kenyatta's role in it was better known in Britain, although many of his British friends\u2014including McDonald and Brockway\u2014chose to believe Kenyatta was not personally involved."

        "title": "Jomo Kenyatta_Land, healthcare, and education reform",
        "content": "The question of land ownership had deep emotional resonance in Kenya, having been a major grievance against the British colonialists. As part of the Lancaster House negotiations, Britain's government agreed to provide Kenya with \u00a327\u00a0million with which to buy out white farmers and redistribute their land among the indigenous population. To ease this transition, Kenyatta made Bruce McKenzie, a white farmer, the Minister of Agriculture and Land. Kenyatta's government encouraged the establishment of private land-buying companies that were often headed by prominent politicians. The government sold or leased lands in the former White Highlands to these companies, which in turn subdivided them among individual shareholders. In this way, the land redistribution programs favoured the ruling party's chief constituency. Kenyatta himself expanded the land that he owned around Gatundu. Kenyans who made claims to land on the basis of ancestral ownership often found the land given to other people, including Kenyans from different parts of the country. Voices began to condemn the redistribution; in 1969, the MP Jean-Marie Seroney censured the sale of historically Nandi lands in the Rift to non-Nandi, describing the settlement schemes as \"Kenyatta's colonization of the rift\". In part fuelled by high rural unemployment, Kenya witnessed growing rural-to-urban migration under Kenyatta's government. This exacerbated urban unemployment and housing shortages, with squatter settlements and slums growing up and urban crime rates rising. Kenyatta was concerned by this, and promoted the reversal of this rural-to-urban migration, but in this was unsuccessful. Kenyatta's government was eager to control the country's trade unions, fearing their ability to disrupt the economy. To this end it emphasised social welfare schemes over traditional industrial institutions, and in 1965 transformed the Kenya Federation of Labour into the Central Organization of Trade (COT), a body which came under strong government influence. No strikes could be legally carried out in Kenya without COT's permission. There were also measures to Africanise the civil service, which by mid-1967 had become 91% African. During the 1960s and 1970s the public sector grew faster than the private sector. The growth in the public sector contributed to the significant expansion of the indigenous middle class in Kenyatta's Kenya. The government oversaw a massive expansion in education facilities. In June 1963, Kenyatta ordered the Ominda Commission to determine a framework for meeting Kenya's educational needs. Their report set out the long-term goal of universal free primary education in Kenya but argued that the government's emphasis should be on secondary and higher education to facilitate the training of indigenous African personnel to take over the civil service and other jobs requiring such an education. Between 1964 and 1966, the number of primary schools grew by 11.6%, and the number of secondary schools by 80%. By the time of Kenyatta's death, Kenya's first universities\u2014the University of Nairobi and Kenyatta University\u2014had been established. Although Kenyatta died without having attained the goal of free, universal primary education in Kenya, the country had made significant advances in that direction, with 85% of Kenyan children in primary education, and within a decade of independence had trained sufficient numbers of indigenous Africans to take over the civil service. Another priority for Kenyatta's government was improving access to healthcare services. It stated that its long-term goal was to establish a system of free, universal medical care. In the short-term, its emphasis was on increasing the overall number of doctors and registered nurses while decreasing the number of expatriates in those positions. In 1965, the government introduced free medical services for out-patients and children. By Kenyatta's death, the majority of Kenyans had access to significantly better healthcare than they had had in the colonial period. Before independence, the average life expectancy in Kenya was 45, but by the end of the 1970s it was 55, the second-highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. This improved medical care had resulted in declining mortality rates while birth rates remained high, resulting in a rapidly growing population; from 1962 to 1979, Kenya's population grew by just under 4% a year, the highest rate in the world at the time. This put a severe strain on social services; Kenyatta's government promoted family planning projects to stem the birth-rate, but these had little success."

        "content": "In part due to his advanced years, Kenyatta rarely traveled outside of Eastern Africa. Under Kenyatta, Kenya was largely uninvolved in the affairs of other states, including those in the East African Community. Despite his reservations about any immediate East African Federation, in June 1967 Kenyatta signed the Treaty for East African Co-operation. In December he attended a meeting with Tanzanian and Ugandan representatives to form the East African Economic Community, reflecting Kenyatta's cautious approach toward regional integration. He also took on a mediating role during the Congo Crisis, heading the Organisation of African Unity's Conciliation Commission on the Congo. Facing the pressures of the Cold War, Kenyatta officially pursued a policy of \"positive non-alignment\". In reality, his foreign policy was pro-Western and in particular pro-British. Kenya became a member of the British Commonwealth, using this as a vehicle to put pressure on the white-minority apartheid regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia. Britain remained one of Kenya's foremost sources of foreign trade; British aid to Kenya was among the highest in Africa. In 1964, Kenya and the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding, one of only two military alliances Kenyatta's government made; the British Special Air Service trained Kenyatta's own bodyguards. Commentators argued that Britain's relationship with Kenyatta's Kenya was a neo-colonial one, with the British having exchanged their position of political power for one of influence. The historian Poppy Cullen nevertheless noted that there was no \"dictatorial neo-colonial control\" in Kenyatta's Kenya. Although many white Kenyans accepted Kenyatta's rule, he remained opposed by white far-right activists; while in London at the July 1964 Commonwealth Conference, he was assaulted by Martin Webster, a British neo-Nazi. Kenyatta's relationship with the United States was also warm; the United States Agency for International Development played a key role in helping respond to a maize shortage in Kambaland in 1965. Kenyatta also maintained a warm relationship with Israel, including when other East African nations endorsed Arab hostility to the state; he for instance permitted Israeli jets to refuel in Kenya on their way back from the Entebbe raid. In turn, in 1976 the Israelis warned of a plot by the Palestinian Liberation Army to assassinate him, a threat he took seriously. Kenyatta and his government were anti-communist, and in June 1965 he warned that \"it is naive to think that there is no danger of imperialism from the East. In world power politics the East has as much designs upon us as the West and would like to serve their own interests. That is why we reject Communism. \" His governance was often criticised by communists and other leftists, some of whom accused him of being a fascist. When Chinese Communist official Zhou Enlai visited Dar es Salaam, his statement that \"Africa is ripe for revolution\" was clearly aimed largely at Kenya. In 1964, Kenyatta impounded a secret shipment of Chinese armaments that passed through Kenyan territory on its way to Uganda. Obote personally visited Kenyatta to apologise. In June 1967, Kenyatta declared the Chinese Charg\u00e9 d'Affairs persona non grata in Kenya and recalled the Kenyan ambassador from Peking. Relations with the Soviet Union were also strained; Kenyatta shut down the Lumumba Institute\u2014an educational organisation named after the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba\u2014on the basis that it was a front for Soviet influence in Kenya."

        "content": "Kenyatta made clear his desire for Kenya to become a one-party state, regarding this as a better expression of national unity than a multi-party system. In the first five years of independence, he consolidated control of the central government, removing the autonomy of Kenya's provinces to prevent the entrenchment of ethnic power bases. He argued that centralised control of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist quicker economic development. In 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations, and in 1969 passed the Transfer of Functions Act, which terminated grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control. A major focus for Kenyatta during the first three and a half years of Kenya's independence were the divisions within KANU itself. Opposition to Kenyatta's government grew, particularly following the assassination of Pio Pinto in February 1965. Kenyatta condemned the assassination of the prominent leftist politician, although UK intelligence agencies believed that his own bodyguard had orchestrated the murder. Relations between Kenyatta and Odinga were strained, and at the March 1966 party conference, Odinga's post\u2014that of party vice president\u2014was divided among eight different politicians, greatly limiting his power and ending his position as Kenyatta's automatic successor. Between 1964 and 1966, Kenyatta and other KANU conservatives had been deliberately trying to push Odinga to resign from the party. Under growing pressure, in 1966 Odinga stepped down as state vice president, claiming that Kenya had failed to achieve economic independence and needed to adopt socialist policies. Backed by several other senior KANU figures and trade unionists, he became head of the new Kenya Peoples Union (KPU). In its manifesto, the KPU stated that it would pursue \"truly socialist policies\" like the nationalisation of public utilities; it claimed Kenyatta's government \"want[ed] to build a capitalist system in the image of Western capitalism but are too embarrassed or dishonest to call it that.\" The KPU were legally recognised as the official opposition, thus restoring the country's two party system. The new party was a direct challenge to Kenyatta's rule, and he regarded it as a communist-inspired plot to oust him. Soon after the KPU's creation, the Kenyan Parliament amended the constitution to ensure that the defectors\u2014who had originally been elected on the KANU ticket\u2014could not automatically retain their seats and would have to stand for re-election. This resulted in the election of June 1966. The Luo increasingly rallied around the KPU, which experienced localized violence that hindered its ability to campaign, although Kenyatta's government officially disavowed this violence. KANU retained the support of all national newspapers and the government-owned radio and television stations. Of the 29 defectors, only nine were re-elected on the KPU ticket; Odinga was among them, having retained his Central Nyanza seat with a high majority. Odinga was replaced as vice president by Joseph Murumbi, who in turn would be replaced by Moi. In July 1969, Mboya\u2014a prominent and popular Luo KANU politician\u2014was assassinated by a Kikuyu. Kenyatta had reportedly been concerned that Mboya, with U.S. backing, could remove him from the presidency, and across Kenya there were suspicions voiced that Kenyatta's government was responsible for Mboya's death. The killing sparked tensions between the Kikuyu and other ethnic groups across the country, with riots breaking out in Nairobi. In October 1969, Kenyatta visited Kisumu, located in Luo territory, to open a hospital. On being greeted by a crowd shouting KPU slogans, he lost his temper. When members of the crowd started throwing stones, Kenyatta's bodyguards opened fire on them, killing and wounding several. In response to the rise of KPU, Kenyatta had introduced oathing, a Kikuyu cultural tradition in which individuals came to Gatundu to swear their loyalty to him. Journalists were discouraged from reporting on the oathing system, and several were deported when they tried to do so. Many Kenyans were pressured or forced to swear oaths, something condemned by the country's Christian establishment. In response to the growing condemnation, the oathing was terminated in September 1969, and Kenyatta invited leaders from other ethnic groups to a meeting in Gatundu. Kenyatta's government resorted to un-democratic measures to restrict the opposition. It used laws on detention and deportation to perpetuate its political hold. In 1966, it passed the Public Security (Detained and Restricted Persons) Regulations, allowing the authorities to arrest and detain anyone \"for the preservation of public security\" without putting them on trial. In October 1969 the government banned the KPU, and arrested Odinga before putting him under indefinite detainment. With the organised opposition eliminated, from 1969, Kenya was once again a de facto one-party state. The December 1969 general election\u2014in which all candidates were from the ruling KANU\u2014resulted in Kenyatta's government remaining in power, but many members of his government lost their parliamentary seats to rivals from within the party. Over coming years, many other political and intellectual figures considered hostile to Kenyatta's rule were detained or imprisoned, including Seroney, Flomena Chelagat, George Anyona, Martin Shikuku, and Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o. Other political figures who were critical of Kenyatta's administration, including Ronald Ngala and Josiah Mwangi Kariuki, were killed in incidents that many speculated were government assassinations."

        "content": "For many years, Kenyatta had suffered health problems. He had a mild stroke in 1966, and a second in May 1968. He suffered from gout and heart problems, all of which he sought to keep hidden from the public. By 1970, he was increasingly feeble and senile, and by 1975 Kenyatta had\u2014according to Maloba\u2014\"in effect ceased to actively govern\". Four Kikuyu politicians\u2014Koinange, James Gichuru, Njoroge Mungai, and Charles Njonjo\u2014formed his inner circle of associates, and he was rarely seen in public without one of them present. This clique faced opposition from KANU back-benchers spearheaded by Josiah Mwangi Kariuki. In March 1975 Kariuki was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered, and his body was dumped in the Ngong Hills. After Kariuki's murder, Maloba noted, there was a \"noticeable erosion\" of support for Kenyatta and his government. Thenceforth, when the president spoke to crowds, they no longer applauded his statements. In 1977, Kenyatta had several further strokes or heart attacks. On 22 August 1978, he died of a heart attack in the State House, Mombasa. The Kenyan government had been preparing for Kenyatta's death since at least his 1968 stroke; it had requested British assistance in organising his state funeral as a result of the UK's longstanding experience in this area. McKenzie had been employed as a go-between, and the structure of the funeral was orchestrated to deliberately imitate that of deceased British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In doing so, senior Kenyans sought to project an image of their country as a modern nation-state rather than one incumbent on tradition. The funeral took place at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, six days after Kenyatta's death. Britain's heir to the throne, Charles, Prince of Wales, attended the event, a symbol of the value that the British government perceived in its relationship with Kenya. African heads of state also attended, including Nyerere, Idi Amin, Kenneth Kaunda, and Hastings Banda, as did India's Morarji Desai and Pakistan's Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. His body was buried in a mausoleum in the grounds of the Parliament Buildings in Nairobi. Kenyatta's succession had been an issue of debate since independence, and Kenyatta had not unreservedly nominated a successor. The Kikuyu clique surrounding him had sought to amend the constitution to prevent vice president Moi\u2014who was from the Kalenjin people rather than the Kikuyu\u2014from automatically becoming acting president, but their attempts failed amid sustained popular and parliamentary opposition. After Kenyatta's death, the transition of power proved smooth, surprising many international commentators. As vice president, Moi was sworn in as acting president for a 90-day interim period. In October he was unanimously elected KANU President and subsequently declared President of Kenya itself. Moi emphasised his loyalty to Kenyatta\u2014\"I followed and was faithful to him until his last day, even when his closest friends forsook him\"\u2014and there was much expectation that he would continue the policies inaugurated by Kenyatta. He nevertheless criticised the corruption, land grabbing, and capitalistic ethos that had characterised Kenyatta's period and expressed populist tendencies by emphasizing a closer link to the poor. In 1982 he would amend the Kenyan constitution to create a de jure one-party state."

        "content": "Kenyatta was an African nationalist, and was committed to the belief that European colonial rule in Africa must end. Like other anti-colonialists, he believed that under colonialism, the human and natural resources of Africa had been used not for the benefit of Africa's population but for the enrichment of the colonisers and their European homelands. For Kenyatta, independence meant not just self-rule, but an end to the colour bar and to the patronising attitudes and racist slang of Kenya's white minority. According to Murray-Brown, Kenyatta's \"basic philosophy\" throughout his life was that \"all men deserved the right to develop peacefully according to their own wishes\". Kenyatta expressed this in his statement that \"I have stood always for the purposes of human dignity in freedom, and for the values of tolerance and peace.\" This approach was similar to the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda's ideology of \"African humanism\". Murray-Brown noted that \"Kenyatta had always kept himself free from ideological commitments\", while the historian William R. Ochieng observed that \"Kenyatta articulated no particular social philosophy\". Similarly, Assensoh noted that Kenyatta was \"not interested in social philosophies and slogans\". Several commentators and biographers described him as being politically conservative, an ideological viewpoint likely bolstered by his training in functionalist anthropology. He pursued, according to Maloba, \"a conservatism that worked in concert with imperial powers and was distinctly hostile to radical politics\". Kenyatta biographer Guy Arnold described the Kenyan leader as \"a pragmatist and a moderate\", noting that his only \"radicalism\" came in the form of his \"nationalist attack\" on imperialism. Arnold also noted that Kenyatta \"absorbed a great deal of the British approach to politics: pragmatism, only dealing with problems when they become crises, [and] tolerance as long as the other side is only talking\". Donald Savage noted that Kenyatta believed in \"the importance of authority and tradition\", and that he displayed \"a remarkably consistent view of development through self-help and hard work\". Kenyatta was also an elitist and encouraged the emergence of an elite class in Kenya. He wrestled with a contradiction between his conservative desire for a renewal of traditional custom and his reformist urges to embrace Western modernity. He also faced a contradiction between his internal debates on Kikuyu ethics and belief in tribal identity with his need to create a non-tribalised Kenyan nationalism."

        "content": "While in Britain, Kenyatta made political alliances with individuals committed to Marxism and to radical Pan-Africanism, the idea that African countries should politically unify; some commentators have posthumously characterised Kenyatta as a Pan-Africanist. Maloba observed that during the colonial period Kenyatta had embraced \"radical Pan African activism\" which differed sharply from the \"deliberate conservative positions, especially on the question of African liberation\" that he espoused while Kenya's leader. As leader of Kenya, Kenyatta published two collected volumes of his speeches: Harambee and Suffering Without Bitterness. The material included in these publications was carefully selected so as to avoid mention of the radicalism he exhibited while in Britain during the 1930s. Kenyatta had been exposed to Marxist-Leninist ideas through his friendship with Padmore and the time spent in the Soviet Union, but had also been exposed to Western forms of liberal democratic government through his many years in Britain. He appears to have had no further involvement with the communist movement after 1934. As Kenya's leader, Kenyatta rejected the idea that Marxism offered a useful framework for analysing his country's socio-economic situation. The academics Bruce J. Berman and John M. Lonsdale argued that Marxist frameworks for analysing society influenced some of his beliefs, such as his view that British colonialism had to be destroyed rather than simply reformed. Kenyatta nevertheless disagreed with the Marxist attitude that tribalism was backward and retrograde; his positive attitude toward tribal society frustrated some of Kenyatta's Marxist Pan-Africanist friends in Britain, among them Padmore, James, and T. Ras Makonnen, who regarded it as parochial and un-progressive. Assensoh suggested that Kenyatta initially had socialist inclinations but \"became a victim of capitalist circumstances\"; conversely, Savage stated that \"Kenyatta's direction was hardly towards the creation of a radical new socialist society\", and Ochieng called him \"an African capitalist\". When in power, Kenyatta displayed a preoccupation with individual and mbari land rights that were at odds with any socialist-oriented collectivisation. According to Maloba, Kenyatta's government \"sought to project capitalism as an African ideology, and communism (or socialism) as alien and dangerous\"."

        "title": "Jomo Kenyatta_Personality and personal life",
        "content": "Kenyatta was a flamboyant character, with an extroverted personality. According to Murray-Brown, he \"liked being at the centre of life\", and was always \"a rebel at heart\" who enjoyed \"earthly pleasures\". One of Kenyatta's fellow LSE students, Elspeth Huxley, referred to him as \"a showman to his finger tips; jovial, a good companion, shrewd, fluent, quick, devious, subtle, [and] flesh-pot loving\". Kenyatta liked to dress elaborately; throughout most of his adult life, he wore finger rings and while studying at university in London took to wearing a fez and cloak and carrying a silver-topped black cane. He adopted his surname, \"Kenyatta\", after the name of a beaded belt he often wore in early life. As President he collected a variety of expensive cars. Murray-Brown noted that Kenyatta had the ability to \"appear all things to all men\", also displaying a \"consummate ability to keep his true purposes and abilities to himself\", for instance concealing his connections with communists and the Soviet Union both from members of the British Labour Party and from Kikuyu figures at home. This deviousness was sometimes interpreted as dishonesty by those who met him. Referring to Kenyatta's appearance in 1920s Kenya, Murray-Brown stated the leader presented himself to Europeans as \"an agreeable if somewhat seedy 'Europeanized' native\" and to indigenous Africans as \"a sophisticated man-about-town about whose political earnestness they had certain reservations\". Simon Gikandi argued that Kenyatta, like some of his contemporaries in the Pan-African movement, was an \"Afro-Victorian\", someone whose identity had been shaped \"by the culture of colonialism and colonial institutions\", especially those of the Victorian era. During the 1920s and 1930s, Kenyatta cultivated the image of a \"colonial gentleman\"; in England, he displayed \"pleasant manners\" and a flexible attitude in adapting to urban situations dissimilar to the lands he had grown up in. A. R. Barlow, a member of the Church of Scotland Mission at Kikuyu, met with Kenyatta in Britain, later relating that he was impressed by how Kenyatta could \"mix on equal terms with Europeans and to hold his end up in spite of his handicaps, educationally and socially.\" The South African Peter Abrahams met Kenyatta in London, noting that of all the black men involved in the city's Pan-Africanist movement, he was \"the most relaxed, sophisticated and 'westernized' of the lot of us\". As President, Kenyatta often reminisced nostalgically about his time in England, referring to it as \"home\" on several occasions. Berman and Lonsdale described his life as being preoccupied with \"a search for the reconciliation of the Western modernity he embraced and an equally valued Kikuyuness he could not discard\". Gikandi argued that Kenyatta's \"identification with Englishness was much more profound than both his friends and enemies have been willing to admit\". Kenyatta has also been described as a talented orator, author, and editor. He had dictatorial and autocratic tendencies, as well as a fierce temper that could emerge as rage on occasion. Murray-Brown noted that Kenyatta could be \"quite unscrupulous, even brutal\" in using others to get what he wanted, but he never displayed any physical cruelty or nihilism. Kenyatta had no racist impulses regarding white Europeans, as can, for instance, be seen through his marriage to a white English woman. He told his daughter \"the English are wonderful people to live with in England.\" He welcomed white support for his cause, so long as it was generous and unconditional, and spoke of a Kenya in which indigenous Africans, Europeans, Arabs, and Indians could all regard themselves as Kenyans, working and living alongside each other peacefully. Despite this, Kenyatta exhibited a general dislike of Indians, believing that they exploited indigenous Africans in Kenya. Kenyatta was a polygamist. He viewed monogamy through an anthropological lens as an interesting Western phenomenon but did not adopt the practice himself, instead having sexual relations with a wide range of women throughout his life. Murray-Brown characterized Kenyatta as an \"affectionate father\" to his children, but one who was frequently absent. Kenyatta had two children from his first marriage with Grace Wahu: son Peter Muigai Kenyatta (born 1920), who later became a deputy minister; and daughter Margaret Kenyatta (born 1928). Margaret served as mayor of Nairobi between 1970 and 1976 and then as Kenya's ambassador to the United Nations from 1976 to 1986. Of these children, it was Margaret who was Kenyatta's closest confidante. During his trial, Kenyatta described himself as a Christian saying, \"I do not follow any particular denomination. I believe in Christianity as a whole.\" Arnold stated that in England, Kenyatta's adherence to Christianity was \"desultory\". While in London, Kenyatta had taken an interest in the atheist speakers at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, while an Irish Muslim friend had unsuccessfully urged Kenyatta to convert to Islam. During his imprisonment, Kenyatta read up on Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism through books supplied to him by Stock. The Israeli diplomat Asher Naim visited him in this period, noting that although Kenyatta was \"not a religious man, he was appreciative of the Bible\". Despite portraying himself as a Christian, he found the attitudes of many European missionaries intolerable, in particular their readiness to see everything African as evil. In Facing Mount Kenya, he challenged the missionaries' dismissive attitude toward ancestor veneration, which he instead preferred to call \"ancestor communion\". In that book's dedication, Kenyatta invoked \"ancestral spirits\" as part of \"the Fight for African Freedom.\""

        "content": "Within Kenya, Kenyatta came to be regarded as the \"Father of the Nation\", and was given the unofficial title of Mzee, a Swahili term meaning \"grand old man\". From 1963 until his death, a cult of personality surrounded him in the country, one which deliberately interlinked Kenyan nationalism with Kenyatta's own personality. This use of Kenyatta as a popular symbol of the nation itself was furthered by the similarities between their names. He came to be regarded as a father figure not only by Kikuyu and Kenyans, but by Africans more widely. After 1963, Maloba noted, Kenyatta became \"about the most admired post-independence African leader\" on the world stage, one who Western countries hailed as a \"beloved elder statesman.\" His opinions were \"most valued\" both by conservative African politicians and by Western leaders. On becoming Kenya's leader, his anti-communist positions gained favour in the West, and some pro-Western governments gave him awards; in 1965 he, for instance, received medals from both Pope Paul\u00a0VI and from the South Korean government. In 1974, Arnold referred to Kenyatta as \"one of the outstanding African leaders now living\", someone who had become \"synonymous with Kenya\". He added that Kenyatta had been \"one of the shrewdest politicians\" on the continent, regarded as \"one of the great architects of African nationalist achievement since 1945\". Kenneth O. Nyangena characterised him as \"one of the greatest men of the twentieth century\", having been \"a beacon, a rallying point for suffering Kenyans to fight for their rights, justice and freedom\" whose \"brilliance gave strength and aspiration to people beyond the boundaries of Kenya\". In 2018, Maloba described him as \"one of the legendary pioneers of modern African nationalism\". In their examination of his writings, Berman and Lonsdale described him as a \"pioneer\" for being one of the first Kikuyu to write and publish; \"his representational achievement was unique\"."

        "content": "Maxon noted that in the areas of health and education, Kenya under Kenyatta \"achieved more in a decade and a half than the colonial state had accomplished in the preceding six decades.\" By the time of Kenyatta's death, Kenya had gained higher life expectancy rates than most of Sub-Saharan Africa. There had been an expansion in primary, secondary, and higher education, and the country had taken what Maxon called \"giant steps\" toward achieving its goal of universal primary education for Kenyan children. Another significant success had been in dismantling the colonial-era system of racial segregation in schools, public facilities, and social clubs peacefully and with minimal disruption. During much of his life, Kenya's white settlers had regarded Kenyatta as a malcontent and an agitator; for them, he was a figure of hatred and fear. As noted by Arnold, \"no figure in the whole of British Africa, with the possible exception of [Nkrumah], excited among the settlers and the colonial authorities alike so many expressions of anger, denigration and fury as did Kenyatta.\" As the historian Keith Kyle put it, for many whites Kenyatta was \"Satan Incarnate\". This white animosity reached its apogee between 1950 and 1952. By 1964, this image had largely shifted, and many white settlers referred to him as \"Good Old Mzee\". Murray-Brown expressed the view that for many, Kenyatta's \"message of reconciliation, 'to forgive and forget', was perhaps his greatest contribution to his country and to history.\" To Ochieng, Kenyatta was \"a personification of conservative social forces and tendencies\" in Kenya. Towards the end of his presidency, many younger Kenyans\u2014while respecting Kenyatta's role in attaining independence\u2014regarded him as a reactionary. Those desiring a radical transformation of Kenyan society often compared Kenyatta's Kenya unfavourably with its southern neighbour, Julius Nyerere's Tanzania. The criticisms that leftists like Odinga made of Kenyatta's leadership were similar to those that the intellectual Frantz Fanon had made of post-colonial leaders throughout Africa. Drawing upon Marxist theory, Jay O'Brien, for instance, argued that Kenyatta had come to power \"as a representative of a would-be bourgeoisie\", a coalition of \"relatively privileged petty bourgeois African elements\" who wanted simply to replace the British colonialists and \"Asian commercial bourgeoisie\" with themselves. He suggested that the British supported Kenyatta in this, seeing him as a bulwark against growing worker and peasant militancy who would ensure continued neo-colonial dominance. Providing a similar leftist critique, the Marxist writer Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o stated that \"here was a black Moses who had been called by history to lead his people to the promised land of no exploitation, no oppression, but who failed to rise to the occasion\". Ng\u0169g\u0129 saw Kenyatta as a \"twentieth-century tragic figure: he could have been a Lenin, a Mao Tse-Tung, or a Ho Chi Minh; but he ended up being a Chiang Kai-Shek, a Park-Chung Hee, or a Pinochet.\" Ng\u0169g\u0129 was among Kenyan critics who claimed that Kenyatta treated Mau Mau veterans dismissively, leaving many of them impoverished and landless while seeking to remove them from the centre stage of national politics. In other areas Kenyatta's government also faced criticism; it for instance made little progress in advancing women's rights in Kenya. Assensoh argued that in his life story, Kenyatta had a great deal in common with Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah. Simon Gikandi noted that Kenyatta, like Nkrumah, was remembered for \"initiating the discourse and process that plotted the narrative of African freedom\", but at the same time both were \"often remembered for their careless institution of presidential rule, one party dictatorship, ethnicity and cronyism. They are remembered both for making the dream of African independence a reality and for their invention of postcolonial authoritarianism.\" In 1991, the Kenyan lawyer and human rights activist Gibson Kamau Kuria noted that in abolishing the federal system, banning independent candidates from standing in elections, setting up a unicameral legislature, and relaxing restrictions on the use of emergency powers, Kenyatta had laid \"the groundwork\" for Moi to further advance dictatorial power in Kenya during the late 1970s and 1980s. Kenyatta was accused by Kenya's Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission in its 2013 report of using his authority as president to allocate large tracts of land to himself and his family across Kenya. The Kenyatta family is among Kenya's biggest landowners. During the 1990s, there was still much frustration among tribal groups, namely in the Nandi, Nakuru, Uasin-Gishu, and Trans-Nzoia Districts, where under Kenyatta's government they had not regained the land taken by European settlers and more of it had been sold to those regarded as \"foreigners\"\u2014Kenyans from other tribes. Among these groups there were widespread calls for restitution and in 1991 and 1992 there were violent attacks against many of those who obtained land through Kenyatta's patronage in these areas. The violence continued sporadically until 1996, with an estimated 1500 killed and 300,000 displaced in the Rift Valley."

He was active in drawing Irish Catholics and Presbyterians together in the United cause, and in soliciting French assistance for a general insurrection. In November 1798, on his second attempt to land in Ireland with French troops and supplies, he was captured by British naval forces. The United Irish risings of the summer had already been crushed.

        "content": "Wolfe Tone was born on 20 June 1763. His father\u2019s family descended from a French Protestant family who fled to England from Gascony in the 16th century to escape religious persecution. A branch of the family settled in Dublin in the 17th century. Theobald's father, Peter Tone, was a coach-maker who had a farm near Sallins, County Kildare and belonged to the Church of Ireland. His mother came from a Catholic merchant family who converted to Protestantism after Theobald was born. His maternal grandfather was captain of a vessel in the West India trade. He was baptised as Theobald Wolfe Tone in honour of his godfather, Theobald Wolfe of Blackhall, County Kildare, a first cousin of Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden. However, it was widely believed that Tone was the son of Theobald Wolfe, which, if true, made him a half-brother of the poet Charles Wolfe. After his death, he was widely referred to as Wolfe Tone. In 1783, Tone found work as a tutor to Anthony and Robert, younger half-brothers of Richard Martin MP of Galway, a prominent supporter of Catholic emancipation, at Dangan, the Martin family home. Tone fell in love with Martin's wife, but later wrote that it came to nothing. During this period he briefly considered a career in the theatre as an actor. He studied law at Trinity College Dublin, where he became an active member in the College Historical Society debating club and was elected its auditor in 1785. He was made a scholar in 1784 and graduated BA in February 1786. He qualified as a barrister in King's Inns at the age of 26 after keeping the requisite terms as a student member of the Middle Temple in London. As a student, he eloped with Martha Witherington, daughter of William and Catherine Witherington (n\u00e9e Fanning) of Dublin. She would go on to change her name to Matilda, at Tone's request. When they married, Tone was 22, and Matilda was about 16. In 1796, while he was in France and she in Hamburg he wrote in his journal: \"She is the delight of my eyes, the joy of my heart, the only object for which I wish to live. I doat upon her to distraction.\" Disappointed at finding no support for a plan that he had submitted to William Pitt the Younger, to found a military colony in Hawaii, Tone initially planned to enlist as a soldier in the East India Company, but applied too late in the year, when no more ships would be sent out until the following spring."

        "title": "Wolfe Tone_Politician",
        "content": "In September 1791, Tone published An Argument on behalf of the Catholics of Ireland, signed \"A Northern Whig\". It displayed the growing breach between Whig patriots like Henry Flood and Henry Grattan, who sought Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform without severing the tie to England. Tone expressed contempt for the constitution Grattan obtained from the British government in 1782. Himself an Anglican, Tone urged co-operation between the religions in Ireland as the only means of obtaining redress of Irish grievances. The British government had just passed the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791, but the Dublin parliament was in no hurry to do so. Sharing Tone's frustration with Protestant Patriotism, William Drennan proposed to his largely Presbyterian friends in Belfast, \"a benevolent conspiracy--a plot for the people\" dedicated to \"The Rights of Man\" and to \"Real Independence\" for Ireland. Attending their first meeting in Belfast in October 1791, with Cork man Thomas Russell, Tone re-iterated the thrust of his Argument on behalf of the Catholics of Ireland:. the \"imaginary Revolution of 1782\" had failed to secure a representative and national government for Ireland because Protestants had refused to make common cause with Catholics. Ireland would continue to be governed in the exclusive interests of England and of the landed Ascendancy, so long as Irish Protestants remained \"illiberal\", \"bigoted\" and \"blind\". Calling themselves, at Tone's suggestion, the Society of the United Irishmen, the meeting resolved upon an \"equal representation of all the people\" in parliament. Employing, as Drennan had proposed \"much of the secrecy and somewhat of the ceremonial of Free-Masonry\", the Society spread rapidly across the Presbyterian districts of the north, to Dublin and, in alliance with the Catholic Defenders, across the Irish midlands. Aiming at no more than the formation of a union between Catholics and Protestants to press for parliamentary reform, Tone's membership of the Society was not deemed incompatible, in 1792, to his appointment as assistant secretary of the Catholic Committee. The Catholics involved on the committee in Dublin were not united regarding the steps they were to take, and in December 1791, sixty-eight members withdrew, led by Lord Kenmare, with the support of the higher clergy. When the British government questioned the legality of the Catholic Convention called in December 1792, Tone drew up for the committee a statement of the case on which a favourable opinion of counsel was obtained. In January 1793 Tone found \"every reason to be content\" with an audience he and other members of the Catholic Committee had had with the King, George III, in London. In April Dublin Castle put its weight behind Grattan in the passage of a Catholic Relief Act. Catholics were admitted to the franchise (but not yet to Parliament or to Crown offices) on the same limited property terms as Protestants. They could again be called as barristers and serve as army officers. They could not, however, enter parliament or be made state officials above grand jurors. The Convention voted to Tone a sum of \u00a31,500 with a gold medal and voted to dissolve. In this new climate of goodwill the Maynooth College Act 1795 was passed. Sectarian animosity threatened to undermine the United Irishmen movement: two secret societies in Ulster fought against each other: the agrarian Protestant Peep o' Day Boys and their Catholic opponents the Defenders. Tone's aim was to unite both into a revolutionary army of Irish \"men of no property\". Tone himself admitted that with him hatred of England had always been \"rather an instinct than a principle,\" though until his views should become more generally accepted in Ireland he was prepared to work for reform as distinguished from revolution. But he desired to root out the popular respect for the names of Charlemont and Grattan, and to transfer to more violent leaders the conduct of the national movement. Wolfe Tone's principles were drawn from the French Convention, and he was a disciple of Georges Danton and Thomas Paine."

        "content": "In 1794 the Society of United Irishmen became a sworn association, using oaths that aimed at the overthrow of the Kingdom of Ireland. Given that France and Britain had been at war since early 1793, administering or making such oaths turned a reformist republican society that had wanted to extend the franchise within the existing system into a republican revolutionary one. Affiliating more closely with the new French Republic also associated Tone with its evolving policy of \"Dechristianization\", which was strongly opposed by the Catholic Church in Ireland. Although he was seen as a Catholic champion in the early 1790s, most of his wealthier Catholic supporters fell away in 1794. Also in 1794, the United Irishmen, persuaded that no party in the Dublin parliament (where being an MP was limited to Anglicans) seemed likely to accept their scheme of universal manhood suffrage and equal electoral districts, began to recast their hopes on a French invasion. An Irish clergyman living in England, the Reverend William Jackson, who had taken in revolutionary opinions during his long stay in France, came to Ireland to ascertain to what extent the Irish people were ready to support a French invasion. Tone drew up a memorandum for Jackson on the state of Ireland, which he described as ripe for revolution. An attorney named Cockayne, to whom Jackson had imprudently disclosed his mission, betrayed the memorandum to the government. In April 1794 Jackson was arrested on a charge of treason and dramatically committed suicide during his trial. Several of the leading United Irishmen, including Archibald Hamilton Rowan, fled the country; the papers of the United Irishmen were seized by the Dublin administration, and for a time the organisation was broken up. Tone, who had not attended meetings of the society since May 1793, remained in Ireland until after the trial of Jackson and was advised to leave Ireland in April 1795. Having friends among the government party, including members of the Beresford family, he succeeded in making terms with the government and emigrated to the United States, where he arrived in May 1795. Before leaving, he and his family travelled to Belfast, and it was at the summit of Cavehill that Tone made the Cavehill Compact with fellow Irish radicals, including Russell and McCracken, promising \"never to desist in our efforts until we had subverted the authority of England over our country, and asserted our independence.\" The United Irishmen reformed in 1796. The Society began seriously to look to France to support a rising with troops. Living in Philadelphia, Tone wrote a few months later to Thomas Russell expressing unqualified dislike of the American people, whom he imagined to be no more truly democratic in sentiment and no less attached to authority than the British; he described George Washington as a \"high-flying aristocrat\", and he found the aristocracy of money and achievement in America still less to his liking than the European aristocracy of birth. Tone also lived briefly in West Chester and in Downingtown, Pennsylvania. Finding himself at Philadelphia in the company of Reynolds, Rowan, and Tandy, Tone went to Paris to persuade the French government to send an expedition to invade Ireland. In February 1796 he arrived in Paris and had interviews with De La Croix and Carnot, who were impressed by his energy, sincerity, and ability. A commission was given him as adjutant-general in the French army, which he hoped might protect him from the penalty of treason in the event of capture by the British; though he himself claimed the authorship of a proclamation said to have been issued by the United Irishmen, enjoining that all Irishmen taken with arms in their hands in the British service should be instantly shot; and he supported a project for landing La Legion Noire in England, who were to burn Bristol."

        "content": "The French Directory planned a military landing in Ireland in support of the coming revolution foretold by Tone. The Directory possessed information from Lord Edward FitzGerald and Arthur O'Connor confirming Tone, and prepared to despatch an expedition under Louis Lazare Hoche. On 15 December 1796, the expedition, consisting of forty-three sail and carrying about 14,450 men with a large supply of war material for distribution in Ireland, sailed from Brest. Tone accompanied it as \"Adjutant-general Smith\" and had the greatest contempt for the seamanship of the French sailors, who were unable to land due to severe gales. They waited for days off Bantry Bay, waiting for the winds to ease, but eventually returned to France. Tone served for some months in the French army under Hoche, who had become the French Republic's minister of war after his victory against the Austrians at the Battle of Neuwied on the Rhine in April 1797. In June 1797 Tone took part in preparations for a military expedition to Ireland from the Batavian Republic, a puppet state created during the Batavian Revolution in the Low Countries in January 1795. However, the Batavian fleet under Dutch Vice-Admiral Jan de Winter was delayed in the harbour of Texel island that summer by unfavourable easterly winds and from mid-August by a British North-Sea fleet blockade. It eventually put to sea in the first week of October only to be immediately crushed by Admiral Adam Duncan in the Battle of Camperdown on October 11, 1797. Tone then returned to Paris. General Hoche, once tasked with an Irish expeditionary force, died of tuberculosis on 19 September 1797 at Wetzlar after returning to his command on France's Rhine frontier. In Ireland the membership of the United Irish had reached 300,000, about 6% of the population, but a vicious counter-insurgency campaign in 1797 weakened the organisation and forced the leadership to launch a rising without French aid. More importantly, in a largely devoutly Catholic country, the Roman Catholic hierarchy was completely opposed to the United Irish, as they were allied to the French who had just invaded Rome and set up the anti-clerical \"Roman Republic\" in early 1798. Napoleon Bonaparte, with whom Tone had several interviews at this time, was less disposed than Hoche had been to undertake in earnest an Irish expedition; and when the Rising broke out in Ireland in 1798 he had started for Egypt. When Tone urged the Directory to send effective assistance to the Irish rebels, all that could be promised was a number of raids to descend simultaneously around the Irish coast. One of these under General Jean Humbert succeeded in landing a force near Killala, County Mayo, and gained some success in Connacht (particularly at Castlebar) before it was subdued by General Lake and Charles Cornwallis. Wolfe Tone's brother Matthew was captured, tried by court-martial, and hanged; a second raid, accompanied by Napper Tandy, came to disaster on the coast of Donegal; while Wolfe Tone took part in a third, under Admiral Jean-Baptiste-Fran\u00e7ois Bompart, with General Jean Hardy in command of a force of about 3,000 men. This encountered a British squadron at Buncrana on Lough Swilly on 12 October 1798. Tone, on board the ship Hoche, refused Bompart's offer of escape in a frigate before the battle of Tory Island, and was taken prisoner when the Hoche surrendered. Tone was brought ashore at Letterkenny Port and all French forces of the Hoche were taken to Lord Cavan's Letterkenny home where he faced arrest."

To unite the whole people of Ireland: to abolish the memory of all past dissentions; and to substitute the common name of Irishmen in place of the denomination of Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter--these were my means. Yet he conceded that he \"despaired\" of Protestants (i.e. the Anglican Ascendancy) \"for obvious reasons\": they were already in possession of the whole power and patronage of the country. Appearing to \"write off own class completely\" in conversations with General Henri Clarke (a second generation Irishman who later was to serve Napoleon as Minister of War) he apprehended a general massacre of the gentry and a redistribution of their entire property. The violence he would seek to restrain. On this score Hoche cautioned him not to be complacent. Tone records in his Memoirs:Hoche mentioned, also, that great mischief had been done to the principles of liberty and additional difficulties thrown in the way of the French Revolution, by the quantity of blood spilled: \"for\", he added, \"if you guillotine a man, you get rid of an individual, it is true, but then you make all his friends and connections enemies for ever of the government\".Tone expressed himself \"heartily glad to find Hoche of this humane temperament\" and trusted \"we shall be able to avoid unnecessary bloodshed in Ireland.\""

        "content": "When the prisoners were landed a fortnight later, Sir George Hill recognised Tone in the French adjutant-general's uniform in Lord Cavan's privy-quarters at Letterkenny. At his trial by court-martial in Dublin on 8 November 1798 Tone made a speech avowing his determined hostility to England and his intention \"by frank and open war to procure the separation of the countries\". Recognising that the court was certain to convict him, he asked that \"the court should adjudge me to die the death of a soldier, and that I may be shot\". Reading from a prepared speech, he defended his view of a military separation from Britain (as had occurred in the fledgeling United States) and explained his motives: A commentary on the trial continues: \"After a long silence, interrupted by some expressions of admiration, he was told that his request should be submitted to the Lord-lieutenant.  Thinking, however, that there was but little prospect, he committed suicide in prison.  With Wolfe Tone, terminated the insurrection of 1798. He was the prime mover of it, and was its last victim\u2026\" He also lamented the outbreak of mass violence, saying: \"Such are my principles such has been my conduct; if in consequence of the measures in which I have been engaged misfortunes have been brought upon this country, I heartily lament it, but let it be remembered that it is now nearly four years since I have quit Ireland and consequently I have been personally concerned in none of them; if I am rightly informed very great atrocities have been committed on both sides, but that does not at all diminish my regret; for a fair and open war I was prepared; if that has degenerated into a system of assassination, massacre, and plunder I do again most sincerely lament it, and those few who know me personally will give me I am sure credit for the assertion.\" To the people, he had the following to say from the dock: His eloquence was in vain, and his request to be shot was denied. On 10 November 1798, he was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged on 12 November. Before this sentence was carried out, he was mortally wounded as a result either of being tortured by British soldiers or, as is today more generally accepted, of attempting to slit his own throat. The story goes that he was initially saved when the wound was sealed with a bandage, and he was told if he tried to talk the wound would open and he would bleed to death. He responded by saying \"I can yet find words to thank you sir; it is the most welcome news you could give me. What should I wish to live for?\". Military surgeon Benjamin Lentaigne treated Tone just hours before he was due to be hanged. A pamphlet published in Latin by the doctor some years after Tone's official \"suicide\" refers to an unusual neck wound suffered by an unnamed patient which indicated that \"a bullet passed through his throat\". This has led to speculation that Tone may have been shot. Theobald Wolfe Tone died on 19 November 1798 at the age of 35 in Provost's Prison, Dublin, not far from where he was born. He is buried in Bodenstown, Co. Kildare, near his birthplace at Sallins, and his grave is in the care of the National Graves Association."

        "title": "Wolfe Tone_Support from Lord Kilwarden",
        "content": "His godfather Theobald Wolfe was Tone's natural father, according to several sources. A cousin, Arthur Wolfe, Lord Kilwarden, had warned Tone to leave Ireland in 1795. Then when Tone was arrested and brought to Dublin in 1798, and facing certain execution, it was Kilwarden (a senior judge) who granted two orders for Habeas Corpus for his release. This was a remarkable act, given that the rebellion had just occurred with great loss of life, and one that could never be enlarged upon as Kilwarden was killed at the beginning of Emmet's revolt in 1803. The Wolfes knew that Tone was their cousin. As a pillar of the Protestant Ascendancy and, as Attorney-General for Ireland the prosecutor of the case against United Irishman William Orr, Kilwarden had no other obvious motive for trying to assist Tone in 1795 and 1798. Portraits of Wolfe around 1800 arguably show a resemblance to Wolfe Tone. Maud Wolfe (1892\u20131980), the last of the Wolfes to live in Kildare, continued her family tradition of annually laying flowers at Tone's grave until her death. The historian A. T. Q. Stewart has commented (2001) on Tone's long obsession with the heroism and death in battle of James Wolfe in 1759, seeing him as a cousin to be emulated. In this sense \"Wolfe Tone\" becomes a surname reflecting his true paternity."

        "content": "\"[Tone] rises\", said William Lecky, the 19th-century historian, \"far above the dreary level of commonplace which Irish conspiracy in general presents\u2026 His judgement of men and things was keen, lucid and masculine, and he was alike prompt in decision and brave in action.\" His journals, which were written for his family and intimate friends were published in Washington DC in 1821 by his son, William Theobald Wolfe Tone. They were republished in 1910 by Richard Barry O'Brien. Tone was adopted by the Young Ireland movement of the 1840s as an iconic figure, as the father of Irish republicanism and above religious divisions. Its leader Thomas Davis found and publicised the location of Tone's grave in 1843. Modern republicans quote his ideals: In 1898 a series of centenary commemorations of the 1798 rebellion were held by the nationalist Irish Parliamentary Party, the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Catholic Church in Ireland, that to a large extent sidelined Tone and the other Protestant Nationalist leaders. This \"Faith and Fatherland\" approach mythologised Tone and recast the rebellion as Church-sanctioned, the exact opposite of its policy in 1798. Every summer, Irish Republicans hold commemorations at Tone's grave in Bodenstown. In 1912 an annual commemoration march from Naas to Bodenstown was started by Tom Clarke, who was to be executed after the 1916 Rising. The march became a part of the folklore of Irish republican groups, with a new headstone placed in the 1940s. An attempt on 17 June 1934 by Protestant Republican Congress members from Belfast to join in the commemoration march was prevented by IRA stewards. The marchers were stoned and \"scuffles broke out\". This was portrayed by some commentators as sectarianism, that republicans had abandoned Tone's aim to unite Irishmen by ignoring their religious differences, paying tribute only to his anti-British republicanism. However, Brian Hanley's history of the IRA from 1926 to 1936 concludes that the trouble arose because they were seen as \"communist\", and not for sectarian reasons. From the 1960s the Wolfe Tone Societies were founded, but failed to have an impact on mainstream Irish politics. Some members were also affiliated with the IRA. As a result, Tone's grave was bombed at night by the Ulster Volunteer Force in 1971, and was then rebuilt."

Raised in France by his mother after Tone's death, William was appointed a cadet in the Imperial School of Cavalry in 1810 on Napoleon's orders. He was a naturalised French citizen on 4 May 1812.

He was a member until the initial breakup in 2000. Among his musical projects of recent years, Iha has been a permanent fixture of A Perfect Circle. He was most recently a member of Tinted Windows, a 1960s/1970s inspired group with members of Cheap Trick, Fountains of Wayne, and Hanson. He rejoined the Smashing Pumpkins in 2018. Iha has produced songs, contributed guitar and vocals, and produced remixes for a number of artists, including Midnight Movies, Isobel Campbell, Marilyn Manson, Whiskeytown, and Michael Stipe. He co-owned Scratchie Records, an independent record label, with Adam Schlesinger, and from 1999-2012 owned a recording studio with Schlesinger and Andy Chase of Ivy called Stratosphere Sound."

        "content": "In 1987 Iha, then playing guitar in the Chicago band Snake Train, met Billy Corgan via a friend.  Corgan had already been telling people he was in a band called \"Smashing Pumpkins\", and decided to make it a real band with Iha. Iha later became romantically involved with the band's bassist D'arcy Wretzky, but the couple broke up just prior to the band's performance at the Reading Festival in 1992. After a brief feud between the two, Iha sustained a friendly and close relationship with Wretzky, citing her as a best friend. Iha wrote and sang a number of Smashing Pumpkins' songs, such as: \"Blew Away\" on Pisces Iscariot, \"Bugg Superstar\" on Vieuphoria, \"Take Me Down\" on Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, \"...Said Sadly\", \"Believe\", \"The Boy\", and \"The Bells\" on The Aeroplane Flies High, \"Summer\" on the \"Perfect\" single and \"Go\" on Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music.  He co-wrote with Billy Corgan \"I Am One\" on Gish, \"Soma\" and \"Mayonaise\" on Siamese Dream, \"Plume\" on Pisces Iscariot and \"Farewell and Goodnight\" on Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. He sang the band's covers of the Cure's \"A Night Like This\" and Syd Barrett's \"Terrapin\". During his time with the Pumpkins, Iha recorded with other bands, including Ivy, to which Adam Schlesinger contributed, and Swedish New Wave band the Sounds. Billy Corgan has claimed that Iha played very little guitar on the first two Smashing Pumpkins albums, with Corgan himself playing most of the parts in the studio that Iha played live. Iha was often considered the \"quiet one\" in Smashing Pumpkins, but he was known to engage in ad-libbed jokes and rap sessions at live performances.  His humor was encapsulated in his use of the catchphrase, \"I've seen a million faces, and I've rocked them all,\" originally from the Bon Jovi song \"Wanted Dead or Alive\". In 1998, Iha released a moderately successful solo album, Let It Come Down. One music video was produced from this album, for the song \"Be Strong Now\", which was released as a four-track single. When his former bandmates Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin revived the \"Smashing Pumpkins\" name, Iha did not participate, and in fact had not spoken to Corgan in years. Corgan stated in a 2008 blog entry that when he and Chamberlin reunited, the \"door was open\" for Iha to rejoin, but he declined, and Corgan said that he \"can now say definitively that Iha isn't ever coming back.\" However, in a 2012 interview about the band reformation, Iha stated that he was never even asked back into the band in the first place. Iha also admitted within the interview that he has not heard any of the band's new music since the reformation. In a March 2013 interview, he was asked about looking back at the band's history and explained that he never really thought about his former success with the band, but did look back with fondness when asked about the 6 studio albums he made with them.  He revealed that he and Corgan had not spoken in around ten years, but that he did speak to Wretzky \"once in a while\". On March 26, 2016 and March 27, 2016, Iha joined Corgan and Chamberlin on stage unannounced at back to back Smashing Pumpkins shows at the Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. Iha played a third show with the band in their hometown of Chicago at the Civic Opera house on April 14, 2016. In 2017, reunion rumors were leaked through various sources, and in 2018, Iha was spotted with Corgan, Chamberlin, and current Smashing Pumpkins guitarist Jeff Schroeder in the studio and at a photo shoot, confirming his return to the band.  In summer 2018, the reunited band embarked on the Shiny And Oh So Bright Tour, which was followed at the end of the year by the release of their album Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun.  Iha would go on to also record Cyr with the reunited lineup, which was released in November 2020."

        "content": "After the Smashing Pumpkins' breakup in 2000, Iha pursued many projects. He continues to contribute to other artists' recordings, such as \"Don't Be Sad\" on Whiskeytown's Pneumonia released in 2001 and further guest appearances for bands Ivy and Fountains of Wayne, both of which he remained close to, appearing on virtually every release by both bands since 1997. Andy Chase of Ivy, and Adam Schlesinger of both Ivy and Fountains, recorded on most songs James produced or wrote for other artists. Schlesinger first recorded on Iha's song on \"The Bells\" by the Smashing Pumpkins. Iha made bigger news when he joined the alternative rock supergroup A Perfect Circle in July 2003 in time for their Thirteenth Step club tour. He has since recorded on their 2004 album eMOTIVe as well as contributed remixes of Blue and Outsider, and is back with the band following its near 6-year long hiatus. In 2003, he joined Vanessa and the O's. The group released an EP Plus Rien in Sweden the same year and followed up with the album La Ballade d'O in 2005\u201306 on the band's independent record company Rushmore Recordings playing live shows in Sweden during the summer of 2005. Iha has collaborated on musical and fashion design projects in Japan. He collaborated on and produced two tracks with Japanese musician Chara for her 2001 album Madrigal called \"Boku ni Utsushite\" and \"Skirt\". The latter was accompanied by a music video featuring Iha as a hunter in a forest. With the help of longtime friend and manager Isao Izutsu, Iha started the clothing label Vaporize (f.k.a. 'Vapor') in 2001, and recorded \"Never Ever\", his first solo song since the Smashing Pumpkins demise, for Vaporize's first runway show. In 2001, Iha played live with the Blank Theory and recorded on their album Beyond the Calm of the Corridor producing the song \"Addicted\" together with Schlesinger and contributing guitar playing."

The same year he teamed with Schlesinger again to produce a duet cover of Bobby Darin's \"Splish Splash\" for the soundtrack to the Wayne Wang film Because of Winn-Dixie. The same year Iha contributed guitar to some tracks of Chino Moreno's band Team Sleep second album, which has yet to be released. Iha produced two tracks on the 2006 tribute album to Serge Gainsbourg, Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited, \"I love you (me either)\", that featured Cat Power and model Karen Elson singing and \"L'Hotel\" with Michael Stipe on vocals. Iha recorded on the track \"The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde\" in a duet with singer Kazu Makino (of Blonde Redhead) on the US edition of the album. In February 2006, a digital EP \"In the Sun\" produced by Iha featuring Michael Stipe and Chris Martin was released. The EP was for the benefit of Gulf Coast victims of Hurricane Katrina. The song was featured on an episode of Grey's Anatomy. In collaboration with Stipe, Iha played guitar at the \"Bring 'Em Back Home Now\" concert in March 2006 in New York City to benefit Iraq War veterans peace groups such as Veterans for Peace. Iha remixed \"Me Plus One\", a track from Norwegian pop singer Annie's debut album Anniemal. Released in October 2006, Florida pop group the Postmarks's \"Goodbye\" EP features a remix by Iha. That same year, Iha teamed up with Schlesinger to co-produce folk band America's comeback album, Here & Now, and recorded on Scottish singer Isobel Campbell's album, collaborating on her renditions of traditional Irish and Scottish folk songs. In 2006 Iha recorded a cover of \"Judy Is a Punk\" by the Ramones for 30th anniversary of a Japanese clothing label Beams. In February 2007, Side-Line announced that Iha delivered a remix for the Ladytron single \"Weekend Mixes\" out on March 9 via Smoke & Mirrors. In April 2007, he recorded a remix for the Midnight Movies track \"Patient Eye\". Iha appeared on stage with Swedish band the Sounds, on the season finale of MTV's Bam's Unholy Union in April 2007 and contributed guitar to the song \"Seatbacks and Traytables\", on Fountains of Wayne's 2007 album Traffic and Weather. His former bandmate Melissa Auf der Maur contributed to that album."

In the spring of 2007, Iha remixed Midnight Movies and the Postmarks as freebies on the Internet. A Chicago weekly reported in June 2007 that Iha had been living in New York City for some time, running a recording studio and independent label. Iha had lived in Manhattan since 2000 and has since moved to Brooklyn. In May 2008, Marilyn Manson said that Iha would be making a guest appearance on his new record; however, Iha was not credited as a guitarist on the album. On December 22, 2008, the Swedish band A Camp (the solo project of the Cardigans vocalist Nina Persson) put out a press release announcing that their new album would come out on April 28, 2009, featuring guest appearances by Iha and other musicians. On February 17, 2009, it was announced that Iha had, together with Taylor Hanson, Fountains of Wayne bassist Adam Schlesinger, and Cheap Trick drummer Bun E. Carlos formed a new band called Tinted Windows. The band played their first publicized gig at SXSW in Austin, Texas on March 20. Their first album was released on April 21, 2009 to generally positive reviews. In April 2010, Iha' website reopened. According to the site, Iha considered his next solo album \"halfway done (in his mind)\". Shortly thereafter, a picture of Iha with Kelly Pratt and Jon Natchez from the band Beirut was posted on the Web site saying they would be playing horns on the album. In August 2010, members of A Perfect Circle posted messages to their Twitter accounts telling fans of their return after a 6-year long hiatus. The band later announced tour dates in which they would be playing the entirety of each of their three albums at each concert, with one album being played per night. It was announced that the line-up would consist of Maynard James Keenan, Billy Howerdel, Josh Freese, Matt McJunkins, and Iha. Iha's second solo album titled Look to the Sky was released in March 2012. To begin its promotion, Iha performed at the 2nd EMI ROCKS festival in Saitama, Japan in February 2012, and later in December that year performing a small European tour in London, Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon. In 2013, under management of David Bason, Iha collaborated with Japanese musician Yukihiro Takahashi, writing songs for and performing on Takahashi's album Life Anew, and performing as part of Takahashi's band \"In Phase\" on tours in Japan. In 2014 Iha scored the soundtrack to Lionsgate/Hulu series Deadbeat. On March 26, 2016 Iha rejoined Smashing Pumpkins onstage for several numbers. In 2016 Iha composed the score for James Franco's film Mother, May I Sleep with Danger? In 2017 Iha composed the score for the drama series The Arrangement."

        "content": "Home was born in South London.  His mother, Julia Callan-Thompson, was a model who was associated with the radical arts scene in Notting Hill Gate. In the 1980s and 1990s, he exhibited art and also wrote a number of non-fiction pamphlets, magazines, and books, and edited anthologies. They chiefly reflected the politics of the radical left, punk culture, the occult, the history and influence of the Situationists \u2013 of whom he is a severe critic \u2013 and other radical left-wing 20th century anti-art avant-garde movements. In Home's earlier work, the focus of these reflections was often Neoism, a subcultural network of which he had been a member, and from which he derived various splinter projects. Typical characteristics of his activism in the 1980s and 1990s included use of group identities (such as Monty Cantsin) and collective monikers (e.g. \"Karen Eliot\"); overt employment of plagiarism; pranks and publicity stunts."

He attended meetings of many different leftist groups including several organised by the Trotskyist Socialist Youth League and even two editorial meetings of Anarchy Magazine. He refused to join any of these organisations and later repudiated them as reactionary, instead professing autonomous communist political positions after going to London Workers Group. In the late seventies Home produced his first punk (music) fanzines including early issues of \"Down in the Street\" which had run to seven numbers by the time he stopped publishing it in 1980. At the end of the seventies Home also made his first public appearances as a musician most notably as bassist with revolutionary ska band The Molotovs. The latter group mixed covers of classic reggae numbers like 'Johnny Too Bad' with original tunes such as \"Notting Hill Carnival\" (about rioting) and 'Don't Envy The Boss' (the juvenile irony of the chorus ran to: \"don't envy the boss, I know he's got a lot, but he really really earned the money to pay for his yacht\u201d)."

        "title": "Stewart Home_1980s",
        "content": "From 1982 to 1984, Home operated as a one-person-movement \"Generation Positive\", and having already founded a punk band called White Colours (named after an experimental novel by R. D. Reeve) in 1980, he started a new group with the same name in 1982. He also published an art fanzine SMILE, the name of which was a play on the Mail Art zines FILE and VILE (which in turn parodied the graphic design of LIFE magazine). The concept was that many other bands in the world should call themselves White Colours, and many other underground periodicals should call themselves SMILE, too. Home's early SMILE magazines mostly contained art manifestos for the \"Generation Positive\", which in their rhetoric resembled those of 1920s Berlin Dadaist manifestos. In April 1984, Home got in touch with the originally American subcultural artistic network of Neoism, and participated in the eighth Neoist Apartment Festival in London. Since Neoism operated with multiple identities, too, and called upon all its participants to adopt the name Monty Cantsin, Home decided to give up the \"Generation Positive\" in favor of Neoism, and make SMILE and White Colours part of Neoism as well. According to Florian Cramer (who didn't come into contact with Neoism until the late eighties) one year later, Home took a sleep-deprivation prank played with him at a Neoist Festival in Italy as the reason to declare his split from Neoism; Home insists he decided to break with Neoism before going to Italy. Shortly before, a conflict between him and Neoism founder Istvan Kantor had escalated and led to their alienation. Home's SMILE no 8, which appeared in 1985, reflected the split with Neoism by proposing a \"Praxis\" movement to replace Neoism, with Karen Eliot as its new multiple name. This and the following three SMILE issues otherwise featured an eclectic mixture of manifesto-style writing, political reflections on radical left-wing anti-art movements from the Lettrist International, the Situationists, Fluxus, Mail Art, individuals such as Gustav Metzger and Henry Flynt, and short parodistic skinhead pulp prose in the style of his then unwritten early novels. Many texts included in Home's SMILE issues plagiarised other, especially Situationist, writing, simply replacing terms like \"spectacle\" with \"glamour\". At the same time Home was involved in a series of collective installations including \"Ruins of Glamour\" (Chisenhale Studios, London 1986), \"Desire in Ruins\" (Transmission Gallery, Glasgow 1987), \"Refuse\" (Galleriet L\u00e4derfabriken, Malm\u00f6 1988) and \"Anon\" (33 Arts Centre, Luton 1989) which generated serious art world interest and art publication reviews and even coverage in British newspapers such as \"The Observer\" and \"Independent\". Those Home worked closely with on these shows included Hannah Vowles and Glyn Banks (collectively known as Art in Ruins), Ed Baxter and Stefan Szczelkun. Following on from this and drawing on 1980s American appropriation art, Home's concept of plagiarism soon developed into a proposed movement and a series of \"Festivals of Plagiarism\" in 1988 and 1989, which themselves plagiarised the Neoist apartment festivals and 1960s Fluxus festivals. Home combined the plagiarism campaign with a call for an Art Strike between 1990 and 1993. Unlike earlier art-strike proposals such as that of Gustav Metzger in the 1970s, it was not intended as an opportunity for artists to seize control of the means of distributing their own work, but rather as an exercise in propaganda and psychic warfare aimed at smashing the entire art world rather than just the gallery system. The Art Strike campaign caused something of a rumpus in the contemporary London art world (Home got to talk about the Art Strike at venues such as the Institute of Contemporary Art and Victoria and Albert Museum, as well as on national BBC Radio arts programmes and London area television arts programmes), but was more seriously discussed in subcultural art networks, especially in Mail Art. Consequently, mail artists made up a reasonable proportion of the participants at the Festivals of Plagiarism, and Mail Art publications disseminated the Art Strike campaign. To what extent Home actually participated in the Art Strike remains disputed, since two of his books, completed allegedly before 1990, appeared during the period of the strike. In the 1980s Home was also a regular contributor to the anarcho-punk/cultural magazine VAGUE."

        "content": "In 1993 Home officially resurfaced, having meanwhile gained an influence and reputation in American counter-culture comparable to writers like Hakim Bey and Kathy Acker. Aside from reassessments of his earlier engagement with Neoism, the Situationists, punk, and the plagiarism and Art Strike campaigns, and, as his source of income, the continued parodistic pulp-novel writing, Home's style had undergone some significant changes. While his late 1980s pamphleteering could be viewed as an, albeit subtly humorous, project to collect and fuse radical energies from aesthetically uncompromising extreme left-wing fringes of art and politics, Home reinvented himself in the 1990s as a cynical satirist and jester. In the post-Art Strike years, he had for the first time publicly occupied himself with hermeticism and the occult. The Neoist Alliance, his third one-person-movement after The Generation Positive and Praxis, served simultaneously as a tactical reappropriation of the Neoism label for self-promotional purposes, and as a corporate identity for pamphlets that satirically advocated a combination of artistic avant-garde, the occult, and politics into an \"avant-bard\". Meanwhile, Home continued to be courted by the London art world, and in the mid-nineties in particular he was championed by the young and very fashionable artist-curator Matthew Higgs (who at that time was also playing a significant role in propelling future Turner Prize winners Jeremy Deller and Martin Creed into the public eye). Higgs included Home in group shows he curated \u2013 such as \"Imprint 93\" at City Racing (London June\u2013July 95), \"Multiple Choice\" at Cubitt Gallery (London March\u2013April 96) and \"A to Z\" at Approach Gallery (London 1998) \u2013 as well issuing a pamphlet and later a badge by Home as part of his prestigious edition of Imprint 93 multiples. At this time uber curator Hans Ulrich Obrist also included Home in his survey of young British art \"Life/Live\" Mus\u00e9e d\u2019art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (October 96- January 97, subsequently toured). In the mid-nineties Home was also appearing regularly as a live artist at \"Disobey\" events organised by Paul Smith and featuring music from the likes of techno acts Panasonic and Aphex Twin."

        "content": "Aware of the marked decline in countercultural activities throughout the urban centres in which he operated, Home shifted gear in this area of his work in the new millennium, upping his level of Internet activities; web work had been only a minor part of his repertoire in the 1990s. Aside from running his own website, Home is a dedicated blogger and had six separate MySpace profiles (as well as having active accounts with other social networking sites such as Twitter, YouTube, Flickr and Facebook). However, given Home's extrovert personality, he maintains a taste for live appearances and in 2007 began performing ventriloquism in public. This activity was preceded by Internet ventriloquism using two MySpace profiles as Mister Trippy and a ventriloquist doll called Tessie (who often claimed to be pregnant and became very angry when Home suggested dolls can't become pregnant). Home's novels in this period no longer incorporated subcultural elements and instead focused on issues of form and aesthetics: 69 Things to Do with a Dead Princess contains capsule reviews of dozens of obscure books as well as elaborate descriptions of stone circles, while in Down and Out in Shoreditch & Hoxton every paragraph is exactly 100 words long. At times in this period Home's film making also became radically non-representational, and rarely required any original cinematography whatsoever; for example his 2002 fiftieth anniversary English language colour re-make of Guy Debord's \"Screams in Favour of De Sade\", and 2004 \"Eclipse & Re-Emergence of the Oedipus Complex\", the latter consists solely of still photographs of his mother with a narration scripted by Home but delivered by Australian actress Alice Parkinson. This tendency towards abstraction was already evident in some of Home's work of the 1990s, particularly sound pieces such as the cut up radio play \"Divvy\", but in the 2000s it became increasingly central to his output. This ran parallel to Home's increasing acceptance by various sections of the high brow art world, evidenced for example by the fact that in 2006 he produced an exhibition entitled \"Hallucination Generation\" at the prestigious Arnolfini in Bristol, won a major Arts Council/BBC commission \"London Art Tripping\" and he was editor of the Semina series for art book publisher Book Works in London (2007\u20132010); as well as being writer-in-residence at the Tate Modern in London (2007/08). However, Home combines these activities with a critique of the institution of art."

        "content": "The Neoist Alliance was a moniker used by Home between 1994 and 1999 for his mock-occult psychogeographical activities. According to Home, the alliance was an occult order with himself as the magus and only member. The manifesto called for \"debasement in the arts\" and in a parodic manner plagiarized a 1930s British fascist pamphlet on cultural politics. Alliance activities mainly consisted of the publication of a newsletter \"Re-action\" which appeared in ten issues. In 1993, the Neoist Alliance staged a prank against a concert by composer Karlheinz Stockhausen in Brighton by announcing its intention to levitate the concert hall by magical means during the concert. This was an homage to the 1965 anti-art picketing of a Stockhausen concert in New York by Fluxus members Henry Flynt and George Maciunas. Alliance activities ran parallel and were closely related to those of the revived London Psychogeographical Association and the Italian-based Luther Blissett project. Despite its name, the Neoist Alliance had no affiliation with the international Neoist network which had been active since 1980. Stewart Home had previously become a member and activist of that network in 1984, but renounced it one year later and subsequently worked under the collective monikers of \"Praxis\", later \"plagiarism\" and the Art Strike movement."

        "content": "Home's first books, which appeared between 1988 and 1995, are essentially an outgrowth and elaboration of his earlier SMILE writings, though without their fragmentary-aphoristic character and eclectic mix of genres. The Assault on Culture, written when Home was twenty-five, is an underground art history sketching Home's ultimately personal history of ideas and influences in post-World War II fringe radical art and political currents, and including \u2013 for the first time in a book \u2013 a tactically manipulated history of post-war culture to make it conclude with Neoism (and which it is sometimes claimed includes character assassinations of individual Neoists) that was continued in the later book Neoism, Plagiarism and Praxis. Despite its highly personal perspective and agenda, The Assault on Culture: Utopian currents from Lettrisme to Class War (Aporia Press and Unpopular Books, London, 1988) is considered a useful art-history work, providing an introduction to a range of cultural currents which had, at that time at least, been under-documented. The work has, however, been highly criticised for deficiencies in its view of utopian currents, including its personal biases, by such writers as Bob Black. Like Home's other publications of that time, it played an influential part in renewing interest in the Situationist International. Pure Mania, Home's first novel from 1989, took the recipe of the Richard Allen parodies from SMILE  and turned them into a recipe for much of his subsequent novel writing of the 1990s (there are exceptions such as the non-linear \"Come Before Christ & Murder Love\"). The book Neoist Manifestos/The Art Strike Papers featured, on its first part, abridged versions of Home's manifesto-style writings from SMILE, and a compilation of writings and reactions regarding the Art Strike from various authors and sources, mainly Mail Art publications. His 1995 novel Slow Death fictionalises and ridicules this process of the historification of Neoism (including the planting of archives at the National Art Library in the Victoria and Albert Museum; this recently became reality when Home sold the V&A his own archive documenting twenty years of his art and underground activities including those involving Neoism) as if to give his own game away but, typically with Home, as soon as one agenda has, apparently, been exposed, whether Home's own or one at large, the game moves on so that he constantly forces readers into a position of 'Should I believe any of this?'. With the publication of his novel 69 Things to Do with a Dead Princess (Canongate, Edinburgh 2002), Home finally got the British literary press sitting up and taking serious notice of him, ironically for a book which carries his most acidic condemnations of the literary establishment. Home's skinhead looks and attitude on official photographs of the mid-nineties are merely publicity poses, and recently he has been much more inclined to appear nude in publicity material (this started after Home consented to appear in a nude celebrity feature for a Finnish newspaper in 2004); and this nudity is something that offends just as much as Home's earlier faked 'hard man' looks."

He possibly received musical instruction from John Barry, one of the choir members at the New South Church, but for the most part he was self-taught. Billings had an unusual appearance and a strong addiction to snuff.  His contemporary wrote that Billings \"was a singular man, of moderate size, short of one leg, with one eye, without any address & with an uncommon negligence of person. Still, he spake & sung & thought as a man above the common abilities.\" Billings' wife died on March 26, 1795, leaving him with six children under the age of 18. He died in poverty in Boston on September 26, 1800. His funeral was announced in the Columbian Centinel: \"Died- Mr. William Billings, the celebrated music composer.

Written as an answer to a criticism of his use of harmony, \"Jargon\" contains a tongue-in-cheek text, and jarring dissonances that sound more like those of the 20th century than of the 18th.

        "content": "Billings' work was very popular in its heyday, but his career was hampered by the primitive state of copyright law in America at the time. By the time the copyright laws had been strengthened, it was too late for Billings:  the favorites among his tunes had already been widely reprinted in other people's hymnals, permanently copyright-free. With changes in the public's musical taste, Billings' fortunes declined.  His last tune-book, The Continental Harmony, was published as a project of his friends, in an effort to help support the revered but no longer popular composer.  His temporary employment as a Boston street sweeper was probably a project of a similar nature. Billings died in poverty at age 53, and for a considerable time after his death, his music was almost completely neglected in the American musical mainstream.  However, his compositions remained popular for a time in the rural areas of New England, which resisted the newer trends in sacred music.  Moreover, a few of Billings' songs were carried southward and westward through America, as a result of their appearance in shape note hymnals.  They ultimately resided in the rural South, as part of the Sacred Harp singing tradition. In the latter part of the twentieth century a Billings revival occurred, and a sumptuous complete scholarly edition of his works was published (see Books, below).  Works by Billings are commonly sung by American choral groups today, particularly performers of early music.  In addition, the recent spread of Sacred Harp music has acquainted many more people with Billings' music: several of his compositions are among the more frequently sung of the works in the Sacred Harp canon."

The modern American composer William Schuman featured Billings' American Revolutionary War anthem \"Chester\", along with two other of Billings' hymns (\"When Jesus Wept\" and \"Be Glad Then, America\"), in his composition New England Triptych (1956). William Billings was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. American composer Roger Lee Hall had the premiere of his choral work in 1980 entitled \"The Pleasures of Variety - Homage to William Billings.\" In 1996, modern dance choreographer Twyla Tharp premiered a piece entitled \"Sweet Fields\" using many hymns by Billings and other early American choral composers. American composer John Cage incorporated chance-derived fragmentations of many of Billings compositions in his works centered around the bicentennial celebration commissions that he received, including \"Apartment House 1776\", \"44 Harmonies\", and \"Quartets I-VIII\". Cage also employed the music of other Colonial-era composers in these works as well."

        "content": "Mahavira (), also known as Vardhamana, was the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism. He was the spiritual successor of the 23rd Tirthankara Parshvanatha. Tradition holds that Mahavira was born in the early part of the 6th century BCE into a royal Jain family in Bihar, India. But many scholars believe this date to be as much as 100 years early. His mother's name was Trishala and his father's name was Siddhartha. They were lay devotees of Parshvanatha. Mahavira abandoned all worldly possessions at the age of about 30 and left home in pursuit of spiritual awakening, becoming an ascetic. Mahavira practiced intense meditation and severe austerities for twelve and a half years, after which he attained Kevala Jnana (omniscience). He preached for 30 years and attained Moksha (liberation) in the 6th century BCE, although the year varies by sect. Historically, Mahavira, who preached Jainism in ancient India, was an older contemporary of Gautama Buddha. Mahavira taught that observance of the vows of ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) are necessary for spiritual liberation. He taught the principles of Anekantavada (many-sided reality): syadvada and nayavada. Mahavira's teachings were compiled by Indrabhuti Gautama (his chief disciple) as the Jain Agamas. The texts, transmitted orally by Jain monks, are believed to have been largely lost by about the 1st century CE (when the remaining were first written down in the Svetambara tradition). The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of Svetambara Jainism's foundation texts, but their authenticity is disputed in Digambara Jainism. Mahavira is usually depicted in a sitting or standing meditative posture, with the symbol of a lion beneath him. His earliest iconography is from archaeological sites in the North Indian city of Mathura, and is dated from between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE. His birth is celebrated as Mahavir Janma Kalyanak and his nirvana (salvation) and also his first shishya (spiritual enlightenment) of Shri Gautama Swami is observed by Jains as Diwali."

He is known as Sramana in the Kalpa S\u016btra, \"devoid of love and hate\". According to later Jain texts, Mahavira's childhood name was Vardham\u0101na (\"the one who grows\") because of the kingdom's prosperity at the time of his birth. According to the Kalpasutras, he was called Mahavira (\"the great hero\") by the gods in the Kalpa S\u016btra because he remained steadfast in the midst of dangers, fears, hardships and calamities. He is also known as a tirthankara."

        "content": "It is universally accepted by scholars of Jainism that Mahavira lived in ancient India. According to the Digambara Uttarapurana text, Mahavira was born in Kundalpur in the Kingdom of the Videhas; the \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara Kalpa S\u016btra uses the name \"Kundagrama\", said to be located in present-day Bihar, India. Although it is thought to be the town of Basu Kund, about  north of Patna (the capital of Bihar), his birthplace remains a subject of dispute. Mahavira renounced his material wealth and left home when he was twenty-eight, by some accounts (thirty by others), lived an ascetic life for twelve and a years In which he did not even sit for a time, attained Kevalgyana and then preached Jainism for thirty years. Where he preached has been a subject of disagreement between the two major traditions of Jainism: \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara and  Digambara traditions. Mahavira was born in 599BCE and died in 527BCE. The Barli Inscription in Prakrit language which was inscribed in 443 BCE (year 84 of the Vira Nirvana Samvat), contains the line Viraya Bhagavate chaturasiti vase, which can be interpreted as \"dedicated to Lord Vira in his 84th year\", 84 years after the Nirvana of the Mahavira. However, paleographic analysis dates the inscription to the 2nd-1st century BCE. According to Buddhist and Jain texts they are believed to have been contemporaries which is supported by much ancient Buddhist literature. The Vira Nirvana Samvat era began in 527BCE (with Mahavira's nirvana) and is a firmly-established part of Jain tradition. The 12th-century Jain scholar Hemachandracharya placed Mahavira in the 5thcentury BCE. According to Jain, the traditional date of 527BCE is accurate; the Buddha was younger than Mahavira and \"might have attained nirvana a few years later\". The place of his nirvana, Pavapuri in present-day Bihar, is a pilgrimage site for Jains."

The Ikshvaku Dynasty was founded by the First Tirthankara Rishabhanatha. According to Jains, Mahavira was born in 599BCE. His birthday falls on the thirteenth day of the rising moon in the month of Chaitra in the Vira Nirvana Samvat calendar era. It falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar, and is celebrated by Jains as Mahavir Janma Kalyanak. Kundagrama (the place of Mahavira's birth) is traditionally believed to be near Vaishali, an ancient town on the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Its location in present-day Bihar is unclear, partly because of migrations from ancient Bihar for economic and political reasons. According to the \"Universal History\" in Jain texts, Mahavira underwent many rebirths (total 27 births) before his 6th-century birth. They included a denizen of hell, a lion, and a god (deva) in a heavenly realm just before his last birth as the 24th tirthankara. Svetambara texts state that his embryo first formed in a Brahman woman before it was transferred by Hari-Naigamesin (the divine commander of Indra's army) to the womb of Trishala, Siddhartha's wife. The embryo-transfer legend is not believed by adherents of the Digambara tradition. Jain texts state that after Mahavira was born, the god Indra came from the heavens along with 56 digkumaries, anointed him, and performed his abhisheka (consecration) on Mount Meru. These events, illustrated in a number of Jain temples, play a part in modern Jain temple rituals. Although the Kalpa S\u016btra accounts of Mahavira's birth legends are recited by Svetambara Jains during the annual Paryushana festival, the same festival is observed by the Digambaras without the recitation."

His chief disciple, Gautama, is said to have attained omniscience the night that Mahavira achieved nirvana from Pawapuri. Accounts of Mahavira's nirvana vary among Jain texts, with some describing a simple nirvana and others recounting grandiose celebrations attended by gods and kings. According to the Jinasena's Mahapurana, heavenly beings arrived to perform his funeral rites. The Pravachanasara of Digambara tradition says that only the nails and hair of tirthankaras are left behind; the rest of the body dissolves in the air like camphor. In some texts Mahavira is described, at age 72, as delivering his final preaching over a six-day period to a large group of people. The crowd falls asleep, awakening to find that he has disappeared (leaving only his nails and hair, which his followers cremate). The Jain \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara tradition believes that Mahavira's nirvana occurred in 527 BCE, and the Digambara tradition holds that date of 468 BCE. In both traditions, his jiva (soul) is believed to abide in Siddhashila (the home of liberated souls). Mahavira's Jal Mandir stands at the place where he is said to have attained nirvana (moksha). Artworks in Jain temples and texts depict his final liberation and cremation, sometimes shown symbolically as a small pyre of sandalwood and a piece of burning camphor."

Attempts were made by later monks to gather, recite the canon, and re-establish it. These efforts identified differences in recitations of Mahavira's teachings, and an attempt was made in the 5thcentury CE to reconcile the differences. The reconciliation efforts failed, with Svetambara and Digambara Jain traditions holding their own incomplete, somewhat-different versions of Mahavira's teachings. In the early centuries of the common era, Jain texts containing Mahavira's teachings were written in palm-leaf manuscripts. According to the Digambaras, \u0100ch\u0101rya Bhutabali was the last ascetic with partial knowledge of the original canon.

According to Chakravarthi, these teachings help improve a person's quality of life. However, Dundas writes that Mahavira's emphasis on non-violence and restraint has been interpreted by some Jain scholars to \"not be driven by merit from giving or compassion to other creatures, nor a duty to rescue all creatures\" but by \"continual self discipline\": a cleansing of the soul which leads to spiritual development and release. Mahavira is best remembered in the Indian traditions for his teaching that ahimsa is the supreme moral virtue. He taught that ahimsa covers all living beings, and injuring any being in any form creates bad karma (which affects one's rebirth, future well-being, and suffering). According to Mahatma Gandhi, Mahavira was the greatest authority on ahimsa."

To Mahavira, the metaphysical nature of the universe consists of dravya, jiva, and ajiva (inanimate objects). The jiva is bound to sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (transmigration) because of karma (the effects of one's actions). Karma, in Jainism, includes actions and intent; it colors the soul (lesya), affecting how, where, and as what a soul is reborn after death. According to Mahavira, there is no creator deity and existence has neither beginning nor end. Gods and demons exist in Jainism, however, whose jivas a part of the same cycle of birth and death. The goal of spiritual practice is to liberate the jiva from its karmic accumulation and enter the realm of the siddhas, souls who are liberated from rebirth.

        "content": "Mahavira taught the doctrine of anekantavada (many-sided reality). Although the word does not appear in the earliest Jain literature or the Agamas, the doctrine is illustrated in Mahavira's answers to questions posed by his followers. Truth and reality are complex, and have a number of aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is impossible to express it fully with language alone; human attempts to communicate are nayas (\"partial expression[s] of the truth\"). Language itself is not truth, but a means of expressing it. From truth, according to Mahavira, language returns\u2014not the other way around. One can experience the \"truth\" of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempt to express the experience is sy\u0101t: valid \"in some respect\", but still a \"perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete\". Spiritual truths are also complex, with multiple aspects, and language cannot express their plurality; however, they can be experienced through effort and appropriate karma. Mahavira's anekantavada doctrine is also summarized in Buddhist texts such as the Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta (in which he is called Nigantha N\u0101taputta), and is a key difference between the teachings of Mahavira and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting the extremes of \"it is\" or \"it is not\"; Mahavira accepted both \"it is\" and \"it is not\", with reconciliation and the qualification of \"perhaps\". The Jain Agamas suggest that Mahavira's approach to answering metaphysical, philosophical questions was a \"qualified yes\" (sy\u0101t). A version of this doctrine is also found in the Ajivika school of ancient Indian philosophy. According to Dundas, the anekantavada doctrine has been interpreted by many Jains as \"promot[ing] a universal religious tolerance ... plurality ... [and a] ... benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions\"; however, this misreads Jain historical texts and Mahavira's teachings. Mahavira's \"many pointedness, multiple perspective\" teachings are a doctrine about the nature of reality and human existence, not about tolerating religious positions such as sacrificing animals (or killing them for food) or violence against nonbelievers (or any other living being) as \"perhaps right\". The five vows for Jain monks and nuns are strict requirements, with no \"perhaps\". Mahavira's Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism beyond the renunciant Jain communities, but each religion was \"highly critical of the knowledge systems and ideologies of their rivals\"."

It was disputed whether a female mendicant (sadhvi) could achieve the spiritual liberation of a male mendicant (sadhu) through asceticism. The major Jain traditions have disagreed, with Digambaras (the sky-clad, naked mendicant order) believing that a woman is unable to fully practice asceticism and cannot achieve spiritual liberation because of her gender; she can, at best, live an ethical life so she is reborn as a man. According to this view, women are seen as a threat to a monk's chastity. Mahavira had preached about men and women equality. The clothes-wearing Svetambaras have interpreted Mahavira's teaching as encouraging both sexes to pursue a mendicant, ascetic life with the possibility of moksha (kaivalya, spiritual liberation)."

Mahavira preached that the nature of existence is cyclic, and the soul is reborn after death in one of the trilokthe heavenly, hellish, or earthly realms of existence and suffering. Humans are reborn, depending on one's karma (actions) as a human, animal, element, microbe, or other form, on earth or in a heavenly (or hellish) realm. Nothing is permanent; everyone (including gods, demons and earthly beings) dies and is reborn, based on their actions in their previous life.

Although Mahavira is sometimes placed in Parshvanatha's lineage, this is contradicted by texts stating that Mahavira renounced the world alone. Parshvanatha was born 273 years before Mahavira. Parshvanatha, a tirthankara whom modern Western historians consider a historical figure, lived in about the 8th century BCE. Jain texts suggest that Mahavira's parents were lay devotees of Parshvanatha. When Mahavira revived the Jain community in the 6th century BCE, ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule. The followers of Parshvanatha vowed to observe ahimsa; this obligation was part of their caujjama dhamma (Fourfold Restraint). According to Dundas, Jains believe that the lineage of Parshvanatha influenced Mahavira. Parshvanatha, as the one who \"removes obstacles and has the capacity to save\", is a popular icon; his image is the focus of Jain temple devotion. Of the 24 tirthankaras, Jain iconography has celebrated Mahavira and Parshvanatha the most; sculptures discovered at the Mathura archaeological site have been dated to the 1stcentury BCE. According to Moriz Winternitz, Mahavira may be considered a reformer of an existing Jain sect known as Niganthas (fetter-less) which was mentioned in early Buddhist texts. The Barli Inscription dating back to 443 BCE contains the line Viraya Bhagavate chaturasiti vase, which can be interpreted as \"dedicated to Lord Vira in his 84th year\"."

He is known for his own political prominence as well as that of his children and was the patriarch of the Irish-American Kennedy family, which included President John F. Kennedy and Senator Edward M. \"Ted\" Kennedy. Kennedy was born to a political family in East Boston, Massachusetts. He made a large fortune as a stock market and commodity investor and later rolled over his profits by investing in real estate and a wide range of business industries across the United States. During World War I, he was an assistant general manager of a Boston area Bethlehem Steel shipyard; through that position, he became acquainted with Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. In the 1920s, Kennedy made huge profits by reorganizing and refinancing several Hollywood studios; several acquisitions were ultimately merged into Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) Studios. Kennedy increased his fortune with distribution rights for Scotch whisky. He owned the largest privately owned building in the country, Chicago's Merchandise Mart. Kennedy was a leading member of the Democratic Party and of the Irish Catholic community. President Roosevelt appointed Kennedy to be the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which he led from 1934 to 1935. Kennedy later directed the Maritime Commission. Kennedy served as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1938 to late 1940. With the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Kennedy was pessimistic about Britain's ability to survive attacks from Nazi Germany. During the Battle of Britain in November 1940, Kennedy publicly suggested, \"Democracy is finished in England. It may be here [in the United States].\" After a controversy regarding this statement, Kennedy resigned his position. Kennedy was married to Rose Kennedy and had nine children. During his later life, he was heavily involved in the political careers of his sons. Three of Kennedy's sons attained distinguished political positions: John F. Kennedy (1917\u20131963) served as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and as the 35th president of the United States, Robert F. Kennedy (1925\u20131968) served as the U.S. attorney general and as a U.S. senator from New York, and Ted Kennedy (1932\u20132009) also served as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts."

In 1913, the Columbia Trust Bank, in which his father held a significant share, was under threat of takeover. Kennedy borrowed $45,000 (equivalent to about $\u00a0million today) from family and friends and bought back control. At the age of 25, he was rewarded by being elected the bank's president. Kennedy told the press he was \"the youngest\" bank president in America. Kennedy emerged as a highly successful entrepreneur who had an eye for value. For example, he was a real estate investor who turned a handsome profit from ownership of Old Colony Realty Associates, Inc., which bought distressed real estate. Although he was skeptical of American involvement in World War I, Kennedy sought to participate in wartime production as an assistant general manager of Fore River, a major Bethlehem Steel shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. There, he oversaw the production of transports and warships. Through this job, he became acquainted with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt."

He helped establish a \"stock pool\" to control trading in the stock of glassmaker Libbey-Owens-Ford. The arrangement drove up the value of the pool operators' holdings in the stock by using insider information and the public's lack of knowledge. Pool operators would bribe journalists to present information in the most advantageous manner. Pool operators tried to corner a stock and drive the price up, or drive the price down with a \"bear raid\". Kennedy got into a bidding war for control of Yellow Cab Company. Kennedy later claimed he understood that the rampant stock speculation of the late 1920s would lead to a market crash. Supposedly, he said that he knew it was time to get out of the market when he received stock tips from a shoe-shine boy. Kennedy survived the crash \"because he possessed a passion for facts, a complete lack of sentiment and a marvelous sense of timing\". During the Great Depression, Kennedy vastly increased his fortune by investing most of his money in real estate. In 1929, Kennedy's fortune was estimated to be $4\u00a0million (equivalent to $ today). By 1935, his wealth had increased to $180\u00a0million (equivalent to $ today)."

        "content": "Kennedy made huge profits from reorganizing and refinancing several Hollywood film studios. Film production in the U.S. was much more decentralized than it is today, with many different movie studios producing film product. One small studio was Film Booking Offices of America (or FBO), which specialized in Westerns produced cheaply. Its owner was in financial trouble, and asked Kennedy to help find a new owner. Kennedy formed his own group of investors and bought it for $1.5\u00a0million. In March 1926, Kennedy moved to Hollywood to focus on running film studios. At that time, film studios were permitted to own exhibition companies, which were necessary to get their films on local screens. With that in mind, in a hostile buyout, he acquired the Keith-Albee-Orpheum Theaters Corporation (KAO), which had more than 700 vaudeville theaters across the United States that had begun showing movies. He later purchased another production studio called Pathe Exchange, and merged those two entities with Cecil B. DeMille's Producers Distributing Corporation in March 1927. In August 1928, he unsuccessfully tried to run First National Pictures. In October 1928, he formally merged his film companies FBO and KAO to form Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) and made a large amount of money in the process. Then, keen to buy the Pantages Theatre chain, which had 63 profitable theaters, Kennedy made an offer of $8\u00a0million ($ today). It was declined. He then stopped distributing his movies to Pantages. Still, Alexander Pantages declined to sell. However, when Pantages was later charged and tried for rape, his reputation took a battering, and he accepted Kennedy's revised offer of $3.5\u00a0million ($ today). Pantages, who claimed that Kennedy had \"set him up\", was later found not guilty at a second trial. The girl who had accused Pantages of rape, Eunice Pringle, confessed on her deathbed that Kennedy was the mastermind of the plot to frame Pantages. Many estimate that Kennedy made over $5\u00a0million ($ today) from his investments in Hollywood. During his three-year affair with film star Gloria Swanson, he arranged the financing for her films The Love of Sunya (1927) and the ill-fated Queen Kelly (1928). The duo also used Hollywood's famous \"body sculptor\", masseuse Sylvia of Hollywood. Their relationship ended when Swanson discovered that an expensive gift from Kennedy had been charged to her account. As soon as it became legal to do so, Kennedy imported large shipments of high-priced Scotch and made a large profit. Various contradictory \"bootlegging\" stories circulated but historians have not accepted them. At the start of the Franklin Roosevelt administration in March 1933, Kennedy and future Congressman James Roosevelt II founded Somerset Importers, an entity that acted as the exclusive American agent for Haig & Haig Scotch, Gordon's Dry Gin and Dewar's Scotch. Kennedy kept his Somerset company for years. Kennedy himself drank little alcohol. He so disapproved of what he considered a stereotypical Irish vice that he offered his sons $1,000 not to drink until they turned 21. Kennedy invested his profits from alcohol into residential and commercial real estate in New York, the Le Pavillon restaurant, and the Hialeah Park Race Track in Hialeah, Florida. In addition, Kennedy purchased spirits-importation rights from Schenley Industries, a firm in Canada. His most important purchase was the largest privately owned building in the country, Chicago's Merchandise Mart."

        "content": "In 1932, Kennedy supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in his bid for the presidency. This was his first major involvement in a national political campaign, and he donated, loaned, and raised a substantial amount of money for the campaign. In 1934, Congress established the independent Securities and Exchange Commission to end irresponsible market manipulations and dissemination of false information about securities. Roosevelt's brain trust drew up a list of recommended candidates for the SEC chairmanship. Kennedy headed the list, which stated he was \"the best bet for Chairman because of executive ability, knowledge of habits and customs of business to be regulated and ability to moderate different points of view on Commission.\" Kennedy sought out the best lawyers available giving him a hard-driving team with a mission for reform. They included William O. Douglas and Abe Fortas, both of whom were later named to the Supreme Court.  The SEC had four missions. First was to restore investor confidence in the securities market, which had collapsed on account of its questionability, and the external threats supposedly posed by anti-business elements in the Roosevelt administration. Second, the SEC had to get rid of penny-ante swindles based on false information, fraudulent devices, and get-rich-quick schemes. Thirdly, and much more important than the frauds, the SEC had to end the million-dollar maneuvers in major corporations, whereby insiders with access to high-quality information about the company knew when to buy or sell their own securities. A crackdown on insider trading was essential. Finally, the SEC had to set up a complex system of registration for all securities sold in America, with a clear set of rules, deadlines and guidelines that all companies had to follow. The main challenge faced by the young lawyers was drafting precise rules. The SEC succeeded in its four missions, as Kennedy reassured the American business community that they would no longer be deceived and taken advantage of by Wall Street. He trumpeted for ordinary investors to return to the market and enable the economy to grow again. Kennedy's reforming work as SEC Chairman was widely praised on all sides, as investors realized the SEC was protecting their interests. He resigned from the SEC in 1935."

Having been a strong supporter of Roosevelt since 1932, in 1934 Coughlin broke with the president, who became a bitter opponent of Coughlin's weekly anti-communist, anti-Semitic, far-right, anti\u2013Federal Reserve and isolationist radio talks. Roosevelt sent Kennedy and other prominent Irish Catholics to try to tone down Coughlin. Coughlin swung his support to Huey Long in 1935 and then to William Lemke's Union Party in 1936. Kennedy strongly supported the New Deal (Father Coughlin believed that the New Deal did not go far enough \u2013 indeed that Franklin Roosevelt was a tool of the rich) and reportedly believed as early as 1933 that Coughlin was \"becoming a very dangerous proposition\" as an opponent of Roosevelt and \"an out and out demagogue\". In 1936, Kennedy worked with Roosevelt, Bishop Francis Spellman and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) to shut Coughlin down. When Coughlin returned to the air in 1940, Kennedy continued to battle against his influence among Irish Americans. Despite his public disputes with Coughlin, it has also been acknowledged that Kennedy would also accompany Coughlin whenever the priest visited Roosevelt at Hyde Park. A historian with History News Network also stated that Coughlin was in fact a friend of Kennedy as well. In a Boston Post article of August 16, 1936, Coughlin referred to Kennedy as the \"shining star among the dim 'knights' in the [Roosevelt] Administration.\""

Kennedy allegedly told Klemmer that \"[some] individual Jews are all right, Harvey, but as a race they stink. They spoil everything they touch.\" When Klemmer returned from a trip to Germany and reported the pattern of vandalism and assaults on Jews by Nazis, Kennedy responded, \"Well, they brought it on themselves.\" On June 13, 1938, Kennedy met in London with Herbert von Dirksen, the German ambassador to the United Kingdom, who claimed upon his return to Berlin that Kennedy had told him that \"it was not so much the fact that we want to get rid of the Jews that was so harmful to us, but rather the loud clamor with which we accompanied this purpose. [Kennedy] himself fully understood our Jewish policy.\" Kennedy's main concern with such violent acts against German Jews as Kristallnacht was that they generated bad publicity in the West for the Nazi regime, a concern that he communicated in a letter to Charles Lindbergh. Kennedy had a close friendship with Viscountess Astor, and their correspondence is replete with anti-Semitic statements. According to Edward Renehan: By August 1940, Kennedy worried that a third term for President Roosevelt would mean war. Laurence Leamer in The Kennedy Men: 1901\u20131963 reports: \"Joe believed that Roosevelt, Churchill, the Jews, and their allies would manipulate America into approaching Armageddon.\" Nevertheless, Kennedy supported Roosevelt's third term in return for Roosevelt's promise to support Joseph Kennedy Jr. in a run for Governor of Massachusetts in 1942. However, even during the darkest months of World War II, Kennedy remained \"more wary of\" prominent American Jews, such as Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, than he was of Hitler."

Roosevelt urgently needed his support to hold the Catholic vote and invited him to spend the night at the White House. Kennedy agreed to make a nationwide radio speech to advocate Roosevelt's reelection. Roosevelt was pleased with the speech because, Nasaw says, it successfully \"rallied reluctant Irish Catholic voters to his side, buttressed his claims that he was not going to take the nation into war, and emphasized that he alone had the experience to lead the nation in these difficult times.\" After Roosevelt was reelected, Kennedy submitted his resignation as ambassador. Throughout the rest of the war, relations between Kennedy and the Roosevelt Administration remained tense, especially when Joe Jr. vocally opposed President Roosevelt's unprecedented nomination for a third term, which began in 1941. Kennedy may have wanted to run for president himself in 1940 or later. Having effectively removed himself from the national stage, Joe Sr. sat out World War II on the sidelines. Kennedy stayed active in the smaller venues of rallying Irish-American and Roman Catholic Democrats to vote for Roosevelt's re-election for a fourth term in 1944. Former Ambassador Kennedy claimed to be eager to help the war effort, but as a result of his previous gaffes, he was neither trusted nor invited to do so."

Even before McCarthy became famous in 1950, Kennedy had forged close ties with the Republican Senator. Kennedy often brought him to his family compound at Hyannis Port as a weekend house guest in the late 1940s. McCarthy at one point dated Patricia Kennedy. When McCarthy became a dominant voice of anti-Communism starting in 1950, Kennedy contributed thousands of dollars to McCarthy, and became one of his major supporters. In the Senate race of 1952, Kennedy apparently worked a deal so that McCarthy, a Republican, would not make campaign speeches for the Republican ticket in Massachusetts. In return, Congressman John F. Kennedy, running for the Senate seat, would not give any anti-McCarthy speeches that his liberal supporters wanted to hear. At Kennedy's urging in 1953, McCarthy hired Robert F. Kennedy (aged 27) as a senior staff member of the Senate's investigations subcommittee, which McCarthy chaired. In 1954, when the Senate was threatening to condemn McCarthy, Senator John Kennedy faced a dilemma. \"How could I demand that Joe McCarthy be censured for things he did when my own brother was on his staff?\" asked JFK. By 1954, Robert F. Kennedy and McCarthy's chief aide Roy Cohn had fallen out with each other, and Robert no longer worked for McCarthy. John Kennedy had a speech drafted calling for the censure of McCarthy, but never delivered it. When the Senate voted to censure McCarthy on December 2, 1954, Senator Kennedy was in a hospital and never indicated how he would cast his vote. Joe Kennedy strongly supported McCarthy to the end."

Kennedy had been consigned to the political shadows after his remarks during World War II (\"Democracy is finished\"), and he remained an intensely controversial figure among U.S. citizens because of his suspect business credentials, his Roman Catholicism, his opposition to Roosevelt's foreign policy, and his support for Joseph McCarthy. Although his own ambitions to achieve the White House were thwarted, Kennedy held out great hope for his eldest son, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., to seek the presidency. However, Joe Jr., who had become a U.S. Navy bomber pilot, was killed over the English Channel in August 1944 while undertaking Operation Anvil. After grieving over his dead son, Joe Sr. turned his attention to his second son, John, for a run for the presidency. When John F. Kennedy was asked about the level of involvement and influence that his father had held in his razor-thin presidential victory over Richard Nixon, he would joke that on the eve of the election his father had asked him the exact number of votes he would need to win: There was no way he was paying \"for a landslide\". Kennedy was one of four fathers (the other three being George Tryon Harding, Nathaniel Fillmore, and George Herbert Walker Bush) to live through the entire presidency of a son. Historian Richard J. Whalen describes Kennedy's influence on John F. Kennedy's policy decisions in his biography of Kennedy.

(Accounts of Rosemary's life indicated that she was intellectually disabled, although some have raised questions about the Kennedys' accounts of the nature and scope of her disability.) Rosemary's erratic behavior frustrated her parents; her father was especially worried that she would shame and embarrass the family and damage his political career and that of his other children. Kennedy requested that surgeons perform a lobotomy on Rosemary. The lobotomy took place in November 1941. Kennedy did not inform his wife about the procedure until after it was completed. James W. Watts and Walter Freeman (both of George Washington University School of Medicine) performed the surgery. The lobotomy was a disaster. It left Rosemary Kennedy permanently incapacitated. Her mental capacity diminished to that of a two-year-old child; she could not walk or speak intelligibly and was incontinent. Following the lobotomy, Rosemary was immediately institutionalized. In 1949, she was relocated to Jefferson, Wisconsin, where she lived for the rest of her life on the grounds of the St. Coletta School for Exceptional Children (formerly known as \"St. Coletta Institute for Backward Youth\"). Kennedy did not visit his daughter at the institution. In Rosemary: The Hidden Kennedy Daughter, author Kate Clifford Larson stated that Rosemary's lobotomy was hidden from the family for twenty years. In 1961, after Kennedy suffered a stroke that left him unable to speak, his children were made aware of Rosemary's location. The lobotomy did not become public knowledge until 1987. Rosemary Kennedy died from natural causes on January 7, 2005, at the age of 86. Dr. Bertram S. Brown, director of the National Institute of Mental Health who was previously an aide to President Kennedy, told a Kennedy biographer that Kennedy referred to Rosemary as mentally retarded rather than mentally ill in order to protect his son John's reputation for a presidential run. Brown added that the family's \"lack of support for mental illness\" was \"part of a lifelong family denial of what was really so\".Kessler, pp. 252\u2013253."

        "content": "Murlidhar Devidas \"Baba\" Amte was born in an affluent Deshastha Brahmin family on 26 December 1914 in the city of Hinganghat in Maharashtra. His father, Devidas Amte, was. a colonial government officer working  for the  district administration and revenue collection departments. Murlidhar Amte acquired the nickname Baba in his childhood. His wife, Sadhanatai Amte, explains that he came to be known as Baba not because \"he was regarded as a saint or a holy person, but because his parents addressed him by that name.\" Amte was the eldest of eight children. As the eldest son of a wealthy land owner, he had an idyllic childhood, filled with hunting and sports. By the time he was fourteen, he owned his own gun and hunted bear and deer. When he was old enough to drive, he was given a Singer Sports car with cushions covered with panther skin. Though he was born in a wealthy family he was always aware of the class inequality that prevailed in Indian society. \"There is a certain callousness in families like my family,\" he used to say. \"They put up strong barriers so as to avoid seeing the misery in the outside world and I rebelled against it.\""

        "content": "Trained in law, he developed a successful legal practice in Wardha. He soon became involved in the Indian independence movement and, in 1942, began working as a defense lawyer for Indian leaders imprisoned by the colonial government for their involvement in the Quit India movement. He spent some time at Sevagram, at the ashram started by Mahatma Gandhi and became a follower of Gandhism. He practiced Gandhism by engaging in yarn spinning using a charkha and wearing khadi. When Gandhi got to know that Dr. Amte had defended a girl from the lewd taunts of some British soldiers, Gandhi gave him the name \u2013 Abhay Sadhak (Fearless Seeker of Truth). However one day his encounter with a living corpse and leprosy patient Tulshiram, filled him with fear. Amte,who never feared for anything till that incident and who fought one time with British men to save the honour of an Indian lady and was also challenged by sweepers of Warora to clean the gutters, was quivered in fright on seeing plight of Tulshiram. However,Amte wanted to create a thinking and understanding that leprosy patients can be truly helped only when a society is free of \"Mental Leprosy\"-fear and wrong understanding associated with disease. To dispel this thinking he once injected himself with bacilli from a patient, to prove the ailment was not highly contagious. In those days, people with leprosy suffered a social stigma and Indian society disowned these people. Amte strove to dispel the widespread belief that leprosy was highly contagious; he even allowed bacilli from a leper to be injected into him as part of an experiment aimed at proving that leprosy was not highly contagious. But Baba Amte and his wife used to prioritise the care and treatment and mainstreaming those affected by the dreaded disease of leprosy and lived amongst the affected and ensured that they got exemplary medical care which ended the scourge of the disease for them. For the rehabilitated and cured patients he arranged vocational training and small-scale manufacturing of handicrafts and got things crafted by them. He struggled and tried to remove the stigma and ignorance surrounding the treatment of leprosy as a disease. Amte founded three ashrams for treatment and rehabilitation of leprosy patients, disabled people and people from marginalised sections of general society in Maharashtra. On 15 August 1949, he and his wife Sadhna Amte started a leprosy hospital in Anandvan under a tree. The leprosy patients were provided with medical care and a life of dignity engaged in agriculture and various small and medium industries like handicrafts. In 1973, Amte founded the Lok Biradari Prakalp to work for the Madia Gond tribal people of Gadchiroli District. Baba Amte also involved in other social cause initiatives like,in year 1985 he launched the first Knit India Mission for peace-at 72 years he walked from Kanyakumari to Kashmir,a distance of more than 3000 miles,to inspire unity among Indian people and organised second march three years later travelling over 1800 miles from Assam to Gujarat. He also participated in Narmada Bachao Andolan in year 1990,leaving Anandwan and lived on banks of Narmada for seven years. Amte devoted his life to many other social causes, most notably the Quit India movement and attempting to raise public awareness on the importance of ecological balance, wildlife preservation and the Narmada Bachao Andolan. The Indian Government awarded Baba Amte with a Padma Shri in 1971."

Prakash and his wife Mandakini run a school and a hospital at Hemalkasa village in the underprivileged district of Gadchiroli in Maharashtra among the Madia Gond tribe, as well as an orphanage for injured wild animals, including a lion and some leopards. She left her governmental medical  and moved to Hemalkasa to start the projects after they married. Their two sons, Dr. Digant and Aniket also dedicated their lives to the same causes. In 2008, Prakash and Mandakini received the Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership. Amte's elder son Vikas and his wife Bharati run the hospital at Anandwan and co-ordinate operations with satellite projects. Anandwan has a university, an orphanage, and schools for the blind and the deaf. The Anandwan ashram is self-sufficient and has over 5,000 residents.

        "content": "Byers' first real band was formed in Coventry in 1975 and were called The Wild Boys. It was in The Wild Boys that he started songwriting. His first was \"1980's Teddy Boy\", and later came \"Concrete Jungle\" which was recorded by The Specials for their debut album, Specials (1979). Byers joined The Specials when the band was called The Coventry Automatics and wrote several songs for the band. The most successful was \"Rat Race\", which peaked at number five in the UK Singles Chart in May 1980. Byers also wrote \"Hey Little Rich Girl\", which appeared on The Specials second album, More Specials (1980). \"Hey Little Rich Girl\" was released as a single in Japan by Chrysalis in 1980, and covered by Amy Winehouse on her successful album Back To Black. Byers sang the lead vocal on \"Concrete Jungle\" and the track \"Braggin' and Tryin' Not to Lie\" which was released as a free single with initial copies of More Specials. \"Braggin' and Tryin' Not to Lie\" was credited to Roddy Radiation & The Specials. After The Specials split in 1981, Byers was dropped by Chrysalis before he re-emerged with The Tearjerkers, a band that he had begun in the last months of The Specials. The band played numerous gigs and gained a cult following. The band originally were Roddy Byers (vocals/guitar), Mark Byers (vocals/guitar), Joe Hughes (vocals/bass), Pete Davies (drums) and Slim Tearjerker aka Clive Pain (vocals/keys/accordion). The later version was comprised Roddy Byers (vocals/guitar) Mark Byers (vocals/guitar) Badger (bass) and Tony Lynch (drums). The Tearjerkers were signed up by Chiswick Records in 1982, and released their debut single \"Desire\" b/w \"Western Song\". The band finally split in 1987 because, as Roddy commented, \"after seven years there was no major recording success\". The Bonediggers were formed shortly after the Tearjerkers ended in 1987. The band released a self-titled album on Rimshot Records the following year with a rawer, hard-edged rockabilly sound. The Bonediggers consisted of Roddy Radiation (vocals/guitar), David West (vocals/guitar), Sam Smith (bass), and Gary Muldoon (drums), later replaced by Jim Pryall. Byers still plays with Sam Smith to this day in The Skabilly Rebels. The Bonediggers would transition into The Raiders, shortly before Byers reunited with several members of the Specials to form The Specials MK2. Byers was an essential part of 'The Specials 2', who formed in the early 1990s after teaming up with Desmond Dekker for the King of Kings album. The group toured for a couple of years throughout the UK, America and Japan. They released two singles  \"Hypocrite\" and a cover of Toots & the Maytals \"Pressure Drop\". The band recorded two albums 1996 Today's Specials, a compilation of covers and 1998 Guilty 'til Proved Innocent! which were made up of original material. Byers contributed songs for latter's \"Tears in My Beer,\" \"Bonediggin',\" \"Keep on Learning\" and \"The Man With No Name\". After The Specials 2, Byers worked with the acoustic project, Three Men & Black, which consisted of Jean Jacques Burnel (The Stranglers), Jake Burns (Stiff Little Fingers), Pauline Black (The Selecter), Bruce Foxton (The Jam) and Dave Wakeling (The Beat, General Public) and Nick Welsh (Skaville UK). Byers' current band, The Skabilly Rebels, are based in Coventry. They are Roddy Byers - Lead Guitar & Vocals Adrian Lee - Sax & Keyboards Joe Harcourt  - 2nd Guitar backing Vocals, Connor O\u2019Connor - Bass guitar. Matt Hart. - drums. They released their debut album 'Blues Attack' at the end of 2009 and toured the United States in 2012 and regularly tour The UK, Ireland, and Europe."

His older brother, Isaac Robert, also followed in the family business as a caricaturist and illustrator. Cruikshank's early work was caricature; but in 1823, at the age of 31, he started to focus on book illustration. He illustrated the first, 1823 English translation (by Edgar Taylor and David Jardine) of Grimms' Fairy Tales, published in two volumes as German Popular Stories. On 16 October 1827, he married Mary Ann Walker (1807\u20131849). Two years after her death, on 7 March 1851, he married Eliza Widdison. The two lived at 263 Hampstead Road, North London. Cruikshank had fathered 11 illegitimate children with a mistress named Adelaide Attree, his former servant, who lived close to where he lived with his wife. Adelaide was ostensibly married and had taken the married surname 'Archibold'."

        "content": "Cruikshank's early career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications. He achieved early success collaborating with William Hone in his political satire The Political House That Jack Built (1819). In the same year he produced the now-infamous anti-abolitionist piece The New Union Club. It satirised a dinner party organised by abolitionists with black guests. While this piece was praised as \u201cthe finest of G.C.\u2019s caricatures\u201d during the 19th century, it is now viewed as one of the most racist prints of its era. His 1819 print, The Belle Alliance, or the Female Reformers of Blackburn!!!, criticised the role of women in the reform movement, portraying them as unfeminine and grotesque.His first major work was Pierce Egan's Life in London (1821) in which the characters Tom and Jerry, two 'men about town' visit various London locations and taverns to enjoy themselves and carouse. This was followed by The Comic Almanack (1835\u20131853) and Omnibus (1842). Cruikshank gained notoriety with his political prints that attacked the royal family and leading politicians. In 1820 he received a royal bribe of \u00a3100 for a pledge \"not to caricature His Majesty\" (George IV of the United Kingdom) \"in any immoral situation\". His work included a personification of England named John Bull who was developed from about 1790 in conjunction with other British satirical artists such as James Gillray, and Thomas Rowlandson. Cruikshank replaced one of his major influences, James Gillray, as England's most popular satirist. For a generation he delineated Tories, Whigs and Radicals impartially. Satirical material came to him from every public event\u00a0\u2013 wars abroad, the enemies of Britain (he was highly patriotic), the frolic, among other qualities, such as the weird and terrible, in which he excelled. His hostility to enemies of Britain and a crude racism is evident in his illustrations commissioned to accompany William Maxwell's History of the Irish rebellion in 1798 (1845) where his lurid depictions of incidents in the rebellion were characterised by the simian-like portrayal of Irish rebels.  Among the other racially engaged works of Cruikshank there were caricatures about the \"legal barbarities\" of the Chinese, the subject given by his friend, Dr. W. Gourley, a participant in the ideological battle around the Arrow War, 1856\u201360."

He also illustrated Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi (1838), which Dickens edited under his regular , \"Boz\". Cruikshank even acted in Dickens's amateur theatrical company. On 30 December 1871 Cruikshank published a letter in The Times which claimed credit for much of the plot of Oliver Twist. The letter launched a fierce controversy around who created the work. Cruikshank was not the first Dickens illustrator to make such a claim. Robert Seymour who illustrated the Pickwick Papers suggested that the idea for that novel was originally his; however, in his preface to the 1867 edition, Dickens strenuously denied any specific input. The friendship between Cruikshank and Dickens soured further when Cruikshank became a fanatical teetotaler in opposition to Dickens's views of moderation.

        "content": "In the late 1840s, Cruikshank's focus shifted from book illustration to an emphasis on alcohol temperance and anti-smoking. Formerly a heavy drinker, he now supported, lectured to, and supplied illustrations for the National Temperance Society and the Total Abstinence Society, among others. The best known of these are The Bottle, 8 plates (1847), with its sequel, The Drunkard's Children, 8 plates (1848), with the ambitious work, The Worship of Bacchus, published by subscription after the artist's oil painting, now in the Tate Gallery, London. For his efforts he was made vice president of the National Temperance League in 1856. When the invasion scare of 1859 led to the creation of the Volunteer Movement, Cruikshank was one of those who organised Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs). At first his unit was the 24th Surrey RVC, which recruited from working men who were total abstainers and was named 'Havelock's Own' in honour of Major-General Sir Henry Havelock, a hero of the Indian Mutiny and pioneer of Temperance Clubs in the army. However, Cruikshank received little encouragement from the Lord-Lieutenant of Surrey, and was rebuked for crossing into Kent to recruit. Disgusted, he disbanded his unit in 1862 and began anew in Middlesex, organising the 48th Middlesex RVC (Havelock's Temperance Volunteers). The unit ran into financial difficulties and when Cruikshank was forced to retire due to age, he was replaced as commanding officer by Lt-Col Cuthbert Vickers, a wealthy shipowner.  However, the Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette of 3 September 1868 reported that Cruikshank had resigned as Lieutenant-Colonel of the Volunteers \"in consequence, it is said, of the reinstatement in the service of certain officers of his corps who some time since had a difference with their Lieutenant-Colonel and were cashiered\". The 48th Middlesex merged with the 2nd City of London RVC, also a working-men's unit, composed mainly of printers from the Fleet Street area, and the combined unit had a long history as the City of London Rifles."

        "content": "Siegfried Alkan (30 March 1858 \u2013 24 December 1941) was a German composer. Alkan was born in Dillingen, Saarland (then Prussia, now Germany), the son of Johannes Alkan and Johanna Bonn in a family of merchants and musicians. Through his mother he was a distant cousin of the composers Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Fanny Hensel and Giacomo Meyerbeer. It is unknown whether he was related to the French composer and pianist Charles-Valentin Alkan, but like the latter, he was a scion of Jewish families from the Moselle region. In 1938 the octogenarian Siegfried Alkan became a victim of the \"Kristallnacht\". His instruments were destroyed and he himself was beaten by Nazi hordes. In his last years he was forced to wear the yellow star. Many works of Siegfried Alkan seem to be lost. Still known are for example the compositions \"Gru\u00df an die Saar\" (Op. 32), \"O w\u00fcsstest du's\" (Op. 39), \"Neues Saarlied\" (Op. 91) and \"Ur-Gro\u00dfm\u00fctterchen\" (Op. 80), which was very popular in the time after World War I."

        "content": "Herman Merivale CB (8 November 1806 \u2013 8 February 1874) was an English civil servant and historian.  He was the elder brother of Charles Merivale, and father of the poet Herman Charles Merivale. He was born at Dawlish, Devon to John Herman Merivale (1770\u20131844) and Louisa Heath Drury. He was educated at Harrow School.  In 1823 he entered Oriel College, Oxford. In 1825 he became a scholar of Trinity College and also won the Ireland scholarship, and three years later he was elected fellow of Balliol College.  He became a member of the Inner Temple and practised on the western circuit, being made in 1841 recorder of Falmouth, Helston and Penzance. From 1837 to 1842 he was professor of political economy at Oxford in this capacity he delivered a course of lectures on the British Colonies in which he dealt with questions of emigration, employment of labour and the allotment of public lands.  The reputation he secured by these lectures had much to do with his appointment in 1847 as Assistant Under-Secretary for the colonies, and in the next year he became Permanent Under-Secretary.  In 1859 he was transferred to the permanent under-secretaryship for India, receiving the distinction of CB.  In 1870, Merivale was awarded the degree of DCL by Oxford University. He died in 1874 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. Besides his Lectures on Colonization and Colonies (1841), he published Historical Studies (1865), and completed the Memoirs of Sir Philip Francis (1867); he wrote the second volume of the Life of Sir Henry Lawrence (1872) in continuation of Sir Herbert Edwardes's work. A tribute to his powers as an original thinker by his chief at the Colonial Office, Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, is printed with a notice of his career which his brother contributed to the Transactions (1884) of the Devonshire Association."

He was born in Sopot, a town in the Rose Valley of Bulgaria (then part of the Ottoman Empire). The works of Ivan Vazov reveal two historical epochs - the Bulgarian Renaissance and the Post-Liberation (from Ottoman Empire rule) epoch. Ivan Vazov holds the highest honorary title of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences - Academician. He acted as Education and People Enlightenment Minister from September 7, 1897, until January 30, 1899, representing the People's Party."

        "content": "The exact date of Vazov's birth is disputed. His parents, Saba and Mincho Vazov, both had a lot of influence on the young poet. After Ivan finished primary school in Sopot, Mincho sent him to Kalofer, appointing him assistant teacher. Having done his final exams in Kalofer, the young teacher returned to Sopot to help in his father's grocery. The following year his father sent him to Plovdiv to Naiden Gerov's school. There Vazov made his first steps as a poet. He returned to Sopot only to leave for Olteni\u021ba in Romania, as his father wanted him to become an apprentice and study trade at his uncle's. Ivan Vazov showed no interest in the trade profession whatsoever. Instead he was immersed in literature. Soon he fled from his uncle's place and went to Br\u0103ila where he lived with the Bulgarian exiled revolutionaries and met Hristo Botev, a Bulgarian revolutionary and poet. In 1874, he joined the struggle for his country's independence from the Ottoman Empire. He returned to Sopot in 1875, where he became a member of the local revolutionary committee. After the failure of the April Uprising of 1876, he had to flee the country, going back to Gala\u0163i, where most of the surviving revolutionaries were exiled. There he was appointed a secretary of the committee. Vazov was probably heavily influenced by Botev, who was the ideological leader of the Bulgarian revolutionary movement. He started writing his famous poems with Botev and some other Bulgarian emigrants in Romania. In 1876 he published his first work, Priaporetz and Gusla, followed by \"Bulgaria's Sorrows\" in 1877. Bulgaria regained its independence in 1878 as a result of the Russo-Turkish War and Vazov wrote the famous Epic of the Forgotten. He became the editor of the political reviews Science and Dawn. He was, however, forced into exile once again, this time to Odessa, because of the persecution of the russophile political faction. Returning to Bulgaria with the help of his mother Suba Vazova, he started teaching. Vazov's next stay was in Svishtov, where he became a civil servant. He moved to Sofia in 1889 where he started publishing the review Dennitsa. Vazov's 1888 novel Under the Yoke, which depicts the Ottoman oppression of Bulgaria, is the most famous piece of classic Bulgarian literature and has been translated into over 30 languages. Later in his life Vazov was a prominent and widely respected figure in the social and cultural life of newly independent Bulgaria. He died on September 22, 1921."

In 1865 he was elected to the House of Commons for Exeter for the Liberal Party. He made a favourable impression on the leaders of his party and when the Liberals came to office in 1868 under William Ewart Gladstone, Coleridge was appointed Solicitor-General. In 1871 he was promoted to Attorney-General, a post he held until 1873. In 1871 he was also involved in the high-publicity Tichborne Case. In 1873 he was described by the Manchester-based Women's Suffrage Journal as a \"firm and consistent\" supporter of women's suffrage. In November 1873 Coleridge succeeded Sir William Bovill as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and in January 1874 was raised to the peerage as Baron Coleridge, of Ottery St Mary in the County of Devon. In 1875, the three English common law courts (the Court of Queen's Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Court of the Exchequer) merged to become divisions of the new High Court of Justice. The head of each court (Lord Chief Justice Sir Alexander Cockburn, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas Lord Coleridge, and Chief Baron of the Exchequer Sir Fitzroy Kelly) continued in post. After the deaths of Kelly and Cockburn in 1880, the three divisions were merged into a single division, with Lord Coleridge as Lord Chief Justice of England. In 1884, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. Despite his health failing towards the end of his life he remained in this office until his death on 14 June 1894, aged 74."

        "content": "In 1840 he was apprenticed to his father's printing business in London, being subsequently taken into partnership. The firm was afterwards known as Blades, East & Blades. His interest in printing led him to make a study of the volumes produced by William Caxton's press, and of the early history of printing in England. His Life and Typography of William Caxton, England's First Printer, was published in 1861\u20131863, and the conclusions which he set forth were arrived at by a careful examination of types in the early books, each class of type being traced from its first use to the time when, spoilt by wear, it passed out of Caxton's hands. Some 450 volumes from the Caxton Press were thus carefully compared and classified in chronological order. In 1877 Blades took an active part in organizing the Caxton celebration, and strongly supported the foundation of the Library Association. He was a keen collector of old books, prints and medals. His publications relate chiefly to the early history of printing. The Enemies of Books was his most popular work, being produced in 1880. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1882. On his death, his library was acquired by the St Bride Foundation as the initial collection of the library. The architect of the St Bride Foundation building, Robert Cunningham Murray, created a room to house the collection that was a near replica of Blade's original library."

        "content": "Ball was born into a musical family. Her grandmother and aunt both played piano music of their time and Ball started piano lessons when she started school, and showed an early interest in New Orleans style piano playing, as exemplified by Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, and James Booker. She has named Irma Thomas, the New Orleans vocalist, as her chief vocal inspiration. Ball studied English at Louisiana State University in the 1960s while playing in a band called Gum. In 1970, at age 21, she started a progressive country band called Freda and the Firedogs in Austin, Texas, and began her solo career in 1974. Ball's piano style includes elements of zydeco, swamp blues, Louisiana blues, and boogie woogie. She began her recording career as a solo artist with Rounder Records in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 2001, she joined the Chicago-based Alligator Records. Her Rounder album, Sing It!, which featured vocalists Irma Thomas and Tracy Nelson, released in January 1998 was nominated for a Grammy Award and a Blues Music Award for \"Best Contemporary Blues Album.\" Ball received the 1998 Blues Music Award for \"Contemporary Female Vocalist of the Year\" and \"Best Blues Instrumentalist-Keyboards.\" She was awarded \"Contemporary Blues Album of the Year\" for her albums Presumed Innocent (2002) and So Many Rivers (2004). The same year she also won \"Contemporary Blues Artist of the Year-Female.\" She won the \"Best Blues Instrumentalist-Keyboards\" again in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009. The BMA for Keyboards has since been renamed the Pinetop Perkins Piano Player Award and Ball has won it in 2012 and 2015. Her 2003 Alligator release, So Many Rivers, was nominated for a Grammy as were Live! Down The Road (2005) and Peace, Love & BBQ (2008). She was inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame in 2018.

In 2007, the two contributed another duet (\"I Can't Get New Orleans Off My Mind\") to Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino (Vanguard Records). She continues to play at nightclubs, particularly in Austin and New Orleans, and performs at music festivals in North America and overseas. In May 2015, Ball won the 'Pinetop Perkins Piano Player' award at the Blues Music Awards ceremony. She won the same award in 2019.

She told the BBC that she wished to raise awareness of the issue in Britain. Ash was hospitalised at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in April 2004 after suffering two cracked ribs. She was discharged after a few days, but was readmitted after losing all feeling in her legs. In June 2004 while she was still in hospital, it was announced that a Staphylococcus aureus infection might have rendered her permanently unable to walk. In January 2007 Ash confirmed she was suing the hospital. Papers lodged at the High Court asserted that Ash would never return to active TV roles. The hospital admitted breach of duty over part of her treatment but denied responsibility for the extent of her injuries and in January 2008 paid out a record \u00a35m compensation in an out-of-court settlement. Steve Walker, chief executive of the NHS Litigation Authority, said the payout set a new record for compensation following a hospital-acquired infection. The previous highest amount was \u00a3500,000. The payment was justified by the NHS compensation body as being \"because of the amount Leslie was earning at the time she fell ill and takes into account how much she might have earned in the future\"."

During this time Ash starred in a series of advertisements for the DIY chain Homebase (again, with Neil Morrissey) and starred in Merseybeat, which evoked further ridicule from the media about her appearance. Ash has since spoken out about the press ridicule she received as a result of her botched implants, commenting: \"If I'd lost a leg in a car crash, people wouldn't have felt able to take the mickey out of me so mercilessly\u00a0...

In the same year, he appeared in the film Dont Look Back which featured Bob Dylan on tour in the UK. During 1966, he enjoyed singles success with \"I Put a Spell on You\", which reached number 9 in the UK singles chart, and \"Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo\" which reached number 11 in the same chart. In 1967, the Randy Newman song \"Simon Smith and His Amazing Dancing Bear\" reached number four in the chart, as did his self-penned song, \"The House That Jack Built\". \"Don't Stop the Carnival\" followed in 1968, and rose to number 13 in the UK singles charts. Price went on to host shows such as the musical Price To Play in the late 1960s, which featured him performing and introducing the music of guests such as Fleetwood Mac and Jimi Hendrix. His second album, A Price on His Head (1967), featured seven songs by Randy Newman, who was virtually unknown at that time. In August 1967, he appeared with The Animals at the hippie love-in that was held in the grounds of Woburn Abbey. A later association with Georgie Fame resulted in \"Rosetta\", which became a top-20 hit (1971), reaching number 11 in the UK Singles Chart. An album followed, Fame and Price, Price and Fame Together. During this period, Price and Fame secured a regular slot on The Two Ronnies show produced by BBC Television, and also appeared on the Morecambe and Wise Show. He recorded the autobiographical album Between Today and Yesterday (1974) from which the single \"Jarrow Song\" was taken, returning Price to the UK singles chart at number six.  The minor single hits by Price \"Just For You\" and \"Baby of Mine\" from 1978 and 1979, respectively, as well as being issued on the usual black vinyl, were also released as red, heart-shaped vinyl discs, which reflected the craze for coloured and oddly shaped vinyl records at the time. Price participated in three reunions of The Animals between 1968 and 1984. In July 1983, they started their last world tour. Price's solo performance of \"Oh Lucky Man\" was included in their set. In 1984, they broke up for the final time, and the album Greatest Hits Live (Rip It to Shreds) was released, comprising recordings from their concert at Wembley Arena in London supporting The Police. Price recorded two albums with the Electric Blues Company featuring guitarist and vocalist Bobby Tench and keyboardist Zoot Money, the first, Covers, was recorded in 1994. A Gigster's Life for Me followed in 1996 and was recorded as part of Sanctuary's Blues Masters Series, at Olympic Studios in south-west London. Since 1996, Price has continued to perform regularly, arrange, write songs, and create other works. During the 2000s, he has continued to tour the UK with his own band and others, including the Manfreds, Maggie Bell and Bobby Tench. Savaloy Dip was officially released in 2016. Due to an issuing error after the recording of this album in 1974 the album was re-called by the record company and not re-released at that time. The title track for his album Between Today and Yesterday was taken from the original Savaloy Dip recording."

Pennebaker documentary Don't Look Back (1965) and is in several scenes with Bob Dylan and his entourage, including one where his departure from the Animals is mentioned. Price has been closely involved with the work of film director Lindsay Anderson. He wrote the music for Anderson's film O Lucky Man! (1973), which he performs on screen in the film and appears as himself in one part of the storyline. The score won the 1974 BAFTA Award for Best Film Music. Later, he wrote the score to Anderson's final film, The Whales of August (1987). He acted as the lead in Alfie Darling (1975), a sequel to the film Alfie (1966), during the course of which he became romantically involved with his co-star, Jill Townsend. He also composed and sang the theme tune to the film adaptation of The Plague Dogs (1982), \"Time and Tide\". In 1979, Price composed and sang the theme song to the ATV series Turtle's Progress. In 1981 he composed the score for the musical Andy Capp based on the eponymous comic strip. He also wrote the lyrics, together with the actor Trevor Peacock. The play transferred from the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, to London's Aldwych Theatre in September 1982. Price later provided the theme to Thames Television's 1988 sitcom adaptation of Andy Capp in the form of a rewritten \"Jarrow Song\". Other TV theme work includes a re-recorded version of his 1974 single \"Papers\", which was used as the theme tune to the London Weekend Television situation comedy Hot Metal and the song \"Changes\", soundtrack to a popular TV commercial for the VW Golf. In 1992, Anderson included an episode in his autobiographical BBC film Is That All There Is?, with a boat trip down the River Thames to scatter Rachel Roberts and Jill Bennett's ashes on the waters, while Price accompanied himself and sang the song \"Is That All There Is?\". In 2004, Price appeared in the Christmas edition of Heartbeat as  Frankie Rio, the leader of a  dubious band of musicians, the Franke Rio Trio, who are booked to appear in the Aidensfield Village Concert. The episode was entitled \"In the Bleak Midwinter\"."

In early 1945, his mother fled with him from the advancing Soviet troops during the evacuation of East Prussia in harsh winter conditions. Their train got stuck near Arnstadt, which was first occupied by the Americans, but then became part of the East German Soviet occupation zone. In 1949, they crossed the already-fortified border to resettle in Hanover, West Germany (as recounted in his song \"Renegade\" on the album Steppenwolf 7). Now living in the British occupation zone, the young Joachim, who suffered from eye problems, who could not speak or understand English, was first inspired by and learned about rock \u2018n\u2019 roll music while listening to Little Richard on U.S. Armed Forces radio.  He also saw a newsreel about the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, shot and smuggled out by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs (later of Easy Rider fame). When his family moved to Toronto in 1958, teachers had a hard time pronouncing his birth name, so he was called John K instead. Five years later, they moved to Buffalo, New York."

His mother Neel is Dutch and his father Herman (1935\u20132010) was a Surinamese footballer who arrived in the Netherlands along with the father of Ruud Gullit; the two sons grew up playing together in the city. Rijkaard was just 17 when Ajax coach Leo Beenhakker gave him his senior squad debut on 23 August 1980. He made an immediate impact, scoring the third goal in a 4\u20132 away victory over Go Ahead Eagles, the first league match in the 1980\u201381 season. He would play another 23 games for Ajax in his first season, netting four goals. In 1981\u201382, he won his first league championship with Ajax and went on to successfully defend the title the following season. Rijkaard stayed at Ajax for seven-and-a-half seasons. During this period, he won the Dutch league championship three times (1981\u201382, 1982\u201383, 1984\u201385) and the Dutch Cup three times (1982\u201383, 1985\u201386, 1986\u201387). In the 1986\u201387 season, he won the Cup Winners' Cup with Ajax over Lokomotiv Leipzig, winning 1\u20130. In September 1987, what would have been Rijkaard's third season (1987\u201388) under Dutchman Johan Cruyff as head coach, Rijkaard stormed off the training field and vowed never to play under him again. He was subsequently signed by Sporting CP, but he signed too late to be eligible to play in any competition. He was immediately loaned out to Real Zaragoza, but upon completing his first season at Zaragoza was signed by AC Milan."

From the resulting free kick, V\u00f6ller then handled the ball and then went to the ground (according to his own account) to avoid a collision with Dutch keeper Hans van Breukelen, while others, notably Rijkaard and van Breukelen, saw Voller's handball and his resulting action as a dive in hopes for a penalty. Van Breukelen was angry at this but Rijkaard, already annoyed by V\u00f6ller's previous antics, again confronted the West German by twisting his ear and stamping on his foot. Argentine referee Juan Carlos Loustau was tired of both V\u00f6ller and Rijkaard's consistently hostile antics towards each other in such a short period of time, and fearing a fight between the two, sent off both Rijkaard and V\u00f6ller. As he jogged back to the entrance tunnel, Rijkaard again spat in V\u00f6ller's hair as they left the pitch. The German press nicknamed him \"Llama\" for his spitting.

Due to his aggression and versatility, he was also capable of playing as a central or box-to-box midfielder, and even in a defensive role, usually in the centre. Although Rijkaard was known as strong tackler, he was surprisingly elegant for a player of his size, and also possessed good technique, passing ability, link-up play, and vision, which made him adept at starting attacking plays as a deep-lying playmaker once he won back possession; because of his technical skills and creative abilities, he was also capable of playing in more advanced roles, as an attacking midfielder or second striker. Due to his height and physical strength, he excelled in the air, and also possessed a powerful shot; furthermore, he was capable of getting forward and contributing to his team's attacking plays with goals by making late runs into the penalty area."

The season would prove to be a watershed for the club, but not without initial instability. Rijkaard arrived at the club as it entered a new phase, having elected a new president in Joan Laporta and a new managerial board, but with fans unhappy that Laporta had let English midfielder David Beckham snub the chance to join the club. For Rijkaard, the team he inherited, with the exception of new superstar signing Ronaldinho (who was the club's second choice after Beckham), also consisted of many underachieving players from the old guard and era that failed to meet the club and its fans' demands to match archrival Real Madrid's success in the early 2000s, having not won a trophy since 1999. Rijkaard had a disappointing start at Barcelona that saw some sections of the club's fans call for his resignation, and he drew flak from the media when the team lost to Real Madrid in December 2003. Rijkaard's resilience won through and from 2004 onwards, he achieved a massive turnaround, as the team went from strength to strength. Barcelona finished runners-up in La Liga in 2003\u201304, having been close to the relegation zone at one point in the earlier stages of the season. Rijkaard then took Barcelona to the next level as he phased out the old guard and rebuilt a new-look side around Ronaldinho, with new players like Deco, Samuel Eto'o, Rafael M\u00e1rquez and Ludovic Giuly, along with the latest promotion of some young players from the previous era trained in the club's youth teams, including V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s, Lionel Messi and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. He eventually succeeded in turning around the fortunes of the club, with the strong support of Laporta, and within the next couple of years finally managed to win La Liga both in 2004\u201305 and in 2005\u201306."

His no-nonsense policy on and off the field, and the sparkling football played by his team, won him many plaudits and Rijkaard was among the five nominated coaches for UEFA's Team of the Year 2005. On 8 March 2006, he was also honoured by UEFA for his contributions to the European Cup competition throughout his career as player and manager. Rijkaard also achieved success on the European stage, winning the 2005\u201306 Champions League with a 2\u20131 win against Arsenal in the final. Barcelona had been losing 1\u20130 for most of the match before his late tactical substitutions proved the decisive factor, as the introduction of Henrik Larsson and Juliano Belletti contributed directly to Barcelona's two goals. The win made him the fifth individual to have won the European Cup both as a player and as a manager, alongside Miguel Mu\u00f1oz, Giovanni Trapattoni, Johan Cruyff and Carlo Ancelotti, a feat later achieved also by his eventual successor, Pep Guardiola and then Zinedine Zidane. After losing to Manchester United in the semi-final of the 2007\u201308 Champions League, Rijkaard was asked whether he would quit at the end of the season, since he had not won anything for two successive seasons. He replied, \"I have no intention of leaving. It would be different if the players were saying it is time for me to go but that is not the case.\" On 1 May 2008, it was reported that Rijkaard allegedly confided to a colleague that he would be stepping down as Barcelona manager at the end of the season, but 24 hours later, he stated in a press conference that he had no intention of leaving the club. On 8 May 2008, the day after Barcelona's dismal 4\u20131 defeat to archrivals Real Madrid, Barcelona president Joan Laporta announced that at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, Rijkaard would no longer be head coach of the first team. Laporta made the announcement after a board meeting, and Rijkaard was succeeded by Pep Guardiola.

        "content": "As a coach, Rijkaard's essential philosophy is to guide his team towards playing attack-minded football as a cohesive unit. In doing this, he believes a team can achieve the dual objectives of winning games and ensuring the audience's enjoyment of the spectacle. This follows in the best coaching traditions of Rijkaard's countrymen and forebears Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff. In this light, it is notable that Michels coached both Cruyff and Rijkaard during their respective participations with the Dutch national team, and that Cruyff himself went on to coach Rijkaard. Nonetheless, Rijkaard believes in working within a contemporary football context and is not out to imitate the styles and tactics of past masters. In his own words: Rijkaard has evidently learned to curb the quick temper of his playing days and is often a portrait of calm and stability in training and along the touchline. He rarely courts controversy in the media and is more apt now to promote a positive environment and let his team's play speak for itself when faced with intense rivalry or criticism. The tactics used during his tenure as manager of Barcelona best exemplify Rijkaard's commitment to playing stylish attacking football. During the team's 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 campaigns, the coach frequently fielded a 4\u20133\u20133 formation, a system which encouraged the flair and creativity of the players in the front third of the field and created optimal interplay between the midfielders and forwards during attacks, with Ronaldinho being the focal point of the team's offence. Within this system, the four defenders also tended to play in a relatively high position on the pitch to support the midfield, which frequently advanced to participate in the attack. The team generally focuses on maintaining possession in the opponents' half of the field, applying pressure in order to force the opposition to make errors in defense and offensive counter-attacking."

        "content": "Jules \u00c9tienne Joseph Quicherat (13 October 1814 \u2013 8 April 1882) was a French historian and archaeologist. His father, a working cabinet-maker, came from Paray-le-Monial to Paris to support his large family; Quicherat was born there. He was fifteen years younger than his brother Louis, a great Latin scholar and lexicographer, who survived him. Although very poor, he was admitted to the College of Sainte-Barbe, where he received a thorough classical education. He showed his gratitude to this establishment by writing its history in three volumes, published between 1860 and 1864. At the end of his studies he hesitated for some time before deciding what career he would follow, until Jules Michelet put an end to his indecision by inspiring him with a taste for history. In 1835 Quicherat entered the \u00c9cole des Chartes; he left two years later at the head of the college. Once more inspired by the example of Michelet, who had just written an admirable work on Joan of Arc, he published the text of the two trials of Joan, adding much contemporary evidence on her heroism in his  (5 vols. 1841-1849), as well as half a volume of , in which it seems that the last word has been said on important points. From the 15th century he drew other inspirations. In 1844 he published memoirs of the adventures of a brigand, Rodrigue de Villandrando, which gradually grew into a volume full of fresh matter. He wrote full biographies of two chroniclers of Louis XI, one very obscure, Jean Castel, the other, Thomas Basin, bishop of Lisieux, who was, on the contrary, a remarkable politician, prelate and chronicler. Between 1855 and 1859 Quicherat published the works of the latter, most of which were now brought out for the first time. In addition to these he wrote Fragments in\u00e9dits de Georges Chastellain and Lettres, m\u00e9moires et autres documents relatifs \u00e0 la guerre du bien public en 1465. These works did not wholly occupy his time: in 1847 he inaugurated a course of archaeological lectures at the \u00c9cole des Chartes, and in 1849 was appointed professor of diplomatics at the same college. His teaching had exceptionally good results. Although he was not eloquent and had a nasal voice, his hearers were loath to miss any of his thoughtful teaching, which was unbiased and well expressed. Of his lectures the public saw only some articles on special subjects which were distributed in a number of reviews. Note should be made of a short treatise on  published in 1867; and a memoir  published in 1850, where he gives his theory on the use of stone arches important for the history of religious architecture. In an 1874 article on , he declared an exact date for the birth of Gothic architecture. Following the advice of his friends, he began to transcribe towards the end of his life his lectures on archaeology; but only the introductory chapters, up to the 11th century, were found among his papers. On the other hand, the pupils trained by him circulated his principles throughout France, recognizing him as the founder of national archaeology. In one point he seems to have taken a false step; with a warmth and pertinacity worthy of a better cause he maintained the identity of Caesar's Alesia with Alaise, and he died without becoming a convert to the opinion, now almost universally accepted, that Alise Sainte-Reine is the place where Vercingetorix capitulated. But even this error benefited science; some well directed excavations at Alaise brought many Roman remains to light, which were subsequently sent to enrich the museum at Besan\u00e7on. After 1871, his course of lectures on diplomatics having been given up, Quicherat, still professor of archaeology, was nominated director of the Ecole des Chartes. He filled this post with the same energy which he had shown in the many scientific commissions in which he had taken part. In 1878 he gave up his duties as professor, which then fell to the most conspicuous of his pupils, Robert de Lasteyrie. He died suddenly at Paris on April 8, 1882, a short time after having corrected the proofs of , published in the Revue Historique. After his death it was decided to bring out his hitherto unpublished papers; among these are some important fragments of his archaeological lectures, but his , with which he was occupied for many years, is missing."

Together with his wife, he was the first to describe the blue-tailed Buffon hummingbird subspecies (Chalybura buffonii intermedia Hartert, E & Hartert, C, 1894). The article On a collection of Humming Birds from Ecuador and Mexico appears to be their only joint publication. Hartert was employed by Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild as ornithological curator of Rothshild's private Natural History Museum at Tring, in England from 1892 to 1929. Hartert published the quarterly museum periodical Novitates Zoologicae (1894\u201339) with Rothschild, and the Hand-List of British Birds (1912) with Francis Charles Robert Jourdain, Norman Frederick Ticehurst and Harry Forbes Witherby.

        "content": "In 2003, Blalock had a breakthrough year, hitting 29 home runs and 90 RBIs with a .309 batting average. A combination of being able to hit for power and for average drew early comparisons to George Brett and helped him to get voted to the All-Star Game in his first full season as a Ranger, where he hit the game-winning home run off Los Angeles Dodgers closer \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 in the bottom of the 8th inning to give the American League a 7-6 victory. Blalock finished the 2004 season with 32 home runs and over 100 RBIs, and was voted to his second All-Star Game, when he participated in the Home Run Derby. A disappointing 2005 season made Blalock the center of many trade rumors. He was not traded, however, and he played 2006 with the Rangers. Hank had his own fan club called Hank's Homies during his time with the Rangers. They were a group of guys who wore cowboy hats, eyeblack, and Blalock jerseys to the games. The Rangers even installed hooks for the Homies to hang their sign to support Hank. On Mother's Day, May 14, 2006, Blalock was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. He hit his 100th career home run on June 23, 2006, in the sixth inning of a game against the Colorado Rockies. Blalock's decreasing performance since his breakout 2003 season led many to believe that he would be traded to make room for Mark DeRosa to take a full-time position in the Rangers' infield. However, the hiring of new manager Ron Washington, who was credited with improving the play of Oakland Athletics third baseman Eric Chavez, seemed to guarantee that Blalock would not be traded; and in fact, the Rangers declined to sign DeRosa, allowing him to file for free agency. Blalock was diagnosed with Thoracic outlet syndrome during the 2007 season and underwent surgery in May 2007 to remove his first rib. He returned to the lineup in September, but did not take the field at third base until 2008 in spring training. During the 2008 season, Blalock injured a hamstring, placing him on the disabled list again for the second time in two seasons. On May 18, 2008, Blalock and the Rangers announced that upon his return to the team, he would return as a first baseman. Blalock had never played first base as a professional, but he felt it was the best move for the team, as the Rangers had not seen much offensive production from their first basemen in 2008. Blalock worked with Ron Washington and spoke with Phil Nevin (who made a similar switch from third to first with San Diego in 2002) to start learning the position. With the emergence of Chris Davis at first base, Blalock temporarily returned to third, but eventually switched positions with Davis to avoid more shoulder problems. Blalock signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays for the 2010 season. His contract was purchased on May 15. He was designated for assignment on June 29, 2010 to make room for Gabe Kapler, and was released on July 8. Blalock retired after the 2010 season, and currently resides in San Diego."

        "content": "Elizabeth Ann Eckford (born October 4, 1941) is one of the Little Rock Nine, a group of African-American students who, in 1957, were the first black students ever to attend classes at the previously all-white Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas.  The integration came as a result of Brown v. Board of Education. Eckford's public ordeal was captured by press photographers on the morning of September 4, 1957, after she was prevented from entering the school by the Arkansas National Guard. A dramatic snapshot by Johnny Jenkins of the United Press (UP) showed the young girl being followed and threatened by an angry white mob; this and other photos of the day's startling events were circulated around the US and the world by the press. The best-known photograph of the event was taken by Will Counts of the Arkansas Democrat. His image was the unanimous selection for a 1958 Pulitzer Prize, but since the story had earned then-rival  Arkansas Gazette two other Pulitzer Prizes already, the Prize was awarded to another photographer for a pleasant photograph of a two-year-old boy in Washington, D.C. A different photo taken by Counts of Alex Wilson, a black reporter for the Memphis Tri-State Defender being beaten by the angry mob in Little Rock the same day, was chosen as the \"News Picture of the Year\" for 1957 by the National Press Photographers Association. This image by Counts prompted President Dwight D. Eisenhower to send federal troops to Little Rock. Eckford only spent one year at Little Rock Central High where she and the other black students were tormented throughout. In the years since, she has struggled through life, and twice attempted suicide. She was subsequently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder."

        "content": "On September 4, 1957, Eckford and eight other African American students (known as the Little Rock Nine) made an unsuccessful attempt to enter Little Rock Central High School, which had been segregated. An angry mob of about 400 surrounded the school that day, with the complicity of the Arkansas National Guard. Fifteen-year-old Eckford tried to enter the school, while soldiers of the National Guard, under orders from Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus, stepped in her way to prevent her from entering. Eventually, she gave up and tried to flee to a bus stop through the mob of segregationists who surrounded and threatened to lynch her. Once Eckford got to the bus stop, she couldn't stop crying. A reporter, Benjamin Fine, having in mind his own 15-year-old daughter, sat down next to Eckford. He tried to comfort her and told her, \"don't let them see you cry.\" Soon, she was also protected by a white woman named Grace Lorch who escorted her onto a city bus. The original plan was to have the nine children arrive together, but when the meeting place was changed the night before, the Eckford family's lack of a telephone left Elizabeth uninformed of the change. Instructions were given by Daisy Bates, a strong activist for desegregation, for the nine students to wait for her so that they could all walk together to the rear entrance of the school. This last-minute change caused Elizabeth to be the first to take a different route to school, walking up to the front entrance completely alone. Elizabeth Eckford's family was not informed of the meeting and didn't know that the school board asked the parents to accompany her. Also, Eckford rode a public bus alone to the segregated school. That day, Elizabeth wore a starched black-and-white dress, and she covered her face under black sunglasses. Elizabeth also held her school book in her hand. As she walked toward the school, Elizabeth was surrounded by a crowd of armed guards and a mob of people, and she did not see any black faces. The mob included men, women, and teenagers (white students) who opposed integration. The white teenagers chanted \"Two, four, six, eight, we ain't gonna integrate.\" Elizabeth attempted to go into the school through the mob but was denied entrance. Eckford walked to a bus bench at the end of the block. Eckford described her experience: Even though Elizabeth Eckford would one day be known as a member of the Little Rock Nine, at this point in the school day, she was all alone, making her the first African-American student to integrate a white southern high school. For the next two weeks, the Little Rock Nine stayed home to study instead of going to the Little Rock Central High School. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was reluctant to do anything about the mob or the rioting. Eisenhower summoned Orval Faubus, the Governor of Arkansas to intervene and asked for the withdrawal of all troops from the High School after Elizabeth Eckford's experience attempting to enter the school the first time. On September 23, 1957, the Little Rock Nine approached Central High again, and Elizabeth Eckford along with the other eight students, accompanied by city policemen, were let into the high school through a side door. The reaction from the mob was described as follows: The Arkansas National Guard, under orders from the governor, and an angry mob of about 400 surrounded the school and prevented them from going in. On September 23, 1957, a mob of about 1000 people surrounded the school again as the students attempted to enter. The following day, President Dwight D. Eisenhower took control of the Arkansas National Guard from the governor and sent the 101st Airborne Division to accompany the students to school for protection. Both federal troops and federalized National Guardsmen were deployed at the school for the entirety of the school year, although they were unable to prevent incidents of violence against the group inside, such as Eckford being thrown down a flight of stairs. All of the city's high schools were closed the following year, so Eckford did not graduate from Central High School. However, she had taken correspondence and night courses garnering enough credits for her high school diploma. In 1958, Eckford and the rest of the Little Rock Nine were awarded the Spingarn Medal by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), as was Ms. Bates."

        "content": "Eckford was accepted by Knox College in Illinois, but chose to return to Little Rock to be near her family. She later attended Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio, where she earned a BA in history. In 2018, Eckford was awarded an honorary doctorate from Knox College. Eckford served in the United States Army for five years, first as a pay clerk, and then as an information specialist. She also wrote for the Fort McClellan (Alabama) and the Fort Benjamin Harrison (Indiana) newspapers. After that, she has worked as a waitress, history teacher, welfare worker, unemployment and employment interviewer, and a military reporter. She is a probation officer in Little Rock. In 1997, she shared the Father Joseph Biltz Award\u2014presented by the National Conference for Community and Justice\u2014with Hazel Bryan Massery, a then-segregationist student at Central High School who appeared in several of the 1957 photographs screaming at the young Elizabeth. During the reconciliation rally of 1997, the two women made speeches together. But later their friendship broke up, with Eckford reflecting, \"[Hazel] wanted me to be cured and be over it and for this not to go on anymore. She wanted me to be less uncomfortable so that she wouldn't feel responsible.\" In 1999, President Bill Clinton presented the nation's highest civilian award, the Congressional Gold Medal, to the members of the Little Rock Nine. On the morning of January 1, 2003, one of Eckford's two sons, Erin Eckford, age 26, was shot and killed by police in Little Rock. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that the police officers had unsuccessfully tried to disarm him with a beanbag round after he had fired several shots from his rifle. When Eckford pointed his rifle towards them, the police officers shot him. His mother feared that his death was \"suicide by police\". Erin, she said, had suffered from mental illness but had been off his prescribed medication for several years. The newspaper later reported that prosecutors investigating the fatal shooting had decided that the police officers concerned were justified in shooting Eckford. In 2018, 60 years after leaving Little Rock Central High, Eckford told her story in her first autobiography, The Worst First Day: Bullied While Desegregating Little Rock Central High. The book was coauthored with Dr. Eurydice Stanley and Grace Stanley of Pensacola, Florida. Grace was 15 years old when she worked on the project, the same age Eckford was when she desegregated Central High. The Worst First Day tells Eckford's experiences in verse. It features the graphic artwork of Rachel Gibson and the photography of Will Counts. Eckford traveled to New Zealand in 2019 to teach American civil rights history to more than 4,000 students with Dr. Stanley at the request of high school teacher Roydon Agent, author of Public Image, Private Shame."

        "content": "Gregory was born around AD 213 to a wealthy pagan family in Neocaesarea (modern Niksar, then the capital of the area of Pontus in Asia Minor). Little is known of his pastoral work, and his surviving theological writings are in an incomplete state. This lack of knowledge partially obscures his personality, despite his historical importance, and his immemorial title Thaumaturgus, \"the wonder-worker\" in Latinized Greek, casts an air of legend about him. Nevertheless, the lives of few bishops of the third century are so well authenticated; the historical references to him permit a fairly detailed reconstruction of his work. Originally he was known as Theodore (\"gift of God\"), not an exclusively Christian name. He was introduced to the Christian religion at the age of fourteen, after the death of his father. He had a brother Athenodorus, and on the advice of one of their tutors, the young men were eager to study at the Berytus in Beirut, then one of the four or five famous schools in the Hellenic world. At this time, their brother-in-law was appointed assessor (legal counsel) to the Roman Governor of Palestine; the youths had therefore an occasion to act as an escort to their sister as far as Caesarea in Palestine. On arrival in that town they learned that the celebrated scholar Origen, head of the Catechetical School of Alexandria, resided there. Curiosity led them to hear and converse with the master. Soon both youths forgot all about Beirut and Roman law, and gave themselves up to the great Christian teacher, who gradually won them over to Christianity. In his panegyric on Origen, Gregory describes the method employed by that master to win the confidence and esteem of those he wished to convert; how he mingled a persuasive candour with outbursts of temper and theological argument put cleverly at once and unexpectedly. Persuasive skill rather than bare reasoning, and evident sincerity and an ardent conviction were the means Origen used to make converts. Gregory took up at first the study of philosophy; theology was afterwards added, but his mind remained always inclined to philosophical study, so much so indeed that in his youth he cherished strongly the hope of demonstrating that the Christian religion was the only true and good philosophy. For seven years he underwent the mental and moral discipline of Origen (231 to 238 or 239). There is no reason to believe that his studies were interrupted by the persecutions of Maximinus of Thrace; his alleged journey to Alexandria, at this time, may therefore be considered at least doubtful, and probably never occurred. Before leaving Palestine, Gregory delivered in presence of Origen a public farewell oration in which he returned thanks to the illustrious master he was leaving. This oration is valuable from many points of view. As a rhetorical exercise it exhibits the excellent training given by Origen, and his skill in developing literary taste and the amount of adulation then permissible towards a living person in an assembly composed mostly of Christians, and Christian in temper. It contains, moreover, much useful information concerning the youth of Gregory and his master's method of teaching. A letter of Origen refers to the departure of the two brothers, but it is not easy to determine whether it was written before or after the delivery of this oration. In it Origen exhorts his pupils to bring the intellectual treasures of the Greeks to the service of Christian philosophy, and thus imitate the Jews who employed the golden vessels of the Egyptians to adorn the Holy of Holies. Gregory returned to Pontus with the intention of practising law. His plan, however, was again laid aside, for he was soon consecrated bishop of his native Neocaesarea by Phoedimus, Bishop of Amasea and metropolitan of Pontus.  This fact illustrates in an interesting way the growth of the hierarchy in the primitive Church; the Christian community at Caesarea was very small, being only seventeen souls, and yet it was given a bishop. Ancient canonical documents indicate that it was possible for a community of even ten Christians to have their own bishop. When Gregory was consecrated he was forty years old, and he ruled his diocese for thirteen years. Nothing definite is known about his methods, but he must have shown much zeal in increasing the little flock with which he began his episcopal administration. An ancient source attests to his missionary zeal by recording a curious coincidence: Gregory began with only seventeen Christians, but at his death there remained only seventeen pagans in the whole town of Caesarea. Presumably the many miracles which won for him the title of Thaumaturgus were performed during these years."

Drawing on family traditions and a knowledge of the neighbourhood, the account by Gregory of Nyssa is more reliably historical than other known versions of the Thaumaturge's life. By the time of Rufinus (ca. 400), the original story was becoming confused; the Syriac account is at times obscure and contradictory. Even the life by Gregory of Nyssa exhibits a legendary element, though the facts were supplied to the writer by his grandmother, St. Macrina the Elder. He relates that before his episcopal consecration Gregory retired from Neocaesarea into a solitude, and was favoured by an apparition of the Blessed Virgin and John the Apostle, and that the latter dictated to him a creed or formula of Christian faith, of which the autograph existed at Neocaesarea when the biography was being written. The creed itself is important for the history of Christian doctrine. Gregory of Nyssa describes at length the miracles that gained for the Bishop of Caesarea the title of Thaumaturgus. It is clear that Gregory's influence must have been considerable, and his miraculous power undoubted. It might have been expected that Gregory's name would appear among those who took part in the First Council of Antioch against Paul of Samosata; probably he took part also in the second council held there against the same heresiarch, for the letter of that council is signed by a bishop named Theodore, which had been originally Gregory's name. To attract the people to the festivals in honour of the martyrs, Gregory organized profane amusements that might appeal to pagans, who were accustomed to religious ceremonies that combined solemnity with pleasure and merrymaking."

        "content": "The Oratio Panegyrica in honour of Origen describes in detail that master's pedagogical methods. Its literary value consists less in its style than in its novelty: it is the first attempt at autobiography in Christian literature. This youthful work is full of enthusiasm and genuine talent; moreover, it proves how fully Origen had won the admiration of his pupils, and how the training Gregory received influenced the remainder of a long and well spent life. Gregory tells us in this work (xiii) that under Origen he read the works of many philosophers, without restriction as to school, except that of the atheists. From this reading of the old philosophers he learned to insist frequently on the unity of God; and his long experience of pagan or crudely Christian populations taught him how necessary this was. Traces of this insistence are to be met with in the Tractatus ad Theopompum, concerning the passability and impassibility of God; this work seems to belong to Gregory, though in its general arrangement it reminds us of Methodius. A similar trait was probably characteristic of the lost Dialogus cum Aeliano (Pros Ailianon Dialexis), which we learn of through St. Basil, who frequently attests the orthodoxy of the Thaumaturgus (Ep. xxviii, 1, 2; cciv, 2; ccvii, 4) and even defends him against the Sabellians, who claimed him for their teaching and quoted as his formula:  (that the Father and the Son were two in intelligence, but one in substance) from the aforesaid Dialogus cum Aeliano. St. Basil replied that Gregory was arguing against a pagan, and used the words , i.e. in the heat of combat, not in calm exposition; in this case he was insisting, and rightly, on the Divine unity. He added, moreover, that a like explanation must be given to the words  (created, made) when applied to the Son, reference being to Christ Incarnate. Basil added that the text of the work was corrupt."

It makes clear Gregory's orthodoxy a propos of the Trinity. Its authenticity and date seem now definitely settled, the date lying between 260 and 270. Caspari has shown that this confession of faith is a development of the premises laid down by Origen. Its conclusion leaves no room for doubt: \"There is therefore nothing created, nothing greater or less (literally, nothing subject) in the Trinity (oute oun ktiston ti, he doulon en te triadi), nothing superadded, as though it had not existed before, but never been without the Son, nor the Son without the Spirit; and this same Trinity is immutable and unalterable forever\". Such a formula, stating clearly the distinction between the Persons in the Trinity, and emphasizing the eternity, equality, immortality, and perfection, not only of the Father, but of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, proclaims a marked advance on the theories of Origen."

The brief Treatise on the Soul addressed to one Tatian, in favour of which may be cited the testimony of Nicholas of Methone (probably from Procopius of Gaza), is now claimed for Gregory. The  or Twelve Chapters on Faith do not seem to be the work of Gregory. According to Caspari, the Kata meros pistis or brief exposition of doctrine concerning the Trinity and the Incarnation, attributed to Gregory, was composed by Apollinaris of Laodicea about 380,and circulated by his followers as a work of Gregory (Otto Bardenhewer). Finally, the Greek, Syriac, and Armenian Caten\u00e6 contain fragments attributed more or less correctly to Gregory. The fragments of the De Resurrectione belong rather to Pamphilus' Apologia for Origen."

        "content": "Nicholas Rackard (28 April 1922 \u2013 10 April 1976) was an Irish hurler whose league and championship career with the Wexford senior team spanned seventeen years from 1940 to 1957. He established many championship scoring records, including being the top championship goal-scorer of all time with 59 goals. Rackard is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game. Born in Killane, County Wexford, Rackard was introduced to sport by his father who had hoped he would become a cricketer. His uncle, John Doran, won an All-Ireland medal as a Gaelic footballer with Wexford in 1918 and it was hurling and Gaelic football that Rackard developed a talent for. Rackard played competitive hurling as a boarder at St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny. Here he won back-to-back Leinster medals in 1938 and 1939, however, an All-Ireland medal remained elusive. By this stage Rackard had started playing for the local Rathnure St. Anne's club, winning a county junior championship medal in 1940. As a member of the club's senior team he won four county senior championship medals. Rackard made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was selected for the Wexford minor panel. He was just out of the minor grade when he was selected for the Wexford senior team in 1940. Over the course of the next seventeen years, Rackard won two All-Ireland medals as part of the Wexford hurling breakthrough in 1955 and 1956. He also won four Leinster medals, one National Hurling League medal and one Leinster medal as a Gaelic footballer. He played his last game for Wexford in August 1957. By the late 1940s, Rackard was a regular in the full-forward line on the Leinster inter-provincial team. Success came in the twilight of his career and he claimed his sole Railway Cup medal in 1956. Rackard's brothers, Billy and Bobby, also enjoyed All-Ireland success with Wexford. In retirement from playing Rackard became involved in team management and coaching. It was with the Wexford senior team that he enjoyed his greatest successes as a selector when, in 1968, he helped the team secure the All-Ireland title. Rackard was most famous for his scoring prowess and was the all-time top championship scorer at the time of his retirement from hurling. His private life was marred by periods of excessive drinking, which had started during his university studies, and eventually developed into alcoholism. After quitting drinking completely in 1970, Rackard travelled the country as a counsellor with Alcoholics Anonymous. In an interview in the Irish Press in 1975, he detailed his life as a recovering alcoholic and became one of the first sportspeople to break the taboo of alcoholism in Ireland. Rackard's death from cancer in April 1976 saw a huge outpouring of grief amongst the hurling community. He was posthumously honoured by being named on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984, however, he was sensationally omitted from the Hurling Team of the Millennium in favour of Ray Cummins."

His parents were Robert (Bob) Rackard and Anastasia Doran, who had been married in 1918. He was born into a family that was mildly interested in sport. His granduncle had played with the famous Wexford football team that captured four All-Ireland titles in-a-row between 1915 and 1918. Rackard's father Bob had planned that his son would play cricket, however, young Rackard was much more interested in Gaelic games. He was educated locally and later attended St. Kierans College, Kilkenny, a virtual academy for young hurling talent. Rackard later attended University College Dublin where he studied to be a veterinary surgeon. In all, his studies took eight years to complete because of his huge commitment to his sporting exploits."

        "content": "Rackard's early successes on the inter-county scene were as a footballer with the Wexford team. At the time the county's hurling team was in the doldrums, however, things were about to change. Rackard made his debut for the county team in 1940 and spent much of the decade at midfield. By the start of the 1950s he had moved into the forward lines and it was here that he captured his first Leinster title in 1951. Wexford later faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final, a team that was attempting to capture a third championship title in-a-row. The game itself saw Rackard give a remarkable display of hurling artistry; however, Tipp's forward line ran riot and scored seven goals. The final score of 7\u20137 to 3\u20139 tells its own story. Wexford lost their Leinster crown in 1952, however, two years later in 1954 Wexford regained the title following a huge victory over Dublin. That game saw Rackard score a grand total of five goals and five points from Wexford's tally of 8\u20135. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final saw Wexford face Antrim. Once again, Rackard ran riot in the forward line and amassed a personal tally of seven goals and seven points. A 12\u201317 to 2\u20133 victory gave Wexford an easy passage to the championship decider where they faced Cork. On this occasion 'the Rebels' were attempting to capture a third All-Ireland title on the trot and a record crowd turned out in Croke Park to see Rackard and Christy Ring do battle. In the end it was Johnny Clifford who turned out to be the hero as Cork won the day on a score line of 1\u20139 to 1\u20136. In 1955 Rackard won his third Leinster title, however, an All-Ireland medal still eluded his collection. Wexford later defeated Limerick in the All-Ireland semi-final before later facing Galway in the championship decider. At half-time the men from the West led by 2\u20135 to 2\u20133, however a Tim Flood goal nine minutes from full-time gave Wexford a deserved 3\u201313 to 2\u20138 win. It was the county's first championship title since 1910 and it was Rackard's first All-Ireland medal. In 1956 Wexford captured their first National Hurling League title and breezed through the provincial championship once again with Rackard collecting his fourth Leinster title. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Wexford aiming to retain their title and gain revenge over Cork for the defeat in 1954. The game has gone down in history as one of the all-time classics as Christy Ring was bidding for a ninth All-Ireland medal. The game turned on one important incident as the Wexford goalkeeper, Art Foley, made a miraculous save from a Ring shot and cleared the sliothar up the field to set up another attack. Rackard scored a crucial goal with two minutes to go giving Wexford a 2\u201314 to 2\u20138 victory. In spite of Cork's loss Wexford's Nick O'Donnell and Bobby Rackard, in an unparalleled display of sportsmanship in any game, raised Christy Ring onto their shoulders and carried him off the field. Wexford had won the game but there was no doubt in their minds that the real hero was Ring. After defeat in the Leinster final of 1957 Nicky Rackard decided to retire from inter-county hurling."

His problems with alcohol began while he was studying to be a veterinary surgeon in Dublin. In 1951 he suddenly gave up alcohol in a pledge not to drink again after a friend, who was a priest, died. When Wexford celebrated All-Ireland success in 1955 and 1956 Rackard was a teetotaller. During a visit to New York in 1957, however, Rackard began drinking again and the habit grew progressively worse over the next 12 years. In 1965, then a serious alcoholic, he had his first period of hospitalisation to treat the illness. At that stage he was drinking daily, however, the treatment didn't work. He finally quit by 1970 after joining Alcoholics Anonymous. When Rackard quit drink for the final time he was practically broke. He pieced his life together again, rebuilt his veterinary practice and indulged his passion for horses, enjoying wins in point-to-points and other major race events. With the AA he travelled the country helping people who were troubled by alcohol. In February 1974 Rackard noticed strange lumps on his neck which he had later removed. Later that year he was told he needed another operation and was said to be making good progress. In 1975 he spoke out in the Irish Press newspaper about his alcoholism, becoming one of the first people to break the taboo of alcoholism in Ireland. Shortly after this it was revealed that the cancer that had previously troubled him had unfortunately not been completely annihilated and had returned. Rackard died at St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin in 1976 and was universally mourned by the GAA community throughout Ireland."

In 2006, a Wexford author, Tom Williams, wrote a long-overdue biography of Rackard entitled Cuchulainn's Son \u2013 The Story of Nickey Rackard. The same author also penned a now well-known song about Rackard many years earlier. It too was called Cuchulainn's Son and has been recorded by various artists over the last 20 years and is a lament for the great sportsman. In Wexford town, there is a statue to commemorate Rackard, erected in 2012."

Born in London and qualifying as a solicitor, Dupont served during the Second World War as an officer of the British Royal Artillery in North Africa before first visiting Southern Rhodesia in 1947. He returned a year later, started a ranch and emigrated full-time during the early 1950s, by which time the country had become a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. When Rhodesia's government under Ian Smith issued the Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain on 11 November 1965, Dupont, as Deputy Prime Minister, was the second to sign. Smith attempted to have Dupont named as Governor-General in place of the British-appointed Governor, Humphrey Gibbs, but failing this instead made him Officer Administering the Government.  He held this post until 1970, when he became President following the declaration of a republic. After suffering from ill health during this last appointment, he retired at 1976 and died in 1978."

However, Dupont was not pleased with the performance of the Prime Minister, Winston Field, and after Field's failure to win independence from the United Kingdom in 1963 following the dissolution of the Central African Federation, he and Desmond Lardner-Burke, known as \"the cowboys\", joined forces to overthrow Field and install Ian Smith as Prime Minister. In October 1964, Dupont thwarted Sir Roy Welensky's attempt to re-enter politics in Rhodesia following the break-up of the Federation. Welensky had assumed the leadership of the opposition UFP (which he renamed the Rhodesia Party), and was contesting a by-election in Arundel, but Dupont deliberately resigned his constituency in Charter to oppose him. Dupont soundly defeated Welensky by 1079 votes to 633. Forming a close relationship with the rising RF politician Ian Smith, Dupont assisted in the latter's becoming Prime Minister in 1964 and was consequently promoted to become Smith's deputy. As Deputy Prime Minister, he held the portfolio of External Affairs, and added Defence in June 1965."

When Smith issued the Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965, Dupont was the second signatory to the UDI document. Smith's government initially continued to profess loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II. Accordingly, it continued to recognise Elizabeth as head of state, with oaths of allegiance to \"Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth, Queen of Rhodesia, her heirs and successors\". At the same time, Smith's government ceased to recognise the authority of her de jure representative, the Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs. When Gibbs formally dismissed Smith and his entire cabinet on orders from Whitehall, Smith maintained that Gibbs' reserve power to sack the government no longer existed. Instead, on 17 November, it appointed Dupont to the post of \"Acting Officer Administering the Government\". Opponents of UDI who considered it an illegal move, such as the Independent member of the Legislative Assembly Ahrn Palley, refused to recognise Dupont's office, and walked out of the opening of Parliament when Dupont came to deliver the Speech from the Throne. On 2 December 1965, Smith wrote a personal letter to the Queen asking her to accept Dupont as Governor-General of Rhodesia. In response, the Queen replied, \"Her Majesty is not able to entertain purported advice of this kind, and has therefore been pleased to direct that no action shall be taken upon it\". Smith was attempting to assert his claimed prerogatives as Her Majesty's Rhodesian Prime Minister. However, the UK, with the near-unanimous support of the international community, maintained that Gibbs was the Queen's only legitimate representative in what it still considered to be the colony of Southern Rhodesia, and hence the only lawful authority in the area. Under the 1965 Constitution, if the Queen did not appoint a Governor-General within fourteen days of advice being tendered by the Prime Minister, a Regent was to be appointed. In deference to the Royal Family, however, on 16 December, Smith amended his original plan and Dupont was appointed as Officer Administering the Government. He would continue to use the title until the declaration of a republic in 1970. In a referendum held on 24 June 1969, the predominantly white electorate approved a new constitution making Rhodesia a republic, with the President as ceremonial head of state. A Bill to that effect was passed by the Legislative Assembly on 17 November, and was signed into law by Dupont on 27 November. Dupont's last duty as Officer Administrating the Government was to sign the proclamation of a republic on 2 March 1970."

His work M\u00e4rchenmond was translated into a theatre play, which has been presented in places like the Westf\u00e4lisches Landestheater or the Theater f\u00fcr Niedersachsen. The German progressive metal band, Vanden Plas, recorded and consecutively released two full-length albums, Chronicles of the Immortals \u2013 Netherworld (Path One) in 2014 and Chronicles of the Immortals \u2013 Netherworld II in 2015, that were adapted from Blutnacht, a theater production based on the author's Die Chronik der Unsterblichen.Throughout the years, various propositions have been made to turn some of his works into film, for example for Das Druidentor or Azrael, but none of these projects were realized. In September 2016 however, Constantin Film announced they will create a feature film based on his book Hagen von Tronje''. In 2020 Sony produced a film called Die Wolfgang or The Magic Kids (Three Unlikely Heros) about Vlad the vampire who moves to a new magical town and a special magical school, three of the year 7 children team up together as they all have their own problems - a fairy who is afraid of heights, a werewolf who is allergic to fur, and a vampire who can't stand blood.  They soon discover that the town is controlled by a demon who is after one thing - a magical crystal that has been left by Vlad's mother that could bring back dark magical times if used improperly."

He was re-elected in the 1979, 1980. Parent was defeated in the 1984 election as Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party swept to power, but regained his seat four years later in 1988, and was re-elected in the 1993 and 1997 elections. His riding's name was subsequently changed to Welland, then Welland\u2014St. Catharines\u2014Thorold and finally Niagara Centre. Under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Parent served, at different times between 1977 and 1981, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs, to the Minister of Labour and to the Minister of State (Sports). Parent was first elected Speaker in January 1994. In the House, Parent was forced into the challenge of presiding over a five-party Parliament that resulted from the emergence of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and the Reform Party. Upon being re-elected to the position in September 1997, he told the Montreal Gazette that he expected the different voices in Parliament, informed by strong opinions on all sides, would make the House the lively place it should be. Parent died at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto at the age of 73 of pneumonia while recovering from colon cancer surgery. He is survived by his brothers, Gerald Parent and Romeo Parent, wife of 39 years, Joan Parent (n\u00e9e Davis), their 4 daughters, Michele (Dave) Hundertmark, Monique (John) Finley, Madeleine (Mark) Thomas, and Terri (Sandro) Perruzza and 13 grandchildren, and partner Sandra Page, 2 daughters and 1 grandchild."

        "content": "As a youth, Burke played in the 1980 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the St. Michael's minor ice hockey team from Toronto. Burke was drafted by the New Jersey Devils in the second round of the 1985 NHL Entry Draft. He earned national attention from his international play, backstopping the Canada men's national junior ice hockey team to a silver medal in the 1986 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships and a fourth-place finish for the men's national team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Burke transitioned directly from Canada's Olympics national team to the Devils. He started 11 games for the Devils in the 1987\u201388 season, including an overtime victory against the Chicago Blackhawks on the final night of the season that qualified the Devils for their first Stanley Cup playoff series. Dubbed a \"rookie sensation\", Burke helped the Devils go on a strong playoff run, defeating the division-leader New York Islanders in the first round in six games and then the Washington Capitals in seven games. The Devils were one game away from the Stanley Cup Finals but lost in Game 7 of the Wales Conference Finals to the Boston Bruins. Burke's play was widely heralded, with The Hockey Digest stating, \"Burke is now the franchise for the Devils, and to whatever heights he rises, the Devils will rise with him,\" and in December 1988, Burke became the first Devil to appear on its cover. Because he played just 11 games in the 1987\u201388 regular season, Burke maintained his rookie status for the 1988\u201389 season. That season, he was named to the 1989 All-Star Game. Burke played for the Devils through the 1990\u201391 season, then sat out the 1991\u201392 season due to unhappiness. Instead, he played for the Canadian national team and played in the Winter Olympics for a second time, backstopping Canada to a silver medal. On August 28, 1992, Burke was traded to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for Bobby Hol\u00edk, a second-round pick in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft (used to select Jay Pandolfo) and future considerations. He played there (and with the relocated Whalers team, the Carolina Hurricanes) for six seasons. He was voted Whalers' team MVP from 1993 to 1997. Burke then played with several teams, including the Philadelphia Flyers, Vancouver Canucks and Florida Panthers. He subsequently signed with the Phoenix Coyotes and played there for five seasons, where he was a finalist for the Vezina Trophy and third finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy in the 2001\u201302 season. After that, Burke played for the Philadelphia Flyers (for the second time) recording his 300th career NHL win (the 20th goaltender to reach this milestone), and the Tampa Bay Lightning. Burke was placed on waivers by Tampa Bay before the 2006\u201307 season but was not picked up. He then played for Tampa Bay's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. However, he struggled with the Falcons and lost his starting job to Karri R\u00e4m\u00f6. He was then placed on waivers by the Lightning and picked up off re-entry waivers by the Los Angeles Kings. Burke announced his retirement from professional hockey on September 18, 2007."

When the Civil War broke out Vest was a strong advocate of maintaining slavery during the Missouri secession crisis, and eventually sided with the Confederacy. He proposed the Secession Ordinance that was passed by the Missouri legislature in October 1861. The following year, he briefly served as judge advocate with the Army of Missouri, commanded by former Governor Sterling Price.

It was at this time in 1869 that Vest was asked to represent Charles Burden and Old Drum in the case that would make him famous, Burden v. Hornsby. Vest took the case tried on September 23, 1870, in which he represented a client whose hunting dog, a foxhound named Drum (or Old Drum), had been killed by a sheep farmer, Leonidas Hornsby. The farmer (Burden's brother-in-law) had previously announced his intentions to kill any dog found on his property; the dog's owner was suing for damages in the amount of $150 (), the maximum allowed by law. During the trial, Vest stated that he would \"win the case or apologize to every dog in Missouri.\" Vest's closing argument to the jury made no reference to any of the testimony offered during the trial, and instead offered a eulogy of sorts. Vest's \"Eulogy of the Dog\" is one of the most enduring passages of purple prose in American courtroom history (only a partial transcript has survived): Vest won the case (the jury awarded $50 to the dog's owner) and also won its appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court. A bust of the dog resides in the Missouri Supreme Court building in Jefferson City, Missouri. In 1958, a statue of the dog was erected on the Johnson County Courthouse lawn containing a summation of Vest\u2019s closing speech, \u201cA man\u2019s best friend is his dog.\u201d"

The Nizam himself went to the Majlis where the poet was to recite.  While returning from Hyderabad, he sojourned at Allahabad in 1871 and recited his marsia in the Imambara of late Lala Beni Prasad Srivastava, Vakil, who was a devotee of Imam Husain.

He composed as easily and casually as he spoke.\". In his essay \"How to read Iqbal?\" Shamsur Rahman Faruqi wrote: \"Iqbal was placed better because he had, among others, Bedil (1644\u20131720) in Persian and Mir Anis (1802\u20131874) in Urdu.\" He further asserts: \"The mention of Mir Anis may surprise some of us until we realize it that Mir Anis\u2019s Marsiyas are the best premodern model in Urdu of narrative-historical, narrative-lyrical, and oral-dramatic poetry, and Iqbal\u2019s poetry extends and exploits the possibilities created by Anis.\" Mir Anis was criticized for playing on religious sentiments giving his work a vertical appeal at the expense of poetic beauty. While Farhat Nadir Rizvi, in her research, has propounded that Anis was narrating recorded history and was therefore restricted in use of pure imagination and fantasy, yet he dexterously harnessed the art of storytelling in his work and we cannot but accept that he was not only a Marsiya writer but also a successful storyteller. Anis has been compared with Shakespeare. Shakespeare creates imaginary plots and characters so beautifully that they appear real to the reader; Anis narrates events and characters fossilized in history so vividly that they become alive in the eyes of his audience. Anis is also known as a pioneer in Rubai, an Urdu poetry branch, and enjoys status akin to that of Mirza Sauda, Khwaja Mir Dard and Dabeer. Besides being a master of the Marsia, Anis was also a specialist of the Rubai, the shortest complete poem in Urdu, containing only four lines. He enriched the contents of the Rubai, making it much more colorful and multi-dimensional. Anis introduced the tragic events of Karbala and their moralistic effect to Rubai. Thus, he widened the scope of Rubai to unfathomable limits. The inclusion of Karbala resulted in the florescence of the Urdu Rubai. Thus, many internal and external aspects of our life found their echo in the Urdu Rubai."

He began serving as the head coach of the Ukrainian national team in September 2003. Under his leadership, Ukraine qualified for a major tournament for the first time as an independent nation, reaching the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. Ukraine reached the quarter-finals of the tournament, losing to eventual champions Italy. Following the side's failure to reach UEFA Euro 2008, Blokhin stepped down as coach on 6 December 2007. On 14 December 2007, he was named head coach of FC Moscow. The club finished 9th (from 16) and after the season ended Blokhin was fired from the club. At the end of the season, Blokhin announced that if he knew how things would go in FC Moscow, he would have never signed there. This was because the club released many important players without Blokhin's permission yet still had many high expectations. Others said that the reason Blokhin failed in FC Moscow was that he and the press didn't have a friendly relationship, and because of that the press was constantly attacking Blokhin and that damaged his status among the players. On 21 April 2011 Blokhin was again appointed head coach of the Ukrainian national team. He led the team in UEFA Euro 2012 on home soil, beating Sweden but exiting at the group stage after defeats to France and England. On 25 September 2012, Dynamo Kyiv signed Blokhin to lead the club for the next four years. His final matches in charge of Ukraine were World Cup qualifiers against Moldova and Montenegro in October 2012. Blokhin was dismissed as Dynamo's manager by the club's President Ihor Surkis on 17 April 2014 because of the \"unsatisfactory results of the team\". The day before, in a press conference after Dynamo had lost a match against Shakhtar Donetsk, Blokhin had already stated that he had decided to resign. Under his leadership Dynamo never qualified (a rare occasion for the club) for the UEFA Champions League and performed poorly in the UEFA Europa League. In his first year his team finished third in the Ukrainian Premier League and in his second year (when he was fired) Dynamo was seven points behind Ukrainian Premier League leaders Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk and Shakhtar Donetsk."

This was to show appreciation to teachers who were working in poverty stricken areas and had no access to electricity, telephones, potable water and other basic amenities. Many teachers refuse to be posted to these areas due to the impoverished conditions of living. The awards are in the forms of money, laptops, refrigerators and scholarships up to PhD level studies. In October 2017, Global Communities partnered with the Foundation to start up the Youth Inclusive Entrepreneurial Development Initiative for Employment (YIEDIE) project. The initiative was for five years and aimed at creating opportunities in the construction industry, to benefit economically disadvantaged youth. Global Communities, a non-profit organization with a global reach, works with communities to create sustainable changes that improve the lives and livelihoods of the less privileged. The implementation of this project was in conjunction with the Mastercard Foundation. The project operates in Ghana's five largest cities: Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Ashaiman, and Tema and will provide opportunities for at least 23,700 youth, between ages 17-24, who earn less than $2 per day. In November 2017, 4,946 children from eight districts in the Ashanti, Ahafo, Bono and Bono East Regions (Sekyere North, Bekwai Municipality, Atwima Mponua, Bibaini-Anwhiaso-Bekwai, Bosomtwe, Offinso Municipality, New Edubaise and Goaso district) were given free computer training. This was done by a collaboration between Otumfuo-Agroecom Mobile Library Project (OAMLP), which is a subsidiary of the Otumfuo Charity Foundation, and Agroecom Ghana Ltd, a cocoa buying company. This initiative is in line with its aim to bridge the gap in learning conditions between the urban and less privileged communities and instill reading and the use of ICT in pupils at the basic level. In January 2019, an agreement was entered into by the Foundation and Young Educators Foundation who are the organizers of the ''Spelling Bee\" competition. This was geared towards making the literary programs of the Young Educators Foundation available to less privileged communities and public schools in the Ashanti Region. This would give 100 students the opportunity to benefit from the program every year. In May 2020, junior high school students in Kumasi received over 2000 books and dictionaries. Some of the communities that benefited from this gesture were Bohyen, Aduato, Adumanu, Ampabame and South Suntreso. This was aimed at keeping students academically active while schools were closed to control the spread of COVID-19. In June 2020, the Foundation donated books to about 750 Junior High School students from 11 basic schools in the Ahafo Region of Ghana. This was to facilitate the excellent performance of the students, especially in the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE). In July 2020, AngloGold Ashanti teamed up with the Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Charity Foundation and the Obuasi Municipal and East Educational Directorates to roll out a Live Radio and Distance Learning Programme in Obuasi. This was to ensure continuation in learning, even though schools had been closed down to control COVID-19. The Foundation was supported by the mine with an amount of 150,000 Ghana Cedis (GH\u20b5) for the purchase and distribution of 10,000 copies of Readers and Workbooks to Junior High School Students in the catchment area. In March 2021, the name of the foundation was changed to Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Foundation(OOTIIF). This come about as a result of the Otumfuo Education Fund, the Serwaa Ampem Foundation for Children and the Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Charity Foundation being merged into one charity with a new Board of Trustees and Management. The new board was constituted of Nana Prof. Oheneba Boachie-Adjei Woahene II as the chair and Sir Samuel Esson Jonah, Dr. Kwaku Mensa-Bonsu, Mrs. Margaret Boateng Sekyere,Dr. Kwame Bawuah-Edusei, Rev. Akua Ofori-Boateng, Mr. Andrew Asamoah, Nana Akuoku Boateng and Mrs. Mariam Agyeman Gyasi Jawhary."

He was born in Winburg and died in Cape Town, a descendant of the Loyalist Johannes Frederik Janse Van Rensburg. He received his MA in German from the University of Stellenbosch, and his bachelor's and doctorates in law from University of Pretoria. Van Rensburg qualified as a solicitor and was hired as the personal secretary of Tielman Roos, the Minister of Justice. In 1933, he became Secretary of Justice (under Smuts as Minister). As Secretary, he traveled overseas. In Germany, he met Adolf Hitler, Hermann G\u00f6ring, and other top Nazi officials. He was greatly impressed by Hitler's leadership and the discipline he observed in Germany. In 1938, he helped organize the Ossewabrandwag as a vehicle for Afrikaner nationalism though often at odds with the National Party, the main driver of Afrikaner Nationalism. Van Rensburg was the commander general of the Ossewabrandwag from 1941 until 1952. Like most members of the Ossewabrandwag, he was regarded as a German sympathizer during the Second World War. Van Rensburg died on 25 September 1966 in Cape Town, and was buried with military honors."

After the Great Famine in Ireland, he began writing patriotic poems, such as A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century. Mangan was troubled, eccentric, and an alcoholic.

Meath. After marrying Smith, James Mangan took over a grocery business in Dublin owned by the Smith family, eventually becoming bankrupt as a result. Mangan described his father as having \"a princely soul but no prudence\", and attributed his family's bankruptcy to his father's suspect business speculations and tendency to throw expensive parties. Thanks to poor record keeping, inconsistent biographies, and his own semi-fictional and sensationalized autobiographical accounts, Mangan's early years are the subject of much speculation. However, despite the popular image of Mangan as a long-suffering, poor poet, there is reason to believe that his early years were spent in middle class comfort. He was educated at a Jesuit school where he learned Latin, Spanish, French, and Italian. He attended three schools before the age of fifteen. Obliged to find a job in order to support his family, for seven years he was a scrivener's clerk and for three years earned meagre wages in an attorney's office, and was later an employee of the Ordnance Survey and an assistant in the library of Trinity College, Dublin."

        "content": "Mangan's first verses were published in 1818. From 1820 he adopted the middle name Clarence. In 1830 he began producing translations \u2013 generally free interpretations rather than strict transliterations \u2013 from German, a language he had taught himself. Of interest are his translations of Goethe. From 1834 his contributions began appearing in the Dublin University Magazine. In 1840 he began producing translations from Turkish, Persian, Arabic, and Irish. He was also known for literary hoaxes; some of his \"translations\" are in fact works of his own, like Twenty Golden Years Ago, attributed to a certain Selber. His connection with The Dublin University Magazine was terminated because his habits rendered him incapable of regular application. He was friends with the patriotic journalists Thomas Davis, and John Mitchel, who would write his biography. His poems were published in their newspaper The Nation. Mangan was for a time paid a fixed salary, but, as on former occasions, these relations were broken off, though he continued to send verses to \"The Nation\" even after he had cast in his lot with Mitchel, who in 1848 began began to issue The United Irishman. Although his early poetry was often apolitical, after the Famine he began writing patriotic poems, including influential works such as Dark Rosaleen, a translation of R\u00f3is\u00edn Dubh and A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century. His best known poems include Dark Rosaleen, Siberia, Nameless One, A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century, The Funerals, To the Ruins of Donegal Castle, Pleasant Prospects for the Land-eaters and Woman of Three Cows. He wrote a brief autobiography, on the advice of his friend Charles Patrick Meehan, which ends mid-sentence. This must have been written in the last months of his life, since he mentions his narrative poem of the Italian Gasparo Bandollo, which was published in the Dublin University Magazine in May 1849. Mangan was a lonely and often difficult man who suffered from mood swings, depression and irrational fears, and became a heavy drinker and opium user. There are many descriptions of his personal appearance at this time, all of them dwelling on his spare figure, his tight blue cloak, his witch's hat, his inevitable umbrella. He was described by the artist William Frederick Wakeman as frequently wearing \"a huge pair of green spectacles\", padded shirts to hide his malnourished figure, and a hat which \"resembled those which broomstick-riding witches are usually represented with\". In 1849, weakened by poverty, alcoholism and malnutrition, he succumbed to cholera aged only 46. He was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery."

        "content": "Mangan's poetry fits into a variety of literary traditions. Most obviously, and frequently, his work is read alongside such nationalist political authors as John Mitchel, as they appeared in The Nation, The Vindicator and the United Irishman newspapers; or as a manifestation of the 19th-century Irish Cultural Revival. It is hard not to acknowledge Mangan's debts to such translators and collectors of traditional Irish poetry as Samuel Ferguson and James Hardiman; many of Mangan's poems, for instance Dark Roseleen, appear to be adaptations of earlier translations rather than original translations. Mangan is also frequently read as a Romantic poet. In particular, he is compared to Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas De Quincey, largely thanks to his rumoured opium addiction and tendency to place his writing within the frame of a vision or dream. More recently, critics have begun to read Mangan's work as a precursor to modernist and postmodernist experimental writing. His playful literary hoaxes and fake translations (which he called \"reverse plagiarism\") have been seen as a precursor to the works of Flann O'Brien."

        "content": "During his life and immediately after, Mangan's legacy was co-opted by Irish nationalism, primarily thanks to John Mitchel's biography of Mangan, which stressed that Mangan was \"a rebel with his whole heart and soul against the whole British spirit\". Naturally, this helped to propel Mangan's legacy as Ireland's first national poet, and to lead later Irish writers to look back at his work. James Joyce wrote two essays on Mangan, the first in 1902 and the second in 1907 and also used his name in his works, for instance in Araby in Dubliners. Joyce wrote that in Mangan's poetry \"images interweave [their] soft, luminous scarves and words ring like brilliant mail, and whether the song is of Ireland or of Istambol it has the same refrain, a prayer that peace may come again to her who has lost peace, the moonwhite pearl of his soul\". Joyce also described Mangan as \"a prototype for a would-be-nation\", but stressed that he was ultimately a \"feeble figure\" that fell short of such promise. WB Yeats considered Mangan one of the best Irish poets, along with Thomas Davis and Samuel Ferguson, writing \"To the soul of Clarence Mangan was tied the burning ribbon of Genius.\" Among the contemporary Irish writers he has influenced are Thomas Kinsella; Michael Smith; James McCabe, who wrote a sensationally discovered continuation of Mangan's autobiography that appeared in the Dublin journal Metre in 2001, but was later revealed \u2013 in a Mangan-style hoax \u2013 to be written by McCabe rather than Mangan; and David Wheatley, author of a sonnet sequence on Mangan. He is also cited by songwriter Shane MacGowan as an inspiration for both his work and his lifestyle. McGowan's song \"The Snake with Eyes of Garnet\" features Mangan as a character:"

While Mangan still has not acquired the critical clout of Joyce or Yeats, more recent literary criticism has begun to seriously consider his work. Largely, this can be attributed to the publication of David Lloyd's Nationalism and Minor Literature: James Clarence Mangan and the Emergence of Irish Cultural Nationalism in 1987. Lloyd's work was the first to seriously attempt to untangle Mangan the man from the nationalist poet fostered by John Mitchel. Private papers of Mangan are held in the National Library of Ireland, the Royal Irish Academy, and the archives of Trinity College, Dublin."

The couple had six children, all of whom died in infancy.

In September 1797 he moved to a smaller establishment in Fleet Street. He died on 11 October 1832 at his home in Queen's Row, Pimlico, London. He was buried at Bunhill Fields burial ground, where a granite obelisk, designed by John Woody Papworth, was later erected in his memory."

During the following year, Beyschlag began working as a religious instructor in Mainz. In 1856 he became a court preacher in Karlsruhe, and four years later, he was appointed a professor of practical theology and New Testament exegesis at the University of Halle. Beyschlag was the leader of the Kirchenpartei called Mittelpartei (\"Middle Party\"), and in 1876, with Albrecht Wolters, founded the Deutsch-evangelische Bl\u00e4tter (a publication of the Mittelpartei in the Kirche der Altpreu\u00dfischen Union). Because of the combative nature of the magazine, he was once sued for libel. Also, he was a primary catalyst in the founding of the  (Protestant Confederation) \u2014 he believed that only in unity could German Protestantism find strength. He was a leading supporter of the Vermittlungstheologie and was opposed to Chalcedonian Christology. Also, he stood for the rights of the laity, and believed in the autonomy of the church, leading him to be in favor of separation of church and state. Beyschlag was viewed as an antagonist of the Roman Catholic Church and a sharp critic of  Ultramontanism."

November 9, 1980) was an Asian American character actor, best known for playing Jimmy Chan in the Charlie Chan films and Hop Sing in the western series Bonanza. He was born in San Francisco, California to Gum Yung Sen and his first wife, both immigrants from China. When his mother died during the flu epidemic of 1919, his father placed Victor and his younger sister, Rosemary, in a children's shelter, and returned to his homeland to seek another wife. He returned in 1922 with his new wife, Lovi Shee, once again forming a household with his two children. During his acting career, Victor was given billing under a variety of names, including Sen Yung, Sen Young, Victor Sen Young, and Victor Young."

        "title": "Victor Sen Yung_Career",
        "content": "Victor Sen Yung made his first significant acting debut in the 1937 film Charlie Chan in Honolulu, as the Chinese detective's \"number two son,\" Jimmy Chan. In this movie, Sidney Toler replaced the recently deceased Warner Oland as Charlie Chan and Victor Sen Yung replaced Oland's \"number one son\" Lee, who had been played by Keye Luke. Luke left the series in 1938, leading to the need for a \"number two son\". Victor Sen Yung played Jimmy Chan in 11 Charlie Chan films between 1938 and 1942. Victor Sen Yung played the character of Jimmy Chan much as Luke played Lee Chan, namely as the bumbling, Americanized son who constantly hinders his father's work. The cultural clash between Chan p\u00e8re, a Chinese immigrant whose values fundamentally those of China as expressed in his amusing pseudo-Confucian aphorisms vs. his well meaning, but inept Americanized sons gave the series much of its appeal, together with the fact that for all of Charlie Chan's putdowns of his sons there was a genuine paternal love and warmth being expressed. Moonlighting from the popular Chan series, Victor Sen Yung won critical acclaim playing the nuanced role of Ong Chi Seng, a young attorney assisting Howard Joyce (played by James Stephenson), defending Leslie Crosbie (played by Bette Davis), accused of murder in the classic Warner Bros. film noir melodrama, The Letter (1940), directed by William Wyler. In common with other Chinese-American actors, Sen Yung was cast in Japanese parts during World War II, such as his role as the treacherous Japanese-American Joe Totsuiko in the 1942 Humphrey Bogart film Across the Pacific. During World War II, he joined the U.S. Army Air Forces. During his military service, he was replaced in the Charlie Chan series by Benson Fong, who played \"number three son\", Tommy Chan. Yung's military service included work in training films at the First Motion Picture Unit and a role in the Army Air Forces' play and film Winged Victory. After the war, Sen Yung resumed his Hollywood career. The Charlie Chan series was now in the hands of Monogram Pictures, with Sidney Toler continuing in the leading role. Toler's health was failing by 1946; Monogram was conserving Toler's waning energy, limiting his scenes and giving him long rest periods during filming. To relieve the burden on Toler, Monogram hired his original screen foil, Sen Yung (now billing himself as Victor Sen Yung). He and Mantan Moreland shared much of the footage in Toler's final three films, Dangerous Money, Shadows over Chinatown, and The Trap. The addition of Moreland as Chan's black chauffeur, Birmingham Brown, reflected the fact that by this time the Chan films had a significant following among black Americans, who liked a film series that for once did not feature a white hero.  Following Toler's death in 1947, Victor Sen Yung appeared in five of the remaining six Charlie Chan features. His character \"Jimmy\" was renamed \"Tommy\" (author Scott MacGillivray contends that \"Jimmy\" was so closely associated with Sidney Toler that audiences would miss seeing Toler opposite him, resulting in Monogram making the change). Victor Sen Yung continued to work in motion pictures and television, in roles ranging from featured players (affable or earnest Asian characters) to bit roles (clerks, houseboys, waiters, etc.). Victor Sen Yung was cast as the compassionate Chinese restaurant owner \"Quong Kee\" in Tombstone, Arizona, in the 1957 episode, \"Quong Kee\", of the syndicated television anthology series Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story, an aging Quong Kee recalls how in 1881 he brought together the Bostonians Art Gresham (Walter Kelley) and his mother (played by Mary Newton) with the saloon musician Ann Bailey (Eugenia Paul), who after a topsy-turvy romance became Mrs. Art Gresham. Sen Yung is probably best remembered as \"Hop Sing,\" the cook on the long-running television series Bonanza, appearing in 109 episodes between 1959 and 1973. Bonanza series creator David Dortort told the Archive of American Television that the \"Hop Sing\" character generated massive fandom - \"Victor was just absolutely delightful. He loved the part; he loved doing it. In fact, he began to develop fans, to the extent that I wrote him in as the feature part in a number of shows.\u201d In Bachelor Father (American TV series) (1957-62), Victor Sen Yung had a recurring role as the scheming \"Uncle Charlie,\" a character that Asian rights activist Guy Aoki commends as \"a slick, Americanized character. I thought it was great that way back in the \u201950s, audiences saw a Chinese American who acted just like anyone else.\" In the early 1972s, Sen Yung had a recurring role in seven episodes of the tv series Kung Fu, which starred David Carradine as a Shaolin monk, also in the Old West. Sen Yung was also an accomplished and talented chef. He frequently appeared on cooking programs, and authored The Great Wok Cookbook in 1974."

His body was found November 9, but he had reportedly been dead at least ten days, from possibly around October 31. Some reports suggested that he was murdered, but police ultimately ruled the death accidental. The eulogy at his funeral was given by fellow Bonanza actor Pernell Roberts, who also paid the funeral expenses.

        "content": "Roe was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, where he attended Brown High School. After graduating, he landed a job at General Electric soldering wires. He had a Billboard number 1 hit in the U.S. and Australia in 1962 with the track \"Sheila\". A buildup of global sales of \"Sheila\" meant that the Recording Industry Association of America did not present the gold record until 1969. When \"Sheila\" became a hit in 1962, ABC-Paramount Records asked him to go on tour to promote the hit. He was reluctant to give up his secure job at GE until ABC-Paramount advanced him $5,000. However, in March 1963, the UK music magazine NME reported that he and Chris Montez had both been upstaged by the Beatles and their fans on a 21-day UK tour.  Late that year, Roe scored a Top 10 hit with \"Everybody\", which reached US number 3 and UK number 9, and \"The Folk Singer\" (number 4 UK) written by Merle Kilgore was also popular. Following a more successful tour of the United Kingdom by his friend Roy Orbison, Roe toured there and then moved to England where he lived for several years. In 1964, Roe recorded a song written by Buzz Cason entitled \"Diane From Manchester Square\", about a girl who worked at EMI House when it was based in London's Manchester Square. Sales of this single in the UK were poor, and it failed to chart. During the 1960s, he had several more Top 40 hits, including 1966's number 8 \"Sweet Pea\" (number 1 Canada) and number 6 \"Hooray for Hazel\" (number 2 Canada). In 1969, his song \"Dizzy\" went to number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, number 1 in Canada, as well as number 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. This transatlantic chart-topper sold two million copies by mid-April 1969, giving him his third gold disc award. Roe guest-starred in an episode of the American sitcom Green Acres, titled \"The Four of Spades\", airing on November 8, 1969. His final Top 10 single, a track co-written with Freddy Weller, titled \"Jam Up and Jelly Tight\", became his fourth gold record, peaking at number 8 in the U.S. and number 5 in Canada in 1970. Although his style of music declined in popularity with the 1970s mass market, Roe maintained a following and continued to perform at a variety of concert venues, sometimes with 1960s nostalgia rock and rollers such as Freddy Cannon and Bobby Vee. He recorded numerous singles in the late 1970s and 1980s aimed at the country music market. In 1986, Roe was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Roe's autobiography, originally published in 2016, named From Cabbagetown to Tinseltown and places in between, was co-written with Michael Robert Krikorian. On February 7, 2018, Roe officially announced his retirement on his Facebook page with this statement: On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Tommy Roe among hundreds of artists whose material reportedly was destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire."

        "content": "Saint Dionysius I (); secular name: David (1300? \u2013 October 15, 1385) was a Russian Orthodox metropolitan in 1384\u20131385. A native of the Duchy of Kiev as a young man David entered the Kyiv Caves Lavra, where he was tonsured a hieromonk and given the religious name Dionysius. He is known to have spent a number of years living in a cave that he dug out himself on the banks of the Volga River not far from Nizhny Novgorod. Later, Dionysius founded the Pechersky Monastery on that same spot, which was dedicated in honour of the Ascension of the Lord. In 1374, he was consecrated the Bishop of Suzdal and won love and respect on the part of the locals. In 1378, Dionysius was recommended as Metropolitan of Kyiv by St. Sergius of Radonezh after the death of Metropolitan Alexius. However, Grand Prince Dmitri Donskoi had his own candidate \u2013 a priest by the name of Mikhail (Mityaya). Dionysius was one of a number of bishops at the council who opposed Mikhail, who was suspected of heresy (Strigolniki). If elected, Mikhail wanted to introduce a new way of enthroning the Metropolitan at home, in Russia, rather than traveling to Constantinople to be installed by the Ecumenical Patriarch (at the time, Russia was not yet an autocephalous church). In 1379 Dionysius went to Constantinople carrying a protest against the choice of Mikhail addressed to the Patriarch. Mikhail was afraid that Dionysius would get the patriarch's blessing and followed him to Constantinople. However, Mikhail died on his way there and one of his accompanying clergymen, Archmandrite Pimen, reached Constantinople (Slavonic: Tzargrad) before Dionysius and was named Metropolitan of Moscow and All Rus' in place of Mikhail. In 1382 the Dionysius received the title of archbishop from the Patriarch, who was impressed with his piety and humility. In 1383, Dionysius returned from this long journey to his congregation at Suzdal and continued his struggle against the Strigolniki. He also implored Dmitri Donskoi against Pimen, whom he viewed as a usurper, since no one in the Russian Church, not even the Great Prince himself, had been consulted before Pimen was appointed Metropolitan. In 1384, Dionysius was sent back to Constantinople to ask for Pimen's deposition and his own appointment as Metropolitan. Patriarch Neilus Kerameus was not sure whether he could trust Dionysius and sent two metropolitans to Moscow, who were supposed to depose Pimen and install the archbishop of Suzdal. On his way back to Moscow, Dionysius stopped in Kiev, where he was detained by the Kievan prince Vladimir Olgerdovich at the insistence of Cyprian, Archbishop of Kiev, who was to have succeeded as Metropolitan of Moscow in 1378 upon the death of Alexius, but who was not finally welcomed into Moscow until 1390. Dionysius died in detention on October 15, 1385. He was buried in the Caves of St. Anthony at Kiev, in the monastery in which he began his spiritual life. The Russian Orthodox Church used to celebrate his feast day on July 19, but subsequently this tradition died down. He is now commemorated on October 15 of the traditional Julian Calendar (October 28 on the modern Gregorian Calendar), where he is listed as \"Metropolitan of Suzdal\", since he was never able to take possession of his Metropolitan See."

She was reared by a maternal aunt, Alice Payne, in Baltimore, Maryland, where she attended a Catholic convent school. Mitchell never completed her formal schooling in Baltimore. Following the death of her father, she traveled to New York to spend the summer with her other aunt. She was only fourteen at the time when she was discovered singing from the fire escape of her aunt's apartment  by the composer Will Marion Cook and lyricist Paul Laurence Dunbar for a role in their one-act musical comedy Clorindy: The Origin of the Cakewalk (1898). It was so successful that it ran for the whole season at the Casino Roof Garden. She married Cook a year later, and appeared in the lead role in his Jes Lak White Folks (1899). She also appeared in his production The Southerners (1904). Cook and Mitchell had a daughter, Marion Abigail Cook, in 1900, and a son, Will Mercer Cook, in 1903. In London Mitchell appeared in the 1903 musical In Dahomey, produced by the team of George Walker and Bert Williams, with music composed by her husband Cook, book by J.A. Shipp, and lyrics by poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. The cakewalk, considered old-fashioned by the cast, was almost cut from the show, but proved popular with audiences. It became a fad in the United Kingdom. Mitchell received international acclaim for her performance, and was invited to appear with the company in a Royal Command Performance for King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra at Buckingham Palace. Mitchell later performed with the \"Black Patti's Troubadours\", and in the operetta The Red Moon (1908) by Bob Cole and J. Rosamond Johnson.

Mitchell appeared in several Broadway plays including \"In Abraham's Bosom\" (1926), \"Coquette\" (1927) starring Helen Hayes, and \"The Little Foxes\" (1939) starring Tallulah Bankhead. Mitchell was best known for performing in the role of Clara in the premiere of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess (1935); this was her last musical role on the stage. She was the first singer to record \"Summertime\" from the opera. After this, \"she taught and coached many singers in New York and appeared in many 'spoken' dramatic roles on the stage.\" In 1939, she played the role of Tallulah Bankhead's intelligent and trusted servant in The Little Foxes on Broadway. She also performed in New York City in other productions and taught at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Lee De Forest made a short film, Songs of Yesteryear (1922), of Mitchell singing, using his DeForest Phonofilm sound-on-film process. This film is preserved in the Maurice Zouary film collection at the Library of Congress. Their daughter, raised by family members as Mitchell had been, married dancer Louis Douglas. Their son became a professor at Howard University and a translator, and was later appointed as United States Ambassador to Niger and Senegal.<ref>\"Mercer Cook Biography \", 'The History Makers.</ref> Mitchell died in New York on March 16, 1960, and was given a Catholic funeral."

Born in Shediac, New Brunswick, in a big family, he attended College Saint Joseph in Memramcook, New Brunswick. At an early age he wrote a book on the Origin of Acadians, a history that contradicted myths of the time. He also wrote multiple articles and a glossary of the Acadian French language. After finishing school at the College Saint-Joseph in Memramcook during 1872, Poirier was appointed Postmaster of the Dominion Parliament at age 20.  He held that position until he was appointed to the Senate thirteen years later. Poirier was the first Acadian appointed to the Senate of Canada. He was appointed in 1885 and served for 48 years, 6 months, and 17\u00a0days until his death in 1933. As the Constitution of Canada requires new senators to be at least 30 years old and (since 1965) to leave the Senate when they reach 75, Poirier's record can never be exceeded unless the constitution is amended again to allow it. The Pascal Poirier House (built c. 1820\u201330) was designated a Provincial Historic Site under the Historic Sites Protection Act.  The home he was born in has been preserved as a museum and as an important and rare example of early-19th-century Acadian residential construction.  The -storey gabled house, which features a hand-hewn structure, is believed to be the oldest building in Shediac. He was honored as a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur by France in 1902."

        "content": "Katarina Frostenson's work is frequently described as performing a kind of linguistic skepticism (the belief that language is perpetually insufficient to represent reality or contain any essential truth), and as isolating the paradox of using language as the means of its own critique or deconstruction. These limits of language in calling forth reality and experience is also one of the main themes of Katarina Frostenson's work. Her poetry attempts to bring forth experience rather than describe it. In her poetry collections, Frostenson combines shorter poems and longer narrative poems, often with a sense of fragmentation that attempt to convey images or emotions of a specific moment. Along with a group of other Swedish women poets emerging in the 1980s such as Ann J\u00e4derlund and Birgitta Lillpers, Frostenson's work evinces an attempt to communicate outside of a realm dominated by male writers, focusing on sounds and image rather than a united logos and coherent semantics. Frostenson's poetry stands out in Swedish literary history for its radical linguistic experimentation through a blend of the archaic and the avant-garde; its focus on the intricate sonic qualities of the Swedish language; its references to classical mythology, folksongs, ballads, and canonical Western literary and philosophical figures; and its general lack of metaphor and descriptive language. Her work is orientated towards drawing attention to the material elements of language, that is, sounds, while also being attuned to, playing with, and deconstructing the semantic elements formed out of the phonetic building blocks in search of a purer, authentic or genuine kind of language. One could say that Frostenson attempts to eliminate all barriers which disrupt emotional and sensory communication. The experience of language's shortcomings is more authentic than its inability to communicate truth. Rather than relying on metaphors and complex attempts at reproducing in language the complexities of human experience, Frostenson's poetry instead gathers fragments of images, emotions, and sounds. Often, each image or feeling appears with an unexpected opposition, creating a dissonance of meaning. For Frostenson, the human senses are more faithful to experience and thus more trustworthy than language as a means of communication. Frostenson's oeuvre is one of the most influential in Swedish literature. Known first and foremost as a poet, she has published fourteen collections of poetry as well as several works of prose, drama, (creative) nonfiction, translations from French, as well as the libretto for Sven-David Sandstr\u00f6m\u2019s opera Staden (The City, 1998). In addition to being nominated for Sweden\u2019s largest literary prize, the August Prize, three times (for Joner in 1991, for Tal och regn [Speech and Rain] in 2008, and for Tre v\u00e4gar [Three Paths] in 2013), Frostenson has won nearly all the poetry prizes in Sweden and in 2016 was awarded the Nordic Council Literature Prize for her 2015 collection S\u00e5nger och formler (Songs and Formulae). She was made a knight of the French Legion of Honor in 2003. Her work has been translated into over ten languages, most notably to French and German (the latter, she has stated, is the language to which her work translates best)."

        "title": "Katarina Frostenson_Joner (1991)",
        "content": "Frostenson's most notable poetry collection is Joner (Ions) from 1991, which is considered her major breakthrough, a milestone in her authorship and a canonical, watershed moment in the Swedish poetic tradition. It is inspired by the gruesome murder of Catrine da Costa, whose remains were found dismembered in two plastic bags, her head was never found, and her murder was never solved. The case would also inspire at least two groundbreaking literary works, including Stieg Larsson\u2019s crime novel M\u00e4n som hatar kvinnor (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, 2005) and Sara Stridsberg's novel K\u00e4rlekans Antarktis (Antarctica of Love).  At that time the author of six collections of poetry, Joner brought Frostenson the attention that would result in her election to the Swedish Academy the following year. Given Frostenson\u2019s then established public persona as mysterious, esoteric, and (at least somewhat) elitist, no one had expected Frostenson to engage in public debate, let alone the debate surrounding da Costa\u2019s murder, and the image of her dead body. As Cecelia Sj\u00f6holm writes,the weight of Frostenson\u2019s text cannot by detached from the emblematic importance of a beheaded woman that Frostenson was evoking, indicating a wide array of literary and philosophical questions that can be raised by the image of a severed female body. Intertwining an Orphic theme where the positions of Orpheus and Eurydice are reversed, Frostenson examines the question of representation through an actual event and its treatment in the media while invoking the complexities of the Orphic myth; its space and time are shown to be gendered.In addition to presenting the intertextual and gendered intricacies of Frostenson\u2019s poetic language, Sj\u00f6holm\u2019s claims offer a counterpoint to the received perception of Frostenson as a poet \u201cwithout social relevance,\" which some scholars such as Anders Olsson have pointed out."

The club received funding from the Swedish Academy, which sparked allegations of conflicts of interest. Thus in 2018, Frostenson was accused of corruption contemporaneous with the accusations of sexual assault and corruption leveled against Arnault. Frostenson was also accused of having leaked names of Nobel Prize laureates to Arnault before they were announced. However, it was discovered that it was commonplace for family members of Academy members to know who was receiving the prize ahead of announcement, according to Ebba Witt-Brattstr\u00f6m, ex-wife of Academy member Horace Engdahl. The Academy ultimately decided against expelling Frostenson, which prompted the resignation of three academy members. Frostenson protested that she should not be punished for the wrongdoings of her husband. Nevertheless, she did ultimately and voluntarily withdraw from the academy receiving a lifelong compensation of 12,875 Swedish kronor per month and the right to continue to live in an apartment owned by the Academy."

        "content": "Vincent Hanley (born in Clonmel, County Tipperary on 2 April 1954, died in Dublin on 18 April 1987) was a pioneering Irish radio DJ and television presenter, nicknamed \"Fab Vinny\". He worked mainly for Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann, and was the first Irish celebrity to die from an AIDS-related illness. He has been described as \"Ireland's first gay celebrity\". Hanley began presenting pop music shows on RT\u00c9 Radio Cork in 1976. He also did stints in Dublin on RT\u00c9 Radio 1 and RT\u00c9 television, including a special on Gilbert O'Sullivan. When the first dedicated pop station, RT\u00c9 Radio Two (now branded 2FM), was started in 1979, he was one of its best-known DJs. While in Dublin he shared accommodation with Charles Self. In 1981, he moved to London to work for Capital Radio. In 1984, he declined a lucrative offer to remain there and moved to New York City. Hanley founded Green Apple Productions in 1983 with Conor McAnally, an RT\u00c9 television producer and son of actor Ray McAnally. The company produced MT-USA (Music Television USA), a three-hour-long music video show modelled on the new American cable channel, MTV. MT-USA was broadcast on RT\u00c9 from 1984\u201387 on Sunday afternoons. Each block of videos was followed by a segment filmed in New York City with Hanley introducing the videos, discussing American music and culture, and interviewing a celebrity. RT\u00c9 described him as Europe's first VJ (video jockey). In 1987, Hanley died shortly after his 33rd birthday. He had been visibly ill for some time, and was rumoured to have an AIDS-related illness, which he denied. This reflected the stigma then associated with the disease and with homosexuality in Ireland, which was not decriminalised until 1993. The illness admitted by Hanley was congenital cerebral toxoplasmosis, described as an \"eye disorder\"; he was blind in one eye by his death. Toxoplasmosis is very rarely fatal in adults who do not have a weakened immune system. In 2000, Hanley's friend and colleague Bill Hughes, who had himself come out in the 1990s, agreed that Hanley had in fact died of an AIDS-related illness. The same year, the Sunday Tribune newspaper placed Hanley at the top of a list of Irish gay icons. In February 2022, RTE aired a new documentary about Hanley, titled Vincent Hanley: Sex, Lies and Videotapes. It revealed that Hanley was not only a user of cocaine himself, but had introduced others to the drug too."

        "content": "Memphis Bleek was one of the first artists signed to Roc-A-Fella, as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to Jay-Z. He grew up in Brooklyn's Marcy Projects, located in Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, the same neighborhood as Jay-Z. He appears on the Jay-Z albums: Reasonable Doubt, Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life, Vol. 3\u2026 Life and Times of S. Carter, The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, and The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse. Bleek's first official appearance was \"Coming of Age\" from Reasonable Doubt. After the huge success of Hard Knock Life and the exposure of the Roc-A-Fella camp, (a Memphis Bleek track off the aforementioned Jay-Z album, \"It's Alright\", actually charted on Billboard), the label released Memphis Bleek's debut album, Coming of Age. The album was the week's Hot Shot Debut on the Billboard 200, peaking at #7 with 118,000 units sold in its first week. The name \"Memphis\", which the rapper explained paid homage to pimps, was an acronym for \"Making Easy Money, Pimping Hoes In Style\" while \"Bleek\" had been a childhood nickname, given to him by his younger sister. He has released three more albums since his debut, The Understanding, M.A.D.E., and 534 (Out of the three, The Understanding was certified Gold by the RIAA). In between the release of The Understanding and M.A.D.E., he took a three-year hiatus, in which time he took care of his older brother, who was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. There are three significant notes to take away from the album 534, which was named after the building number of the housing project, where he and Jay-Z grew up. First, it was the debut release from the \"new\" Roc-A-Fella, referring to Jay-Z becoming President of Def Jam. It also contains the first official Def Jam recording by label mate turned international star, Rihanna, who featured on the song \"The One\". And lastly, this album marks the time in which Jay-Z released his first song since beginning his brief \"retirement\" in late 2003. The song was called \"Dear Summer\", in reference to what Jay called the time of the year when he would drop a classic album or single every year for eight straight years, and how he had to metaphorically leave \"her\", Summer. Memphis Bleek's highest charting single was \"Is That Yo Chick\", featuring Missy Elliott and Jay-Z, which peaked at #7 on the Hot Rap Singles Billboard Chart, and only one of two songs by the artist to crack the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #68, and the only track to appear on one of his solo albums. The other single being \"It's Alright\", appearing on the Hard Knock Life album by Jay-Z, peaking at #61 on the Billboard Hot 100. He has had countless collaborations with fellow hip-hop artists such as DMX, Ja Rule, T.I., and Trick Daddy, with many of the features coming with other Roc-A-Fella artists, including Beanie Sigel, Freeway, Cam'ron, Amil, Young Gunz, and of course Jay-Z. In fall 2005, Memphis Bleek told MTV that he was recording an album called The Process, that he would describe as a make or break album, saying \"I want to do an album that's through the roof, I want to do a classic album. I feel that if this album I'm not recording is a classic, I'm not even gonna put it out. I have to do it bigger than anybody has ever done it. I have to make a good record this time, not just talking-junk records.\" The rapper has worked on the album since 2005 and during that time frame he would release the songs \"Hustla\", \"Get Ya Money Off\" and \"Let It Off\". During this time, he would also leave Roc-A-Fella after Jay-Z told him he could run his own company and had the proper distribution deals to do so. He found a new home in 2009 when he signed to Mass Appeal Entertainment. In the summer of 2010, he backed Jay-Z on stage, during a performance at the Swedish festival Peace&Love. On April 10, 2012, Memphis Bleek, working with The Liberty Music Group, re-released \"The Movement\". The release went on to garnish over 125,000 Downloads. On June 6, 2012, Memphis Bleek, working again with The Liberty Music Group, released \"KG Vol. 2\". The release went on to garnish over 59,000 Downloads and get a 3/5 Review from XXL Writer Adam Fleischer. On March 21, 2014, Memphis Bleek released \"The Movement 2\" as a mixtape for free download."

        "content": "Dudok initially chose to pursue a military career. At the military academy of Breda he studied civil engineering and was allowed to assist in designing military buildings. Influenced by other Dutch architects, such as Berlage, he rapidly proved able to adapt his own ideas. He was appointed Assistant Director of Public Works in Leiden in 1913 and Director of Public Works in Hilversum in 1915. He was appointed Hilversum's Municipal Architect in 1928. The same year he was assigned the task of expanding the city, which involved designing housing estates, schools, swimming pools and parks and gardens. While his early style in Hilversum grew out of the Amsterdam School, the dramatic massing, asymmetry, the overhanging eaves and other elements of his landmark Hilversum City Hall were clearly influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright and the Chicago Prairie School. The City Hall is regarded as his masterpiece and manages to merge the requirements of being both a symbol of the city and an efficient administrative building. It is indicative of the garden-city character of Hilversum. Indeed, Dudok was clearly influenced by Ebenezer Howard and Raymond Unwin, pioneers of the garden-city movement in the United Kingdom. Dudok continued to produce progressive, Dutch modernist structures in Hilversum for decades, through the 1960s, and had international influence. Amongst school designers in the Netherlands, his schools in Hilversum became particularly celebrated. Dudok was also the architect of the branch of the De Bijenkorf department store in Rotterdam, a spectacular piece of commercial architecture clearly influenced by the Bauhaus, de Stijl, and the streamlining that was popular in both Art Deco and Art Moderne modernist design of the 1920s and 1930s. When it opened in 1930, some 70,000 people attended the event. While it was partly destroyed in the German bombing of Rotterdam in May 1940 during the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands, numerous photographs, plans and other material documenting the structure's design and the structure have survived and recently aided in the production of a Dutch documentary on Dudok's department store. Dudok received the RIBA Gold Medal in 1935 and the AIA Gold Medal in 1955. He also designed the Coll\u00e8ge n\u00e9erlandais in the Cit\u00e9 Universitaire in Paris, a cultural centre in Baghdad and a cinema in Calcutta. One of the buildings he designed in Rotterdam now houses a cafe-restaurant named after him. He drew up plans for the rebuilding of The Hague after WW2. This involved a new district for 150,000 people in the southwest of the city. He died, aged 89, in Hilversum."

Monsignore Ferdinando Baldelli, Carlo Egger and Otto Faller started on behalf of the pope the official Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza. Madre Pascalina was asked by the Pope to direct his personal charity efforts, officially under Monsignor Montini, later Pope Paul VI, with whom she seemed to have a complicated relationship. To assist the pope in the many calls for his help and charity, Pascalina organized and led the Magazzino, a private papal charity office which employed up to 40 helpers and continued until 1959. \"It started from modest beginnings and became a gigantic charity.\" By Christmas 1944, housing had been provided at the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo, a papal residence in Castel Gandolfo, for 15,000 refugees from the invading Nazi forces. Inside the Vatican, Mother Pascalina was in charge of housing, clothing and food for as many Jewish refugees as the walls could hold. By the end of the war, no less than 200,000 Jews had been sheltered and fed inside the Holy City under her supervision. In addition to this, 12,000 packages were delivered to the children of Rome alone, many of which were handed out by Pope Pius XII himself. Lehnert organized truck caravans filled with medicine, clothing, shoes and food to prison camps and hospitals, provided first aid, food and shelter for bomb victims, fed the hungry population of Rome, answered emergency calls to the Pope for aid, and sent care packages to France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria and other countries. After the war, the calls for papal help continued in war-torn Europe: Madre Pascalina organized emergency aid to displaced persons, prisoners of war, victims of floods, and many victims of the war. She distributed also hundreds of religious items to needy priests. In later years, priests with very large parishes received small cars or motor bikes. The Pope would ask bishops from the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Switzerland, Canada, Mexico, and other countries for help."

Despite the DJ John Peel being a fan of their music, they never released any material, recording only an unreleased single at Open Eye Studios, in Liverpool and playing a few gigs in the North-West, most notably supporting Cabaret Voltaire at Nathan McGough's Plato's Ballroom in 1981, before disbanding the same year. In 1983, he became involved with three bands. He joined The Cure as bassist, playing for some European and UK live\u2013TV dates, and formed two bands, Dynamo Futurista and The Umbrella. The latter group, consisting of Noko (guitar and vocals), Simon Hoare (drums), Mark Sanderson (bass) and James Gardner, released a total of three songs before folding, which were released on an EP called Make Hell (For The Beautiful People). Founder Buzzcock and Magazine frontman, Howard Devoto, started writing with Noko in 1986 with a view to putting a band together to play Factory Records' Festival of the Tenth Summer at the G-Mex arena in Manchester that summer to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Punk. They played a short set as Adultery, borrowing backline from The Smiths. (Noko also played a set with Pete Shelley at the same gig in a line-up that also included ex-Magazine drummer John Doyle). The line-up for that Adultery show was: Howard Devoto \u2013 vocals, Noko \u2013 lead guitar/viola, Leroy James \u2013 keyboards/2nd guitar, Pete Kinski \u2013 bass, Simon Hoare \u2013 drums. Signing to Beggars Banquet in 1987 and deciding on the name Luxuria, Devoto and Noko released two LPs: Unanswerable Lust (1988) and Beastbox (1990) and toured Europe and USA throughout 1988 with a line-up of Devoto and Noko on vocals/guitars and viola as usual and Karl Leiker \u2013 bass, Mark Rowlett \u2013 Drums/Sequential Studio 440, James Gardner \u2013 keyboards, programming, Frog \u2013 guitar/keyboards. The final Luxuria gig at The Town & Country Club (now the London Forum) in London featured cameo appearances by Barry Adamson (bass) on a rendition of Magazine's \"The Light Pours Out of Me\" for an encore, and Morrissey, who read a passage of Marcel Proust's \"A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu\" over the intro of \"Mademoiselle\" before throwing the tattered book into the crowd as the band kicked into the song. (There is a bootleg recording of the gig in circulation). When Luxuria folded in 1990, Noko got together with school friends, brothers Trevor Gray and Howard Gray, and James Gardner and formed Apollo 440. The band released a number of singles and EPs on their own StealthSonic Recordings label: \"Lolita\" (1990), \"Destiny\" (1991), \"Blackout\" (1992) and \"Lolita/Destiny '92\" (1992). Apollo 440 made four albums: Millennium Fever (1995), ElectroGlide In Blue (1997), Gettin' High On Your Own Supply (1999), and Dude Descending A Staircase (2003) on Sony Records. The band have been playing live in one form or another since their inception in 1990 to the present day and chronologically the touring line-ups are as follows: 1990\u20131992: The band featured all founding members on keyboards, sequencers and drum machines and MCs Stevie Hyper-D and Tigga-Max guesting from time to time on vocals. 1993\u20131995: James Gardner left for New Zealand where he has since established himself as a prominent composer writing music for his ensemble 175 East. Noko moved over to electric guitar and lead vocals, Trevor Gray on keyboards, Howard Gray on bass, and ex-Modern Eon drummer Cliff Hewitt was added to the line-up first on electronic, then onto acoustic drums. (Kenny Cougar briefly replaced Rej on bass during 1999). 1996\u20132000: Noko \u2013 guitar, Trevor Gray \u2013 keyboards, Howard Gray \u2013 vibe controller/live-mix, Cliff Hewitt \u2013 drums, Paul Kodish \u2013 drums, Reinallt Ap Gwynnedd \u2013 bass, Mary Byker (ex-Gaye Bykers on Acid) \u2013 lead vocals, Harry-K \u2013 DJ/vocals.

The band released only one EP via Morrissey's Attack imprint (I'm Unbearable/Born That Way) and the two musicians parted early 2005 after touring with a full band line-up on Morrissey's European and UK dates including his Meltdown festival appearance at the Royal Festival Hall supporting the newly reformed New York Dolls. That line-up included Paul Kodish on drums, Simeon Bowring on bass, and Ashley Krajewski on keyboards. In November 2008, Noko was announced as the guitarist of the reformed Magazine, joining his former collaborators Howard Devoto, Barry Adamson, John Doyle and Dave Formula. In summer 2009, Magazine played \"The Soap Show: Episode 2009\" at the Royal Festival Hall. It was shown in two halves, the first of which was The Correct Use Of Soap LP in its original running order followed by the B-sides and the song \"Upside Down\" which had never been performed live before. They also played selected European festivals with a set culled from the \"Real Life & Thereafter\" tour. The band rounded off the year's activities with appearances on BBC TV's Later... with Jools Holland and the BBC Electric Proms. Magazine have released a brand new live DVD and CD, Real Life & Thereafter: Live at Manchester Academy 17.02.09. 2009 also saw the completion and release of Noko's first full movie score. Une Affaire D'etat, a French-language political thriller based on best-selling novel Nos Fantastiques Ann\u00e9es Fric by Dominique Manotti was directed by \u00c9ric Valette and stars Andr\u00e9 Dussollier, Thierry Fr\u00e9mont and Rachida Brakni. European cinema release was in October of that year. A soundtrack CD is available on Milan Musique. 2010 also saw the formation of Raw Chimp with Noko (guitar/vocals), his wife Deborah Fisher-Jones (bass), and Constance Kaler (lead vocals). Raw Chimp played their live debut that same year at the Download Festival. Noko also scored  \u00c9ric Valette's next movie, The Prey which was released in France in April 2011 with worldwide distribution to follow later in 2012. Another French-language thriller, it was written by Laurent Turner and the movie's producer Luc Bossi, The Prey stars Albert Dupontel, Alice Taglioni, St\u00e9phane Debac and Sergi Lopez. It's a dark high-octane edgy chase movie starting in a prison and culminating in a tense mountain denouement. The score is essential orchestral with touches of electronica and a multitude of Noko's trademark guitar-textures. The soundtrack CD is again available on Milan Musique. Magazine completed their No Thyself LP at the end of 2011, the first new material from the band since 1981's Magic, Murder and the Weather, which was released on the Wire-Sound label. The band toured the UK in November. The LP and tour and BBC radio session were the first to feature new bass-player Stan White who replaced Barry Adamson. Apollo 440's fifth LP The Future's What It Used to Be was released at the beginning of 2012 and the group continue to play live. In 2012, Noko stepped in on bass guitar and backing vocals with London neo-grunge trio Levyathan, alongside Simon Maxwell on drums and David Norris on guitar and lead vocals. The band recorded a Noko-produced debut LP later that year at Apollo Control but it was never released. In February 2013, Noko and Brad Lee from Discoordinated performed at Matthew Glamorre's multi-media series of art-happenings, C.R.U.X. at Zero-One Gallery in Hopkins St. Soho, London W1. They revisited their 2-man version of Roxy Music's classic, \"In Every Dream Home a Heartache\", last performed in 2007. In March 2013, Noko composed and performed his one-man live music score on electric guitar to Theatre Of Post Eroticism's production of BDSM Faust : an adaption of Johann Wolfgang Goethe's 1808 \"Faust\" (Part 1). There was another UK run of the production in June and the show was performed in Romania later in the year. In 2014, Noko co-wrote/ co-produced some tracks for Japanese guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei's LP New Beginnings (released in Japan Virgin/Universal TYCT-60046). These were \"Sons Of Sorrow\", \"New Chemical\" and \"Barrel Of My Own Gun\". Noko played bass guitar on \"Sons Of Sorrow\" and \"Barrel Of My Own Gun\" and vocals on \"Barrel of my own Gun\" and \"New Chemical\". When Hotei later signed to Universal's Spinefarm imprint, this LP was repackaged with some extra tracks for release outside of Japan as Strangers (SPINE663762) and included a re-worked version of \"New Chemical\" titled \"Move It\", featuring a lead vocal by Richard Z. Kruspe from Rammstein. It was at Noko's suggestion that Hotei approached Iggy Pop to sing two other tracks on the album, which became \"How The Cookie Crumbles\" and \"Walking Through The Night\". Hotei and Noko have been friends since 1997, first meeting when Apollo 440 remixed one of Hotei's tracks. They share a birthday, having both been born on exactly the same day, 1 February 1962. Since 2014 Noko has periodically toured with Hotei in Europe, U.S. and Japan, playing bass guitar in various line-ups, including drummers Steve Barney, Cliff Hewitt and Zachary Alford. Later in 2014, Noko produced and mixed Pop Will Eat Itself's \"Reclaim The Game (Funk FIFA)\" unofficial Brazil World Cup 2014 theme featuring Brazilian rap artist BNeg\u00e3o. Noko went on to produce and mix some tracks for the band's 2015 Anti-Nasty League album (RUMJOINT0005): \"Sacrifice And Pain\", \"Director's Cut\" and \"Mental Pollution\" (to which he had a writing contribution), playing additional guitar, bass and various keyboard/programming enhancements along the way. This led to the band he formed with Brad Lee, $HirtLiftA supporting PWEI on their UK tour that summer: Brad Lee on vocals, Noko on guitar and Frank Horovich on guitar and electronics. In 2016, Noko reunited with Matthew Glamorre to form SCISM, the 'house-band' at his SCISM audio-visual, multi-media art-happening nightclub on EU Referendum night in London. They recorded and released \"Dalston Bump\" to coincide with a series of events at Vogue Fabrics in Dalston. In Summer 2017 SCISM played a set at Churchtown festival in Cornwall and again in September at The Bargehouse in London as part of Open London weekend. In April 2017, Magazine released the vinyl-only \"Old World Charm\" (WIRED42) : 6 tracks recorded at the BBC Electric Proms at Roundhouse, London in 2009. The Graeme Oxby pic on the rear of the sleeve featured Noko's MXR 'flanger-on-a-stick'. Noko composed and produced the music score for director Darren Cavanagh's feature-length documentary Ex-Dominatrix, for release in December 2017. The movie opened the 2019 London Fetish Film Festival, at which it won Best Feature. In 2017, Noko and Mary Byker started work recording a body of songs that would become the debut Am I Dead Yet? album, which was released on the Wire-Sound label in April 2019 (WIRED#48). A 5-track remix EP, \u201cNever Mind The Bolex\u2026Am I Dead Yet? reimagined on 35mm\u201d(WIRED#49), which featured cinematic dub remixes of some of the album highlights, was released as a download only, free with advance-orders of the album during the crowd-fun run-up to the actual release. Live dates promoting the album saw the live line-up expanded with the addition of Cliff Hewitt from Apollo 440 on drums and Derek \u2018Hoodlum Priest\u2019 Thompson on bass guitar."

        "content": "The nature of the Apollo 440 remix and production process means Noko has played on too many records by other artists to list usefully here. StealthSonicSoul was an alter-ego spin-off project by the three members of Apollo 440. One release \"StealthSonicSoul\" came out in 1992 on Scottish 23rd Precinct affiliated Limbo label. A further track \"StealthSonic Sun In Her Hair\" appeared on a Limbo compilation the following year. The EZ Drum & Bass Orchestra consisted of Noko and Frederick Pasquan and made one commercially available EP \"Beat Girl\" b/w \"EZ Beat Girl\" and \"Slow Beat Girl\" on the Sliced label in 1996. The duo also remixed a number of other artists e.g. \"Carrerra Rapida -EZ Drum&Bass Orchestra Remix\" by Apollo 440 on Sony in 1997. Noko played bass in 1991 on the Total Abandon EP and Jubilee Twist LP in 1992  by The Heart Throbs, a group from Reading who folded in 1993. Noko played a number of gigs with the band in 1991 and was in the line up that was joined onstage on 25 October of that year by Only Ones frontman, Peter Perrett at Underworld, Camden Town,London, for a version of The Only Ones' \"Lovers Of Today\" along with a few other songs. In the same year, he played abstract guitar on the song \"Ventriloquists and Dolls\" from Momus's album Hippopotamomus. In 1992, Noko produced the one and only LP by Hyperhead, Metaphasia, which came out on the Devotion label. The band was formed by Mary Byker. After Gaye Bykers on Acid split, Mary joined and toured with industrial supergroup Pigface before forming Hyperhead, which included contributions from his Pigface colleagues Martin Atkins (also formerly of PiL and Killing Joke) and William Tucker (also previously of Revolting Cocks and My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult), along with bassist Karl Leiker (who had previously played with Noko in Luxuria) and guitarist Paul Dalloway. Also in 1992, Noko collaborated with Stuart Crichton as Johnny Potatohead, releasing a single, \"Johnny Potatohead\" on Reverb Records. On 14 July 1998, Apollo 440 played \"La Nuit Electronique\" concert with Jean Michel Jarre, with whom they had collaborated twice that year : firstly on the single \"Rendezvous '98\"  (which became the ITV World Cup Theme in UK and reached #10 in the singles chart) and an @440 remix of \"Oxygene 10\". Apollo performed the two tracks live onstage with JMJ in front of the Eiffel Tower to an audience of over 600,000. It was Bastille Day and only two days before, France had won the World Cup. Immediately after they won on 12th, the Mayor of Paris asked Jarre to put together this impromptu free concert for the people of Paris to extend the euphoria. At the climax of the show, an enormous firework display went off on the Eiffel tower behind the stage. This was the largest concert Noko has ever played. Noko and both Gray brothers all played synthesiser and Jean Michel Jarre played theremin. From 2002\u20132004, Noko was involved as Producer/Musical Director for The Prada Meinhof Gang, an all-female Art-Terrorist troupe active between 2002\u20132004, whose activities included performance/installations at the Venice Biennalle, Tate Britain, ICA etc. Their track \"Want Is Your Master\" was included on the free CD compilation that accompanied the \"Music\" issue of Modern Painters magazine. In March 2007, Apollo 440 played the \"A Tribute To Billy MacKenzie\" charity concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire alongside British Electric Foundation (their first ever live show),Glenn Gregory (Heaven 17), Claudia Br\u00fccken (Propaganda) and Paul Humphries (OMD) and Paul Haig, amongst others. It was 10 years after his death. Apollo, with Ewan MacFarlane on vocals closed the show with \"Pain In Any Language\" from their 2nd LP Electroglide In Blue. This collaboration was the last song MacKenzie finished before his tragic suicide only weeks later. The Apollo set also included their cover of The Smiths' \"William, it was really nothing\" - the only time it was ever performed live. Noko made his feature-film debut with a brief cameo appearance as an accordion-playing Parisian street musician in \u00c9ric Valette's Une Affaire D'Etat movie in 2009. He also had a cameo in \u00c9ric Valette's next movie La Proie in 2011 as a harpsichord player in a music-recital scene set in a prison which culminates in a full-scale riot. In 2011, Noko contributed guitar to two tracks on The Organ Of Corti, an LP by Magazine's Dave Formula and cellist Christine Hanson. After the passing of Pete Shelley in December 2018, Noko was asked to perform with the current Buzzcocks, Steve Diggle, Danny Farrant and Chris Remington, at a special memorial concert at London's Royal Albert Hall on 21 June. The concert featured original Buzzcocks drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey alongside a number of special guests, including Pauline Murray (Penetration), Captain Sensible (The Damned), Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth), Peter Perrett (The Only Ones), Richard Jobson (Skids), Dave Vanian (The Damned) and Tim Burgess (The Charlatans). Noko played Pete Shelley's guitar parts and solos for the duration of the show, which was MC'd by Paul Morley and included tributes by original Buzzcocks manager and New Hormones label founder Richard Boon, original Buzzcock  Howard Devoto, who provided a short film featuring a world premiere of a Buzzkunst track that he'd recorded with Pete, but was never released and, to end the show, a eulogy and special thanks from Pete's wife Greta. Appropriately, Noko played two songs, \"Boredom\" and \"Time's Up\" on a red 1960s Starway guitar - the same model made famous by Pete during the early Spiral Scratch days of the band, with its missing top-section."

        "content": "For Apollo 440 live, throughout the late 1990s Noko used the following guitars: a green Parker Fly Classic, a blue Parker Fly Deluxe and a pink Fender 1962 reissue Stratocaster through a pair of Digitech 2112 rack FX units, an 1980s Roland GP-8 and Fender Twins, but whilst the guitars remain the same, the preamps have been upgraded to Digitech GSP 1101 units with Control 2 foot controller through either a Marshall JCM2000 TSL through a Marshall 1960AX 4x12\" cab or a Marshall EL34 50/50 power-amp and a pair of 4x12\"s Noko's 2017 @440 rig was the same 3 guitars into a Kemper Powerack (Fender Tube Reverb tank in FX loop) into a Marshall 1936 2 x 12\" cab with a pedalboard incorporating Kemper Remote, a Boss DM-3 and a Boss FT-2  in conjunction with 2 EV-5 expression pedals. While he was touring with Magazine in 2009, Noko used a pair of green Yamaha SG1500 guitars with an MXR dyna comp, MXR flanger, Boss DM-3 and Boss PS-5. The flanger was stand-mounted as per John McGeoch and Robin Simon's setup with the band in the late 1970s. For amplification, Noko used two late 1970s Marshall JMP 2x12\" combos with Marshall 4x12'cabinets and a Fender Twin. A Variax 700 Acoustic was used for the intro of \"I Want To Burn Again\" through another late 1970s MXR flanger. Noko used a 1978 Black Ovation Magnum II bass guitar with Levyathan through a Boss CE-2 and boss OC-2 into a Sansamp Bass Driver and EBS Fafner Bass rig. A jetglow '74 Rickenbacker 4001 was used for one or two gigs during his time with the band. Whilst on tour with Tomoyasu Hotei, Noko's bass rig was as follows : Ibanez Black Eagle(Reissue), 1978 Antoria Snow Eagle, 1982 G&L L-1000(natural), 1978 Ovation Magnum II (black) into : EBS Fafner MkI through EBS Neo 210 and EBS Neo 115 cabs, with the top-end (up an octave through electroharmonix POG2) split through Kemper Powerack into Marshall 1936 cab. Noko's 2019 live rig for both Apollo 440 and Am I Dead Yet? is the same 3 guitars into the Kemper and either a Mission Engineering Gemini GM-2 FRFR system, or a Matrix GT800FX stereo power amp and stereo Marshall 1960 4x12\"cab(s) for international shows. His pedalboard now includes an Xotic EP boost and the Boss FT-2 and Fender reverb tank have gone. Two Gretsch White Falcons (single and double cut-aways) were used extensively during the making of the Am I Dead Yet? album, but not live shows, so far. For the Pete Shelley Memorial show with The Buzzcocks at London's Royal Albert Hall, he used Pete's old Marshall JCM-900 and a sunburst late '70s Ibanez AR-300 Artist, his green Yamaha SG-1500 and a red 1960s Starway J-1. The only pedals were MXR Flanger, Xotic EP boost and Boss Hyper Fuzz."

        "content": "Van de Velde was ranked 152 in the world, and with only one previous European Tour victory, when he nearly achieved an upset victory at the 1999 Open Championship at Carnoustie. Going into the final round, he held a five shot lead over Justin Leonard and Craig Parry. Van de Velde arrived at the 18th tee with a three shot lead, needing only a double bogey six to become the first Frenchman since 1907 to win a major golf tournament. He had played error-free golf for much of the week and birdied the 18th hole in two previous rounds at the tournament. Van de Velde chose to use his driver off the tee, and he drove the ball to the right of the burn, where he was lucky to find land. Rather than laying up and hitting the green with his third, Van de Velde decided to go for the green with his second shot. His shot drifted right, ricocheted backwards off the railings of the grandstands by the side of the green, landed on top of the stone wall of the Barry Burn and then bounced fifty yards backwards into knee-deep rough. On his third shot, Van de Velde's club got tangled in the rough on his downswing, and his ball flew into the Barry Burn, a water hazard. He removed his shoes and socks and stepped through shin-deep water as he debated whether to try to hit his ball out of the Barry Burn, which guards the 18th green. Ultimately, he took a drop and then hit his fifth shot into the greenside bunker. Van de Velde shot to within six feet from the hole, and made the putt for a triple-bogey seven, dropping him into a three-way playoff with Justin Leonard and Paul Lawrie. Lawrie won in the playoff. The performance has become infamous in professional golf history. ESPN once called it the \"biggest collapse\" in golf, and in 2016 ranked it 13th on its list of 25 worst collapses in sports history. USA Today ranked it 4th in 2016 on its list of worst collapses in sports."

        "title": "Vladimir Kumarin_Biography",
        "content": "Kumarin was born in Tambov, after compulsory military service he came to Leningrad to study. In the 1980s he served his first sentence for possession of arms and forged documents. Thereafter he met a compatriot from Tambov, Valery Ledovskikh with whom he founded a gang. The gang initially invited only persons from Tambov region (thus its name - Tambovskaya). Being not yet strong enough to operate independently the gang merged into the large criminal group Velikolukskaya (from Velikie Luki, Pskov region) and was engaged mostly in commercial racket. In 1989 multiple Kumarin's gang members were convicted for the bloody firefight with another criminal gang, Malyshevskaya. The verdict was rather mild, supposedly because the state prosecutor was severely injured by the unknown persons during the investigation. After having completed a short sentence, Kumarin's gang has swiftly taken over racket all across the North-Western region of Russia - Leningrad, Pskov, Novgorod, Karelia - challenging the business affairs of his former 'host gang'. A bloody skirmish with Velikolukskaya gang caused Kumarin to fall into a month-long coma. His right arm had to be amputated at the shoulder and bullets pierced his stomach, chest and lungs. To this day he still has bullet fragments in his heart. During mid-1990-ties Kumarin attempted to legalize the criminal earnings of his gang using the extensive contacts with the government of St. Petersburg city headed by mayor Anatoly Sobchak (1991-1996), to whom the current Russian President Vladimir Putin served as assistant. Kumarin was an investor to the Kirishinefteorgsintez (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0444\u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0437) oil refinery and member of the Board of Petersburg Fuel Company (PTK) controlled by Kumarin. PTK became the sole supplier of gasoline to the municipal transport of St. Petersburg. Since late 1990-ties few senior members of Kumarin's structures as well as of its adversaries were killed and a row of investigations of his past criminal affairs was published. In June 2003, the magazine Der Spiegel mentioned that, according to the German ministry of criminal affairs, the German firm St. Petersburg Real Estate Holding Company () (SPAG) had fallen under suspicion of being involved in a money laundering scheme through the Cali cocaine cartel with connections to Kumarin. Russian co-owner of the SPAG's joint venture was the government of Saint-Petersburg and Vladimir Putin, then the municipal official, was a member of the board from 1992 to 2000. In April 2004 German police interrogated Kumarin but no indictments were made. It has been suggested that Kumarin maintained good relations to Russian politicians  Mikhail Glushenko and Alexander Filatov. Allegedly after refusing to back down from a business deal in favour of a politician close to Vladimir Putin, Kumarin was raided and arrested by 300 special forces officers on August 24, 2007. Prosecutor General Yury Chaika accused him of banditry and organizing a gang. He was also accused of the murder attempt on businessman Sergei Vasiliev, a rival in the oil business. In 2006, two men with automatic rifles sprayed Vasiliev's car with gunfire, wounding him and killing one of his bodyguards. Kumarin sought to clean up his image via donations to charities and the Russian Orthodox Church of which he was a devout follower as well as securing the release of two kidnapped children of Sergey Borodulin, Russian businessman. During this period his celebrity grew as well, dozens of celebrities and politicians attended his 50th birthday party in 2006. Kumarin was interviewed by Andrey Konstantinov, author of book Bandit Petersburg. Since 2004 Kumarin-Barsukov served as assistant to the St.Petersburg municipal MP, Alexander Nevzorov, well-known Russian journalist, who endorsed Kumarin as the \"perfectly clean person\" and invited Kumarin to play the role of King Louis XIV in his film. During the 1990-ties, however, Nevzorov covered multiple raids of Kumarin's gang in prime-time TV shows making the gang notorious among the public. After the 2007-2009 investigation Kumarin was sentenced to 14 years in prison plus a fine for the episodes of racket, fraud, money laundering and a murder attempt. The verdict was challenged in the European Court of Human Rights and by 2011 his sentence was reduced by 2.5 years. In 2012 another long investigation of Kumarin's affairs starts. Kumarin was accused of contracting a killing of Galina Starovoitova. Main witness against Kumarin was Mikhail Glushenko a.k.a. Misha-Khokhol, who in turn was in 2015 sentenced for 17 years in prison for arranging of the murder of Starovoitova. In March 2019, he was sentenced by the Court of St. Petersburg to 24 years in prison for creating The Tambov Gang."

Rossovich's next movie was Losin' It, a \"teenage romp down to Mexico... and [Rossovich] played a marine who the kids kept coming across, and which resulted in some high jinks.\" Losin' It was Tom Cruise's first lead role. Rossovich and Cruise, who Rossovich considers \"a great guy,\" first met on the set of Losin' It. The two would become friends, and go on to star together in Rossovich's biggest hit and one of Tom Cruise's most memorable works, Top Gun. On the set of Top Gun, Rossovich also \"really bonded with Val Kilmer,\" partly due to their respective roles in the movie and the relationship of their characters. Rossovich has stated that bonding with Kilmer came \"so naturally,\" and that he and Kilmer were \"kind of like brothers.\" In 1984, Rossovich was cast as Ginger's boyfriend Matt in The Terminator. Between The Terminator and Top Gun, Rossovich starred in Streets of Fire, where he plays Officer Cooley, and meets again with Bill Paxton; the sci-fi horror film Warning Sign, where he plays Bob; the action film Let's Get Harry, in which he plays Kurt Kleein; and the neo noir mystery film The Morning After, where he plays 'the Detective.'"

Rossovich starred in a number of minor movies in the early 90's, the most notable of which being the direct-to-video erotic thriller Cover Me, alongside Paul Sorvino, Elliott Gould and Corbin Bernsen. In the late 90's Rossovich landed a role on the long-running American medical drama television series E.R., playing Dr. John \"Tag\" Taglieri, Carol Hathaway's love interest in season one. The affair between Taglieri and Hathaway is one of main concerns of the first season of E.R.. From 1996 to 1998, Rossovich starred as the lead character in the crime drama series Pacific Blue. The series achieved some success in the U.S., and was run in many other countries; in some of these (such as Italy) the series is still being broadcast on national television to this day. In the late 90s, Rossovich starred in a few other movies, the most notable of which being Truth or Consequences, N.M. with Kiefer Sutherland and the 1998 romantic comedy Telling You, for which he made an uncredited cameo."

He then moved to Sweden, where he resides today. After giving up cinema and his  Hollywood life, Rossovich attempted a return to acting in 2012, with the comedy drama Sandbar. Rossovich doesn't appear to be contemplating to return to acting steadily, as in 2012 he stated \"I\u2019ve had a really great marriage and kids. I\u2019ve saved my money and invested. I can do what I want. I guess that\u2019s a blessing and a curse. It takes away some of your drive to go out and be a workaholic.\"Rossovich has appeared in over 30 films, including:"

        "content": "Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues (14 March 1909 \u2013 13 December 1991) was a French writer born in Paris. He became an associate of the Surrealists and married the Italian painter Bona Tibertelli de Pisis (a niece of the Italian metaphysical painter Count Filippo Tibertelli de Pisis).  He was a particularly close friend of the painter Leonor Fini. His novel La Marge (1967; Eng: The Margin) won the Prix Goncourt and was made into a film of the same name by Walerian Borowczyk in 1976. It is his collection of pornographic items that is featured in Borowczyk's Une collection particuliere. Borowczyk also used Mandiargues' work for the first story included in his anthology film Immoral Tales. He also wrote an introduction to Anne Desclos's Story of O and was a signatory to the Manifesto of the 121. His book Feu de braise (1959) was published in 1971 in an English translation by April FitzLyon called Blaze of Embers (Calder and Boyars, 1971). His most popular book was The Motorcycle (1963), which was adapted for the 1968 film The Girl on a Motorcycle, starring a young Marianne Faithfull. Mandiargues was friends with motorcycle journalist Anke-Eve Goldmann, who was likely the inspiration for the main character 'Rebecca', as Goldmann was the first woman to ride a motorcycle with a one-piece leather racing suit, which she designed with German manufacturer Harro."

Erhart, also wed his sister, Frances, becoming his brother-in-law. When Erhart died, in 1891, their partnership agreement came into effect, which stipulated that the surviving partner could buy the other's share of the company for half of its inventory value. Pfizer promptly exercised this option, paying his partner's heirs $119,350 for Erhart's half of the business. He remained as the head of the company for 51 years, until 1900, when it was incorporated. Charles Pfizer Jr. then became the company's first president; he was later succeeded by his brother, Emile."

He was born into a family of musicians and studied cello with Giovanni Perriera and composition with his father, Eliodoro Sollima, at the Conservatorio di Palermo, where he graduated with highest honors. He later studied with Antonio Janigro and Milko Kelemen at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart and at the Universit\u00e4t Mozarteum Salzburg. As a composer, Sollima's influences are wide ranging, taking in jazz and rock, as well as various ethnic traditions from the Mediterranean area. Sollima's music is influenced by minimalism, with his compositions often featuring modal melodies and repetitive structures. Because his works are characterized by a more diverse and eclectic approach to material than the early American minimalist composers, the American critic Kyle Gann has called Sollima a postminimalist composer. Sollima has collaborated with the American poet and musician Patti Smith, appearing on her records and performing with her in concert. He also collaborates with the Silk Road Project."

Timothy Radcliffe taught Holy Scripture at Oxford University at Blackfriars, and was elected provincial of England in 1988. In 1992 he was elected Master of the Dominican Order and held that office until 2001. During his tenure as Master, he was ex officio Grand Chancellor of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome. In 2001, after the expiration of his nine-year mandate as Master of the Dominican order, Timothy Radcliffe took a sabbatical year. Starting in 2002, he became again a simple member of the Dominican community of Oxford and carries out public speaking. Timothy Radcliffe occasionally presided at the Mass for gay people at Our Lady of the Assumption, Warwick Street, which Cardinal Murphy O'Connor, the Archbishop of Westminster, recognised as part of the Archdiocese's mission to gay people. In 2015 Radliffe was named a consultor to the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. This caused controversy due to statements he had made about the \"eucharistic\" dimension of homosexual sexual activity. The American television network EWTN dropped plans to cover an event in Ireland at which he was scheduled to speak because of Radcliffe's participation. A host at the station called Radcliffe's views \"at sharp variance to Catholic teaching.\u201d Radcliffe had written, \u201cCertainly [homosexual activity] can be generous, vulnerable, tender, mutual, and non-violent. So in many ways, I would think that it can be expressive of Christ's self-gift.\""

Probably Istv\u00e1nffy attributed this name to him after the good King Matija, and later the two, and the peasant king, Gy\u00f6rgy D\u00f3zsa (leader of the Hungarian peasant revolt in 1514), merged in folk traditions. Before the revolt, Gubec was a serf on the estate of the landowner Ferenc Tahy. When the revolt erupted, the peasants elected him to be one of the leaders, and renowned for his personal qualities, he became the most influential leader of the rebellion. During his brief tenure he showed ability as a capable administrator and inspiring leader that would later create a legend. He earned the nickname Gubec Beg. Matija Gubec led the poorly armed peasant army during its last stand at the Battle of Stubi\u010dko Polje on 9 February 1573 facing an army of the nobility led by bishop governor Juraj Dra\u0161kovi\u0107. Before the battle he made a speech trying to convince the men that only victory could bring them freedom, while the defeat would bring more misery. After the defeat he was captured and taken to Zagreb. On 15 February, under specific orders of bishop Dra\u0161kovi\u0107, he was publicly tortured and forced to wear a red-hot iron crown, cruelly dragged along the streets of the city, pinched with red-hot iron pincers, and was subsequently quartered."

During the Spanish Civil War, Yugoslav leftists who served in the pro-Republican International Brigades named their force the Grupo Matija Gubec.  During World War II, a Croatian and Slovenian brigade were named after him. He is also depicted as the protagonist of Gubec-beg (1975), the first Croatian rock opera. A museum of Croatian-Slovenian peasant revolt led by him is founded in Or\u0161i\u0107 Castle in Gornja Stubica, near the place of his last battle.

        "content": "Son of a tailor and builder, Eccles spent his childhood in the countryside of the parish of Saint Mary. Eccles had an itinerant childhood due to his father's need to travel Jamaica seeking work. He used to regularly attend church, and he became influenced by spiritual singing; In his words: \"One of my uncles was a spiritual revivalist, who always did this heavy type of spiritual singing, and I got to love that\". Eccles's professional singing career began as a teenager, working the north-coast hotel circuit in the mid-1950s.  In his late teens, he moved to Ocho Rios, where he performed at night in various shows, with artists such as The Blues Busters, Higgs & Wilson and Buster Brown. He moved to Kingston in 1959, where he started his recording career. He first recorded for Coxsone Dodd, who had organised a talent show in which Eccles took part. Eccles had a Jamaican hit in 1961 with the early ska song \"Freedom\", which was recorded in 1959, and was featured on Dodd's sound system for two years before it was released. It was one of the first Jamaican songs with socially oriented lyrics. The song discussed the concept of repatriation to Africa, an idea developed by the growing Rastafari movement. The song became the first Jamaican hit to be used for political purposes; Alexander Bustamante, founder of the Jamaican Labour Party and at that time Chief Minister of Jamaica adopted it for his fight against the Federation of the West Indies in 1960. In the following years, Eccles had other successful songs, mixing boogie/rhythm and blues influences with ska rhythms, such as \"River Jordan\" and \"Glory Hallelujah\". In 1962, he started promoting concerts and set up his Christmas Morning talent show; first with Dodd, then on his own. He organised concerts for The Clarendonians in 1963, and for The Wailers in 1964 and 1965. He launched other talent search contests, with Battle of the Stars, Clancy Eccles Revue, Independent Revue and Reggae Soul Revue, from which emerged stars such as Barrington Levy and Culture. Starting in 1963, he recorded with producers such as Charlie Moo (Leslie Kong's business partner) and the husband of Sonia Pottinger, Lyndon. He couldn't make a living from his music, so he quit in 1965 to work as a tailor in Annotto Bay. During this period, he made stage outfits for musicians such as Kes Chin, The Mighty Vikings, Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, Carlos Malcolm and The Blues Busters. He went back to music in 1967, producing his own recordings as well as those of other artists. He scored a hit with Eric 'Monty' Morris' reggae song \"Say What You're Saying\", and with his own song \"Feel The Rhythm\", one of several records that were instrumental in the shift from rocksteady to reggae. Eccles has also been credited with deriving the name 'reggae' from 'streggae', Kingston slang for a good-time girl. Eccles' first hit, \"What Will Your Mama Say\" which was released by the recently created United Kingdom label, Pama Records. In 1968, his song \"Fattie Fattie\" became a skinhead reggae classic, along with his productions of recordings by the toasting DJ King Stitt (\"Fire Corner\", \"Van Cleef\", \"Herbman Shuffle\"). Eccles recorded many organ-led instrumentals with his session band The Dynamites (same band has Derrick Harriott's ), featuring Jackie Jackson, Hux Brown, Paul Douglas, Winston Wright, Gladstone Anderson, Winston Grennan, Joe Isaacs, and Hugh Malcolm, with Johnny Moore and Bobby Ellis both contributing trumpet in different sessions. In 1970, Eccles helped pave the way to the dub music genre by releasing an instrumental version of \"Herbman Shuffle\" called \"Phantom\", with a mix focusing on the bass line. Eccles launched different record labels for his works: Clansone, New Beat and Clandisc (the latter also the name of a sub-label set up by Trojan Records for Eccles' UK releases). He recorded artists such as Alton Ellis, Joe Higgs, the Trinidian Lord Creator (\"Kingston Town\"), Larry Marshall, Hemsley Morris, Earl Lawrence, The Beltones, Glen Ricks, Cynthia Richards, Buster Brown and Beres Hammond. Appreciated by musicians for his fairness and sense of equity, he helped Lee Perry set up his Upsetter record label in 1968 after Perry left Dodd's employment, and helped Winston 'Niney' Holmes (later known as 'The Observer') record his first hit as a producer in 1971 (\"Blood & Fire\"). A socialist militant, Eccles was appointed as an adviser on the music industry to Michael Manley's People's National Party (PNP) and took part in Jamaica's 1972 prime ministerial elections by organising a \"Bandwagon\" featuring musicians such as Bob Marley & the Wailers, Dennis Brown, Max Romeo, Delroy Wilson and Inner Circle, performing around the island in support of Manley's campaign. Throughout the 1970s, he remained close to Manley and wrote several songs in praise of the PNP program, including his hits \"Power for the People\", \"Rod of Correction\" or \"Generation Belly\". Eccles' political interests meant that he spent less time on music, although in the late 1970s, Eccles had further success as a producer with recordings by Tito Simon and Exuma the Obeah Man, as well as collaborations with King Tubby. After the 1970s, new Eccles recordings were rare, and he concentrated on live concert promotion and re-issues of his back catalogue. In the 1980s, Eccles slowed down his musical activities, and he never met success again, apart from a few political songs, such as \"Dem Mash Up The Country\" in 1985. Eccles died on 30 June 2005, in Spanish Town Hospital from complications of a heart attack. Eccles' son, Clancy Eccles Jr., has followed his father into the music business, initially performing as simply \"Clancy\"."

Lloyd Barnes worked for Duke Reid's Treasure Isle label as an engineer before emigrating to The Bronx, New York, in the early 1970s. Here he founded the Wackie's House Of Music record store, and behind this shop-front was the first significant reggae studio and label in the United States. The Bullwackie's and Wackies labels followed, along with other imprints such as Senrab, Hamma, and Senta. Barnes also recorded the group Aksumites, including recordings by Andrew McCalla and Joe Aksumite, two of the group members who have recorded with him since the inception of Wackie's House of Music, and during the late 1970s and early 1980s he produced artists such as Horace Andy, Sugar Minott, Junior Byles, Roland Alphonso, Tyrone Evans, and Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. Later productions included work by Jackie Mittoo. Barnes also operated a sound system, which he used as an outlet for the Wackies recordings. Barnes presently resides in the Wakefield neighborhood in the New York City borough of the Bronx, where he owns and operates a music studio."

In 1834, he became an assistant to Dr. Charles Hodge, professor of oriental and biblical literature in the Princeton Theological Seminary, and in 1838, he became associate professor of oriental and biblical literature there, succeeding Dr. Hodge in that chair in 1840 and being transferred in 1851 to the chair of biblical and ecclesiastical history, and in 1859 to that of Hellenistic and New Testament literature, which he occupied until his death at Princeton on January 28, 1860. Alexander was distinguished in Oriental scholarship as well as in biblical learning, and was a thorough master of the modern European languages. He had been ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1839, and was well known for his pulpit eloquence. He was the author of The Earlier Prophecies of Isaiah (1846), The Later Prophecies of Isaiah (1847), and an abbreviation of these two volumes, Isaiah Illustrated and Explained (2 vols., 1851), The Psalms Translated and Explained (3 vols., 1850), Commentary on Acts (2 vols., 1857) and Commentary on Mark (1858). After his death there appeared his two volumes of Sermons (1860), Commentary on Matthew (1861) and Notes on New Testament Literature (1861). Henry Carrington Alexander prepared a biography first published in 1869. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1845."

Trained at the \u00c9cole des Chartes and the \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes, he made his first appearance in the world of scholarship as the author of an excellent book called \u00c9tudes sur l'industrie et la classe industrielle \u00e0 Paris au XIIIe et au XIVe si\u00e8cle (1877). This work, composed almost entirely from documents, many unpublished, opened a new field for historical study. Twenty years later he supplemented this book by an interesting collection of Documents relatifs \u00e0 l'histoire de l'industrie et du commerce en France (2 vols., 1898-1900), and in 1897 he published L'\u00e9conomie sociale de la France sous Henri IV, a volume containing the results of very minute research. He did not, however, confine himself to economic history. His Le P\u00e8re Joseph et Richelieu (1894), though somewhat frigid and severe, is based on a mass of unpublished information, and shows remarkable psychologic grasp. In 1878 his Journal parisien de Jean de Maupoint, prieur de Sainte-Catherine-de-la-Couture was published in vol. iv. of the M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Histoire de Paris et de l'\u00cele de France. He wrote numerous articles in the Revue historique (of which he was co-director with Gabriel Monod for some years) and in other learned reviews, such as the Revue des questions historiques and the Journal des savants.

        "content": "As a young man, Sacchi had worked under Cortona at the Villa Sacchetti at Castelfusano (1627\u20131629). But in a set of public debates at the Accademia di San Luca, the guild for artists in Rome, he strongly criticized Cortona's exuberance. The debate is significant because it indicates how two of the leading proponents of the prevailing styles in painting, now called 'Classical' and 'Baroque', discussed the differences between their work. In particular, Sacchi advocated that since a unique, individual expression, gesture and movement needed to be assigned to each figure in a composition, so a painting should only have a few figures. In a crowded composition, the figures would be deprived of individuality, and thus cloud the particular meaning of the piece. In some ways this was a reaction against the zealous excess of crowds in paintings by artists such as Zuccari in the previous generation, and by Cortona among his contemporaries. Simplicity and unity were essential to Sacchi who, drawing an analogy to poetry, likened painting to tragedy. In his counter-argument, Cortona made the case that large paintings with many figures were like an epic which could develop multiple sub-themes. But for Sacchi, the encrustation of a painting with excess decorative details, including melees of crowds, would represent something akin to 'wall-paper' art rather than focused narrative. Among the partisans of Sacchi's argument for simplicity and focus were his friends, the sculptor Algardi and painter Poussin. The controversy was however less pitched and monolithic than some might suggest. In fact, Poussin's biographer Bellori recounts that the artist 'used to laugh at those who contract for a [history painting] with six or eight figures or some other fixed number.' Sacchi and Albani, among others, shared dissatisfaction with the artistic depiction of low or genre subjects and themes, such as those preferred by the Bamboccianti and even the Caravaggisti. They felt that high art should focus on exalted themes- biblical, mythological, or from classical ancient history. Sacchi, who worked almost always in Rome, left few pictures visible in private galleries. He had a flourishing school: Carlo Maratta was a younger collaborator or pupil. In Maratta's large studio, Sacchi's preference for a grand manner style would find pre-eminence among Roman circles for decades to follow. But many others worked under him or his influence including Francesco Fiorelli, Luigi Garzi, Francesco Lauri, Andrea Camassei, and Giacinto Gimignani. Sacchi's own illegitimate son Giuseppe, died young after high hopes for his future. Sacchi died at Nettuno in 1661."

The canvas portrays the legend that the Empress Constantia had begged Pope Gregory I to give her relics of the body of Saints Peter and Paul, but the pope, not daring to disturb the remains of these saints, sent her a fragment of the linen which had enveloped the remains of Saint John the Evangelist. Constantia rejected this gift from the pope as insufficient. Then Gregory, to prove the power of relics to work miracles (and justify their worth), placed the cloth on the altar, and, after praying, pierced it with a knife, and blood flowed from it as from a living body. In 1771, a mosaic copy of this painting was made for the Basilica of  St Peter's. This painting echoes positions stated in the canons of  the Council of Trent: wherein relics had an important role in miracles, the pope served as the final interpreter of sanctity, and finally it was a metaphor of the validity of the eucharist as the true body of Christ."

In 1994 Avellanet went to college in Puerto Rico to study Advertising. In 1996 tropical music producer and business executive, Ralph Mercado, signed Robert to record a Salsa album under the RMM label. The album Sentir (1999), produced by master Isidro Infante, had success in several Latin American countries, and in New York and Puerto Rico. The album was promoted by its lead single, \"Miente\", a cover of Enrique Iglesias's song which became a top-ten hit on the Billboard Tropical Airplay chart. In 2002 he moved to Miami to write & produce his new album as a solo artist. He\u2019s become a well known soap opera actor, as well, working for networks such as Univision, Telemundo and Venevision Productions. Avellanet has also been in several theatrical plays.

There he received his first drawing lessons from his father, , who taught drawing at the university in Heidelberg. He formed himself chiefly through the study of nature and of great masterworks. In his first artistic period, he painted atmospheric phenomena. After gaining prominence with Heidelberg at Sunset (a water color), and Castle Eltz, he settled in Munich in 1822 and devoted himself to Bavarian scenery. Here his second period began, and in 1824 he married Friedericke, the daughter of his uncle, Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell, who served as an attendant at court. Through this connection, he made the acquaintance of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who in 1826/27 sponsored his travels in Italy in order to widen his repertoire, which up to that point consisted solely of domestic, German, landscapes. In Italy, Rottmann made sketches for the 28 Italian landscapes in fresco which he was commissioned to paint in the arcades of the Hofgarten at Munich. The cycle, completed in 1833, gave visual expression to Ludwig's alliance with Italy, and raised the genre of landscape painting to the height of history painting, the preferred mode of the King's other great commissions for monumental painting. The frescos unfortunately deteriorated under climatic influences. The cartoons for them are in the Darmstadt Gallery. In 1834 Rottmann traveled to Greece to prepare for a commission from Ludwig for a second cycle; one might mark here the beginning of his third period. At first also intended for the Hofgarten arcade, the 23 great landscapes were eventually installed in the newly built Neue Pinakothek where they were given their own hall. Of his easel pictures, Ammer Lake and Marathon are in the National Gallery, Berlin; The Acropolis of Sikyon and Corfu in the Pinakothek, Munich; others in the Schack Gallery, Munich, and in Karlsruhe; and seven in the Leipzig Museum. Carl Rottmann died on 7 July 1850 in Munich, aged 53 of undisclosed causes. He is buried in the Alter S\u00fcdfriedhof in Munich."

His late uncle Thomas Bullitt, after leading the Virginia militia westward in Dunmore's War, had returned to the  Falls of the Ohio and surveyed a town site in 1773. In 1800 the Virginia legislature incorporated the new town and named it Louisville. Alexander bought 1000 acres (4\u00a0km2) about 9 miles (14\u00a0km) south of Louisville and began clearing another farm. He named the plantation Oxmoor, after the fictional farm in Tristram Shandy. In August 1785, his neighbor, Colonel William Christian, who had represented Fincastle County, Virginia during the American Revolutionary War and was now developing a neighboring Jefferson County property, brought his wife and family from Virginia. Two months later Alexander married their young daughter Priscilla, and thus also improved his political connections (her uncle was Patrick Henry). They built Oxmoor Farm, starting the main house in 1787, and growing tobacco, hemp, and corn. In 1789, Bullitt owned twenty-three enslaved people at Oxmoor. By 1795, that number had grown to seventy."

He became an officer in the local militia, and met with others at Danville in a convention that first proposed a separation from Virginia. After  Colonel Christian died in a skirmish with Indians in 1786, Bullitt continued with the local militia and was promoted to the rank of major. He also became a trustee of the town of Louisville. In 1792 when the idea of Kentucky statehood was accepted, Bullitt became a delegate to the Convention (again in Danville) and sat the committee that drafted the first state Constitution. With the new constitution in place, in June he was one of twelve men elected to the State Senate. He was elected its speaker, and served there until 1800. When a second state constitution was sought, in 1799, Bullitt presided at the convention that wrote it. This new constitution created the office of Lieutenant Governor and he was elected to that office in 1800 serving under Governor James Garrard. In 1804 or 1808  Bullitt returned to private life and full-time farming at Oxmoor."

This film was different from other films of that period in that it presents certain emotions and sympathies towards the relationship between Mainland China and Hong Kong (the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed the same year Homecoming was released). The film brings together two very well known actresses, Josephine Koo and Siqin Gaowa. Anita Mui's theme song with the same title as the film has also been a popular cantopop song.

When netminder Pasi H\u00e4kkinen left for Denmark after the 2004\u20132005 season, Hallikainen became the Jokerit #2 goalie in the SM-liiga. With Tim Thomas surprisingly abandoning the team just one day before the regular season opened, Hallikainen had to take on his job with only a day's warning in the first game of the season, a local game versus HIFK, with 10,000 fans in attendance. Hallikainen played an excellent game, which Jokerit won in a shootout after overtime. When netminder Karl Goehring was hurriedly hired to replace Thomas, Hallikainen returned to backup goaltender, and with the arrival of Mikko R\u00e4m\u00f6, to games with the Jokerit junior team. In season 2006/07 Jokerit signed goaltender Juuso Riksman as its number 1, with Hallikainen fighting out the back up spot with youngster Niko Hovinen. When Riksman was sidelined with a long-term back injury, Jokerit quickly replaced him with Andy Chiodo, only for him to pick up an injury almost immediately. Jokerit then signed Finnish netminder Ari Ahonen for the number one spot, with Hallikainen backing him up. When Ahonen was in turn injured, Hallikainen made his season debut in Oulu against K\u00e4rp\u00e4t, then leading the league, making 44 saves and allowing only one goal. He followed this up the next day by posting his first career shutout against Ilves.

        "content": "Lorenzo Ignatius \"Lory\" Meagher (25 May 1899 \u2013 17 May 1973) was an Irish hurler who played as a midfielder for the Kilkenny senior team. Born in Tullaroan, County Kilkenny, Meagher arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-four when he first linked up with the Kilkenny senior team. He made his debut in the 1924 championship. Meagher went on to play a key part for more than a decade, and won three All-Ireland medals, eight Leinster medals and one National Hurling League medal. An All-Ireland runner-up on four occasions, Meagher also captained the team to All-Ireland victory in 1935. Meagher represented the Leinster inter-provincial team at various times throughout his career, winning two Railway Cup medals in 1927 and 1933. At club level, he won five championship medals with Tullaroan. Throughout his career, Meagher made 39 championship appearances for Kilkenny. His retirement came following Kilkenny's defeat by Tipperary in the 1937 championship. His brothers, Frank, Willie and Henry, all played with distinction with Kilkenny. Meagher has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of hurling's greatest players, including as midfield partner to Jack Lynch on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984 and the Hurling Team of the Millennium in 2000."

        "content": "Meagher played his club hurling with Tullaroan and enjoyed much success during a lengthy career. He made his club debut in 1919, in what was the delayed ending of the 1916 championship. The delay, a direct consequence of a period of political instability in Ireland, eventually led to the suspension of the championship for a number of years. Tullaroan contested that year's final, with Meagher lining out at midfield, however, a 5\u20132 to 2\u20133 score line after an earlier drawn game resulted in victory for Mooncoin. By 1924, the championship had resumed on a regular basis and Tullaroan contested the decider once again. A comprehensive 4\u20134 to 2\u20132 defeat of Clonmanto gave Meagher his first championship medal. Tullaroan and Meagher made it two-in-a-row in 1925, following a narrow 3\u20134 to 3\u20133 defeat of Dicksboro. A period of decline followed, however, Tullaroan fought back to reach the championship decider once again in 1930. A 4\u20134 to 0\u20133 trouncing of senior hurling novices Urlingford gave Meagher a third championship medal. Tullaroan surrendered their championship crown the following year, but returned to the decider again in 1933. A high-scoring 6\u20135 to 5\u20134 defeat of Carrickshock gave Meagher, who by now was captain of the team, a fourth championship medal. Carrickshock stood in the way of a second successive championship for Tullaroan in 1934, however, they proved no match. A 6\u20136 to 1\u20135 victory gave Meagher his fifth and final championship medal and his second victory as captain. Meagher's club career ended in much the same way in which it started, as a narrow 4\u20132 to 4\u20131 defeat by Mooncoin in the 1936 decider proved to be his final big outing with Tullaroan."

        "content": "Meagher made his senior inter-county debut for Kilkenny in a 1\u20133 to 3\u20134 Leinster semi-final defeat by Dublin in 1924. In 1925, Meagher lined out in his first provincial decider. Reigning champions Dublin provided the opposition and secured a 6\u20134 to 4\u20137 victory. A subsequent objection forced the result to be overturned, and Meagher collected his first Leinster medal as Kilkenny were awarded the title. Meagher won a second Leinster medal, his first on the field of play, in 1926 as Offaly were accounted for by 3\u20138 to 1\u20134. On 24 October 1926, he lined out in his first All-Ireland decider, with his two brothers, Willie and Henry, also on the Kilkenny team to face Cork. At a snow-covered Croke Park, the first half was even enough with Cork holding an interval lead of one point, however, Kilkenny slumped in the second half, going down to a 4\u20136 to 2\u20130 defeat. After tamely surrendering their Leinster crown to Dublin the following year, both sides met again in the provincial decider in 1929. Controversy and dissent dogged the game as the players from the Dicksboro club did not play as they disagreed with the selection committee's choice. The dispute caused a delay in taking the field. Kilkenny won the game by 3\u20135 to 2\u20136; however, Dublin objected on the grounds that Kilkenny were late taking the field. The referee reported that they were seventeen minutes late, but Dublin were also late. The final was declared null and void. After a shock defeat by Laois in 1931, both sides met in the provincial decider the following year. A 4\u20137 to 4\u20132 victory gave Meagher his third Leinster medal. 6 September 1931 saw Kilkenny face Cork in the All-Ireland final for the first time in five years. The first half was closely contested, with a goal from Mick Ahern helping Cork to a half-time lead of 1\u20133 to 0\u20132. Cork stretched the advantage to six points in the second half, but Kilkenny came storming back with a goal and then four points on the trot to take the lead by one point. In the dying moments, Eudie Coughlan got possession and made his way towards the goal. As he did so he slipped and fell but struck the sliotar while he was down on his knees, and it went over the bar for the equalising point. A 1\u20136 apiece draw was the result. 11 October 1931 was the date of the replay and proved to be just as exciting a contest as the first game. Meagher was playing the best hurling of his career at this time and scored a magnificent point from 90 yards out the field. In spite of this great effort a winner couldn't be found and both sides finished level again at 2\u20135 apiece. After this game, officials pressed for extra time; however, Cork captain Eudie Coughlan rejected this. It was also suggested at a meeting of Council that both teams be declared joint champions and that half an All-Ireland medal by given to each player. This motion was later defeated. As the All-Ireland saga went to a third meeting on 1 November 1931, Meagher was ruled out of the game because of broken ribs sustained in the first replay. Such was the esteem in which he was held, the game was virtually conceded to Cork since the star captain couldn't play. In spite of fielding a younger team, Kilkenny were defeated by Cork on a score line of 5\u20138 to 3\u20134. Kilkenny retained their provincial crown in 1932, with Meagher adding a fourth Leinster medal to his collection following a 4\u20136 to 3\u20135 defeat of Dublin. The All-Ireland final on 4 September 1932 saw Clare provide the opposition for the first time in almost twenty years. In a low-scoring game, Clare's Tull Considine scored two goals and was foiled for what would almost certainly have been a third. These goals were negated by Kilkenny's three goal-scoring heroes Matty Power, Martin White and Meagher, who scored a remarkable goal from a line ball. The final score of 3\u20133 to 2\u20133 gave victory to Kilkenny and gave Meagher an All-Ireland medal. 1933 saw Meagher add a National Hurling League medal to his collection following a 3\u20138 to 1\u20133 defeat of Limerick. He later won a fifth Leinster medal following a stunning comeback against Dublin in which he scored a decisive goal in a 7\u20135 to 2\u20135 victory. The All-Ireland final on 3 September 1933 saw a record crowd of 45,176 travel to Croke Park to see Kilkenny face and up-and-coming Limerick. After being level at the interval, the game remained close in the second half until a solo-run goal by Johnny Dunne sealed a 1\u20137 to 0\u20136 victory. It was Meagher's second consecutive All-Ireland medal. After surrendering their provincial crown to Dublin in 1934, Kilkenny faced Laois in the decider again the following year. A 3\u20138 to 0\u20136 victory gave Meagher, who was now captain of the team, a sixth Leinster medal. Another record crowd gathered at Croke Park for the All-Ireland final between Kilkenny and Limerick on 1 September 1935. In spite of rain falling throughout the entire game, both sides served up a classic. At the beginning of the second-half, Meagher sent over a huge point from midfield giving Kilkenny a lead which they wouldn't surrender. A narrow 2\u20135 to 2\u20134 victory gave Meagher a third All-Ireland medal, while he also had the honour of collecting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. Kilkenny dominated the provincial series again in 1936 and Meagher won his seventh Leinster medal following a 4\u20136 to 2\u20135 defeat of Laois. The lure of a Kilkenny-Limerick clash brought a record crowd of over 50,000 to Croke Park for the All-Ireland decider on 6 September 1936. The first half produced a game that lived up to the previous clashes, and Limerick had a two-point advantage at half-time. In the second half Limerick took over and Meagher's side were completely outclassed on a 5\u20136 to 1\u20135 score line. Meagher's influence on the Kilkenny team had been in decline for a number of seasons, however, he was still chosen for the opening provincial games in 1937. A 5\u20133 to 2\u20134 defeat of provincial final debutantes game him his eighth Leinster medal. For the first time in his career, Meagher was dropped from the starting fifteen for the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final defeat of Galway. The All-Ireland final against Tipperary took place at Fitzgerald Stadium, Killarney on 5 September 1937, however, Meagher was among the substitutes. He was introduced in the second half, however. Tipp gave a tour de force performance and recorded a 3\u201311 to 0\u20133 victory in one of the most one-sided championship deciders ever. This was Meagher's last game in the black and amber jersey of Kilkenny."

While attending the inaugural Railway Cup semi-final between Connacht and Leinster at O'Moore Park as a spectator, one of the players on the team cried off to make way for Meagher. His performance was so good that he was retained for the decider against Munster. A 1\u201311 to 2\u20136 victory gave Meagher his first Railway Cup medal. After a period of Munster dominance, Leinster reclaimed the title in 1933. The 4\u20136 to 3\u20136 victory gave Meagher a second Railway Cup medal."

        "content": "In time, Meagher came to be regarded as one of the greatest players of all-time. Moondharrig, a contemporary hurling commentator, said of him: \"Meagher was the stylist of the hurling fields, not alone in the hey-day of his career, the late '20s and early '30s, but possibly in our life-times. Certainly no sweeter striker of the ball has graced the senior championship for Meagher was equally effective off the ground or in the air, from play or from the side-placed ball.\". In his book, A Lifetime in Hurling, contemporary Tipperary hurler Tommy Doyle, wrote: \"Lory Meagher was one of the greatest hurlers Kilkenny ever produced. When the occasion demanded few hurlers could rise to the same brilliancy as the Tullaroan captain, and for a period of ten years or so he inspired his county to many notable triumphs.\" Following his death in 1973, prominent Gaelic games sportswriter, P\u00e1draig Puirs\u00e9il, wrote: \"I have not seen the equal of his artistry, or watched a more supreme stylist. When the mood was on him Meagher was a veritable magician, with a cam\u00e1n for a wand; he was a wizard with the sliotar at his command.\" At his funeral, his coffin was carried from the altar to the waiting hearse by former Cork legends Jack Barrett, Eudie Coughlan, Paddy \"Fox\" Collins and Jim O'Regan. These men had played against Meagher in the epic three-game All-Ireland saga in 1931. A decade after his death, Meagher received the ultimate honour during the GAA's centenary year in 1984 when he was chosen at midfield on the Hurling Team of the Century. In 1988, he was chosen on a special Tullaroan team to celebrate the centenary of the club's foundation. Meagher later retained his position at midfield on the Hurling Team of the Millennium in 2000, while he was also named in the same position on a special Kilkenny Team of the Century. In 2008, Meagher's name was further honoured when the Lory Meagher Cup was introduced for \"fourth tier\" teams."

The name Lorenzo had been in the family for generations and one of his grand uncles, named Lorenzo, had been a naval doctor. Meagher was born into a family that was heavily involved in nationalist politics and in Gaelic games. His father, Henry Joseph Meagher (born 1865), is believed to have attended the very first meeting of the Gaelic Athletic Association in Thurles in 1884. His mother, Elizabeth Keoghan (born 1866), from Threecastles, was an aunt of the famous Grace family, which was to garner fifteen All-Ireland medals in all. A cousin was Jack Keoghan, who won five All-Ireland medals. Jer Doheny, who captained Kilkenny's first All-Ireland winning team, was also a cousin. The Meaghers were substantial farmers, farming about 130 acres of good land. Meagher was the third child in the family. His siblings included Willie (1895\u20131957), Kathleen (born 1896), Frank (1897\u20131971), Elizabeth (1898\u20131987), Mary Agnes (1901\u20131978), Henry (1902\u20131982) and Rose Angela (1906\u20131984). After his education at the local national school, Meagher spent the rest of his life working as a farmer and never married."

He joined the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts in 1798 under Cajetan Toscani and J\u00f3zef Grassi, later working autodidactically, copying the famous pictures of the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, among them a copy of the Sixtinian Madonna. He was made a member of the Academy in 1817 and professor in 1824. The Cotta publishing house commissioned illustrations for Johann Wolfgang Goethe's Faust (26 plates), which made him financially independent. Goethe liked his work, and he illustrated works by other famous authors, most notably Friedrich Schiller's Lied von der Glocke (43 plates), a Shakespeare Gallery (80 plates), and B\u00fcrger's Ballads (15 plates).  He also did oil paintings on classical subjects, and portraits. Many of his works were created in a house in the L\u00f6\u00dfnitz, with a view of the Elbe Valley. As a winemaker, he was a member of the Saxon wine association from 1799 onwards. Retzsch died in Oberl\u00f6ssnitz/Radebeul."

Stasov became a prominent figure in mid-19th-century Russian culture. He discovered a large number of its greatest talents, inspired many of their works and fought their battles in numerous articles and letters to the press. As such, he carried on a lifelong debate with Russian novelist and playwright Ivan Turgenev, who considered Stasov \"our great all-Russian critic.\" He wanted Russian art to liberate itself from what he saw as Europe's hold.  By copying the west, he felt, Russian artists could be, at best, second-rate.  However, by borrowing from their own native traditions, they might create a truly national art that could match Europe's with its high artistic standards and originality. By \"national\" Stasov meant an art that would not only portray people's lives but also be meaningful to them and show them how to live."

In the years which followed he served as an elder adviser to the group of Russian composers known as \"The Five\". He also warmed to Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky after hearing the composer play the finale of his Little Russian Symphony at a Christmas 1872 gathering at Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's home.  Shortly after this gathering, Stasov prompted Tchaikovsky to write a piece based on Shakespeare's The Tempest.  He also drafted a program, initially for Hector Berlioz, that Tchaikovsky eventually used for his Manfred Symphony.  In between those two works, Stasov suggested an opera based on Alfred de Vigny's historical romance Cinq-Mars.  Tchaikovsky was then intent on writing Eugene Onegin, and Charles Gounod had already written an opera based on Cinq-Mars."

        "content": "When artists did not follow his precepts, Stasov could become both intolerant and vocal. Stasov called the finale of Tchaikovsky's Little Russian symphony \"one of the most important creations of the whole Russian school.\"  Otherwise, his overall verdict on Tchaikovsky's work was negative: \"The Conservatoire, academic training, eclecticism and overworking of musical materials laid its dread, destructive hand on him.  Of his total output, a few works [Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, Francesca da Rimini, and the String Quartets 2 and 3] are first-rate and highly original; the remainder are mediocre or weak.\" Nor was he consoling about Modest Mussorgsky, a composer who, as a member of \"The Five,\" he had helped nurture but about whom, for all the public praise of his musical gifts, there was always a note of intellectual condescension.  Founder Mily Balakirev confided to Stasov that he thought Mussorgsky \"almost an idiot.\"  Stasov replied, \"I think he is a total idiot.\"  But this exchange reportedly occurred before Mussorgsky wrote his greatest songs and any of his operas, starting in the 1860s. He was harsher still with the modernist art magazine Mir iskusstva and its founders, Alexandre Benois, L\u00e9on Bakst and Sergei Diaghilev when the magazine appeared in 1898.  He called Diaghilev \"a decadent cheerleader\" in print and Mir iskusstva \"the courtyard of the lepers\" (an image borrowed from Victor Hugo's novel Notre-Dame de Paris). Stasov's correspondence with leading personalities of Russian art life is invaluable.  He is known also for his opposition to music critic and erstwhile friend Alexander Serov regarding the relative merits of Glinka's two operas. He was so impressed by the literary talent of the Jewish schoolboy Samuil Marshak that he arranged an exception from the Pale of Settlement laws for him and his family. Stasov's brother, Dmitry Stasov (1828\u20131918), was a notable advocate who took part in the foundation of the Russian Music Society. His niece, Elena Stasova (1873\u20131966), was a prominent Marxist revolutionary and functionary in the Soviet government."

        "content": "Shortly thereafter, Cann contacted John Foxx, who invited Cann to join his fledgling band Tiger Lily with bassist Chris Cross and guitarist Stevie Shears. The band recorded sole single \"Ain't Misbehavin'\", which was released in 1975 and used as a main theme to the namesake softcore porno movie. In 1976, Tiger Lily changed its name to Ultravox!, and later in 1978 to Ultravox. Cann played on the first albums released by Island Records, Ultravox! (1977), Ha! Ha! Ha! (both 1977) and Systems of Romance (1978). After a tour of United States and Canada the band fragmented because of the departure of vocalist John Foxx and guitarist Robin Simon. Ultravox replaced them with singer/guitarist Midge Ure in Summer 1979. Ure-led Ultravox signed to Chrysalis in 1980 and went on to have a commercial success worldwide. Cann contributed lyrics to 2/3 of the first Ure-led album \"Vienna\", sang backing vocals, co-lead and lead on some Ultravox songs: \"Mr. X\" (1980), \"Paths and Angles\" (1981), \"We Came to Dance\" (1982) and \"Break Your Back\" (1983). He remained active outside the band during Ultravox success. In 1982 he played acoustic and electronic percussion for Zaine Griff (album \"Figvres\") and Peter Godwin (single \"Images of Heaven\"). He and Hans Zimmer were a part of the backing band for a New Romantic singer Ronny on her London show in The Dominion. Ronny also participated in the Helden project, formed by Cann and Zimmer that year, which merged electronic, orchestral and classical influences. Helden were the first music project to play The London Planetarium in March 1983. They released a single \"Holding on\" (1983) and recorded an album called \"Spies\" which featured many guests (Zaine Griff, Eddie Maelov from Eddie & Sunshine, Brian Robertson from Thin Lizzy etc.). It remains unreleased. In September 1984 Cann and Zimmer performed as guests (on drums and keyboards, respectively) on a concert by the Spanish band Mecano. Two songs from that show were released in 1985 on LP \"En Concierto\". Also in 1985 Cann produced a single for the eccentric singer Duffo, \"Gonna Send the Boys Around\", and took part in the Doctor Who charity single \"Doctor in Distress\". Cann was ousted from the band in 1986, after disagreements arose with other band members who started to consider him a problem for the progress of the band.  Cann wanted a fully programmed percussion sound while the others preferred a \"back-to-basics\" approach. In his autobiography, Midge Ure later commented that in retrospect he considered the firing unjust, unwarranted, and a result of misplaced tensions., describing Cann's dismissal as \"cutting the band's jugular vein\". Following his departure from Ultravox Cann recorded a solo demo which was turned down by Chrysalis Records. He did session work for other artists, including 7000 Danses by  Indochine, appeared on several television shows with Kim Wilde and produced demos for aspiring bands. He joined a band called The Sons of Valentino, and then played guitar and keyboards with The Huw Lloyd-Langton Group. He later moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the movie business. He was an actor in the Hollywood Horror-movie, \"The American Scream\" (1988), and made the music to \"Deadly Currency\" (1998), as well as writing for music technology magazines such as Sound On Sound. While his adventures in Los Angeles were undeniably interesting and occasionally exciting, he decided to walk away from the music and entertainment businesses. Cann rejoined Ultravox over two decades later in 2008, which reunited the classic lineup last seen at Live Aid in 1985. In April 2009 the band toured with \"Return to Eden\". In May 2012 the first studio album in 28 years by this lineup was released with the title Brilliant."

        "title": "Warren Cann_Technical innovations",
        "content": "Cann and his technicians were among the first to modify commercially available rhythm units or drum machines, so they could alter and override the preset manufacturer programs.  This is notable on \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\", from the album Ha!-Ha!-Ha!. When Ultravox were recording Vienna, Cann's electronic ventures would become important for the Ultravox sound. The acquisition of a Roland CR-78 proved something of a headache for Cann, as he saw great sonic potential in it, but it had limited pattern programmability. In the process of adding some much needed practical customisations to the CR-78, Cann became somewhat persona non grata at the Roland headquarters in the UK. This did not stop Cann from carrying out his plans, and the result proved to be a key factor in the overall sound of their signature hit song \"Vienna\". The initial reaction to the usage of drum machines led to bewilderment among the audience, who wondered what Cann was doing during some songs. Among claims that he was doing nothing, he decided to equip his drum machines with clear perspex cases instead of wood panels, and mount a variety of LEDs inside them as a feature Cann himself described as \"absolutely useless, but very impressive looking on a darkened stage; now it would be obvious I was actually doing something.\" (From Jonas W\u00e5rstad's interview at Discog) In addition to his drum machine work, Cann designed several modifications for bass player Chris Cross' Minimoog, among them a primitive sequencer (built by Roy Gwinn) made from a series of toggle switches to add syncopation to the synthesiser's ability to create a stream of eighth notes, and a proprietary triggering system that allowed Cann and Cross to synchronise the Minimoog with Cann's drum machines, a feat performed almost three years before MIDI was officially introduced in 1983.  According to Midge Ure's autobiography, when the Minimoog broke down on tour, Ultravox borrowed one from The Cars, but it didn't help as it lacked the proprietary modifications."

        "title": "Warren Cann_Playing style",
        "content": "In the spring of 1978, when Ultravox released the Systems of Romance album, Cann's style of drumming turned away from its rock roots and toward what was becoming the New Wave sound. He endeavoured to have extremely precise timing; this would make the songs with live drums match songs driven by electronic, programmed percussion. For an example of this, compare the song \"Sleepwalk\", where Cann plays live drums, to \"Mr. X\", where the drums are sequenced. Both of these tracks can be found on Vienna. Despite his machine-like timing, Cann would often do things that neither drum machines nor electronically sequenced percussion could do at the time.  Specifically, he would often play very precise triplet fills and crescendos, especially on the snare drum. While these two techniques are easily accomplished by electronic instruments today, around 1979\u20131982 they were virtually impossible. In essence, it could fool the listeners to believe they were hearing a drum machine, only to prove them wrong through out-performing the rather rudimentary sequencing possibilities of the time. From a technical perspective, Cann preferred a traditional grip. On the Quartet album and subsequent tour (1982), Cann employed several sets of Simmons SDS-V electronic percussion pads, even to the point where he had an extra kit consisting of the hexagonal Simmons pads, which he played standing up. This way of playing was relatively unique and Cann seemed to be using this setup for one song only, namely \"The Song (We Go)\" from Quartet."

In 1566 he was appointed to the Lutheran church at Erfurt, and there remained till his death in November 1575. Besides taking a share in the first collected or Jena edition of Luther's works (1556), Aurifaber sought out and published at Eisleben in 1564\u20131565 several writings not included in that edition. He also published Luther's Letters (1556, 1565), and Table Talk (1566). This popular work, which has given him most of his fame, is unfortunately but a second or third hand compilation."

Born at Cockington near Torquay, Devonshire, England in 1783, Sweet worked as a gardener from the age of sixteen, and became foreman or partner in a series of nurseries.  He was associated with nurseries at Stockwell, Fulham and Chelsea. In 1812 he joined Colvills, the famous Chelsea nursery, and was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society. By 1818 he was publishing horticultural and botanical works. He published a number of beautifully illustrated works on plants cultivated in British gardens and hothouses. The fine plates were mainly drawn by Edwin Dalton Smith (1800\u20131883), a botanical artist, who was attached to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.  His works include Hortus Suburbanus Londinensis (1818), Geraniaceae (five volumes) (1820\u201330), Cistineae, Sweet's Hortus Britannicus (1826\u201327), Flora Australasica (1827\u201328) and British Botany (with H. Weddell) (1831).  He died at Chelsea, London in January 1835. He was charged with receiving a batch of plants allegedly stolen from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. It was suggested that this was an attempt to frame him by an official at Kew whom Sweet had criticised. He was acquitted after a well-publicised trial. Robert Sweet received high praise from his contemporaries at his trial and was described as possibly the first practical botanist."

Since the 1960s, when he met Cornelius Cardew and helped found the Scratch Orchestra, Parsons has been strongly associated with the English school of experimental music. He was born in Bolton and studied at St John's College, Oxford before taking up composition lessons under Peter Racine Fricker at the Royal College of Music in London in 1961. In the 1960s he met Cornelius Cardew; Parsons attended Cardew's experimental music classes at Morley College since 1968. In 1969 Cardew, Parsons and fellow composer Howard Skempton founded the Scratch Orchestra, an experimental free ensemble devoted to performing contemporary music. The Orchestra broke up in early 1970s, partly as a result of the politization led by Cardew. Parsons was among the Orchestra members who refused to be associated with the Maoist politics Cardew was propagating, and left. In 1970 Parsons started working as visiting lecturer in the Fine Art department of the Portsmouth Polytechnic and in the Slade School of Art, University College London. In 1974 he and Skempton formed a duo to perform their own works. In 1996\u201397 Parsons was a bi-fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge. During this time he organised concerts at Kettle's Yard, Cambridge. Since the early 1960s Parsons has also been active as a writer on music; his writings include a number of important articles on contemporary English composers. Parsons' music is influenced by Anton Webern, composers of the so-called New York school (John Cage, Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff), various English composers he met through Cardew and the Scratch Orchestra, and, since the Portsmouth years, \"Systems\" artists such as Malcolm Hughes and Jeffrey Steele."

Fleming. As alderman again in 1897, he was elected mayor by council, after Mayor Fleming resigned in August 1897. During the summer of 1898, the new City Hall on Queen Street was completed and occupied. Ten years earlier construction had started on the city hall designed by Toronto architect E. J. Lennox. Mayor Shaw and his wife were part of the opening ceremonies and were lifted to the top of the clock tower in a wooden workman's lift. Mayor Shaw believed that the northland's development was very important to Toronto. He presided over the Toronto and Hudson's Bay Railway Commission. The commission was to determine the feasibility of building a railway from Toronto to Hudson Bay. Although the project had many supporters, the line was never built. He was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada. John Shaw left politics for a time after his mayoral term. He ran for alderman in the 1903 Toronto municipal election but was defeated.  He ran for a spot on the Toronto Board of Control in the 1904 Toronto municipal election, the first the body was directly elected, but was again defeated.

On 26 October 1941, his total then at 85 aerial victories, Gollob was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. He then served at a training facility and underwent commander training. Gollob was appointed Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG\u00a077\u201477th Fighter Wing) on 16 May 1942. He claimed his 100th victory on 20 May, and on 23 June was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords following his 107th aerial victory. On 29 August, Gollob became the first fighter pilot to claim 150 enemy aircraft destroyed and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds, Germany's highest military decoration at that time. Due to concerns that he would be killed in action, Gollob was prohibited from flying further combat missions. On 15 October 1942, he became Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer 3 on the Western Front. On 6 September 1943 he was appointed as Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer 5, responsible for the tactical fighter command of northwestern France. In April 1944, he was transferred to the staff of the Inspector of Fighters. In January 1945, he succeeded Generalleutnant (Major General) Adolf Galland as Inspector of Fighters, a position he held until the end of the war. In peacetime, he became General Secretary of the Federation of Independents, a right-wing  political party in Austria. He worked in a sales position for the Deutz AG. Married and the father of three children, Gollob died on 7 September 1987."

        "content": "Gollob was born on 16 June 1912 in Vienna, the capital of Austria-Hungary. His father, Heinrich Gollob, worked as an academic painter. His mother, Johanna (n\u00e9e Reininghaus), was the daughter of Zoe von Karajan, a distant relative of Herbert von Karajan and wife of Carl Reininghaus. Gollob was the first of five children. Both his parents had studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where they mutually befriended Gordon Mallet McCouch, an American artist of Scottish descent. McCouch was his godfather and the namesake for his first name, Gordon. Max was his middle name, not Mac, but because of McCouch, he was called \"Mac\". In his youth, Gollob already wanted to become an engineer and pilot. In 1930, as a student at an Oberrealschule, a secondary school, he built his first primary glider in Tirol, experimenting with it at the old airfield at Innsbruck. He also completed his A- and B-license to fly glider aircraft and became an instructor as well as a construction and airframe inspector. Following four semesters of mechanical engineering at the University of Graz, Gollob joined the Austrian Armed Forces in 1933 as an officer cadet in the artillery. For three years he was trained at the Theresian Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt and was promoted to Leutnant (second lieutenant) on 1 September 1936. He then served as an instructor in the Austrian Air Force and commander of Schulstaffel A (Training Squadron A). Following the Anschluss in March 1938, the forced incorporation of Austria into Nazi Germany, Gollob was transferred to the Luftwaffe (the Nazi German Air Force). There, he was promoted to Oberleutnant (first lieutenant) on 1 June 1938. On 15 March 1939, Gollob was posted to the 3. Staffel (3rd squadron) of Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 76 (ZG\u00a076\u201476th Destroyer Wing) flying the Messerschmitt Bf 110 twin-engined heavy fighter."

Gollob scored the first of his aerial victories over Poland on 5 September 1939, shooting down a PWS\u00a056 (Podlaska Wytw\u00f3rnia Samolot\u00f3w\u2014Podlasie Aircraft Factory) biplane. He also flew ground support missions, attacking an airfield and destroying several aircraft on the ground. On 21 September 1939, Gollob was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class (). Following the campaign in Poland, ZG\u00a076 was moved to Germany for defensive operations. The 1. Gruppe of ZG\u00a076 first relocated to the Stuttgart area on 29 September 1939 to defend the western border against the French and British, who had declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. From early October to mid-December, I. Gruppe operated from airfields in the Stuttgart and Ruhr regions before relocating north to Jever on 16 December 1939. There, on 18 December 1939, Gollob claimed his second aerial victory over a Royal Air Force (RAF) Vickers Wellington bomber in what became known as the Battle of the Heligoland Bight. During the battle, he shot down and killed Squadron Leader Archibald Guthrie, of No. 9 Squadron."

        "content": "On 8 April 1940, Gollob was appointed Staffelkapit\u00e4n (squadron leader) of 3. Staffel of ZG\u00a076. The unit took part in Operation Weser\u00fcbung, Germany's assault on Denmark and Norway in the opening operation of the Norwegian Campaign. In June 1940, I. Gruppe was based at Trondheim-V\u00e6rnes, when the Allied expeditionary force composed of the British, French, and Free Polish forces, were being evacuated from Narvik. In support of the evacuation, the RAF was targeting German shipping in Norwegian waters and Luftwaffe occupied airfields along the coast. On 13 June, fifteen Blackburn Skua dive bombers, six from 800 Naval Air Squadron and nine from 803 Naval Air Squadron, launched from the Royal Navy aircraft carrier Ark Royal attempted to attack the battleship Scharnhorst in the Trondheimsfjord. The flight was intercepted by the Luftwaffe and in the resulting aerial encounter, eight Skuas were shot down, the first by Gollob. That day, he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class (). Gollob then received night fighter training. At the time, he made several recommendations for technical improvement of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 single-engined fighter. Based on these recommendations, he was transferred to the Erprobungstelle Rechlin, the Luftwaffe test facility at Rechlin in June 1940. At 14:47 on 9 July 1940, Gollob intercepted and shot down Short Sunderland flying boat \"Y\" (N6133) from No. 201 Squadron. The Sunderland, piloted by Flight Lieutenant J.D. Middleton, was on patrol off Norway and crashed  southwest of Sumburgh Head. That same day at 17:20, Gollob, together with Oberfeldwebel (Staff Sergeant) Herbert Schob and Oberleutnant Gerhard B\u00f6hmel, shot down a patrolling Lockheed Hudson reconnaissance aircraft \"J\" (N7377) from No. 233 Squadron off Shetland. On 7 September 1940 during the Battle of Britain, Gollob was transferred to the Gruppenstab (headquarters unit) of II. Gruppe Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG\u00a03\u20143rd Fighter Wing) based at Arques in northern France. On 8 October, Oberleutnant Werner Voigt, Staffelkapit\u00e4n of 4. Staffel was shot down over England and taken prisoner of war. Four days later, Gollob took command of 4. Staffel. In February 1941, the entire II. Gruppe returned to Germany for a period of rest. The pilots went on a ski vacation in Kitzb\u00fchel from 9 to 28 March 1941. 4. Staffel was housed at the foot of the Ehrenbachh\u00f6he, the highest point of the Hahnenkamm. The Gruppe then reassembled at Darmstadt-Griesheim where they received a complement of the new Bf\u00a0109\u00a0F-2 fighter aircraft. On 25 April 1941, II. Gruppe began relocating back to the English Channel Front at Monchy-Breton. The Gruppe completed relocation on 4 May and flew its first mission on  7 May 1941. That day, the RAF flew several fighter sweeps over the French coast and Gollob was credited with shooting down a Supermarine Spitfire fighter, his sixth of the war and last on the Western Front. On 1 June 1941, Gollob was promoted to Hauptmann (captain)  and II. Gruppe began its relocation to the Eastern Front. The ground elements moved immediately while the air elements followed on 8 June. On that day, they flew to Saint-Dizier and then to B\u00f6blingen. On the following day, they continued to Breslau-Gandau, now the Wroc\u0142aw\u2013Copernicus Airport in Poland, via Straubing."

        "content": "In preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, II. Gruppe headed further east on 18 June. Following a stopover at Krak\u00f3w, the unit was moved to Hostynne. At the start of the campaign, JG\u00a03 under the command of Major (Major) G\u00fcnther L\u00fctzow was subordinated to the 5th Air Corps, under the command of General der Flieger (General of the Aviators) Robert Ritter von Greim, itself part of Luftflotte 4 (4th Air Fleet), under the command of Generaloberst (Colonel General) Alexander L\u00f6hr. These air elements supported Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Gerd von Rundstedt's Army Group South, with the objective of capturing Ukraine and its capital Kiev. At 17:00 on 21 June 1941, the 5th Air Corps, based at Lipsko, briefed the various unit commanders of the upcoming attack. That evening, Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of II. Gruppe Lothar Keller informed his subordinates of the attack. The invasion of the Soviet Union began on 22 June 1941. II. Gruppe flew its first missions on the Eastern Front shortly before 04:00, flying low attacks against Soviet airfields in the vicinity of Lvov in Ukraine. At 06:30 the Gruppe fought its first aerial battles. 4. Staffel claimed three victories and the Gruppenstab four. One of these victories was credited to Gollob, who claimed a Polikarpov I-16 fighter shot down at 07:00. On 25 June, II. Gruppe claimed 17 victories, 6 of which were credited to 4. Staffel. The Staffel engaged Ilyushin DB-3 bombers escorted by I-16 \"Ratas\" on a free chase mission west of Lutsk. The Soviet bombers targeted the German advance roads from Hrubiesz\u00f3w through Volodymyr-Volynskyi to Lusk. Gollob was credited with two victories over DB-3s in this encounter. On 26 June 1941, Gruppenkommandeur Keller was killed in a mid-air collision. The next day, Gollob succeeded Keller in this position and turned over command of 4. Staffel to Oberleutnant Karl Faust. In the beginning of July 1941, the front in the vicinity of the northern sector of Army Group South became increasingly fluid. This necessitated the relocation of II. Gruppe to Volodymyr-Volynskyi. By this time the war of attrition had reduced the Gruppe to 50 percent of its authorized strength. One reason for this was the almost complete lack of new aircraft or of engines and other spare parts. Another factor was overwork of the ground crews and signs of exhaustion were apparent. Flying combat air patrols over Berdychiv and Zhytomyr on 1 July, II. Gruppe claimed four victories. On this day at 19:42, Gollob claimed his tenth aerial victory over a Petlyakov Pe-2 light bomber. The following day, the Gruppe claimed 23 aerial victories for the loss of one in combat. The first victory of the day was claimed by Gollob who shot down a ZKB-19\u2014a German alias for the Polikarpov I-17 fighter, possibly a misidentified Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-1 or Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3\u2014at 05:52 in the morning. On another mission that day, he claimed two Vultee V-11 attack aircraft shot down at 11:30 and 11:43. The rapid advance of German ground forces required II. Gruppe to move to Lutsk on 5 July, then to Dubno that evening and to Miropol on 10 July. Flying missions east of Zhytomyr, Gollob claimed his 14th victory over a Polikarpov I-153 at 06:30 on 13 July 1941. A victory over a DB-3 at 11:42 and a further victory over a Tupolev SB-2 bomber at 11:44, both claimed on 16 July, took his total to 16 aerial victories. On 20 July 1941, II. Gruppe relocated from Miropol to Berdychiv. One day later, Gollob was awarded the Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe () for 16 aerial victories. On 23 July 1941 at 16:35, Gollob claimed a Polikarpov R-5 reconnaissance bomber, his 17th aerial victory. That day, II. Gruppe received orders to turn over its remaining aircraft to I. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG\u00a053\u201453rd Fighter Wing). Gollob's Gruppe was re-equipped with the Bf\u00a0109\u00a0F-4. On 28 July, the pilots were flown to Krosno on a Junkers Ju 52 where they received a full complement of Bf\u00a0109\u00a0F-4s. After a single familiarization flight, they departed to Berdychiv and on the following morning they were transferred to Bila Tserkva. During the first days in August 1941, II. Gruppe flew missions over the combat areas along the Dnieper in support of the main German attack to encircle Soviet forces near Uman, approximately  south of Kiev. Most II. Gruppe missions were subsequently in the greater Kiev area and to the north near Malyn, where Soviet forces were still holding onto the west bank of the Dnieper. Until 6 August 1941, II. Gruppe claimed five victories without loss. Two victories claimed on 5 August took Gollob's total to 20 aerial victories. He was victorious over a I-153 at 17:46 and a I-17 at 18:22. On 7 August, II. Gruppe moved again, from Bila Tserkva the Gruppe moved to Signajewka, a forward airfield near Shpola. In the days to come, the Gruppe flew combat missions over the Dnieper, between Kaniv and Kremenchuk as well to the south. Flying from Signajewka for the next 10 days, II. Gruppe claimed 64 aerial victories, including 11 on 8 August, 7 on 9 August, 8 on 12 August and 27 on 17 August 1941, the Gruppes most successful day of the entire 1941 summer campaign. In the same timeframe, Gollob increased his tally of aerial victories to 26. II. Gruppe had to relocate again to keep up with the German advance. On the afternoon of 17 August parts of the air elements flew to Kirovohrad-North airfield. Their primary mission was to protect the armored spearheads in the Dnipropetrovsk area. On 21 August 1941, II. Gruppe claimed 17 victories, five of which were by Gollob. This \"ace-in-a-day\" achievement, the first of six during his combat career, took his total to 33 aerial victories. On 25 August, III Army Corps took Dnipropetrovsk and captured the first bridgehead across the Dnieper. Until the end of August 1941, II. Gruppe primary objective was to help secure the bridgehead on the east bank of the Dnieper. In support of these battles, Gollob scored a I-17 on 22 August, a Polikarpov I-180 fighter aircraft on 24 August and a Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber on 31 August 1941, taking his total to 36 aerial victories. On 1 September 1941, the 17th Army began crossing the Dnieper in force and II. Gruppe was moved to Myronivka. Flying from Myronivka was characterized by poor weather conditions with rain and fog, as a result operations were kept to a minimum. At the time, II. Gruppes primary objective was the defense of the Dnieper crossing. In these defensive battles, Gollob score his 37th victory on 8 September. His opponent was classified as an I-26 fighter aircraft, later referred to as Yakovlev Yak-1. One day later, he claimed an Ilyushin Il-2 ground-attack aircraft. On 12 September weather conditions improved and flight operations increased. II. Gruppe flew missions in support of the armored spearheads as well as fighter escort missions for Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers. That day, Gollob claimed two victories, an Il-2 and a I-26, taking his total to 40 aerial victories. On 13 September, the Gruppe claimed 20 victories over Soviet bombers and ground-attack aircraft, including a V-11 shot down by Gollob at 17:19. On 14 September 1941, the German airfield at Myronivka came under Soviet air attack. Following the attack, Gollob and his wingman Oberleutnant Walther Dahl managed to pursue the attackers, and both shot down one of them. This victory over an I-153 claimed at 05:47 in the morning took his total to 42 aerial victories. II. Gruppe was again forced to relocate, on 15 September it moved to an airfield at Kremenchuk. On 18 September, Gollob was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross () for 42 victories. On 19 September 1941, II. Gruppe was tasked with strafing Soviet airfields in the Poltava area. That day, Gollob claimed his 43rd aerial victory over an R-5 at 13:55. He became an \"ace-in-a-day\" again on 28 September 1941 which took his score to 48 aerial victories. That day he had claimed three Pe-2s and two I-61s, a designation for the MiG-1 fighter aircraft."

        "content": "On 30 September 1941, the Gruppe was temporarily transferred from the southern sector of the Eastern Front. Their new area of operation was Sechtschinskaja, approximately  southeast of Roslavl. The Gruppe was then subordinated to the 2nd Air Corps under the command of General der Flieger Bruno Loerzer and was part of the preparations for Operation Typhoon, the planned assault on Moscow. All available German forces were concentrated under the command of Generalfeldmarschall Fedor von Bock's Army Group Centre for the attack which began on 2 October 1941. In the first days of this campaign, II. Gruppe supported the advance northeast by 4th Panzer Group and the 4th Army towards Vyazma and Yukhnov. Predominantly flying escort missions for Ju\u00a087 dive bombers and combat air patrols over the battle zone east of Desna, Gollob claimed one enemy aircraft shot down on 4 October and two more the following day, including his 50th aerial victory over a I-61. Gollob claimed two Pe-2s shot down on 6 October, the first at 10:15 and the second two hours later. The following day, he was victorious over two further Pe-2s and one Il-2, taking his total to 56 aerial victories. On that night, the first snow fell, worsening road conditions. By 9 October German units had encircled major Soviet forces in two separate pockets at Vyazma and Bryansk. In support of German ground forces, II. Gruppe detached a Schw\u00e4rme\u2014two pairs of two fighter aircraft\u2014to a forward airfield at Syevsk, approximately  south of Bryansk. From 9 to 11 October the air elements operated from the Kirov and Oryol airfields, which had been captured by German forces on 3 October. Operating from these airfields, Gollob claimed his 57th and 58th victories on 10 October, both aircraft were I-61s shot down at 12:40 and 12:43. The missions on 11 October 1941 were II. Gruppes last in support of Operation Typhoon. Orders had been received to transfer the air element and a small technical ground crew detachment, which was airlifted by several Ju\u00a052s to Chaplynka. From there, the Gruppe participated in the Crimean Campaign, the conquest of the Crimean peninsula. The transfer began on 13 October, but due to bad weather conditions, it was only completed on 16 October. At Chaplynka, the Gruppe was placed under the command of the Geschwaderstab (headquarters unit) of Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG\u00a077\u201477th Fighter Wing). The first missions over the battle zone in front of Perekop and over the Crimea were flown on 17 October 1941, either flying Ju\u00a087 escort missions or combat air patrols. On two separate missions that day, Gollob claimed two I-61s and one I-16 shot down. On 18 October 1941, the 11the Army began its attack on the Isthmus of Perekop and Ishun. II. Gruppe flew several combat air patrols that day and reported 16 aerial victories for the loss of two Bf\u00a0109s damaged in combat. Gollob alone accounted for nine of these 16 claimed victories. This was the third time he had become an \"ace-in-a-day\" and was the most successful day of his combat career. During the course of three combat missions, he increased his personal score to 70. That day he filed a claim for nine I-61s shot down, two at 07:18 and 07:20, five more at 10:05, 10:07, 10:19, 10:20 and 10:29 and two more at 14:46 and 14:48. On 19 October, Gollob again achieved \"ace-in-a-day\" for the fourth time, claiming a I-61 at 08:55, three P-2s at 12:36, 12:37 and 12:42, and another I-61 at 15:35. The next day, he was credited with one further I-61, taking his total to 76 victories. Two days later, on 22 October, Gollob made \"ace-in-a-day\" for the fifth time and surpassed eighty victories. That day he claimed three I-16s, one Pe-2 and one I-61. One day later, he claimed three aerial victories, all I-61s, and on 24 October, he was credited with his 85th victory after he shot down a I-153. Following this streak of 37 aerial victories in October 1941, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves () after reaching 85 victories. He was the 38th member of the German armed forces to be so honored. Gollob, together with Oberleutnant Erbo Graf von Kageneck, received the Oak Leaves from Adolf Hitler personally at the Wolf's Lair, Hitler's headquarters in Rastenburg, present-day K\u0119trzyn in Poland, on 5 November 1941. On 31 October 1941, II. Gruppe flew its last combat missions over the northern Crimea. The Gruppe was then ordered to return to Germany, to be stationed at the Wiesbaden-Erbenheim airfield where it arrived in early November. Prior to departure, all of the remaining aircraft where handed over to III. Gruppe of JG\u00a077. Since the start of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, II. Gruppe had claimed 504 aerial victories for the loss of ten pilots killed or missing in action, and a further nine pilots who had been injured. In addition, 27 aircraft were lost or damaged beyond repair, a further 21 aircraft received heavy damaged and another 27 were lightly damaged. On 20 November 1941, Gollob was again posted to the central Erprobungstelle Rechlin primary Luftwaffe test facility. Gollob was replaced by Hauptmann Karl-Heinz Krahl as commander of II. Gruppe of JG\u00a03. At Rechlin, he flew numerous test and comparison flights with the latest version of the Bf\u00a0109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter aircraft, as well as a variety of types which never went beyond a prototype variant."

        "content": "In early 1942, the General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters), Oberst (Colonel) Adolf Galland recommended Gollob for the Geschwaderkommodore (wing commander) position of Jagdgeschwader 77. Gollob was sent to the Geschwaderstab of Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG\u00a054\u201454th Fighter Wing) as a commander-in-training under Major Hannes Trautloft. On 1 May 1942, Gollob was officially appointed Geschwaderkommodore of JG\u00a077, replacing Major Gotthard Handrick. He took operational command of the Geschwader after he arrived on 16 May 1942. On the same day of his arrival, Gollob flew his first combat mission as Geschwaderkommodore. That day, he claimed his aerial victories 87 to 89, shooting down three Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3 fighter aircraft. Gollob's success continued the following day, when he was credited with three R-5s and one LaGG-3 destroyed. JG\u00a077 had been given the task of supporting the German ground forces in the Crimean Campaign over the Kerch Strait on the Crimean Peninsula. An anonymous JG\u00a077 pilot described Gollob's methods; \"Gollob flew from Kerch together with his wingman. They positioned themselves at a low altitude beneath a Soviet formation. Then they started climbing in spirals, carefully maintaining their position beneath the enemy formation. Before the peacefully flying Soviets had even suspected any mischief, the two planes at the bottom of their formation had been shot down and the two Germans were gone.\" On 18 May 1942, Gollob claimed his 94th to 96th aerial victories over Kerch and the Caucasus coast; all three were Polikarpov R-5 reconnaissance bombers. JG\u00a077, led by Gollob, and its I. Gruppe, led by Hauptmann Heinrich B\u00e4r, were engaged in an intense rivalry, each striving to outperform the other, and both eager to achieve the century mark first. B\u00e4r claimed his 100th aerial victory on 19 May. That day, Gollob claimed three more R-5 shot down, taking his total to 99 aerial victories. One day later, on 20 May 1942, Gollob shot down two aircraft, a DB-3 and a LaGG-3, and thereby exceeded 100 aerial victories. He was the 10th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark. On 7 June 1942, German and Romanian forces began Operation St\u00f6rfang, the final assault in the siege of Sevastopol, which resulted in the city's capture on 4 July 1942. On the first day of this operation, Gollob claimed his 102nd victory, a LaGG-3 shot down over Sevastopol. The attack on Sevastopol was still making slow progress on 9 June, largely due to the artillery deployed within the fortress. Over the battle zone, Gollob claimed a I-153 shot down that day. Gollob did not claim any further victories until 18 June. The fighting over Sevastopol was still ongoing and Gollob claimed an Il-2 and a LaGG-3 over the southern sector of Sevastopol. These two victories took his total to 105. On 21 June 1942, Gollob was credited with two victories over LaGG-3 fighter aircraft. For this achievement, on 23 June, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (), after his score had increased to 107 aerial victories. This was the 13th presentation of this award. On 1 July 1942, he was promoted to Major. On 22 July 1942, the Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG\u00a052\u201452nd Fighter Wing), Major Herbert Ihlefeld, was severely injured in a flight accident and had to surrender command during his convalescence. At the time, all three Gruppen of JG\u00a077 were lent out to other units, and Gollob had time to spare, so temporarily took over command of JG\u00a052 as acting Geschwaderkommodore. On this or one of the following days, he departed and flew to the Geschwaderstab of JG\u00a052. On 28 June 1942, the Wehrmacht had initiated Fall Blau (Case Blue), the 1942 strategic summer offensive in southern Russia. The objective was to secure the oil fields of Baku as well as an advance in the direction of Stalingrad along the Volga River, to cover the flanks of the advance towards Baku. Tasked with aerial support of this offensive was Luftflotte 4 to which JG\u00a052 was subordinated. By the time Gollob joined the Geschwader in late July 1942, the offensive had been renamed Operation Braunschweig and JG\u00a052 was located at Rostov-on-Don. Gollob claimed his first victory with the Stab of JG\u00a052 on 26 July 1942, a I-16 and his 108th in total. The next day, he shot down two I-153 biplane fighters. He claimed the first aerial victory of August 1942, his last month of combat operations, on 4 August over a Yakovlev Yak-1 fighter aircraft. He was then credited with four victories on 6 August, two Il-2, one Yak-1 and one R-5 took his score to 115 aerial victories. He claimed one Yak-1 on each of the next two days. On 14 August, he was credited with two LaGG-3 and one Douglas A-20 Havoc, referred to as a Boston. For the last time in his combat career, Gollob achieved \"ace-in-a-day\" for the sixth time on 16 August 1941. That day he claimed two LaGG-3, two I-16 and one Il-2. His success as a fighter pilot continued, as he shot down two LaGG-3 on 17 August, three I-16 on 18 August, and two Il-2 and an I-153 on 19 August, taking his overall total to 133 aerial victories. Following three victories on 20 August, two I-153 and a I-16, Gollob shot down two Bostons on 22 August. On 24 August 1941, he took his total to 142 aerial victories by claiming three LaGG-3 and one Boston. Over the course of the next four days, he scored one victory on each day, a Boston on 25 August, a Pe-2 on 26 August, a I-16 on 27 August, and another Boston on 28 August. After three victories over LaGG-3s and one Pe-2 on 29 August 1942, he reached 150 aerial victories and became the Luftwaffe's highest scoring pilot at that point. For this he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds () on 30 August. Gollob was the third member of the Wehrmacht and the third fighter pilot who had received this award. Fearing he would be lost in combat, Hitler imposed a flying ban on him. Der Adler, a biweekly Nazi propaganda magazine published by the Luftwaffe, also reported his actions in volume 19 of 1942. On 30 September 1942, Gollob was officially replaced in command of JG\u00a077 by Hauptmann Joachim M\u00fcncheberg. Gollob was then posted to the Stab of Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer 3 (Jaf\u00fc\u00a03\u20143rd Fighter Pilot Leader) at Brest-Guipavas on the English Channel Front."

        "content": "On 15 October 1942, Gollob was made Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer 3, responsible for tactical fighter command over northwestern France. Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer 3 was renamed Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer 5 (Jaf\u00fc\u00a05\u20145th Fighter Pilot Leader) on 6 September 1943. In this command position, he was promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 20 April 1943, effective as of 1 April, and to Oberst on 1 May 1944. When he became Jaf\u00fc\u00a05 he frequently submitted reports to his superiors at the 5. Jagd-Division (5th Fighter Division) about the suitability of the Bf\u00a0109 on the Western Front. He indicated that in its present state the Bf\u00a0109\u00a0G-3 to G-6 were no longer adequate for service in the West and that the Fw\u00a0190 and Bf\u00a0109 were inferior to enemy aircraft. Learning about the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet-powered aircraft, Gollob became a strong advocate of it and its employment as fighter aircraft. Hitler had become interested in the idea of using the Me\u00a0262 in a fighter-bomber role, which contributed to the delays in preparing the aircraft for operational readiness as an interceptor. In April 1944, Gollob was transferred to the personal staff of General der Jagdflieger Galland, to advise on the development of the Me\u00a0262 jet and Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket aircraft projects. Gollob quarrelled with Galland in September and was transferred to Kommando der Erprobungstellen (headquarters of test units), which two years previously had been put under the command of Oberst Edgar Petersen. Gollob was also involved in the development and testing of the FuG 217 Neptun \"J2\" and FuG 218 Neptun \"J3\" airborne radar specifically for single-engined night fighters and air-to-air rockets, such as the R4M. In November 1944, Gollob was appointed commander of the J\u00e4ger-Sonderstab\u2014or special fighter command\u2014for the Ardennes offensive and the ill-fated Operation Bodenplatte. On 11 November, Reichsmarschall (Marshal of the Reich) Hermann G\u00f6ring, the Commander-in-Chief of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (Air Force High Command), organized a meeting of high-ranking Luftwaffe officers, including Gollob. The meeting, also referred to as the \"Areopag\" was held at the Luftkriegsakademie (air war academy) at Berlin-Gatow. This Luftwaffe version of the Greek Areopagus\u2014a court of justice\u2014aimed at finding solutions to the deteriorating air was situation over Germany. On 15 November, Gollob and Leutnant Karl Schn\u00f6rrer, Hauptmann Heinz Str\u00fcning, Major Georg Christl, Major Rudolf Schoenert, Major Josef F\u00f6z\u00f6 formed the guard of honor at Walter Nowotny funeral at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna. Nowotny had been killed in action on 8 November while evaluating the Me\u00a0262 under combat conditions. The eulogy was delivered by Generaloberst Otto De\u00dfloch. Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler had suggested to Hitler that he appoint Gollob as General der Jagerflieger. Himmler's intervention in Luftwaffe affairs had been an irritation to G\u00f6ring. Himmler had ambitions to expand his influence and power base into the Luftwaffe. One aspect of this was to put jet fighter units under control of the SS and later, G\u00f6ring ordered Galland to prepare a report on Gollob. Galland's conclusion was that Gollob required close supervision in a responsible post. In early January 1945, G\u00f6ring summoned Gollob to Karinhall, G\u00f6ring's estate northeast of Berlin, and read out selected excerpts from Galland's report to him and Gollob became infuriated with Galland. G\u00f6ring then ordered Galland to Karinhall and informed him of his dismissal. During the meeting, G\u00f6ring postponed his decision as to what position Galland would receive and sent Galland on vacation. News of Galland's dismissal soon spread, leading to the failed Fighter Pilots' Revolt, an insurrection of a small group of high-ranking Luftwaffe pilots, including Oberst Johannes Steinhoff who after the war became Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, aimed at re-instating Galland as General der Jagerflieger. On 31 January 1945, Gollob was officially appointed  as General der Jagerflieger. In his new role, Gollob worked with General der Flieger Josef Kammhuber, responsible for fighting against the enemy four-engined bombers, and SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Hans Kammler, responsible for air armament and manufacturing of the Me\u00a0262. Gollob's objective was to deploy and arm the Me\u00a0262 as a defensive weapon against the Allied air offensive. Hitler's decision to use the Me\u00a0262 in a fighter bomber role had not been revised. Gollob gathered data and hoped to meet Hitler to convince him that the Me\u00a0262 was better suited as a fighter aircraft and not as a fighter bomber, but this meeting never occurred. On 7 April 1945, frustrated over the lack of progress made, Gollob submitted his written request to be released from office as General der Jagerflieger, but the request was not approved by G\u00f6ring. Gollob left Berlin on 10 April 1945 after his staff had left for southern Germany. At that time he needed urgent hospitalization to treat his appendicitis. Gollob underwent surgery by Prof. Dr. Burghard Breitner at a hospital in Igls, in the present-day a borough of Innsbruck, eight days after his departure from Berlin. On 24 April, he was transferred to the Luftwaffe hospital at Kitzb\u00fchel, which was in the middle of the so-called Alpine Fortress. At Kitzb\u00fchel, he met with the last Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, Generalfeldmarschall Greim and the female pilot Hanna Reitsch. Greim was convalescing from an injury sustained during a flight by Reitsch into the encircled city of Berlin on 26 April. At Kitzb\u00fchel, Gollob was taken prisoner of war by elements of the 36th Infantry Division of the United States Army under the command of General John E. Dahlquist. Shortly after, he was transferred into the custody of the US 42nd Infantry Division commanded by Major General Harry J. Collins."

        "content": "On 1 June 1945, Gollob, who had been released on parole, was arrested by the Austrian Gendarmerie acting for the US authorities. From Kitzb\u00fchel, he was taken via Pass Strub, and other internment camps, to Ludwigsburg in W\u00fcrttemberg, and then flown to England. In England, he was held at Latimer and interrogated at the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre regarding combat operations. He was released by US forces in 1946 and was then interned by the French authorities, as his home region of North Tyrol had become part of the French Occupation Zone. After release, Gollob made a living by contributing to aircraft magazines and lecturing. In 1948, Gollob became General Secretary of the Federation of Independents  (German: Verband der Unabh\u00e4ngigen, VdU), a right-wing political party in Austria. Gollob adhered to strongly German nationalist viewpoints. In June 1950 he caused a public scandal, when he spoke at a public rally held by the Styrian organization of the VdU in Graz. Gollob had criticized the anti-Nazi legislation and called the Austrian Government a \"fake democracy\". As a consequence the Styrian party organization was banned by the Austrian government to avoid a ban of the party as a whole by the Allied Council. For the same reason the party at first suspended and on 20 July 1950 expelled Gollob from the party. This resulted in a bitter strife between the party's factions. Gollob's expulsion was revoked. On 1 October 1950 he was elected to be one of the deputies of party leader Herbert Kraus. In 1951 Gollob moved to Germany. Gollob and his wife Elisabeth L\u00fcning, had married on 14 February 1943, and had two sons and a daughter. Their first son, Ulrik, was born on 30 November 1943 in Kitzb\u00fchel, their second son, Gerald was born on 9 January 1946, also in Kitzb\u00fchel, and their daughter Cornelia was born on 16 March 1954 in Sulingen. The family had moved to his wife's hometown of Sulingen. There, from November 1951, he started working in a sales role for the Kl\u00f6ckner Humboldt Deutz AG, a company making motors and vehicles. Until a myocardial infarction impeded his health in 1975, he  regularly flew powered and glider aircraft. Gollob died in Sulingen, Diepholz, Lower Saxony on 7 September 1987."

However Ibn Hawqal was more than an editor, he was travel writer writing in the style followed later by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri in his Kitab al-Mas\u0101lik wa-al-Mam\u0101lik, a literary genre which uses reports of merchants and travellers. Ibn Hawqal introduces 10th century humour into his account of Sicily during the Kalbid-Fatimid dynasty. As a primary source his medieval geography tends to exaggeration and his depiction of the barbaric uncivilised Christians of Palermo, reflects the prevailing politics of his time.  Yet his geographic accounts of his personal travels were relied upon, and found useful, by medieval Arab travellers. The chapters on Al-Andalus, in Muslim-held Spain, and particularly on Sicily, describe  the richly cultivated area of Fraxinet (La Garde-Freinet), and detail a number of regional innovations practiced by Muslim farmers and fishermen. The chapter on the Byzantine Empire - known in the Muslim world as, and called by the Byzantines themselves, the \"Lands of the Romans\" - gives his first-hand observation of the 360 languages spoken in the Caucasus, with the Lingua Franca being Arabic and Persian across the region.  With the description of Kiev, he may have mentioned the route of the Volga Bulgars and the Khazars, which was perhaps taken from Sviatoslav I of Kiev. He also published a cartographic map of Sindh together with accounts of the geography and culture of Sindh and the Indus River."

His ideas of the mneme (based on the Greek goddess, Mneme, the muse of memory) were developed early in the 20th century.  The mneme represented the memory of an external-to-internal experience.  The resulting \"mnemic trace\" (or \"engram\") would be revived when an element resembling a component of the original complex of stimuli was encountered. Semon\u2019s mnemic principle was based upon how stimuli produce a \"permanent record,... written or engraved on the irritable substance,\" i.e. upon cellular material energetically predisposed to such inscription (Semon 1921, p.\u00a024). According to historian Petteri Pietikainen: Semon argued not only that information is encoded into memory and that there are 'memory traces' (engrams) or after-effects of stimulation that conserve the changes in the nervous system, he also contended that these changes in the brain (that is, engrams) are inherited. Semon's mneme-theory fell into disrepute largely because in a Lamarckian fashion it proposed that memory units are passed from one generation to another. Semon was a proponent of the theory of organic memory, which was popular amongst biologists and psychologists from 1870 to 1918. The theory later lost scientific legitimacy as it yielded no reliable data and advances in genetics made the theory untenable."

He then became first-team trainer at Ipswich Town, a post he held for 15 years, and was caretaker manager of the club for a brief period in 1964, between the departure of Jackie Milburn and the arrival of Bill McGarry. He retired in 1971 and died in 1982."

Conflicts with a school principal resulted in Weidner being banned from school. His father then moved the family to H\u00f6sbach near Aschaffenburg in Bavaria. There Weidner first met the musicians (Kevin Russell and Peter \"Pe\" Schorowsky) who would later become the first line-up for Weidner's band, B\u00f6hse Onkelz. Weidner failed to graduate and subsequently did not pursue a career, instead taking a variety of odd-jobs including working as a bartender in a tavern connected to a brothel owned by Weidner's father."

        "content": "In 1980, the 17-year-old Weidner founded the band B\u00f6hse Onkelz (\"Bad Uncles\") with Kevin Russell and Peter \"Pe\" Schorowsky. Weidner initially played guitar in the band. After Matthias \"Gonzo\" R\u00f6hr joined the band, Weidner moved to the bass. The band modeled itself as a punk band in the tradition of Slime or Abw\u00e4rts. Weidner particularly felt a connection to the Oi!-punk movement, but also to the original, non-political skinhead and hooligan movements that had come to Germany from England early in the 1980s. This inspiration expressed itself in Weidner's songs with lyrics that often glorified violence and the use of force. Conflicts with local Turkish residents and the increasing right-wing shift of the skinhead movement were reflected in the band's music, leading to xenophobic lyrics and the band's subsequent popularity with those movements. In 1983, Weidner married and struggled to find work. The first commercial releases of B\u00f6hse Onkelz earned little money. Their first album Der nette Mann was banned in Germany. For the album B\u00f6se Menschen \u2013 B\u00f6se Lieder, the band never received any money. Meanwhile, they continued to break way from the skinhead movement due to the increasingly restrictive dress codes and regulations associated with those movements, particularly as those trends conflicted with the sense of freedom embraced by the punk movement. Weidner's lyrics continued to grow musically. In the song \"Erinnerung\" he expressed his feelings about his earlier life. Nonetheless, his reputation as a \"right-wing skinhead rocker\" remained. Weidner remained faithful to his influences both musically and in his lifestyle, as expressed in his writings and interviews with the press. This attitude often led to conflicts with the press. His refusal to rename the band was seen as a sign that B\u00f6hse Onkelz had not done enough to clearly distance itself enough from the skinhead movement. This conflict with the media culminated in songs such as \"Meister der L\u00fcgen\" (Master of Lies) or \"Danke f\u00fcr nichts\" (Thanks for Nothing). Weidner's refusal to give interviews outside of the music press at that time is part of the \"mythos Onkelz\". In 1993, at MTV's \"Free Your Mind\" event, Weidner and Campino (of the band Die Toten Hosen) discussed the influence of xenophobia on their music and their fans. Though the public was skeptical of Weidner's reform, his success continued to increase. After a gig with the Rolling Stones at Hanover in 2003, Weidner stated that he would not spend his old age on the stage. In 2005, B\u00f6hse Onkelz split up. In 2014, they made their comeback in front of 400,000 people."

After many failures, he finally succeeded with the Noel Rosa's samba Filosofia, and got a contract for a weekly 15-minute show. Fearful that a samba artist with an Italian surname would not be taken seriously by the public, Jo\u00e3o Rubinato then decided to adopt a more Brazilian-sounding name. So he borrowed the unusual \"Adoniran\" from one of his friends, and \"Barbosa\" from samba composer Luiz Barbosa, his idol. In 1935 he won a Carnaval song contest sponsored by the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, with the samba Dona Boa, composed together with J. Aimber\u00ea.

He had earned a private table at the Bar Brahma, one of the city's most traditional bars. While he never lost his love of S\u00e3o Paulo, towards the end of his life he became increasingly sad about the disappearance of its traditional character. \"Until the 1960s,\" he once said, \"S\u00e3o Paulo still existed, but since then I have been looking for it, and could not find it. Br\u00e1s, where is Br\u00e1s now? And Bexiga, where is it? I was told to look for the S\u00e9. Could not find it.

The themes of his songs are drawn from the life of low-wage urban workers, the unemployed and the vagabonds. His first big hit was Saudosa Maloca (\"Shanty of Fond Memories\", 1951), where three homeless friends recall with nostalgia their improvised shanty, which was torn down by the landowner to make room for a building.  His next success Joga a Chave (\"Throw me the Doorkey\", 1952) was inspired on his own frequent experiences of arriving late at home and finding the door locked by his wife, Matilde.  In his Trem das Onze (\"The 11\u00a0pm Train\", 1964), which has been ranked one of the five best samba songs ever, the protagonist explains to his lover that he cannot stay any longer because he has to catch the last train to the Ja\u00e7an\u00e3 suburb, and besides his mother will not sleep before he arrives."

        "content": "Unlike the samba songs of the previous decades, which generally used the formal Portuguese of the educated class, Adoniran's lyrics are a realistic record of the informal speech of S\u00e3o Paulo's lower classes.  He once said \"I only write samba for the common people. That is why I write lyrics in 'wrong' Portuguese, because that is how the common people speak.   Besides, I feel that samba is more beautiful when sung that way\". The homeless narrator of his Saudosa Maloca, for example, tells of the day when his shanty was torn down by the landowner: The peguemo instead of pegamos, fumo instead of fomos, n\u00f3s sentia instead of n\u00f3s sent\u00edamos, and tauba instead of t\u00e1bua were all standard features of the speech of many paulistas. Yet, because of the strong social prejudice attached to such \"bad\" Portuguese, few if any authors before Adoniran had dared to put those \"errors\" in writing. Even lyrics ostensibly sung by poor favela dwellers, such as the classic samba Ch\u00e3o de Estrelas (\"Starry Floor\"), were paragons of correct grammar and pronunciation. Thus Adoniran's use of \"real\" Brazilian Portuguese was a revolution that may be comparable to Gershwin's use of Gullah in Porgy and Bess.  Indeed, he was often strongly criticized for it, even by poet and composer Vin\u00edcius de Moraes (of The Girl from Ipanema fame).  But Adoniran did not mind his critics, and his mastery allowed him to break with convention: as he used to say, art was required to sing in \"wrong\" language.  And the success of his most popular  songs, such as Tiro ao \u00c1lvaro (1960), was undoubtedly due in good part to the warmth and naturalness of its language. Barbosa was known as the composer to the lower classes of S\u00e3o Paulo, particularly the poor Italian immigrants living in the quarters of Bexiga (Bela Vista) and Br\u00e1s, as well as the poor who lived in the city's many shanties and corti\u00e7os (degraded multifamily row houses). He knew well the Italian-Portuguese pidgin spoken in the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo, mostly in the sections of Mooca, Br\u00e1s and Bexiga. In 1965, Barbosa wrote \"Samba Italiano\" (Italian Samba), a song that has Brazilian rhythm and theme, but Italian lyrics with some words with Brazilian influence."

A feature of this style is the samba de breque (\"brake samba\"), where the music is suddenly interrupted to make space for a few spoken words, or a sudden reversal in the melodic line.  For example, one of his great successes, the \"Samba do Arnesto\" (\"Arnest's Samba\", 1953) begins:O Arnesto nus convidou prum samba, ele mora no Br\u00e1s.\"Arnest invited us for a samba, he lives in Br\u00e1s.\" The melodic line is suspended briefly for the phrase ele mora no Br\u00e1s'', which marks it as a parenthetical remark \u2013 not only in the lyrics, but in the music as well."

Then.  Although Sony had been granted permission to use the samples by Elektra Entertainment Group, which held the copyright to the song, Laws claimed that the use of her voice without her consent nonetheless violated her statutory and common law right of publicity under California law. In November 2003, Judge Lourdes Baird granted Sony Music's motion for summary judgment on the ground that Laws's state law claims were preempted by Section 301 of the United States Copyright Act.  In 2006, that decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In 2004, after losing the lawsuit against Sony Music, Laws and her production company, Spirit Productions, Inc. (which is owned and controlled by her brother, Hubert), sued Elektra Entertainment Group (as well as Elektra's parent company, Warner Music Group, and former parent, Warner Communications, Inc.), claiming that Elektra was contractually obligated to obtain consent before agreeing to allow the \"Very Special\" sound recording to be used in \"All I Have.\"  Laws's claims were dismissed early in the case on res judicata grounds, and Spirit's claims settled in early 2007 on undisclosed terms."

        "content": "His grandfather and father were dealers in second-hand books. In 1834 he went to Vienna, where he devoted himself to literary work, and wrote the drama Die Letzte Weisse Rose, which was played first in Stuttgart and later in Carlsruhe and Frankfort-on-the-Main, and won great popularity. In 1838 Kuranda went to Stuttgart, where he became acquainted with David Strauss, the author of Das Leben Jesu; with Uhland, and with other Swabian poets. Here, too, for the first time he came into contact with public political life. He then went to Paris and Brussels. In the latter city he attracted attention through lectures on modern German literature. With the assistance of Minister Nothomb and the author Hendrik Conscience he founded in 1841 the periodical Die Grenzboten; but on account of the obstacles which the Prussian government placed in the way of its circulation in Germany, Kuranda removed its headquarters to Leipzig, where it soon became an important factor in Austrian politics. That which no one dared write in Austria was published in Die Grenzboten. Kuranda's work Belgien Seit Seiner Revolution appeared in Leipzig in 1846. After the outbreak of the movement of 1848 Kuranda went to Vienna, where he was enthusiastically received in literary circles. From Vienna he was delegated to the F\u00fcnfziger Ausschuss in Frankfort-on-the-Main, and later he was returned to the German parliament as delegate for Teplitz. Kuranda did not remain long in the Frankfort parliament. In the summer of 1848 he returned to Vienna and established the Ostdeutsche Post, which first appeared on 1 October, and in which he strove to oppose the revolutionary element. After the promulgation of the constitution (the Octroirte Verfassung), which had been forced upon the people, Kuranda had to give up his position as editor of the Ostdeutsche Post. He was placed under police surveillance because he refused to sign an engagement not to write upon politics, and some time elapsed before he could again publish the periodical, which he made the organ of the so-called \"Grossdeutsche\" liberal party in Austria, and in which he pleaded for the restoration of constitutional conditions. Kuranda may be regarded as one of the founders of liberal press conditions in Austria. Memorable is his lawsuit with Sebastian Brunner, a Catholic priest and editor of the Kirchenzeitung, which case was tried on 10 May 1860. Kuranda had pointed out in the Oesterreichische Post that Brunner collected material for his accusations against the Jews \"from very unclean and suspicious sources, whereby he spread untruthfulness and slander.\" Brunner pressed a charge of calumny against Kuranda, who, through his able defense, and after a masterful pleading by Johann Berger , was acquitted in terms which implied a condemnation of Brunner's anti-Jewish campaign. In 1866 Kuranda discontinued the publication of his paper, and devoted all his energies to politics. He fought the absolutist October policy, and assisted, as friend and confidant, the Austrian secretary of state, Schmerling, in drafting the February constitution."

On the creation of the Delegations (a kind of common parliament of Hungary and Austria with alternative seats at Budapest and Vienna) he was returned as a member of that body. One of the most distinguished members of parliament, Kuranda was a brilliant orator, and spoke mostly on questions of foreign politics. He was also for many years a member of the city council of Vienna. In 1881 Kuranda's seventieth birthday was celebrated with great enthusiasm by his political party and by the press; and the city council made him an honorary citizen. The emperor had already in 1867 honored him with the Ritterkreuz des Leopoldordens. Kuranda's great activity as a politician and publicist, which he exercised for twenty-three years as the leader of the German liberal party, was paralleled by his faithful devotion to the Jewish cause, to which he gave a great part of his powers. He was for twelve years president of the Jewish community of Vienna. As vice-president of the Israelitische Allianz zu Wien he promoted the study of Jewish science and history, in which he took great interest."

        "content": "Carlism is a Spanish political movement founded in the 19th century which, since the second half of the 20th century, upholds the claim of Carlos Hugo's branch of the House of Bourbon to the Spanish throne. In 1952, Carlos Hugo's father publicly laid claim to the Spanish throne as Javier I, but he was ignored by Spanish caudillo Francisco Franco, who later chose Juan Carlos to be his successor instead. On 5 May 1957 Javier proclaimed Carlos Hugo Prince of Asturias and Duke of San Jaime. In February 1964 Carlos Hugo assumed the title Duke of Madrid. After alienating many Carlists during the mid-1960s by his attempts to approach Franco (on whom the 1947 Law of Succession had conferred the right to select a king to succeed himself as head of state) Carlos Hugo's increasingly leftist politics prompted the prince to embrace Titoist socialism. As Xavier's health declined so too did his appearances as the Carlists' leader: Carlos Hugo's sister, Princess Maria Teresa of Bourbon-Parma, publicly supported her brother's political transition, while his mother and brother, Prince Sixte-Henri, continued to live with his father in France and to adhere to traditional Carlism. Carlos Hugo assumed Carlist leadership in August 1975. In Francoist Spain, the organization of Carlism has been known as the Traditionalist Communion. After Franco's death, also the Carlist movement was badly split, and unable to get wide public attention again. In May 1976, a year after Franco's death, two Carlist sympathizers were shot down by far-right terrorists during the annual Carlist convocation. Among the terrorists were Stefano Delle Chiaie and members of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A), with logistic support from Francoist elements inside Spanish intelligence agencies and the Civil Guard. This incident became known as the Montejurra massacre. In the first democratic elections on 15 June 1977, only one Carlist senator was elected, journalist and writer Fidel Carazo from Soria, who ran as an independent candidate. In the parliamentary elections of 1979, a right-wing faction known as the Comuni\u00f3n Tradicionalista integrated in the coalition Uni\u00f3n Nacional, that won a seat in Congress for Madrid; but the elected candidate was Blas Pi\u00f1ar, Francoist leader of Fuerza Nueva. Since then, Carlists have remained extra-parliamentary, obtaining only town council seats. Carlos Hugo abandoned his Carlist claims in 1979 and became a naturalised Spanish citizen as Carlos-Hugo de Borb\u00f3n-Parma y Borb\u00f3n, by royal decree of King Juan Carlos. In 1980, he left the political arena, abandoning the new \"Partido Carlista\" which he had created. The party would later become a founding member of the United Left coalition. In 2002 Carlos Hugo donated his House's archives to Spain's national historical archives. This decision was opposed by his brother Sixtus. On 28 September 2003 at Arbonne in France, Carlos Hugo re-asserted his Carlist claim.  He announced that he would use the title Count of Montemolin (conde de Montemol\u00edn) for himself, and that three of his children would have Carlist titles: Duke of Madrid (duque de Madrid) for his son Carlos, Duke of San Jaime (duque de San Jaime) for his son Jaime, and Duchess of Guernica (duquesa de Gernika) for his daughter Carolina."

Irene lost her rights of succession to the Dutch throne because the government refused to enact a law permitting the marriage. Her mother could not go to Madrid to talk Irene out of the marriage and of her conversion to Catholicism because the government advised her against it. The issue that prevented the government from making a law permitting the marriage was Carlos's claim to the Spanish throne. The Dutch government saw international political difficulties arising from a possible heir to the Dutch throne holding a controversial claim to the throne of a foreign state. Carlos Hugo and Irene were married on 29 April 1964, in the Borghese Chapel at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, by Cardinal Paolo Giobbe, the former Apostolic Nuncio to the Netherlands. No other members of the Dutch Royal Family were present; Irene's parents watched the ceremony on television. After the ceremony, Carlos Hugo and Irene had a private audience with Pope Paul VI. They spent their honeymoon in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, after which they settled in Madrid. Carlos Hugo and Irene divorced on 26 May 1981.

After gaining a 3rd from Oxford in 1899, Garstang joined the team of Flinders Petrie at Abydos. He excavated various sites in the vicinity, including the discovery of the great tombs at Beit Khallaf in 1901. In 1902 he carried out his first independent excavation in Egypt at Reqaqnah. The excavation was funded by an excavation committee, a group of wealthy donors who in turn would receive a selection of objects from Garstang's excavations in exchange for their patronage. Like Petrie before him, Garstang would continue to use Excavation Committees to fund his excavations for most of his career. In 1902, Garstang was also appointed the honorary reader in Egyptian archaeology at the University of Liverpool. In 1904, Garstang founded the Institute of Archaeology, which was affiliated with the university. From 1907\u201341, Garstang was the first professorship in the methods and practice of archaeology at the university. On behalf of the institute, Garstang excavated sites in Egypt, Sudan and the Near East up to the out break of World War I. Some of his assistant excavators include E. Harold Jones, English artist and illustrator. He served as the Director of the Department of Antiquities in the British Mandate of Palestine between 1920\u201326, and excavated at Ashkelon, 1920\u201321. He was also the Head of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, 1919\u201326. He also carried out a major excavation of Jericho from 1930\u201336, funded by Sir Charles Marston. He taught at the Egyptology section of the Faculty of Arts when this was established in the 1920s. One of his students was Pahor Labib, late Director of the Coptic Museum, Cairo. From 1936 to the outbreak of World War II, Garstang excavated Y\u00fcm\u00fck Tepe near Mersin. Garstang returned to Turkey after the War, and finished the excavation in 1948. In 1948, Garstang founded the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara, assisted by other Anatolian archaeologists including Winifred Lamb, and acted as its first director (he was succeeded by Seton Lloyd)."

A stuck throttle was initially thought to be the cause for his car to overshoot the braking point, leave the track, struck a tire barrier and slam into a concrete wall behind the barrier at the entry of the Corkscrew corner. Review of the in-car telemetry refuted this supposition. The impact caused his car to flip over the barrier and land upside down on the other side of the wall. Rodr\u00edguez was killed instantly by a basilar skull fracture caused by the impact with the wall, which was lined by only a thin layer of tires. Because of the incident, an additional tire wall was installed at the end of the straight. Rodr\u00edguez had a contract in place to compete in the 2000 CART championship with Patrick Racing."

He was an officer of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in Batavia (Jakarta) as well as a talented naturalist.  Born into an influential Dutch family, his father was Jacob Cornelis Radermacher (1700-1748), who was treasurer-general to the prince.  His uncle and his nephew were members of the Board of Directors of the VOC.  In 1757, then only sixteen years old, he had traveled to Indonesian to work as a merchant for the VOC. On 21 May 1761 Jacob married Margaretha Sophia Verijssel.  In 1762 Radermacher created a Freemasonic circle in Batavia becoming the first Freemasonic lodge in Asia.  In 1763 he returned to Holland to continue his studies, and graduated in law at Harderwijk. After graduation on 13 June 1766 he established himself as a lawyer in Arnhem.  After a short time, Radermacher made the decision to return to Batavia. On 20 December 1766 with his wife Margaretha and two sons Frans Reinier and Johannes Cornelis, they boarded the ship Tulpenburg bound for Indonesia. His youngest son, Johannes Cornelis, still an infant, died within one month of their departure. By 1776, Radermacher was promoted by the VOC to title of \"Extra-Ordinair Council of India\". During his years in Batavia, Radermacher was a staunch promoter of the arts and sciences in the Far East.  On 24 April 1778 he founded the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences (\"Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en etenschappen\"). He also donated a substantial amount of writings and collections to start the museum.  During this time he also catalogued a significant amount of flora and fauna of the islands of Java and Sumatra.  The trees of the genus \"Radermachera\" are named for him. By 1781 Radermacher was named Commissioner Concerning the Fleet and the Army, and Common Council of India.  After the death of his first wife, he married Bataviase Anna Bosch.  For health reasons in 1783, he requested permission to return to Holland.  However, while en route home in the Indian Ocean on 24 December, there was a mutiny on board the ship and Radermacher was murdered."

However in November 1915 Haxton and another man, John Lindsell, were arrested in a Covent Garden hotel in London and charged with gross indecency. Military policemen, whilst looking for deserters, had burst into the hotel room of Haxton and Lindsell to find them committing a homosexual act that was not buggery. On December 7 that same year both men were indicted under the same law that had been used to prosecute Oscar Wilde. However, unlike Wilde, when the two men appeared in the Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey on December 10 they were both acquitted."

After touring the South Pacific islands, Haxton was aboard the Hitachi Maru en route to South Africa when the ship was captured by the German raider SMS Wolf in September 1917. Haxton was a prisoner aboard the Wolf until February 1918 when the Wolf returned to Germany and he was transferred to a German prison camp. He was reunited with Maugham in 1919. On attempting to return in February 1919 he was deported from Britain as an undesirable alien and was never allowed to enter the country again. Haxton's Home Office file, containing the reason or reasons for his deportation, was sealed until 2019. Robert Calder speculates that Syrie Maugham may have used her high connections in the British government to have Haxton deported. Because Maugham and Haxton traveled abroad and chose to live on the French Riviera in the \"Villa La Mauresque\", they were able to carry on their relationship despite Haxton's deportation. They lived in Villa Mauresque at Cap Ferrat almost exclusively until they were forced to flee the advancing Germans at the commencement of World War II. It is thought that Haxton's flamboyant nature, said to be portrayed in the character Rowley Flint in Up at the Villa, was the key to Maugham's invitational success with the members of society wherever the pair traveled."

        "content": "Sinclair was born in Rangiora, Canterbury, and educated at Rangiora High School. An off-spin bowler and useful tail-end batsman, Sinclair made his first-class cricket debut for Canterbury in the 1953\u201354 season when Matt Poore was in South Africa with the New Zealand team. His performances were moderate (108 runs at 15.42 and 10 wickets at 41.70 in five matches) and he did not appear in 1954\u201355. When Poore was away again in 1955\u201356, this time touring India and Pakistan, and Tom Burtt retired, Sinclair became Canterbury's leading spin bowler. He took 5 for 57 and 2 for 26 in the first match of the Plunket Shield season against Otago, 1 for 50 and 4 for 17 as well as his highest score of 40 in the next match against Auckland, 4 for 36 and 0 for 74 against Wellington, and 5 for 65 and 1 for 73 against Central Districts. All four matches were victories for Canterbury, which consequently won the competition. He took 4 for 73 for Canterbury against the touring West Indians, and was selected in the team for the Second and Third Tests. However, he took only one wicket (of Everton Weekes), New Zealand lost both matches, and he never played another Test. He was twelfth man in the Fourth Test, when New Zealand recorded their first Test victory. He played three matches for Canterbury in 1956-57 but took only four wickets."

        "content": "As a youth, Juneau played in the 1979, 1980 and 1981 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Pont-Rouge. Originally drafted by the Bruins in the fourth round of the 1988 NHL Entry Draft, Juneau was a star college hockey player at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where he scored 71 goals in four regular seasons and was a two-time All-American selection. He was well known for having a 4.0 grade point average and earning a degree in just three years in aeronautical engineering, despite the fact that he did not speak English when he first arrived in New York. After college, Juneau spent a year with the Canadian Olympic team while disputing his contract offer from the Bruins. The sticking point was Juneau's insistence on being paid full salary even if he was sent to the minors - a demand Boston refused, having been burned in a nearly identical situation with Wes Walz the previous year.  Then-general manager Harry Sinden was famously quoted in response to Juneau's threat to play in Switzerland instead \"Well, I hope he learns to yodel.\"  In the meantime, Juneau led Canada to a silver medal at the 1992 Albertville Games, and was the tournament's leading scorer. Juneau would eventually sign with Boston on the team's terms, and Sinden's fears proved groundless. Juneau joined the Bruins' NHL roster right after the Olympics, and never spent a day in the minor leagues during his career. He had an impressive nineteen points in fourteen regular season games at the end of the 1992 season before a strong playoff. His best season was his rookie year of 1992\u201393 with the Bruins, when, as the left winger on a powerful line with Adam Oates and Cam Neely, he had 32 goals and 102 points and set the NHL record for assists in a season by a left wing with 70, a mark Juneau still holds. As a reward, he was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team. During the 1993\u201394 season, the Bruins traded Juneau to the Capitals for Al Iafrate (who played only twelve games for Boston). In 1996, he became the first player ever to be awarded a penalty shot in overtime in a Stanley Cup playoff game (although he failed to score) during the second overtime of the Capitals' four-overtime loss to Pittsburgh. Juneau was also a member of the 1997\u201398 Capitals squad that reached the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals, scoring seventeen points in twenty-one playoff games. He scored the game-winning goal in overtime against the Buffalo Sabres in the 1998 Eastern Conference Finals that sent the Capitals to the Stanley Cup Finals. The next season, 1998\u201399, with the Capitals plagued by injuries and missing the playoffs, Juneau was traded to the Sabres, who reached the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals. Juneau spent the 1999\u20132000 season with the Ottawa Senators, who signed him largely to fill the offensive gap created when Alexei Yashin was suspended for failing to honor his contract. Juneau's offensive numbers steadily declined, largely due to chronic injuries. He became a journeyman, playing for five teams in four seasons before settling with the Montreal Canadiens as a third-liner for the final three seasons of his career. He announced his retirement after the 2003\u201304 NHL season.  Juneau finished with 156 goals and 416 assists for 572 points over thirteen seasons. Juneau wore No. 90 for the majority of his career, but a coincidence occurred during his time with the Bruins, Juneau wore No. 49 with the team and was unaware of the fact that a prospector of the same name, founded the city of Juneau, Alaska and that Alaska was the 49th State that entered the United States constitution, which in turn made his jersey read \"JUNEAU 49\" on the back. Juneau later admitted that his reason for choosing No. 90 was a result of his preferred No. 9 was either retired or worn by different players. The lone exception was during his stint with the Ottawa Senators when he wore No. 39. This was done as then general manager Pierre Gauthier had a policy in place where no player could wear a number higher than the goaltender. As Patrick Lalime wore No. 40, Juneau was unable to wear his customary No. 90, which he reverted to following a trade to the Phoenix Coyotes."

The team represented Japan at four World Junior Curling Championships (1996, 1997, 1998 & 1999), winning a silver medal in 1998 and another silver in 1999. The team later represented Japan at the 2002 Winter Olympics, finishing in 8th place with a 2-7 record.

At the Games, Ogasawara threw last stones as skip and led her team to a 7th-place finish with a 4-5 record, including a surprise win over one of the usual curling powerhouses, Canada. After the 2005-2006 season, Ogasawara and Hayashi announced their temporary retirement. Ogasawara got married and had a child before returning to the sport in the 2011-12 season. In 2011, Ogasawara and Hayashi, whose name had changed to Yumie Funayama after marriage, formed a new team in Sapporo. The team qualified for the 2014 Winter Olympics through the Olympic Qualification Event held in December 2013. At the Olympics, Ogasawara, a mother of one, was chosen to be Japan's flag bearer, as it is unusual for women in Japan to compete in sports after having children. At the Games, she threw last stones as skip, and the team finished in 5th place with a 4-5 record, winning against two former World Championship teams, Switzerland's Mirjam Ott and China's Wang Bingyu."

Primarily a second baseman and shortstop, the right-handed hitting and throwing Krol never reached the Major Leagues during his playing career (1954\u201366). The native of Chicago, Illinois, spent most of that period in the St. Louis Cardinals farm system, and became a playing manager in 1966 with the Rock Hill, South Carolina, franchise of the Class A Western Carolinas League. By 1972 he was managing at the Triple-A level in the St. Louis system, and received his Major League baptism as a Cardinals coach in 1977, working on the Redbirds' staff through 1980 and twice served as interim manager (in 1978 and 1980), winning one game and losing two. Krol then joined the San Diego Padres as a Major League coach (1981\u201386) and was a member of the staff of Dick Williams when the 1984 Padres won the National League pennant. Next, Krol was a minor league manager (1987\u201390) in the San Diego organization. Krol returned to the Cardinals as manager of the Triple-A Louisville Redbirds in 1992\u201393. Over his 17-year minor league managerial career, he won 1,160 games and lost 1,139 (.503) and won three championships. He died at age 57 due to cancer in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. In his memory, the Padres created the Jack Krol Award, which annually honors the club's top player development personnel."

We have a sisterhood thing going.\" She was nicknamed the \"first lady of graffiti,\" because she was one of the first women active in the early 1980s New York City subway graffiti subculture. In 1980, she created the all-female graffiti crew Ladies of the Arts. Within a few years, Lady Pink began running with the graffiti crews TC5 (The Cool 5) and TPA (The Public Animals). From 1979 to 1985, Lady Pink painted New York City Subway trains. She took a short hiatus in 1987 from painting outdoors. Then from 1993 to 1997 she worked on freight trains with her husband, SMITH (Roger Smith, formerly of the graffiti duo Sane Smith).

Born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, Eaton attended Princeton University, where he graduated in 1957.  He later lived in Rome (1957\u201368), returning to Princeton to earn a PhD in 1970.  He subsequently held faculty appointments at Indiana University (1970\u201392) and the University of Chicago (1989\u201399). Eaton was a prominent composer of microtonal music, and worked with Paul Ketoff and Robert Moog during the 1960s in developing several types of synthesizer.  Notably, he was involved in the development, use, and ultimately unsuccessful commercialization of the SynKet.  He devised a compositional genre called pocket opera, operas scored for a small cast of vocalists and a chamber group, and composed such pocket opera works as Peer Gynt, Let's Get This Show on the Road, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. His operas include The Cry of Clytaemnestra (1980), a re-telling of some of the events surrounding the Trojan War from the perspective of Agamemnon's wife Clytaemnestra, which has been hailed as the first feminist opera. It was premi\u00e8red in Bloomington, at the Indiana University Opera Theater, on March 1, 1980, and received a number of subsequent productions, most notably in New York and California.  Eaton's opera, The Tempest, with a libretto by Andrew Porter after William Shakespeare, was premi\u00e8red at the Santa Fe Opera on July 27, 1985, and subsequently performed in the autumn of 1986 at the Indiana University School of Music. During his tenure at the University of Chicago, Eaton concentrated on works for smaller ensembles, including chamber operas that involved dramatic participation of the instrumentalists alongside the singers.  He founded and directed The Pocket Opera Players, a professional troupe dedicated to the performance of his works in this genre, and occasionally those of fellow composers interested in the form. He continued to lead the Pocket Opera Players in New York City, after his retirement from Chicago in 2001.  He was a recipient of the Prix de Rome, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and a MacArthur Fellowship. Eaton died on December 2, 2015, following a brain hemorrhage. His wife Nelda Nelson-Eaton and two children, Estela and Julian, survive him."

        "content": "Demirkan played his first guitar at age 13, and attained national stardom in 1990 when he joined the Istanbul heavy rock group Mezarkabul as songwriter and guitarist. In 1992, he studied at Musician's Institute in Los Angeles with Scott Henderson, Frank Gambale, and MI founder Paul Hanson, also playing studio and live gigs. In 2000, Demir released his eponymous initial solo album with Sony Music. His albums Dunya Benim (The World is Mine) and 2004 Istanbul followed in 2002 and 2004. The latter sold in 11 European countries after his successful tour with Mike Tramp (Whitelion). The songs Demir wrote for Sertab Erener were widely accepted in Europe and Turkey. One of these songs, \u201cEvery Way That I Can,\u201d won the first prize in the 2003 Eurovision Song Competition and sold 400,000 units worldwide. Demirkan also wrote television jingles and composed soundtracks for television and films. One of the more remarkable works of Demirkan was the music he composed for the documentary about Gallipoli/Gelibolu in 2005. That soundtrack involved ethnical strings recorded in Turkey and classical melodies recorded by a symphonic orchestra and choir in the Czech Republic. It was released in Turkey and Australia. Demirkan and Sertab Erener embarked on the international project Painted on Water together. This innovative work entitled Ebru was co-produced by Demir and Jay Newland, a multi- Grammy-winning-producer (Norah Jones\u2019 \u201cCome Away with Me\u201d), and released on Mot\u00e9ma Music. His Los Angeles experience informed the current project in several ways, not least the fact that \"the L.A. vibe is great for art,\" Demirkan says. \"Every day when I was studying in Hollywood, I passed A&M Studios, and I wanted to record an album there. When we were ready to record Painted on Water, we had to search for them because they'd changed to their name to Hanson. Every time I passed by, I promised myself I\u2019d get there and record, so it was a great moment, a dream came true.\" Demirkan continues his solo career in Turkey."

        "content": "Oscar Rudolph Neumann (3 September 1867 in Berlin \u2013 17 May 1946 in Chicago) was a German ornithologist and naturalist who explored and collected specimens in Africa. He fled via Cuba and settled in the United States to escape Nazi persecution of Jews. Neumann's starling (Onychognathus neumanni) and several other species are named after him. Neumann was born in wealthy Jewish family, the son of Maximilian and Anna n\u00e9e Meyer. A younger sister of his was Elsa Neumann (1872-1902) who became one of the first physics doctorates from Berlin University. Another sister Alice was a sculptor. He travelled to German East Africa across Tanganyika, Uganda and Kenya in 1892 and collected for the Berlin Museum publishing descriptions. In 1899 he accompanied Baron Carlo von Erlanger through Somaliland and southern Ethiopia, collecting birds that went to Lord Walter Rothschild's bird collection in Tring. In 1915 he went to New Guinea and also made an expedition to Sulawesi in 1938 sponsored by the specimen collector and dealer J. J. Menden. In 1908 he lost much of his money and was hoping to work for Rothschild in Tring but this did not materialize as Rothschild himself ran into financial problems. Neumann then took to stock-broking in Berlin. In 1941, with the help of his friend Julius Riemer he fled Nazi Germany, traveling from Berlin to Cuba, then to Chicago, where he worked the final years of his life as a curator in the Field Museum of Natural History. He was elected to the British Ornithologists' Union in 1897 but resigned in 1910 due to financial reasons. He never married. Parts of his collections are now in the Julius Riemer Museum in Wittenberg."

After an economic downturn hit England in the mid 1820s, Edward's eldest brother James Henty thought that better opportunities for the family existed in Australia. In 1829 James travelled to the Swan River Colony with two other brothers, Stephen and John. Edward remained Sussex, studying and assisting his father with his business interests there."

        "content": "It was difficult to find suitable land in Tasmania and Edward was sent to explore the coast of the mainland. He reported that the district near Portland Bay had good possibilities, and after revisiting it with his father, it was decided that the land was suitable for settlement. Edward went first on the Thistle with labourers, stock, potatoes and seed. After a voyage of 34 days the Thistle arrived at Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 at 8 a.m. Edward Henty told the anecdote, The second vessel brought Mr. Francis Henty, who landed on 11 December and in course of time Mr. Stephen and Mr. Thomas followed. Sheep were fetched across from Tasmania, pastures occupied, houses erected and land cultivated. The Henty brothers also engaged on bay whaling at Portland in the 1830s. The whale oil and baleen taken from southern right whales was shipped to Tasmania for export to London. The British government had been keen to have land taken up in Western Australia and the Henty\u2032s had assumed no objections would be raised to their obtaining land in the Port Phillip district. The application was first made in 1834 and negotiations continued for many years. The father, Thomas Henty, died in 1839, and it was not until 1846 that the matter was finally settled, when the Hentys were allowed \u00a3348 for improvements at the port, and were granted  of land valued at \u00a31290. The remainder of their land they had to buy at auction. The attitude of the government at Sydney to new settlers may be illustrated by an extract from a dispatch of the governor, Sir George Gipps, to Lord John Russell, dated 11 April 1840.  The thought that the many thousands of pounds spent by the Hentys in developing the country might eventually be of benefit to the state had apparently not entered into the minds of the authorities. Neither could they have anticipated that the first sale of crown lands which took place a few months later would yield the sum of \u00a317,245. Edward Henty was determined to continue with his settlement; his brother, Francis, had joined him in December 1834, and during the next five years other members of the family joined him, and gradually all of their horses, cattle and sheep were transferred from Tasmania. On 29 August 1836 the exploring party headed by Major Thomas Livingstone Mitchell reached Portland Bay and were amazed to find the country already colonised. In later years Edward Henty was fond of telling the story of Major Mitchell when he came to a hut, from which blows of a hammer rang, saying, \"Where is Mr Henty, my man,\" and the reply of the burly blacksmith, \"Here he is at your service.\" From Major Mitchell Henty learned the character of the land to the north, and gradually he was able to acquire more land. In 1845 he had over 70,000 acres (280\u00a0km\u00b2). Sometimes the price of wool and sheep fell very low and it was impossible to sell either to advantage; but over the years the stations prospered. In 1855 Edward Henty was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Normanby and was re-elected in 1859. He was defeated in 1861 and did not sit again in parliament. Henty's last years were spent in retirement at his Melbourne mansion 'Offington' and he died on 14 August 1878. In October 1840 he married Annie Maria Gallie who survived him. They had no children. Edward Henty in addition to being the first permanent settler in Victoria was the founder of the wool industry in that colony. His portrait is in the historical collection at the Melbourne public library."

        "content": "Renato Ru\u00edz Cortes (born May 9, 1977) is a Mexican professional wrestler better known by the ring name Averno (Hell). Ru\u00edz initially worked for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) as Rencor Latino in 1995, but did not achieve any significant success until he adopted the ring name Averno in June 2001. Under his new ring name, Ru\u00edz went on to become a one\u2013time CMLL World Middleweight, CMLL World Trios Champion, NWA World Middleweight Champion and NWA World Historic Middleweight Champion and a three\u2013time CMLL World Tag Team Champion. His ring name is most commonly translated as \"Hell\" in English. For many years Averno's real name was not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. However, in May 2011, Averno was booked in a Lucha de Apuesta, where he lost his mask and was forced to reveal his true identity. Ru\u00edz left CMLL in April 2014 and joined rival promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) the following month."

Working as Rencor Latino he soon started working in the lower ranks of Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL; \"World Wrestling Council\"). He won his first Lucha de Apuestas, or \"bet match\", 1998 unmasking Apolo Chino by defeating him after a midcard feud. On August 4, 2002 Rencor Latino was one of twelve wrestlers putting their mask on the line during CMLL's Entre Torre Infernal (\"In the Infernal Tower\") pay-per-view. The match came down to Rencor Latino and veteran wrestler El Hijo del Gladiador, and ended with Rencor Latino winning the match, taking El Hijo del Gladiador's mask in the process. He continued wrestling in the midcard until he was recruited by El Sat\u00e1nico in the summer of 2001 to be part of a new Los Infernales (\"The Infernal Ones\") group."

        "content": "During a televised segment Sat\u00e1nico used his supposed \"satanic powers\" to turn t\u00e9cnico (good guy) Rencor Latino into one of his \"minions\", a rudo (bad guy) character known as \"Averno\" (\"Hell\"). Traditionally when a masked wrestler transitions from one identity to a new identity it is not publicly acknowledged, but in Ru\u00edz' case it was actually part of the storyline. As a result of the transition Averno would on occasion wrestle wearing a special mask that was half Averno, half Rencor Latino. Sat\u00e1nico and Averno were joined by Mephisto who had previously wrestled as Astro Rey Jr. The trio feuded with \u00daltimo Guerrero, Rey Bucanero, and Tarzan Boy throughout the year with Averno and El Sat\u00e1nico unsuccessfully challenging Guerrero and Bucanero for the CMLL World Tag Team Championship in August 2001. The team lost when Sat\u00e1nico was disqualified for using a low blow. When Tarzan Boy was injured and unable to wrestle Bucanero and Guerrero recruited M\u00e1scara M\u00e1gica to even the numbers. The storyline between the two factions reaches its high point at the CMLL 68th Anniversary Show where all seven wrestlers faced off in a steel cage match. The stipulation of the match was that the winning side would gain the rights to use the name Los Infernales while the loser on the opposite side would be forced to unmask or have their hair shaved off. In the end El Sat\u00e1nico pinned M\u00e1scara M\u00e1gica, forcing him to unmask. After losing the match Guerrero, Bucanero and Tarzan Boy became known collectively as Los Guerreros del Infierno (The Infernal Soldiers), while El Sat\u00e1nico, Averno and Mephisto continuing to work as Los Infernales. In 2002, Los Infernales won the Mexican National Trios Championship in Guadalajara, Jalisco and began feuding with La Familia de Tijuana (Nicho el Millonario, Halloween, and Dami\u00e1n 666). The trio lost the championship to La Familia in September 2002 but continued feuding with the group into 2003. Over the summer of 2003 Los Infernales won a tournament to become the number one contenders for the CMLL World Trios Championship but lost champions Black Tiger III, Dr. Wagner Jr., and Universo 2000 on August 1. At the end of the year, Averno and Mephisto turned on El Sat\u00e1nico, but there was no major storyline feud between the three afterwards. In September 2004, Averno defeated Zumbido to win the vacant NWA World Middleweight Championship. Shortly after the championship win Averno was positioned as a rival or foil to the up-and-coming tecnico M\u00edstico. Averno and Mephisto also became de facto members of Los Guerreros del Infierno, joining forces with their former rivals. In February 2005, Averno lost the NWA World Middleweight Championship to M\u00edstico as part of their long running storyline. Two months later Averno and Mephisto defeated Atlantis and Blue Panther to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. When Shinsuke Nakamura and Hiroshi Tanahashi from New Japan Pro-Wrestling came to CMLL, Averno initially teamed up with them, the two turned on him. This led to a trios match with Averno, \u00daltimo Guerrero and Rey Bucanero defeating Nakamura, Tanahashi, and Shigeo Okumura in one of the featured bouts on the CMLL 72nd Anniversary Show. In early 2006 Averno and Mephisto were the catalyst for one of CMLL's big storylines as they defended their titles against M\u00edstico and Black Warrior twice. In the first match, they won by disqualification when Black Warrior interfered in the match after already being eliminated and in the second match Black Warrior turned on M\u00edstico, attacking his partner to end the match. In April 2006, they lost the tag team championship to M\u00edstico and Negro Casas, ending their 377-day-long reign. In 2008 Averno formed the group Los Hijos del Averno (\"The Sons of Hell\") alongside Mephisto and Ephesto, followed by Averno and Mephisto defeating Atlantis and \u00daltimo Guerrero to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship for a second time. On September 17, 2008 Averno defeated Negro Casas to win the CMLL World Middleweight Championship, becoming a double middleweight champion as he still held the NWA World Middleweight Championship. Their reign lasted only 38 days before M\u00edstico and H\u00e9ctor Garza won the championship from them. The duo became three-time tag team champions by the end of the year as Averno and Mephisto defeated M\u00edstico and Garza on December 7, 2008. The duo's third run with the CMLL World Tag Teams Championship ended on January 16, 2009 when they lost to La Sombra and Volador Jr. On July 22, Averno lost one of his middleweight championships, the CMLL World Middleweight Championship, to Hijo del Fantasma. On July 12, 2010, at the Promociones Guti\u00e9rrez 1st Anniversary Show Averno participated in a match where 10 men put their mask on the line in a match that featured five pareja incredibles teams, with the losing team being forced to wrestle each other with their mask on the line. His partner in the match was \u00daltimo Guerrero, facing off against the teams of Atlantis and Ol\u00edmpico, M\u00edstico and El Oriental, Histeria and La Sombra, Volado Jr. and El Alebrije. Averno and \u00daltimo Guerrero was the third team to escape the match. In mid 2010 CMLL abandoned the NWA World Middleweight Championship after repeated complaints from the National Wrestling Alliance, instead they created the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship and made Averno the first champion. Averno was one of 14 men putting their masks on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas steel cage match, the main event of the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show. Averno was the first man to leave the steel cage with all three members of Los Hijos del Averno quickly leaving the cage, keeping their masks safe. In April 2011, Averno began feuding with La M\u00e1scara, building a storyline that led to a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuesta on June 17. The match announcement came on the heels of a report that Averno had signed a contract with WWE, supposedly following long time in-ring rival M\u00edstico who had already signed with WWE. On June 17 at CMLL's Juicio Final (\"Final Judgement\") show, Averno was defeated by La M\u00e1scara two falls to one and thus was forced to unmask. Upon unmasking, Averno revealed that his real name was Renato Ru\u00edz Cortes, that he was 34 years old originally from Mexico City and had been wrestling for 16 years. Afterward, Ru\u00edz and La M\u00e1scara continued their rivalry, building up to another singles match on July 4, where Ru\u00edz successfully defended the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship. Despite rumors Averno never began working for WWE, opting at the time to stay with CMLL. On July 15, Los Hijos del Averno defeated La Generaci\u00f3n Dorada (La M\u00e1scara, M\u00e1scara Dorada and La Sombra) to win the CMLL World Trios Championship. On September 9, 2011 Averno entered CMLL's annual tournament of champions, the Universal Championship tournament. After defeating CMLL World Super Lightweight Champion Virus and old rival, Mexican National Light Heavyweight Champion La M\u00e1scara, in his first two matches, Averno defeated CMLL World Tag Team Champion \u00daltimo Guerrero in the semi-finals. On September 16, Averno was defeated in the Universal Championship finals by La Sombra. On November 22, Averno lost the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship to La M\u00e1scara. On February 19, 2012, Los Hijos del Averno lost the CMLL World Trios Championship to El Bufete del Amor (\"The Law of Love\"; Marco Corleone, M\u00e1ximo, and Rush). Averno was forced to team up with constant rival La Mascara, for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles, just like he was for the 2012 tournament. The team worked together without too many problems in the first round as they defeated the team of El Hijo de Fantasma and El Felino, but stumbled in the second round as they lost to eventual tournament winners La Sombra and Volador Jr. On April 26, 2013, at the Arena Mexico 57th Anniversary Show Averno defeated M\u00edstico La Nueva Era to win the vacant Mexican National Welterweight Championship. On September 13 at CMLL's 80th Anniversary Show, Averno defeated Blue Panther in a submission only Lucha de Apuestas match, which forced Blue Panther to have all his hair shaved off as a result. On December 1, Averno lost the Mexican National Welterweight Championship to Tit\u00e1n. On April 28, 2014, CMLL announced that Averno had parted ways with the company."

Averno only wrestled one match in the tournament, participating in a twelve-man three tag team elimination match, at the Victory Road pay-per-view. Averno was the fourth man eliminated from the match at the hands of Team Japan's Masato Yoshino. Later during the same show Volador Jr. won an Ultimate X match, earning enough points for Team Mexico to win the entire tournament, becoming the 2008 World X Cup holders.

        "content": "On May 17, 2014, Averno made his debut for Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), joining the rudo stable La Sociedad. In a main event six-man tag team match, Averno teamed with Chessman and Pentag\u00f3n Jr. to defeat Cibern\u00e9tico, F\u00e9nix and Psycho Clown, pinning F\u00e9nix for the win. After the match, Averno was attacked by an unnamed \"mysterious wrestler\", portrayed by his old rival M\u00edstico. On September 26, Averno and Chessman came together with Cibern\u00e9tico to reform the Los Hell Brothers stable, with Averno replacing former member Charly Manson for this incarnation of Los Hell Brothers. In February 2015, Los Hell Brothers officially joined La Sociedad. On June 14, 2015, at Verano de Esc\u00e1ndalo, Averno won his first title in AAA, when Los Hell Brothers captured the AAA World Trios Championship. At Tripleman\u00eda  XXIII Los Hell Brothers successfully defended the AAA World Trios Championship in a Steel Cage match, defeating the trios of F\u00e9nix and Los G\u00fceros del Cielo (Ang\u00e9lico and Jack Evans) and Los Perros del Mal (El Hijo del Fantasma, Pentag\u00f3n Jr., El Texano Jr.) In late 2015 Cibern\u00e9tico left AAA, which forced AAA to strip Los Hell Brothers the trios championship on January 6, 2016. On January 22 at Guerra de Titanes, Averno and Chessman won the vacant AAA World Tag Team Championship. However, immediately afterwards, La Sociedad turned on the two and expelled them from the group. Los Hell Brothers subsequently made several successful title defenses and began bragging about how there were no challengers left for them to deal with, that \"no man\" could defeat them. In the spring of 2016 sisters-turned-rivals Mari Apache and Faby Apache reunited as Mari returned to the tecnico side and started to team up with her sister on a regular basis. At that point in time the Apaches challenged Los Hell Brothers, demanding that they put the tag team championship on the line, a challenge that Averno and Chessman turned down, acting very dismissing and sexist in the process. During the July 8 AAA Television taping Averno and Chessman dressed up as a pair of frumpy women as they mocked Los Apaches. At the subsequent taping Los Apaches distracted Averno and Chessman during a title defense against Jack Evans and Ang\u00e9lico, which lead to Averno and Chessman losing the tag team championship. Afterwards it was announced that Averno and Chessman had finally agree to face Los Apaches at Tripleman\u00eda XXIV. The match at Tripleman\u00eda XXIV ended in a no-contest after Chessman and Averno hit the Apaches with fluorescent light tubes, causing Gran Apache to come to their aid. Averno and Chessman then paired up with Ricky Marvin to form a new trio named OGT, winning the AAA World Trios Championship on November 4. They lost the title to El Apache, Faby Apache and Mary Apache on March 5, 2017, when Marvin was defeated by Faby in a singles match."

During the party's first official meeting in Recoaro on 9 December 1979, Tramarin gave a famous speech titled Venetian Autonomy and Europe: \"Today for Venetians the moment has come, after 113 years of Italian unitary colonization, to take their natural and human resources back, to fight against the wild exploitation that has brought emigration, pollution and rooting out from their culture\". In 1983 he was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies and thus became the first deputy of his party's history. Soon after the election Franco Rocchetta, who had been behind the scenes up to that moment and was disappointed by his missed election, hinted that Tramarin should step down from the post of party leader. After a power struggle, Rocchetta won the battle for the party's leadership and Tramarin was replaced as national secretary by Marilena Marin, future wife of Rocchetta. Subsequently, Tramarin, while continuing to represent Liga Veneta in the Italian Parliament, was ousted from the party and formed Liga Veneta Serenissima, which proved to be a very unsuccessful political party, gaining only 0.2% of the vote in the 1985 regional election. Tramarin never joined Lega Nord but had been active in Liga Veneta Repubblica, a minor Venetist party led by Fabrizio Comencini."

The traditional account goes on to say Antipas was martyred during the reign of Nero (54-68), by burning in a brazen bull-shaped altar at the Appollyon temple in Lyon/ Geneva Switzerland. There is a tradition of oil (\"manna of the saints\") being secreted from the relics of Saint Antipas. Saint Antipas is invoked for relief from toothache, and diseases of the teeth. On the calendars of Eastern Christianity, the feast day of Antipas is April 11."

He was a cousin of Ernst R\u00fcdiger von Starhemberg (1638\u20131701), the famous commander of Vienna during the Turkish siege of 1683, and acted as his aide-de-camp during that siege. Guido followed his cousin, and later Prince Eugene of Savoy, in battles against the Turks. In the War of the Spanish Succession, Starhemberg fought in Italy and Spain. Between 1706 and 1708 he was the commander-in-chief of the imperial army in Hungary, leading military operations against the insurgents of Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi. In 1708, he was appointed Supreme Commander of the Austrians in Spain. Together with James Stanhope he succeeded in conquering Madrid in 1710, after previously gaining victories at Almenar and Saragossa. In December, however, he was forced to leave the city by the lack of support by its inhabitants for the Habsburg pretender. After the subsequent defeats at the Battle of Brihuega and the Battle of Villaviciosa (1710), he had to pull back to Catalonia, where he was made viceroy when Archduke Charles returned to Austria. After the Peace of Utrecht (1713), archduke Charles, now Emperor Charles VI, ordered him to abandon Catalonia. He pulled back with his troops to Genoa on English ships. When he died in 1737, he was Governor of Slavonia."

He was born in 1873, the son of Joseph and Charlotte Mears. In 1896, Mears and his brother Joseph purchased the Stamford Bridge Athletics Ground and later the nearby market garden with the intention of turning it into the country's finest football ground and staging high-profile matches there. He failed to persuade Fulham FC chairman Henry Norris to re-locate his club to the ground, and considered selling the land to the Great Western Railway Company, who wished to use it as a coal yard. Mears was ultimately persuaded not to sell up, and instead decided to found his own team, Chelsea, in March, 1905. The story goes that he was on the verge of giving up on the football project when his Scotch Terrier bit his colleague Fred Parker, who still supported the idea. So impressed was Mears with his friend's reaction, he decided to take his advice. Mears was on the club's first board of directors, but did not live to see the club achieve any success. His dream of making Stamford Bridge one of England's top stadiums was realised, however, as it staged the FA Cup Final from 1920-22. His descendants continued to own the club until 1982, when his great-nephew Brian sold it to Ken Bates."

He finished his rugby career at Bath Rugby where a debilitating toe injury limited his appearances and finally ended his playing career. Geoghegan is perhaps best known for his try in the 1994 Five Nations match against England at Twickenham, that was instrumental in a famous 13\u201312 win. Another key contribution during the match was a  kick, chase and tackle on England fly-half Rob Andrew which led to a crucial kickable penalty to Ireland. An adept side stepper, he was once described by the commentator Bill McLaren as being \"Like a mad trout up a burn\". Geoghegan was controversially left out of the 1993 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand when England's Ian Hunter and Tony Underwood were taken ahead of him.  Former New Zealand hooker and Geoghegan's then London Irish coach Hika Reid was quoted at the time as being surprised as he felt the conditions would have suited him.  In 1997 the Lions management apparently held a place open for him until the last possible minute, even though he had played little rugby that year due to the toe problems that cut short his career. As an amateur player Geoghegan had a career outside rugby as a solicitor.  He is currently a real estate and finance partner in London at  Rosling King LLP Geoghegan qualified for Ireland through his Galway born father.

His published work included science fiction, westerns, and mysteries, as well as academic non-fiction. He generally wrote as Louis Trimble, but used the pseudonym \"Stuart Brock\" for some of his work. Born in Seattle, Washington, he published his first story in 1938, but did not move into the science-fiction genre until the mid-1950s. He attended a number of universities in Washington state and Pennsylvania. After working as a logger and a housepainter, he became an instructor and professor in humanities and social studies at the University of Washington from 1956 onward. Trimble's work in applied linguistics examined the use of English in science and technology contexts. As a member of the Washington School he advanced the \"grammatical-rhetorical\" position in English for Science and Technology research, which argued that linguistic analysis of scientific discourse should consider the ways in which various rhetorical functions manifested grammatically in texts at the discourse level."

He officiated three group games: Germany vs Costa Rica, Czech Republic vs Ghana, and Switzerland vs South Korea. He also took charge of the England vs Portugal quarterfinal, as well as the final game between Italy and France, becoming the first referee in World Cup history to referee both the opening and final games of one World Cup, a feat later matched by compatriot N\u00e9stor Pitana in the 2018 edition (English referee George Reader also officiated the first and last matches of the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, but the last one, known as Maracanazo, was not technically a final). Elizondo handed out a total of 29 cards in the tournament, three of which were red, for an average of 5.8 cards per game. Elizondo took charge of the opening game of the tournament between Germany and Costa Rica, which Germany won 4-2.  Elizondo handed out one yellow card to Costa Rica\u2019s Danny Fonseca. The match had a total of 22 fouls and 6 offsides, both statistics split evenly between the two teams. FIFA's president of the World cup organizing committee Lennart Johansson praised Elizondo performance at the match, saying \"I did not notice him much which is a very good thing.\" In his following match in the  group stage, which the Czech Republic won 0-2 against Ghana, he gave a straight red card to Czech player Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ujfalu\u0161i for a professional foul in the box, awarding a penalty to Ghana.  He then gave a yellow card to Asamoah Gyan when he took the penalty kick prematurely. Gyan missed his second attempt. Elizondo also booked Czech player Vratislav Lokvenc and Ghanaian players Otto Addo, Michael Essien, Derek Boateng and Sulley Muntari, for a total of seven cards.  He called 12 fouls against the Czech Republic and 20 against Ghana.  He further ruled the Czechs offside 6 times and Ghanaians 9 times. Elizondo was also the referee in the Switzerland 2-0 South Korea group game.  Elizondo handed out nine yellow cards during the match, booking five Swiss players, Philippe Senderos, Hakan Yak\u0131n, Raphael Wicky, Christoph Spycher and Johan Djourou and four Koreans Park Chu-Young, Kim Jin-Kyu, Choi Jin-Cheul and Lee Chun-Soo.  Elizondo called 7 fouls against Switzerland and 19 against South Korea.  There were a total of six offsides calls, split evenly between the two teams. He awarded the Swiss a goal when he overruled the assistant referee Rodolfo Otero's raised offside flag. Several players, including two defenders, Kim Jin-Kyu and Choi Jin-Cheul, who were following Alexander Frei stopped playing when they saw the flag. The ball was put into the path of Alexander Frei after being hit by Lee Ho's foot. Korea's coach Dick Advocaat was livid at the time, but a few days later agreed that the decision to allow the goal was correct. Elizondo was the referee in the England 0-0 Portugal quarter-final, which Portugal won 3-1 on penalties. Elizondo gave yellow cards to Ricardo Carvalho and Petit of Portugal and to Owen Hargreaves and John Terry of England, as well as a straight red card to England's Wayne Rooney after he stood on Ricardo Carvalho's groin, for a total of 5 cards.

His father, Francis Kiernan (died 7 March 1850 at 30 Manchester Square, London), was also a physician and brought the family to England in the early 19th century. Francis junior was educated at the Roman Catholic College at Ware, Hertfordshire, and was trained in medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He set up a private anatomy class in Charterhouse Square, but, in the words of the British Medical Journal, his \"great success as a teacher caused much jealousy, and, in 1825, gave rise to the Council of the College of Surgeons passing a resolution refusing to receive certificates from any but recognised teachers.\" Kiernan's class size dwindled as students departed. Appeals to the Council to rescind its decision, on the grounds of Kiernan's ability and skill as a teacher, were dismissed. He became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1825. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1834 and was awarded its Copley Medal in 1836 for his work on the anatomy of the liver. That same year, he became a founding Member of the Senate of the University of London, where he acted as examiner and lecturer in anatomy and physiology. In 1843, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and served on its Council from 1850. After a single year as Vice-President (1864\u20135), he declined re-nomination on the grounds of ill-health, having suffered a paralytic stroke in 1865 from which he never fully recovered. In 1849, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. He died unmarried at his home in Manchester Street, Manchester Square, London on New Year's Eve, 1874, and was buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery at Mortlake, London."

On 9 July 1961 Panagiotis Kanellopoulos as Deputy Prime Minister in Konstantinos Karamanlis' government and German Vice-Chancellor Ludwig Erhard signed the protocols of Greece's Treaty of Association with the European Economic Community (EEC). The signing ceremony in Athens was attended by top government officials from the six-member group consisting of Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Luxemburg and the Netherlands. The six member group was the early precursor of today's 25 member European Union. Economy Minister Aristidis Protopapadakis and Foreign Minister Evangelos Averoff were also present at the ceremony as well as Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis. His niece, Amalia married Karamanlis. In 1963 he succeeded Karamanlis as leader of the National Radical Union party (ERE). He was the last Prime Minister (acting as a caretaker for the scheduled for 28 May) prior to the coup d'\u00e9tat of 21 April 1967. He was placed under house arrest for the next seven years.

After the metapolitefsi Kanellopoulos resumed his parliamentary career as a member of the New Democracy party. He declined offers to become President of Greece when the post was offered to him during the metapolitefsi. Kanellopoulos was the nephew of Dimitrios Gounaris."

The musical premiered in June 1981 at Yale Repertory Theater and was reviewed in Sports Illustrated by Robert Creamer. Magee eventually moved to New York, where he became an accomplished composer and lyricist for theatre, television, and film and commercials. He was also an established comedian who lampooned popular musicians and musical genres. He often concluded his act with a rendition of Van Morrison's Brown Eyed Girl, which soon become a trademark. Magee co-produced and wrote the music for hundreds of one-act plays as Musical Director and co-founder (with comedian Lewis Black and Rand Forester) of Steve Olsen's West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar in New York City. The theatre was known for cultivating raw, undiscovered talent and many renowned playwrights such as Aaron Sorkin, Warren Leight and Alan Ball had works staged at the West Bank Cafe early in their careers. In 1986, Magee appeared in a bit part (as a comedian named Ronnie) in Woody Allen's film Hannah and Her Sisters (the film also featured Lewis Black). That same year, he arranged and performed the music for the Tony Award-winning production of The House of Blue Leaves at Lincoln Center and on Broadway and PBS. He won the New York James Fleetwood Outer Critics Circle Award for his music and lyrics for Moli\u00e8re's Scapin (starring Stanley Tucci). %5D This adaptation has been produced at CSC Repertory Theatre, Yale Repertory Theatre, the Intiman Playhouse in Seattle, the Court in Chicago, and American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco.  He wrote the music and lyrics for ART's production of Carlo Goldoni's Servant of Two Masters and Moli\u00e8re's The Imaginary Invalid. Magee once again collaborated with Lewis Black on The Czar Of Rock And Roll, a musical based on the real-life story of singer Dean Reed. The show was staged at Houston's famous Alley Theatre in 1990. Two years later, Magee began working with RENT composer Jonathan Larson, Bobby Golden and Paul Scott Goodman on a new musical called Sacred Cows, an irreverent retelling of the Creation Myth. %5D The musical was never staged, but a demo recording (sung mostly by Larson and Magee) was released on iTunes over 20 years later. In 1995, Magee wrote the music and lyrics for Ubu Rock, a musical based on Alfred Jarry's controversial 1896 French play Ubu Roi. Co-written Shelley Berc and Andrei Belgrader, Ubu Rock premiered at the ART. The Boston Globe called the show \"scatological, sexually puerile and deliberately offensive, even in the Beavis and Butt-head age,\" but raved it was \"the most entertaining and provocative production of the American Repertory Theatre schedule.\" [4]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}  His full length musical The Green Heart (co-written with playwright Charles Busch) was produced by The Manhattan Theatre Club in 1997, and is published by Samuel French. With Moonwork Theatre Company, Magee composed music for Off-Broadway adaptations of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (in which he played Feste) and A Midsummer Night's Dream (in which he played Peter Quince) %5D  %5D He was also Music Director of the Irish Repertory Theatre (Manhattan), a role he continued in even after his illness was diagnosed. With the Irish Rep, Magee composed the music for Frank McCourt's musical The Irish...And How They Got That Way. The full musical was recorded by PBS and released on video; a cast album was also released on the Universal Music Group label. Magee collaborated again with Bobby Golden, writing songs for Nickelodeon's animated series The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss, as well as Out of the Box on the Disney Channel. Golden and Magee's song \"Road To Victory\" was featured in the documentary film New School Order. Magee wrote songs for Arthur: A Live Adventure, a musical based on the \"Arthur\" children's books by Marc Brown and the PBS animated series Arthur. It was presented at Radio City Music Hall in New York City in May 2000 as well as at theaters nationwide. Magee, with Billy Aronson (co-conceiver of RENT) wrote the children's opera Flurry Tale, which was produced by American Opera Projects/Family Opera Initiative in New York City. %5D His cabaret anthem, \"New York Romance\", was performed at Carnegie Hall  by his wife, Alison Fraser  and his music has been sung by renowned performers such as Mary Testa, Rebecca Luker, Judy Kuhn, Pattie Darcy Jones and Annie Golden."

In 2004 J\u00f6back collaborated with Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra conducted by Nick Davies in a project called Storybook where he performed classic songs in brand new arrangements. GSO and J\u00f6back released a CD which became a Gold Disc and also performed two concerts in the Globe Arena and Scandinavium Arena in Sweden. The album also brought J\u00f6back to a superstar status in Norway. His first solo tour there in 2005 was a success both with audience and media."

According to Rauf Ahmed, though the film was not a success at the box-office, Sajid's performance was praised by the critics. After his father's death in 1964, Sajid was sent to the United States by his mother Sardar. He went on to achieve fame in the United States with a co-starring role alongside Jay North in the 1966 film Maya. The film's success led to a television series of the same name airing on NBC from September 1967 to February 1968 and lasting 18 episodes. The show led to Sajid becoming a \"teen idol\" for a short time appearing on the cover of popular magazines worldwide. He also had a short-lived singing career but was not successful. In 1968, he guest starred in an episode of the television series The Big Valley, and appeared in the music variety show It's Happening as a guest judge. He also found success in the Philippines in the early 1970s, starring as the male lead in a number of romantic comedy films opposite leading Philippine actresses Nora Aunor and Vilma Santos. He tried to get back into Hindi films, but none of his Hindi films from 1972 to 1983 worked financially. His career's peak period was in 1966\u20131974 and he was more successful in English films. He made his last film appearance in the Merchant Ivory film Heat and Dust in 1983 which was successful."

        "content": "Davidson was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, and began studying piano at age four. When he was twelve, he became the organist at the Zion Temple Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God, where his parents were pastors. He attended the Boston Latin School, graduating in 1959, then enrolled at Harvard College on a full scholarship, studying biochemistry. During this time, he began a long period of experimentation with various kinds of drugs, which may have led to the psychological issues that would later manifest themselves. After six years at Harvard, Davidson was asked to leave, as his academic performance had suffered. He apparently landed on his feet, however; Milford Graves later recalled that by 1965, Davidson was \"with a big laboratory up in Boston, with a big-time guy\". While at Harvard, Davidson became increasingly dedicated to music, and began traveling to New York City to play. During 1964, he met Ornette Coleman, and began playing with him on a regular basis. (Coleman would later refer to Davidson as his favorite pianist.) Davidson also occasionally played drums with the New York Art Quartet, substituting for Milford Graves when he was unavailable, and also played with Paul Motian, among others. (Prior to playing with Motian for the first time, Keith Jarrett heard him on a tape with Davidson; he later stated: \"it completely knocked me out\".) At the recommendation of Coleman, Bernard Stollman, the founder of ESP-Disk, agreed to record Davidson without having heard him play. In July 1965, Davidson recorded his debut album, Lowell Davidson Trio (ESP 1012), featuring five original compositions, with bassist Gary Peacock and Graves on drums. Recorded in one take, it would prove to be Davidson's only commercial recording released during his lifetime. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Davidson collaborated with many musicians in both Boston and New York. He experimented with graphic and proportional notation, and assembled a book consisting of shapes created by a color copier. (Guitarist Joe Morris recalled Davidson pointing to a small part of one of his graphic scores and telling him \"if we practice for six months we might be able to play that\".) Davidson also experimented with scores made from aluminum foil riddled with pin holes and held over a light in order to \"burn the shape of the music into your synapses\". In the late 1980s, Davidson's behavior became increasingly erratic, and he was hospitalized at the psychiatric unit of Boston City Hospital. He later contracted tuberculosis, which went untreated, and died on 31 July 1990 at age 48. Ornette Coleman was among the attendees at his funeral, which was held at his family's church. Joe Morris studied and performed with Davidson and has described the pianist as a major influence. In 1997, Morris released Antennae, an album inspired by some of Davidson's graphic scores, with bassist Nate McBride and drummer Jerome Deupree, on the AUM Fidelity label. In 2009, Morris released MVP LSD: The Graphic Scores of Lowell Skinner Davidson on Riti Records, featuring Morris on guitar, John Voigt on bass, and Tom Plsek on trombone. In 2012, Morris released Graffiti In Two Parts, a recording of a 1985 concert in Cambridge, MA featuring Davidson on bass and drums, Morris on guitar, Malcolm Goldstein on violin, and Butch Morris on cornet, on the RogueArt label. 2014 saw the release of Rediscovered Session Of 1988, on which Davidson appears with vibraphonist/pianist/drummer Richard Poole."

        "content": "Pianist Ethan Iverson described Davidson as having \"an approach somewhere between the fury of Cecil Taylor and the romance of Paul Bley\". In a review of Lowell Davidson Trio, Jerry D'Souza wrote: \"Davidson could make the piano speak in many different ways... he let his right hand find founts of inspiration and invention in beautifully flitting notes as well as deep emphasis. Davidson did not let space dominate the intervals. He let it in judiciously.\" Raul D'Gama Rose wrote: \"Lowell Davidson was one of those quintessential artists. A pianist possessed of great virtuosity, he was also a Harvard-educated biochemist and his musical art\u2014both compositions and performance\u2014and emerged from a confluence of the two. Davidson inhabited a rarified space. He understood and played with such harmonic sophistication that he may be compared in this respect only to Thelonious Monk, Herbie Nichols and Don Pullen. As a scientist-musician he believed that musical tones, if properly employed, could influence the evolution of the brain.\" Joe Morris recalled: \"His music was much more about sound. He used to talk about the upper partials clashing together. It was very slow moving, it was much more about sounds slowly morphing into other sounds... It was... like what you would call electroacoustic improvisation now. His trio music, even though it had bass and drums, moved at a very slow pace. It had a sort of groove, but it was very different. And he operated differently. His rhetoric was very different. I don't think he ever thought of himself as a jazz musician; he just saw himself as a musician. He was a very dignified, incredibly brilliant guy. He would never lower himself to some mere label.\" Morris added: \"He was so brilliant in the way he spoke about things; it was impossible to dismiss it as just crazy talk. Even though at first it sounded like that, over time I understood what he was talking about, and we could have conversations. He used to say it was about evolution, that if we play things we haven't heard before, it will alter the biochemistry of the brain. He said that's what evolution is about... I understand that what he was really trying to do was to move humans forward.\" Regarding Davidson's funeral, Morris stated: \"The music played by the church band circled and rose to the ceiling. The sounds clashed and blended. The partials merged. It sounded like Lowell's music.\" Taylor McLean, a musician who had met Davidson at Harvard, stated that despite Davidson's personal issues, his life was \"positive and victorious.\" He recalled that Davidson lived in an \"alternative universe\" in which he was successful: \"It is a form of success that is little understood, and that brings with it no comforts. The artist is driven to pursue and formulate successive objective forms. That is the only way to cross the river and stay alive in the current. It is a form of achievement and 'success' that is incomprehensible to the normative path because it comes at great personal cost, [does not] include social status, accumulation of material goods, praise and adulation, or even a supportive social network. Lowell was a champion in this area.\""

From 1824 to 1839, he was the editor of C\u00e4cilia, a musical periodical published in Mainz, which influenced musical thought in Germany during the early Romantic era. His most important work is his Versuch einer geordneten Theorie der Tonsetzkunst (\"Theory of Musical Composition\") (Mainz: B. Schott, 1817\u201321), which introduced several concepts that have since become important in the study of music theory. In this work, Weber develops the idea of \"Mehrdeutigkeit\" (that is, \"multiple meaning\"), a term initially introduced by Georg Joseph Vogler. Weber's \"multiple meaning\" refers to individual tones and harmonies, based on their context in a piece of music. For example, a C major triad may serve as I in C major, IV in G major, V in F major, etc. \"To analyze a chord, a theorist must ask not only 'What notes are in it?' but also 'How is it behaving in the harmonic progression?'\" (Thompson); see diatonic function. In the same work, Weber also further develops Vogler's idea of Roman numeral designations applied to chords. Unlike Vogler, Weber implements upper and lower case symbols to show not only the position of each chord related to the scale degree upon which it is built, but also the quality of each chord, i.e. major, minor, diminished, etc. Weber's Roman numeral system of analysis is in wide use in universities all over the world today to varying degrees, albeit with some modifications. Weber's Theory of Musical Composition was the first work on music theory to be translated into English for publication in the United States (transl. by James F. Warner, Boston: Oliver Ditson, 1846). He died in Bad Kreuznach."

At age ten he started playing an organ - intended for use by his mother, but who never picked it up. After two years of taking courses, he started his first musical group at age 13 with two fellow students and friends from middle school. After many years travelling the world, mostly Africa (especially Kenya), he started penning some naive, minimalistic ditties. His sketchy, intimate sound sometimes mixes African rhythms with reggae, and his influences such as the Dutch singer Dick Annegarn, with whom he toured in 1997. His album Michel is accompanied by an amateur film made by Boogaerts himself. His music is known for its laid-back style and many of his songs include a very light and delicate drum beat."

Despite the troubles an artist in exile must face, Shams found ways to introduce Classical Persian music in international events such as the London Festival in England. He describes his music as being attached to poetry and to the roots of Persian music. His style is described ample and accurate, paying attention to tones and sounds, to contrasts and to orchestral material full of expression. Shams has said about Persian music: \"To me, music has to bring love, harmony, pleasure, happiness, but also rhythm and movement. Our music is so-called sad. It is not. When talking about classical music, I mean it has to keep its nature, but also evolve with time\"."

He played parts of two seasons with the Whalers before being traded to the Washington Capitals in 1991. In 1994, he was traded to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. Krygier played a season and a half in Anaheim before he was re-acquired by the Capitals during the 1995\u201396 NHL season. It was during his second tour with the Capitals that he would make the most of his opportunity as his gritty style of play would help guide the Capitals to their first ever appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1998. Krygier played two seasons with the Orlando Solar Bears of the International Hockey League before retiring from active play. Perhaps Krygier's most memorable goal came in the 1998 Eastern Conference Finals as a member of the Capitals versus the visiting Buffalo Sabres. In overtime of game two, Krygier one-timed a pass from teammate Andrei Nikolishin past Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek to win the game and tie the series at one game apiece. The goal was controversial because of the possibility that the Capitals had iced the puck and a Sabre had touched it behind the goal line, but play was not whistled down. The Capitals went on to win the series in six games before being swept by the Detroit Red Wings in the Stanley Cup Finals. Krygier was previously the head coach of the Compuware AAA mite hockey team, as well as the head hockey coach at Novi High School where he won the school's first and only State Title in 2011. In June 2013, Krygier was announced as the new coach of the Muskegon Lumberjacks United States Hockey League team until he was released in July 2016. He is now an assistant coach with the Western Michigan Broncos men's ice hockey team. In 543 NHL games, Krygier scored 100 goals and 143 assists."

Though Gabaldon was recommended for the Medal of Honor, he received the Silver Star, which was upgraded by the Marine Corps to the Navy Cross in 1960. In 1960, a friend of Gabaldon's with Hollywood connections influenced the industry to make a movie about Gabaldon's version of events on Saipan called Hell to Eternity. He was called  'Gabby' by his friends, but he became known as \"The Pied Piper of Saipan\" for his heroism on that island. In 1964, he unsuccessfully ran for US Congressman in his Southern California district. In 1990, he authored a book entitled, Saipan: Suicide Island."

        "content": "The capture of Saipan was considered essential for the establishment of airfields which would accommodate the B-29 Superfortress bombers to be used in what was then the planned full-scale invasion of the Japanese mainland. On June 15, 1944, an armada of 535 ships, carrying 127,570 U.S. military personnel which included Marines from the 2nd and 4th Marine Divisions, began the invasion of Saipan. Japanese soldiers seldom surrendered during World War II and, as the American military invasion went badly for the Japanese, they were ordered by their superiors on Saipan to kill seven American Marines or soldiers for every soldier they lost, or commit suicide. According to Gabaldon, he began taking and bringing in prisoners the night of the first day that he arrived on Saipan. According to Gabaldon: Gabaldon was reprimanded by his superior officers, and threatened with a court-martial for leaving his post. However, according to him the next night he went out and did it again. He carefully approached a cave, shot the enemy guards outside, moved off to one side of the cave, and yelled in Japanese, \"You're surrounded and have no choice but to surrender. Come out, and you will not be killed! I assure you will be well-treated. We do not want to kill you!\" The next morning he says he returned with 50 Japanese prisoners. As a result, Gabaldon was permitted by his commanding officer to act as a \"lone wolf\" operator. The next day, on July 8, Gabaldon captured two more enemy guards. He convinced one of them to return to his cave, with an offering of surrender. Shortly thereafter, a Japanese officer showed up. After speaking to Gabaldon, the officer accepted the conditions of surrender\u2014and over eight hundred Japanese soldiers and civilians surrendered to Gabaldon, who turned them over to the U.S. military authorities. For his exploits, according to Gabaldon, he became known as The Pied Piper of Saipan."

Meehl, about USMC Japanese Language Officer Robert Sheeks, who also served on Saipan, Gabaldon is described by Sheeks as a relentless self-promoter who grossly exaggerated his exploits on Saipan and Tinian and that most of the Japanese he captured were civilians, not soldiers as he claimed.  The book states that the number of Japanese captured by Gabaldon was likely about half of the 1,500 that he claimed.  A total of 15,000 Japanese miliary and civilians and Pacific Islanders were captured or detained by the US during and after the battle.  Many others besides Gabaldon were involved in those efforts, but according to Sheeks, Gabaldon minimized the involvement of others when talking about his exploits during and after the battle. Author Gerald A. Meehl in interviews with Saipan veterans and in other records, found reports of abusive behavior by Gabaldon towards Japanese civilians and soldiers he encountered on Saipan.  In one instance, witnessed by Sheeks, Gabaldon struck and broke the jaw of an elderly Japanese civilian who did not answer one of Gabaldon's questions quickly enough."

Alvin C. York, in World War I. Despite this recommendation, Gabaldon was awarded a Silver Star Medal."

In 1960, the Marine Corps elevated his Silver Star Medal to the Navy Cross, the second highest US military decoration for valor. After returning to civilian life, he moved to Mexico and ventured into various businesses such as a furniture store, fishing, and the import-export of Mexican goods. When his first marriage to June Gabaldon ended in divorce, he met the woman who became his second wife, Ohana Suzuki, while working in Mexico. Gabaldon's World War II exploits became public when in 1957, he was the invited guest of This is Your Life, a popular television program aired by NBC in the 1950s. Hosted by Ralph Edwards, the show presented the life stories of entertainment personalities and \"ordinary\" people who had contributed in some way to society. Later, Gabaldon appeared as himself on the September 1, 1960 episode of the CBS game show To Tell the Truth. The fact that Gabaldon captured at least 1,500 Japanese prisoners was verified on the national program by Marines Corps intelligence officers Colonel Walter Layer, Colonel John Schwabe, Major James High, and several enlisted men from military intelligence. Hollywood producers became interested in Gabaldon's story and in 1960 released the film Hell to Eternity where his actions on Saipan were memorialized. He was portrayed by actors Jeffrey Hunter as an adult and by Richard Eyer as a boy. Gabaldon himself served as an adviser in the filming of the movie."

Sheets was selected as the first of the Orioles' four picks in the second round (29th overall) of the 1978 MLB draft, nineteen slots ahead of Cal Ripken Jr. His lack of enthusiasm and commitment to the sport while in the minors frustrated Orioles scouts and officials and was chronicled in an article written by Alexander Wolff in the June 15, 1981 issue of Sports Illustrated. In a 13\u201311 loss to the Texas Rangers at Memorial Stadium on August 6, 1986 which was the first-ever game in MLB history that featured three grand slams, Sheets and Jim Dwyer each hit one in the fourth inning off Bobby Witt and Jeff Russell respectively. Toby Harrah had hit the first one of the contest off Ken Dixon two innings earlier in the second. After six seasons in Baltimore, Sheets was dealt to the Tigers for Mike Brumley on January 10, 1990 in a transaction where the Orioles sacrificed a much-needed power hitter for a younger, less expensive player. His 1989 Donruss Baseball Card said he was 6'3\", weighed 235 pounds, and lived in Cockeysville, Maryland, at the time. Sheets had career highs in batting average (.316), home runs (31) and RBIs (94) in 1987. Sheets operates a youth sports facility in Westminster, Maryland, and serves as Gilman School's head Varsity Baseball coach. He has a son named Gavin who plays for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB)"

This is a reason why I decided to join the club, besides the fact that I will continue playing in the highest level (i.e. Super League).\" His career is declining and during 1,5-year in Iraklis did not succeed to make the difference. He made his debut with the club in a 2\u20131 home loss against Panserraikos. Eventually he left the club due to financial problems. In April 2011, after his departure from the club, newspapers claimed that the club still owes him \u20ac35,580. The player expected to take legal action. This means that if the club continues to prove inconsistent with the player could face a deduction of points. Already spokesman footballer Lakis Simeoforidis an ex-player and advocate, has informed EPO and Super League, in order to start all the necessary procedures and informing the Board of License Commission."

        "content": "OFI did not actually being among his first priorities, but the club gave him the opportunity to celebrate another promotion to the Greek Super League and put him in the football 'map' again. On 26 September 2010, he made his debut with the club in a 0\u20130 home draw against Kallithea. In January 2012, he scored the only goal with the club in a 3\u20131 away win against Panetolikos for the Greek Cup. He made 99 appearances in all competitions with the club scoring one goal. It seemed for long time that something's up with Bourbos and finally suspicions, took flesh and bones. Christos Bourbos filed an appeal to safeguard his salaries, which exceed \u20ac320,000! The player who has a contract with OFI Crete, tried to come to an agreement with the president of the club Manthos Poulinakis, but this never happened. The 30-year-old right-back, took the decision to make the appeal as \"I got tired of waiting and fooling him. The debts have to do with my presence in the club in the last three years, and each time, I did not take the money provided in my contract.\" the player said. In the 2013\u201314 season Bourbos was one of the best players of the club.  The blow is economical for OFI Crete and if the player is left free, the club loses a key member. The appeal of Bourbos added to that of Ricardo Ver\u00f3n, for a similar reason is clearly a big thorn for the club."

His unbeaten opponent, 25-0 Shannon Briggs was an amateur star and being touted as a future champ, he was the main feature of the card. In a huge upset,  Wilson took Briggs best shots in the opening rounds, turned the tide in the second, then knocked Briggs out for the full count in the third. This is considered by many to be the highlight of Wilson's career. Briggs for a while had the reputation to be \"chinny\" but wasn't knocked down by George Foreman, reputed by several sources to be among the greatest punchers in history. Later that year 1996, Wilson was brought back to HBO a fight later to meet another undefeated Top-prospect, the Samoan born, New Zealand Olympic bronze medallist David Tua, who had also won on the previous \"young heavys\" card. After two minutes of give-and-take the hard hitting Tua KO'ed Wilson in the first round with his lethal left hook. Wilson had lost, but was still a semi-attraction, and got his second chance when he met once-beaten South African Courage Tshabalala. The two staged one of the most famous fights of the year 1997. In the first round Courage dropped Wilson with a stiff left jab 25 seconds into the fight. Things looked even worse for Wilson when he was dropped again in the third, this time much harder, with a right hand. Courage tried to finish in the fourth but Wilson fought back with the heart he showed in the Briggs fight and leveled his opponent for the count."

Lewis was a tough and dangerous fighter with a respected right hand, however, the result was still a surprise. Wilson was no longer a fringe contender and dropped to journeyman status. Wilson was again TKO'ed in his next fight to the hard hitting contender and Olympic silver medallist David Izon. In that fight, Wilson's own power surfaced early, and Izon was dropped in the first round, but Wilson couldn't finish the job. Since then he slipped dramatically and never regained his old form. In 1999 he lost fights to Frankie Swindell and Zuri Lawrence, and was stopped in two rounds by the bigger and more experienced 2-time heavyweight champion Tim Witherspoon. Wilson dropped a ten-round decision to Jean-Francois Bergeron and Ray Mercer in 2005 and was stopped inside 4 rounds by Oliver McCall in 2006.

He went to school at Diocesan College, Rondebosch, where he appeared as King Lear in the school play in 1964. He originally thought of taking up the profession of painter, but returned to England to study acting at the Central School of Speech and Drama in the 1970s. After completing his drama education, he joined the repertory company Glasgow Citizens Theatre in Scotland."

        "content": "By 1990 Kent had formed an association with the Scottish actor Ian McDiarmid, and between 1990 and 2002 as joint artistic directors, they turned the Almeida into a major producing theatre. The success of this venture\u2014presenting a wide range of international plays\u2014led to 14 plays produced under Kent's tenure being transferred to the West End and also to Broadway. His productions for the Almeida included When We Dead Awaken; All for Love; Medea (also West End/Broadway); Chatsky; The Showman; The School for Wives; Gangster No 1; Tartuffe; The Life of Galileo; The Rules of the Game; Ivanov (also in Moscow); The Government Inspector; Naked (also West End); The Tempest; Hamlet (also Broadway); Richard II; Coriolanus (also New York/Tokyo); Ph\u00e8dre; Britannicus (also West End/New York); Plenty(West End); Lulu (also Washington); Platonov and King Lear.

In 2007 Kent was invited to become the artistic director of the Haymarket Theatre for one year, as a means of re-invigorating the West End theatre scene. He directed three plays:  William Wycherley's The Country Wife, Edward Bond's The Sea, and Marguerite, a musical based on La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias, with music by Michel Legrand and book by Alain Boublil He directed the Roundabout Theatre Company's Broadway production of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night with Jessica Lange at the American Airlines Theatre in 2016. The production won two 2016 Tony Awards, including Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Play.

        "title": "Jonathan Kent (director)_Opera director",
        "content": "Following his departure from the Almeida, Kent started directing operas. His operatic directing debut was during the Santa Fe Opera's 2003 season production of Katya Kabanova, a production received with great acclaim, as noted by Simon Williams in Opera News: \"Director Jonathan Kent is new to opera, having made his name in spoken drama in London. He displayed a natural feel for the dynamics and rhetoric of opera, and he directed with unwavering attention to the score. In short, this was an outstanding interpretation of a great modern tragedy\". His first British production was Michael Tippett's oratorio, A Child of Our Time in 2005. He returned that same year to Santa Fe for Mozart's Lucio Silla and again in 2006, when he directed the US premiere of Thomas Ad\u00e8s' The Tempest, which received significant critical acclaim. London's The Sunday Times critic, Hugh Canning wrote: Kent's production began with one of the most magical stage images I can recall in recent opera seasons. Paul Brown's permanent set is a sandy island with a pool of water representing the sea: in the prelude, a procession of fully clothed people (presumably the Neapolitan shipwreck survivors) walk out of the water like amphibious creatures, a dazzlingly surreal opening gambit in a production remarkable for its narrative clarity and observant delineation of character. Kent and Brown achieve an organic fusion of theatrical elements with the simplest of means. The dune-like 'island' provides opportunities for wittily surprising entrances \u2013 at one point, Ariel's head pops out of Prospero's magic cabinet \u2013 and perilous exits \u2013 the comic characters, Stefano and Trinculo, are swallowed up as if by quicksand. In Britain in 2006, Kent directed a new production of Puccini's Tosca for The Royal Opera, Covent Garden. Expectations were high, since this was Covent Garden's replacement for the famous Franco Zeffirelli production for Maria Callas in 1964, and which had been in use for 42 years. Kent \"believes Tosca, which Puccini adapted from a five-act French play, is an ideal vehicle for his talents: What I admire about it, quite apart from the thrilling music, is its theatre craft ... It's a taut, sinewy melodrama, exquisitely put together. There isn't an ounce of flesh on it ... That's what interested me: to find a way within that hurtling narrative to examine the relationships and its themes of sex, power and death. In 2007 Kent directed Richard Strauss' Elektra at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg and Benjamin Britten's The Turn of the Screw for the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in its 2007 season. He returned to Glyndebourne in 2009 to direct a new production of The Fairy-Queen with subsequent presentations in Caen, Paris and New York and Don Giovanni for the Festival and in 2012. His most recent production for Glyndebourne of Hippolyte et Aricie saw him reunited with William Christie following their successful collaboration with The Fairy-Queen internationally. He returned to the Santa Fe Opera in June 2008 to direct a new production of The Marriage of Figaro and again in 2009 when he directed the premiere of a new opera by Paul Moravec and Terry Teachout, The Letter based on Somerset Maugham's 1927 stage version of his short story of the same name. Kent made his debut at the English National Opera with Richard Wagner's The Flying Dutchman in 2012 before taking it to the Royal Danish Theatre, Copenhagen, the following year. His production for the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, Manon Lescaut, transferred to the Shanghai Opera House in 2013."

        "title": "T. Franklin Ahearn_Life and career",
        "content": "Ahearn was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the son of Thomas Ahearn and Lilias MacKay Fleck. His father was a prominent Ottawa citizen who owned Ottawa Electric and the Ottawa Electric Railway Company. He was educated at Kent Street Public School, Ottawa Collegiate and privately tutored. Around 1900, he organized the Buena Vista hockey team which played on an open-air rink at Laurier Avenue and Bronson, with an old streetcar for dressing facilities. In 1909, he married Norah Lewis, granddaughter of Archbishop John Travers Lewis and also of Sir Collingwood Schreiber. Thomas Franklin Ahearn served in World War I, as a captain in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, from 1914 until 1916, when he was injured and returned home. Mr. Ahearn became involved with the Ottawa Senators in the period when they won three Stanley Cups in four years between 1920 and 1923. In 1924, he bought out majority owner Tommy Gorman. In 1926-27, the Senators won the Cup with one of the most impressive rosters ever assembled. This imposing collection included Jack Adams, King Clancy, Alec Connell, Cy Denneny, Frank Finnigan, Hec Kilrea, Frank Nighbor and Hooley Smith. Winning the Stanley Cup was the last hurrah for the franchise. Due to a combination of the Great Depression and the smaller population of Ottawa, the club lost money every year after, leading the club to suspend operations for one year, move home games to other cities, and finally move to Missouri to operate as the St. Louis Eagles, and operated the Senators as an amateur/semi-professional senior club. After one season in St. Louis, the Ottawa owners sought to suspend operations again and were turned down by the league. Finally, on October 15, 1935, the Eagles and their players were bought out by the NHL, dispersing the players to other NHL teams and suspending the franchise, with a promise to pass along the proceeds if the franchise was resold. (The franchise would be reinstated eventually in 1992) In the years of his owning the Ottawa Senators, his losses were over $200,000, a loss he said he never regretted. At the time of the dissolution of the NHL franchise, Ahearn was a minority owner of the consortium which owned the Ottawa Auditorium arena and the Senators. Like his father, Ahearn was involved in politics, and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 1930 and 1935. Ahearn was a vice-president of the Ottawa Light, Heat and Power Company. In 1940, he resigned to become president of the Ottawa Electric Company. He also had his own firm, Rowatt-Ahearn Ltd. and became president of the Ottawa Electric Railway Company in 1938 after his father died. Ahearn also had interests in several other Ottawa businesses including Wallace Realty Company, the Ottawa Car Manufacturing Company, the Ottawa Gas Company, the Ottawa Investment Company, Ahearn & Soper and other businesses. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962 as a builder. He was inducted into the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame in 1966. Ahearn died in 1962 at his home at 7 Rideau Gate, Ottawa, and was interred in Beechwood Cemetery. He was survived by his wife Norah, son Thomas Trevor, and daughters Joan and Lilias."

        "content": "While stats for Thompson's career in terms of wins and losses were not officially measured until his last year in 1950, he is reported to have made 46 starts with 99 total game appearances. After a forgettable season to start his career in 1940 with Pittsburgh, he ended up playing with cross-town team Philadelphia. The first two seasons spent with Philadelphia were miserable, as the Eagles won two games each, while he was an off-and-on starter. Upon his return to the Eagles in 1945, the fortunes of the team had improved, as they won at least six games and finished at least third in each year, buoyed by Thompson and Steve Van Buren, who would eventually be named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In the three year run for the Eagles to three straight NFL championship appearances from 1947 to 1949, Thompson would throw for 57 total touchdowns while Van Buren would run for 34 touchdowns. In 1947 and 1948, he would lead the league in passer rating, and his 25 touchdowns in the latter year was a league high: he was just the second quarterback to lead the league in consecutive years in the category (after Ed Danowski) and just the fourth to lead the league multiple times (after Danoswki, Sid Luckman, and Sammy Baugh). In 1947, the Eagles won eight of twelve games and wound up tied with Pittsburgh in the division, meaning a tiebreaker game was required to determine who would play in the NFL Championship Game Thompson was the starting quarterback for the Eagles in the game, and went 11-of-17 for 131 yards and two touchdowns. His 15-yard score to Steve Van Buren in the first quarter proved to be the winning score, as the Eagles went on to shut out the Steelers 21-0. For the 1947 NFL Championship Game, there was no primary starter at quarterback on either team, although Thompson did play. Facing the Chicago Cardinals, he threw 27-of-44 passes for 297 yards for one touchdown and three interceptions. The game was mostly even-matched in passing and rushing, but the Cardinals started with a 14-0 lead by the time the Eagles ended up getting on the board, and after that they traded scores as the Cardinals held on to win 28-21, after having possession for the last five minutes. The following year, he helped lead the Eagles to another division crown. On December 19, in the 1948 NFL Championship Game, he would partake in one of the most famous weather games, as snow rained down on Shibe Park that made running an even more important commodity: each team combined for over 300 yards on the ground to just 42 passing. Facing the Cardinals once again, he went 2-of-12 for 7 yards and two interceptions while running for 50 yards on 11 carries. However, Steve Van Buren would win the game on a touchdown run early in the fourth quarter to give the Eagles the one and only score needed to win Philadelphia's first championship, with Thompson and Van Buren each getting credit from coach Greasy Neale for the win. In 1949, the Eagles were even better, losing just one game as Thompson and the team would make it to a third consecutive NFL Championship Game. Facing the upstart Los Angeles Rams on a mudpit, he threw for 5-of-9 for 68 yards with one touchdown and one interception. His 31 yard touchdown to Pete Pihos in the second quarter was both the longest pass he threw all day and the winning score as the Eagles shut out the Rams 14-0. Thompson closed his career in 1950 with a 6-6 record, having thrown for 1,608 yards with 11 touchdowns to 22 interceptions. One highlight included him becoming the fourth quarterback to ever throw for 10,000 yards in a career: for context, he finished fourth in passing yards all-time, behind Sammy Baugh, Sid Luckman and Otto Graham, all of whom were later inducted into the Hall of Fame. In the seven decades that have followed since Thompson retired, he fell from 4th to 193rd, a reflection of the growing trend in passing. Thompson is one of four eligible inactive NFL quarterbacks with multiple championships who have not yet been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, along with Jim Plunkett, Tobin Rote, and Jack Kemp. Ray Didinger of CSNPhilly ranked him in the Top 5 all-time Eagles quarterbacks, citing his contribution to the championship teams. In 1953, Thompson made a brief return to football by playing with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers while serving as their backfield coach. He only played three games with them."

He became the Admiral of the Genoese Fleet in 1555 and commanded the combined Christian fleet of the Holy League at the Battle of Djerba in 1560, which was won by the Ottoman Turks under the command of Piyale Pasha. He barely escaped with his life as his troops suffered a crushing defeat, the stress and shame supposedly caused the older Andrea Doria to die. He also participated in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, commanding the right wing of the Christian coalition force known as the Holy League. During the battle he allowed a gap to be formed in the Holy League's battle line which was exploited by Occhiali. Many historians have criticized Doria for opening the line, some going so far as to describe it as an act of cowardice. The battle was ultimately won by the Holy League, and signaled the first ever defeat of the Ottoman Turks at sea. Doria would go on to write reports attempting to justify his actions at the battle. Using the momentum from the Battle of Lepanto, Don John and Doria would go on to capture Tunis in 1573. Doria also led an expedition against the Barbary states in 1601. Doria was a knight commander of the Order of Santiago. He was also the Marquis of Tursi and 6th (or 2nd) Prince of Melfi (both titles inherited from his relation and adoptive father, the famed Genoese admiral Andrea Doria)."

        "content": "Rachel Stainer was born in Islington. After her father Tom died in World War I, the family moved to Newbury, Berkshire. After an \"impulsive and unsuccessful wartime liaison\", in 1947 she moved to Vienna to work with the Four Power Commission, and married the journalist Antony Terry. Terry was German correspondent for the Sunday Times, and the marriage \"fell victim to his workload\". Stainer never returned to England, living in Berlin, Bonn and Trieste before returning to Vienna. In 1956 Cyril Ray helped secure her a job as Central and Eastern Europe Correspondent for The Spectator, making a plea that she needed the money. Writing as Sarah Gainham (the name of her maternal great-grandmother), she reported on Germany and the German-speaking parts of Central Europe until 1966. She soon published her first novel, Time Right Deadly (1956), a semi-autobiographical account of an unsuccessful affair. The novel was followed by several other spy thrillers set in Europe. Here Gainham drew on her own knowledge of Cold War spies and intrigues: Terry, hired to the Sunday Times by Ian Fleming, may have been an MI6 agent, and Gainham herself apparently researched a document 'East-West Routes for Agents', commissioned by Fleming, on how to gain access to West Berlin from East Berlin. In 1964 her marriage to Terry was dissolved, and she married Kenneth Ames, Central European correspondent of The Economist. Night Falls on the City (1967), a tale of love and betrayal set in wartime Vienna, achieved significant commercial success: it topped the New York Times bestseller list for several months, and was widely translated. It was the first novel of a trilogy, completed by A Place in the Country (1969) and Private Worlds (1971), and gave her financial security. In 1975 Ames committed suicide, leaving Gainham alone in later life. In 1976 she moved from Vienna to a small house in Petronell-Carnuntum, on the banks of the Danube, and became a somewhat eccentric recluse. Her last novel was the heavily autobiographical but unsuccessful The Tiger, Life (1983). In 1984 she was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. A Discursive Essay on the Presentation of Recent History in England was privately published in 1999."

His early work, this film included, were very much in the Italian neorealist style; many were social dramas that dealt with contemporary issues pertaining to people of Sicilian heritage. Through the years, Germi shifted away from social drama towards satirical comedies, but retained his loved element of the Sicilian people.  In the 1960s, Germi received worldwide success with the films Divorce Italian Style, Seduced and Abandoned, and The Birds, the Bees and the Italians.  He was nominated for Academy Awards in both directing and writing for Divorce Italian Style, and, subsequently, won in the writing category.  He also won the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival for The Birds, the Bees and the Italians. His 1968 film Serafino won the Golden Prize at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival.

While she primarily writes in Spanish, she is fluent in English, German, and French, having worked as a translator for several years. She has traveled extensively and lived in various Central American countries and Europe. The pluralities of these cultural and geographical fusions manifest themselves in her literary production and intellectual thought. Her novel, A-B-Sudario (Alfaguara, 2003), was awarded the Mario Monteforte Toledo Central American Prize for Fiction (Premio Centroamericano de Novela Mario Monteforte Toledo). She has also received residencies by La Maison des \u00c9crivains \u00c9trangers et des Traducteurs in Saint-Nazaire, France and Heinrich B\u00f6ll Haus in Langenbroich, Germany. Although a prolific author with many publications, the majority of Escudos's work remains unpublished. Despite the often limited means of literary circulation in Central America, some of Escudos's unpublished work has nonetheless been recognized. In 2002, for instance, Escudos won a national contest in El Salvador, the Tenth Annual Literary Contest of Ahuachap\u00e1n (D\u00e9cimos Juegos Florales de Ahuachap\u00e1n) for her book, Cr\u00f3nicas para sentimentales. Escudos's narrative voice engages with experimental forms and techniques. This experimentation is intentional, one that structures and situates her work through the opening of possibilities in relationship to selfhood and space. This narrative voice and its relationship to other literary maps is demonstrated in Escudos's current participation in the blogosphere. Her official blog, Jacintario, is a regularly updated medium\u2013\u2013an extension of Escudos's writing that operates as a daily form of expression where the author's voice, and content, varies. As an online cultural magazine, Jacintario contributes to the blogosphere not simply because it is a production by an eminent literary figure, but because of the immediacy and access the blog offers in relationship to a genre in the making."

From 1993 to 1995, he played for Platense, alongside French-Argentine David Trezeguet. He won three Argentine titles during his time with River Plate. In 2002, during the Argentine great depression, Coudet was one of many players to move abroad, in his case to RC Celta de Vigo in Spain's La Liga. He said of life in his country \"I can't live any more over here. It's terrible to experience every day with this sense of unease. You brake at a light and you don't know if they're going to wash your windscreen, ask for an autograph or stick a bullet through your head\", and had chosen a cheaper car to avoid bringing attention to his wealth. After several years playing in Mexico, Coudet returned to Argentina in January 2010 to play for Col\u00f3n de Santa Fe. Coudet eventually became a trialist for the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer and later signed with the club in July 2010. He was released by the club in February 2011. On 28 March 2011, Coudet signed with Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the North American Soccer League.

Aiming to reinforce the squad, Coudet contacted various ex-Central players, including Marco Ruben, Cristian Villagra (both playing in Ukraine at the time) and Cesar Delgado, convincing them to join for the coming 2015 season. Among others, Coudet also managed to sign defender Pablo \u00c1lvarez and midfielders Jos\u00e9 Luis Fern\u00e1ndez and Gustavo Colman. Coudet's official debut began with a surprise 1\u20130 win away to reigning champions Racing. Central followed up this win with four consecutive victories. Coudet's side had a 13-game undefeated streak until an eventual 2\u20130 loss away to River Plate. Central bounced back quickly, inflicting on rivals Newell's an unprecedented fourth consecutive derby loss.  Coudet's team finished 2015 in third place, and narrowly missed out on the 2014\u201315 Copa Argentina championship after a controversial 2\u20130 final loss to Boca Juniors, after a dubious penalty decision and an offside goal put the tie beyond reach."

He was born in Frankfurt am Main (in modern-day Germany), where he studied business. Sommer opened his first photography studio in Switzerland, where he made relief images of mountains for the Swiss government. In 1856 moved his business to Naples and later (1866) formed a partnership with fellow German photographer Edmund Behles (also known as Edmondo Behles) who owned a studio in Rome. Operating from their respective Naples and Rome studios, Sommer and Behles became one of the largest and most prolific photography concerns in Italy."

In April 1872, he documented a very large eruption of Mount Vesuvius in a series of stunning photographs. Sommer and Behles exhibited extensively and earned numerous honors and prizes for their work (London 1862, Paris 1867, Vienna 1873, Nuremberg 1885). At one time, Sommer was appointed official photographer to King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. Sommer was involved in every aspect of the photography business. He published his own images that he sold in his studios and to customers across Europe. In later years, he photographed custom images for book illustrations, as well as printing his own albums and postcards. Sommer worked in all the popular formats of his day: carte de visite, stereoview, and large albumen prints (approximately 8x10) which were sold individually and in bound albums. The partnership with Behles ended in 1874, after which each photographer continued his own business. In Naples, Sommer opened a total of four additional studios: at No. 4 and No. 8 Monte di Dio, No. 5 Magazzino S. Caterina, and a last at Piazza della Vittoria. Sommer died in Naples in 1914."

        "content": "Yi Seung-Hun (1756 \u2013 April 8, 1801, Ja: Jasul (\u5b50\u8ff0), Ho: Mancheon, baptismal name Peter) was one of the first Roman Catholic martyrs in Korea. He was born in 1756 in Seoul. His father was Soam Yi Dong-uk (\u8607\u5dd6 \u674e\u6771\u90c1, 1739-?) from the Pyeongchang clan.  who rose to the rank of champan (vice-minister) and, after possible initial interest, fiercely opposed the spread of Catholic teachings. His mother was a sister of Yi Ga-hwan (\u674e\u5bb6\u7165, 1742-1801), one of the Catholics executed with him in 1801. Yi Seung-hun first came into contact with Catholicism via Yi Byeok in 1779. In 1783-4, he accompanied his father on a diplomatic mission to Beijing, China, and on the suggestion of Yi Byeok contacted the Catholic priests there. He was baptised in Beijing in the spring of 1784. This was the first time that a member of the Korean yangban class was formally baptised as a Christian and he returned to Korea with books, crucifixes, and other Catholic artifacts. Yi Byeok then seems to have taken some time to study the books before declaring himself convinced. He then set about evangelizing those around him, including Gwon Cheol-sin and his younger brother Gwon Il-sin. This was also the moment when he spoke of the Catholic faith to the brothers Jeong Yak-jong, Jeong Yak-jeon, and Jeong Yak-Yong (who recorded the event in his epitaph myojimyeong. It was only after Yi Byeok felt fully convinced that he authorized Yi Seung-hun to baptise himself and the other converts to Catholicism. Early in 1785 the growing group of believers and sympathizers in Seoul moved their regular gatherings for worship from the house of Yi Byeok to that belonging to another convert, Kim Beom-u, on the hill where Myeongdong Cathedral now stands. Almost immediately the authorities raided the house, suspecting it of being a gambling den, and were embarrassed on finding it full of nobles. Yi Seung-hun was among those named in the official report of the incident. After the death of Yi Byeok later that year, Yi Seung-hun took over his role in the group. In the spring of 1786, as there were yet no formally ordained priests in Korea, Various leading Korean laymen, including Choi Chang-Hyon, Yi Tan-won, began acting as \"temporary clerics\". In 1789, however, the Korean Catholics were informed by the bishop in Beijing, Mgr. Gouvea, that such practices were contrary to Church teachings and that they should cease. There would be no ordained priest in Korea until 1795, when the Chinese priest Zhu Wenmiao arrived, at which time the Church had grown to over 4000 members. Yi Seung-hun and Jeong Yak-jong were the main leaders of the community in Seoul after the death of Yi Byeok in 1786. Yi Seung-hun's wife was Jeong Yak-jong's sister. In 1801, the Korean Catholic Church was subject to the first major repression by the government (the Sinyu Persecution) in which more than 300 people were killed. Yi was martyred by beheading on the 26th of the 2nd lunar month (April 8), 1801. This incident has come to be known as the Catholic Persecution of 1801. Little written material remains from this period but a collection of texts by several of the first believers, known as Mancheon yugo (\u8513\u5ddd\u907a\u7a3f), was discovered in about 1970. Mancheon was the ho of Yi Seung-hun, whose writings occupy a major part of the book, together with texts written by Yi Byeok etc. It is not known when or by whom the collection was made, and although it is sometimes claimed to be in the handwriting of Jeong Yak-yong, this does not seem to be the case."

He didn't seek his first nomination. He was pressed by families and neighbors to let his name stand. In the provincial general election of 1948 he ran as a \"Liberal-Progressive Conservative\" candidate, having been nominated by a joint constituency convention of the two parties. Soon after he took a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, he devoted his political career solely to the Liberal Party and ran successfully as a Liberal Candidate for the constituency of Moosomin in the general elections of 1952, 1956, 1960 and 1964. During his career in provincial politics, Hammy McDonald rose rapidly in prominence in public life and within the Liberal Party. In 1954, he became the leader of the Liberal Party in Saskatchewan, a position which he held for five years until 1959. An article describing the career of Mr. McDonald in this context noted, \"The swift and dazzling rise of 37-year-old Alexander Hamilton McDonald to the leadership of the Liberal Party in Saskatchewan has no parallel in Canadian political history.\" From 1955 to 1960, he was the Leader of the Opposition. Hammy McDonald continued to hold responsible positions within the Liberal Party after his tenure as leader of the party. In the years 1964 to 1965 Hammy served as Minister of Agriculture and Deputy Premier to Premier Ross Thatcher. He resigned his seat in 1965 and later that year was appointed to the Senate of Canada representing the senatorial division of Moosomin, Saskatchewan. A Liberal, he was Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate (appointed in 1968) and Government Whip in the Senate (appointed in 1970). Throughout his parliamentary career, Hammy was active in the affairs of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the International Parliamentary Union and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. He took part in community activities as a member of the Royal Canadian Legion, the United Services Institute and the Elks Lodge. Hammy McDonald died in office in 1980. His funeral \u2013 held at the United Church in Moosomin, Saskatchewan \u2013 was overflowing with dignitaries from Ottawa, the provinces and many, many locals from within the constituency. He was remembered with real affection and was genuinely liked by both sides of the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly. His honorary pallbearers included two Members elected under the NDP banner."

According to Antonino Calderone, the first Mafia family in Catania was started by Antonio Saitta. He had been prosecuted by Mussolini\u2019s Iron Prefect, Cesare Mori. One of his daughters was the mother of Giuseppe and Antonino Calderone. Another uncle had helped the Mafia get back on its feet after World War II, organizing the black market in contraband cigarettes. Antonino Calderone, narrating his initiation ritual in Catania in 1962, recalls that he was surprised to see at the gathering people he knew and he never suspected were in the Mafia, and not to see people he thought were in the organization. Calderone owned a gas station and entered profitable business ventures thanks to his Mafia connections, and rose through the ranks of the Calderone family until he became underboss of the Catania Mafia. On September 8, 1978, his brother and boss of the Catania Mafia, Giuseppe Calderone, was killed by his former close friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nitto Santapaola. Santapaola had forged an alliance with the Corleonesi and took over the command of the Catania Mafia Family. This was the beginning of a campaign of violence targeting the established Sicilian Mafia families which culminated in the 1981 killing of Stefano Bontade, a close ally and personal friend of the Calderone brothers, which led to the Second Mafia War. Calderone became more and more marginalized and decided to leave Catania in 1983 fearing for his life. With his wife and three children he moved to Nice in France, where he ran a Laundromat. On May 9, 1986, he was arrested in Nice."

Calderone was moved to an insane asylum for his own protection. On April 9, 1987, Falcone \u2013 together with French prosecutor Michel Debaq sat face to face with Calderone in a Marseille prison. After an initial refusal to talk, Calderone suddenly said, \"I know a lot about the Mafia, because I am a member of it.\" Once he started, Calderone talked for almost a year. Falcone flew once a week to Marseille, taking some 1,000 pages of deposition from Calderone. Calderone proved to be a remarkably accurate witness. More than 800 details were checked.

He testified about the relationship between the Mafia and the four Cavalieri del Lavoro (Knights of Labour) of Catania: the construction entrepreneurs Carmelo Costanzo, Francesco Finocchiaro, Mario Rendo and Gaetano Graci \u2013 who needed the mafiosi for protection. Construction sites of rival companies were bombed and at least one rival of Costanzo was assassinated. Calderone also talked about the links of Cosa Nostra with law enforcement, freemasonry, judges and politicians in Catania and the Italian government. \"We in Catania, when we had a problem with the judiciary, we would turn to the local Masonic head. We knew that many magistrates were lodge members and that, thanks to the local chief, we could even interfere with ongoing criminal proceedings,\" Calderone said. The Catanese Mafia was generally able to learn about arrest warrants before they were issued and sometimes have names crossed off the list. When they needed a false passport they turned to \u2018their\u2019 member of parliament in Rome, Giuseppe Lupis of the small Democratic Socialist Party. Lupis was one of the top vote-getters in Catania. According to Calderone the late 1970s were a turning point in the relationship between the Mafia and politics. The Mafia started to feel superior and politicians could not refuse requests for favours."

While they expressed no regret for their crimes, Calderone seemed to suffer from genuine remorse. As the brother of a Commission member, Calderone knew a lot about the workings of Cosa Nostra and confirmed the essential role of the Commission in the major assassinations of the 1970s and 1980s. He provided first-hand accounts of the leaders of the Corleonesi, Luciano Leggio, Tot\u00f2 Riina and Bernardo Provenzano. \"The Corleone bosses were not educated at all, but they were cunning and diabolical,\" Calderone said about Riina and Provenzano. \"They were both clever and ferocious, a rare combination in Cosa Nostra.\" One of the more bizarre anecdotes Calderone related in his memoirs was that of Riina giving a tearful eulogy at the funeral of his murdered brother, even though Riina himself had ordered the killing. Yet, Riina's admiration for Giuseppe Calderone might have been sincere: he regretted having to have him killed, just as a president of a company regrets having to lay off a valued employee during difficult economic times. Calderone\u2019s most explosive revelation was about Salvo Lima, prime minister Giulio Andreotti\u2019s chief lieutenant in Sicily, and the Salvo cousins, wealthy tax collectors on the island. He described how he and his brother conferred with Lima and the Salvo cousins to get a zealous police officer in Catania transferred."

After the murder of Giovanni Falcone, Calderone gave a little noticed but accurate analysis of the attack: \"Such a spectacular public bombing is never in the interest of the Mafia \u2026 it is a sign of weakness.\" The killing had become necessary because of a series of major defeats, according to Calderone. \"Falcone had been condemned to death a long time ago, but the sentence could no longer be put off for two reasons: the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to confirm the life sentences of the bosses of the Commission \u2026 and the increasing certainty that Falcone would be super-prosecutor. As long as convictions could be overturned in Rome, there was no need to act. But a definitive life sentence unleashed a reaction of rage. The Corleonesi and the winning families lost their heads.\" He went on to predict that other killings would soon follow: \"Cosa Nostra has a little book and for every name there is a time.\""

        "title": "Pietro della Vecchia_Life",
        "content": "The life of Pietro della Vecchia is not very well documented and the information available is not always reliable.  He is believed to have been born in Vicenza in 1603 as the son of Gasparo della Vecchia, who was a painter admitted to the Venetian painters guild.  Some art historians place the artist's place of birth in Venice.  Pietro della Vecchia was erroneously called Pietro Muttoni after Luigi Lanzi in the first edition of his Storia pittorica della Italia (1796), mixed up the artist's name with that of a Muttoni collection, which kept one of his paintings.  Later authors interpreted de la Vecchia (meaning 'of the old') as a nickname as the artist liked to imitate the old masters of the previous century.  Pietro was in fact a scion of a well-known Venetian family called 'Dalla Vecchia'. Early sources describe Alessandro Varotari, called il Padovanino, as his teacher.  On stylistic grounds some art historians have expressed doubt on this traineeship in his early years.  The influence of the works of Padovanino is only visible after 1635.  So he may have worked with Padovanino at a later stage.  His earliest known work show a strong influence by Carlo Saraceni and Saraceni's pupil and collaborator Jean Leclerc.  This is an important indication that della Vecchia trained with them. As his work displayed for some time certain Caravaggesque characteristics it is believed that he spent time in Rome after the departure of Leclerc from Venice in 1621 or 1622.  Della Vecchia probably worked in Padovanino's workshop after his return from Rome in 1625 or 1626.  Padovanino, whose style was strongly rooted in early-16th-century Venetian art, likely played an important role in instilling in della Vecchia a great interest in 16th-century painting in Venice and the Veneto. The first documents in which the name of della Vecchia appears date back to the period from December 1626 to January 1628.  The documents deal with the payment for a banner the artist had made for the Confraternity of the Carmelites in the church of S. Marco in Pordenone. From 1629 to 1640 he was a member of the guild of painters in Venice.  In 1626 he married Clorinda R\u00e9gnier (or Clorinda Renieri), a daughter of the Flemish painter Nicolas R\u00e9gnier (or Renieri). Clorinda R\u00e9gnier was a painter in her own right and has been described as \"a woman of great spirit, of great stature and of great adherence\" (Tommaso Temanza, 1738).  Lucrezia R\u00e9gnier, the elder sister of della Vecchia's wife was married to Daniel van den Dyck, a Flemish painter active in Northern Italy.  Della Vecchia, together with his brother-in-law Daniel van den Dyck and their respective spouses, painted wall decorations in the Palazzo Pesaro in Preganziol. Towards the end of the 1630s della Vecchia had established his name as one of the leading painters of Venice, especially of religious works.  In January 1640 the procurators of S. Marco de Supra, responsible for the decoration of St Mark's Basilica, commissioned from him two cartoons for mosaics.  These appear to have been well received as della Vecchia was subsequently appointed Venice's \"pitor ducal\" (painter to the duke), a position he held until 1674, that is, until four years before his death.  In this capacity he was responsible for the design of the new mosaics and the restoration of the old ones in the Basilica.  Della Vecchia also received a commission to restore Giorgione's Castelfranco Madonna altarpiece in 1643-1644. At the height of his career, della Vecchia was a very sought-after teacher with a large workshop employing many assistants.  Della Vecchia also opened an academy in his house where live drawing classes were organised.  Gregorio Lazzarini was one of his pupils probably shortly after 1667.  Gregorio Lazzarini was later the teacher of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.  Della Vecchia also taught classes on the theory of art. Della Vecchia enjoyed fame as a connoisseur of ancient drawings and paintings.  Especially during the latter part of his life he was repeatedly consulted by collectors and merchants, often together with his father-in-law Nicolas R\u00e9gnier. Both he and his father-in-law had business relations with Paolo del Sera, who was the art agent in Venice of Leopoldo de' Medici, an Italian cardinal, scholar, patron of the arts and the Governor of Siena.  Marco Boschini, an engraver, art dealer and author who was a great admirer of della Vecchia, often joined the artist when he was asked to value paintings after 1670. Della Vecchia was close to the humanistic and libertine circle around the Accademia degli Incogniti (Academy of the Unknowns), a learned society of freethinking intellectuals, mainly noblemen, that significantly influenced the cultural and political life of mid-17th-century Venice.  Many of the subjects of his works were a reflection of the intellectual occupations of this influential Venetian society.  For instance the charged eroticism in the Young couple is likely linked to the libertine attitudes of the Accademia. His son Gasparo Prospero was born on 8 May 1653 and became a minor painter, musician, music theoretician and mathematician.  Pietro della Vecchia also had four daughters one of whom died young. Della Vecchia died on 8 September 1678 in Venice and was buried in the church of S. Canciano."

        "content": "Della Vecchia was a versatile and prolific painter who worked in many genres and created altarpieces, portraits, genre scenes and grotesques.  He relied on the assistance of a large workshop, which explains his large output as well as the fact that many of his works are known in multiple versions.  He dated his religious paintings but not his other works, which makes it difficult to understand the evolution of the artist in these other genres. During his career the artist worked in a variety of artistic styles and absorbed many influences including from contemporary artists as well as artists from the previous century.  He combined in his work the monumentality of the 16th century Venetian art of artists such as Titian and Tintoretto with the dramatic effects of the style of the Caravaggisti.  In line with the Venetian Baroque his works tend to push the sentiments of the depicted figures to the extreme.  This penchant for exaggeration, even the grotesque, was central to della Vecchia's mature style and was influential on other artists.  The artist developed a unique style, which was characterised by its pursuit of artistic virtuosity, and often depicted subject matter which was unusual and esoteric.  These feature explains the high demand for his work by the more discerning Venetian collectors of his time. His earliest known works include two representations of Saint Francis, which display clear Caravaggesque tendencies.  Some paintings of this early period show an affinity with those of an anonymous artist likely of French origin, the so-called Candelight Master, who can perhaps be identified with Trophime Bigot.  It is assumed that during his presumed stay in Rome from 1621/2 to 1626 he may have been in contact with French followers of Caravaggio active in Rome such as Trophime Bigot and Claude Vignon. The first dated work by della Vecchia is the Calvary in the church of San Lio in Venice, and is dated 1633:  It still shows the influence of Carlo Saraceni and Jean Leclerc, his presumed masters. The influence of Bernardo Strozzi becomes noticeable in his work after 1630.  This is apparent in the Angel Offering a Skull to St Giustina, who stands between St Joseph and St John (1640, Accademia, Venice) painted for the church of San Giustina. From 1640 to 1673 he painted designs for some the mosaic depictions inside the St. Mark's Basilica.  A development towards greater drama was visible after 1650.  The works of that time draw again on the Caravaggesque models he followed at the start of his career.  The apex of this evolution is apparent in the two remaining works of the cycle of seven paintings that the artist executed between 1664 and 1674 for the second cloister of the Jesuit church in Venice.  The paintings represent the Conversion of Francis Borgia (Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Brest) and Marco Gussoni in the Ferrara lazaretto (location unknown).  The macabre themes, the effects of spectral lights and the suffocating lack of space in the compositions are unique in Venetian painting of the seventeenth century, comparable only with the morbid paintings of the Milanese or Neapolitan schools. After this cycle his later paintings appear without inspiration and derivative from the painter's earlier works.  Of greater interest are some historical paintings of this period, which show in the bold brushstrokes and the bright and dazzling palette the influence of the leading 17th-century Venetian painter Francesco Maffei, who died in 1660. Other works of his later period show the influence of Giambattista Langetti and the group of tenebrosi active in Venice around 1660. Della Vecchia had a notable interest in Venetian masters including Titian and Giorgione. This interest was likely nurtured during a stay as an assistant in the workshop of Padovanino. For his skill in imitating the works of Giorgione, his friend Marco Boschini coined for him the nickname 'simia da Zorzon', meaning 'ape of Giorgione'.  Giorgione was called Zorzon in the Venetian dialect. According to Boschini, della Vecchia abused of his skill in imitating the older Venetian masters.  Boschini recounts that when the art dealer Francesca Fontana was assembling a collection for Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici he was given a 'Giorgione self-portrait'.  This portrait was actually an imitation by della Vecchia painted from his own features.  When the deceit was discovered, della Vecchia claimed he was solely trying to emulate Giorgione and that he had produced the work 30 years earlier for his father-in-law Nicolas R\u00e9gnier.  Nicolas R\u00e9gnier, who  was not only a painter but also an art dealer, had sold the painting.  Thirty years later, it was believed that the work was in fact a genuine Giorgione.  It appears therefore that della Vecchia's imitations could very well be regarded in certain cases as attempts to pass off the imitations as originals.  His friend Boschini regarded these imitations, often executed in a remarkably ingenious manner, as displays of virtuosity. Other artists whose works della Vecchia and his workshop regularly imitated included Titian, Romanino, Palma Vecchio, Paris Bordone and Jacopo Bassano.  His imitations of Giorgione offer an important insight into the manner in which that artist's work was perceived in the 17th century.  It is believed that none of della Vecchia's works in the style of Giorgione were based on now lost compositions of Giorgione but were 'original' creations in the style of Giorgione. Della Vecchia was known for his paintings of soldiers (referred to as 'bravi') with broad feathered hats of which he made many versions and variations.  Some of these paintings depict individual soldiers while others show soldiers in genre scenes such as fortune telling, playing dice etc.  The innumerable repetitions of these works depicting warriors and other popular figures created by his workshop had a negative impact on his posthumous reputation.  Della Vecchia painted not only imaginary portraits of bravos, but also of philosophers, pages and courtesans. These portraits are an expression of the Venetian Baroque's taste for eccentric subject matter.  They also represent the artist's reaction to the expressive head portraits (tronies) by Caravaggio and Rembrandt. There are about eight pictures by della Vecchia in which the landscape is the primary subject. These include four idyllic landscapes that presage the Rococo style (now in the Pinacoteca Querini-Stampalia) and the Rocky Landscape with Warriors in the Hermitage.  Two further landscapes were auctioned at Dorotheum on 20 October 2015 as lot 279.  These latter works are executed in a painterly technique, reminiscent of the 'picturesque' style of late 16th-century artists Titian and Jacopo Bassano. The two compositions likely do not depict a particular story, but are rather an evocation of a romanticised wild countryside, frequented by intrepid warriors wearing fantastic costumes. Della Vecchia maintained close links with the members of the Accademia degli Incogniti.  Their philosophical occupations were reflected in the iconography of some of his paintings of the 1650s and 1660s. In some works he treated the mathematical, philosophical and cabalistic ideas in a serious manner and in others he ridiculed them through salacious images.  For example in the Allegory of architecture (1654, Accademia Carrara di Belle Arti di Bergamo), which depicts a half-naked woman crouched over a book on a ledge with an old man and another half-naked woman seeming to beseech her, he gives expression to some of those ideas."

He was born in Santiago, Chile, the son of the Basque Domingo Eyzaguirre Escutasolo and of Mar\u00eda Rosa de Arechavala y Alday.  He studied in the seminary of his native City, and showed remarkable aptitude for mathematics and chemistry. When scarcely nineteen years old he was appointed as assayer of the royal mint of Santiago, but resigned the next year, and devoted himself entirely to the cultivation of a farm near Santiago, inherited from his father. There his labors tended more to the improvement of the condition of the laboring classes than to his own pecuniary interest. He improved the yield of some of the poorest lands by his knowledge of chemistry, introduced modern agricultural implements, and, by giving his laborers better than the accustomed wages and caring for their moral and material welfare, soon assembled a colony of well to do and contented people. He also introduced looms, which, although imperfect, served to weave from native wool the coarse cloth worn by the peasantry. From the first years of his country life he agitated the project of a canal to water the barren plain surrounding Santiago, which had been begun some time before, but was abandoned. The Spanish government approved the plan, and in 1802 made Eyzaguirre director. He pushed the work with energy until it was interrupted by the revolution of 1810, and notwithstanding he sympathized with the patriotic cause, he abstained from any participation. His prestige as an honorable and impartial man was so great that, even when his brothers were exiled, he suffered no persecution from the Spanish authorities, and was enabled to alleviate the sufferings of his compatriots. When the independence of Chile was finally established in 1817, he resumed his favorite work, and in 1820, amid great festivities, the canal of Maipo was opened. This, with many smaller lateral canals, soon converted the arid plain into a fertile garden. It was placed by the government under the administration of a board, of which Eyzaguirre was appointed president. In 1823 he was commissioned to reorganize the charitable institutions, and undertook the task of building a home for wayfarers and needy persons. Within a few years he had collected the necessary means, and a new and commodious building was erected. In 1835 he was appointed first governor of the department of Victoria, the capital of which he had founded and spent a good part of his fortune in improving. He established the agricultural society in 1838, and was elected its president. He was several times deputy to the National congress, where he soon became noted for his honesty. In 1845 he attempted to establish a socialistic colony in the country, where all should share the labor and produce, but soon dissensions broke out, and the project failed. A few years later he undertook to establish a large cloth factory, with the object of improving the condition of the poor and giving occupation to women and children. In this enterprise he invested the greater part of his fortune, but before the factory was finished he died. The Maipo canal board erected a statue to his memory."

Webster did not play many tournaments in 2008, instead choosing to remain in college to earn his plumbing degree. He did though retain the WDF Europe Cup, beating Northern Ireland's Daryl Gurney in the final. Webster also had a great run into the quarter finals of the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts. After surprisingly losing his opening group game to Colin McGarry, he went on to whitewash Michael van Gerwen 5\u20130 and despite losing to Mervyn King, Webster went through to the knockout stages on leg difference after McGarry failed to beat van Gerwen.

Having beaten Martin Atkins, he lost to wildcard entrant Henny van der Ster who claimed the quarter final spot ahead of Webster and went on to reach the semi-finals. Webster entered the 2009 BDO World Championship as the number two seed.

After the UK Open his poor floor form returned in which he failed to progress past the last 32 in any event until the 2010 World Matchplay Darts in which he knocked out seventh seed Adrian Lewis 11\u20139 in the first round but was beaten 13\u20139 by Co Stomp\u00e9 This earned him \u00a37,500 towards the order of merit. His next major event was the 2010 Championship League Darts which he qualified for due to his order of merit ranking of 29 which put him into the last group \u2013 8. He qualified from the group stage in fourth with wins over Jelle Klaasen, Michael van Gerwen, Dennis Priestley and Denis Ovens this meant that he played group winner Co Stomp\u00e9 in the semi-final in which he prevailed 6\u20133 however he was beaten 6\u20132 by Wayne Jones in the group final. After this competition his floor event form sharply rose with a Victory over Richie Burnett in a Players Championship Final in Germany earning him his first ever PDC tournament victory and \u00a36,000. This was followed soon later with a Semi-final and final appearance in a weekend in Barnsley further pushing him up the order of merit. Due to his 3rd-place finish at the previous World Championship Webster qualified for the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts. Despite losing 5\u20132 to Wayne Jones in his first game a 5\u20133 win over Mark Hylton left him with a chance to qualify however even though he beat Gary Anderson 5\u20133 it was not enough as he missed multiple doubles to win the match with the required scoreline of 5\u20131 to qualify. Webster was the Welsh captain for the inaugural 2010 PDC World Cup of Darts in which Barrie Bates was his partner. After beating New Zealand in their first game 6\u20134 Webster and Bates became the surprise package of the tournament topping their group in the next stage which included wins over the Scottish pairing of Gary Anderson and Robert Thornton and the Spanish team of Carlos Rodriguez and Antonio Alcinas who had knocked out the England team consisting of world number one and two Phil Taylor and James Wade. This meant that they played the Australian team of Simon Whitlock and Paul Nicholson in the Semi-finals. A 6\u20135 win for Webster over Nicholson in the opening match proved crucial as it kept them in the match after the other 3 matches were won by Australia taking the match the doubles match. They won this 6\u20134 which meant that the match would go to a sudden death leg to decide who went to the final. Despite Australia winning the throw for the bull and opening with a 180 from Whitlock consecutive 140's from Wales got them back in the match. Bates then held his nerve to take out a 116 to take them to the final which also went to the doubles match after Webster defeated Co Stomp\u00e9 and Raymond van Barneveld back to back with a 100+ average in each match. However they lost the doubles 8\u20135 to finish runners up in the tournament."

In the quarter-final he knocked out 15-time and defending world champion Phil Taylor by 5 sets to 2 to reach his second successive World Championship semi-final. He lost 6\u20134 to Adrian Lewis in the semi-finals, continuing the trend of players beating Taylor but going on to lose their next match when the event is televised. This earned him \u00a350,000 and Moved him into the top 16 of the PDC rankings for the first time at number 13. Webster played in the 2011 Premier League. His early form was strong, pushing Taylor hard with a 170 out-shot and avenging his loss to Adrian Lewis with an average of 110.19 \u2013 the second highest ever achieved in the Premier league (behind Taylor). However, he then had a great loss in form, receiving 8\u20131 defeats at the hands of James Wade and Phil Taylor among other heavy losses, leaving him bottom of the table with two wins and a draw from his fourteen matches. At the 2011 UK Open, Webster reached the semi-finals and led James Wade 9\u20137 in their best-of-19 match, but lost 10\u20139 despite throwing for the match on two occasions. Webster reached his second quarter-final at the Grand Slam of Darts, once again beating John Part en route to a defeat by Lewis. Webster finally reached his first PDC major final at the 2011 Players Championship Finals, beating number one seed Justin Pipe after seeing six match darts missed against him, followed by wins over Dave Chisnall and Wes Newton, before being defeated by Kevin Painter."

However, he was tied on points and leg difference with Newton so a nine-dart shootout was required.

        "content": "Vladimir Sergeyevich Shilykovsky () (3 April 1933 \u2013 7 April 1987) was a Soviet/Russian speed skater. Shilykovsky competed internationally from 1956 to 1960, and took part in two Winter Olympics, both times in the 10,000\u00a0m. His best season was 1958, when he won the overall silver medal in both the European Championships at Eskilstuna and in the World Championships at Helsinki, on both occasions trailing just behind Oleg Goncharenko. It is widely acknowledged that Shilykovsky had to skate the final 10,000\u00a0m distance in much less favourable conditions than Goncharenko, and Shilykovsky was seen as the \"moral world champion\" by the spectators and commentators. At the start of the Olympic 1960 season, the world record on the 10,000\u00a0m was still the legendary 16:32.6 set in 1952 by Hjalmar Andersen (although Nikolay Shtelbaums had skated 16:31.4 in Chelyabinsk on 4 February 1959, a result not ratified by the International Skating Union (ISU)). On 31 January 1960 at Medeo, both Shtelbaums (16:18.9) and Shilykovsky (16:13.1) skated below Andersen's record time, at the traditional \"Prize of the Soviet Ministry of the Kazakh Republic\" competition; but again these world record times were not officially ratified by the ISU. At the 1960 Winter Olympics four weeks later, first Kjell B\u00e4ckman (16:14.2) and then Knut Johannesen (15:46.6) lowered the official world record, while Shilykovsky only managed a 20th place, skating in unfavourable conditions. Shilykovsky's personal bests were 42.8 (500\u00a0m), 2:15.1 (1,500\u00a0m), 8:06.7 (5,000\u00a0m), in addition to the 16:13.1 (10,000\u00a0m). Shilykovsky grew up in Vladimir but moved to Moskva for education and for sports. He became Moskva champion in 1955 and finished his master of sports degree the same year. He skated for Shakhter and later on for Spartak. He held a degree in technical sciences (\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a) from 1969, and published scholarly articles in his field. Shilykovsky was a highly unusual athlete by being able to compete at world top level in spite of a severe handicap; he lost his right arm when he was six months old as the result of an illness. This did not stop him taking part in all normal activities. In addition to his speed skating achievements, he was an accomplished swimmer and cyclist."

During his tenure, Archer was responsible for all Tasmanian government buildings including those for penal and military purposes. His major architectural works include Parliament House, Hobart, the Treasury and the Audit Department buildings in Hobart, the Ordnance Stores in Salamanca Place, several buildings at Anglesea Barracks; St John's Church, New Town; the nave of St. George's Church at Battery Point; Old Trinity (the Penitentiary Chapel) in Hobart; St Luke's Presbyterian Church at Bothwell, St Luke's Church of England at Richmond; and parts of the Campbell Street Gaol, Hobart.

        "content": "John Lee Archer, born 26 April 1791, was a notable architect whose work helped shape the development of the townships of Tasmania during early settlement. He was the only son of John Archer, an Irish engineer from County Tipperary, and his wife Charlotte Lee, formerly of Kent, England. The first records show that Archer, at the age of 18, was taught under the guidance of Charles Beazley, an architect based in London. Commencing in April 1809, Archer remained under Beazley's instruction for the duration of his three-year term of articles before moving on to the office of John Rennie the Elder in April 1813 in the position of drawing clerk. Archer's employment with Rennie was terminated in 1818, he returned to Ireland and worked as an engineer for over 8 years, building his reputation. Following his father's death in 1822 and the ongoing strain of the economic depression of the time, Archer sought to find employment elsewhere. His opportunity came in December 1826 when John Rennie's son recommended Archer for the position of Colonial Architect in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) as the need arose for the development of public buildings and offices to accommodate the growing convict and free-settler population of Van Diemen's Land. Upon arrival in Hobart Town on 2 August 1827, Archer immediately commenced work in the role of Civil Engineer and Architect for the colony. Alongside the high demand for prisons and other buildings of a convict nature, the rise in free settlers due to the ongoing depression called for the development of other public works to accommodate the needs of colonial life, such as police offices, public offices, military barracks and churches. For the majority of the 11 years that John Lee Archer served as Civil Engineer and Colonial Architect, he was responsible for all government commissioned buildings, many still notable today. Archer married Sophia Mattinson of Hobart on 3 September 1833 and the pair established a home in New Town with their many children. Due to a temporary decline in colonial revenue Archer was retrenched in 1838 and was never reinstated in his role. As others moved in to take over his responsibilities in his absence, Archer became isolated from his profession at the age of 47 with little hope of local employment opportunities. In October of the same year Archer moved to north-west Tasmania and took the position of police magistrate for the district of Horton.  He stayed with this role for the remainder of his life. In 1843 he produced a map of Stanley, reproduced by Betty Jones in Along the terrace: the owners and occupiers of Stanley 1843 -1922. John Lee Archer died at the age of 61 on 4 December 1852, and is buried at Circular Head."

        "content": "Tasmanian Parliament House is one of John Lee Archer's most notable projects. Its location on the waterfront of Sullivans Cove was seen as ideal for Hobart's new Customs House (which is what it was known as up until 1904).  Designed in 1835, construction was completed in 1838 with the majority of labor being carried out by convicts. The Customs Department opened in September 1840 while the first session of Parliament occurred on 19 June 1841. Honey colored sandstone quarried from Salamanca place was used to construct the distinctly 'Colonial Georgian' style building. Parliament House is one of the clearest examples of how Archer designed his work to have a sense of strength and permanence. The entrance hall is fitted with large Doric columns aimed at creating a significant threshold whilst the rusticated masonry and deeply shadowed arches accentuate the boldness of the building and its clean, clear lines. The Old Market Building once screened off the fa\u00e7ade, but over its 120 years of existence and further land reclamation, flanking trees, flowerbeds and sweeping lawns, now surround it. Whilst significant renovations to the interior have taken place, and the slate roof was removed and replaced with tiles, the fa\u00e7ade still remains today almost exactly how it was first constructed. Unlike a lot of Archer's penal projects, which have since been demolished, Parliament House is still occupied today by the Parliament of Tasmania. For this reason alone it is one of, if not the most significant project of Archer's entire career."

        "content": "In the 1830s, Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) experienced an influx of close to 2000 new convicts, making the total over 10,000. Hobart Town, originally established as a gaol town, was most affected by this population growth.  To cope with the increase, penitentiaries were constructed all over the state.  In 1829 John Lee Archer was commissioned to design a chapel for the existing Prisoner's Barracks Penitentiary. The chapel was designed to also act as an extension to the already overflowing Barracks. Cruciform in shape, the chapel arms enclosed exercise yards that could hold 500 prisoners on bench seats. Archer was also instructed to construct a cell block beneath the chapel floor to house prisoners in solitary confinement. To support the inclined floors of the chapel above, the cells have varying ceiling heights. Other features of the cells include no ventilation and no sunlight. Part of the design for the chapel layout included opening up the northern wing to cope with the overflow of people from the nearby St. David's Church. As a result of this Archer was free to design the tower for the Brisbane Street entrance to the chapel. The tower has trappings of Renaissance Greek Temples and derived inspiration from the English architect Christopher Wren. The tower of the chapel has a floor level that is 5 meters above street level to make room for the solitary confinement cells. This allowed an inclusion of a spiralling staircase that ran within the tower. The chapel suffered from time and budget delays and was not in full use until 1833. It was used by the public until 1845 when it was decommissioned and used by police offices, convicts, and their families."

He then illegally crossed the border to Norway in a boat and met with Norwegian reporters. While wearing Nazi symbols, he told the reporters that he was \"not a nationalist, but a racist\". Joined by two neo-Nazis from \"an ex-Soviet Baltic state\" living in Norway, he appeared at the International Police Immigration Service in Oslo on September 21, 2010, where he handed in a loaded weapon, declared himself a \"white warrior\" and requested political asylum. As a result, the police searched their tattoo shop where they found five illegal handguns and an entrance card stolen from the Norwegian Armed Forces. Nazi paraphernalia including a large doll dressed up as a Nazi was found near the front entrance of the shop. The newspaper interviewed residents near the tattoo shop who claimed they 'often heard loud noise, screaming and banging'. The neighbors also stated they would occasionally see the occupants of the tattoo shop 'practicing fighting and boxing while completely naked'. All three were then jailed, while the case is being investigated. On October 18 Russian authorities sent an extradition request to Norwegian authorities. In the week of October 29, a Norwegian police physician submitted a report based on conversations with Datsik and review of available documents which concluded that he did not have a serious mental disease. Datsik's lawyers are of the opinion that Russian authorities made up the psychiatric diagnosis and that Norwegian authorities on that ground must allow Datsik to remain in Norway. Datsik also claims that he was tortured by Russian authorities. The torture included the application of electrodes to his genitals and placing him in an iron cage for eight months, naked and handcuffed. He has twice attempted suicide in Norwegian detainment due to being isolated from the other prisoners, but he was again isolated after shouting racist remarks from his cell window. Datsik had been placed in solitary confinement for four weeks despite the court's order being limited to one week. Norwegian police blamed capacity issues for this. The Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet writes that Datsik has allegedly told the police that he wants his girlfriend to come to Norway for family reunification. He has since asked the court to give him the maximum sentence, as he has said that it would help him live a healthier life, while announcing that he is \"too raw for humanity\". He has told the Norwegian media that he wants to compete in mixed martial arts under the flag of Norway. Russia has sought the extradition of Datsik. On December 22, 2010, a demonstration was held by his followers in Oslo. Viacheslav Datsik was deported from Norway on March 18, 2011. In December 2011, rumours surfaced from Russia, that Datsik had been killed in a prison fight. However Alexander Zubov, Head of Press Service of the Federal Penitentiary Service management for the St. Petersburg and Leningrad region, dismissed the reports, claiming that Datsik is well and healthy."

It was through this unlikely career path that Khoury became interested in writing, as Khoury was introduced to a Wall Street investment banker who developed screenplays in his spare time. Taking an idea of his that the two jointly developed, Khoury wrote a screenplay which was a finalist for a Fulbright Fellowship in Screenwriting. His second writing attempt, a semi-autobiographical account of his college years in war-torn Lebanon was also shortlisted for the same award. In 1996, Khoury optioned the rights to the Melvyn Bragg novel The Maid of Buttermere and wrote the screenplay adaptation of it.

        "content": "During the early days of his screenwriting career, before he was even able to attract an agent, Khoury completed a screenplay that he called The Last Templar, an \"epic\" thriller about a search for the lost treasure of the Knights Templar.  After 18 months of research and writing, Khoury lent the script to a friend, who immediately suggested that Khoury turn it into a novel.  With Khoury's permission, the friend submitted the screenplay to a book agent.  Within a few months (in 1996), Khoury was offered a six-figure advance by a major publisher to create a book based on the screenplay, with the stipulation that the book exclude all references to religion.  Although at that time Khoury had not sold any of his other writing work, he declined the money and the book deal. His pet screenplay set aside, Khoury worked on his screenplays for several years, building a successful career for himself in London and in Hollywood, before a new agent at the William Morris Agency, who he had joined at that point, read his screenplay of The Last Templar and encouraged him to adapt it into a novel.  Finally, in September 2002, Khoury began researching and writing the novelized version of his screenplay, which took three years to write.  The novel sold quickly, and was first released in the U.K. in 2005. It soon became a New York Times bestseller, spending 11 weeks on the hardcover fiction list, and a Number 1 bestseller overseas.  It has been translated into 38 languages and published in over 40 countries.  Although the book shares some general thematic concepts with those of Da Vinci Code author Dan Brown, Khoury devised his plot before Brown's novels were released. Following the release of The Sanctuary in August 2007, Khoury wrote his third novel titled The Sign. This was published in the U.S. on May 19, 2009 as both a traditional hardcover book and as an electronic book. The Templar Salvation, a sequel to The Last Templar, was published in 2010."

At that time, wallpaper was becoming popular among the bourgeoisie as a creative and economical way to decorate interior spaces. During the Seven Years' War Reveillon started to produce wallpaper himself, marrying well and using his wife's dowry to produce velvet paper, pasted up into rolls and using vibrant colours, developed by Jean-Baptiste Pillement. In 1759 he moved to the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, then a neighbourhood dominated by the various crafts associated with furnishing. R\u00e9veillon launched production of a full range of wallpapers. The nobility began to patronize his business and in 1765\u2014--already extremely wealthy--\u2014he bought a mansion, with a parc and a theatre inside La Folie Titon, formerly owned by \u00c9vrard Titon du Tillet. Reveillon installed his wallpaper factory on the ground floor, retaining the upper floors for his private residence. In 1775 R\u00e9veillon opened a paper mill to improve both the quantity and quality of his paper supply. In 1776 he opened a shop near the Tuileries. The papier bleu d'Angleterre became very popular when Queen Marie Antoinette decorated her apartments with them. R\u00e9veillon himself dabbled in chemistry enough to discover a new process for making vellum paper in 1782. The following year he was granted permission to use the title of Manufacture Royale. His purchase of the paper mill and expertise in paper production brought him into contact with Etienne de Montgolfier, and it was from R\u00e9veillon's garden at Folie Titon that the first hot-air balloon was launched on 12 September 1783. R\u00e9veillon delivered a special and colourful wallpaper, used as a cover for the balloon. A second balloon, called Le R\u00e9veillon, with a rooster, a duck and a sheep was launched a week later at Versailles. On 19 October his employee Andr\u00e9 Giroud de Villette and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier went into the sky, as pioneers of flight."

That in turn would allow lower wage costs, lower manufacturing prices and brisk consumption.\" This musing was misinterpreted by an already angry Parisian populace, who believed that Monseigneur Reveillon was advocating a lowering in wages. On 28 April 1789 his mansion was attacked and looted by an angry mob, all the wallpaper, glue, furniture and paintings were burned. His wine cellar, containing 2,000 bottles of wine, was pillaged and quickly consumed by the riotous mob. R\u00e9veillon and his family escaped by climbing a wall and fleeing to the nearby Bastille. It was a bloody day, some say 25 people dying in the ensuing melee. The rioters were eventually dispersed in an opening episode of the French Revolution. Today plaques mark the site of the Reveillon riot. R\u00e9veillon emigrated to England with his fortune intact, and after the French Revolution, leased his manufacture to Jacquemart & B\u00e9rnard, who continued to produce wallpaper till 1840."

In 1986 he founded 2 bands: Bik Bent Braam (with Angelo Verploegen, Eric Boeren, Wolter Wierbos, Peter Haex, Carl Ludwig H\u00fcbsch, Peter van Bergen, Jan Willem van der Ham, Bart van der Putten, Frans Vermeerssen, Frank Gratkowski, J\u00f6rg Brinkmann, Michael Vatcher) and Bentje Braam. In 1987 Michiel Braam was commissioned by the NOS. He composed a work for 4 clarinets and piano entitled Cows and Beasts. It was performed by Braam on piano, and the clarinet players Ab Baars, Theo J\u00f6rgensmann, Michael Moore and Louis Sclavis. In 1989 he founded Trio BraamDeJoodeVatcher (with Wilbert de Joode and Michael Vatcher), in 2005 eBraam (fka Wurli Trio, with Pieter Douma and Dirk-Peter K\u00f6lsch), and in 2011 Michiel Braam's Hybrid 10tet (with eBraam, the classical Matangi String Quartet, Taylor Ho Bynum, Carl Ludwig H\u00fcbsch and Nils Wogram). In 2015 the trio \"Nos Otrobanda\" was formed with Aty de Windt on bass and Andr\u00e9 Groen on g\u00fcira. That band specialises in Antillean Walttzes. Together with Frans Vermeerssen he co-leads the sextet All Ears (with Herb Robertson, Frank Gratkowski, Wilbert de Joode and Michael Vatcher). He worked also with musicians like George Lewis, Benjamin Herman, Han Bennink, Conny and Hannes Bauer and Steve Arg\u00fcelles. The orchestra Bik Bent Braam was considered to be one of the main bigger orchestras in the field of improvisation-music and performed worldwide, as the trio BraamDeJoodeVatcher still does. In 2007 Braam composed Nopera, a sort of music theater piece in which the written parts could be performed at random and contained much room for improvisation, and the libretto was written in the Nothingyettish language. In 2012 Bik Bent Braam stopped and a septet named Flex Bent Braam took its place. In 2013 the first program \"Lucebert\" of that band was presented on stage and with an album. In 2015 eBraam recorded \"The Extraordinary Love Story of Aye Aye and Fedor\", with singer Dean Bowman as narrator, after Ana Isabel Ordonez's children's book, in a bigger project that involves also dance and fine art. 2016 Reeds & Deeds started, with Frans Vermeerssen, Alex Coke, Bo van de Graaf, Arjen Gorter and Makki van Engelen. This sextet plays the music of Roland Kirk and issued an album in 2019, \"Live at JazzCase\". In 2020 it will be 25 years ago Bik Bent Braam performed the program \"The XIJZ of Bik Bent Braam\". A special Latin version of this program will be touring during the anniversary year 2020 by the new 13-piece ensemble Son Bent Braam (including Angelo Verploegen, Jo\u00ebl Botma, Ilja Reijngoud, Efe Erdem, Efra\u00efm Trujillo, Bart van der Putten, Frans Vermeerssen, Jesse Schilderink, Aty de Windt, Andr\u00e9 Groen, Danny Rombout and Martin Gort entitled \"El XYZ de Son Bent Braam\". In 1988, Braam was honoured with the Podium prize and in 1997 he got Dutch most important jazz prize, the VPRO/Boy Edgar Award."

        "content": "Matthew Richter (born 1968 in New York City) is an American author, producer, performer, and arts entrepreneur living in Seattle, Washington. He is the Interim Executive Director of the Cultural Space Agency, having most recently served for 9 years as the Cultural Space Liaison for the City of Seattle. He is also well known as the founder of Consolidated Works, a contemporary arts center in Seattle. Richter has been producing alternative contemporary art, performance, film and music since his graduation from Northwestern University in 1990. In 1992, he formed the seminal Rm 608, a gallery for visual and performing arts, in an abandoned storefront on Seattle's Capitol Hill. The \"small but influential\" (The Stranger) organization served as the launching point for local talents such as David Schmader, the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players, Kia Sian, and Kristen Kosmas, and over the course of its two-year lifespan presented over 200 world-premiere works of theater and performance art, several of which received continued runs off-Broadway in New York City. On its closing in 1994 (the organization's lifespan was built into its structure, and the closing was anticipated) Richter was quoted in The Seattle Weekly as saying, \"Organizations should end, in the same way that performances end, so that the audience can clap, go home, and think about what it meant.\" In 1994, he was hired as the Theater Editor of The Stranger, the alternative newsweekly in Seattle. While there, he expanded his interest in writing and published investigative journalism (according to the paper's website, one undercover report earned him personal bodyguard protection following death threats made by the group investigated) and feature-length articles that were reprinted in alternative newsweeklies around the country. He was also published in an American Heritage college geography textbook.  He left the newspaper in 1997 but continues to publish sporadically, most recently writing on the issue of nonprofit reform in America. In 1998, he formed Consolidated Works, a contemporary arts center in Seattle, housed in a renovated  warehouse in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood. Art in America called ConWorks (as it was known for short) \"the most dazzling\" alternative arts space in the Northwest. Over the course of seven years as its executive director, he grew the organization into one of the region's most prestigious arts presenters, working with teams of curators and producers to fill the facility's theater, cinema, visual art gallery, music hall, lecture stage, and bar. The center flourished, reportedly thanks to Richter's \"legendary fundraising skills\" and \"internationally renowned programming\" (Seattle Post-Intelligencer). In 2002 he was one of twelve individuals invited under the auspices of the Rockefeller Foundation to contribute as founding members of the National Arts and Technology Network. In 2003 he received the Seattle Mayor's Arts Award on behalf of ConWorks, and also in 2003 was one of 12 recipients nationally of the Safeco Insurance Rudy Award for leadership in the nonprofit sector. A profile of the Seattle arts scene in Art in America referred to Richter as \"an arts visionary.\" A profile in The Stranger referred to him as \"freakishly ambitious.\""

He had his feature film debut in the 1985 film Compromising Positions, starring Susan Sarandon, and in 1986 had his first recurring role on television on the HBO situation comedy series 1st & Ten. He starred alongside O. J. Simpson and Sam J. Jones in HBO's sequel to 1st & Ten titled Training Camp: The Bulls Are Back, and John Voorhees of The Seattle Times wrote: \"The cast, which includes O.J. Simpson, Sam Jones and newcomer Jason Beghe, is first-rate.\" In 1988, he starred in the film Monkey Shines: An Experiment In Fear, directed by George A. Romero. He portrayed Allan Mann, a law student made quadriplegic when hit by a truck in the opening credits of the film. The Philadelphia Inquirer gave a positive review of Beghe's performance in Monkey Shines: \"Acting only with his face and voice, Jason Beghe is terrific at conveying the mounting anger and rage of an active man made passive\". David Foil of The Advocate described Beghe's performance as \"remarkable simply for meeting the demands of the character\". Beghe played an ice hockey star in the Perry Mason TV film The Case of the All-Star Assassin, an NBC-TV telefeature broadcast November 19, 1989. In 1991 he played a State Trooper in the film Thelma & Louise (reuniting him with Sarandon, with whom he'd appeared in Compromising Positions), and was Demi Moore's love interest in the 1997 film G.I. Jane. He had recurring roles on Picket Fences and Melrose Place, and became a cast member of Chicago Hope in 1997, portraying electrician Danny Blaines opposite romantic interest Dr. Austin played by Christine Lahti. In a 1997 interview in The Boston Herald, Beghe spoke about his respect for his fellow cast members in Chicago Hope: \"I think it's the best cast assembled that I've ever seen. One for one, they're incredible. And to work with Christine Lahti? I'd drop a lot of things for that. She's so good and smart and dedicated. I've become a better actor just for working with her.\" He commented on his character on Melrose Place, a closeted military officer who had feelings for Matt, played by Doug Savant: \"I thought we should kiss, but it was too much. TV is a very specific medium, and you're naive if you think that everything is just based on artistic decisions. If it prevents them from selling some products, that's a major consideration. But I'm an actor. I'll do whatever it takes.\" In 1993, Beghe played Lt. Pat Rudledge in the television drama series Matlock. Beghe co-starred with Moira Kelly in the 1998 CBS television drama series To Have & to Hold, where he played police officer Sean McGrail. Mike Duffy of The Detroit Free Press wrote: \"There is an affectionate romantic sizzle between the ruggedly handsome Beghe (\"G.I. Jane\") and the dark-haired, unconventionally attractive Kelly (\"Little Odessa\").\" Kinney Littlefield of The Orange County Register said that \"Beghe and Kelly have charm.\" Beghe appeared in acting roles on Numb3rs, CSI: NY, Everwood, Criminal Minds, Veronica Mars, \"Jag\" and Cane. Beghe portrayed exorcist Ray Purvis in the 2008 horror film One Missed Call. In 2009, Beghe had a guest-starring role on the television show Californication. He played the character novelist Richard Bates, a friend of character Hank Moody (played by David Duchovny). \"Bates, played by Jason Beghe, made for an interesting character and the fact that he didn't get as much screen time as some of the other characters is a shame,\" wrote Danny Gallagher of TV Squad. In October 2009, Beghe was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for the filming of the movie The Next Three Days, directed by Paul Haggis. The film was released in 2010 and starred Elizabeth Banks, Russell Crowe, Brian Dennehy, and Olivia Wilde. Since 2014, Beghe has starred on Chicago P.D.; the show is a spin-off of Chicago Fire, on which Beghe played a recurring role. Chicago P.D. follows the detectives of the Chicago Police Department's Intelligence Unit that combats the city's major offenses, including organized crime, drug trafficking, and high-profile murders. Beghe plays the role of Sgt. Hank Voight, a \"tough cop\" who heads the Intelligence Unit. On November 21, 2017, Deadline Hollywood reported that Beghe was investigated for behavior that was considered overly aggressive and possibly sexual harassment while filming Chicago P.D. in 2016. Claims of inappropriate behavior were reportedly made by his former co-star, Sophia Bush. Beghe released a statement in which he acknowledged having anger problems, stated that he was working on them, admitted to engaging in aggressive behavior on set, and apologized."

He participated in an interview about his experiences as a Scientologist; a clip of that interview was published online by Scientology critic Mark Bunker in mid-April 2008. In the video, Beghe asserted that Scientology was \"very dangerous for your spiritual, psychological, mental, emotional health and evolution\". The clip ended with Beghe stating, \"I don't have an agenda. I'm just trying to help. [...] I have the luxury of having gotten into Scientology and after having been in it, been out. And that's a perspective that people who are still in and not out do not have.\" Marina Hyde of The Guardian has called Beghe a Scientology celebrity whistleblower. On April 28, 2008, Beghe posted online a letter to Church leader David Miscavige. In the letter, he requested the confidential confessional files that Scientology compiles during Auditing sessions. Beghe told The Village Voice that these confidential files are kept on actor Tom Cruise and other celebrity Scientologists. Beghe has asserted that Scientology's practice of disconnection was still in place as of 2008. In an interview with Tony Ortega of The Village Voice, Beghe stated that the expulsion of his four-year-old son from a Scientology school was an example of disconnection. Beghe has turned down opportunities to speak about his experiences with Scientology on television; he says, \"I just wanted to make sure that the story isn't about me. It's not about me. It's about helping others who are still lost in the cult, or toying with the idea of getting involved.\" On May 29, 2008, Beghe attended a protest against the Church of Scientology held outside the Scientology building on East 46th Street in New York City. In September 2008, Beghe traveled to Europe where he spoke with government officials in Hamburg, Germany, about his experiences as a Scientologist. Beghe suggested that governments put up warning signs about Scientology that are similar to warnings placed on packs of cigarettes; the next day, a member of Germany's Interior Department told him such a sign was placed outside a Church of Scientology building in Berlin. Beghe was a guest in May 2009 on the BBC World Service radio program World: Have Your Say, where he discussed his views on what he thought of Scientology when he first joined: \"I thought that it was something that was going to deliver miracles, and that it was the most selfless group of people that were totally dedicated to helping mankind, and I wanted to be part of it.\" He was also critical of Scientology leadership: \"I think that there are probably things of Scientology that are valuable and that can help people \u2013 my main issue is not with Scientology per se, it is with Scientology the organization \u2013 it is a corrupt I believe and probably a criminal endeavor, and that has to do with people who are in charge of Scientology mainly David Miscavige...\" In September 2010, Beghe took part in a BBC News Panorama documentary, The Secrets of Scientology, in which he spoke about his decision to leave the organization. Beghe also appeared in the 2015 HBO documentary Going Clear, based upon the book of the same name by Lawrence Wright."

In fact, he played in the West Regional Final in March of 1967, where Pacific fell to eventual National champion UCLA, led by sophomore Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Ferguson reached the majors in 1970 with the Los Angeles Dodgers, becoming their everyday catcher in 1973. He set a major league record for catchers by committing only three errors, leading the National League catchers in fielding percentage (.996) and double plays (17), while hitting .263 with a .369 on-base percentage. He also reached career-highs in games played (136), home runs (25), RBI (88), runs (84), doubles (26) and walks (87). When Steve Yeager became a regular in the 1973 midseason, Ferguson shared catching duties and played right field against left-handed pitchers.  He soon became known for having one of the strongest throwing arms of any outfielder in the major leagues.  This came into play during Game One of the 1974 World Series against the Oakland Athletics, when Ferguson made a memorable play in right field in the top of the eighth inning, running in front of teammate Jimmy Wynn to catch a fly ball off the bat of Reggie Jackson, and then firing a 300-foot strike to Yeager to gun down Sal Bando, who was trying to score from third base.  In Game Two, Ferguson hit a two-run homer off Vida Blue to provide the only Dodgers' victory in the Series. He enjoyed another fine season in 1977 with Houston, catching 122 games and hitting 16 home runs with 61 RBI and a .379 OBP. Reacquired by the Dodgers in the 1978 midseason, he helped his team reach the 1978 World Series. After retiring, he coached at the major league level with the Texas Rangers (1986\u201387), working under former Dodger teammate Bobby Valentine, and the Dodgers (1988\u201394). He also managed in the Dodgers, Baltimore Orioles and San Diego Padres minor league systems. He managed the Camden Riversharks Atlantic League baseball team in New Jersey for 3 seasons from 2007 - 2009. In a 14-season career, Ferguson was a .240 hitter with 122 home runs and 445 RBI in 1013 games. In 13 postseason games, he hit .200 (7-for-35) with one home run and four RBI."

Together during the early 17th century, they began to collaborate in quadratura, with Curti painting the structures, while Spada painted the figures. They soon parted, with Spada becoming a canvas painter, and Curti was to travel to paint in Modena, Parma (1618 and 1630), Rome (1623) and Genoa. He returned from Rome to Bologna, and there was assisted by Michelangelo Colonna, Agostino Mitelli, and Andrea Seghizzi, and painted architectural backgrounds for Guercino frescoes.

When Benson left California, he started the 2006\u20132007 NBDL year with the Austin Toros. He had a game high of eight points on November 25, but averaged 2.4 points per game and was released by the team on January 3, 2007. He was subsequently signed by the Dakota Wizards on January 9, 2007. In one of his first contests with the Wizards, he scored 17 points in 17 minutes. He ended the year with an average of 10.8 PPG. On March 17, 2007, he scored a personal high 27 points in a 126\u2013100 win over the Arkansas Rimrockers. After training with the NBA's New Jersey Nets during the summer of 2007, Benson was re-signed by the Wizards for the 2007\u20132008 season and recorded averages of 13.6 points and a league best 12.1 rebounds per game. On August 25, 2008, he was signed by defending French Pro-A league champion SLUC Nancy.  He requested and was granted a release on December 12, 2008. Soon after, he signed a deal with the NBDL's Dakota Wizards, his former D-League team. On March 4, 2009, he was traded to the Reno Bighorns for Jesse Smith. Benson has played for the Utah Jazz in the Orlando Pro Summer League, and later for the Los Angeles Clippers in the NBA Summer League in 2010. From 2010 to 2014 he played for three different teams in the Korean Basketball League, winning back-to-back championships in 2013 and 2014 with the Ulsan Mobis Phoebus. Towards the end of the 2013\u20132014 season the relationship with the team turned sour and he was cut shortly before the start of the new season under allegations of demanding more money, which Benson himself denied. After three months of preparation in his home state of California, Benson was picked up by the team of Bank of Taiwan of the Taiwanese Super Basketball League in December 2014. After having played just five games in the SBL, averaging 18 points and 11 rebounds, Benson signed a deal with GlobalPort Batang Pier of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) in early January 2015. The team chose him out of a group of four prospects as their import player in hopes of winning the PBA Commissioner's Cup, but Benson exceeded the team's 6'9\" height limit and was replaced shortly after. In early June 2015 Benson was signed by the Dominican National League's Indios de San Francisco de Macor\u00eds. In his first game after the short hiatus he scored 8 points, 9 rebounds and 2 assists in 25 minutes."

        "content": "Benson writes a personal blog titled Too Much Rod Benson, as well as contributing to the Ball Don't Lie blog on Yahoo! Sports. He wrote an autobiographical feature article that was published in SLAM Magazine in April 2008. He has also been featured in ESPN The Magazine,  and was profiled on the ESPN television series E:60 by Bill Simmons in April 2008. Benson's blogging has actually been viewed in a negative light by some NBA executives, however, who actually call it a \"red flag\"\u2014not only because they see him spending time writing and filming instead of working on his game (a notion Benson disputes, citing his 2007\u201308 NBDL All-Star status), but also because they fear the free-spirited Benson will break the \"locker room code\" and write candidly about coaches, teammates, & the front office. But Benson maintains that he still has to \"keep it real\": \"What you get is a blog that chronicles the ridiculousness that I call my life, complete with photos, videos, and whatever else may be necessary for you to get the point.\" BOOMTHO! BOOMTHO! is the California-based lifestyle brand founded by Benson in 2006. It's devoted to the philosophy of \"having fun, being ridiculous, and being yourself\"  with bright, fun styles that epitomize West Coast culture. The phrase \"Boom Tho\" was started by Benson (founder & CEO) while attending UC Berkeley. In addition to being a catchphrase, BOOMTHO! grew from a blog and T-shirt line to a full men and women's clothing line featuring T-shirts, tank tops, hats, swim gear, and sweatshirts. Currently, BOOMTHO! is a lifestyle brand covering clothing and accessories,  music, videos, and athletics. Benson also designs all BOOMTHO! merchandise. BOOMTHO! products are sold worldwide via BoomThoShop.com and have gained support by famous actors, athletes, and musicians. Some notable fans are Blake Griffin, Juelz Santana, Gordon Hayward, and The Rej3ctz, amongst many others."

        "content": "Born in Battle Creek, Michigan, Rush graduated from James Whitcomb Riley High School in South Bend, Indiana, and served in the United States Army during World War II. He was a combat veteran of the European theatre in Germany as a member of General George S. Patton's Third Army. His pro career began in the Cub farm system in 1947. After only one year of minor-league seasoning, he joined the Cubs' MLB pitching staff. Pitching for a succession of poor teams, he lost 140 of the 250 decisions he earned as a Cub. Rush tied for the National League lead in games lost with 20 in 1950, his first All-Star season. Two years later, he had the best year of his career, winning 17 games (third most in the league) with a stellar 2.70 earned run average, fifth-best in the Senior Circuit. Selected to his second All-Star team that year, he appeared in the 1952 midsummer classic, played July 8 at Shibe Park. Rush worked two innings, entering the game in the fourth with the NL ahead, 1\u20130. He allowed the rival American League to forge ahead with two runs and three hits. But in the very next half-inning, his National League teammates, led by fellow Cub Hank Sauer, who homered, got those runs back to regain the lead, 3\u20132. Rush then held the Junior Circuit off the scoreboard in the fifth inning. With the game having gone the required 4 innings, the National League\u2014and Rush\u2014were awarded a victory when the contest was ended by rain. In addition to his 17\u201313 record in 1952, Rush also posted back-to-back over-.500 seasons in  (13\u201311) and  (13\u201310); his earned run averages of 3.50 and 3.19 during those seasons were ninth and seventh, respectively, in the National League."

        "content": "Rush was traded to the defending world champion Braves in a five-player deal in December 1957. He then worked in 28 games, starting 20, and posted five complete games and two shutouts during the  Braves' successful defense of their league pennant. He was Milwaukee's starting pitcher for Game 3 of the 1958 World Series at Yankee Stadium, with the Braves ahead in the Series, two games to none. Rush gave the Braves six strong innings, allowing the New York Yankees only three hits. But control problems proved costly when Rush's three walks loaded the bases for Hank Bauer's two-run single. Those were all the runs Yankee starter Don Larsen needed in a 4\u20130 win. While the Braves captured Game 4 to build a three-games-to-one advantage, New York won Games 5\u20137 to take the world title away from Milwaukee. Rush was primarily a relief pitcher for the  Braves, making nine spot starts among his 30 appearances during the 154-game schedule and posting five victories and an effective 2.42 earned run average. The Braves found themselves embroiled in a three-way pennant fight with the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants that went down to the season's final weekend. When it ended, the Braves and Dodgers, both with 86\u201368 records, were deadlocked for the National League pennant, and a best-of-three tie-breaker series was necessary to determine a champion. The Dodgers won Game 1 at Milwaukee, putting the Braves' backs against the wall. In Game 2, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on September 29, the Braves squandered a 5\u20132 lead when the Dodgers rallied for three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning, tying the score and sending the contest into extra innings. In the 11th frame, Rush was called into the game with the Braves in dire straights: the Dodgers had the bases loaded, with two out. But he retired Charlie Neal on a ground ball to secure the third out and preserve the tie. In the 12th inning, Milwaukee did not score in its half and Rush returned to the mound. He retired the first two Los Angeles hitters, Wally Moon and Stan Williams, but then his fortunes changed. Gil Hodges walked and was singled to second base by Joe Pignatano. Veteran Carl Furillo then made an infield hit to shortstop, and when F\u00e9lix Mantilla threw wildly to first base, Hodges scored the pennant-deciding run on the error. Rush gave up no earned runs, but was charged with the loss."

        "content": "Rush split  between the Braves and the American League White Sox, getting into 19 total games as a relief pitcher. He earned his final two MLB victories and a save for Milwaukee before being sent to the White Sox on June 11. He was given his unconditional release in November, ending his pitching career. All told, Rush compiled a 127\u2013152 won\u2013lost record in MLB, with a 3.65 earned run average, 118 complete games and 16 shutouts. He earned eight saves coming out of the bullpen. In 2,410 innings pitched, he allowed 2,327 hits and 789 bases on balls. He struck out 1,244. On June 11, 1950, Rush and pitcher Warren Spahn of the Boston Braves each stole a base against each other; no opposing pitchers again stole a base in the same game until May 3, 2004, when Jason Marquis and Greg Maddux repeated the feat. Late in the 1957 season, while Rush was warming up in the Wrigley Field bullpen during a game, a wild pitch he threw went into the stands and injured a spectator, who sued him and the Cubs, one of the few times in Major League Baseball history when a player has been named as a defendant by a fan injured by an object that left the field. The court granted Rush summary judgement which was affirmed on appeal a decade later; however it held that the Baseball Rule, which generally immunizes teams against suits by fans injured by foul balls who sit in seats outside the backstop's protection, did not extend to an errantly thrown ball and that a jury could decide if the Cubs had adequately anticipated the risk of one leaving the field and striking a fan. Bob Rush died in Mesa, Arizona, the Cubs' longtime spring training home, at age 85."

The company folded in 1985 due to Vollbracht having accepted financial backing from Johnny Carson, which was withdrawn during Carson's bitter divorce from his third wife. Afterwards, Vollbracht published Nothing Sacred, a visual diary of his years in New York City and the many people he interacted with, and then moved to Florida to concentrate on his illustrations and art. In 1989, The New Yorker named him one of its top illustrators, and he would produce covers and other art for the next several years. In 1999, Vollbracht returned to the world of fashion after Bill Blass, a longtime friend and mentor, asked him to design a retrospective on Blass's work for Indiana University's art museum. The retrospective, curated by Kathleen Rowold, opened in 2002 after Blass's death. In 2003, Vollbracht returned to New York when he was invited to become head designer for Bill Blass Limited. He was the third designer to become head designer for the label. He resigned from the label a few years later in 2007."

The track aired was \"Human\", Hunt's biggest hit in the U.S.  His 1962 B-side, \"I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself\", written by Bacharach and David and produced by Leiber and Stoller, was the first recording of the song, which later became a major hit for Dusty Springfield, Dionne Warwick and others. Hunt became a regular performing at The Apollo in New York alongside such artists as Jackie Wilson, Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles, Diana Ross and The Supremes, The Shirelles, Dionne Warwick, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Sam and Dave. To the best of his knowledge, Hunt remains the only person to have his photograph framed twice in the Apollo foyer, both with the Flamingos and as a solo artist. Several years and a couple of minor hits later, Hunt sang for the U.S. Army in Germany. By 1969 he left his homeland, traveled back to Germany, through Belgium and across the English Channel to the United Kingdom."

A right-handed batsman, Hollick made his debut for Ireland against Sussex in August 1956, scoring one run before being bowled. His second and final match for Ireland was against Scotland in July 1957 scoring a duck in both innings, in what was his only first-class match. He later played one match for the USA national side, against Canada in Montreal in September 1967. He scored one run in the first innings and top-scored in the second with 22 as the USA lost the match by five wickets."

        "content": "Douglas Kiker (January 7, 1930 \u2013 August 14, 1991) was an American author and newspaper and television reporter whose career spanned three decades. Kiker was born in Griffin, Georgia. He first gained national attention for his book \"The Southerner,\" published in 1957 and followed by \"Strangers on the Shore\". Later, he became director of information for the Peace Corps, serving from 1961 until 1963.  He left the government and became a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune newspaper and in his first week on the job rode in the press bus in the motorcade of President John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. By 1966, NBC News had taken notice of his varied background and hired him as a correspondent.  He would remain with that network for the rest of his life. Kiker became distinguished for his numerous assignments over the years for NBC. Perhaps his best-known work was covering military conflicts in Southeast Asia (namely Vietnam) and the Mideast (particularly the Iranian Revolution); during much of that time, he served as NBC's Rome bureau chief, with a territory encompassing most of Europe and western Asia. He received the Peabody Award in 1970 for his coverage of the Black September in Jordan conflict. But Kiker also excelled at domestic stories, as well, including the civil rights movement and U.S. politics.  He reported from Walter Reed Army Medical Center on the 1969 death of President Dwight Eisenhower.  He was also the commentator on the August 9, 1974 live broadcast of President Richard Nixon's departure from office in disgrace from the Watergate scandal. Kiker filed reports for David Brinkley's documentaries and short-lived newsmagazines during the 1970s, in addition to his regular work on NBC Nightly News, where he occasionally anchored on the weekends.  Kiker worked as a floor reporter during NBC's coverage of the 1972 political conventions and was Washington editor for Today in the mid- to late 1970s. In the early 1980s, Kiker did a report critical of radio personality Howard Stern, just as Stern was leaving a Washington D.C. station to join WNBC-AM in New York.  The report likely foretold the problems Stern would later have at WNBC. Despite the success of his 1950s novels, Kiker did not return to book length fiction until later in his life, when he wrote three mystery novels, \"Murder on Clam Pond\" (published in 1986), \"Death at the Cut\" (1988), and \"Death Below Deck\" (1991). The mysteries were set on Cape Cod and featured reporter Mac McFarland. They received considerable critical acclaim. According to obituaries in The New York Times and other major newspapers, Douglas Kiker died in his sleep, apparently from a heart attack, while vacationing at his beloved Cape Cod summer home in Chatham, Massachusetts. He was 61. He was survived by his wife, one daughter, and four sons."

He was born in Culross, Scotland, the son of Alexander Bald (1753\u20131823), a colliery agent of Alloa. Robert Bald was one of the earliest and most eminent mining engineers and land surveyors in Scotland, and by the late nineteenth century he was referred to as \"the acknowledged father of mining engineering in Scotland\".

        "content": "Robert Bald apprenticed to his father Alexander, the superintendent and manager of the Mar collieries. The pair can be seen as forming 'something of a \"school\" of viewers', and a Scottish equivalent of the Buddle family of viewers of northern England. He combined two qualities vital for colliery direction: a deep practical knowledge with a respect for scientific enquiry (he contributed to the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal among other learned publications). Bald seems to have begun his consultative work around the turn of the century, by 1805 his advice was in great demand throughout Scottish coalfields, and he was called upon by both parties of dispute in court and by judges. In 1808 Bald travelled with Thomas Telford (1757\u20131834) to survey the G\u00f6ta Canal from Lake M\u00e4laren (Stockholm) to the lakes of V\u00e4nern and V\u00e4ttern in central Sweden. He returned to the country in 1826 when he was invited by the Swedish councillor of state, Baltzar von Platen, to survey the Skanian coal fields, which he did in the company of Sven Nilsson. Between 1808 and 1825, Bald published reports (NAS ref. CB27) on the mineral deposits, workings, buildings and drainage at collieries across Scotland. One of Bald's earliest publications was A General View of the Coal Trade in Scotland (1808), which is considered \"an excellent technical account of coal mining during the Industrial Revolution\", the book was reprinted in 1812 with the addition of \"An Inquiry into the Conditions of Women who carry Coals under Ground in Scotland, known by the name of Bearers\", in which he denounced this labour as a form of slavery. In 1812 David Brewster commissioned Bald to write the 'mine' entry for the 'Edinburg Encyclopaedia', a task that involved visiting the colliery at Killingworth where George Stephenson had introduced a steam-powered machine for raising coal from the pit face. In 1825 he and Stevenson drew up plans for the improvement of Alloa dock, which included the creation of a wet dock and swivel bridge. Apart from the construction of a stone pier, these plans were never executed. Alongside Stephenson, he was friends with the botanists Patrick Neill and George Walker-Arnott. Bald was elected a member of the Royal Society in 1817 and started working in general practise as a mining engineer in Edinburgh around 1820 with John Geddes. Bald and John Buddle share the credit for being the first to direct attention to the dangerous, highly flammable nature of coal dust. Bald pointed out the danger of the ignition of coal dust in a paper in Jameson's Journal, 1828. Bald was a cousin of William Bald (1789\u20131857) the civil engineer and cartographer, and acted as sponsor for William's membership of the Royal Society in 1829. Bald had enormously broad range of interests, visible in the large number of learned societies he was a member of and in the subjects on which he wrote. These range from articles and letters on mining engineering, palaeontology and archaeology, marine steam propulsion and metallurgy."

        "title": "Robert Bald_The reformer",
        "content": "For much of his life, Bald was employed by the Earls of Mar to manage collieries in Alloa, he used his position to try to improve the harsh working and living conditions of the miners and their families. First, working with John Francis Erskine, 23rd Earl of Mar, he condemned the practice of employing women and girls underground in the coal mines. 'In 1822 I tried to stop the employment of women and children as coal bearers, but the women had no other work so there was a great deal of hardship.' Together they started Friendly Societies to offer miners the opportunity to save money, they gave a small pension to retired miners, and set up a court system where miners could deal with their problems and settle differences between themselves. After the death of the colliery manager Alexander Bald, in 1823, the Earl handed over the running of collieries to trustees on the behalf of his family. This left Robert Bald and Robert Jameson, the estate factor, directing the pits by the time of the Earl's death in 1825. Bald's instincts to reform were allowed fuller rein once he gained control of the collieries. Bald's first efforts involved increasing housing accommodation, removing ash pits and sweeping of streets at the trustees expense. He then gave lectures on 'Order and Cleanliness', this was followed by a set of rules printed and circulated to miner's households including exhortations to wash their houses weekly, whitewash them yearly, keep streets clean and included proscriptions against keeping animals inside. A scheme to inspect miner's cottages was prevented by vocal outrage of miner's families. Bald's efforts reached a climax in the summer of 1832 during a cholera outbreak in Alloa, Collyland and New Sauchie. He issued a pamphlet ascribing the disease to God's wrathful judgement on the drunkenness of the miners, especially at the wakes (or dregies) taking place after the funerals for victims of the disease. Additionally, Bald supplied wine as an alternative to the whisky he thought was so damaging, had watchmen patrol the streets looking out for drunkenness, and introduced prayer meetings Alloa, New Sauchie and Collyland collieries. These reforms angered the miners, who stayed away from work. Bald's employer, John Francis Miller Erskine, 25th Earl of Mar, was forced to appeal to his zealous manager, who offered to either resign or take full responsibility for the running of the collieries when the lease expired in 1835. Bald took over the running of the Collyside, Woodlands and Devonside collieries according to his philanthropic principles, while a group of businessmen ran the Alloa colliery. Eventually, his business partners became concerned about his methods and withdrew from the venture, the collieries then passed into the hands of the men who ran the Alloa colliery. Bald's reputation for labour relations is somewhat equivocal; his aims may have been sound, but his methods were not so popular. Bald was a firm supporter of the Earl of Shaftesbury's Mines and Collieries Bill of 1842 that prohibited the employment of women and girls in mines and sought to regulate the employment of boys and improve safety conditions in the mines. Testimony of female coal bearers he had collected in 'An Inquiry into the condition of those women who carry coals underground in Scotland, known by the name of Bearers' (1808) had been used in the Children's Employment Commission earlier that year. Bald's obituary published in The Gentleman's Magazine, wrote that alongside Lord Ashley, the Earl of Shaftesbury, he did much to stop the employment of women 'bearers' in mines and to generally improve the condition of the mining community. Bald was also one of more than 2,000 people who met at the West Church in 1838 to campaign for the abolition of the system of apprenticeship in the West Indies. The meeting attendees included the Lord Provost and other city dignitaries, as well as those connected with the Emancipation Society. Bald is reported as seconding the first resolution against the evils of apprenticeship, which was called for the abolition of a system that was but slavery under another name."

After graduation, she was recruited by the Army Signal Intelligence Service to work as a code breaker, at the recommendation of the Dean of Russell Sage. She worked on IBM machines, starting with sorting paper, but quickly rose through the ranks. Caracristi was sent to Washington, D.C., she attended the cryptanalysis courses of William Friedman where puzzles were used to train cryptographers in the art of pattern recognition. During World War II, Caracristi's cryptography work was focused on deciphering the additive systems used by Japanese military forces and merchant fleet. She was known for her exceptional talent at reconstructing enemy code books. She and her colleagues were among the first Americans to learn of Japan's planned surrender, having deciphered the code on August 14, 1945. Following the war, Caracristi was hired at an agency that would later become part of the National Security Agency. She was promoted first to supergrade, a higher civil service paygrade, in 1959, and then to GS-18 (the highest supergrade) as the Chief of Research and Operations in 1975. In 1980, Caracristi became the sixth NSA Deputy Director, the first woman to serve in this role. She received the Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award in 1980, the highest award given to civilians. As Deputy Director, she was credited with providing leadership for new generations of code breakers and integrating the use computers and technology. Colleagues described her as an inspired leader. She preferred to be remembered for her operational accomplishments rather than her gender.\u00a0 She was one of the first women at the National Security Agency to be promoted to a \"super-grade,\" the equivalent of the modern Senior Executive Service; the first woman to be chief of a major operations group; and she was the first Deputy Director of NSA. She retired in 1982, but continued to serve on panels for the Intelligence Community, including President Clinton\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (appointed 1993). In 2003, Caracristi was given an honorary degree by the National Intelligence University, where an academic award in her name is given to a high-performing graduate student each year. She lived most of her adult life in an 18th-century one-bedroom cottage at 1222 28th Street NW in Georgetown, and her hobbies included birds and collecting pewter.

        "content": "He was born in Mantua, the third son of Francesco II Gonzaga and Isabella d'Este. At the age of sixteen he was sent to the court of Spain as a page to the future emperor Charles V, to whom Ferrante remained faithful for his whole life. In 1527 he took part in the Sack of Rome and attended Charles' triumphant coronation at Bologna in 1530: at the death of Charles of Bourbon (1527) he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Imperial army in Italy. He became a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1531. He defended Naples from the assault of the French troops under Odet of Foix, Viscount of Lautrec, and obtained the surrender of the Republic of Florence. For this feat Pope Clement VII, a member of the Medici who had been ousted from that city, named him papal governor of Benevento. Again for Charles V, he fought against the Turks at Tunis in 1535 and Algiers in 1541 with a contingent of 3,000 cavalry. He served Charles as Viceroy of Sicily (1535\u20131546), and Forte Gonzaga was named in his honour. He accompanied the Emperor to Germany in 1543 and fought the resolute campaign that enforced the Treaty of Cr\u00e9py. He then served as Governor of the Duchy of Milan (1546\u20131554), in which role he fought in the War of Parma. In 1529 Ferrante married Isabella di Capua, who brought him the fiefdoms of Molfetta and Giovinazzo. In 1539 he bought the countship of Guastalla, on the left bank of the Po for 22,280 golden scudi from Countess Ludovica Torelli; it was in part a strategic purchase, for Guastalla lies near Ferrara, which Charles wished to take from the Este. Ferrante's villa near Milan, La Gualtiera, is now known as La Simonetta. Ferrante rebuilt it in the 1550s, commissioning the services of the Tuscan architect Domenico Giuntallodi of Prato. Ferrante was a patron and protector of the sculptor and medallist Leone Leoni, who executed a bronze medal for him about 1555, with a reverse that depicts Hercules with upraised club besting the Nemean Lion and the legend TV NE CEDE MALIS, \"You do not yield to evil\", alluding to his acquittal after indictment for misappropriation of funds and corruption. His son Cesare commissioned from Leone a more public monument from Leone, a bronze Triumph of Ferrante Gonzaga over Envy, (1564), which stands in Piazza Roma, Guastalla. Like all the Gonzaga, Ferrante was a patron of tapestry-makers: a series Fructus Belli (\"the Fruits of War\") was woven for him, and a lighter series of Putti. He died in Brussels from a fall from a horse and battle fatigue received at the Battle of St. Quentin. He was buried in the sacristy of the Mantua Cathedral. Ferrante was succeeded in Guastalla by his son Cesare. He was the ambassador to Henry VIII of England in 1543."

Despite being born in the United States, Muoneke represents Nigeria internationally. Muoneke attended Cypress Falls High School in northwest Houston, Texas. After graduation, he enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin, from which he graduated in 2000 with his degree in Petroleum Engineering. After starting for 4 years on the school's basketball team, Muoneke went undrafted out of college. He is ranked in the top 15 in the history of University of Texas basketball in both scoring and rebounding. He was a first round pick of the Columbus Riverdragons (now Austin Spurs) then the Roanoke Dazzle also of the NBDL. He has played in multiple NBA summer leagues including that of the Vancouver Grizzlies and the New Orleans Hornets. Muoneke also signed non-guaranteed NBA contracts with the Detroit Pistons, Houston Rockets, Charlotte Bobcats and the Utah Jazz but was waived from all four teams. Muoneke has played around the world, including with the Ponce Lions in Puerto Rico, P\u0131nar Kar\u015f\u0131yaka in Turkey, the Beijing Olympians in China, Busan KTF Magic Wings, Seoul SK Knights in South Korea, Caceres in Spain and Saba Battery in Iran, among other places. Since November 2007, Muoneke has been maintaining a blog on Hoopshype.com, where he discusses his playing career, life in foreign countries, and politics. In Winter 2007-08 he signed a contract with '07-'08 ACB Champion and Euroleague Final Four Participant, Saski Baskonia of the Spanish ACB to replace the injured James Singleton. When the contract expired, the team's renewal offer was not accepted by Muoneke and both parties mutually parted ways. During his time in China, Muoneke broke many scoring records and was amongst the top scorers in China in all three of his seasons in the country. While playing for the Yunnan Running Bulls, Muoneke was physically attacked during a postgame confrontation between himself and Chinese national team captain and Shanghai Sharks player Liu Wei. After Muoneke and the Sharks' Cai Liang wrestled for the ball during the game, Cai, Liu and some Sharks players confronted Muoneke, his wife, children and mother-in-law as they were leaving the stadium. Muoneke had a water bottle thrown at him, before being chased and cornered by the players. Liu and Cai were subsequently fined and suspended. The Shanghai Sharks were also fined. Muoneke was not injured. He signed with ASVEL Villeurbanne for the 2008-09 season, but was released in September.  He then signed with the Utah Jazz but was waived in October. On his blog in 2009, he alluded to a retirement from professional basketball  and subsequently did retire at the age of 30. Muoneke then continued his career in African oil and gas in 2010 and has apparently started his own company in his parents' home country of Nigeria."

        "content": "Born into a family of physicians, Braunberger at the age of seven was already determined not have the same life as his father, and not to take up medicine as a career. He saw a screening of Fant\u00f4mas at the Gaumont Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, the first cinema to open in Paris, and decided to work in the cinema. After the First World War, at the age of 15, he produced and directed his first film: Frankfurt in Germany. He left for successive adventures in Berlin, London at Brocklis establishments, where he worked. In 1923, he left for New York, where he worked for a few weeks at Fox Film Corporation, and became a director of production along with Ferdinand H. Adam where he also worked on films with Frank Merrill. In the course of his films in Los Angeles, he came to know Irving Thalberg who employed him at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as one of his assistants. He stayed there for eighteen months, and established contacts with one of the greatest directors of the time. Wanting to direct and produce in France, he returned to Paris and got to know Jean Renoir, with whom he worked on Avec qui il va tourner, The Whirlpool of Fate, Nana and Tire-au-flanc. In 1929, Braunberger created Productions Pierre Braunberger and N\u00e9ofilms for the production of his first French-speaking film (La route est belle by Robert Florey). In 1930, Braunberger became head of the Pantheon Cinema and continued there for sixty years. He renovated the lobby, created 450 seats, and installed Western Electric projectors and sound equipment. Although subtitles were yet to be invented, he was the first to show foreign films in their original versions. One year later, he met with Roger Richeb\u00e9 to produce under the name of \u00c9tablissements Braunberger-Richeb\u00e9. A few films were produced, such as le Blanc et le noir by Robert Florey, Isn't Life a Bitch? by Jean Renoir, and Chocolati\u00e8re et Fanny by Marc All\u00e9gret. In 1933, still only 28, he decided to continue alone, and formed studios de Billancourt, which became Paris-Studio-Cin\u00e9ma. During World War two he was not able to produce a film because he was Jewish. At the end of the Second World War, Braunberger transformed a local Gestapo office into the Cinema Studio  \"Studio Lhmond\", which he used to discover new talents of the \"nouvelle vague\", including Jean-Pierre Melville, Jean-Luc Godard and Alain Resnais. In 1966 he was the head of the jury at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival. Braunberger had a close relationship with philosopher Gilles Deleuze. In the late 1970s, Braunberger produced two films for Polish filmmaker Walerian Borowczyk. Braunberger died in 1990."

He coached at Panini Modena 1985-1989 and led them to four Italian national championships in 1986-1989. In 1989 he was appointed head coach of the Italy men's national team leading them to unprecedented successes. His first trophy with the Italian team was at the 1989 Men's European Volleyball Championship in Sweden, where they topped their preliminary group with only one loss and went through the knockout stage up to the final where they beat 3-1 the host side to win their first ever official tournament. But it was in 1990 that Velasco helped Italy to reach the top the world, leading them to win the World Championship in Brazil: in the knockout stage Italy beat Argentina 3-0 in the quarterfinals, the host Brazil 3-2 in the semifinals and eventually Cuba 3-1 in the championship final to win their first ever title as world champions. During his tenure as Italy's coach Velasco won two more European Championships, another World Championship and five World Leagues, in addition to other minor trophies like the FIVB World Grand Champions Cup, Mediterranean Games, FIVB World Cup and World Super Challenge. Velasco also took the Italian men\u2019s team to win its first silver medal history FIPAV in the 1996 Summer Olympics. After the 1996 Summer Olympics, where the Italians won silver, he switched to the Italy women's team, from 1996 to 1997, coaching them to a Gold Medal at the Mediterranean Games. He coached the Czech Republic men's national team in 2001. He returned to Italy to coach the Copra Piacenza club in 2002. In 2008 he was selected to coach the Spain men's national team, winning with them the 2009 European Volleyball League. In 2011, Velasco was signed as the head coach of the Iran men's national team. He became coach of the Argentina men's national team before his contract with the Iranian national team expired on 1 March 2014, after winning two Asian Championships. This change of teams was due to the request of the people and the president of Argentina, and was approved by the Iranian volleyball confederation because of Iranians\u2019 respect for their coach. He led the Argentinian team to win the 2015 Pan American Games. Velasco was appointed head coach of Modena Volley for the 2018/2019 season."

Recently  his  teammate and friend Sunil Chhetri told the media that Renedy is the best midfielder in the country but also the most under-rated and  unnoticed Indian footballer. Renedy and Sunil Chetri were prominent figures in JCT FC squad, they  helped  JCT FC finish second and third in National Football League 2006-2007 and I-League 2007\u201308. He has his roots to Sekmai, a well known Football hub. He is India's very own dead-ball specialist and one of the most experienced members of the 2011 Asian Cup squad. Like many other current Indian internationals, Renedy is a graduate of the famous TFA academy in Jamshedpur. He spent six years there before signing his first professional contract with East Bengal in 1997. Renedy's performances from midfield with the red and gold brigade earned him his first senior international cap in 98, when he was only 19. By 2000, Renedy established himself as one of the best freekick takers in the country and was signed by Mohun Bagan. Arguably the best stage of his career was with the Mariners as he played an influential role during their 2001-02 National League triumph. Renedy's ability to cross the ball with both feet made him a mainstay in the Indian national team, especially after his excellent displays in India's 2002 LG Cup success. Injuries saw a dip in his form and he incredibly joined Chirag United, then known was Everyday and were not in the top flight, in 2004 after leaving Bagan. However he continued to do well for the Indian team and was actually top scorer in India's dismal 2006 World Cup qualification campaign with two goals. Renedy's club career got revived after he joined JCT in 2005 as he helped the Phagwara-based club finish second in the National League in the 06\u201307 season. Renedy joined  East Bengal for the second time in his career in 2008 but was never a regular there because of injuries and lack of match fitness. He did however star in a couple of big Kolkata derbies by providing assists with his superb delivery from set pieces. Renedy has been a key member of the Indian team during Bob Houghton's tenure but since the 2009 Nehru Cup he has not been a regular in the first eleven because of the problems he has had with injury. His best individual moment so far in the Bob Houghton era was without the doubt the delightful curling freekick he scored against Syria in the 2009 Nehru Cup final. After having a forgettable 2010 season with East Bengal, he was released by the club. He continued to be a regular in the Indian National Football Team and showed some skill which made people remember what he is capable of. After representing India in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, he agreed a contract with Baichung Bhutia's own club United Sikkim FC in the I-League 2nd Division. On 16 January 2011 Singh had officially signed for Shillong Lajong of the I-League. On 27 February 2015, he joined Bulgarian side CSKA Sofia on loan from Kerala Blasters, being the first Indian to sign for a Bulgarian club. However, he did not make any official appearances for the team, which was facing serious financial difficulties at the time."

        "content": "Thomas took up high jump in January 2006 while studying at Lindenwood University in Saint Charles, Missouri, where he played on the University's basketball team. He tried high jump for the first time when challenged by members of the track and field team, who were reacting to his claims about his ability to slam dunk. Thomas cleared 6'6\" (1.98 m) on his first attempt and 7' (2.13 m) on his third ever jump. The athletes then sought the head track coach Lane Lohr, who entered Thomas in a meet two days later at Eastern Illinois University. At the meet he cleared 7'3.25\" (2.22 m), on his seventh-ever jump. In March 2006, Thomas placed second at the 2006 NAIA Indoor Track & Field National Championships with a height of 7'1.75\" (2.18 m). Later that month, just two months after taking up high jump, he finished fourth at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne with a jump of 2.23 m. Not yet experienced at high jump, Thomas gained notoriety at the Commonwealth Games for not measuring his run-up, competing in shoes without spikes, and putting his arms behind his back to land on the mat as if breaking his fall. During the 2007 indoor season he cleared 2.30 metres for the first time and in March jumped 2.33 metres in Fayetteville, Arkansas. In July 2007 he cleared 2.35 metres in Salamanca, Spain. The result was a new personal best and the world season's best at the time. He then won the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan, again with a 2.35 jump. He also won gold at the 2007 IAAF World Athletics Final. That year he also won the IAAF Newcomer of the Year, and the Bahamas Amateur Athletic Association Athlete of the Year. The Olympics in 2008, however, turned out a major disappointment for Thomas. He made only 2.20 in the qualifying round and finished 21st overall. Thomas won the gold medal in the high jump at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India. In the final he was the only competitor to clear the height of 2.32, which he managed at the first attempt. The silver medal in the event was won by his countryman Trevor Barry. In 2011, he won the gold medal in the high jump at the Pan American Games in Guadalajara, Mexico, again with a height of 2.32. Thomas competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom. In qualification he cleared 2.16, passed on 2.21, then failed to clear 2.26 and did not advance to the final. Thomas represented the Bahamas at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He made the final for the first time at an Olympic competition and finished in equal 7th place with a jump of 2.29. He competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics."

Listed at . 170\u00a0lb., he batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He was born in Jenison, Michigan. McCoy was 22 years old when he entered the majors in September 1938 with the Detroit Tigers, appearing in seven games while hitting a .200 batting average (3-for-15). In 1939, though he played just two months for Detroit after Charlie Gehringer was injured, McCoy hit .302 with 33 runs batted in and 38 runs scored in 55 games played. At the end of the season, he was dealt by the Tigers to the Philadelphia Athletics in exchange for Wally Moses. McCoy was among 91 Detroit minor league players declared free agents by baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. The Tigers had been blocking players in their minor league system for years, players with major league skills, which was a fairly common practice in those days as there were only 16 big league clubs and precious few jobs. For a middle infielder, McCoy was a very good offensive player, but Detroit had Gehringer and he was blocked in the minors. With the deal canceled, McCoy had bids from ten major-league clubs. The Washington Senators offered him a bonus of $20,000, the New York Giants raised it to $25,000, the Brooklyn Dodgers to $35,000, and the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds to $40,000. McCoy, who got $15 for his first major league season and thought his $5,000 in 1939 was big money, accepted the Philadelphia Athletics'offer: a $45,000 bonus, a two-year contract at $10,000 a year, and a regular job at second base under the tutorial guidance of manager Connie Mack. His was not only the biggest bonus in major league history, $20,000 more than the previous top, given Rick Ferrell by the St. Louis Browns in 1929, but it made McCoy the highest-paid bigleaguer of the year. His 1940 income of $55,000 will be more than the salary of Joe Di Maggio, Jimmy Foxx or Hank Greenberg. McCoy played in 1940 and 1941 with the Athletics. His most productive season came in 1941, when he hit .271 with 61 RBI and posted career-highs in games (141), hits (140), walks (95), runs (86), home runs (8), and triples (7). He spent the next four years in the US Navy during World War II. When he returned from service, his skills had eroded and he never played another game. In a four-season career, McCoy was a .269 hitter (327-for-1214) with 16 home runs and 156 RBI in 337 games, including 182 runs, 327 hits, 52 doubles, 18 triples, and eight stolen bases. A selective and patient hitter, he posted a solid .384 on-base percentage and a respectable 1.56 strikeout-to-walk ratio (190-to-122). McCoy played in the  National Baseball Congress with the St Joseph's Autos team in 1946. Before his death, he was recognized as one of the oldest living major league ballplayers. McCoy died on his 96th birthday on November 9, 2011."

The partnership lasted until 1839 when Charles sold his interest to start his own business. As a nurseryman, Downing was known for his cultivation skill and trustworthiness. Published in 1845, he worked with his brother to write The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America. After Andrew's death in 1852, Downing edited and added new material and reissued The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America. Each new edition greatly enlarged the book and it was the best publication of the kind in the United States. In 1850, left his nursery and began to research and experiment with fruit varieties. His test orchard contained 1,800 varieties of apples and 1,000 varieties of pears. He also worked with cultivating a variety of grapes in New York state. He was regarded as one of the foremost pomologists of his day. He also wrote many articles upon horticultural subjects under the initials \"C. D.\" His work throughout was conscientious and accurate, and he was internationally recognized as an authority upon pomology, horticulture, and tree growths. Quiet, modest, and retiring, although an active member of horticultural societies, he would never make a public speech. In 1870, Downing traveled with Marshall P. Wilder, Patrick Barry, and George Ellwanger to California and published about their journey in Tilton's Journal. The California Farmer and Journal of Useful Sciences printed their report in seven articles. Their report transformed the horticultural landscape through the realization of the optimal growing conditions, vast acreage, large fruits, and exotic plants of California."

Because he was Jewish, he was stripped of his titles, and, in July 1933, the Nazis threatened that if he dared fight another match to defend his titles he would be killed. Seelig fled to France, though his stripped titles were never restored.  He had a successful boxing career in America from 1935-40."

Barred by the Nazis from defending his title and threatened with death if he fought to defend them, Eric and his parents then fled to France.  Seelig competed in France for a few years, also boxing in Belgium and England.  He emigrated to the United States via Cuba in 1935. In his remaining career, he fought nearly every top middleweight contender of his era.  He enjoyed success in the U.S. compiling a career record of 57 bouts, 40 victories (9 KOs), 7 draws, and 10 losses, and he would fight against several champions including reigning IBU world middleweight champion Marcel Thil, former world middleweight champion Freddy Yarosz, world middleweight champion Fred Apostoli, and reigning world middleweight champion Al Hostak.   One of his highest rankings in The Ring was #6 in 1938, though he would climb as high as #5 between 1935-40. On May 22, 1933, Seelig fought an important bout against IBU world middleweight champion Marcel Thil at the Palais de Sports in Paris, losing in a twelve-round points decision. Thil was also the former holder of the NBA world middleweight title, and would later hold the European light heavyweight title in 1934. By a few accounts, Seelig's May bout with Thil was for the world title, but the boxers were overweight according to Le Petit Parisien.  On January 29, 1934, Seelig fought Marcel Thil again in Paris, losing in a twelve-round points decision."

        "content": "In his first fight in American on September 11, 1935, he knocked out Italian Al Rossi in the eighth round at St. Nicholas Arena. Seelig blasted Rossi around the ring for seven rounds with both lefts and rights, backing him into the ropes, and landing dangerous hooks.  Fifty-five seconds into the eighth, Seelig threw his signature overhand right to the jaw of Rossi and ended the bout. Lacking boxing science and appearing wild at times when he took head shots while wading in, Seelig continued his attack, nonetheless, and rocked Rossi with hooks to the face and damaging blows to the midsection. In only his second bout in New York, Seelig knocked out Charley Bellanger on November 11, 1935 to a winning reception, fifty-two seconds into the fourth round at New York's St. Nicholas arena.  An overhand right to the point of the jaw, preceded by a storm of lightning fast blows to the head and body, dropped Bellanger for the count.  After Seelig was momentarily down to one knee from a terrific right hook to the jaw, he fought cautiously, realizing that long range fighting would not be his best bet against Bellanger who had a slight advantage in reach.   Another right to the chin put Bellanger down momentarily in the second.  The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, wrote, \"a fighting heart, a will to win and two strong arms that keep whirling like a windmill...have combined to enlist the hearts of American fighting fans to his side.\"  The New York crowd gave him an enormous hand at the end of the bout."

A bad cut over Walker's left eye caused the referee to call the fight 2:31 into the seventh round.  Seelig was in front by a wide margin when the fight was called. Seelig won a unanimous fifteen-round decision against leading contender Paul Pirrone in Cleveland, Ohio, on December 16, 1935, retaining his standings in the top ten world middleweights.  He came back to win after being knocked down in the second round by a stiff punch to the chin.  In a clear cut victory, Seelig continued to box well after fracturing his hand in the fifth round.  It was his fourth win since arriving in America.<ref>\"Pirrone Bested by Eric Seelig\", Dayton Daily News\", pg. 21, 17 December 1935</ref> On May 10, 1938, Seelig lost to highly rated contender Billy Conn in a ten-round mixed decision at the Motor Square Garden in Pittsburgh.  Conn would become a world light heavyweight champion the following year.  In close bout before a modest crowd of 1,200, Seelig was given three rounds, Conn took five, and two were declared even.  Seelig blasted Conn in the sixth with a right uppercut that sent him to the ropes.  Conn dominated the last three rounds with high pressured infighting that smothered Seelig, and gave a significant points advantage to Conn.  Conn held a slight advantage in the infighting, with a five-inch advantage in height, giving him roughly a three-inch or ten centimeter advantage in reach. Seelig outpointed Carmen Barth on October 14, 1938, at Legion Stadium in Hollywood before a crowd of 4,500.  In the infighting, though  suffering from a slight reach disadvantage, Seelig scored with frequent left hooks and right crosses, and in the seventh Seelig had Barth shaking at the knees but could not put him to the canvas for a knockout.  Seelig dropped the first round from a foul, but used his vicious left hook to gain a points advantage in six of the ten rounds with three to Barth, according to the Los Angeles Times.\"German Gains Nod Over Carmen Barth\", Salt Lake Telegram, Salt Lake City, Utah, pg. 11, 15 October 1938  Barth had defeated Seelig one year earlier in an eight-round decision in Cleveland on December 6, 1937.  In April 1937, Seelig defeated Barth in a ten-round points decision at Public Hall in Cleveland in what the Ring'' magazine described as \"one of the greatest fights in the history of the fight game.\" Seelig defeated future NYSAC world middleweight champion Ken Overlin on December 20, 1938 in a close ten round unanimous points decision before 8,100, at New York Colliseum in the Bronx.  Seelig lost the third as the results of a low punch, but took the first two on hard rights to the head and body, but after the fourth, he lost ground with continuous body punches from Seelig, which the crowd may not have noticed.  In the last two rounds, Overlin switched to blows to the head, and scored again, but was too far behind in scoring to take the decision.  There were no knockdowns in the bout.  Seelig lost to Overlin in a ten-round points decision at Chicago Stadium on June 8, 1939.  Seelig showed more aggression which won him fans in the audience, but Overlin landed more effective punches and allowed him to win decisively. Seelig drew with Teddy Yarosz, former world middleweight champion, before a crowd of 7,937, on February 3, 1939 at New York's shrine to boxing, Madison Square Garden in an eight-round bout, but still retained a top ten world standing among middleweights.  In the second, the close bout saw Yarosz drop Seelig for a two count.  Seelig evened up the bout by scoring repeatedly in close fighting."

In 1958 and 1959, having been awarded the Sir James Knott Travelling Scholarship, he completed his studies by travel in France, Italy and Greece, being influenced by the sculptural masters such as Michelangelo and Donatello and by the simplicity of form in Cycladic art. In 1961, he was appointed Lecturer in Sculpture at Newcastle-upon-Tyne College of Art and when this merged into Newcastle-upon-Tyne Polytechnic 9 years later (1970). He became a Principal Lecturer and Head of Sculpture before retiring from teaching in 1984. He has been a member of various bodies, such as the Art and Architects Department of the Bishops Conference of England and Wales (1972\u201377), the Fabrics Advisory Committee of St. Nicholas' Cathedral, Newcastle-upon Tyne (1991\u201394), and the Advisory Committee for Historic Churches in the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle (1995\u20132000).

Her mother was poet and doll artist Margaret Rockwell Finch  and her father, Henry Leroy Finch, Jr., was a pacifist leader and a scholar of philosophy whose works include three books on Ludwig Wittgenstein.  Her great-aunt was the socialist organizer, politician, and writer Jessie Wallace Hughan. Finch began writing poetry as a child. She was educated in public schools, then for two years at Oakwood Friends School and one year at Simon's Rock Early College, where she studied filmmaking and art history.  At Yale University she studied poetry, anthropology, the history of the English language with Marie Borroff, and Versification with Penelope Laurans, graduating magna cum laude in 1979. After traveling in Africa with painter Alix Bacon, in the early eighties she settled in New York's East Village, where she worked at Natural History Magazine and self-published and performed the rhythmical experimental longpoemThe Encyclopedia of Scotland.  In 1984, Finch encountered the work of Ntozake Shange in a bookstore and \"recognized in her a soul-mother, someone else for whom poetry was performative, sacred, curative, indispensable, physical.\" She immediately applied to the University of Houston, where Shange was teaching, and earned her M.A. in creative writing there in 1985 with a thesis in Verse Drama directed by Shange. Finch earned a Ph.D in English and American Literature from Stanford University in 1990, studying feminist theory with Adrienne Rich and pursuing a self-designed concentration in Versification under the supervision of Diane Middlebrook."

Calendars (Tupelo Press, 2003), finalist for the National Poetry Series and shortlisted for the Forward Poetry Book of the Year award, is structured around a series of poems written for performance to celebrate the Wheel of the Year.  Her third book, Among the Goddesses: An Epic Libretto in Seven Dreams (Red Hen Press, 2010), which received the Sarasvati Award for Poetry, is a hybrid work combining narrative and dramatic structure to tell a mythic story about abortion. The Encyclopedia of Scotland was published in 2010 by Salt Publishing in the U.K.; in the same year, Carnegie Mellon University Press reissued Eve in the Contemporary Classics Poetry Series. Spells: New and Selected Poems (Wesleyan University Press, 2012), collects poems from each of Finch's previous books along with previously unpublished poems. The Poetry Witch Little Book of Spells (2019), also from Wesleyan University Press, offers small spells of fewer than eight lines, gathered by Finch from the longer poems of Spells.

        "content": "Finch's dedication to writing in meter and her role as a scholar, editor, and critic of poetic form led some reviewers of her first books to classify her poetry within the movement known as New Formalism. Dictionary of Literary Biography named her \"one of the central figures in contemporary American poetry\" for her role in the reclamation of poetic form. But reviewers soon noticed key differences between Finch's poetry and that of other new formalist poets. Henry Taylor, for example, claimed that Finch was not a typical new formalist because she did not focus on the realities of contemporary life, and C.L. Rawlins emphasized the incantatory use of form in Eve, writing, \"Finch is a poet in her bones . . . . What she proves in Eve is that rhyme-and-meter isn't just a formerly fashionable sort of bondage, but a bioacoustic key to memory and emotion.\"  Cindy Williams Gutierrez made a similar point in a review of a later book: \u201cFinch is more shaman than formalist. She is keenly aware of the shape and sound of her poems. Whether in a chant, sonnet, ghazal, or even Billy Collins\u2019 contrived paradelle, her skill is effortless: Form is merely the skin that allows her poems to breathe with ease.\u201d Poet and critic Ron Silliman has situated Finch in the context of experimental poetry, writing, \"Annie Finch can't be a new formalist, precisely because she's passionate both about the new and about form. She is also one of the great risk-takers in contemporary poetry, right up there with Lee Ann Brown & Bernadette Mayer in her willingness to completely shatter our expectations as readers.\"  The experimental aspect of Finch's work became more evident with the publication of Spells, which includes 35 of the poems composed in the 1980s that she refers to as the \"lost poems.\" In the preface to Spells, she describes these as \"metrical and experimental poems [that]. . . did not find their audience until the avant-garde's rediscovery of formal poetic strategies just a few years ago.\" Reviewing Calendars, poet and Goddess scholar Patricia Monaghan was one of the first critics to articulate the intersection of formal poetics and spirituality in Finch's work, writing, \"Annie Finch is a traditionalist. Not in the way the word is commonly used . . . but in a strange experimental way.  An oracle, an ecstatic maenad: that is the kind of traditional poet Annie Finch is.\" Finch's literary archive was purchased by the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University in 2016."

        "title": "Annie Finch_Feminism and spirituality",
        "content": "In the preface to Spells: New and Selected Poems (2013), Finch writes, \"Compiling this book has led me to appreciate how much I was inspired as a poet by coming of age during the feminist movement of the 1970s. Reading it has helped me understand the ways I struggled over the years to throw off the burden of misogyny on my spiritual, psychological, intellectual, political, and poetic identities. My themes are often female-centered . . . I am proud to define myself as a woman poet.\" Finch's feminism is also evident in her prose writing, editing, and literary organizing. Her first anthology A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women (1993) collected poems and essays by contemporary women poets. The \"metrical code,\" the central theory of her book of literary criticism The Ghost of Meter (1994), is cited in the article on \"feminist poetics\" by Elaine Showalter in the Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics.   Her essay collection The Body of Poetry: Essays on Women, Form, and the Poetic Self (2005) includes writings on women poets including Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Carolyn Kizer, Maxine Kumin, Audre Lorde, Lydia Sigourney, Sara Teasdale, and Phillis Wheatley, many based in feminist theory. In 1997, Finch founded the international listserv Discussion of Women Poets (Wom-Po).  She facilitated the listserv until 2004 when she passed ownership of the list to Amy King. In October 2016, anticipating the #MeToo movement, Finch became one of the first victims of sexual assault in the literary world to name writers, editors, and teachers who had sexually assaulted her during her career. In 2019 Finch launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for the publication of Choice Words: Writers on Abortion, which the publisher, Haymarket Books, calls \"the first major literary anthology about abortion.\" The Kickstarter launched two days before Alabama passed an abortion ban and reached its fundraising goal in the first week. Choice Words was published in April 2020. Claire Keyes notes in Scribner's American Writers, \"A strong current in [Finch's] work is the decentering of the self, a theme which stems from her deep connection with the natural world and her perception of the self as part of nature.\"  In an interview Finch stated, \"Some of my poems are lyric, some narrative, some dramatic, and some meditative, but all are concerned with the mystery of the embodied sacred.\".<ref>Finch, Annie. \"An Interview with Annie Finch.\" Poemeleon http://www.poemeleon.org/an-interview-with-annie-finch/</ref> Finch writes in the preface of her 2013 collection Spells: New and Selected Poems that she considers her poems and verse plays to be \"spells\" whose rhythm and form invite readers \"to experience words not just in the mind but in the body.\" Finch started a blog called American Witch in 2010  and has published several articles about earth-centered spirituality in The Huffington Post."

Both plays were collaborative productions incorporating music, dance, puppets, and masks.

Eliot, Audre Lorde, and other poets. Building on the work of Roland Barthes and on John Hollander's theory of \"the metrical frame,\" Finch calls her theory of metrical meanings \"the metrical code.\" The essay collection The Body of Poetry explores further topics in feminist poetics and poetic form including translation, \"Metrical Diversity,\" and readings of poets including Sara Teasdale, Phillis Wheatley, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Marilyn Hacker, and John Peck. Finch's edited or coedited anthologies of poetry and poetics include A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women, An Exaltation of Forms: Contemporary Poets on the Diversity of Their Art, Villanelles, and Measure for Measure: An Anthology of Poetic Meters. She has also authored a poetry-writing textbook, A Poet's Craft: A Comprehensive Guide to Making and Sharing Your Poetry. Palmer, G.M. \"Why We Read: Spells by Annie Finch, The Critical Flame, September 2013 At a time when Emily Dickinson was the only nineteenth-century woman poet receiving critical attention, Finch's 1987 article \"The Sentimental Poetess in the World: Metaphor and Subjectivity in Lydia Sigourney's Nature Poetry\" approached Sigourney through postmodern theories of the poetic self. A subsequent essay on Sigourney was commissioned for Lydia Sigourney: Critical Essays and Cultural Views (2018), which also included Finch's elegiac poem for Sigourney.  In the essay collection The Body of Poetry: Essays on Women, Form, and the Poetic Self, Finch discusses her ideas about \"poetess's poetics\" in broader terms"

        "content": "Carboni started his coaching career in 1998 with Serie D club Aglianese, leading his side to seventh place in the final standings. In 1999, he left Tuscany to coach Sardinian Serie D side Olbia, ending the season in fourteenth place. In October 2000 he was surprisingly appointed by Genoa chairman Gianni Scerni to replace Bruno Bolchi at the helm of the rossoblu in the Serie B. Carboni, lacking a valid coaching license for heading a Serie B club, guided the club jointly with veteran manager Alfredo Magni, but was sacked in January 2001 following a poor 17 points in 15 matches. In 2001-2002, Carboni was appointed at the helm of ambitious Serie C1 side Pisa, but failed to lead the club to a promotion spot, ending the season in a poor tenth place. He returned to Olbia the next season, but obtained an unimpressive fifteenth place in the Serie C2 table and escaped relegation only after playoffs. In 2003, he moved back in Serie C1, at Viterbese, obtaining a third place and allowing the gialloblu to gain a spot in the promotion playoff. From 2004 to 2006, Carboni coached Bari in the Serie B obtaining a twelfth and a thirteenth final place respectively. After Bari replaced him with Rolando Maran during the summer, he started the 2006-07 season without a job, being appointed in February 2007 as new Crotone boss following the dismissal of Elio Gustinetti in an attempt to avoid relegation which later proved to be unsuccessful. Following Crotone's relegation to Serie C1, Carboni left the Calabrian side, being later appointed at the helm of newly promoted Serie B side Avellino on August 23, 2007, being the third head coach signed by the biancoverdi in the 2007-08 season following resignations by Giovanni Vavassori and successively Maurizio Sarri, all apparingly caused by disputes with the club management. He was sacked in March 2008 due to poor results. In April 2009 he was appointed to replace Elvio Selighini at the helm of relegation-battling Serie B side Rimini, however failing to save his team from falling down to the lower tier after being defeated to Ancona in the relegation playoffs. On 25 April 2010, Frosinone announced that Carboni would be the new manager after a poor string of results led to the sacking of Francesco Moriero, leading the club to safety. A poor start in the 2010\u201311 campaign however led to Carboni's own dismissal later in January 2011. On 20 November 2011 Carboni becomes the new coach of Empoli in place of the sacked Giuseppe Pillon, until 12 February 2012 when he was sacked. On 18 January 2013 he was named new coach of Benevento. In December 2015 he replaced Gianluca Atzori as manager of Siena. On 13 November 2018 he was appointed head coach of Serie C club Olbia. He was fired on 7 January 2019 and replaced by Michele Filippi."

Mack was born in Greenock, Scotland, on 26 June 1934. He was educated at Lenzie Academy and Bathgate Academy. He worked for the Guardian Royal Exchange insurance company from 1956 until 1970; his broadcasting career started in 1965 on the pirate radio station Radio Scotland 242, which was closed down in 1967 under the provisions of the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act. Thereafter, he joined the BBC in Glasgow, including working as a DJ on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2's Night Ride programme. He moved to Kent, England, in 1970, becoming a presenter on the Chatham-based BBC Radio Medway (now BBC Radio Kent), plus occasional broadcasts on BBC Radio 2.

        "content": "Aiko is a soprano. Rap-Up says that she possesses \"gentle pop-tinged vocals\" and a \"sensually sweet voice\" while Jim Farber of the New York Daily News describes her voice as having a \"feathery tone, sky-high pitch and dazed delivery\" that floats \"above the beat, sexy and aloof\"; Farber has also said that Aiko is \"the female answer\" to Frank Ocean. Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork Media compared Aiko's vocals to those of R&B singers Cassie, Brandy, Ciara and, the late Aaliyah. Thematically Aiko's work contains direct and \"acute\" lyrics that can be sometimes \"girlish.\" Adam Fleischer of MTV described Aiko's lyrical content as being \"catchy and emotive\", continuing to note Aiko's lyrics as having no boundaries; which mix \"moments of sensitivity and love, but also moments of confusion and aggression.\" Jhene's musical style is associated with a new wave of music called PBR&B, which is described as emerging, stylistic alternative to contemporary R&B. Besides PBR&B, Aiko explores a variety of genres including psychedelic music, classic R&B and hip hop music. Aiko has described herself as being part of this movement, she noted her own musical style as being \"alternative\" and a \"new-generation R&B\", which she compared herself to the style of Frank Ocean, Miguel and Drake. Described by Erin Lowers a reviewer from XXL magazine, Aiko's music is alternative R&B, which the reviewer described as being created with the use of heavily used synthesizers and \"wooly drum loops\", the reviewer continued to say that her genre is caught in a \"revolutionized limbo.\" Bradley Stern of Time, compared the Aiko's musical style to the work of Sade, calling the album's genre \"future R&B\", Stern continued to compare her music to the work of The Weeknd, Tinashe and FKA twigs. Aiko writes music every day, often writing lines or a poem, and begins to add them to melodies. She describes her writing style as \"freestyle,\" where she just says how she is feeling, taking a day or up to a month to complete.  Jhene Aiko is noted for being an author to her first published book 2Fish(2017).This book contains a collection of poems, songs, and drawings she's created from the age of twelve up to the books publication date. Aiko reveals several lyrical verses in her book that can be found in her album Trip which was released the same year as the publication of 2Fish. During the recording of the album Aiko opted to freestyle when writing the album, she would have a beat or would sit with producers and she would sing a melody until she had words, she described the process as not having a lot written  down saying \"there's not a lot of writing down\u2014I'll only write it down to make sure it makes sense after I come up with it. For the most part, I like to not have second thoughts.\" Aiko revealed that whilst writing music she enjoys being high in order to use the feeling as inspiration and that for the entire writing and recording process of her debut mixtape Sailing Soul(s), she was under the influence of cannabis. When writing for her debut studio album, she did the same but recorded while sober. Aiko places great importance on writing her music, believing it defines her as an artist: \"After each song I've lost like a piece of me, because I've put it in to (sic) the song.\" Singer Nick Jonas cited Aiko as an influence during the recording of his debut album, noting her alternative R&B sound as his influence."

Aiko also calls recording artist Kid Cudi, a major influence, stating Cudi is \"pretty much one of the only people that I listen to consistently. No matter what he puts out, I'm one of those fans. He can do no wrong in my eyes.\" Aiko also credits Brandy as a major influence, saying, \"I always say the person who taught me how to sing indirectly because I listened to her all the time was Brandy. I fell in love with her voice when I was six years old. I always loved Brandy.\" Aiko also listens to Beyonc\u00e9 to learn from her vocal technique and is also influenced by India.Arie and Amel Larrieux. Aiko is influenced by John Mayer saying \"He's probably one of my number one musical influences because of his writing ability and his voice.\" During the recording of her debut extended play \"Sail Out\" (2013), Aiko stated she took a large amount of influence from hip-hop and rap music notably the genre's beats.

Mailer's biographer Mary Dearborn says of those days:Adele thrived in the city. She frequented the Village bars, especially those, like the San Remo and the Cedar Tavern, favored by artists and writers, and she dressed in fantastic, gypsylike outfits. By all accounts, she had extraordinary physical presence. With striking dark good looks and a beautiful body, she seemed to exude sexuality.

But after visiting Paris in the summer of 1956 Mailer and Morales decided to leave New York; Mailer wrote \"the city was not alive for me. I was on edge. My wife was pregnant. It seemed abruptly too punishing to live at the pace we had been going for several years.\" In the fall of 1956 they moved to a rented \"sprawling white saltbox farmhouse\" in Bridgewater, Connecticut, near a literary and artistic community that included Arthur Miller and William Styron in nearby Roxbury. In 1957, she gave birth to her first daughter, Danielle. Although Adele was happy at first in the country, there was \"a constant low-level hostility between Norman and Adele, which got worse when they drank.\" They moved back to New York in the fall of 1958, renting an apartment at 73 Perry St. in the Village; Adele bore another daughter, Elizabeth Anne, in 1959. In the summer of 1960, in Provincetown, Massachusetts, Adele danced in a production called \"The Pirates of Provincetown,\" and James Baldwin praised her performance, \"though she had no lines beyond one scream, which she delivered with gusto in high 'method' style\"; later that summer she had to bail Norman out of jail after a drunken run-in with the police."

He was born without arms, though not because of Thalidomide which was an issue in the later 1950s and 1960s. Faced with the challenge of this disability his family was convinced to place him at 2 months old at the Good Shepherd Home (today the Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network) in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The main practice at Good Shepherd was mainstreaming and there they trained him in adapting the use of his legs and feet as arms and hand as well as an early prosthetic arms he later stopped using. Ravellette was not the first armless person to go through the Good Shepherd facility - that was Ray Meyers - who was an inspiration to Ravellette. Ravellette, while missing arms, favored his left foot like many do their left hand. Ravellete was known to entertain people with his use of feet and body to do tricks. While there Ravellette attended regular public school as well starting with Jefferson Elementary School and then South Mountain Junior High. At the age of 11 Ravellette suffered burns from a fire accident. At the age of 16 Ravellette rejoined his family partly because he was a discipline problem but was initially barred from attending high school by the principle - in the era, as Ravellette understood it, physical handicaps were equated with mental handicaps. Ravellette's mother sued the school and produced transcripts from his public school years while living at the Good Shepherd. However while attending high school Ravellete's reputation was not built because of his lack of arms as much as by his \"rebel\" confrontational attitude where he \"didn't back down\" when fellow students picked at his difference and towns people treated him differently - \"For the first time, I felt like I was a cripple.\" But living on a farm taught him to not be afraid of work. His family did not have running water and at one point it was his job to fill water troughs from a \"hand\" pump. For the high school prom Ravellette recalled he was denied a date saying \"Marty, when I want to get married I want to marry a man, not half a one.\""

In the same period Estes noticed he was much more agile with his feet and remarked \"If God has seen fit to put you on earth without arms, it's up to the rest of us to accept you - not you to accept us.\" which Ravellette took as a turning point in his life.

He appeared on national television shows like Discovery Channel (which won an Award of Merit by Carolina Silver Reels) and other shows though initially he had sought no publicity. Following this he had the opportunity to go back to the Good Shepherd for a reunion and began a period of reconnecting with his family while at the same time finding another with whom he would marry - African-American Maree. Additionally he began to speak to groups - for example he was a frequent guest at a journalism class of Chuck Stone at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as well as other opportunities using stories of his life and physical challenges to underpin larger lessons on the benefits of diversity, justice, equality, and the unity of humankind. Inspired by his beliefs as a long-time member of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, he would often quote one of his favorite lines from the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed sacred writings: \u201cNoble have I created thee; why hast thou abased thyself\" and observing that he was in a special position to serve humanity because of his differentness - \"Why was I born? Why was I born with no arms?\u2026 Now serve mankind with no arms and not yourself!\" During the filming of a documentary on his life published in 2003 he met Tony Melendez, a performer similarly armless, and his mother died the year it was published. The documentary was picked up by the Volunteer and Information Quinte advocacy network for disabled people and telecast on television subtitled in Romanian. Late morning on November 12, 2007, Ravellette was in a car accident in southern Alamance County, North Carolina at Highway 87 where the little town of Eli Whitney, North Carolina is and he failed to yield to an oncoming lumber truck. He was ejected from the vehicle because he did not wear a seatbelt because of his disability and died later that day at UNC Hospital just a few days after another Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed was similarly killed in an accident at the same intersection.

Miyata was born on April 1, 1954, in Tokyo and graduated from the Kunitachi College of Music, where she majored in piano. While in school, she began studying gagaku music from Ono Tadamaro of the Imperial Household Agency. Although the sh\u014d is generally associated with Japan's ancient gagaku court music, Miyata was among the first players of the instrument to specialize in contemporary classical music. She plays a specially constructed instrument with extra pipes, allowing for the use of more chromaticism. The US composer John Cage (1912\u20131992) composed a number of works for Miyata just before his death. Cage met her during the 1990 Darmstadt summer course. She has also premiered works by T\u014dru Takemitsu, Toshi Ichiyanagi, Maki Ishii, Joji Yuasa, Klaus Huber, Toshio Hosokawa, and Uro\u0161 Rojko. In 2005, Miyata performed in three songs by the Icelandic musician Bj\u00f6rk, for the soundtrack album to Drawing Restraint 9, a film by Bj\u00f6rk's contemporary media artist boyfriend Matthew Barney, about Japanese culture and whaling. Miyata also appeared in the film, playing the sh\u014d in one scene. Previously, one of Miyata's compositions, \"Music for Sh\u014d and Harp (Cort Lippe)\", was sampled in the Bj\u00f6rk single, \"Venus as a Boy\".

Andrew Steptoe (1984) has discussed the series of 21 letters Mozart wrote to Puchberg asking for loans. He notes that \"Mozart's early requests stress the bond of mutual aid and comfort,\" giving the following example: I have now opened my whole heart to you in a matter which is of the utmost importance to me; that is, I have acted as a true brother. But it is only with a true brother that one can be perfectly frank. And now I look forward eagerly to your reply, which I do hope will be favourable . . . I take you to be a man who ... will like myself certainly assist a friend, if he be a true friend, or his brother, if he be indeed a brother. [letter of 17 June 1788] \"Over the next year,\" Steptoe adds, \"Mozart's tone changed to desperation:\" Great God! I would not wish my worst enemy to be in my present position. And if you, most beloved friend and brother, forsake me, we are altogether lost, both my unfortunate and blameless self and my poor sick wife and child. [letter of 12 July 1789] Steptoe continues: \"At times, the composer's self-respect deserted him completely, as he begged for pittances:\" In a week or fortnight I shall be better off--certainly--but at present I am in want! Can you not help me out with a trifle? The smallest sum would be very welcome just now. [letter of 14 August 1790] However, in 2009 the musicologist Michael Lorenz showed that at the time when Mozart pretended to be in dire straits, he had certainly not reduced his expenses (as claimed in one of his letters to Puchberg), but lived in a spacious apartment on the Alsergrund that cost him 250 Gulden a year. At that time he also owned a carriage and a horse. Thus there is a good case to assume that Mozart might have vastly exaggerated his financial problems just to get money from Puchberg."

He attended Greenfield Street Boys' Secondary Modern School in Hyde, Cheshire. West began his career at Burnley, a product of the club's prolific youth system. In 1973, he was set for a move to Sunderland but was told by medical staff that he had a condition which meant he would be crippled if he continued playing. He believed there was nothing wrong, and moved to Luton Town that year. He spent eight seasons at Luton Town, becoming an important player as well as club captain. West made his name as a cultured midfielder who though not prolific was a fine passer of the ball. He was ever-present in his one top-flight season with the Hatters (1974\u201375). In 1976, he moved the Minnesota Kicks of the North American Soccer League, playing with the team through the 1979 season. Moving to Millwall in 1981, West spent two seasons there before moving on to non-League football - as manager of Isthmian League strugglers Hitchin Town, being sacked in September 1988 after a poor start to the season. West is now a pastor at a local church in Luton, named Luton Christian Fellowship. He is also the Club Chaplain at Luton Town Football Club."

He taught elementary and middle school at Palm Crest Elementary School and Foothill Intermediate School in La Canada, California from 1961\u20131964.  His leadership in the classroom was respected and this led to his promotion to Assistant Middle School Principal at that same Foothill Intermediate School from 1964\u20131965.  In 1965, he moved up to Middle School Principal and Central Project Director, Temple City USD, Temple City, California. It was during his five years at Temple City that he started to formulate his ideas into writing.  His observations in the classroom and school became the groundwork for his first book Differentiated staffing: Giving teaching a chance to improve learning published in 1969. The book was well received, and it was not long before he was putting his theories into practice.  In 1970 he was asked to direct a project in staff differentiation with three pilot schools in the Mesa Public Schools District in Mesa, Arizona.  The project was funded by Arizona State University where English was employed with the title of Project Director/Visiting Lecturer. In essence he was conducting practical research by being allowed to reorganize each pilot school along slightly different models and then measure performance differences.  This work was the topic of his Doctoral Dissertation, and he received his Ph.D. in 1972. There was a clear improvement of student performance due to organization and differentiation of staff.  The positive results were published in two books  Strategies for Differentiated Staffing (1972) and School Organization and Management (1975). What worked in Arizona on the small scale would get its true test in the Sarasota County, Florida district schools.  English was hired as the Assistant Superintendent for Personnel and Program Development by that district.  At 25,000 students, the implementation was more difficult but just as effective as in Arizona."

Arlington, Virginia.  Although this position was honorary, it gave him exposure to people and movements within education at the national level.  It also gave him the opportunity to plan and direct two national summer conferences in Minneapolis and Denver. He documented his ideas and work in his books School Organization and Management, Needs Assessment: A focus for Curriculum Development and Quality Control in Curriculum Development. In Washington, D.C. in the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter's administration was moving for the creation of a cabinet-level Department of Education.  Consultants were needed who knew education at the practical level.  In 1979 English was hired by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. (KPMG Peat Marwick) as their National Practice Director, North American Continent, for Elementary and Secondary Education, in the firm's Washington, D.C. Office. The consulting business opened English's eyes to a whole new set of tools.  Business auditing and accounting practices were well-refined and formed the core of KPMG's business.  English grasped these tools quickly and was successful in being elected as a partner in the firm in 1980. Could business auditing practices be used to further refine Educational Administration to create a better education system?  English discussed the concept and the potential benefits in Improving Curriculum Management in the Schools (1980), and Fundamental Curriculum Decisions (1983). This theory became practice when in 1979 English was asked to conduct a \"Curriculum Audit\" of the Columbus, Ohio Public School District.  This was the first of many formal curriculum audits conducted by English or under his guidelines. The name, \"Curriculum Audit\" was subsequently changed to \"Curriculum Management Audit\" when Virginia Vertiz, Director of the National Curriculum Audit Center from 1990 to 1996, became involved in the improvement of the process. In 1982 English was asked to become Superintendent of Schools for the prestigious Northport-East Northport Union Free School District in Northport, New York on Long Island, New York."

Yet almost none of the professors in U.S. academia had ever practiced education or educational administration in a real secondary school district.  The gap between academia and practical administration was huge (and still is).  Bridging the gap became a quest for English that would take him to many positions at many academic institutions throughout the U.S.  His travels in building this bridge would earn him the nickname \"The Gypsy\" from friends and family. In academia, the yardstick of prestige and success is publications.  From his vantage point as a secondary school District Administrator, English knew that in order to jump to academia, he would have to out-write and out-publish the most prolific and successful Educational Administration professors in the country."

Yamashita is the President and Director of US Shorin-Ryu Karate Association, the USA President of the Zen Okinawan Kobudo Association and Chief Instructor of Shorin Ryu in the United States.

He has studied under Chibana Chosin of Shorin Ryu, Shuguro Nakazato of Shorin Ryu Shorin Kan and Shinpo Matayoshi, founder of the Zen Okinawan Kobudo Renmei. Yamashita combines many progressive fighting tactics with traditional aspects of karatedo. Yamashita's system (known as Suikendo) translates to fist flowing like water. This system of fighting allows the karateka to simultaneously block and strike his opponent. In 2010, Yamashita performed at the United States Martial Arts Festival, hosted by Koyamada International Foundation at the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center in Redondo Beach, California. Yamashita has made many movies over the past 20 years. His first was The Karate in 1973. For several years, he was billed in American films as Bronson Lee."

In 1847, she married the actor Lars Erik Elfforss (1817-1869), director of his own recently formed theater company. Subsequently, she performed under the name Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Elfforss.  She was an actress with the travelling Elfforss Theater Company and from 1886 to 1888 served as its director. She took over the leadership of the theater company during her husband's illness and formally after his death in 1869. As an actress, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Elfforss started in roles as ingenue and heroine but moved on to character roles in modern Nordic and foreign plays of the new realistic movement. According to a critic: \"Her performances was characterized by spirituality, fine details, lively vitality\", and in recognition of her ability, she was given the sobriquet \"The Elise Hwasser of the countryside\", after the renowned actress of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, who was at that time regarded the greatest actress in Sweden. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Elfforss enjoyed great respect during her career, particularly in her capacity as a director: \"Mrs E. was the most noted women theater director in 19th-century Sweden, and the Elfforss company was regarded as the best travelling theater in the nation during the 1870s and 1880s. The repertoire as well as the acting was of the highest level, and the director was widely respected and loved for her excellent personal virtues. As regard to the financial side of the affairs Mrs E. would likely be uncontested among all travelling theater directors. She belong to the very few among them, who were able to leave a small fortune at her passing.\" As director, she focused on Nordic plays, such as Swedish plays by F. A. Dahlgren, C. Axel Anrep,  Emilie Lundberg, but also Lorentz Dietrichson, Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson and Ibsen.  Her greatest financial success was, however, Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne, and she also staged less serious operettas, because \"During the grand days of the Elfforss company in the 1870s and 1880s, the taste for operettas was so great that such an economic and practical director as Mrs E. could scarcely ignore it.\" Her company performed with success at the  Djurg\u00e5rdsteatern  at Djurg\u00e5rden in Stockholm, and toured Finland in 1869, 1870, 1874, 1877 and 1878. In 1888, she transformed the leadership to stage director and theatre manager  August Lindberg (1846\u20131916)  after which the theater company changed its name to the Lindeberg Theater Company. She  continued to perform in the Lindeberg company until 1893.  Between 1890 and 1893, the Lindeberg company staffed the Stora Teatern in Gothenburg.   When the Lindeberg company was dissolved in 1893, she retired with her son Julius Erik Engelbrekt Elfforss  (1847- 1925) to Stockholm  where she died in 1905."

        "content": "Cardinal Borgia belonged to a well known family of Velletri, where he was born, and was a distant relative of the House of Borgia.  His early education was controlled by his uncle Alessandro (1682\u20131764), Archbishop of Fermo. From his youth, Stefano Borgia manifested an aptitude for historical research and a taste for relics of ancient civilizations, a line in which he succeeded so well that, at the age of nineteen, he was received into the Academy of Cortona. He founded a museum in Velletri, in which, during his whole life, he gathered coins and manuscripts, especially Coptic, and which may be considered as his major undertaking and achievement. Such was his passion for antiquities that he is known to have sold his jewels and precious earthenware in order to secure the coveted treasures and have the description of them printed. Borgia placed his scientific collection at the disposal of scholars, regardless of creed and country, and giving them encouragement and support. Paolino da San Bartolomeo, Adler, Zo\u00ebga, Heeren, and many others were among his enthusiastic friends. Borgia was not left entirely to his chosen field of activity, and was called to fill several important political positions. \"He was admitted on all hands to be facile Princeps of the Sacred College.\" Benedict XIV appointed him Governor of Benevento. In 1770 he was made secretary of the Congregation de Propaganda Fide, an office of which he took advantage to acquire antiquities by the help of the missionaries\u2014a help which proved always forthcoming. He was made a cardinal in 1789. In the period of the French invasion Borgia was given charge of Rome by Pius VI (1797\u201398). After the proclamation of the Republic, he was arrested (1798), but quickly released, whereupon he immediately resumed his studies and work of collecting; soon afterwards he joined Pius VI in Valence, Dr\u00f4me, and endeavoured to have this pontiff send to Asia and Africa a body of missionaries who would preach the Gospel and gather various monuments. Cardinal Borgia was a participant in the Papal conclave, 1800, which elected Pope Pius VII. Borgia helped him in the reorganization of the Papal States. In 1801 he was made Rector of the Collegium Romanum, and he was in the retinue of Pius VII when this pontiff went to France to crown the new emperor Napoleon. Having arrived in Lyons, Cardinal Borgia was taken ill and died. After his death his collection of Coptic manuscripts was divided: the non-Biblical manuscripts were taken to Naples and placed in the Biblioteca Borbonica, now the Biblioteca nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III; and the Biblical manuscripts, except for a few which were taken to Naples by mistake, given to the Congregation de Propaganda Fide, together with the collection of coins and monuments forming the Museo Borgiano. At the half of the 19th century the manuscripts of the Museo Borgiano were transferred to the Vatican Library, where they are found today. Before the partition of the manuscripts was made the scholar and convert, Georg Zo\u00ebga, wrote a complete and accurate description of them in his posthumous work Catologus Codicum Copticorum manuscriptorum qui in Museo Borgiano Velitris adservantur (Rome, 1810). Borgia also published several works bearing especially on historical topics. The museum of Stefano Borgia in Velletri was also famous for the Charta Borgea where begins Papyrology in the west and the Codex Borgia, discovered by Alexander von Humboldt, is named after him."

        "content": "Bourne began his career with non-league club Burton Albion before signing with Derby County in February 1971. He saw limited time with the first team, playing mostly with the reserves until January 1974. He finished the 1973\u20131974 season with nine goals as Derby County finished third in the standings. He found himself back with the reserves the next season, with occasional stretches of first team. In 1975, he was part of the team that won the First Division, contributing 17 appearances and 2 goals. In 1976, Derby County loaned Bourne to the Dallas Tornado of the North American Soccer League (NASL). When it became apparent that Bourne would never be more than a sporadic player with the club, Derby County sold his contract to Crystal Palace F.C. for \u00a330,000 in March 1977. At the time that Bourne joined Crystal Palace the team was in a free fall. They had slipped from the top division to the third in two seasons and appeared in danger of falling further. Crystal Palace had just sold Paul Hammond to the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the NASL. They then used the cash to purchase Bourne. Bourne made an immediate impact, scoring nine goals in fifteen games and helping Crystal Palace return to the Second Division. Despite his contribution, Bourne was considered a poor long-term investment and he was sent to the Dallas Tornado in the spring of 1978."

He scored fifteen goals in twenty-two games earning second-team All Star honors. In 1978, Dallas purchased his contract from Crystal Palace. In 1979, the Tornado traded Bourne to the Atlanta Chiefs for the first round in the 1979 College Draft. Bourne scored eighteen goals in twenty-nine games for the Chiefs in 1979, but his production dropped to five goals in twenty games in 1980. As a result, the Chiefs sent Bourne to the Seattle Sounders where he finished the season with two goals in eight games. That winter, Bourne was one of the top players during the NASL indoor season, scoring twenty-one goals in seventeen games. Bourne played the 1981 season, his last in the NASL, with Seattle. In the fall of 1981, he signed with the Wichita Wings of the Major Indoor Soccer League. In the 1981\u20131982 season, he twenty goals. In 1982, he signed on loan from the Wings to the Oklahoma City Slickers of the American Soccer League. The Slickers went to the championship series where it fell to the Detroit Express. Bourne then returned to the Wings for the 1982-1983 indoor season. The Slickers attempted to acquire him for the 1983 ASL season, but the Wings asking price was too high and Bourne signed with the Dallas Americans. He led the league in scoring with seventeen goals. He returned to the Wings and was the league's second-leading scorer when he suffered a season-ending injury in April 1984. There are also indications that he may have played in the United Soccer League in 1984."

        "content": "Svetlana Sleptsova was born in a sports family. At the age of ten, she started regular biathlon classes, when biathlon coach Alexander Korchak came to her school and invited her to engage in biathlon. In a chat of 17 January 2008 at Rasen-Antholz, Sleptsova recalls: \"I started doing biathlon in third grade. There was nothing else but biathlon in Khanty-Mansiysk at that time. There was no alternative.\" Initially, the young athletes were shooting with air rifles, and the biathlon exercises were combined with ballet dancing, boxing, and karate. Sleptsova achieved her first success in 2001, when she won the A. Strepetova prize at the Russian Youth Championships. In 2005, under the direction of Mikhail Novikov, she won the individual competition at the Youth World Championships in Kontiolahti (Finland), 1:15 minutes ahead of Vita Semerenko. A few months later, she suffered a severe loss\u2014the death of her father. Growing into the juniors' age group, Sleptsova became a member of the Yugra team of head coach Valery Zakharov. After two years, thanks to hard training under the sensitive guidance of an experienced coach, she advanced to one of the world's best junior athletes, and did her World Cup debut at Pokljuka in 2007. According to Sleptsova, this experience helped her to be better prepared for the Junior World Championships, and so she achieved two victories at Martell\u2014in the sprint and pursuit competitions, respectively. The successful season for this young athlete was completed by the Senior Russian Championships, where she won three medals, and received a ticket to the country's main national team. Sleptsova coped surprisingly quickly with senior biathlon, attaining several top-10 ranks before the start of the new year. Next, she finished the sprint at Oberhof, Germany as second, and repeated this result in the subsequent week at Ruhpolding. Later, after the disqualification of Kaisa Varis (Finland), she was awarded the victory of this competition. Sleptsova arrived at the 2008 World Championships in \u00d6stersund in good form, but an illness prevented her from demonstrating her maximum capability. However, she won the bronze medal in the mixed relay competition. At the end of the season, at Oslo-Holmenkollen, she achieved her first \"real\" victory, finally standing on top of the pedestal, and won the pursuit competition as well. She came up with similar results at the 2008 Russian Championships, winning three gold medals and the grand prize\u2014a car. As of 2009, she has three world cup victories, excluding the one Varis retrieved after being cleared to compete again after IBU had broken test correction process. Sleptsova's last competition was the 2017 Summer Biathlon World Championships in Chaykovskiy, Russia. There, she won on all three disciplines (sprint, pursuit and mixed). Following that, Sleptsova announced her retirement on 27 August 2017, to instead focus on family life."

        "content": "He worked as a professor of physics at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1898 to 1907. He spent a one-year sabbatical with Pierre and Marie Curie in their radium research laboratory at the University of Paris in 1906 and was then invited to work with them from 1907 to 1912. He published 17 scientific papers during this time mostly around the properties of X-rays from radioactive sources and the measurement of heat generated from radioactive disintegration.  Although none of the papers were in direct collaboration with the Curies, he worked closely with them and it was reported that when Marie Curie visited America years later, she stated that she most wanted to see \"Niagara Falls, The Grand Canyon and William Duane\" Duane refined a technique for extracting radon-222 gas from radium sulfate solutions. Solutions containing 1 gram of radium were \"milked\" to create radon \"seeds\" of about 20 millicuries each.  These \"seeds\" were distributed throughout Paris for use in endocurietherapy. Duane perfected this \"milking\" technique during his time in Paris and referred to the device as a \"radium cow\". He returned to the United States in 1913 and worked in a joint role as assistant professor of physics at Harvard and Research Fellow in Physics of the Harvard Cancer Commission. The Cancer Commission was founded in 1901 and hired Duane to investigate the usage of radium emanations in the treatment of cancer. In 1915 he built Boston's first \"radium cow\" and thousands of patients were treated with the radon-222 generated from it. He published eight papers on the technical details of using radioactive material and X-Rays in the treatment of cancer. In 1917, Harvard created the chair of bio-physics for him. Duane made important contributions to the technical details of measuring X-ray dosage in terms of the ionization of air. He conducted research to determine the structure of matter and on the mechanism of radiation. He developed the Duane-Hunt law, relating the minimum wavelength of X-rays to the threshold voltage of the cathode rays  that excite them; and Duane's hypothesis of quantized translative momentum transfer. In 1925, Arthur Compton demonstrated that the scattering of 130,000-volt X-rays from the first sixteen elements in the periodic table (hydrogen through sulfur) were polarized. Duane spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong. Duane carried out a series of experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found evidence that Compton was correct. In 1924, Duane conceded that this was the case. He served as Councillor of the Societe de Physique from 1920 to 1923, as Chairman of the Division of Physical Sciences of the National Research Council from 1922 to 1923, as President of the Society for Cancer Research in 1923 and as Vice President of section B of the American Association for the Advancement of Science from 1927 to 1928. After his retirement from Harvard in 1934, he was awarded the title professor of Biophysics Emeritus."

A photo of her by Durward Garyhill was voted \"Most Provocative Still of 1947\" by the International Society of Photographic Arts in January 1948. She had captured almost as much attention three years earlier in 1944 when, at age 19, she married the long-time head of her studio's fabled art department, Cedric Gibbons, then 54. The wedding occurred on October 25, 1944. Although the age difference inspired a certain amount of winking in the gossip columns at the time, the marriage proved a strong one and lasted until Gibbons' death in 1960. Brooks subsequently married Dr. Rex Ross (1908-1999), a surgeon and founder of the Non-invasive Vascular Clinic at Hollywood Hospital. According to long-time friend Maria Cooper Janis, Gary Cooper's daughter, Ross in the years after her retirement from films became a skilled still photographer. She also worked actively for a number of children's charities.

Scott was born in Suva, Fiji, and educated in Fiji and New Zealand. He held a number of prominent public positions for various national, regional and international councils and programmes. He was a fourth generation European Fijian and his father, Sir Maurice Scott was the first European Speaker in the Parliament of Fiji. Scott joined the Red Cross in 1994 and played a key mediation role after George Speight seized parliament on 19 May 2000 and took Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and his government hostage for 56 days. Scott was initially the only outsider allowed to see the hostages and eventually oversaw their release. He declined to testify in Speight's trial because he did not want to compromise the neutrality of the Red Cross. Scott was involved in trying to restore Fiji's overthrown 1997 constitution and was among the members of the gay community that put forward submissions to keep the constitution because it protected LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) rights. John Scott was murdered on 1 July 2001 in Suva along with his partner, Gregory Scrivener, in an apparent homophobic attack with a possible political motive.

        "content": "Charles Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Morren (3 March 1807 Ghent \u2013 17 December 1858 Li\u00e8ge), was a Belgian botanist and horticulturist, and Director of the Jardin botanique de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge. Morren taught physics at Ghent University between 1831 and 1835. At the same time he studied medicine and graduated in 1835. He became Professor extraordinarius of botany at the University of Li\u00e8ge from 1835 to 1837, and full professor from 1837 to 1854. Morren discovered that the vanilla flower is pollinated by the social and stingless Melipone bee, which occurs only in Mexico, obviating natural pollination in other countries. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s brought vanilla to Europe, but for more than 300\u00a0years the pollination mechanism remained a mystery. Morren was the first to discover a method for artificial pollination, which made it possible to cultivate vanilla in the French colonies. Pollination of vanilla pods is required to make the plants produce the fruit from which the vanilla spice is obtained. In 1837, Charles Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Morren discovered this fact and pioneered a method of artificially pollinating the plant. The method proved financially unworkable and was not deployed commercially. In 1841, Edmond Albius, a 12-year-old slave who lived on the French island of R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean, discovered that the plant could be hand-pollinated. Hand-pollination allowed global cultivation of the plant. Noted\u00a0French\u00a0botanist\u00a0and plant collector Jean Michel Claude Richard falsely claimed to have discovered the technique three or four years earlier, but by the end of the 20th century, Albius was considered the true discoverer. He was the father of Charles Jacques \u00c9douard Morren. Morren and his son produced the journal La Belgique Horticole (35 volumes, 1851\u20131885). Morren also coined the term phenology, which refers to the scientific discipline that studies the seasonal cycles of animals and plants.  Morren first used the term phenology in 1849 during a public lecture at the Academy of Brussels.  The first use of the term phenology in a scientific paper dates back to 1853 when Morren published \u201cSouvenirs ph\u00e9nologiques de l\u2019hiver 1852-1853\u201d (\u201cPhenological memories of the winter 1852-1853\u201d).  This paper describes an exceptionally warm winter when plants exhibited unusually phenological patterns. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation C.Morren when citing a botanical name."

He participated in radio recordings broadcast on the Third Programme in the 1950s. In his obituary, Alan Blyth described Legay's voice as \"light yet penetrating timbre, its flexible, liquid character\" and that he used it \"with fastidious taste\" and displayed \"keenness of word-painting allied to the inflections of the music\". Along with such mid-twentieth century tenors as Alain Vanzo and L\u00e9opold Simoneau, Legay represented a lost style of French operatic singing."

On 22 September two German soldiers were killed and two others wounded when some boxes of abandoned munitions they were inspecting exploded. The Germans insisted it was sabotage, and the next day they rounded up 22 civilians to try to get them to name the saboteurs. The soldiers made the prisoners dig their own graves when they continued to protest their innocence. D'Acquisto, in charge of the local Carabinieri post, was taken to the prisoners. When it became clear that the Germans intended to kill them, D'Acquisto \"confessed\" to being solely responsible. He was executed by firing squad, but the civilians were released unharmed. D'Acquisto was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor and is being considered for beatification."

He left school at the age of 14, as was customary for working-class boys at the time. He volunteered to join the Carabinieri in 1939 and left for Libya the next year, a few months before the start of the Second World War. After being wounded in the leg, he remained with his division until he contracted malaria. He returned to Italy in 1942 to attend officer school. He graduated as a vice-sergeant and was assigned to an outpost in Torre in Pietra, a little rural center on the Via Aurelia not far from Rome. On 25 July 1943, Benito Mussolini was overthrown, and the new Italian government negotiated secretly with the Allies to switch sides. An armistice was officially announced on 8 September."

        "content": "After the 9\u201311 September fighting in Rome, elements of the German 2nd Parachute Division were detached to coastal defense duties, and a small unit was camped near an old military installation previously used by the Guardia di Finanza, in the vicinity of Palidoro, frazione of Fiumicino, which was in the territorial jurisdiction of the station of Torre in Pietra, another frazione of the same municipality. Here, on 22 September, German soldiers were inspecting boxes of abandoned munitions when there was an explosion. Two died and two others were wounded. The commander of the German detachment blamed the death on \"unnamed locals\" and demanded the cooperation of the local Carabinieri post, at the moment under D'Acquisto's temporary command. The next morning, D'Acquisto, having gathered some information, tried in vain to explain that the death was an accident, but the Germans insisted on their version of events and demanded reprisals, according to a standing order issued by Feldmarschall Kesselring a few days before. On 23 September, the Germans conducted searches and arrested 22 local residents. An armed squad took D'Acquisto by force from the station to the Torre di Palidoro, an ancient watchtower, where the prisoners were gathered. Under interrogation, all of the civilians said that they were innocent. When the Germans again demanded the names of the responsible persons, D'Acquisto replied that there were none \u2013 the explosion was accidental. The Germans ridiculed, insulted, and beat him, and tore his uniform. Suddenly, the prisoners were handed shovels and forced to dig a mass grave for their own burial after execution. The digging went on for some time; when it was completed, it was obvious the Germans meant to carry out their threat. D'Acquisto then \"confessed\" to the alleged crime, declared that he alone was responsible for the \"murder\" and that the civilians were innocent, and demanded that they be released right away. One of those freed, 17- or 18-year-old Angelo Amadio, witnessed the execution by firing squad. D'Acquisto was 22. His remains are preserved at the Church of St. Clara in Naples, in the first chapel on the left, near the entrance."

        "content": "Ellen Buckingham Mathews (1853\u20131920) was a popular female English novelist during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She was also known as Mrs Reeves after her marriage in 1877 to Dr. Henry Albert Reeves (1841\u20131914) but was best known under her pen name, Helen Mathers. She was born in Misterton, Somerset. Her first novel, \"Comin' thro' the Rye\" was published in 1875. It was partly based on people in her life and on her own early romantic experiences. She also acknowledged Rhoda Broughton as an early influence. She continued to write until her death. She was educated at a boarding school in  Chantry near Frome in Somerset. In her first novel, \"Comin' thro' the Rye\" she describes some of her experiences at school. \"Mr Russell\" in the novel was the Rev. Mr. Fussell in real life, who was the Lord of the manor and founder of the school. In the novel she calls the village Charteris. From 1875 to 1895 the novel sold over 35,000 copies. Due to a confusion of titles, some sources attribute a number of books by Scottish novelist Anne S. Swan to Mathers. Mathers published a short novel entitled \"Land o' the Leal, by the Author of Comin' Thro' the Rye\" in 1878. Swan published \"The Land o' the Leal\" (same title except with the addition of \"The,\" completely different book) using her male pseudonym David Lyall, in 1896. Conflating the two different novels with the same title has led some people to assume (erroneously) that David Lyall is Mathers's pseudonym. It is not."

        "content": "Karl Z\u00e9ro is the youngest son of Gui Tellenne, a civil servant and poet, and Annick Tellenne, an author and talk-show host. He has three brothers: \u00c9ric, a writer under the name of Raoul Rabut, Bruno (aka Basile de Koch) and Olivier, a business executive. In the late 1970s \u00c9ric, Bruno and Marc founded the satirical comedy troupe Groupe d'Intervention culturelle Jalons. 1979 Z\u00e9ro met his later wife and mother of their three children Anne-Laure Chaptel (today's stage name: Daisy d'Errata) in the lyceum both were attending. Anne-Laure as well as Bruno\u2019s wife Virginie (Frigide Barjot) later on became members of the Jalons. Z\u00e9ro's first publication was a comic entitled The Adventures of Edmond in the magazine Jalons in the early 1980s. Subsequently, he started to work for the publications M\u00e9tal Hurlant, Charlie Hebdo, Zoulou, and L'\u00c9cho des savanes, first as an artist and then as a story writer. At the same time, in 1981, he started working for the trendy magazine Actuel as a journalist specialising in interviewing stars. He also joined the just formed team of Radio Nova, working alongside his future wife, Daisy d\u2019Errata. He then joined Globe and Lui, where his talents as an interviewer attracted notice. For a few months he hosted a comedy radio show on RFM with Antoine de Caunes and Albert Algoud called Babebibou. In 1986, Karl Z\u00e9ro was hired by Europe 1 to host their show G\u00e9ant Gratuit (Free Giant) with Doug Headline (son of Jean-Patrick Manchette). They would be let go after four months. Z\u00e9ro then returned to TF1 while Doug devoted himself to film. At TF1, Z\u00e9ro's show Pirates with Jean-Yves Lafesse lasted for only one episode in September 1987. Again, his sense of humour was considered 'inappropriate' and he was let go. Alain de Greef of Canal+ (a French pay for view TV channel) then offered him the direction of Nulle part ailleurs (Nowhere else) with his old collaborator Antoine de Caunes. He made use of video gags to bring political personalities into his sketches, which often focussed on current events. In 1993 he successfully proposed adding a television news report parody called \"Zerorama\", \"telling events of moral rearmament\", in which he used a mode of presentation and tone inspired by newsreels of the Vichy regime under Philippe P\u00e9tain in order to satirise \u00c9douard Balladur's government and the media supporting it. Also in 1993, he directed an offbeat film called Le Tronc, in which he appeared alongside Albert Algoud, Jos\u00e9 Garcia and Lova Moor. From September 1996 to June 2006, he was the presenter of Le Vrai Journal on Canal +, a television news show with the intention of 'saying out loud' what other French news shows 'kept hidden'. Karl Z\u00e9ro is not a journalist and does not have press credentials. In the show, he mixed classic news reports, usually filmed by the CAPA Agency, and sketches using video gags, in which his wife Daisy d'Errata frequently played a part. When talking with politicians, he attempted to make them accept the informal mode of address. Over 10 seasons, his audience remained steady at a 10% market share, i.e., 1.5\u00a0million viewers a week. He became the reference point for politicians who wanted to reach young people. Between 2000 and 2002, he published a printed offshoot of the show, le Vrai Papier Journal. Also from September 2001 to June 2002, at the suggestion of Eric Guillaumond, he co-produced with Michel Malaussena Le journal des bonnes nouvelles, also on Canal +. In March 2003 this was renamed Le contre-journal. He also produced 60 jours 60 nuits, which told the story of the intersecting lives of Joeystarr and Francis Lalanne. In 2004, Z\u00e9ro also hosted C\u2019est quoi ce jeu? on Canal +. In 1996, when Le Vrai journal was beginning, Karl Z\u00e9ro agreed to John Paul Lepers' request that he meet with Pierre Carles, who had been censured a year earlier by Canal + for his film criticising TV journalism, Pas vu \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9. Carles proposed filming an expos\u00e9 of Canal + censorship, which Z\u00e9ro was naturally unable to do on that same network. Carles' second proposal, on Jacques Chirac's practice of choosing the journalists who would interview him, notably Michel Field, who at the time also worked for Canal +, was also rejected, this time by Alain de Greef, who was head of programming. In 1998 Carles produced a film titled Pas vu pas pris in which he juxtaposed statements by Karl Z\u00e9ro on his desire to say and show anything on his show with telephone conversations between the two in which he alluded to oversight by his bosses. Z\u00e9ro, for his part, deplored Carles' wasting his time \"beating down open doors\", saying that \"When one works for a television network, they're the ones who have the final cut\". A Catholic, Karl Z\u00e9ro nonetheless does not hide his sympathy for alter-mundialist positions.  His shows are produced by his own production company, La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du spectacle, which is currently 50% owned by Endemol, which specialises in reality television. In June 2003, with network consent and without naming them, he read aloud on the air the accusations of the serial killer Patrice Al\u00e8gre (in the form of a letter which he had received from him) and of two former prostitutes that certain prominent people in Toulouse were involved in a sado-masochistic group which had covered up sexual assault, torture and murder. One of the accused was later found innocent. It also appeared that Z\u00e9ro had paid one of the ex-prostitutes \u20ac15,000 as an advance on a book. The possible violation of journalistic ethics, frequent mentions of Z\u00e9ro and Canal + in publicity about the accusations, and resulting political pressure contributed to the termination of his contract for Le Vrai Journal in June 2006. After three years of investigation, in March 2007 Judge Nathalie Turquey excused Karl Z\u00e9ro from the necessity of appearing in the case, subject to future appeals. Karl Z\u00e9ro's blog, video, and forum site Web 2 Z\u00e9ro has hosted many videos by his fans, the 'z\u00e9ronautes', and interviews especially with September 11 Truth advocates, a position in which he is interested. Also online, in 2006\u201307 he hosted on AOL Le Club du Net, a weekly round-up of interviews concerning the French presidential election campaign produced by Power Podcast, and in mid-March 2007 JT2Zero, a daily video on demand online newscast about the campaign produced by Havas Media. Z\u00e9ro supported the candidacy of Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, and in his official campaign clips, Z\u00e9ro was the interviewer. Since September 2007, Karl Z\u00e9ro has hosted a segment called \"Les Faits Karl Z\u00e9ro\" on 13e Rue, a show on unsolved crimes produced by Troisi\u00e8me \u0152il, and beginning in spring 2010 was to host 90-minute spin-off shows in prime time. In January 2008, he accepted a position as head of the media division of the Belgian holding group Rentabiliweb. Since September 2008, Karl Z\u00e9ro has had a daily prime-time show on BFM TV. Initially an interview show called Karl Z\u00e9ro sur BFM TV and inspired by CNN's Larry King Live, following the 2008 release of his film Starko! la saison 1 on Nicolas Sarkozy's first year as President of France, on 7 September 2009 this became Sarko Info, a parody of television news shows in which he conducts an interview following a commentary on the news by Michel Guidoni playing the part of Sarkozy as he already did in the movie."

On his 1922 American naturalization documents, Esmelton's birth name was listed as Frederick Batty Green Bryant, and when he established residence in the United States, he sometimes used the name Frederick Esmelton Bryant. Sometime in the mid-1920s, he legally changed his name to Frederick Bryant Esmelton. While best known as a silent film actor, he also performed in numerous stage plays, especially on the west coast. For example, beginning in 1903, he led a troupe in Portland, Oregon, where he portrayed a number of roles for several years. But Esmelton was not just a stage actor: he was a frequent director of stage plays. In fact, when he worked for the Bijou Stock Company, one New Haven, Connecticut theater critic said he was \"one of the ablest stage directors ever known in the field of stock work.\" And Esmelton also served as the manager of an acting troupe based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Among the up-and-coming film stars who got their start working for him in Pittsburgh was Richard Dix. Esmelton frequently returned to his native Australia to perform in stage plays, some of which he produced.  And during the first World War, he was in a theater company sponsored by the Knights of Columbus that volunteered to go and entertain the troops in France.  While he was seldom cast in a starring role during his silent film career, he became known as a versatile supporting actor, for which he was often praised by critics. Esmelton was married several times. One of his wives was silent film actress Jewel Power (real name: Louise Power), with whom he had acted when both were in the Baker Stock Company in Portland, Oregon. After they divorced, he married Shakespearean actress Mary Hall, whose career he had managed while they worked in Pittsburgh. In addition to his acting career, in 1925, Esmelton was among the eight actors who founded the Masquers, a club where actors and directors could gather and fraternize. It remained in operation for more than six decades.  He helped to arrange its early events and was the club's first manager.  In his later years, in semi-retirement, Esmelton owned and operated a successful catering business in Hollywood, whose clients included some of the film studios where he had worked. He died in Los Angeles in October 1933, at the age of 61."

Despite being a sympathizer of Get\u00falio Vargas, Paul was a part of the Jewish underground resistance. Anna eventually suffered from a major paralysis due to a trauma caused by the fact that Jorge's sister, Susana, was not able to embark to Brazil with them, and so until he was 7 years old a nanny, L\u00facia, took care of him; L\u00facia was a m\u00e3e-de-santo, and introduced Jorge to Candombl\u00e9. In 1948 Jorge's parents divorced, and Anna eventually remarried Henri M\u00fcller, a violinist who played for the S\u00e3o Paulo State Symphony, and who taught Jorge how to play the violin. His family later moved to S\u00e3o Paulo, where he studied at the prestigious Col\u00e9gio Dante Alighieri; despite being an excellent student, he would, however, be expelled before he could graduate from high school because of a text he wrote, considered \"indecent\" by his teachers. Mautner began to write his first book, Deus da Chuva e da Morte, when he was 15 years old; it was published in 1962, and in the following year it won the Pr\u00eamio Jabuti. Deus da Chuva e da Morte would be the first part of what is today known as his Mitologia do Kaos trilogy, which also comprises Kaos (1963) and Narciso em Tarde Cinza (1965). In it, Mautner would define the main ideology of what he calls the \"Kaos Movement\". In 1962 he joined the Brazilian Communist Party, after being invited by M\u00e1rio Schenberg. Mautner was arrested during the 1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat, but was later released, under the conditions of \"expressing himself more carefully\". In 1966 he recorded his first musical release, the 7\" single \"Radioatividade\", through RCA Records. Soon after he travelled to the United States, where he worked for the UNESCO and as a translator of Brazilian books. He later met poet Robert Lowell, serving as his secretary, as well as Paul Goodman, with whom he developed a strong friendship and suffered an everlasting influence from him. In 1968 he briefly returned to Brazil, where he worked as screenwriter on Neville d'Almeida's film Jardim de Guerra, that was only released two years later. In 1970 he travelled to London, where he befriended Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. He later returned to Brazil, settling in Rio de Janeiro once more, where he began to write for the humoristic newspaper O Pasquim. In the same year he directed the film O Demiurgo, which starred himself, Gil, Veloso, Jos\u00e9 Roberto Aguilar, P\u00e9ricles Cavalcanti and Leilah Assun\u00e7\u00e3o. The film was censored by the dictatorship though, and never received a wide release. (In 2013 Mautner made the film available in its entirety through his official YouTube channel.) Around the same time he met N\u00e9lson Jacobina, one of his most prolific songwriting partners, with whom he wrote, among many other songs, the 1974 hit \"Maracatu At\u00f4mico\". On December 10, 1973, Mautner was invited to partake in the Banquete dos Mendigos \"show-manifesto\", idealized and directed by Jards Macal\u00e9. The show, that happened at the Museum of Modern Art of Rio de Janeiro and was backed by the UN, celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and also counted with the presence of Chico Buarque, Dominguinhos, Edu Lobo, Gal Costa, Gonzaguinha, Johnny Alf, Luiz Melodia, Milton Nascimento, MPB4, N\u00e9lson Jacobina, Paulinho da Viola and Raul Seixas, among others. It spawned a double-disc live album, which due to censorship issues was only released in 1979. In 1988 Mautner took part in a short-lived \"joke side project\" formed by then-Tit\u00e3s member Arnaldo Antunes named Vestidos de Espa\u00e7o, which also comprised Branco Mello, Charles Gavin, Paula Toller of Kid Abelha and record producer Liminha. The band's only release before their demise in the following year was a 7\" single with the tracks \"Pipi Pop\u00f4\" and \"A Marcha do Demo\"; the latter was included in the Tit\u00e3s compilation album E-collection from 2000.<ref>books.google.com.br/ \"BRock\" \u2013 By Arthur Dapieve</ref> In 2002 Mautner served as a guest musician on synth-pop band Metr\u00f4's third album, D\u00e9j\u00e0-Vu, providing violin and additional vocals for a track. In the same year he released a collaborative album with Caetano Veloso, Eu N\u00e3o Pe\u00e7o Desculpa, which won the Latin Grammy Award in 2003. A documentary about Mautner, directed by Pedro Bial and Heitor d'Alincourt, was released in 2012 to positive reception, entitled Jorge Mautner: O Filho do Holocausto; it was inspired by his autobiography of the same name, published in 2006. In the same year he collaborated with Rog\u00e9rio Skylab in his album Abismo e Carnaval, writing the lyrics and providing additional vocals for the track \"Palmeira Brasileira\". On January 17, 2016, coinciding with his 75th birthday, Mautner published his eleventh book, Kaos Total. On July 28, 2016, it was reported that Mautner suffered a heart attack and was rushed to the Hospital Samaritano in Rio. He underwent a surgery to implant four stents into his heart, but eventually recovered. One month later, on August 30, he announced that he began work on a 10-volume series of books about his years as a militant for the Brazilian Communist Party during the mid-1960s. In 2017 Mautner appeared in La\u00eds Bodanzky's film Just Like Our Parents as Homero Fabri. In April 2019 he released his first studio album in 12 years, entitled N\u00e3o H\u00e1 Abismo em que o Brasil Caiba. One of the album's tracks is a tribute to feminist/LGBT activist Marielle Franco, murdered in 2018. The album was considered one of the 25 best Brazilian albums of the first half of 2019 by the S\u00e3o Paulo Association of Art Critics."

Jessel appeared both in the West End and on Broadway in the 1950s in Agatha Christie's play Witness for the Prosecution, for which she won a Tony Award in 1955. As Romaine Heilger aka Romaine Vole, Jessel's performance in the dock was praised as \"cold-blooded\" and that she \"makes a clear-cut image of hatred releasing itself suddenly from inhibitions which have become intolerable\". Other stage roles included Lady Macbeth at the Old Vic in 1962 and Lady Bracknell in The Importance of Being Earnest in the opening season of the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford."

Initially she partnered with her 16-year-old younger brother Matthias Andreas Stein (1776-1842) under the business name Geschwister Stein.  After 1802, she and her brother parted company, and she continued building pianos under her name (Nannette Streicher n\u00e9e Stein). With the support of her husband and from 1824 to 1825 with their son, Johann Baptist (1796\u20131871) as a partner, the business became an important piano manufacturer.  They produced 50 to 65 grand pianos each year. Johann Baptist Streicher was the sole owner of the factory, which under his leadership acquired many patents and became world famous. The company was sold in 1896 to the brothers Stingl. Two fine instruments by Streicher are in the collection of Scenkonstmuseet (earlier known as Musikmuseet) in Stockholm, Sweden. They are numbered M266 & F332."

Born in Geneva, Switzerland, he holds triple nationality from all three countries. He is a former Formula Three Euroseries champion and he almost claimed the DTM title with Audi in 2016. In 2021, he finished as the Vice Champion in the FIA Formula E World Companionship. He is a street circuit specialist and renowned as \"Mr Macau\". Currently, he is racing in the Formula E championship for the Venturi Team. He is renowned as \"Mr Macau\" as he has amassed ten wins (with seven overall victories) in Macau from 2008 to 2017 in F3 and GT races. These wins include 2008 F3 Qualification Race, 2009 F3 Main Race, 2010 F3 Qualification Race and Main Race, 2011, 2012, 2013 Macau GT Races, 2013 Audi R8 LMS Race and 2017 Macau GT World Cup Qualification Race and Main Race. This is a record for any driver or rider in Macau up to date. In 2017\u20132018, he drove for the Venturi Formula E Team. In the first weekend of his Formula E races in Hong Kong, his performances stood out as a rookie as he finished 7th after charging from the field in the first race. And in the second race, he led most of the race until a spin which costed him the victory. However, he still finished in 2nd place and claimed the best-ever result for the Venturi team in FE season 4. In 2018\u20132019 season, he claimed a podium finish in Mexico and his first ever FE victory in Hong Kong on 10 March 2019. After his win, a string of bad luck and poor reliability had put Edo out of the championship contention. Despite these problems, he still finished season 5 as the highest-placed Venturi powertrain driver with 52 points (Massa 36 points, Vandoorne 35 points and Paffett 9 points). In 2019\u20132020 season, he performed consistently and finished in the points in 7 out of 11 races. His best result was a 4th place in Diriyah.

In 2008, he finished second in the F3 Euroseries championship, ahead of third place Jules Bianchi. He also won the Macau Grand Prix qualifying race and finished a close second place in the main race that year. At the end of the 2009 season, Mortara returned to Formula Three to contest the Macau Grand Prix with Signature, after driven some uncompetitive GP2 machines early in the season. He went on to win the event easily ahead of team-mate Jean Karl Vernay. In 2010, he contested 2010 campaign in the Formula Three Euroseries. He won the championship and then signed for Audi to drive for their DTM cars from 2011. In November 2010, he won the Macau F3 Grand Prix for the second time in a row. He became the first-ever driver to have won this famous event 2 times. For 2011, Mortara made a switch to the DTM series driving for Audi Team Rosberg. He made his progress steadily season by season. In 2016, he lost the DTM title by just 4 points. If it was not the wrong penalty given to him in the Hungarian round (which cost him valuable points in the championship), then he should/would be able to win the title.

After doing the practice start procedure, his car lost brake pressure, causing him to go straight into the barriers at turn 18. Mercedes, who supplied the Mercedes-Benz EQ powertrains to the team, were forced to sit out qualifying along with Mortara's own ROKiT Venturi Racing car. They later stated that an incorrect software parameter meant the rear brake system didn't activate as intended and the fail-safe did not kick in. Mortara was released from the hospital but opted not to partake in race 2. In Rome, his car refused to power up in qualifying and he was forced to start at the back of the grid in race one. Things didn't improve for the race and he was an early retirement with damage after hitting a slowing S\u00e9rgio Sette C\u00e2mara as the Dragon / Penske dived for the pitlane. On Sunday, however, he qualified seventh and scored a solid fourth place after battling hard with Maximilian G\u00fcnther's BMW. In the first race of the Valencia ePrix, Mortara was taken out by Lotterer in the rain and then ran out of energy as most cars did in the final stage of the race. On Sunday, he charged through the field to take 9th place and score another 2 points. In the Monaco race, all Mercedes-powered cars were not as competitive as expected. Mortara qualified in the midfield after his qualifying run in group 2. He charged his way up to 9th position until the second last corner only to be hit from behind, and thus narrowly missed out on points. In the first race of the Puebla ePrix, Mortara qualified a strong sixth after coming from group 2. He got past both BMWs in the race and finished on the podium for the second time in the season. On Sunday, he starred in qualifying again to take 3rd on the starting grid. In the race, he held off Wehrlein to earn his second Formula E victory as he moved top of the standings in the drivers' championship. As the championship leader in New York, bad luck stroke Mortara as he was unable to set a full-power qualifying lap after a switch on his steering wheel locked into place, and he had to start at the back of the grid as a result. He managed to get pas 9 car and eventually finished 14th. On Sunday, he was out of points after tangling with Jake Dennis in the race. In London's first race, despite setting the fastest time in qualifying group 1, Mortara could only manage to start from 16th on the grid. He charged his way to finish 9th and claimed 2 points. In the second race, he started in the midfield again but stalled on the grid. He would eventually finish 11th. In the penultimate round of the 2020-21 season in Berlin, Mortara qualified a strong 4th. He was able to get past both DS techeetah in the race and threatened di Grassi's lead all the way until the chequered flag, with di Grassi just edging Mortara by 0.141s at the finish. He thus entered the season finale second in the drivers\u2019 table with just a three-point deficit to Nyck de Vries. However, at the start of the race, a stalled Evans saw Mortara left nowhere to go and he smashed into Evan's car heavily. both title contenders were thus eliminated and Mortara sustained a fractured vertebra as a result of this collision. Nevertheless, he still finished the season as the Vice-Champion in the 2020-21 season with 92 points."

In the second race, he qualified on the front row of the gird for the first time in his career. In the race, he got past the pole sitter Nyck de Vries and scored his third win of his career. His new teammate Di Grassi finished 3rd. This is the first ever double podium for the Venturi Formula E team. In Mexico, Mortara qualified on the front row again. He took the lead from Pascal Wehrlein in the early stage of the race. However, his pace in the Venturi was not able to defend the faster Porsche and DS techeetah cars and thus he finished the race in P5. He continued to lead the Formula E drivers' standings after 3 rounds."

        "content": "In 1993, Ambros and his co-workers Rosalind Lee and Rhonda Feinbaum reported in the journal Cell that they had discovered single-stranded non-protein-coding regulatory RNA molecules in the organism C. elegans. Previous research, including work by Ambros and Horvitz, had revealed that a gene known as lin-4 was important for normal larval development of C. elegans, a nematode often studied as a model organism. Specifically, lin-4 was responsible for the progressive repression of the protein LIN-14 during larval development of the worm; mutant worms deficient in lin-4 function had persistently high levels of LIN-14 and displayed developmental timing defects. However, the mechanism for control of LIN-14 remained unknown. Ambros and colleagues found that lin-4, unexpectedly, did not encode a regulatory protein. Instead, it gave rise to some small RNA molecules, 22 and 61 nucleotides in length, which Ambros called lin-4S (short) and lin-4L (long). Sequence analysis showed that lin-4S was part of lin-4L: lin-4L was predicted to form a stem-loop structure, with lin-4S contained in one of the arms, the 5' arm. Furthermore, Ambros, together with Gary Ruvkun (Harvard), discovered that lin-4S was partially complementary to several sequences in the 3' untranslated region of the messenger RNA encoding the LIN-14 protein. Ambros and colleagues hypothesized that lin-4 could regulate LIN-14 through binding of lin-4S to these sequences in the lin-14 transcript in a type of antisense RNA mechanism. In 2000, another C. elegans small RNA regulatory molecule, let-7, was characterized by the Ruvkun lab  and found to be conserved in many species, including vertebrates. These discoveries confirmed that Ambros had in fact discovered a class of small RNAs with conserved functions. These molecules are now known as microRNA. Ambros was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 2007. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011."

Raised in both Canada and Jamaica, she began her musical career after a successful audition with Virgin Records. She signed a record deal with the Capitol Music Group, under which the Virgin imprint operates. Concurrently, EMI Music Canada signed her to more effectively tap into the Canadian market. She has released two albums in Canada. Her first album Passion (2008) spawned singles \"Bounce With Me,\" \"Lady Killer\" and \"Don't Call Me Baby\". The latter became the No. 1 most played song (by a Canadian) on Canadian radio in 2008 and became her very first number one single on Billboards U.S. Hot Dance Club Play. During this year, she was nominated for two Juno Awards for \"Best New Artist\" and \"Best Pop Album of The Year.\" Her second double disc studio album, Tropic Electric (2011) saw Turner alter her public image and return to her original sound. She released three moderately successful singles \"Rock Paper Scissors,\" \"I Could Stay,\" and \"Love Again.\" which gained her another Juno Award Nomination for \"Best R&B Album.\" Throughout Turner's career, she has been well known for her style and image. She's been ranked on Complex magazine list of \"25 Sexiest International Singers You've Never Heard Of\" and Much Music's \"Sexiest Girls list\" in 2008. She has been featured on multiple major Canadian magazine covers and starred in a national Kit Kat campaign.

Her mother arrived in Canada in 1978 with absolutely nothing. \"Now, she owns an industrial engraving company; she feels like she has accomplished the impossible.\" As a young child, Turner danced in her bedroom to music by jazz musician Oscar Peterson. Turner has always mentioned jazz as an inspiration, especially artists such as Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday and Peggy Lee. In 2000, when Turner was 15, her mother sent her to Jamaica to live and experience Jamaican culture. Turner quickly learned that singing is a big part of everyday life in Jamaica, particularly at the Pentecostal church. Friends convinced her to audition for the youth choir despite her own belief that she could not sing. On the strength of her rendition of Canada's national anthem, Turner was accepted into the choir and began singing gospel songs at the Faith Temple Tabernacle in Bayside, Portmore. Turner says this is the time she realized she loved to sing. She went to Victoria School of the Arts in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada prior to her high school years in Jamaica. Turner attended Wolmer's Girl School in Kingston, Jamaica from 2000 to 2002. She attended Harry Ainlay Composite High School in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada after returning from Jamaica which she then graduated from in 2003."

Turner quickly gained attention from her peers, developing an underground fan base that had a number of industry insiders excited. Turner performed on any and every stage she could, entering and winning several competitions, but it was not until a couple of years later that she was successful. In 2005, Turner won a talent contest in Edmonton organised by local radio station The Bounce (91.7 FM). Winning the contest allowed her to record four studio tracks in Vancouver with songwriting/production team, Hipjoint Productions, the most important to Kreesha's career being \"Bounce With Me\". This was noticed by urban and R&B music manager and Canadian entertainment mogul Chris Smith (Nelly Furtado, Fefe Dobson, Tamia) and led to the start of her mainstream music career."

She is also the daughter of composer Erwin Gutawa. Although she originally studied piano, Gutawa later switched to vocals. She was discovered in 2004 while practising her vocals, then booked to sing a duet with ADA Band. After Heaven of Love (2005), featuring the duet, sold 800,000 copies, Gutawa was approached by Sony Music Indonesia with an offer to record a solo album. The success of that album, the self-titled Gita Gutawa, led to numerous acting and marketing job offers. Since her debut, she has recorded two more albums, the well-received Harmoni Cinta in 2009 and the Islamic-themed Balada Shalawat in 2010. As an actress, she has starred in two Indonesian soap operas, Ajari Aku Cinta and Ajari Lagi Aku Cinta.

        "content": "In 2004 Gutawa was approached by the manager of ADA Band, who had heard her practising at her singing lessons from the band's studio next door. She was asked to sing a duet with the band's lead singer; Gutawa, although at the time only singing as a hobby, accepted. The duet, titled \"Yang Terbaik Bagimu\" (\"The Best for You\"), was included on ADA Band's 2005 album Heaven of Love, which sold 800,000 copies. After singing other duets with different singers, including religious singer Haddad Alwi, Gutawa was asked to record a solo album by Sony Music Indonesia. After a year in production, Gutawa's self-titled debut album was released in February 2007. The album was produced by her father and featured songs written by Glenn Fredly and Melly Goeslaw. Well-received, Gita Gutawa sold 150,000 copies in four months and was eventually certified triple platinum. After the success of the album, Gutawa's previously school-oriented schedule was filled with requests for media appearances and sponsorships. This led to Gutawa's mother stepping in and serving as her manager, in which role she continued until she became pregnant. Other members of Gutawa's family then assisted in managing her, with her mother scheduling Gutawa's media appearances and recording sessions. Gutawa soon began singing in music festivals to gain experience. In 2008, she won the 6th International Nile Children Song Festival in Cairo with Ria Leimena's \"To Be One\", which she had previously sung on her debut album. That same year she attended a song festival in Italy. She later assembled a girl band to support her after several performances had to be cancelled due to an inability to find musicians at short notice. After her return from Italy, Gutawa began production of her second album, Harmoni Cinta (Love's Harmony), in June 2008. She played a larger role in its production than in her debut album, choosing the concepts behind the album as well as the track listing; she eventually wrote five of the album's twelve songs. The album was released in May 2009. selling well. In August of that year, she released her biography, Kota Musik Gita Gutawa (Gita Gutawa's Music Box). Gutawa followed Harmony Cinta in August 2010 with a third album, the Islamic religious album Balada Shalawat (Ballads for Salah). During recording, Gutawa received coaching from an Islamic scholar, or ustad, regarding the correct pronunciation of Arabic lyrics used in some songs. The album was launched during Ramadhan, with profits donated to Indonesia's poor. Gutawa has expressed concern that the public sees her rise to fame as being dependent on her already-famous father; she has stated in an interview with The Jakarta Post that she learned that \"nepotism wouldn't work in the music industry\". As such, Gutawa has attempted to emphasise that her duet with ADA Band and contract with Sony Music was won entirely on her own merits, with the band's manager not knowing that she was Erwin Gutawa's daughter when he approached her. She also cites the \"negative sentiments against [her] sudden popularity\" as pushing her to do her best. In 2011, Gutawa announced that she would be retiring from music to study abroad. As a farewell celebration, her father held the concert \"A Masterpiece of Erwin Gutawa\" in Jakarta. She announced that she planned to take a degree in economics. On 5 April 2012, during a visit to Indonesia from her university in England, she performed Chrisye's song \"Baju Pengantin\" (\"Wedding Dress\") in the Kidung Abadi Chrisye concert at Plenary Hall, Jakarta Convention Center. She and her father also wrote a new song for the concert, entitled \"Kidung Abadi\" (\"Eternal Ballad\"), which was made by stringing together 246 syllables in Chrisye's voice."

In 2009, Gutawa voiced a character in Meraih Mimpi (Chasing Dreams), the Indonesian adaptation of Sing to the Dawn; the voice recording took four months. She later cited it as a good learning experience. The following year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, Love in Perth, in which she played a shy student studying in Perth, Australia.

Henschel became known for making pictorial representations of Rio de Janeiro as a landscaper photographer and for being an excellent portraitist. He earned the title of Photographo da Casa Imperial (Photographer of the Royal House), allowing him to photograph the everyday life of the Brazilian monarchy during the Reign of Pedro II, even photographing the emperor Dom Pedro II and his family. This title would give his photographs increased recognition and raise their price. But his principal contribution to the history of Brazilian photography is his photographic record of  the different social classes in Brazil in the 19th century: portraits, usually in the carte de visite format, taken of the nobility, of rich tradesmen, of the middle-class, and of black people, either slaves or free, in a period  before the Lei \u00c1urea."

This was followed by the writings of adventurers and scientists such as Johann Baptist Emanuel Pohl, author of Viagem no Interior do Brasil, Empreendida nos Anos de 1817 a 1821 e Publicada por Ordem de Sua Majestade o Imperador da \u00c1ustria Francisco Primeiro (Voyage in the Interior of Brazil. Launched in the Years of 1817 to 1821 and Published by the Order of His Majesty the Emperor of Austria Franscisco First), in which he describes his journey through the country with wonder and enthusiasm, his words accompanied by luxuriant illustrations. About Rio de Janeiro, Pohl wrote: If some place in the New World deserves, for its location and natural conditions, to become one day a theater of big events, a center of civilization and culture, an emporium of worldwide commerce, it is, in my opinion, Rio de Janeiro. I cannot, here, repress this observation. Willingly hovers the fantasy on the future of such charming country, that is at present little developed and, so to speak, does not have a past.\u2014Johann Emmanuel Pohl Certainly these narrations and illustrations were  the principal attractions for those German photographers of the 19th century that moved to Brazil, such as Revert Henrique Klumb, Augusto Stahl, Karl Ernst Papf, and Alberto Henschel."

In 1867, Henschel separated from Gutzlaff and returned to Germany, where he updated his technique and acquired new equipment for his atelier of photography. He returned to Brazil in the same year, opening another establishment with the same company name in the city of Salvador, on Piedade street, number 16. By opening three establishments in only two years, Henschel was thought of as the most audacious and sagacious photographic businessman  in 19th century Brazil. By the end of the 1860s, Henschel's houses of Recife and Salvador were already making portraits of people of African origin, slaves and free, differing from other photographers by portraying them freely and with dignity as people and not as objects."

        "content": "In 1870, Henschel opened another subsidiary of his atelier, this time in Rio de Janeiro, on Ourives street (nowadays Miguel Couto street, number 40). It was in Rio, capital of the Empire, where he started his prosperous partnership with Francisco Benque. With the name of Henschel & Benque, it specialized in the production and marketing of portraits,  landscapes, and  the photopaintings made by Karl Ernst Papf, whose presence in Brazil was due to Henschel. There are no records dating when the relationship with Benque crumbled; it is probable that their association remained until 1880. Because of the quality of his work and his success  in the Court, Henschel received the title of Photographo da Casa Imperial (Photographer of the Royal House) on 7 September 1874, together with Benque, which would give his photographs increased recognition and raise their price. The historian photographer Gilberto Ferrez describes the quality and importance of Henschel as follows: Henschel participated in many exhibitions of photographs, standing out in the exposition of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in 1872 and 1875, for which he received the Gold Medal in the first edition. He also participated in the IV National Exposition and the Universal Exposition of Vienna, in Austria, where he received the Merit Medal."

        "content": "On 1 February 1882, Henschel inaugurated another establishment, this time in the capital of the province of S\u00e3o Paulo. He gave it the name  Photographia Imperial (Imperial Photography) because the name Photographia Allem\u00e3 had already been used since 1875 by the atelier of the photographer Carlos Hoenen. His arrival in S\u00e3o Paulo was considered important because, besides being holder of the prestigious title of Photographo da Casa Imperial, he came directly from the Court. The newspaper A Prov\u00edncia de S\u00e3o Paulo (currently O Estado de S. Paulo), while describing with minimal details the new atelier in its inaugural day edition, related the enthusiasm with which Henschel was received by the residents of S\u00e3o Paulo. Henschel died in Rio de Janeiro that same year, only some months after establishing himself in S\u00e3o Paulo. However, his companies, under the command of other businessmen, continued to strategically  use his name for many years, taking advantage of the great prestige that the mark \"Henschel\" had acquired."

He always remained  up-to-date with the latest techniques  on the photography market. By the time the aesthetic format of photography carte de visite became popular, Henschel was  already dominating this technique which he used frequently in his establishments. His studios possessed the latest  equipment appropriate for the instantaneous portraits of children who, never still, were the headaches of the photographers. In his announcement in the Novo Almanach de S\u00e3o Paulo para o Anno de 1883 (New Almanac of S\u00e3o Paulo for the Year of 1883), Henschel advertised: This establishment just received from Europe the negatives for the new process of instantaneous photographies that have so much success there. Through these chichets one can obtain a more perfect portrait of a moving child, of nervous people... The public is invited to come examine in the establishment some portraits obtained by the new process. The new process referred to in the announcement was the use of dry slabs of transparent gelatin, used as an adhesive layer for the fixation of the silver salts over the paper. He photographed all the different social classes of Brazil in the 19th century. Besides the Brazilian monarchy and black people, he also photographed the nobility, the rich tradesmen and their families, and the white middle-class."

        "content": "Eustathius or Eustace of Mtskheta (Evstat'i Mtskhet'eli; ) (died  550) is an Orthodox Christian saint, executed for his apostasy from Zoroastrianism by the Sasanian military authorities in Caucasian Iberia (Kartli, eastern Georgia). His story is related in the anonymous 6th-century Georgian hagiographic novel The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta. One of the earliest extant works of the Georgian literature, The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta (\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10e2\u10f3\u10da\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0\u10f2 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10db\u10dd\u10d7\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0\u10f2 \u10ec\u10db\u10d8\u10d3\u10d8\u10e1\u10d0 \u10d4\u10d5\u10e1\u10e2\u10d0\u10d7\u10d8 \u10db\u10ea\u10ee\u10d4\u10d7\u10d4\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d0\u10f2) was written by an anonymous author later in the 6th century, within thirty years of Eustathius' reported death. The morphology of the work as well as some theological phrases also supports this dating, although the earliest surviving manuscript dates from c. 1000 (Georgian National Center of Manuscripts, MSS H-341). The text is also interesting for the first Georgian formulation of the Ten Commandments, an account of the life of Jesus which recalls Tatian's Diatessaron (a Gospel harmony of the 2nd century), and traces of influence of the 2nd century Apology of Aristides. The Passion was first published by Mikhail Sabinin in 1882. Eustathius is reported by the hagiographer to have been an Iranian cobbler originally called Gvirobandak, son of a high-ranking Zoroastrian priest (magi), from Ganzak. Having converted to Christianity, he flees persecution to Georgia (Iberia), then under the Iranian military authority, in 541. He settles at the Christian town of Mtskheta and marries a Christian woman. The local Iranian cobblers\u2019 guild denounces Eustathius to the marzban Arvand Gushnasp with seven other converts to be judged. Arvand punishes the apostates by having their noses pierced and casts them in prison under sentence of death. Six months later, Arvand releases them, however, as a farewell gesture to the local people, when recalled from Georgia by the king Khosrau I. Four years later, under the new marzban Vezhan Buzmihr, Eustathius is rearrested, but reaffirms his faith before the court in a speech of some 3,000 words that makes up nearly half the Passion. Eventually, the marzban, albeit reluctant, has him beheaded in Tbilisi. The remains of Eustathius were taken to Mtskheta and buried at its principal church."

He was excused from conventional education and entered the Brno Conservatory with a state scholarship, before continuing on to the Music Academy of the Academy of Performing Arts in Bratislava (where he studied alongside Lucia Popp and Edita Gruberov\u00e1), graduating with honors. Soon after, aged 21, he was named as an \"artist of the State\". Bulva's subsequent intense international concert schedule was interrupted in 1971 for an entire year by a serious accident. He subsequently emigrated to the west for political reasons, taking residence first in Munich and then in Luxembourg, where he resumed his concert and recording activities. In 1996 Bulva injured his left hand in another accident, with what was thought to be permanent damage, forcing him to end his career as a professional pianist. However, after an operation by Swiss hand surgeon Beat Simmen, Bulva regained full control of his hand and recommenced his career in November and December 2009, after a pause of 13 years, performing concerts in Augsburg, Munich, Zurich and Stuttgart. He died in Monaco. Bulva's repertoire included works by Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, Scriabin, Rachmaninov and contemporary composers. In some cases he has made his own arrangements of existing compositions, such as Liszt\u2019s \"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\" and Wagner's Tannh\u00e4user Overture."

He insists on being treated like a priest: 'You should do what I say and not what I do.' He knows how to construct his image. Employees are allegedly received in extravagant villas and greeted with a tiger on a leash.

She had a younger sister, Adelaide, born three years later. Struggling as a painter, Marshall Claxton emigrated with his family in 1850 to Australia, where his brother-in-law Richard Hargrave had established himself as a settler in New South Wales. Other family members emigrated as well, including Lawrence Hargrave, who became an aeronautical pioneer. Claxton's arrival in Sydney was celebrated in the newspapers, but he once again struggled to find the fame he desired. The family moved on yet again in 1854, this time to India. After a three-year stay, the family returned to England via Ceylon and Egypt. The experience of international travel proved to be formulative to the sisters as artists, \"both expanding the geographic scope of their subject matter and equipping them with something of an outsider's perspective on Victorian society.\" The Claxton sisters were returned to England She was just about 20 years old when she signed an 1859 petition asking the Royal Academy of Arts to open its doors to women.  Her father trained Florence and her sister in his craft; Florence travelled with her father to Australia, India, and Egypt in the years from 1850 to 1857, while he searched for employment. In the later 1850s both sisters found work in the production of engravings for the popular press. In 1860, Florence illustrated Married Off: A Satirical Poem, by \"H. B.\" In 1858, Florence exhibited her painting Scenes from the Life of a Female Artist in the second annual show of the Society of Women Artists. In the following year, 1859, she signed a petition advocating the admission of women to the Royal Academy Schools, and exhibited her Scenes of Life of an Old Maid in the Society of Women Artists show. In 1864, the sisters were apparently sharing a home together in London, but their paths separated. On 1 June 1868, Florence married Ernest Farrington, a French photographer and engineer,  in Paris. Little is known of their married life, but Florence claimed to have lived in Monaco for some years. There were no children from the marriage and she was widowed likely by 1881, when she was back living alone with her father in London. Florence did not remarry and was later estranged from her sister. She continued to work as an illustrator and artist. On 3 May 1920, at her home, Grafton House in Sandown, Isle of Wight, she died by suicide by taking a fatal overdose of veronal \"in a carefully planned suicide.\""

        "content": "Claxton's best-known work is The Choice of Paris: An Idyll (c. 1860), a satire on, and parody of, the works of the Pre-Raphaelite artists of the previous years. The painting is patterned after William Holman Hunt's A Converted British Family sheltering a Christian Missionary from the persecution of the Druids, and combines caricatures of many of the main figures of the movement, including John Ruskin and Sir John Everett Millais, with figures of popular culture like P. T. Barnum, and allusions to the great artists of the past. It depicts Millais in the role of Paris, offering the golden apple to a scrawny-looking medieval woman, ignoring a Raphael madonna (copied from The Marriage of the Virgin) and a modern woman in crinolines. The painting also includes parodies of other Pre-Raphaelite works, including Millais' Sir Isumbras at the Ford, Spring: Apple Blossoms and The Vale of Rest. It also caricatures Calderon's Broken Vows and Windus's Burd Helen. The picture was reproduced as a full-page wood-engraving by the Illustrated London News on 2 June 1860."

In Utopian Christmas, reproduced in the Illustrated London News of 24 December 1859, the poor - barefooted and raggedly-dressed - are shown feasting at a lavish banquet and being served and entertained by the rich - depicted as generals, nobles, and finely-dressed ladies. Other works by Claxton include Women's Work: A Medley (1861) and Scenes from the Life of a Governess (1863). Women's Work may have been a feminist riposte to Ford Madox Brown's painting Work, which focused on men's labors but neglected women. Florence Claxton married a \"Mr. Farrington, of Romsey,\" in 1868, but continued to work and exhibit at least sporadically afterward. Claxton also wrote humorous skits on feminism and women's rights, most notably in The Adventures of a Woman in Search of her Rights, a story in cartoon form. In the book, a young woman falls in love with a dashing youth, but her parents do not approve and her lover leaves. She decides to pursue her rights. She loses her looks through the study of John Stuart Mill and; now made ugly, she pursues various careers, becoming a lawyer, a politician and a doctor, but eventually fails in all of her pursuits. She finally emigrates to the United States and marries Brigham Young, the polygamous Mormon leader. In the end, it turns out to have been all a dream and she ends with the words \"thank goodness it's only a midsummer night's dream and I'm not emancipated\"."

        "content": "Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107\u2019s strong presence in the popular media as a public personality, and his very charismatic appearance, constitute the major obstacles in grasping the specificity of the discourses he develops in order to intervene in the field of contemporary art and culture. What usually happens when his works, especially the ones that feature images of himself, are interpreted without insight into the grammar of visual language and into the conceptual strategies he uses, can easily be designated as a \u201cnaturalistic mistake\u201d. It consists of equating micro-histories of his personal biography, as the biography of an empirical person who is the author of certain artworks, with the narratives that make up the visual content of those works, and with the features of the represented characters. The fact that he gets engaged with popular culture both in the fields of subcultures and of cultural industries (as an actor, radio host, underground punk musician), and in the field of critical and experimental visual art (as an author who recycles samples and schematics of popular culture in his work, which is mostly figural) gets condensed into a view of his works as functioning as \u201cthe organic representations\u201d of those mechanisms of cultural production and of those subcultures. \u201cIt is about the projection of personality as a mediator of ideas\u201d, said Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 in an interview published in 1996, explaining the role of his own image in the paintings he was producing at the time, adding that the \u201cself-portrait makes it a historically determined model, the specific feature being that, in this case, the image of the author is activated as a part of the content by being included in the representation\u201d.  From this quote, it is quite clear that, at least on the level of intentionality, the image of the author is not used as a simple mirror-image of himself or of his identity belongings and affiliations, but as a tool for conceptual manoeuvres. Therefore, Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 may appear as an \u201corganic intellectual\u201d, in the sense of visually codifying and making more coherent, presenting and making more broadly present in the public, a specific shared non-hegemonic and, both culturally and socially, underrepresented world-view \u201cin a way that is directive and organizational, i.e. educative, i.e. intellectual\u201d,  but he does not do that as someone who enters the field of art from the outside. He does that as an artist fully belonging to it, and being formed by it, and within it. Thereby, he acts in a synthetic manner, as a link between the life worlds where minor cultures are developed, and the elitist art world, as defined in its hegemonic role. Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 even made that clear himself in a discussion with the local art critic and art journalist Danijela Pure\u0161evi\u0107, by stating the following: \u201cI use figuration the way Duchamp used ready-made. I use figuration dually. And I am not a figurative painter. I am a pure conceptualist\u201d. Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 is not a punk who paints. He performs conceptual manoeuvres by using a specific \u201cpainterly style\u201d (or \u201cstyle of representation\u201d in his later works that are not paintings) treated as a ready-made. That enables him to resample different historical styles without actually paying tribute either to the artists who originally used them or to the actual times and contexts of use. He uses the surface of the painting, drawing, photography or a digital collage as a screen for projecting, not his own empirically and psychologically framed visions and desires, but those specific social issues that go far beyond what is screened in the public media or conventionally shown in major art shows. By using his own image in paintings, photographs, and digital collages, he produces an art of signs, an art of discourse, questioning the effects of visual images on the usual perception of identity, history and culture, and testing the implications of the use of these images for the art system and the models of perception of artworks as such. The subjectivity he demonstrates is not simply taken for granted but is already \u201cdeconstructed, taken apart, and shifted, without anchorage\u201d.  It is rooted in language and effective in the realm of the symbolic. In his work, he places his self-representations at quite a distance from the psycho-biographic realm, which would be just visualized. As Roland Barthes stated, the life of the author cannot be considered as \u201cthe origin of his fables, but a fable that runs concurrently with his work.\u201d"

        "content": "In 1994, Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 wrote, together with Stevan Marku\u0161, a manifesto entitled \u201cThe Autonomism Manifesto\u201d. It was written in February and March 1994, and published as a leaflet, to be later included in the catalogue of their joint exhibition, held in Pan\u010devo in June 1995. \u201cIt was created to reduce to a minimum the possibility of shallow stories about our painting\u201d, stated their text of the Manifesto, referring to the history of its own making. Going back to the experiences of the local historical avant-gardes, namely, Zenitism, whose manifesto these artists not only quoted in their own manifesto but even claimed to repeat, they looked for a way to avoid being listed among the \u201curban section\u201d of \u201cfigurative painters\u201d, following the \u201cother line\u201d of former Yugoslav art, who institutionalized those practices within the histories of neo-avant-gardes, of neo-constructivists, conceptual and process art movements, considered to be tendencies of \u201cradical\u201d,  as opposed to \u201csoft\u201d modernism. They also did not feel quite comfortable with the concept of \u201cmonumental intimism\u201d,  which placed them amongst the authors active in the \u201cinterspace between high art and the underground\u201d,  with \u0110ile Markovi\u0107 and Zoran Marinkovi\u0107, in the close proximity of authors such as Daniel Glid and Jasmina Kali\u0107. Their use of images was more denaturalized than those of the artists who were reputedly stylistically close to them. Their relationship with the \u201cunderground\u201d, on the other hand, was on the level of repetition of visual samples that were part of the imagery of empowerment, but in a context that was not the context of subcultures \u2013 they played with different rhetorical operations within the language of art, but materialized mainly as paintings of conventional format, and executed in conventional techniques, like oil on canvas. \u201cWe are classics\u201d, they stated, in an ironic manner, while they were still students, and they said that in order to oppose classifications.  They wanted histories of their own, ones that escape the constraints of theory-led production, art-historian-dominated interpretation, and exhibiting within the framework imposed by curators. They wanted to create the context in which their work is produced, viewed and exhibited. That was Autonomism. In the late nineties, Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 started exhibiting mainly without Stevan Marku\u0161. He switched his preferred techniques from oil painting and charcoal drawing to electronic collages, photographs, performances and whatever else might come as the most appropriate medium for the realization of some concrete project. What he kept was a passionate attachments to self-portraits, so that his own image still played the \u201ctheoretical object\u201d in most of the works, only the process and the final result were much more open with respect to the manner of realization that before. His major project for the end of the nineties, and the project through which he developed another referential frame for his works, was entitled The Populist Project. As the author stated himself, the main objective of the project was to show the interaction between the star system and identity. Its components were titled God Loves the Dreams of Serbian Artists, Celebrities, Hometown Boys and Pioneers. The images of the author featured in different segments of the project, presenting him as part of the most prominent football teams in Europe, in the company of various public personalities, on the cover of an imaginary magazine entitled \u201cHometown Boys\u201d, and among the most prominent authors in the field of art production and interpretation from what was once geopolitically labelled as Eastern Europe, all of whom were shown as proudly wearing a red pioneer scarf, in a glorious posture taken from the iconography of socialist realism. With this project, he went against the stereotypical social and political, not so much art-historical framing of his works. While most left-wing scholars in Serbia dealt with the issue of populism as determined to serve the right wing ideology, he demonstrated that populism had no pre-articulated social implication, and that in order to enter the struggle in the public arena, one has to be able to articulate it. His manner of articulation was rooted in the antagonistic potential of all the popular interpellations, connecting his populist project with the heritage of populist anarchism, which reappeared locally on the grass roots level whenever the local population was to be turned into members of a nation, party, etc. Instead of producing representations of all the invisible parts of the society within the field of art, which is the prevailing paradigm of socially specific works, he went directly into the populist media to work on antagonizing the attitudes towards the public images of celebrities, including his own, using those media the way he used canvas.

In her own words: I use the Galician Language as a literary language because I have a forked tongue, however not all the creatures with a forked tongue are bad. I think that all stories and poems are messages written in ink, spittle or blood, that we throw into space wishing that somebody receives them."

She has resided in Galicia since 1973 and has adopted the Galician language as her literary language. She is now one of the most famous Galician language writers. In her own words: I remember some things of every city where I lived: Ceuta (the lemon tree that we had in our courtyard); Do\u00f1a Menc\u00eda (eating figs at the crack of dawn with my father); Madrid (the cinema club of Areneros, where I saw \"Freaks\" for the first time); Vigo (the mimosas in blossom); Santiago de Compostela...and other cities where I never lived or where I only lived for a short time: Donostia, Perugia, Boston. And I have a special relationship with Toba, C\u00e9e and with a Costa da Morte.

On his paternal side, he was a member of the aristocratic Pineton de Chambrun family. Moreover, Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza was one of his paternal uncles. Chambrun's godfather was Philippe P\u00e9tain. Chambrun was a great-great-grandson of Lafayette. As a result, he was both a French and U.S. citizen. His U.S. citizenship was questioned by members of the United States House of Representatives in 1942 due to his support for his father-in-law. Chambrun graduated from Sciences Po.

        "content": "Chambrun was a lawyer at the Court of Appeals of Paris and the New York State Bar Association. By 1935, he helped establish a Franco-American cultural center in New York City to promote bilateral relations. The center was aimed at students and businessmen. When the Second World War broke out, Chambrun served as a captain, but, with the collapse of France looming by mid-May 1940, the Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, sent Chambrun as a special emissary to Washington to stiffen President Roosevelt's resolve to help the Allies. Between his first meeting with Roosevelt on 16 June and his last on 1 August, Reynaud's government had fallen. Later that year Chambrun published the book I Saw France Fall, which helped to alert American opinion about the fate of his country. After the Liberation of France and the consequent fall of Laval's collaborationist government, Chambrun was a defender of Laval: The Chambruns threw themselves into the task of assisting Laval in his defense before the High Court of Justice. After Laval's sentence and execution in October 1945, Chambrun was put on police watch in Paris on the suspicion that he may have helped the Nazis during the war; in 1942 Chambrun had been named on a list of French collaborators with Germany to be killed during the war, or tried after it. By 1947, Chambrun officially applied for a U.S. passport. Meanwhile, Chambrun and his wife devoted their energies over the following decades to the cause of his rehabilitation in the eyes of history. For example, he wrote a letter to President Dwight Eisenhower in which he objected to his characterisation of Laval as \"Hitler's most evil puppet\" in his 1948 memoir entitled Crusade in Europe. Chambrun based his argument on another book authored by Spanish Foreign Minister Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er in which the latter quoted Hitler describing Laval as \"no better than De Gaulle\". By 1949, Eisenhower agreed to remove the passage from subsequent reprints. A decade later, in 1959, his wife wrote the foreword of Tout ce qu'on vous a cache, a book based on \"German secret files\" authored by Jacques Baraduc, Laval's lawyer. The book attempted to show that Laval \"refused repeatedly to yield to German demands for a reduction in the number of United States agents in French North Africa and a limitation on their activity.\" In 1969, Chambrun made an appearance in Marcel Oph\u00fcls's documentary on collaboration between the Vichy government and Nazi Germany during World War II, The Sorrow and the Pity (Le chagrin et la piti\u00e9). Chambrun wrote three books on the subject between 1983 and 1990. The Chambruns set up a foundation, the Jos\u00e9e and Ren\u00e9 de Chambrun Foundation, which collected documents on Laval for publication by the Hoover Institution.  After Laval's death, the Chambruns brought flowers to his grave every 15 October, to commemorate the day he was executed. After World War II, Chambrun was hired by Peter II of Yugoslavia when the latter filed for divorce in 1953; the couple reconciled two years later. He represented fashion designer Coco Chanel when she sued manufacturer Pierre Wertheimer to regain the marketing rights to her perfume, Chanel No. 5. Wertheimer settled the case, and Chanel became a millionaire as a result. In 1970 Chambrun defended Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos over false allegations that he killed his ex-wife, Eugenia Livanos. Additionally, Chambrun was hired by Somerset Maugham's daughter to prove that she was indeed his daughter. Chambrun served as the chairman of Baccarat, the crystal manufacturer, from 1960 to 1992."

Their wedding was held at the town hall of the 7th arrondissement of Paris, followed by the Sainte-Clotilde the next day. They resided 6 bis, Place du Palais-Bourbon in the 7th arrondissement. In 1935, he bought the Ch\u00e2teau de la Grange-Bl\u00e9neau, a castle in the commune of Courpalay in the Seine-et-Marne d\u00e9partement of France, from his cousin, Louis de Lasteyrie, a descendant of La Fayette, with a life tenancy. Upon Louis de Lasteyrie's death in 1955, Chambrun discovered the large cache of documents in the attic of the castle, and he founded a private museum about Lafayette. News of his discovery brought many historians to his door, but Chambrun denied access, except to Andr\u00e9 Maurois whom he authorized to write a biography of Adrienne de Lafayette. Chambrun produced a book using the documents he discovered covering the period of 1792\u201397 when Lafayette was in an Austrian prison.  He organized and described the family archives, a collection dating from 1457 to 1990. The papers were microfilmed at La Grange in 1995 and 1996, for the Library of Congress.  It took two years and several microfilm teams from the Library of Congress to film the 50,000 pages. Lafayette's papers are now in the Cornell University Library. Meanwhile, Chambrun purchased a sword used in battle by Lafayette in 1976, outbidding the Smithsonian Institution. Chambrun served as the honorary president of the Sons of the American Revolution in France. He became a Chevalier (knight) of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. Chambrun died on 19 May 2002 in Paris, France. His funeral, held at Sainte-Clotilde, was attended by Diana Mitford, the widow of British fascist leader Oswald Mosley. He was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery."

At the Gymnasium, he was taught the basics in latin and history and he graduated with fourteen years of age. Afterwards he concluded a chancellery apprenticeship in Yverdon and Geneva where he learned the French language which would be useful in later career as a diplomate. In 1611, as he was 17 years old, he married Anna Maria Falkner a noble woman from Basel. The Historical Lexicon of Switzerland records that Wettstein's marriage was not a happy one. With time he owed quite a sum to his wife's family and apparently for that reason he moved to Italy in 1616, where he served in the Venetian military."

As Wettstein travelled by ship to M\u00fcnster in 1646, he was not invited, much less was he in possession of an accreditation by the Swiss Confederacy. He was only provided with a mandate by the reformists. From the Swiss confederacy he received the official accreditation only in 1647 and after a long and skillful mediation, he achieved the official recognition of the Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire on the 24 October 1648. In memory of this achievement Basel minted a coin and the merchants of Basel donated a trophy. He had a second diplomatic journey accompanied by Sebastian Peregrin Zwyer in winter 1650/51, this time before Emperor Ferdinand III. Following the Frankfurter trade fair in October 1650, the German Court in Speyer, ordered the seizure of certain goods from the merchants in Basel and after some negotiations in Viennas Hofburg, the two achieved their liberation. Ferdinand ordered the goods restitution to the merchants of Basel, together with the payment of a fine of 100 Marks in Gold. In exchange Wettstein and Zwyer agreed to an Austrian demand, that Swiss soldiers wouldn't participate in battles which would expand the French territories."

He is generally acknowledged as one of the most competent Swiss politicians of his era, but also as a prominent exponent of the absolutist tendencies within the Swiss Confederacy. Associated with Switzerland's independence, Wettstein's name first became prominent around 1750, and reached its zenith during World War II, when the country's sovereignty was challenged once more. A bridge bearing his name was built across the Rhine in Basel in 1881.

        "content": "Bryan Maris Stephens (July 14, 1920 \u2013 November 21, 1991) was an American professional baseball player. The native of Fayetteville, Arkansas, a right-handed pitcher, appeared in 74 Major League games \u2014 31 for the  Cleveland Indians and 43 for the  St. Louis Browns. He stood  tall and weighed . Stephens attended Washington High School in Los Angeles County, California, and signed with the Detroit Tigers in 1939. The following season he was acquired by the Indians and spent 1940\u20131942 in their farm system, winning 20 of 24 decisions in 1942 for the Class B Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League. He then missed the 1943\u20131945 seasons while serving in the United States Army during World War II. After one more year of minor league seasoning in 1946, Stephens made the 1947 Indians' roster. In his first Major League appearance, as a starting pitcher on May 15 against the Washington Senators at Griffith Stadium, Stephens scattered eight hits, all singles, in a complete game, 9\u20131 triumph over eventual Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Early Wynn. Sent to the bullpen by manager Lou Boudreau, Stephens then went over a month before his next starting assignment \u2014 again at Washington and against Wynn. This time, on June 19, Stephens took the loss, 3\u20132, and left for a pinch hitter after the fifth inning. Altogether, he made five starts for Cleveland was used exclusively as a relief pitcher after July 15. He fashioned a 5\u201310 win\u2013loss mark and a 4.01 earned run average, with one save, in 92 innings pitched for the Indians. Stephens was traded on November 20, 1947, with $25,000, Joe Frazier, and Dick Kokos for Walt Judnich and Bob Muncrief. Stephens worked out of the bullpen early in the 1948 season before making six successive starts during June; however, he lost his first four decisions before throwing another complete game, a 9\u20136 win over the Boston Red Sox at Sportsman's Park, winning the game himself by driving in three runs with an eighth-inning double off Mel Parnell.  (Bryan Stephens was one of three players with a similar surname who played in that game, including Boston's Vern Stephens and the Browns' first baseman, Chuck Stevens.) But Bryan Stephens' year with the Browns had few bright spots: he collected three saves and posted three wins, against six losses, with a poor 6.02 earned run average in  innings pitched.  He spent the next two seasons, his last as a professional, in the minors. All told, Stephens allowed 220 hits and 106 bases on balls in  Major League innings pitched, with 69 strikeouts."

He was the son of Field Marshal Michael Gallitzin and grandson of Prince Boris Kurakin. In the late 1750s, Prince Gallitzin resided in Paris where he headed the Russian embassy during the Seven Years' War. His beautiful wife Catherine died there in 1761. Her liaison with actress La Clairon gained great notoriety. Catherine was the daughter of Dimitrie Cantemir, the former ruler of Moldavia, by Princess Anastasiya Trubetskaya. She was also the sister of Antiochus Cantemir. From 1761 to 1792 he was Russian ambassador to Austria, with the poet Ludwig Heinrich von Nicolay as his secretary. Catherine the Great bestowed on him the Order of St. Andrew for negotiating the First Partition of Poland with Emperor Joseph II. The prince was acclaimed for having returned to Russia the lands annexed by his patrilineal ancestor, Grand Duke Gediminas. In the winter of 1782 Mozart was engaged for all the concerts given by Gallitzin who \"placed his carriage at my disposal both going and returning, and treated me in the handsomest manner possible\". Gallitzinberg is the hill near Vienna where the Russian ambassador built his residence (with an artificial Roman ruin and a round temple still standing). Gallitzinstra\u00dfe in Vienna is also named after him. The childless Prince Gallitzin, wishing to keep the memory of his wife alive for future generations, spent a fortune to establish the Golitsyn Hospital in Moscow. His palace in Vienna boasted several hundred paintings by Old Masters. After his death, these paintings were exhibited in the gallery of the Golitsyn Hospital before being auctioned off in order to finance the hospital's extension."

        "content": "Teresia Kieuea Teaiwa was born in Honolulu, Hawaii and raised in Suva, Fiji. Her father was i-Kiribati from Banaba and her mother was African American. She had two sisters, Katerina Teaiwa and Maria Teaiwa-Rutherford. She attended St Joseph's Secondary School where she excelled. Teaiwa received a Bachelor of Arts from Trinity Washington University in Washington D.C. and a Master of Arts from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. With a thesis committee of James Clifford, Angela Davis and Barbara Epstein, she completed a PhD in History of Consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz on, \"Militarism, Tourism and the Native: Articulations in Oceania\". Throughout her career, Teaiwa maintained a full teaching schedule. In 1996, she turned down a job with Greenpeace to take up her first lecturer position at the University of the South Pacific in Suva, Fiji, at the request of Pacific Studies and Tongan scholar Epeli Hau'ofa. She taught history and politics for five years. Throughout this time, Teaiwa was part of intellectual communities that stemmed from the university environment, such as the Niu Waves Writers\u2019 Collective, the Nuclear Free and Independent Pacific Movement, and the Citizens\u2019 Constitutional Forum. In 2000, she moved to New Zealand to teach the first-ever undergraduate major in Pacific studies at Victoria University as programme director. In 2016, she became director of Va\u2019aoman\u016b Pasifika, home to Victoria's Pacific and Samoan Studies programmes. She was also co-editor of the International Feminist Journal of Politics. In September 2021 Teaiwa's book Sweat and Salt Water, was published in New Zealand by Victoria University of Wellington Press. The book is a compilation of her most notable essays, poems, and scholarly articles regarding her major contributions and commitment to the Pacific region and its peoples. The title of the book is derived from a quote that was requested by Hau'ofa for his 1988 essay The Ocean in Us, in which she stated, \"We sweat and cry salt water, so we know the ocean is really in our blood.\""

Following his postdoctoral work, he went in 1960 to Istanbul, Turkey, and took up a post at Robert College (later Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University). He subsequently taught courses there in physics, the history of science and astronomy, including the course \"The Emergence of Modern Science, East and West\", with sojourns in New York City, Boston, London, Athens, Oxford, and Venice. He returned to Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University in 1993. Freely was the author of more than 40 books."

        "content": "Gualberto Fabricio de Vagad was an Aragonese Cistercian Benedictine monk and the first historian of the Kingdom of Aragon. He was born in Zaragoza in the first third of the fifteenth century and straddles the line between the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. He lived most of his life at the monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Santa Fe, though he also spent some time at San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a. According to F\u00e9lix de Latassa y Ort\u00edn, besides history he wrote various treatises on poetry and a compendium of verse. Vagad's magnum opus, the Cr\u00f3nica de Arag\u00f3n, a vernacular Romance history of Aragon from the mythical Kingdom of Sobrarbe (founded 724) up to the death of Alfonso V (1458), was published in Zaragoza in 1499; its incunabula survive. It was commissioned by the deputies of Ferdinand II of Aragon, who named Vagad cronista mayor (senior chronicler), though the office of cronista was not formally instituted until the Cortes of Monz\u00f3n in 1547. For the work Vagad consulted the archives of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a, San Victori\u00e1n, Poblet, Montearag\u00f3n, and Barcelona among other archives of the Crown of Aragon. In international matters he was a Spanish partisan and this bias enters into his history: he considered the Emperor Maximilian I a Spaniard and made the legendary Count Julian an Italian. In peninsular matters his Aragonese bias is evident, as when he devalues the conquest of Valencia by the Castilian folk hero El Cid (1094) relative to the conquest of the same city by James I of Aragon (1236). The work contains three prologues. In the first Vagad heaps praise on Spain in the tradition of Isidore's Laus Spaniae; in the second he argues from history for the preeminence of Aragon amongst the kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula; and in the third he defends the importance of Zaragoza as the chief city of Spain. Preoccupied with style, his narrative is frequently interrupted by lengthy and banal arguments. Eduard Fueter, the Swiss historian of universal historiography, writes that Vagad's Cr\u00f3nica contains the \"timid critical germs of the medieval tradition\" (t\u00edmidos g\u00e9rmenes de cr\u00edtica de la tradici\u00f3n medieval)."

Clark is a fiber artist known for using a variety of materials including human hair and combs to address race, culture, class, and history. Her beaded headdress assemblages and braided wig series of the late 1990s, which received critical acclaim, evoked African traditions of personal adornment and moved these common forms into the realm of personal and political expression. Although African art and her Caribbean background are important influences, Clark also builds on practices of assemblage and accumulation used by artists such as Betye Saar and David Hammons."

These artists have mastered a craft impossible for me to take for granted.\" She claims, \"hair is power,\" and, \"as carrier of DNA, hair holds the essence of identity.\" \"I grew up braiding my hair and my sister's hair, so in one sense, like many black women, I had been preparing to be a textile artist for a very long time.\" Clark further considered the hair strand as a tool for communication and worked with graphic designer Boquin Peng to create an alphabet based on the curl pattern of her hair called Twist."

        "content": "Clark's explorations with flags began with her thesis Kente Flag Project in 1995. This work is a mixture of elements from African and Western/American culture. She weaves Kente patterns into the design for strength and endurance, advancement and achievement, and prosperity. Since 2009, Clark has created serial projects surrounding the Confederate Battle Flag. She has performed Unraveling in June 2015 at the now-defunct Mixed Greens gallery in New York City and then at the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, in October 2016. Her more resent presentation of the exhibit in Louisville Kentucky \"was the first performance under the current presidential administration and since the country has found itself embroiled in debate over the presence and ramifications of Confederate imagery in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, this past summer.\" \"The act is now a part of a larger movement through which state and local governments are dismantling these objects out of a sense of civic duty.\" During the exhibition, members of the audience are encouraged to join Clark one at a time in the unraveling of a confederate flag while she explains her vision and demonstrates how to pull the strands of the flag apart. According to Goodman, \"Clark stands side-by-side by participants, shoulder-to-shoulder as they pull each strand of the flag and confront the reality it represents\". In April 2018, Clark returned to her alma mater, Amherst College, to perform \"Unravelling\" at the Mead Art Museum. In 2017, Clark created a hand woven linen cloth reproduction of the white dish towel used by a Confederate soldier to surrender at the Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.  This piece is known as \"Monumental Cloth (sutured)\". It is the artist's hope that this flag of truce becomes as well known as the Confederate Battle Flag. Both \"Unravelling\" and \"Monumental Cloth (sutured)\" were on display at the Mead Art Museum from April 5, 2018, to July 1, 2018.  Clark reproduced the Truce Flag with the intention of drawing attention back to the flag that brokered and to the Civil War, questioning why symbols of white supremacy, such as the Confederate Battle Flag, are memorialized in favor of symbols of peace. A larger immersive outgrowth of the project \"Monumental Cloth: the Flag We Should Know\" was made in collaboration with and exhibited at The Fabric Workshop and Museum"

His research interests focus in the area of Soft Computing, but applied in several fields (Botany, Manufacturing, Telecommunication, Bioinformatics, Computer music, Cosmology, Didactics, Cyclostratigraphy, Information Theory, Signal Processing and bodybuilding). The relation between the evolutionary chain culminating in Homo sapiens and the estimated size of our universe (discovered in 1999 by him and the physicist Antonio Feoli) resolved a long debate in the Anthropic principle. The HS3D  dataset of Homo Sapiens DNA regions (2001) is used to assess the prediction accuracy of methods for gene identification and characterization. As active supporter of transhumanism, an international intellectual and cultural movement supporting the use of science and technology to improve human mental and physical characteristics and capacities, in 2004 he began an intense applied research program as competition bodybuilder. In 2005 he won the Over 40 WPF Italian Bodybuilding Championship."

He is the primary songwriter and lead singer of his band Cafeine and has also released music under alternate spellings; Caf\u00e9ine, Xavier Caf\u00e9\u00efne, or Caf\u00e9\u00efne. Xavier received formal Jazz-Pop bass training at the C\u00e9gep Marie-Victorin school in Montreal. His first release was the indie-punk album Mal \u00e9duqu\u00e9 mon amour in 1998 sung entirely in French. The follow up album Pornstar was released in 2000, leaning toward a more glam rock sound, with English lyrics. Xavier formed a band called Poxy and released their self-titled album in 2004, followed by Artificial Pleasures in 2007. In August 2006, he released Gis\u00e8le on Indica Records as a solo project. Once again Xavier wrote the music, sang and performed most of the instruments on his album. Additional drums were recorded by his friend Michel Langevin of Voivod. Gis\u00e8le considered a classic French-language punk rock album, earning two ADISQ 2007 nominations for \"Best Rock Album of the Year\" and \"Best Male Artist\", and winning the GAMIQ 2007 award for \"Best Rock Album\". The Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada awarded him the \"2008 Discovery of the Year Song\" award for \"La fin du monde\". Cafeine's most recent album New Love was released again on Indica Records in 2013. The album was produced by Gus Van Go, giving the sound a crisper, more modern electro-punk-pop-rock sound. Singles \"New Love\", \"Electric\" and \"L'ettre D'Amour\" each reached the top 15 French-Canadian Commercial Alternative Radio BDS charts. New Love was primarily recorded in English with alternate French language versions for \"Electric\" and \"L'ettre D'Amour\".  On February 17, 2015, New Love was digitally released in the US, marking the first time Cafeine's music received domestic distribution in a territory outside of Canada. The USA album cover art was changed from a photo of Cafeine to a blown out photo of a headless angel. A cover version of The Gun Club's song Sex Beat was included as a bonus track. As a live performer, Cafeine is known for his high-octane-punk intensity. Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec quoted \"he is still a beast on stage\" referencing Toronto's alternative weekly NOW Magazine who declared \"Cafeine is amazing, what a beast on stage\". Established as a beloved personality, Cafeine regularly makes live appearances on French-Canadian music television such as Radio-Canada Television's show Stereopop or MusiquePlus specials such as Pop de jam. In 2007, Belgian singer Plastic Bertrand contacted him to collaborate on the writing and composing of his new album \"Dandy Bandit\". Together they wrote seven songs. The two remain good friends, periodically performing together live as recently as June 24, 2015 in Montreal for the annual St. Jean Baptiste holiday. The free outdoor concert was attended by over 15,000 people in the streets of the Villeray area of Montreal and presented by La fete national dans Villeray 2015. Other producer & songwriting collaborations include two albums for French-Canadian punk band Gazoline, \"Futurbabymama\" (2012) and their self-titled album Gazoline (2014)."

He left school in 1983 and signed for Oldham Athletic, establishing himself as a regular midfielder in the later part of the 1980s and helping them reach the FA Cup semi-final and Football League Cup final (which they lost to Nottingham Forest) in the 1989\u201390. After the end of the season, he signed for Everton in a \u00a31million deal, but the move was not a success and after just one season at Goodison Park, Joe Royle bought him back to Oldham, who had just returned to the top flight after a 68-year exile. Milligan resumed his key role in the Oldham side that survived three seasons in the top flight (Premier League from 1992), helping them reach another FA Cup semi final in 1994, before leaving to join Norwich City after Oldham's relegation from the Premier League. He remained at Carrow Road until 2000, when he signed for Blackpool. At Bloomfield Road, he helped Steve McMahon's side win the Division Three playoffs and survive in Division Two before finally retiring in the summer of 2002, aged 35, after a career spanning 19 years. He played once for the Republic of Ireland in 1992, once for the Republic of Ireland U21 and twice for the Republic of Ireland B."

        "content": "After beginning his playing career in Oldham Athletic's youth team on leaving school in 1983, he turned professional in the 1984\u201385 season and made his debut the season after, before becoming a first team regular by the time of his 20th birthday in February 1987. He helped the Latics reach the Football League Cup final in 1989\u201390, where they lost 1\u20130 to Nottingham Forest, as well as reaching the FA Cup semi finals where they held Manchester United to a 3\u20133 draw before losing the replay 2\u20131. However, the Latics were still in the Second Division in 1990 despite having looked like promotion contenders more than once since Milligan's debut five years earlier. When Everton manager Colin Harvey made a \u00a31million bid for him, he accepted the offer and headed to Goodison Park on 24 August 1990. Unfortunately, his time at Everton was not a success as the Toffees endured a terrible start to the season and Harvey was replaced by Howard Kendall as manager in early November 1990. Everton's form improved and they climbed from 18th in early November to ninth in the final table, as well as reaching the FA Cup quarter-finals and eliminating neighbours Liverpool on the way, but Milligan failed to perform well on the pitch and made 17 appearances, scoring once, during a frustrating league campaign. Meanwhile, Joe Royle had guided Oldham to the Second Division title and ended their 68-year absence from the First Division in 1990\u201391, and he secured Milligan's return to Boundary Park on 17 July 1991 for a club record fee of \u00a3600,000. Milligan carried on where he had left off on his return to Oldham, being a key part of their midfield as they survived three seasons in the top flight and reached an FA Cup semi-final in the 1993\u201394 season, only being denied a Wembley final appearance when a Mark Hughes equaliser for Manchester United held them to a 1\u20131 draw in the first game before they were finally crushed 4\u20131 in the Maine Road replay. Oldham went down from the Premier League at the end of the 1993\u201394 season and Milligan was determined to remain at the top level. His wish was granted on 27 June 1994 when he signed for Norwich City in an \u00a3800,000 deal. Milligan had a fine start to his career at Carrow Road, as Norwich entered the Christmas period just outside the top five and with ambitions of a UEFA Cup place. But they suddenly went into freefall, won only one of their final 20 league games, and plummeted to 20th place and relegation. Manager John Deehan resigned a month before relegation was confirmed, replaced on a caretaker basis by Gary Megson until the job went to Martin O'Neill after the season's end. O'Neill left in December 1995 to take over at Leicester City, with Gary Megson returning for a second brief spell at the helm as the Canaries finished 16th after some early promise. Mike Walker was Norwich's manager from the start of the 1996\u201397 season, and like the previous managers selected Milligan as a regular in central midfield. However, Walker had gone within two years and new manager Bruce Rioch gave Milligan fewer first team chances, as he appeared just twice in the 1998\u201399 season and 11 times in 1999\u20132000. He finally left Norwich in May 2000 after six years with the club, and signed for Blackpool on a free transfer after their relegation to the Third Division. In Milligan's first season at Bloomfield Road, he helped them secure qualification for the Division Three playoffs and they won the final to secure an immediate return to Division Two. After contributing to their survival in the 2001\u201302 season, he retired from playing to call time on a career which had spanned nearly 20 years. At Blackpool he scored once, in a 6\u20130 win over Scunthorpe United."

He was nominated by President Reagan for the office of Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, and confirmed by the US Senate. He would later resign in 1983 over a grand jury investigation of illegal business activities. In 1981 he headed the US delegation to London for Bi-Lateral Technical and Operating Procedures with the UK. Then, in 1982, he led the delegation for review of International Civil Air discussions for the Western Mediterranean, which included North African and Southern European countries. Also that year Helms was named Special Ambassador to deliver thanks to the King of Morocco, and individual recognition awards to each crew member of the two Air Morocco aircraft that flew into Tehran, to recover US hostages. Helms is acknowledged as the \u201cfather\u201d of the National Airspace Systems Plan (NAS Plan). In that effort he personally directed the evaluation of US aviation systems capability, and outlined a concept for air traffic control and attendant scheduling proficiency for aircraft collision avoidance. Helms personally originated the concept to remove mid-air collision avoidance from ground control, and place it into aircraft. His program resulted in TCAS, (Traffic Collision and Avoidance System), initially mandatory for US carriers, and subsequently adopted by international aviation. For this accomplishment Helms was nominated for The Collier Trophy. He also initiated the National Airspace Review, to develop methods and procedures for improved safety and operational efficiency in use of all national airspace. In 1983 Helms was selected by the President to head the US delegation to the United Nations, ICAO emergency convening which followed the downing of Korean Airlines Flight 007 by the Soviet Union. That year he also headed the US delegation to the UK for Bi-Lateral Aviation and Airworthiness technical and operational review in London. In 1984 Helms represented the US at the Trans-European conference on Air Carrier Tariffs in Prague, and later that year chaired the US Team for Air Traffic Control and Technology in Moscow for the US\u2013USSR conference directed to the 21st century. That year he was also selected as recipient of the Smithsonian Institution-residenced Glen L. Gilbert trophy."

In August 2008, Mielitz extended his contract until 2010. His professional debut in the 3. Liga was on 16 August 2008 against Jahn Regensburg.

        "content": "During the 2007\u201308 season, Mielitz appeared twice as an unused substitute for a match against Stuttgart and Bayer Leverkusen. Two seasons later, he made his first appearance with Werder's first team on 3 December 2009 in a Europa League home match against Nacional, filling in for the injured Tim Wiese. Three days later, on 6 December 2009, he debuted in the Bundesliga in a 0\u20130 away draw against 1. FC K\u00f6ln, making a good performance throughout the match and kept his first clean sheet on his debut. In February 2010, Mielitz signed a contract extension, keeping him until 2012. Although he was a third-choice goalkeeper for the 2009\u201310 season, he said he was willing to be patient to fight over a first choice goalkeeper role in the near future. On 30 March 2010, when he made another appearance, starting in goal once again, in a 4\u20132 win over FC N\u00fcrnberg. He suffered a knee injury later in the season. He made a total of three appearances in the 2009\u201310 season. Mielitz remained a third-choice goalkeeper behind Wiese and Christian Vander ahead of the 2010\u201311 season. On 20 October 2010, he made his first appearance in the UEFA Champions League group stage against Twente, coming on for the injured Wiese. Three days later, he started in goal again, making several saves contributing to 4\u20131 away win against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, the club's first of the season. After the match, his performance was praised and he was named Man of the Match. He featured in another Champions League match against Twente on 2 November 2010 which Werder Bremen 2\u20130 lost. After this, Mielitz remained on the substitute bench for the next two months until coming on as a late substitute following Wiese's sending off in a 3\u20131 loss against Bayern Munich on 29 January 2011. He appeared three more matches from 5 February 2011 to 19 February 2011 before Wiese's return from suspension. He remained on the substitute bench for the rest of the 2010\u201311 season. At the end of the season, during which he made the total of 10 appearances for the side, Mielitz signed another contract extension, keeping him until 2013. Ahead of the 2011\u201312 season, Mielitz was promoted to a second\u2013choice goalkeeper behind Wiese, taking Vander's place and demoting him to third-choice. After starting the season on the substitute bench, he made his first appearance on 17 September 2011 coming on as a replacement for Wiese, who had been sent off in the early minutes of the match, and conceding a goal in the second\u2013half from Philipp Wollscheid, in a 1\u20131 draw against 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg. While Wiese served a three-match ban until late October, Mielitz played the next three matches and filled in showing very good performances, including in a win over Hertha BSC on 25 September 2011. On 3 December 2011, he started again after Wiese was given a bereavement leave, and conceded four goals, in a 4\u20131 defeat to Bayern Munich. After suffering short\u2013term injury in January 2012, he was featured in two matches between 17 March 2012 and 24 March 2012 following Wiese's injury. He remained on the substitute bench throughout the 2011\u201312 season and was limited to a total of 7 appearances for the side. Shortly after the end of the season, he signed another contract extension in May 2012 which would keep him until 2014. Ahead of the 2012\u201313 season, Mielitz was expected to be the club's first choice goalkeeper by the club's general manager Klaus Allofs following the departure of Wiese to Hoffenheim. In the LIGA total! Cup 2012, Mielitz was the hero when he made two saves in the penalties shoot-out (one from Bastian Schweinsteiger) in a 4\u20132 win over Bayern Munich to progress through the final which they beat Borussia Dortmund in a penalty shoot-out again the following day. After the match against Bayern Munich, he said YouTube helped him save a penalty from Schweinsteiger. After starting in goal in the opening game of the season against Borussia Dortmund, he kept his first clean sheet, in a 2\u20130 win over Hamburg on 1 September 2012. Throughout the 2012\u201313 season, Mielitz was an ever present goalkeeper for the side, but received criticism from the media and pundits, including Frank Rost for conceding goals and lack of clean sheets, which he kept three times during the season. In response to criticism, Mielitz defended himself, saying: \"I make my cause well!\" and felt he was treated unfairly. During a 1\u20131 draw against 1. FSV Mainz 05 on 30 March 2013, he put out his best performance at Werder Bremen, making a lot of saves, to help the side ease their chance to avoid relegation. In the 2013\u201314 season, Mielitz continued to remain the club's first choice goalkeeper and started well keeping two clean sheets in the first two league matches against Eintracht Braunschweig and Augsburg. He also kept two more clean sheets while remaining first choice goalkeeper. However, as in the previous season, Mielitz continuously conceded goals on a regular basis, leading Kicker to say that he lacked \"charisma, though he seems calm, factual, sometimes a little too pale.\" Following a 3\u20132 loss to 1. FSV Mainz on 24 November 2013, he was dropped as a first choice goalkeeper in favour of Raphael Wolf and was placed on the substitute bench for the rest of the season. In response to this, Mielitz said he was disappointed upon learning that he would remain on the substitute bench. He finished the 2013\u201314 season with 14 appearances. It was confirmed in April 2014 that Mielitz would not be offered a new contract by the club and was expected to leave the club at the end of the season. Although he did not play against Hertha BC, he made his farewell appearance and confirmed his departure from the club. By the time of his departure, Mielitz was not considered a replacement of Tim Wiese by the Werder Bremen supporters, including the club's former goalkeeper Dieter Burdenski."

        "content": "With a lack of first team opportunities at SC Freiburg, Mielitz opted to join Greuther F\u00fcrth on 11 June 2015, signing a two\u2013year contract. Upon joining the club, he was expected by then-manager Stefan Ruthenbeck, who was appointed one day before he signed for them, to fight for the first-choice goalkeeper role. Mielitz made his Greuther F\u00fcrth debut in the opening game of the season, keeping a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 win over Karlsruher SC. After making his debut, he quickly established himself as a first-choice goalkeeper at Greuther F\u00fcrth. After keeping two more clean sheets against VfL Bochum and Eintracht Braunschweig at the end of September, he, however, conceded 10 goals in the next two matches, with a defeat to VfL Bochum. and Freiburg. In the following match against 1860 Munich, Mielitz was able to redeem himself when he kept a clean sheet, in a 1\u20130 win. Throughout the 2015\u201316 season, he remained the first-choice goalkeeper and played every match until he was dropped on the last game of the season in a favour of Mark Flekken against SV Sandhausen. Ahead of the 2016\u201317 season, the club signed three goalkeepers, Bal\u00e1zs Megyeri, Sascha Burchert and Marius Funk, providing more competition for Mielitz. Because of this, Mielitz struggled to regain his role as the club's first-choice goalkeeper in his second season and Megyeri was preferred instead. As a result, Mielitz made no appearances for the side this season and played twice for the reserve side. At the end of the 2016\u201317 season, he was released by the club after being told that they would not extend his contract."

Harrington House was owned by the family until the First World War; Since 1930 Harrington House has been home to the Russian Embassy. The exterior of the house was designed by Decimus Burton, following plans sketched by the Earl. Works were carried under the supervision of Charles James Richardson, who was the surveyor to the Earl's extensive South Kensington estate. Details and the final plans are thought to have been left to Richardson; he did, however, acknowledge the \"great measure\" the Earl was involved in the design. The house's unorthodox architecture was widely criticised, including by Richardson; Lord Harrington, however, thought it to be \"a house without a fault\".

He was one of the most famous Chetniks, and the foremost in Western Povardarie. In Bulgaria he is considered a Bulgarian renegade who switched sides, i.e. (sic) Serboman. After murdering a local Ottoman lord, Sokolovi\u0107 went into the woods with some friends and formed a guerrilla unit which would target Ottomans. He then joined the Bulgarian revolutionary organizations of SMAC and IMRO, and fought throughout the wider Macedonia region. After the Ottomans' suppression of the Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising in 1903, he, like many others, fled to Serbia.

Ali-Aga had cancelled weddings, as the first day of his arrival was to be in his honour only. When Ali-Aga gathered the tax, he took an amount that suited him, and never followed any law. Ali-Aga beat villagers whose gibanica (pastry) was not fat enough. He ordered villages to slay sheep just in order to clear his rifle barrel with the tallow. The villagers had none at their side, so five villages (Stepanci, Prisad, Smilovci, Nikodin, Krstec) secretly conspired to murder Ali-Aga, but no one dared to fulfill the task. Then, Gligor Sokolovi\u0107, aged 25, from a sixth village, accepted it. Sokolovi\u0107, with his friend Tale \u0160ejtan, prepared an ambush on the road of Babun, and waited for several days. One morning the villagers of Stepanci came and told them that Ali-Aga had just turned to collect tax from the farms. Tale climbed a tree and had a full view of the surroundings, while Sokolovi\u0107 went and lay with his gun on the end of the road. As Ali-Aga advanced on his horse, Sokolovi\u0107 carefully aimed and shot, and Ali-Aga fell hard to the ground. His horse screamed and fled towards Prilep, and Sokolovi\u0107 and Tale hurried to disappear into the forest, even though no one had seen them. Prilep was soon alarmed, and an army went into pursuit. Sokolovi\u0107 had returned to the village by the night, and the villagers quietly greeted him for his deed. Forces arrived in Nebregovo and searched through the houses. When they entered Sokolovi\u0107's house, he quietly waited while they found nothing. As soon as the troops had left the village, Sokolovi\u0107 went back to the forest and took his hidden gun, and he began guerrilla warfare in the summer of 1895, and he would never look back on the village life. He gathered a few friends: \u0110or\u0111e Pala\u0161 from Prisad, Riste Todorovi\u0107-\u0160ika from Drenovci, and Koce from Omorani, that would form a band. As they did not want to be far away from home, they moved through the forests of Babun and Nebregovo, and ate what the shepherds had prepared for them in the heights of the village areas. In the fall, when the forests became thinner and the first snow made traces, they were forced to flee the site, and they had heard that in Bulgaria, some kind of committee for the struggle against the Ottoman Empire had been founded. Hungry, and pursued, they joined the Bulgarian revolutionaries, where they would not have much rest."

There was heavy snow, and severe cold; Sokolovi\u0107 had his feet severely frozen, swollen and sore. He managed to Nebregovo. Sokolovi\u0107 was not allowed to see his family, so he went to his friend, Stanko Bogojevi\u0107, in belief that he would not be noticed. The frozen flesh of his feet fell of, and they were healed with grass. The village heard that Sokolovi\u0107 had returned. Stanko, fearing for his family, went to Sokol, Gligor's father, and told him that he could not care for the hajduk any more. Sokol came for his son, and when he saw his wounds in the light, he cried. Sokolovi\u0107 was taken to his father's house and there he healed. When snow fell on Babuna again, he left for the forest again, gathering a small band from old friends. In springtime, there was time for the Turks to collect livestock tax from the shepherds, who tried to hide the animals in caves and the heights, but the Turks searched there too. One day, the begs (honorary title, \"sir\") arrived in Drenovci to a shepherd who told them that there were none left, but the one beg, unbelieving, went into the hut to inspect. The beg was shot in the head, and the others left the premises running \u2013 in the hut was Sokolovi\u0107 and his band."

One day, there came a message that two Turkish merchants from Ohrid would travel through the Babuna to Veles. Sokolovi\u0107 had the knowledge and time to prepare an ambush before Stepanci.

They took his severed nose and eyes with them as a sign of vendetta. Sokolovi\u0107 was at the time in Bulgaria, as part of an Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) detachment of 400\u2013500 soldiers, of which commanders where Sotir Atanasov, Atanas Murdzhev, Dimitar Ganchev and Nikola Pushkarov. Hearing of his father's death, he gathered a band and turned to repay his father, but he only reached Vardar, which was cut off by the Ottoman army. The destroyed bands fled towards Bulgaria and Serbia. Sokolovi\u0107 also needed to depart, and he sent a letter to his brother with a bandit, saying: \"I was on my way to return blood but there were many askeri on the Vardar. I retaliated [for his death], but I have not avenged him.\" He turned towards Kyustendil, but when he reached Gyueshevo, the first village after the Bulgarian border, a group of Bulgarians tried to disarm them, and Sokolovi\u0107 began to fight them. Wounded, he returned to Turkish territory with his 8 fighters in order to reach the Serbian border. In Bu\u0161tranje, an old rebel base, he crossed into Serbia. Naum Markovi\u0107, Jordan Severkovi\u0107, Koce Mrgu\u0161ka, from Drenovac; Ilija Mo\u010dko from Prilep; Josif from Bela Crkva, and Ilija Jovanovi\u0107, did not leave their commander. Worn down, with torn shoes and clothes, smeared in mud, and with long beards, they reported themselves to the Serbian border patrol. The band was taken to Vranje, their weapons were left at the Tabana caf\u00e9, and they were sent to Belgrade, where the Serb Chetnik Movement committee awaited them. At their arrival, they were sent to prison as they were suspected Bulgarian komiti."

Dr. Go\u0111evac quickly contacted the borough manager, and the band was immediately released. In Palilula, at the Dva Pobratima caf\u00e9, owned by a Nikola from Kru\u0161evo, Sokolovi\u0107 found his brother who worked in the Belgrade water system. Dr. Go\u0111evac had not yet visited the Voivode whom he had freed, so he walked the Varo\u0161-kapija (an historical neighbourhood) at noon, and Vasa Jovanovi\u0107 (minister) told him that a group of chetniks had dinner at Razman's a\u0161\u010dinica (traditional restaurant). The baker, Dam\u010de, took Dr. Go\u0111evac in and pointed at where Sokolovi\u0107 sat. At a fat-soiled table sat three chetniks in front of a steaming large bowl with pasulj. Upon noticing Vasa Jovanovi\u0107, the three jumped up, and a puzzled Sokolovi\u0107 gave his hard hand, full of calluses. Sokolovi\u0107 was young, with bright blue eyes, timid in his moves, humble, he seemed to have nothing hajduk (brigand) about him. Only his great stature gave light of enormous power. After he had finished his meal, Vasa Jovanovi\u0107 escorted him to Dr. Go\u0111evac. Dr. Go\u0111evac, who was almost disappointed since the encounter, asked him about the head wound. Sokolovi\u0107 gave an embarrassed smile and replied -\"It's nothing...\", \"Who wounded you?\", -\"We had a fight...\" \u2013 he was suspicious, and avoided long conversations. Dr. Go\u0111evac began healing his wounds; his head wound was a result from a gun stock blow, and though it was not severe, it had been neglected. Little by little, Sokolovi\u0107 began opening himself up, telling the story of his life. When Sokolovi\u0107's wound was healed, he was sent to Stara Bogoslovija (between St. Michael's Cathedral and Kalemegdan, towards Hotel National) where more than 50 fighters stayed. He wintered in Belgrade, and spent his time in the \"Crni konj\" caf\u00e9, where many other displaced Serbs gathered. The Stara Bogoslovija quarter served as a barrack for komiti."

This was after negotiations between the Bulgarian and Serbian committees about a joint Serb-Bulgarian uprising had failed after more than 50 meetings in a period of 4\u20135 months. The Bulgarian students and the Serbian side constantly stressed the need for Serb-Bulgarian brotherhood. After the students had left, it was unearthed that most of these were in fact members of the Bulgarian committee, who sought to find their companions and lead them back to Bulgaria. Three of them were wholly assigned to persuade Gligor Sokolovi\u0107 to return to Bulgaria, but he refused. They also met with Stojan Donski. On 25 April, two bands (\u010deta) of some 20 fighters under voivodes An\u0111elko Aleksi\u0107 and \u0110or\u0111e Cvetkovi\u0107 swore oath in a ceremony of the Serbian Chetnik Committee (Dr. Milorad Go\u0111evac, Vasa Jovanovi\u0107, \u017dika Rafailovi\u0107, Luka \u0106elovi\u0107 and General Jovan Atanackovi\u0107), with prota Nikola Stefanovi\u0107 holding the prayers. The Committee had prepared the formation of the first bands for a number of months. The Chetniks were sent for Pore\u010de, and on 8 May they headed out from Vranje, to Bu\u0161tranje, which was divided between Serbia and Turkey. Vasilije Trbi\u0107, who guided them, told them that the best way was to go through the Kozjak and then down to the Vardar. The two voivodes however, wanted the fastest route, through the Kumanovo plains and then to \u010cetirac. They managed to enter Turkish territory but were subsequently exposed in the plain Albanian and Turkish villages, and the Ottomans closed in on them from all sides, and they decided to stay on the \u0160uplji Kamen, which gave them little defence instead of meeting the army on the plains; in broad daylight, the Ottoman military easily poured bombs over the hill and killed all 24 of the Chetniks."

        "content": "After receiving the news in Belgrade, the Chetnik activity did not stop; four new bands were prepared for crossing the border. Velko Mandarchev, from the Skopje field, became the voivode of a band that moved into Skopska Crna Gora. The more experienced and bold Gligor Sokolovi\u0107 became the voivode of a band that would fight in the Prilep region (Prilepska \u010deta). Rista Cvetkovi\u0107-Su\u0161i\u010dki, a former friend and voivode of Zafirov, was sent for Pore\u010de where Micko Krsti\u0107 impatiently waited for him with the band. Pore\u010de was a source for the rebels; every villager was a martyr and hero, and although Pore\u010de was small, it beat off all attacks, and from it, troops entered all sides, as an effectuation for the struggle. The fourth band was firstly sent to Drimkol, Ohrid, its voivodes being \u0110or\u0111e Cvetkovi\u0107 and Vasilije Trbi\u0107. On the night of 19 July, the four bands crossed the border. They went a secure route which had been put forward by Trbi\u0107 and An\u0111elko. They did not rush, and spent days in Kozjak and villages of the P\u010dinja. They went fast and lightly in the night, and carefully descended towards the Vardar transition. In the village of \u017divinj, in the middle of the junction, they encountered Bulgarian Voivode Bobev; the meeting at first was sudden and unpleasant, but quickly became friendly and festive. Voivode Bobev assured them that he was happy that they would fight together, and took the bands to the village of Lisi\u010dja, where they would cross over the Vardar. Only Sokolovi\u0107 suspected a fraud, but went reluctantly. A sudden Ottoman chase urged them to abandon the route on the river coast of P\u010dinja, and to cross Vardar at one of its confluences, as they had intended at first. On the night of 31 July, in the village of Lisi\u010dja, to no avail, a large Bulgarian ambush waited for Bobev to lead the Serbs to their hands \u2013 to terminate the Serbian Chetnik Movement. In the village of Solpa, they dried their clothes on the warm summer morning, and rested in the boxwood shrubs and ate wet bread. Bobev, who was not allowed to leave them as part of the ambush, was still with them. On the next day, 2 August, the bands crossed through Drenovo, and climbed the \u0160ipo\u010dar mountain in a long line, where they would rest and drink fragrant milk of the Vlachs. For three days they freely stayed in the mountain and watched the horizon, and routinely looked out, and then climbed to the higher Dautica mountain. Sokolovi\u0107, troubled and bothered by Bobev's presence, did not want to go further and took his band towards Babuna. The three bands that stayed, followed by Bobev, descended into Belica. There they found a number of Bulgarian bands, led by Voivode Ban\u010da, who told them to call on Micko, a lord of Pore\u010de. The Serbs awaited him, not sensing a deceit. But Trbi\u0107, who had always sought the background in things, found out from a drunk Bulgarian friend, whom he had been drinking with for an hour, that there was a plot against them. Trbi\u0107 told a villager assistant to report to Micko not to come. After learning this, the band of Trbi\u0107 and \u0110or\u0111e Cvetkovi\u0107 turned to Demir-Hisar. Mandar\u010devi\u0107 and Su\u0161i\u010dki stayed in Belica, ready for betrayal. In the mountain village of Slansko they found yet another Bulgarian band, of Voivode \u0110ur\u010din, who kindly, but with the intent to follow them, sent with them two followers to Cer, in Demir-Hisar. In the meantime, in Belgrade, there was still hope that the Serbs and Bulgarians would work together in Macedonia; however, in Macedonian villages, there began massacres. On the night of 6 August, Bulgarian major Atanas Babata and his band entered the Serbian village of Koko\u0161inje, where they were searching for people that were condemned to death by the Bulgarian Committee. The Bulgarian band demanded that the village priests and teachers renounce their Serbian identity, but they refused, and they massacred over 53 people. A servant of one of the teachers, who had managed to hide, set out to find the band of Jovan Dovezenski, who he had heard was crossing the border. The teacher's servant found another Serbian band, that of Jovan Pe\u0161i\u0107-Strelac, which had learned of the Bulgarian atrocities of Babota, but also of those of Jordan Spasev, who had killed members of the notable Dunkovi\u0107 family on 11 August. The Serbian Chetniks in Pore\u010de and Demir-Hisar, constantly followed by Bulgarians, did not know of the massacres. The hungry and tired band of \u0110or\u0111e Cvetkovi\u0107 arrived at the village of Gornji Divjaci, where they were hosted by the villagers who had brought cheese and rakija. They rested in sheets of sheep skin, and the village children came with bread and listened to their stories. Cvetkovi\u0107, Trbi\u0107 and Stevan \u0106ela rested in the house of the village leader, and ate several meals. In the next morning, Trbi\u0107 walked through the yard and went down some stairs, and saw an Ottoman jandarma whom he shot, who was then buried in the forest. The rest ended and the band assembled and walked the river across the mountain. They arrived at the village of Cer the next day where they also found Bulgarians, and the Bulgarian voivodes Hristo Uzunov and Georgi Sugarev joined their company. In the mountainous village of Mramorac, where Petar Chaulev had set up camp in the forest, Trbi\u0107 band were told that the Bulgarian Committee had prohibited them to go to Drimkol. On the same day, 14 August, the Bulgarians had killed Serbian priest Stavro Krsti\u0107, which the Chetniks later learnt from the villagers. Far from the other bands, without help, tricked and surrounded, the band understood their situation. Chaulev informed them of their disarmament and the Bulgarian Committee's verdict of crime against the Bulgarian organization. They were only shouted at, as they were saved by some ethnic Serb voivodes in the Bulgarian bands: Tase and Dejan from Prisovjan and Cvetko from Jablanica in Debar, who were bound by oath to the Bulgarian Committee, but nevertheless openly defended the Serbian Chetniks, and friends, whom they had wintered together with in Belgrade. They awaited Dame Gruev, the second leader of the Bulgarian Committee after Sarafov, who would arrive from Bitola. Gruev and his escort arrived as village priests on a night. Trbi\u0107 knew Gruev from the Kru\u0161evo Uprising and from an encounter in Serava.  Trbi\u0107 used their acquaintance and memories, reminding Gruev of the common revolutionary fight and his childhood, when Gruev was a cadet of the Society of Saint Sava in Belgrade, and an apprentice in the printing house of Pero Todorovi\u0107, which was called Smiljevo after Gruev's birthplace."

        "content": "Born in Paris in 1916 to a working-class family, Pierre Gascar lived part of his childhood in P\u00e9rigord after his mother was institutionalised. His troubled childhood would later inspire him to write La Graine and Meilleur de la Vie. Returning to Paris after completing high school, he became involved in left wing politics and began to associate with writers. His imprisonment in a German stalag during the Second World War heavily influenced his writing during that period. In Le temps des Morts, Gascar recounts his time spent working as a gravedigger at the Rava-Ruska prison camp in Ukraine, during which time he was conscripted to track down Jews hiding in the area. Gascar became a journalist after the end of the war. In 1953, after winning the Prix Goncourt for Les B\u00eates and Le temps des morts, he decided to devote himself entirely to his literary work. His writing, characterised by an exploration of the relationship between plants, animals and people, began to gain greater appreciation from the general public. He started to write biographies, focusing on personalities in which he recognised parts of himself, such as his thirst for knowledge, his independence and his feelings of restlessness. Among the figures he wrote about were Humboldt, Buffon and Bernard Palissy. Aside from his biographical work, he took to writing studies of nature, taking a poetic and philosophical approach. Major works of this kind include Le pr\u00e9sage, Les sources and Le r\u00e8gne v\u00e9g\u00e9tal. The screenplay of Georges Franju's film Les Yeux sans visage (1960) was in large part written by Gascar. Other works include plays, notably Les pas perdus, picture books and prefaces. After winning the Grand Prix of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, he won the Prix Roger Caillois in 1994. Gascar shared Caillois' fascination with the natural world, while however retaining a firm focus on its relationship with human society. He died in 1997. The majority of his works were published by \u00c9ditions Gallimard."

        "content": "In February 2010, Dutch Eredivisie club PSV Eindhoven signed the Austrian teenage midfielder from Austria K\u00e4rnten on a contract running until 30 June 2012 and was immediately assigned to the second team, Jong PSV. The move materialised after he had been invited to the club's training camp three months prior to the move. In January 2011, Ritzmaier was called up to the first team for the club's training camp. Six months later, he signed a two-year contract extension. Ritzmaier made his PSV debut, coming on as a 74th-minute substitute, in a 3\u20130 win over FC Lisse in the third round of the KNVB Cup. On 30 November 2011, he made his UEFA Europa League debut, coming on as a 77th-minute substitute in a 3\u20130 win over Legia Warsaw to qualify for the knockout stage. Ritzmaier then started the whole game, in a central midfield position, winning 2\u20131 over Rapid Bucure\u0219ti on 16 December 2011. By the end of the 2011\u201312 season, he had made three appearances in all competitions. At the start of the 2012\u201313 season, Ritzmaier played in both legs of the Europa League play\u2013off round against Montenegrin club Zeta, as PSV won 14\u20130 on aggregate to send them through to the group stage. Having spent the first five league matches on the substitute bench, he made his league debut for the club, playing the entire game in a 3\u20130 win over Feyenoord on 23 September 2012. Ritzmaier made four more appearances for the side in the first team before suffering a shoulder injury that kept him out for several months. Despite recovering from his injury, his first team opportunities continued to be limited and he was considered to be loaned out by PSV, but this never happened. He made his next first team appearance on 12 May 2013, his first in seven months, in a 3\u20131 loss against Twente. By the end of the 2012\u201313 season, Ritzmaier had made eight appearances in all competitions. Ritzmaier was then loaned out to SC Cambuur in the summer of the 2013. During his loan spell at SC Cambuur, Ritzmaier signed a contract extension with PSV, keeping him until 2015, and then later signed another contract extension with the club, keeping him until 2018. At the start of the 2014\u201315 season, he played in both legs of the Europa League third round fixture against Austrian club SKN St. P\u00f6lten, winning 4\u20132 on aggregate. However, Ritzmaier found his first team opportunities limited once again, mostly coming from the substitute role. As a result, he was sent to play for the club's second team throughout the 2014\u201315 season. Ritzmaier acknowledged this, saying: \"Of course that is a small setback, but the season is still long and I hope that I will get my chance. And then it is up to me to show what I can do. Play as much as possible, make the minutes and be important to the team.\" Manager Phillip Cocu spoke about Ritzmaier's situation, saying: \"Marcel must and can continue to grow, there is still plenty of room in it.\" This led to speculation about his departure in the January transfer window, but the club convinced him to stay. By the end of the 2014\u201315 season, he had made sixteen appearances in all competitions. Upon returning to PSV after being loaned out for the last two seasons, Ritzmaier spent the rest of the 2017\u201318 season playing for the reserve side. He continued to stay at the club throughout the 2017\u201318 season. It was announced on 3 April 2018 that his contract would not be extended at the end of the 2017\u201318 season. With Georginio Wijnaldum, Memphis Depay, Dries Mertens, Jeremain Lens, Kevin Strootman and Jetro Willems in his team, Ritzmaier's prospects of playing time were diminished."

Having initially become a first team regular, Ritzmaier soon found his playing time, mostly coming from the substitute bench. Until the end of the 2015\u201316 season, he went on to make 23 appearances and scoring two times in all competitions. Following this, Ritzmaier returned to PSV. Having been linked a move away from PSV, Ritzmaier was loaned out to Go Ahead Eagles for the 2016\u201317 season. He made his Go Ahead Eagles debut, playing the whole game, in a 3\u20130 loss to Ajax on 28 August 2016. Since making his debut for the club, Ritzmaier quickly became a first team regular for Go Ahead Eagles, where he rotated in playing in the midfield and left\u2013back positions. On 11 February 2017, Ritzmaier scored his first goal for the club, in a 3\u20131 win over ADO Den Haag. However, he suffered an arm injury during a 3\u20131 loss to PSV on 11 March 2017 and was sidelined for weeks. Ritzmaier returned to the starting line\u2013up against Twente on 2 April 2017 and scored his second goal for the club as well as setting up the club's first goal of the game, in a 2\u20131 win. However, he received a straight red card in the 80th minute, losing 4\u20130 to Ajax, resulting in Go Ahead Eagles' relegation to Eerste Divisie and missed the last game of the season. Despite missing three matches by the end of the 2016\u201317 season, Ritzmaier made thirty appearances and scored two times in all competitions."

At a young age, Hong learned to sing and play violin. He first performed at Taihoku City Public Auditorium as part of a children's group, and later as a singer of Japanese patriotic songs. Inspired by Haruo Oka, Hong quit his job at a lumber mill to become a singer, writing his first song, Butterfly in Love with a Flower (), aged 19 in 1946 under the stage name Hong Wen-chang (). He led a group of singers that performed frequently near the Danshui River until the February 28 Incident forced Hong to move to Tainan. Hong began singing on the radio in 1948, alongside  and others. His radio performances drove his popularity, and, in 1957, he released his debut album A Handsome Young Man on a Hilltop (), under his best known stage name Ang It-hong, which was suggested by a fortune teller. His first album featured Hokkien lyrics set to Japanese melodies. Most of his works are songs in Hokkien. Ang's music frequently fused enka with jazz. He worked closely with lyricist  on songs such as Memories of an Old Love () and The One Adored (). Ang appeared in the 1962 film Love Never Ceases, which featured the song Memories of an Old Love and several others written by Ang, which appeared on his second album Endless Love, featuring original melodies. Ang spent the late 1960s and 1970s in Japan, as Kuomintang authorities censored Hokkien pop and other media. As restrictions against Hokkien media were lifted in the 1980s, and martial law was suspended, one of Ang's students, Jody Chiang, rose to stardom. Ang also wrote songs for his son Chris. By the time of his death, Ang had over 200 compositions to his name. Ang died from pancreatic cancer on 24 February 2010 at Taipei Medical University Hospital. His funeral was held on 13 March. He was posthumously awarded a Golden Melody Award for Special Contributions in June 2010. A virtual museum was set up in April 2011 to memorialize Ang's life and career. Ang's three sons produced and released a musical documentary about their father later that year."

D\u00edaz Bess\u00f3n was born in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares and became maestro de capilla of the Royal Convent of La Encarnaci\u00f3n, Madrid. From 1616 he was capell\u00e1n for Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, 1st Duke of Lerma, the favourite of Philip III of Spain. The Duke maintained a musical establishment in Lerma, Burgos, where the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter was consecrated in 1617. On the accession of Philip IV of Spain in 1621 D\u00edaz Bess\u00f3n was capell\u00e1n at Granada Cathedral, then at C\u00f3rdoba (1624\u20131631), and finally at the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales, Madrid. Dates overlap since he was concurrently maestro de la Real Capilla in Madrid and titular maestro de capilla of various cathedrals. In 1628 he was succeeded as maestro de capilla of the Royal Convent of La Encarnaci\u00f3n in Madrid by Carlos Pati\u00f1o who was then, five years later in 1634, chosen ahead of D\u00edaz Bess\u00f3n to succeed the Flemish-born Mateo Romero as the first Spanish-born maestro of the Flemish chapel (capilla flamenca).

D\u00edaz Bess\u00f3n composed in all the major genres: masses, requiem, motets, psalms, antiphons, hymns, tonos humanos, villancicos. In all more than 700 compositions were recorded, almost all of which were lost in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, as well as writing theoretical works."

In the first stock car race held after World War II, Hall beat Bill France, Sr. to win the inaugural race at Seminole Speedway in the fall of 1945; he was declared the champion of the abbreviated 1945 stock car racing season.

Not long afterward, he was arrested, charged, and convicted for a $40,000 bank robbery that took place near Atlanta; sentenced to six years in prison, Hall was released after three years for good behavior. Hardened by the experience, Hall returned to compete in the newly formed NASCAR Strictly Stock series at North Wilkesboro Speedway in October 1949, finishing sixth; two weeks later  NASCAR Modified race at Tri-City Speedway, Hall suffered a serious accident, leaving him in the hospital for over a month.

She was introduced to Henry when he visited Kassel in 1751 and was married to him on 25 June 1752. Wilhelmina was described as a charming beauty. Wilhelmina and Henry had their own court and lived at Schloss Rheinsberg and Berlin. Wilhelmina had no children with Henry, who was reported to pay more attention to his male friends than to her. The couple separated in 1766 after an alleged affair on Wilhelmina's side. After the separation, she lived at Palais Unter den Linden in Berlin, where she was served by successive members of the von Blumenthal family (Amalia, Charlotte, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Leopoldine) as ladies-in-waiting. The Swedish princess Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp described her at the time of her visit in 1798: She was a tall and handsome lady with a well kept figure, though very thin, and you can still see how remarkably beautiful she was in her youth. Her eyes are big and lively though somewhat protruding, and with a restless look. She is witty and literal, but as a consequence of her age, she sometimes talks of several subjects at the same time. Her manners are regal, and she represents perfectly, and was additionally very polite and toward me very pleasant. She was one of the few members of the royal house to remain in Berlin during the French occupation in 1806. While most of the royal family left, reportedly because of the anti-Napoleonic criticisms they had expressed, and the members of the royal court either followed them or left the capital for their country estates, Wilhelmina remained with Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia and his consort Margravine Elisabeth Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt because of \"their high age\" as well as Princess Augusta of Prussia, who was pregnant at the time."

As part of this tight knit community, from an early age he knew future RPF leaders like Kagame and Kayumba Nyamwasa. Karegeya earned a Bachelor of Law degree from Makerere University in Kampala, the same university attended by many post-colonial African leaders. Like other Tutsi exiles, including RPF founder Fred Rwigyema, Karegeya joined the National Resistance Army (NRA) in Uganda. The NRA had been fighting the Ugandan Bush War. The war was led by Yoweri Museveni who was attempting to overthrow Ugandan president Milton Obote. According to his own account, he was arrested in June 1982 and charged with treason, spending three years in jail. After serving his sentence he rejoined the NRA as a lieutenant in Ugandan military intelligence. He claims the decision to invade Rwanda was made at this time by the Tutsi exiles while Kagame was studying in the United States."

Karegeya stayed behind in Uganda to serve as a liaison between intelligence agencies of Uganda and the RPF. Following the war and the genocide, Karegeya took up a position as head of intelligence for the RPF's new government in Rwanda. From 1994 to 2004, he held the post of Director General, External Intelligence in the Rwandan Defence Forces. During his decade in charge of intelligence, Rwanda was involved in complex fighting both internally and in the eastern Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo). Many Hutu, both Interahamwe (the group most responsible for the genocide) and innocent civilians, were packed into refugee camps on the Zaire-Rwanda border. This led to the creation of a large variety of militia groups being backed by different regional powers in the First and Second Congo War. Karegeya had a large role in coordinating intelligence for these wars and for dissident suppression at home. Karegeya was arrested and served an 18-month sentence for desertion and insubordination. He was stripped of his rank of colonel on 13 July 2006 by a military tribunal and fled the country in 2007. Later, Kagame claimed that Karegeya was in the pay of South African military intelligence. In August 2010, Karegeya told the Ugandan paper, The Observer, that Kagame was a dictator who would not leave power unless he was forced out by war. The same month, he told the BBC that Kagame had ordered a series of political killings."

Reports indicated that he had gone to attend a meeting at the hotel. The circumstances leading to his death remain unknown. The South African police are conducting investigations although the Rwandan opposition party, the Rwanda National Congress (RNC) said in a statement to AFP that \"He was strangled by agents of [Rwandan President Paul] Kagame,\" having previously survived several assassination attempts. Karegeya left behind his wife Leah and three children. Some days after his killing, Paul Kagame, in an apparent reference to Karegeya's murder, said that \"You can't betray Rwanda and not get punished for it [...] Anyone, even those still alive, will reap the consequences. Anyone. It is a matter of time.\". When confronted, Kagame denied responsibility, but added that \"I actually wish Rwanda did it. I really wish it.\" It was reported in the South African press that Karegeya had agreed to dispense with his South African security detail in 2012. The government of South Africa had provided the protection since Karegeya\u2019s arrival in South Africa in 2007. The decision to provide protection was reportedly influenced by assassination attempts against former army chief of staff Kayumba Nyamwasa, another Rwandan exile in South Africa. Karegeya's family has accused South Africa of covering up his murder. In January 2019, a state prosecutor launched an inquest into the assassination. The hope was to issue arrest warrants for the suspects who are believed to have fled back to Rwanda. On 19 January 2019, the Randburg Magistrates Court ruled that it was striking the murder inquest from its rolls as the prosecution had not produced any suspects."

In 1964 he played the flute for the compilation Caymmi Visita Tom, 1964. As a composer, the first of his works to be recorded was the music for De Brincadeira, in collaboration with Edmundo Souto, in the voice of M\u00e1rio Castro Neves in 1967. During this period, he accompanied many jazz musicians, such as Sarah Vaughan. Danilo Caymmi also wrote soundtracks for several TV Globo series and soap operas such as Mulheres de Areia, Corpo e Alma, and Riacho Doce. Danilo Caymmi won third place in TV Globo's Festival Internacional da Can\u00e7\u00e3o (International Song Festival), third edition in 1968 with Andan\u00e7a (written with Edmundo Souto and Paulinho Tapaj\u00f3s). The song became a classic, launching the career of Beth Carvalho and since then recorded many times by different artists. Another of his biggest hits came a year later, \"Casaco Marrom (Bye Bye, Ceci),\" written with Guarabira and Renato Correia (the latter being one of the Golden Boys), with which he won the 1969 festival of Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais and also had several re-recordings. As was the case with Andan\u00e7a, this song served to launch another new star, this time Jovem Guarda music style outfit Trio Esperan\u00e7a vocalist Evinha. In 1977 Caymmi went to Bahia, where he collaborated with Tom & Dito, this time playing brass instruments. A year later, Caymmi borrowed money to record and produce 10 thousand copies of his first independent work and most well known compilation Cheiro Verde. As a solo artist, he has recorded seven albums, interpreting his compositions. In 1983, Danilo joined Jobim's musical group, Banda Nova, a family ensemble featuring Jobim's wife, Ana Lontra Jobim, and his son and daughter, Paulo and Elizabeth, as well as Jacques Morelembaum and his wife, Paula, and Danilo Caymmi and his wife, Simone. In 1999, Caymmi recorded with American jazz musician David Liebman, working from a Jobim songbook. In this jazz and bossa nova collection, Caymmi sang in what is described as a \"rich baritone\". The album, The Unknown Jobim had a limited release in Brazil as Tom Jobim In\u00e9dito (Tom Jobim Unpublished). To commemorate his father's 90th birthday, in 2004, Danilo and his brother Dori and sister Nana recorded a compact disc, titled Para Caymmi de Nana, Dori e Danilo (To Caymmi from Nana, Dori and Danilo), featuring Dorival Caymmi's greatest hits. Ten years later, they recorded another album together, named Caymmi, which was nominated for the 2014 Latin Grammy Award for Best MPB Album."

In his story-telling form, he says, \"There is something wrong with the world and the way that people are controlled by the media, by music, belief systems and by religion.\" He adds, \"This album is ear-friendly, with a pinch of the truth. It's not about the industry. I'm taking it a step further. I'm talking about the faces behind the industry.\" With the two-year break that he took, he started working on his own record label, June/July Productions. The company was founded in 2004 and Tuks now runs his own artist and events management, communications, publishing and music production house. Monopoly was released by his June/July Productions with EMI records. The album won him three awards: Metro FM Music Award (Best Hip Hop Album); Hype magazine Hip Hop Awards for Best Albu and Best Solo Artist."

When his brother Johannes departed for Lyon, young Jan Gotlieb became a pupil of the Haarlem painter Jacob Knijff and stayed painting for him until Knijff left Paris on a commission, whereupon Jan Gotlieb joined his brother in Lyon. Together they then travelled to Italy with two French painters. After 6 months in Rome he joined the Bentvueghels with the nickname Mirtillus. After 2 years in Rome the brothers set off for Padua with the Flemish painter Robbert Duval (1639-1732), where they stayed a year. After that they travelled to Venice, where they stayed two years, attending the funeral of their friend Karel Dujardin. They finally left Italy in 1679 and went north to Hamburg, where they lived until 1684 when Jan Gotlieb went into the service of a German prince.

        "content": "He made his debut for the youth team of Hakoah Vienna (Hebrew for the Force, a Jewish multisports club in Vienna) and moved to the first team, then playing in the Austrian second division. His first match in the first division came in December 1920 with the Hakoah first team, who had just been promoted. He marked his appearance with a goal. However, he continued to play sporadically for the first team, more often used as a reserve. Therefore, he decided to move clubs, and left for FAC, Floridsdorfer AC who had just been relegated to the second division. The objective was for the team to be immediately re-promoted to the first division, and the following season, Floridsdorfer returned to the elite. Drucker was one of the key players for the team, playing almost every game in the victorious 1925\u20131926 season in the first division. During this season, he played twice for the Vienna city team, against Krak\u00f3w in September 1925 and Bratislava in March 1926. He rejoined Hakoah Vienna the following season. In 1926, during a very successful club tour to the United States, he received an offer to play in the ASL, the American Soccer League. He signed for the Brooklyn Wanderers in New York. He played two seasons at the club. In 1928, there was a split with the creation of a rival league  in the ESL. Drucker left to play for the newly created New York Hakoah (also known as the Hakoah All-Stars) where he rejoined his former teammates from Hakoah Vienna. With the club, he won the US Open Cup. Drucker played 136 matches in the ASL. In 1931, Leopold Drucker moved back to his home club, Hakoah Vienna. In July 1932, he won his first cap for the Austria national team in a 4-3 win against Sweden in Stockholm. While the newspapers reported on an excellent performance by Drucker, this was his only international cap, possibly due to the political situation at the time. Drucker was the only Hakoah player to play for the Wunderteam, the name given to the brilliant Austrian national team of the 1920s-1930s. In 1933, he left Hakoah for the 3rd time, and after a brief spell at FAC - rejoined his former coach at Hakoah, and former Austrian international, Vinzenz Dittrich, at Olympique de Marseille. He also played with his former teammate J\u00f3szef Eisenhoffer. During the 1933-34 season, Drucker played 16 matches in the French Championship and played in the final of the Coupe de France, losing 2-1 to FC S\u00e8te. At the end of the season, he left for Malta, which he knew through a tournament with FAC. In the following years, Drucker was a player and coach for Floriana FC, St. George's FC and Melita FC, leading the latter to the 1938/39 Maltese FA Trophy, the greatest honour in the club's history to date. After the outbreak of the Second World War, he moved to Palestine, where he played and coached in Jerusalem. After the war, he moved to New York, where in 1947, he worked for Athletic Club Hakoah."

His mother was Antonietta Pulvirenti De Grazia.

Dalla Torre studied Christian archeology and art history at the Sapienza University of Rome.  He held academic posts at the Pontifical Urban University, where he taught classical Greek and served as its Chief Librarian and Archivist.

In doing so, he joined a select group of approximately 60 professed knights, out of a total of 13,500 knights and dames, and quickly rose through ranks of posts set aside for these knights. In 1994 he was elected Grand Prior of Lombardy and Venice, a position he held until 1999. From 1999 to 2004 he was a member of the Sovereign Council. Dalla Torre was elected Grand Commander of the Order in 2004. Four years later, as Grand Commander, he automatically became the acting head of the order \u2013 Lieutenant ad interim \u2013 when Andrew Bertie, the 78th Grand Master, died on 7 February. As the \"leading Italian member\" of the SMOM, he was viewed as a leading candidate to succeed Bertie, but Matthew Festing was elected the new Grand Master on 11 March. Dalla Torre was elected Grand Prior of Rome on 24 January 2009 and re-elected on 12 February 2015. He held that office until he was elected Lieutenant of the Grand Master and acting head of the SMOM on 29 April 2017, following the resignation of Fra' Matthew Festing as Grand Master three months earlier. In advance of the election of a permanent replacement for Festing, dalla Torre was one of a small number of candidates who had the technical qualifications for the office and was seen as the early favourite. In December 2017, Ludwig Hoffmann-Rumerstein, Grand Commander of the SMOM, acting on his own initiative in what appeared to be an attempt to block dalla Torre's election, asked Pope Francis to abolish the Order's requirement that the Grand Master be of noble ancestry, which would have expanded the number of eligible candidates. Pope Francis rejected his suggestions, and on 2 May 2018 dalla Torre was elected Grand Master."

        "content": "Fifty-seven members of the SMOM were chosen to vote on the nomination of dalla Torre as Grand Master.  Among them were two women, marking the first time in the history of the Order that female members participated in the selection of a new leader.  Upon becoming Grand Master, his full title became \"His Most Eminent Highness Fra' Giacomo dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto, Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, Most Humble Guardian of the Poor of Jesus Christ\".  He took the oath of office on 3 May at Santa Maria del Priorato Church, in the presence of the Council Complete of State who elected him. As a Vatican insider, dalla Torre sought to swiftly repair the Order's relations with the Holy See, according to the Associated Press.  These had been damaged after Festing was requested to resign by Pope Francis in 2017.  The Pope had also stepped in to reinstate the Grand Chancellor, Albrecht von Boeselager, whom Festing dismissed from the Order after the SMOM's charity wing under Boeselager's watch was unintentionally implicated in handing out condoms in Myanmar to prevent the transmission of HIV.  Under dalla Torre's leadership, the Order's conservative bloc was \"eased out\" in favour of the reform-oriented group, and institutional changes were in the process of being rolled out.  This led The Daily Telegraph to describe him as being \"utterly in the hands of\" the progressive German association of the Order. Dalla Torre informed the Order in a letter issued on 10 June 2019 that all of its official liturgical celebrations had to use the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite and not the Extraordinary Form (also known as the Tridentine Mass).  These celebrations include the SMOM's investitures, masses during its pilgrimages, memorial masses, and its solemnities and feasts.  He highlighted how article 3 of Summorum Pontificum (the motu proprio issued by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007 on the use of the Tridentine Mass) grants the Major Superior of religious institutes like the Order of Malta the authority to decide which form of the Mass to be used.  The letter made clear that this directive does not encompass \u2013 nor aims to encroach on \u2013 the \"personal preferences\" of members in their everyday lives outside of the Order.  The diplomatic public affairs and press officer of the SMOM, Marianna Balfour, stressed that dalla Torre's letter was merely a restatement of existing principles, not the creation of new guidelines, and was \"aimed only at fostering unity in the Order\". During his tenure as Grand Master, dalla Torre made state visits to countries such as Benin (January 2019), Cameroon (July 2019), Germany, Slovenia, and Bulgaria.  On each of those occasions, he paid a visit to the healthcare facilities run by the SMOM, where he staff and patients.  In September 2019, he expressed his interest in visiting Russia should he be given the opportunity to by the Grand Chancellor, given the Order's historical relations with the country; Paul I of Russia was his predecessor, serving as the de facto 72nd Grand Master from 1799 until 1801.  Dalla Torre was also personally involved with many of the Order's charitable works for the sick and the poor.  He served food to the homeless at Termini and Tiburtina train stations on a weekly basis.  He also participated in the SMOM's pilgrimages to Lourdes, Loreto, and Assisi, as well as its international summer camps for disabled youths. In his last official action as Grand Master, dalla Torre met with the Sovereign Council on 2 April 2020.  They agreed to convene an extraordinary General Chapter in November 2020 to approve the reform of the SMOM Constitution of 1961.  Dalla Torre issued a letter to that effect on 28 April."

He had been receiving treatment for throat cancer in the months leading up to his death. Pope Francis praised him as \"a zealous man of culture and faith\" who embodied \"a spirit of service for the good of the Church [and] dedication to the most suffering\". The Minister for European and Foreign Affairs of Malta, Evarist Bartolo, also expressed his condolences on behalf of the government of Malta. His funeral Mass took place on 5 May at Santa Maria del Priorato Church, presided over by Giovanni Angelo Becciu. He was buried in the crypt of that church next to two of his predecessors, Angelo de Mojana di Cologna and Andrew Bertie. Although the election of a new leader usually takes place within three months after the death or resignation of a Grand Master, the Order confirmed that the election would probably be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Grand Commander Ruy Gon\u00e7alo do Valle Peixoto de Villas Boas served as the interim leader of the SMOM until the election."

His father was an editor of sports writing for the failed New York newspaper Morning Journal. Banks was married twice. His first wife was a secretary who left him after his drug use and his short stint in the hospital due to pneumonia. Banks said that she was constantly nagging him to settle down. Banks' second wife was a show girl, but the marriage quickly dissolved again due to the difference in salary. Banks earned around $40 a week and his wife $1000 a week. It was shortly after this that he was employed at the record store where an infamous incident changed his life. He died May 2, 2013.  Banks had a dream to become an actor, which was not fulfilled to his liking."

He charged in and managed to get the part of a gangster in the movie Greenwich Village Story and the Broadway play Two by Saroyan. When he failed to achieve any star roles, Banks decided to start with a singing career. He studied under the tutelage of Alan Greene along with Harry Belafonte. When Banks failed to make it big-time, he moved on to his third career as a director of plays. He started his first studio and held auditions. One of his memories was of a girl singing. \"She's terrible\", he commented, not knowing that this girl was Barbra Streisand. He also ran through many small jobs such as salad-maker, dishwasher, short-order cook, and theater usher. Finally his string of jobs ended when he tried to be a salesman at a Colony record shop. His simple and short statement on the incident that changed his life was, \"I had a fight and lost.\" While the original argument was trivial, Banks exploded and while he was obviously the smaller opponent, he fought ferociously. In the end, it took six policemen to drag him away from the fight. Banks then studied karate under John Slocum. After 10 lessons, his drug and alcohol use ceased. He trained under multiple teachers and learned many different techniques. Within four years, Banks earned his black belt in Goju Ryu."

This television show was unprecedented and brought the martial arts to public attention. The show toured the world playing in packed houses. Near its peak, the show sold out twice in one day at the 20,000 seat arena in Madison Square Garden. Banks' first show premiered in 1966 and featured many of the best martial artist on the East Coast. The show sold out the Town Hall's 1700 seats in Manhattan, New York. Though there was public suspicion, Bank's show grew until he believed that it was time to approach Madison Square Garden. When Banks met with the vice president of Madison Square in 1972, Banks was so confident he let the Garden have a signed bond guaranteeing them a certain amount of money. In fact, he volunteered to sign anything they wanted. Starting with the Felt Forum, Banks quickly graduated to the main arena within 2 years. Many new artists gained notoriety through Aaron Banks such as Chuck Norris who achieved some of his first major exposure in the Oriental World of Self Defense's competitions held monthly. Lou Neglia, a Karate Hall Famer and name fighter of the year in 1984,{ admits to owing much of his success to Banks due his start fighting in the Oriental World of Self Defense and the World Karate Championships. At age 82, Banks still puts on scaled-down versions of his show, which play to significantly smaller crowds at a local theater in New York."

It is across all sectors and it is people who are typically mentally unstable who are committing a lot of the crimes that we're seeing.\" When reports emerged that Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson's office had ordered a $31,000 dining room table set with taxpayer funds, Tenney blamed the \"deep state\" for the expenditure, adding, \"I know that Ben Carson did not order that table. It has nothing to do with him.

After the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, she said she still planned to support the bill. In November 2017, Tenney introduced the No Pensions for Corrupt Politicians Act, which would \"close a loophole that has allowed corrupt members of Congress to collect federal pensions after they are convicted of crimes.\" In April 2018, Tenney signed a letter calling for criminal investigations into a number of former Obama administration officials and high-ranking Justice Department officials. The letter accused former FBI Director James Comey of leaking classified information, 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton of concealing payments for the Steele Dossier, and Loretta Lynch of threatening whistle-blowers who had anti-Clinton information. The letter also accused former acting attorney general Sally Yates, former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, former acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente, former senior counterintelligence official Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page of criminal wrongdoing. Tenney was a member of the Climate Solutions Caucus. In 2016, she cast doubt on the scientific consensus on climate change, saying, \"The science is not determined. It\u2019s not certain.\" In 2017, she supported President Trump's decision to leave the Paris Agreement. In March 2021, along with all other Senate and House Republicans, she voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. At a January 5, 2021 rally in Georgia, President Donald Trump falsely claimed the votes in Tenney's race against Anthony Brindisi were being counted fraudulently (at the time, the Tenney-Brindisi race was the nation's only uncalled 2020 congressional race). Tenney shared a video of Trump's speech and did not challenge or dispute Trump's claims. In February 2021, following the U.S. Capitol attack, Tenney said she did not know whether she would have voted to count the electoral votes from the states Biden won in 2020, but that she would have voted against Trump's second impeachment. In May 2021, Tenney falsely suggested that the 2020 presidential election might have been \"stolen\"; there is no evidence of any meaningful fraud in the election."

In 1667 he moved to Venice, where he made a series of ten aquatints from works by Giuseppe Diamantini (1621\u20131705). In 1675 he painted the Martyrdom of St. Erasmus. The painting was exhibited at Palazzo Molin, and is currently located in the National Gallery of Spinola in Genoa. In 1690 he was invited to Vienna by the Emperor Leopold I. In 1696 he returned to Valsolda where he frescoed what is considered his masterwork: the nave of the parish church of San Martino. The work, completed the year of the birth of Tiepolo, who would master the art of the luminous fresco, astounds with the use of bright colors and swirling sotto in su perspective as a fresco technique. Michela Catalano, in an entry about Pagani on the Lombardia Beni Culturali website, states:The result is an extraordinary invention of illusionistic perspective, consisting of two quadratura domes connected by transverse arches, framing a complex composition, in which different iconographic themes, in turn, connect the (painted narratives) of lives of the saints to their respective side chapels. (In the center of the second dome) is depicted the Assumption of the Virgin... (To its side, is depicted) .. the Preaching of (John) the Baptist; on the opposite side of the vault, and above the chapel dedicated to Saint Apollonia, Catherine and Lucy, (the space is) decorated with frescoes the death sentence of the three martyrs, carried to glory by angels on the ceiling of the first span. The fantastic, dizzying rush of the vault ... is a veritable compendium of the experiences drawn from the figurative painters in Venice and Central Europe, from research on chiaroscuro and naturalistic styles of the Venetian tenebrosi artists, and impacted by the Baroque of Rubens, a reflection on models of Michelangelo, Tintoretto and other mannerists, supplemented by a precocious adoption of the illusionistic perspective methods of Andrea Pozzo. Pagani died in Milan on 5 May 1716. His former house in Valsolda has been converted in a museum dedicated to his work in 2004."

One of his career's milestones was the job offered to him by Slobodan Suboti\u0107 as his assistant of EuroLeague team Olympiacos for the 2001\u201302 season, where they celebrated the Greek Cup and reached the finals of the Greek League and the last 16 of the EuroLeague. The next season he again worked with Missas at Panionios. In 2004 he was the head coach of the B league team Papagos. In 2006 he was the assistant coach of Kalafatakis at the A1 team Panellinios. That season the team finished fifth and secured a place in the ULEB Cup. Between 2008 and 2010, he was the head coach of the women's club Athinaikos. With the team, he became the Greek champion, finishing two seasons without losing any games, putting the biggest base for breaking the world record of 105 wins in a row. In 2010, Athinaikos won the triple crown (Greek Championship, Greek Cup and Eurocup). During the season, he also became the head coach of the Latvia women's basketball team. In January 2011, Dikeoulakos accepted the offer from the Polish EuroLeague team Lotos Gdynia, with whom he won the Polish Cup. In May 2011 he moved to Turkey and signed with Fenerbah\u00e7e Istanbul. With the team, he won the Turkish championship and reached the EuroLeague Final 4 for the first time in the history of the club. Although it was a successful season, at the end of the season he left. In June 2012 he accepted the two-year contract from the Romanian team CSM T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte. In January 2013, the club announced that Dikeoulakos was sacked although the team was ranked first in the Romanian League and already secured the EuroLeague playoffs. The reason for that conflict was that the club was forcing the coach and the players to accept a salary reduction. In the meantime he was leading the Greece women's national team, when in November 2013 he accepted the offer of the Russian EuroLeague club Nadezhda from Orenburg. Under his coaching, the Russian club reached the EuroLeague Final 4 for the first time in their history, and finished in the second place for two consecutive seasons, the best position they ever made. In the first final they beat UMMC Yekaterinburg on the road but they didn't manage to take the championship. In May 2015, he announced that he would leave the club due to personal reasons. A few hours later, the Turkish team Fenerbah\u00e7e announced Dikeoulakos as their new head coach. In Fenerbah\u00e7e he stayed for two years and the result of this cooperation was one championship, one cup, one super cup and two participations in the EuroLeague Final 4. In June 2017, he returned to Poland and signed for the EuroLeague team CCC Polkowice. In May 2018 he moved to China and joined Shanxi Xing Rui. The 2019\u201320 season found him back at Nadezhda Orenburg. They were stabilized in the third place of the Russian League, and also finished third in their group in EuroLeague. In the play-off games and the entry to the EuroLeague Final 4 they played against Lyon in France on 11 March 2020, and won 80\u201378. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the remainder of the 2019\u201320 season was cancelled. In June 2021, the Italian team Famila Schio announced Dikeoulakos as their new head coach for the next three years."

The oldest known preserved Etrich Taube, in Vienna, Austria, is possibly a near-twin to the aircraft Gavotti flew in 1911, as both are said to have been powered with inline four-cylinder liquid-cooled powerplants. After this and further missions, the Ottoman Empire issued a protest. The dropping of bombs from balloons had been outlawed by the Hague Convention of 1899, but Italy argued that this ban did not extend to heavier-than-air craft."

Her 1888 cookery book included a recipe for \"cornets with cream\", possibly the earliest publication of the edible ice cream cone. She also gave public lectures on cooking, and ran an agency for domestic staff. She was granted a patent in 1885 for an improved ice cream machine that could freeze a pint of ice cream in five minutes. She also suggested using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream, a method Heston Blumenthal uses today in his three-star Michelin restaurant The Fat Duck. With her husband, she established the Marshall School of Cookery in Mortimer Street, central London, in 1883, and published a weekly magazine, The Table, from 1886. The couple also sold cooking utensils and equipment."

Trefall was one of the founders of Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring (FMI) in 1987. For the 1989 parliamentary election, he headed the list of the Stop Immigration party in Hordaland.

He considered the new ethnic groups to be a threat to Norwegian homogeneity, and believed that it would be devastating for the country in the long run. His solution for helping those in need, was to support them in local refugee camps, rather than letting them come to Norway. Although he stated that all humans were of equal worth, he voiced support for nativism, arguing that each country's native citizens should be given special preferential rights in relation to migrants and refugees. He was also opposed to the European Economic Community (later the European Union), which he believed would eventually collapse like the Soviet Union. He thought that the principle of open borders would destroy the common fellowship and good camaraderie between countries. In 2001 he argued that the demand voiced by Lars Sponheim for increased work-based immigration to Norway was evocative of the \"slave-owner ideology\" of former colonial societies, such as the slaveholding United States. In addition, he held that Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland expressed racist attitudes when he promoted immigration to Norway in order to make immigrants take the \"dirty jobs\" Norwegians would not accept. He maintained that the immigrants in turn would become just as selective as the Norwegians, which in turn would require a corresponding increase of immigration."

He was born in Watford, Hertfordshire. Hahn made his debut for Oxfordshire in the 1964 Minor Counties Championship against Dorset.  Hahn played Minor counties cricket for Oxfordshire from 1964 to 1972 which included 34 Minor Counties Championship matches.  He made his List A debut against Worcestershire in the 1970 Gillette Cup.  In this match he scored 25 runs before being run out.  He played a further List A match against Durham in the 1972 Gillette Cup.  In his second match, he scored 3 runs before being dismissed by Stuart Young. Stan Hahn was also a very fine table tennis player who represented both Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire.  He was the leading player in Oxford in 1965, 1967, 1971 to 1974 and again in 1976 and 1977.  Hahn also forged a formidable doubles partnership, and won many titles, with his long-time team-mate, David Harse (\"Harry\"). Hahn had a fine all-round game and could defend away from the table with the best of them.  However, he was probably happiest when deploying his imaginatively varied, unerringly consistent and pitilessly accurate loops to put his opponents on the defensive.  As well as his dominating forehand loop, he was among the first practitioners of the backhand loop, probably the hardest shot in the game.  His matchless powers of concentration meant that, although his style demanded the greatest precision, he seldom missed. Though his competitive drive sometimes spilled over into unnerving displays of fury, he played the game fairly and he encouraged many youngsters, who found him to be an approachable and inspiring champion of the game. He died in Oxford, Oxfordshire on 28 January 1991."

His father, a machinist, was born in Cork, Ireland and moved to the United States in March 1923. He worked at the Reed Unit Fan Company in New Orleans. Toye says his father was an abusive alcoholic. Toye was a poor student and dropped out of high school. At the age of 17, he moved to New York City and worked at the Metropolitan Opera one summer. In 1951, he moved back to New Orleans, where he went to work for engineering firms making architectural models. In his spare time, he studied art books and taught himself to paint. Later, in the 1960s, he worked as an artist. Hunter met his wife, the former Beryl Spalding, from London, when she visited New Orleans in 1967. In 1969, according to a newspaper article and police reports, the Toyes reported a burglary at their home, in which 50 paintings, some of local politicians and others of Storyville, a red-light district, were slashed or stolen. Toye told police that most of the destroyed work satirized local politicians, and that he was to exhibit the Storyville paintings in less than two weeks. Toye claims the burglary was a vendetta by politicians who did not like his portrayal of them. He and his wife say they filed an insurance claim for the damaged art and were paid about $25,000. Toye claims to have invented an internal combustion turbine. A 1972 patent in the name of William J. Toye does exist at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Between 1967 and 2000, Toye and his wife set up several corporations in Louisiana, including two flood-control companies, a funding company, and two building companies."

The auction's catalogue listed the paintings' owner as Dr. W. Geoffrey Toye, an alias Toye used in the 1990s, claiming his own name was too close to his father's. (The name Geoffrey was chosen after the English conductor and composer Geoffrey Toye, whom Toye says is a relative.) Experts later identified numerous paintings in the auction, including Toye's, as forgeries. The auction was halted after New York art dealers questioned most of the other 126 paintings scheduled for auction and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened an inquiry. No charges were filed against Toye. In September 2009, the FBI raided the Toyes home as part of their investigation of reports of forgery of Hunter's works. The FBI said the Toyes and Lucky \u201cengaged in a conspiracy and a scheme to defraud several victims [in] Louisiana and in other states\u00a0... [and] knowingly sold forgeries as original, authentic works of art by Clementine Hunter.\u201d Toye and his wife were indicted for fraud in February 2010 in a conspiracy to sell counterfeit Hunter paintings with New Orleans antique dealer Robert E. Lucky, Jr. Prosecutors said Toye created phony bills of sale, and appraisals to establish the provenance he and his wife claimed, that she had bought the paintings from Hunter in the 1960s and 1970s. Some paintings, returned to Lucky by buyers who suspected they were fakes, were resold to other buyers. Toye pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy to defraud collectors, to fraud in misrepresenting the painting's authenticity and origin, and to art forgery. By pleading guilty, Toye avoided serving a maximum of five years in prison. On his way out of the courthouse, Toye, 79, was photographed twice attacking a news photographer with his cane. On September 7, 2011, William and Beryl Toye pleaded guilty to mail fraud charges and were sentenced to two-years probation and ordered to pay $426,393 in restitution to the victims of the fraud. Robert Lucky was also convicted of mail fraud in January 2012 and was sentenced to 25 months in prison and a restitution of $326,893. An additional three-year supervised release period and 200 hours of community service is to follow Lucky's incarceration."

        "content": "Kamal Abbas (; born in 1955) is General Coordinator of the Center for Trade Unions and Workers Services (CTUWS), an activist group for independent unions in Egypt. Involved in activism for over 20 years, Abbas has been active in mobilizing worker support during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 and its aftermath.  His approach emphasizes peaceful strikes and rallies accompanied by demands for better wages and working conditions, as well as more regular elections for union officials, and an independent union system. He began his work by organizing a strike at a steel plant in Helwan, Egypt in 1989, for which he was arrested, tortured, and fired.  That incident led to his starting the CTUWS and advocating for workers' rights throughout Egypt.  Abbas' relationship with Mubarak's regime was tense and marked by conflicts with the government and multiple arrests. The Los Angeles Times called Abbas \"a major annoyance\" to President Hosni Mubarak's regime, and \"passionate, methodical and accustomed to police surveillance.\" In 2007, Abbas was charged with defamation and sentenced to one year of prison.  There was international condemnation of the ruling, with major labor and human rights groups defending Abbas.  In February 2012 he was once again sentenced to a prison term, this time six months for \"insulting\" a public official. Abbas' work gained momentum and attention during the 2011 Egyptian revolution, where he helped mobilize workers in the nationwide movement for civil rights and the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak's regime."

        "content": "Abbas began working in a steel mill in 1975 at the age of 20. While under the Mubarak regime, Abbas began organizing workers, despite unions being dominated by the state-approved Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF). In 1989 he participated in a strike at the Iron and Steel Company plant in Helwan where 19,000 workers sought wage increases and a meal during work.  They were met by 10,000 riot police who fired rubber bullets and tear gas at the striking workers; ultimately the strike was broken up when security forces stormed the plant, resulting on one death, one hundred injuries and hundreds of arrests. Abbas was arrested four times in the subsequent months, including 45 days of detention in which he was tortured. Following, he was terminated for participating in an \"illegal\" strike not sanctioned by the official trade union. Several months later in 1990, Abbas co-founded CTUWS in Helwan to support workers and address the lack of independent unions in the private sector.  He was guided by the advice of Yusuf Darwish, a long-time communist and labor lawyer, with whom Abbas had previously led the People's Socialist Party.  Abbas had studied world labor movements, looking up to the power of unions in Europe and the Solidarity movement in Poland in the 1980s. Abbas changed his ideological focus from his early ties to Marxist politics, instead focusing CTUWS on practical reform."

        "content": "Abbas' relationship with Mubarak's regime was tense and marked by conflicts with the government and multiple arrests. In 1998 Abbas commented on the July strikes at the Egypt-Helwan Textiles Factory and the Nasr Pharmaceutical plant.  Abbas saw the incidents as a test of the future of privatisation.  He said, \"People can now see that there is a choice, that they can say no.\" In 1999 he spoke out on the need for education and training for workers.  He said, \"In Korea, development was based on a comprehensive educational policy. We still do not see this happening here. Even in the new factories, production lines are imported with a foreign expert to run them. They are assembly plants and the Egyptian worker does not have to be very skilled. The Egyptian worker does not gain the kind of knowledge that can make him an interactive part of the production process.\" In the 2000 Parliamentary elections, Abbas nominated himself as an independent labor representative for Helwan. Abbas said that his General Union for Mineral, Electrical, and Engineering Industries at first refused to grant him status as a labor representative. According to Abbas, he received it, \"Following a long and exhausting struggle with the general union council.\" He also criticized the candidacy of Minister Sayed Mash'al and supported Safir Nigm for minister of military production in the Helwan area.  Abbas argued, \"After Mash'al took over, there was a massive explosion at one of the factories. Five workers died and compensation was inadequate. When workers complained, [Mash'al] had dozens of them sent to jail.\" In 2001 Abbas commented on the increasing privatisation of employment and the role of professional committees. He said, \"Approximately 50 per cent of the number of trade union members who make up the current trade union structure belong to and vote for 'professional committees.'\" Drivers in the Helwan district, Abbas said, are members of a professional committee, as are the construction workers in Shubra. \"These are committees that have few functions. For example, a driver will only go to his union when getting his licence because he needs their signature. We cannot consider these committees or their members active components of the trade union structure or the working class.\" He noted the changing nature of political alliances regarding unions:  \"And this time around, the left has changed its election programme from calling for the protection of the public sector to focusing on the protection of workers' rights, irrespective of who the management is.\" In 2002 a Unified Labour Law came up for parliamentary debate to replace labour law 137, passed in 1981. Abbas criticized exclusions in the bill which left out government administration, domestic work, workers' families, short-term workers (less than six months), principal management, and self-employed workers, and \"pure\" agricultural work when done by women and minors. In 2003 Abbas began seeking formal registration in line with Article 11 of Law 84/2002, which deals with NGO registration, security and public order.  Abbas was critical of the registration procedures:  \"The law is bad and it is designed to co-opt you under government control.  And there has been heavy government pressure.  But we decided to try and open negotiations with them.  After all, in Egypt you never know what is going to happen\u2014things could get even worse tomorrow.\" Abbas fought attempts to exclude the words \"worker\" and \"trade union\" from the organization name or scope.  \"They wanted us to change our name, but we won't, it's internationally recognized.  They said the name breaches Article 11.  We said no, Article 11 has to do with your goals...They said that our work could breach article 11. 'Your problem is that you speak for workers in disputes, and this we can not allow.  There are government agencies and organizations that already do this, and you cannot have face to face meetings [on these issues].'\" In 2005 Abbas was critical of how workers' rights were being addressed in the political dialogue.  He said, \"Unfortunately, the labour movement's democratic demands are absent from the agenda of change called for by the opposition. Even the political parties that are close to workers' circles\u2014such as the Tagammu and Nasserist parties\u2014are only interested now in the laws that regulate political participation and professional syndicates.\"  He told the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, \"Political movements that once upheld the interests of the working class based themselves on public sector workers, most of whom have been liquidated through early retirement schemes...the current environment where workers see people taking on the state and putting up a fight has created a situation in which we can see renewed labour activism of the sort now taking place...I do not think that such a movement would have been possible if it were not for the current movement for political reform.\" In 2005 Abbas criticized the negotiations in the Esco workers' protest. He noted that clause 69 of the labor contract, which stipulated workers could be fired if they fail to perform \"essential duties\", was broad enough to permit random firings. Abbas also criticized requirements that protests be approved by the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU).  He said, \"Workers go on strike to improve their material conditions.  They are not staging a play. They are not rehearsing for some media circus. And they should not be forced to strike within the straitjacket of a preset timetable. This defeats the purpose of the strike because it limits the workers' bargaining power.\" In June 2005 Abbas commented on legal issues dealing with the Al-Amrya Weaving and Textile Company.  He said, \"The distinction between public and private sector workers will in any case become irrelevant, sooner or later, given that the entire public sector is on the block. What is important in this case is that the Unified Labour Law (12) of 2003 doesn't differentiate between private and public sector workers. Misr Al-Amrya cannot legally argue on the basis of state workers' rights to base salary increments versus private sector workers' non-rights. Which is why, in the end, the company did eventually comply.\" In July 2005 Abbas was attacked by plain-clothes Egyptian security forces while demonstrating against human rights abuses by the Mubarak regime.  He was badly wounded. In 2005 Abbas also criticized the Muslim Brotherhood for being two-faced in their approach to civil rights. \"Egypt has never had democracy. For now the Brotherhood stands for civil rights, but its basic stance is against them. It has one language for the media and another for its followers.\" In November 2006 Abbas dismissed the significance of General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU) elections, arguing that public sector industrial workers overseen by the GFTU were increasingly few.  He recommended switching focus to uninionized private sector workers:  \"The minister of investment has openly stated that except for four companies the little that remains of the industrial public sector is for sale...the real battle is to fight for trade union pluralism, to build a new and independent trade union structure.\""

        "title": "Kamal Abbas_2007-2010: CTUWS closure, lawsuit, and prison sentence",
        "content": "In November 2007 Abass criticized the government sale of companies to international investors, arguing the transactions led to workers losing their jobs. In 2007 he criticized the state of politics, calling the regime illegitimate, and saying that Egypt is \"a suffering society with no way to express itself.\" He speculated that poverty in Cairo could lead to a violent confrontation with the police. Abbas envisioned a charismatic opposition leader who could rise up amidst the tension, but he did not believe such an individual would be part of the labor movement.  He said, \"Those who think the labor movement will lead to political change in Egypt are foolish.  The movement is still too young. We have to be concerned with the economic conditions of the workers. We can't rush things.\" In April 2007 Abbas' CTUWS office was shut down and he was accused of working with \"external forces\" in order to disrupt the country's economy.  The government closed CTUWS' Helwan headquarters and two other branches in Nag' Hamadi and Mehala Al-Kobra for \"security reasons\". In September 2007 Abbas and another writer were convicted of defamation and public abuse after writer Mohamed Helmy published an article on corruption at the 15th of May Youth Center, where Abbas was a member of the board. The story was published in Kalam Sanay'iya, a magazine published by the CTUWS.  The lawsuit for alleged \"slander and defamation of character\" against Abbas\u2014and his co-defendant lawyer Mohamed Helmi\u2014was filed by Mohamed Mustafa Ibrahim, chairman of the board of directors at the youth center. Ibrahim filed three petitions against Abbas and claimed that the magazine article \"publicly defamed him as a state-appointed civil servant\". He based his case on Article 188 of the Egyptian code of law, which penalizes false reporting (anyone who \"publishes false news, statements or rumours likely to disturb public order\" may face a prison sentence).  Abbas was sentenced to one year in prison. About the incident, Abbas commented to National Public Radio, \"The government is also very sensitive about any links between political powers in Egypt and the labor movement because this would mean that workers might enter with their weight into the democratic movement. They're very scared of this.\" \"It is clear the judge's decision to give me a one-year jail sentence is political...It is no coincidence that I was sentenced at about the same time as the journalists and editors,\" Abbas told Ahram Weekly. \"The court had regularly adjourned the case since May, deciding to issue a ruling only on 21 September. Prosecuting and sentencing journalists for publishing offences is all part of the government's general crack-down on civil liberties.  The government feels threatened by the strikes, especially actions taken by the militant Mehala Al-Kubra textile workers whose latest strike was settled last week. They need a scapegoat for their failed policies. This is why they closed down our offices, refuse to license us and continue to accuse the CTUWS of inciting the strikes. The allegations are flattering but untrue. How could we possibly have incited the tens of thousands of workers who have gone on strike since December?\" he said. CTUWS criticized the conviction. \"What does it mean when courts seek to imprison citizens, who publish the facts about corruption cases? The allegations against Ibrahim were found to be true and were the basis for the legal decision... Does it mean that the courts are offering immunity to corrupt officials, that they are offering protection against any criticism or disclosure?\" International labor and human rights groups came out in support of Abbas and condemned the court decision. The International Confederation of Trade Unions (ITUC), accused the Mubarak regime of going after opposition groups and media.  \"We are very concerned about this latest attack on the CTUWS.  We are particularly concerned that these prison sentences follow a long tradition of repression of the CTUWS, an independent civil society organization committed to defending trade union and workers rights in Egypt,\" said Guy Ryder, ITUC general secretary. A coalition of the Italian trade unions sent a letter to Mubarak asking him to \"ensure that CTUWS is not persecuted and demanding that \"this particular case could be reviewed.  The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network also issued a statement \"expressing its deep concern over the case. Egyptian labour historian Joel Beinin said, \"The attack on CTUWS is part of the intensification of the assault of the Mubarak regime against its opponents\". Faiza Rady considered the prison sentence an attack on the defence of workers' rights. After Abbas' and Helmy's September conviction, an investigation by the Governor of Cairo found the charges of corruption at the youth center to be true.  Cairo Governor Abdel Azim Wazir ordered the entire board of the center to be disbanded. Abbas appealed his conviction at a 29 Dec. hearing.  He and Helmy remained free between the case and the appeal. In 2009 Human Rights Watch noted a significant increase \"in the harassment of human rights activists at Cairo airport\", which included the detainment of Abbas. In 2010 the Egyptian Minister of Planning created a committee regarding minimum wage, which Abbas criticized for not acting.  Abbas supported working with the new committee's goals, which included a minimum annual salary increase of seven per cent. He also criticized the labour complaints committee for not meeting regularly. In 2010 Abbas criticized proposals to postpone trade union elections.  Abbas criticized the role of the ETUF as \"a governmental institution, not a federation of genuine trade unions. Nor does it represent Egypt's workers in any way.\" Abbas also noted the practice of elected officials busing in members of their constituency to vote. In May 2010 Abbas criticized the forced end of a protest in Cairo by workers from Amonsito, the Egyptian Telephone Company and el-Nubaria Agricultural Engineering, who had been protesting for several months.  Abbas had said he would submit a complaint to the International Labour Organization about the incident. In August 2010 Abbas criticized the constitutionality of military courts being used on civilians working in military production facilities. Also in August Abbas criticized ETUF head Megawer of being an appointed labor representative in positions that are mandated to be elected.  Abbas also criticized Megawer's affiliation with the National Democratic Party (NDP), suggesting that the ETUF should not be determining eligibility for parliamentary elections.  Abbas argued, \"The ETUF has actually granted a number of businessmen and retired officers, from the ruling party, the status of labor representatives when they are not laborers in any way shape or form.\""

        "content": "During the revolution, Abbas made an appeal for new trade unions at Tahrir Square.  He said, \u201cOn January 30th we met with representative of other independent trade union organizations and we discussed forming a new federation.  We then made an announcement in Tahrir square, calling for a new federation. But at the time we had no idea what would happen. Since then this call has been responded to by the workers. The challenge now that the revolution has succeeded is to be able to build a society of social justice.\u201d In February 2011 Abbas criticized the elections in federation syndicates for being corrupt with fraud.  He said, \"There are 116 verdicts of administrative court annulling the last union elections and we believe members of the federation were involved in acts of violence against the protesters in Tahrir\".  Abbas recommended creating independent syndicates, saying, \"We will do as our grandfathers did before 1952 when the first unions were created in Egypt\". Also in February, Abbas supported strikes motivated by \"how many billions the Mubarak family was worth.\" In May 2011 Abbas celebrated International Workers' Day (also known as \"May Day\"), the international socialist commemoration of workers' rights reform begun in the United States.  Abbas deemed that year's celebrations  \"historic\" for marking a break from the ETUF.  Abbas also praised the then newly formed Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions (EITUF).  May Day celebrations focused on the free will of Egyptian workers to form independent trade unions, free from state control, and the dismantling of the ETUF. In June 2011, Abbas was co-filer of a lawsuit calling for the dissolution of the state-controlled ETUF.  The suit called for \"sequestration of the ETUF headquarters, buildings, its Workers' University, cultural institute, hospitals and clinics\" as well as \"barring the ETUF from representing Egypt's workers or unions at international conferences\". Abbas interrupted the ETUF's Ismail Fahmy during his speech at the International Labour Organization (ILO) June 2011 conference.  Abbas criticized the ETUF saying, \"Enough ... all these years ... and crimes enough! ... Enough you killers! ... You participated in the passage of the privatization deals, and facilitated and justified the blatant attacks on the rights of workers ... You defended with impunity Mubarak's regime with its corruption, repression and tyranny, and then you plotted against the killing of the revolutionaries in Tahrir Square!\" During the 2011 revolution Abbas made a video from Tahrir Square telling American workers who were on strike in Wisconsin: \"From this place, I want you to know that we stand with you as you stood with us.  I want you to know that no power can challenge the will of the people when they believe in their rights.  When they raise their voices loud and clear and struggle against exploitation.  No one believed that our revolution could succeed against the strongest dictatorship in the region.  But in 18 days the revolution achieved the victory of the people\u2026.We want you to know that we stand on your side.  Stand firm and don\u2019t waiver.  Don\u2019t give up on your rights.  Victory always belongs to the people who stand firm and demand their just rights.  We and all the people of the world stand on your side and give you our full support.  As our just struggle for freedom, democracy and justice succeeded, your struggle will succeed.  Victory belongs to you when you stand firm and remain steadfast in demanding your just rights.\" In March 2011, Abbas participated in a labour panel discussing the future of trade unions following the fall of Mubarak's regime.  At the end of the panel, Abbas declared, \"the regime has fallen...the Egyptian Federation of Trade Unions has fallen!  What more do you want?  Go create your own unions!\" On 29 February 2012, the CTUWS reported that Abbas had been sentenced in absentia to six months in prison for \"insulting\" a public official."

        "content": "Andrea Ferrante (born 16 August 1968, Palermo, Italy) is an Italian composer whose music is performed throughout Europe, Asia and the Americas and published by Videoradio and Rai Trade Labels, Edizioni Carrara and Edizioni Simeoli. His compositional activity, as shown in the essay Backstage of the creative act, the music psychologist Rosa Alba Gambino, can be divided into two phases: the first (which ends with the composition of the holy La sposa del vento for soloists, chorus and orchestra staged in Palermo in 2000 by Operalaboratorio) in which Andrea Ferrante investigates the Mediterranean sounds of his land through the filter of the contemporary, and the second (after ten years of silence, and in collaboration with his favourite pianist Domenico Piccich\u00e8) in which the mature composer's own language is inspired by multiculturalism and the concept of emotion / enjoyment of music that cast its production outside Europe. His compositional activity ranges from classical music to that for the image, even through recent collaborations in pop music with Giovanna Nocetti and Paolo Limiti (poet and TV presenter) which, exclusively for his music, wrote the lyrics to \"The Man of no\". He teaches at the Conservatorio di Musica di Stato \"Arcangelo Corelli\" in Messina."

The native of Holyoke, Massachusetts, threw and batted left-handed, stood  tall and weighed . Marquis was an outfielder when he signed his first baseball contract with the Orioles on September 2, 1955, and his first professional appearance came at the Major League level 23 days later. On September 25 at Griffith Stadium against the Washington Senators, Marquis replaced fellow Massachusetts-born rookie Angelo Dagres as the Orioles' right fielder in the eighth inning. He had no chances in the field during his one inning of play, then grounded out against Washington's Bob Chakales in the top of the ninth frame.  Veteran Cal Abrams then took Marquis' place as the right fielder in the Baltimore lineup. Sent to the lower reaches of Baltimore's minor league system in both 1956 and 1957 to gain playing experience, Marquis batted only .225 at the Class D level, and was shifted to first baseman and then southpaw pitcher (compiling a 2\u20132 record), before leaving baseball at the end of the 1957 season at the age of 20. He died at 67 in Holyoke in 2004."

Wendelin's grandfather, Johann Wei\u00dfheimer I, from Osthofen, inherited a stone mill from his mother's family at the end of the 18th century. Viticulture, agriculture, animal husbandry and mill grinding were already undertaken on the manor complex in the 19th century. The manor is still owned by the Wei\u00dfheimer family. This complex was one of the most important in the former Grand Duchy of Hesse. Wendelin Wei\u00dfheimer was born at the Stone Mill Winery of Osthofen, the eighth and youngest child of Johann Wei\u00dfheimer II and Ottilie, n\u00e9e Best der Welt. His parents were wealthy and his father, a highly respected and multi-talented man with a keen interest in history and politics, had already been mayor for several years and a member of the first Osthofen Hessian St\u00e4ndekammer, which is why Wendelin met, at a young age, men of the March Revolution of 1848 at the Stone Mill. Despite his commitments as landowner and politician, Wendelin Wei\u00dfheimer's father found time to deal with family and traditional, historical studies, the result of which was his multi-volume chronicle of the Osthofens recorded in handwritten diaries. He allowed Wendelin to study music, although this clearly contradicted his intentions of making Wendelin his estate's heir."

His father had intended him to inherit the Stone Mill, and thus he was sent to a secondary school in Darmstadt when he was only 13 as an apprentice. There, through his piano teacher, a member of the theater orchestra, he had an opportunity to listen to a rehearsal for the performance of Tannhauser. He had heard earlier parts of the music during a visit to a military concert. Wei\u00dfheimer wrote that these experiences influenced him greatly. In his book: Experiences with Richard Wagner, Franz Liszt and many other contemporaries, he wrote: \"An unsuspected new world had risen for me, in fact.\" Soon thereafter, in Darmstadt, Wendelin Wei\u00dfheimer listened to the Lohengrin opera, and in Frankfurt to the Flying Dutchman, putting him into a Wagnerian delirium. In his final year in school Wendelin was introduced to music theory by theater conductor Louis Schindelmeisser. This so captivated him that he soon began to compose. Schindelmeisser was the first to recognize Wendelin's musical talent. He had to persuade Wendellin's father to allow him to pursue his musical intentions. To this end, Schindelmeisser went to the Stone Mill in Osthofen on 16 March 1856. The father's initial astonishment gave way to his approval. On his departure, Schindelmeisser gave young Wei\u00dfheimer a picture dedicated to him as well as one of many original letters written by Richard Wagner."

After completing his studies Wendelin took the post of second conductor at the city theatre in Mainz under Schindelmeisser. Before beginning, he traveled to Zurich to visit Richard Wagner, who was living there in exile. Wagner was working on his musical drama Tristan and Isolde and usually declined to see visitors. Wendelin was first rejected, but eventually spent one memorable afternoon with the master on 17 July 1858.

Lessons were held three to four times a week, for several hours at a time. Wei\u00dfheimer soon became Liszt's favorite student. Here, in Altenburg, Weimar, home of Liszt's close friend Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein of Sayn-Wittgenstein, Wei\u00dfheimer was introduced to a new musical world. While here he met his friend, Peter Cornelius, who had also come to Weimar in 1860, and was introduced to Felix Draeseke, Hans von Bronsart, Carl Tausig, the Bohemian Smetana, Franz Bendel, Gru\u00e8re and Hans von B\u00fclow among other notables. In Weimar, one of Wei\u00dfheimer's compositions was first performed by an orchestra. Liszt included Wei\u00dfheimer's symphony on Schiller's Ritter Toggenburg on the program for the court concerts that he conducted on 13 March 1860. To allow Wei\u00dfheimer to take part in this concert at the Grand Ducal Palace, which was only accessible to the court and nobility, Liszt had him wear a tail coat and a white tie and placed him in the middle of the string orchestra, where he had to pretend to play the violin. At the end of the concert, the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess expressed approval of the composer. The next day on his visit to Liszt, Wei\u00dfheimer met daughter Cosima, who was married for two years to von B\u00fclow and who would later become Wagner's second wife. Wei\u00dfheimer's stay in Weimar climaxed in 1861. He presented a musical meeting starting with Liszt's Faust Symphony under B\u00fclow's baton. Wei\u00dfheimer achieved complete success with the presentation of his Grave in Busento by the court orchestra and the academic choir of Jena students. Wagner made an unexpected appearance at this event, after eleven years of exile in Switzerland."

        "content": "In the autumn of 1861 Wei\u00dfheimer returned to the Mainz theatre as music director. During this period he befriended Wagner. After the Weimar meeting, Wagner tried unsuccessfully to reach Paris in late November where Prince Metternich had provided him with a garden apartment at the Austrian Embassy. On 1 December, he arrived unexpectedly in Mainz to negotiate his stage festival play Die Meistersinger von Nuernberg with the Schott publishing house. He already had the text and the poetic process was to take place in Paris. During the days in Mainz, Wagner attended the opera performances conducted by Wei\u00dfheimer and Wei\u00dfheimer also participated in his meetings with Mrs. Betty Schott. After successfully completing his Meistersinger poetry in less than two months in Paris, Wagner returned to Mainz on 31 January 1862. That same evening, in the Schotts' house, before a selected circle of listeners, Wagner presented the Meistersingers poetry. Peter Cornelius and Wei\u00dfheimer were present. Wei\u00dfheimer writes about this memorable night that \"Wagner carried away with the audience and caused them to rally tumultuously. At the end of the play the audience was aware that they stood at the cradle of a mighty work of art.\" In order to be able to complete the composition without uninterruption, Wagner rented a small apartment in nearby Biebrich, just below the ducal castle on the Rhine. As a result, Wei\u00dfheimer and Wagner were together almost every day. Wei\u00dfheimer had become almost indispensable for Wagner, so, despite the 25-year difference in age, a warm friendship developed. Wagner's recurrent financial difficulties prompted Wei\u00dfheimer to visit his father in order to request financial help for his friend. Johann complied. This was Wagner's first visit to the Stone Mill. He met Wendelin's parents, siblings, and last but not least, the \"wine\" on 1 June 1862. When he had to stay in bed a few weeks due to illness, Wagner paid a surprise visit to the Stone Mill to leave Wendelin the only copy of The Valkyrie for Wendelin's appreciation. In the garden pavilion by the lake shore, known as \"Richard-Wagner-house,\" Wagner spent many hours boozing and proved to be a brilliant entertainer. That August, Wagner returned to the Stone Mill, this time accompanied by Hans and Cosima von B\u00fclow."

Wagner's admirers denied him further assistance. To relieve Wagner's financial difficulties Wei\u00dfheimer organized a concert at the Leipzig Gewandhaus on 1 November 1862. Despite the personal involvement of Wagner, von B\u00fclow and other renowned artists and organizations with works by Wagner, Liszt and Wei\u00dfheimer, the attendance at the concert was so low that not enough revenue was collected to cover the costs.This concert was the first time that Richard Wagner was allowed to perform in Germany after his exile. This concert was the first time that Wagner had been allowed to perform in Germany after his exile. Wei\u00dfheimer writes: \"Instead of Wagner filling up his pockets, I quickly had to call my father for help,\" and again and again latter provided financial support. Wagner no longer held events in Biebrich but moved to Vienna in November 1862. There he again tried to premiere \"Tristan,\" but without success. Although Wagner had a lot of money from a concert tour in Russia in 1863, he was again in financial straits. Finally, he had to flee from Vienna to avoid being put in debtors' prison. On 29 April 1864, Wendelin Wei\u00dfheimer received a telegram from Stuttgart from Wagner, asking him for an immediate visit. Wei\u00dfheimer went and Wagner reported his financial and psychological breakdown. Wei\u00dfheimer thus decided to stay with Wagner. Since Wagner was in debt he was urged to disappear. They agreed on a secluded spot in Rauhe Alb, where Wei\u00dfheimer would accompany him. There Wei\u00dfheimer intended to finish the piano score of the first Meistersingers act as quickly as possible in order to persuade the publisher, Schott, to make additional payments. Their journey had been set for 3 May, as Wagner wanted to see a performance of Don Giovanni conducted by Karl Eckert. However, on 2 May, at the hotel Marquard, the Secretary of King Ludwig II of Bavaria, Council of State Franz Seraph von Pfistermeister, appeared with a mission to explore the residence of Richard Wagner and return with him to Munich. When crown Prince Ludwig II listened to Wagner's Lohengrin he said: \"When I am crowned, I want to show the world how much I know of the genius of Wagner.\" He was seeking a way to maintain his self-given promise. As Wagner's most ardent admirer, he wanted to give him the opportunity to finish his Der Ring des Nibelungen. So, instead of the rough journey to the Alps, Wagner went on 3 May 1864 to Munich, and after the reception by the King, returned to Vienna to pay his debts before he moved into the Villa on Lake Starnberg provided to him by the King."

After studying economics, history and philosophy, he dealt primarily with social issues and made it his life's work to create a \"democratic party for social progress\" which the monarchy respected as the uppermost representative of the people. Wei\u00dfheimer was attracted by Lassalle's writings. In July 1864 Wei\u00dfheimer found out that Lassalle had arranged an excursion in the Palatinate with the countess Sophie von Hatzfeld. He invited both to Stone Mill. The news of Lassalle's arrival quickly spread in Osthofen. The villagers watched, with curiosity, as both guests walked from the railway station to the Stone Mill on 6 July. At the Stone Mill the reception was polite. Lassalle captivated the Wei\u00dfheimer family for hours describing his plans and goals and he spoke with Johann Wei\u00dfheimer on his studies about Franz von Sickingen. Lassalle made friends there and when they parted, he ordered a barrel of the \"Riesling\" which he had been served. Wendelin Wei\u00dfheimer spent several days in the Palatinate with Lassalle, the Countess von Hatzfeld and other friends. Wendelin was invited to accompany Lassalle on a trip to the east of Switzerland but, because of an urgent message received from his wife, who had fallen seriously ill in Leipzig, he had to decline the invitation. Lassalle traveled alone to Lake Lucerne in mid-July, while the Countess von Hatzfeld went to Wildbad for a cure. Lassalle met Helena von D\u00f6nniges, daughter of historian Wilhelm von D\u00f6nniges, known to him from Berlin. This occasion turned disastrous as Lassalle was challenged to a duel and was fatally shot. Lassalle's death was a severe blow that took Wendelin a long time to overcome, convinced that Lassalle's death could have been averted if he had stayed with him. Throughout his life Wendelin remained faithful to the Social Democratic Party, although this commitment brought disadvantages for his professional career."

        "content": "Wendelin Wei\u00dfheimer became music director in Augsburg. Despite his official duties and numerous other engagements he continued to compose. After scoring songs and ballads of the German Minnesang, as well as from Goethe and other poets, he dealt with his first opera Theodor K\u00f6rner. Franz Liszt and Wagner spoke appreciatively of this work. Lassalle, who had particularly liked the libretto and was equally enthusiastic about the music, had offered to write Wei\u00dfheimer a textbook on Florian Geyer, Thomas Munzer or the Bohemian Jan \u017di\u017eka, but his death put an end to this idea. Wagner had written for Wei\u00dfheimer a draft for the opera, Wieland the Blacksmith, but gave it back before scoring it. For the premiere of Theodor K\u00f6rner at the Berlin Court Opera, Liszt began with the former artistic director Count von Redern. However, Count von Redern recommended Liszt to run the premiere on a different stage because Prince Louis Ferdinand was to play a role which would affect the Prussian royal family too strongly. For the premiere to be accommodated elsewhere it would be important to gain Wagner's support, for whom Wendelin had fought for many years. But Wagner was too immersed in his own work to be of any help. Wei\u00dfheimer's negotiations with Munich moved very slowly. While a conductor at the Augsburg palace, Wendelin married Rosalie Scholle from Leipzig on 10 January 1865. They were married for 45 years but produced no children. Rosalie survived her husband, dying at the age of 79 on 25 September 1920 in Darmstadt. From Augsburg, Wei\u00dfheimer went to the Kroll Opera in Berlin, then to the theater in D\u00fcsseldorf. From 1866 to 1868 he was in W\u00fcrzburg. From here he tried once again a world premiere of his patriotic opera Theodor K\u00f6rner. For this reason he looked up to Wagner in Munich. Wagner was living with Hans and Cosima von B\u00fclow in a house on Arcisstra\u00dfe, donated to him by the king and where Cosima was a housewife who took care of Wagner's correspondence. Wagner soon became interested in Mrs. B\u00fclow. His relationship with Wei\u00dfheimer began to wane, and Wei\u00dfheimer drew closer to Peter Cornelius at the premiere of the latter's 1865 opera Der Cid. The friendship between Wei\u00dfheimer and Richard Wagner ended in June 1868. This was after Cosima, without reviewing the music, wrote on 6 July to Wei\u00dfheimer that the text of his \"Theodor K\u00f6rner\" could not be performed in court theaters because its seditious tendency might provoke trouble in peaceful times. Wendelin, like his father, was stubborn and didn't support her views. His disagreement with Cosima came between him and Wagner. The situation was compounded when Wendelin Wei\u00dfheimer recognised their love affair. He sided with the betrayed von B\u00fclow. At the premiere of Die Meistersinger in Munich on 21 June 1868, Wei\u00dfheimer had his last encounter with Wagner."

Now Wei\u00dfheimer moved to Baden-Baden where he became in charge of the larger spa concerts. Together with Otto Dessoff he headed the concerts of the artists meeting with the performance of his Master Martin and his companions in May 1880. In the large central lodge, Wei\u00dfheimer listened to the performance together with Liszt and French composer Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns outright, receiving from both acclaimed recognition for his accomplishment. In the following years Wendelin Wei\u00dfheimer conducted for several years despite personal disappointment, with continuing veneration of Wagner's genius, at the famous Teatro La Scala in Milan. He had his residence on the idyllic Lake Como. Around 1893, Wei\u00dfheimer moved to Freiburg im Breisgau in order to focus on his literary career. His 1898 book, Experiences with Richard Wagner, Franz Liszt and many other contemporaries saw three editions in one single year. Around 1900 he moved to Nuremberg and from Freiburg and Nuremberg the way led him back again more often to his native homeland at the Stone Mill. In the casino society there he spent hours with old friends whom he pleased most joyfully with improvisations on works by Wagner and Liszt and on his own compositions. In his last years, Wei\u00dfheimer led mass choirs at social-democratic Party Congresses. His target was the huge masses of the workers' movement.

Even though he tried compositionally to go his own way, he could not emerge from the shadow of his great teacher Liszt, and of Wagner. His operas, his cantatas, and his instrumental music underline this. Even if his \"absolute\" music pays homage to one of the great string quartet and successful \"obligatory violin parts\" to Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, he displays in his other works a clear tendency for program music. Wei\u00dfheimer's piano pieces Reminiscence of Gioventu and At Beethoven's Grave, as well as his Symphony for Schiller's Knight Toggenburg match the spirit of the New German School. His literary taste is evident in the texts he set to music. German minstrel poems, texts by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, K\u00f6rner, Heinrich Heine and others found a musical home in his songs and cantatas. Wei\u00dfheimer summarized his individual compositions into larger cycles. Thus arose the 24 songs in the cycle \"German minstrel,\" the 18 settings of Goethe, as well as songs from Heine and K\u00f6rner, appeared for the men's choir \"Eight Songs,\" along with previously unpublished choral cycles. After his departure with Wagner, Wei\u00dfheimer turned increasingly to the labor movement and exercised with his compositions for male chorus a particular influence on the cultural aspirations of the Social Democratic Party of Germany."

        "content": "Romina Daniele (born Naples, 8 February 1980) is an Italian exponent of the vocal extended technique, an avant-garde and blues singer, a composer of electronic and experimental music, vocalist and performer associated with contemporary music, writer, photographer. Since 2005, she has been working on sound research in the fields of vocalism and electronic music, and since 2013 she has been working as blues singer as well. In 2005 she has been awarded with the Demetrio Stratos International Prize for musical experimentation for the emerging artist best project, proposing the project Diffrazioni Sonore (RDM, 2005\u20132010). The Career Awards have been received by Diamanda Gal\u00e1s in 2005, Meredith Monk in 2007, Fred Frith in 2008, and F\u00e1tima Miranda in 2009. She has been a finalist at \u2018Premio Nazionale delle Arti' (Arts National Award) for Electronic Music and New Technologies, presenting the composition for voice and electronics La Prova, taken from her second record Aisth\u00e0nomai, il Dramma della Coscienza (RDM, 2008\u20132010) in 2010 edition, and presenting the electro-acoustic composition La Natura Assente in 2011 edition. In 2011 she has been awarded with the 'Arci Award' for musical experimentation promoted by the Italian contemporary music centre \"Centro Musica Contemporanea\" in collaboration with the Italian cultural associations Arci, presenting a preview from her new work titled Spannung. The related concert took place at the big stage area of \"Carroponte\" (Sesto San Giovanni, Milan) in July 2011. The project has been presented in its different stages during the last performances as well, while detailed information has been given by the artist on the occasion of the 'Arci Award'. Between 2006 and 2012, she presented her work and research at many prestigious festival like Arezzo Wave, Electronika Festival Aterforum Festival \u2013 during the meeting with Meredith Monk, 5 Giornate per la Nuova Musica Festival \u2013 with which she has been collaborating since 2008, Salone Internazionale del Libro; London Hoxton Festival; Intermidia Festival \u2013 Slovakia; gaining attention from the international press as well. In the middle of 2013, she founded the band with which mainly pays homage to the greatest women of rhythm and blues, \"to bring back and bring up that unique and originary strength, passion and pain, today forgotten especially in Europe; that is one thing with my deeper work\". The band has been performing since May 2013 all over the Milan area. As she said, \"the Blues is at the center as feeling and intention in a variety of styles that will allow us to cross \u2013 within the limits of our ability \u2013 the twentieth century, from Swing to Fusion\". (Romina Daniele on One TV) Between electronics and vocal experimentation, live studio session in solo and with the band, extended vocalism and blues, her latest record is a triple cd titled Spannung produced between 2009 and 2015, and released on December the 24th 2015. The book Voce Sola \u2013 essay on the vocal discourse to be released in 2016 \u2013 has been written during the same years."

        "content": "Daniele was born and grown in Naples, where she studied classic dance and classic guitar, and started to write poems, tales, songs, to paint and to photograph since she was a child. In the Nineties she participated to exhibitions and was noted and mentioned by local and national magazines. The poems written between 1995 and 2005 are today part of the collected poems book Poesie 1995\u20132005, English and Italian bilingual edition (RDM, 2010). After the studies on Art criticism, aesthetics and Cinema at the University of Naples Suor Orsola Benincasa, and that in vocals with Auli Kokko (singer for Daniele Sepe's band), Daniele focuses herself in musical activity moving to Milan in 2005, where \"the climate for experimental singing is more receptive\", and where she received the Stratos Prize and has gone through different professional experiences as well. During the academic year 2006\u20132007 she teaches the results of her vocal research included in the record Diffrazioni Sonore at \"Crams School of Music\" in Lecco (Italy), working for collective experimental laboratories, concerts, and individual lessons as well. Diffrazioni Sonore, released in 2005 and her first album project, \"consists entirely of multi-tracked, and entirely improvised vocal music, some of it treated digitally (radical EQ, echo, and a little reverb), but otherwise left well enough alone\", and is focused on the relationship between improvisation and construction. The second record Aisth\u00e0nomai, il Dramma della Coscienza, released in 2008, for voice and electronics, is focused on sound research in the fields of vocalism and electronic music, including compositions with texts in Italian, English and French. Consisting of textual philosophizing more abundantly, it can be read like a theoretical work, an organized anthology and a poetical-musical form. As Rick Moody writes, Daniele's approach seems to come more from the wilds of literature, and particularly from the wilds of European philosophy, than from any rigorous background in music. Both the two released records are, in fact, loaded with literature references, as a quick look at the booklets points out. They both include \"theoretical line texts\" which look like essays or manifestos; on one hand these essays explain the foundation of Daniele's musical activity, coming mostly from contemporary philosophy, in particular from the French philosophy by Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes and the theoretic-linguistic vision by Pier Paolo Pasolini; on the other hand, as Dionisio Capuano remarks, \"her theoretic will can hamper the total fruition\". In the interviews Daniele declares herself to be devoted to \"feeding doubt and a whirlpool of feelings, my primarily aim is structuring thought: a human one.\" Otherwise, music with new technologies is elected as research device, superior to every other one, in the study on the human being; in the same way, the voice is the most powerful mean of human expression, from an anthropological, physiological, and linguistic point of view, and just secondly a musical instrument."

        "title": "Romina Daniele_In particular:",
        "content": "Diffrazioni Sonore is a result of the research I have been conducting since 2000 in a number of areas: voice, composition by electronic means, philosophy applied to multimedia. Studying film history and theory, art criticism and aesthetic analysis, I approached the fields of thought that my research is based on, which include Gilles Deleuze\u2019s philosophy and Michel Chion\u2019s theory applied to film, a multimedia art form. I am referring specifically to the linguistic and morphological foundations of my work, by virtue of the relationship between, and coexistence among, different languages, including voice, poetry, writing, music, electronics, art, thought, man. (Romina Daniele on the Rumpus) In an interview on the Rockerilla magazine, she also mentioned film-makers and painters as influences for her musical work: \"Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Marcel Proust, Friederich Nietzsche and Henri Bergson, Jusepe de Ribera and Francis Bacon, David Lynch and Michelangelo Antonioni.\" Between 2006 and 2008, during the work on her second record Daniele wrote the essay Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud, Il luogo della musica nell'audiovisione (RDM, 2011), in English: the site of music in Audio-Vision, title which reminds to two previous studies, one is the Site of Film by Christian Metz , the other is Audio-Vision by Michel Chion. As a matter of fact, the essay is the dissertation thesis with which Daniele degreed Cum Laude in Cinema Studies, supervised by professor Augusto Sainati from the Sorbonne of Paris, who has been studying the cinema combining the semiotic analysis and the historical and sociological points of view for a long time. Daniele's thesis is focused on the relationship between music and image in the cinema, conducted through the detailed analysis of the French movie Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud (1959) by Louis Malle, with soundtrack by Miles Davis. Furthermore, Daniele honours the Davis soundtrack covering the piece Nuit sur les Champs-\u00e9lys\u00e9es in the second record. At the end of 2008, she starts studying electronic music, as post graduate studies, at the Milan Conservatory, which led her to one of the finalists for the 'National Award of Arts' in 2010 and 2011. In the same year she also starts working in the field of silent movies screened with live improvisations by a collaboration with Riccardo Sinigaglia Electro-acoustic ensemble. Between the 2008 and 2011 she dedicated herself to literature production, publishing the books mentioned above and the essay Il dialogo con la materia disintegrata e ricomposta, un'analisi di Thema (Omaggio a Joyce) di Luciano Berio (RDM, 2010). It is an analysis of Thema (Omaggio a Joyce) by Luciano Berio, described as the first electro-acoustic composition in the history of western music made entirely with voice and elaboration of it by technological means. The voice was that of the great American avant-garde singer Cathy Berberian, reading from the Ulysses by James Joyce. Thus, this book is categorized as a biography, and also as an autobiography as can be found in Google Books. On the other hand, Daniele has been working on the essay Voce Sola (Solo Voice) for some years, a book describing her aesthetic and linguistic research in all fields of her activity, mostly focused on music and vocalism. Considering the contemporary western music and its twentieth-century history from the Musique concr\u00e8te to the experimental music, to the most recent experiences on technology applied to music, her work seems focused on a kind of electronic music as sound research or sound art. From the vocal point of view her work is focused on the transfiguration of the song form through the organic changing of the voice, vocals-electronics assimilation, the dramatic experimentation on the text-vocals, sound poetry and the total theatre-song: A peculiar combination of different disciplines including theatre, philosophy, aesthetics and electronics used as a movie soundtrack, can be seen as a real opera of avant-garde theatre. Romina Daniele put herself in front of the audience stimulating it and producing a thrilling and a charming sound with vocals creating dark/shining atmospheres throwing the listener in a lyrics-voice-music spiral that oblige us to confront with ourselves. (Alessio Arena on Drexkode) Although, as Moody remarks, Daniele's work \"is not only complex, only demanding, only methodical, but, actually, though it has its challenges, it is also playful, sweet, sometimes funny, and, on occasion, rooted in an appreciation of vernacular music like jazz, blues, and pop.\" In fact, speaking about her Blues live concerts, Romina Daniele said: I am doing the Blues today because I feel it like a shear, vertical push that starts from the inside, comes out from every pore and goes straight to the heart. And this is one thing at the base of my work, which very often has been positively welcomed in the contemporary avant-garde fields and similar, where sometime, it can happen, the fundamental things of life are lost which indeed are the strength and the instinctivity of the emotions. (Romina Daniele on Rock an Roll Radio) Between 2009 and 2012 she studies New Technologies and Electronic Music at the Milan Conservatory. And so, as said before, she represented the Conservatorio di Milano at the final stage of \u2018Premio Nazionale delle Arti' (Arts National Award) 2010 and 2011 editions. She studied with Riccardo Sinigaglia, Alessandro Melchiorre, Giovanni Cospito; she has attended many workshops and seminars among which we can mention those of Meredith Monk, Trevor Wishart, David Moss and Annette Vande Gorne. RDM Records was born in 2010 through her collaboration, with the purpose of promoting research and the technical and aesthetic autonomy. The title of her latest record is Spannung, from German: tension, opening of the research. Particularly significant in this work is the cycle of the Dasein, divided in three parts and themes, which is the title of her 2010\u20132012 performances as well. Dasein, from German as well: being; in Martin Heidegger's philosophy: being the here, to be at stake of one's being into the being itself. As Romina Daniele said, both the record and the book Voce Sola \u2013 essay on the vocal discourse: indicates the opening, the space, the tension (and the yearning) of being in the size of the authenticity of existence, that is what we are and are looking for: to be at stake of one\u2019s being into the being itself with everything of us into the world before it goes away in vain. Voice is what there was at the beginning, a question of body and thought, the focus and the cornerstone, and there are no other places or sounds like that at all. Then music is an essential act concerning the apprehension for man and his work as well."

He served as the Mayor of Raleigh, North Carolina from 1975 until 1977. Coggins was born to a poor family in 1921 in Iredell County, North Carolina, United States. He moved to Chapel Hill in 1939 to pursue a university education, but dropped out due to ill health and took up various jobs. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1942 and fought in World War II as a bomber pilot. Following his discharge in 1946, Coggins moved to Raleigh to resume his education. He shortly thereafter abandoned his studies to start his own construction company. Over time the business grew and completed projects across the southeastern United States, and Coggins became a millionaire. In 1963 he, a conservative Democrat, was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives. Two years later he was elected to the North Carolina Senate. Over the course of his legislative career he advocated for the disabled and opposed liquor, pornography, and coed dormitories on state university campuses. He also frequently disregarded the wishes of state Democratic leaders, earning a reputation as a maverick. Coggins left the Senate in 1971 and unsuccessfully sought a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives the following year. Coggins was elected Mayor of Raleigh in 1975. During his tenure, the Raleigh City Council was split evenly between members aligned with community and environmental activists who wanted to limit the city's growth and others who represented business interests and sought to promote development. The division brought about frequent clashing between Coggins\u2014who had an abrasive, uncompromising style and supported further development in Raleigh\u2014and members of the council. He was challenged in his 1977 reelection bid by Isabella Cannon, who ran at the behest of a coalition of community activists. Coggins frequently attacked the coalition throughout the campaign. Despite having the endorsement of Raleigh's two newspapers and outspending his opponent, he lost the election. He died on August 25, 2011."

He was the third of five children in a poor family. Both of his parents worked at the Kannapolis Cotton Mill. When Coggins was thirteen years old his father died, and he moved to Statesville to work on a farm, sending a portion of his income back to his family to support it. He graduated from Iredell County's Central High School in 1939. Coggins hitchhiked from his family's farm to Chapel Hill to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He studied at the school from 1939 until 1940, when he was forced to drop out due to ill health. He then worked a variety of jobs before enlisting in the United States Marine Corps in June 1942. Seeking to become an aviator, he undertook training courses in Chapel Hill; Anacostia, Maryland; and Pensacola, Florida, and was commissioned as a lieutenant on August 17. He completed his operational flight training on November 6 and was subsequently sent to San Diego to join American forces moving out for deployment in World War II. Coggins served as a bomber pilot and fought in the South Pacific, earning ten military awards, including two Distinguished Flying Crosses. Coggins became known as \"Bomber Jack\" to his fellow Marines during the war and garnered the rank of First Lieutenant before he was discharged in 1946. Coggins returned to North Carolina and enrolled in North Carolina State College in Raleigh, building his own duplex to reside in while he pursued his studies. Anticipating a post-war construction boom, he dropped out in 1947 to pursue a career in contracting. Coggins married Frances Katherine Lyon on September 24, 1943 in Jacksonville, Florida. They had five daughters together. Coggins was a Presbyterian Christian, and was a member of a masonic lodge, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the American Legion, and the Raleigh Civitan Club."

        "content": "Coggins founded the Coggins Construction Company. His first projects were small duplexes. Over time Coggins gradually expanded his building work to include apartment complexes and government buildings. His construction company completed projects across the southeastern United States, including development at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point and the erection of Beckanna Apartments, an eight-story, 250-unit housing complex on Glenwood Avenue in Raleigh which he named for two of his daughters. Coggins later engaged in real estate speculation. Believing that U.S. Route 70 would become an important channel of commercial activity between Raleigh and Durham, he began to purchase land along the highway, eventually amassing over 250 acres. He leased some of the land in the area and oversaw a significant amount of real estate development along the road, sometimes provoking the ire of local residents. He also founded the Lyon Equipment Company and Dob's, Inc. Coggins frequently attended to his business, and he had little spare time to interact with friends and family or engage in leisurely activities. Over the course of his career he became a millionaire. His newfound wealth allowed him to purchase a large home and 16-acres of land in western Raleigh. He founded Raleigh Memorial Park, a cemetery. His last development project was the erection of a large mausoleum in the cemetery. Coggins had wanted to build such a structure since the 1950s but never had any commercial support to do so, and decided to personally construct it in the early 1990s. He dedicated it to his wife. Coggins served as chairman of the board of Textile Research Services, Inc.. He was also a member of the National Association of Cemeteries, North Carolina Cemetery Association, Raleigh Merchants Bureau, Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, North Carolina Association of Quality Restaurants, North Carolina Motel Association, Association of General Contractors, Raleigh Board of Realtors, and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen."

Coggins was then elected to the 12th district seat in North Carolina Senate, representing Wake County, in 1965. He won re-election to the Senate in 1967 and 1969, serving until 1971. In the 1969\u20131970 legislative session, he served as Chairman of both the Senate Appropriations Committee on Health, Welfare and Institutional Care, and the Senate Committee on Libraries. Over the course of his time in the legislature, he advocated for the disabled and opposed liquor, pornography, and coed dormitories on state university campuses. In 1971 he introduced a bill that would prohibit students from visiting opposite sex dormitories on state university campuses, but it was defeated in committee. Throughout his tenure he gained a reputation as a maverick, frequently ignoring the wishes of state Democratic leaders. Speaking about his legislative career in 1975, he said, \"I was not a special-interest legislator. I was never bothered by lobbyists much in the legislature.\" In 1972 Coggins sought the U.S. House of Representatives seat from North Carolina's 4th congressional district. He lost the Democratic Party's nomination to Ike Franklin Andrews in a primary election."

        "content": "In the 1970s citizens of Raleigh became increasingly concerned about the city's rapid population growth and the consequences of unchecked real estate development. These people formed civic and neighborhood associations which unified as a collective political bloc, the Community Coalition, that supported a more managed process for dealing with Raleigh's expansion. The coalition's electoral strength contributed to the election of Clarence Lightner as Mayor of Raleigh in 1973. In 1975, Coggins sought the office of Mayor, challenging Lightner, whose reputation had suffered from family legal troubles, though Coggins did not openly discuss them. He emphasized during his campaign that he had never maintained a campaigning organization on his behalf or accepted a political donation, noting that his \"loner\" status in politics made him less suspicious than other candidates with potential ties to real estate developers. He placed first in the October mayoral primary election, earning 10,201 votes. Lightner placed third. He withdrew from the race and endorsed Coggins. Coggins faced City Councilman J. Oliver Williams in the November 4 election, who had the support of the Community Coalition. According to some reports, Coggins initially sought the support of some coalition members, but failed. He resorted to criticizing the bloc, accusing it of trying to take over the municipal government. Two local black voters' groups, the Raleigh Wake Citizens Association and the Wake County Black Democratic Political Caucus, endorsed him. Coggins won the election with 55 percent of the votes cast in his favor."

        "content": "Coggins assumed office on December 9, 1975. During his tenure, the eight-member Raleigh City Council was split evenly between members aligned with community and environmental activists who wanted to limit the city's growth and others who represented business interests and sought to promote development. The division brought about frequent clashing between Coggins\u2014who had an abrasive, uncompromising style and supported further development in Raleigh\u2014and members of the council. The disagreement emerged during the City Council's first meeting in December when Coggins called for a vote on the reelection of a returning member as mayor pro tempore. The four city council members supported by the Community Coalition asked that the vote be postponed until a later meeting when they could consider assigning all other leadership roles on the council. Coggins' disregarded their wish and proceeded with the vote, which tied among the councilmen. After breaking the tie with his own vote, Coggins angrily declared \"If we're going to have division, let's bring it to a head right now.\" He then told the four councilmen backed by the coalition, \"I refuse to be intimidated. I refuse to be coerced. And I will not be dictated to by any group regardless of who supports it.\" He later clarified that the \"group\" he alluded to was the Community Coalition. Relations between Coggins and the council remained tense throughout the rest of his term. The councilmen hotly debated whether the mayor should be empowered to refer proposals to committees without the council's consent. Coggins disagreed with the council about revisions to Raleigh's city charter, pushing for the abolition of the Community Advisory Council, a board which represented neighborhood civic associations. During his tenure the city council also failed to produce a plan for addressing Raleigh's development and growth. The frequent disagreement between Coggins and the council greatly contributed to the eventual resignation of one city councilman and the decision of two others to not seek reelection. While mayor, he also defeated a strike undertaken by black sanitation workers attempting to unionize and established a committee to examine the city's housing inspections department. On July 31, 1976 he was awarded an honorary doctor of law from Shaw University."

        "content": "Coggins sought reelection in 1977. He was challenged by a grassroots candidate, Isabella Cannon, who ran for the mayoral office at the behest of the Raleigh Coalition, a successor group to the Community Coalition. On September 13 Coggins, Cannon, and other candidates for municipal offices attended a forum hosted by the coalition. In his opening statement Coggins declared that he was not pursuing the coalition's endorsement, and characterized the group as \"a self-appointed, self-anointed group of people serving as an ad hoc city council in exile.\" At the forum's end he dismissed the event as a \"farce\". Cannon and the other candidates used their time to discuss local issues, and on September 20 the coalition endorsed Cannon. In the early weeks of the campaign, Coggins discussed Raleigh's need for jobs and his experience in business. Throughout its duration, he emphasized his political experience as mayor and as a legislator. He also frequently criticized the Raleigh Coalition for being \"anti-growth\". Some observers believed that Coggins attacked the coalition instead of Cannon directly because he was hesitant to speak poorly of an elderly woman. Coggins initially denied that this was the case, but later said, \"I still think a gentleman should treat a lady as a lady.\" Coggins spent $12,000 of his own money on his campaign effort, the most of any candidate for Raleigh municipal office in the 1977 election. He received the endorsement of the city's two daily newspapers, The Raleigh News and Observer and The Raleigh Times, as well as the support of the Raleigh Wake Citizens Association. The Wake County Black Democratic Political Caucus endorsed Cannon. During the final week of the campaign, Coggins spent $9,000 on newspaper advertisements, including $4,000 on four full-page ads. In an upset, Cannon defeated Coggins in the November 8 election, 14,508 votes to 13,315. Coggins won only 15 of Raleigh's 43 precincts, performing best in the wealthier neighborhood constituencies as well as the working-class areas of the eastern part of the city. Various theories were offered as to why Coggins lost. G. Wesley Williams, director of the Raleigh Merchants Bureau, believed that Coggins \"blew it\" by repeatably delivering \"vitriolic statements\" throughout his tenure. Journalists believed the split of the black vote\u2014which had previously unified behind Coggins\u2014contributed to his defeat. Coggins attributed his failure to the campaigning done by the Raleigh Coalition as well as negative press coverage of himself. His term ended in December. Reflecting on his political career in 1998, Coggins said, \"I never looked at politics as a profession. It was more of a hobby, my chance to give something back to the community since I had no talent for volunteering [for civic groups].\""

        "content": "Karl Sigmund Franz Freiherr vom Stein zum Altenstein (1 October 1770, in Schalkhausen near Ansbach \u2013 14 May 1840, in Berlin) was a Prussian politician and the first Prussian education minister. His most lasting impact was the reform of the Prussian educational system. The Altensteins were descended from a long-established Frankish noble family, whose family seat of Altenstein Castle was located on a ridge between Ebern and Maroldsweisach. Karl was born in 1770 as the son of the count-hussar captain and chamberlin Ernst Freiherr von Stein zum Altenstein of the Ostheim vor der Rh\u00f6n branch of the family, and his mother was Juliana Philippina Wilhelmina Freiin von Adelsheim, Ernsts's second wife. Karl was born in their castle at Oberm\u00f6rgerscheimp. After his education at the gymnasium and corps, he studied law in Erlangen, in 1790 in G\u00f6ttingen, and later in Jena. In 1793, he joined the referendary of the Prussian war and council chamber. His overseer, Karl August von Hardenberg, quickly recognized his talent and encouraged him to join the diplomatic corps. In 1799, he went with Hardenberg to Berlin where he worked for as a Ministerialrat and later became a senior financial officer for the general directorate. As a result of Prussia's losses in the Fourth Coalition War of the Napoleonic Wars at the battle of Jena-Auerstedt, he went with Hardenberg in 1806 to Tilsit to work on the Prussian Reforms. Plans for insurrection against the French occupation stalled the state minister Karl Freiherr vom Stein's reform plans. In 1808, Altenstein became his successor as the head of administration of Finance. He could not prevail against the forces set in motion by his predecessor to introduce reform so he continued them with the same energy. In 1810, Prussia could no longer afford the reparations agreed to in the Peace of Tilsit. Altenstein suggested the cessation of Silesia to France and so was dismissed in June by King Friedrich Wilhelm III at the instigation of Hardenberg. After his release, he went to Breslau where he was appointed civil governor of Silesia in 1813. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, he, together with Wilhelm von Humboldt in Paris, reclaimed treasures that had been confiscated by Napoleon. In 1817, he took over as head of the newly formed Ministry of Culture, again answering to Hardenberg, now State Chancellor. He was charged with the political responsibility of refounding the Evangelical Church in Prussia. In the next 20 years he reformed the Prussian schools, radically changing education. He is credited with the first \"humanistic\" school of education and the University of Bonn in 1818. With the Education Act of 1819, he developed a master plan for the system that still persists today: a multi-unit school system with a differentiation between primary and secondary education. In 1825, he extended compulsory education to the entire country, and in 1834, he introduced a mandatory curriculum for Gymansiums. In subsequent years, he fought for the education system to be independent of the church. He retired in 1838 because of declining health and died in 1840. He is buried in Berlin at the Dreifaltigkeitskirchhof II."

Phinney began his career at the Dickinson Type Foundry in Boston where he designed type and worked in management, eventually becoming owner.  He was a key player in arranging the merger of twenty-six large foundries to form the American Type Founders Company in 1892, becoming both manager of the Boston branch and head of the design department, where he oversaw the consolidation of type faces following the merger.  Though his own designs were largely derivative, Phinney took a great interest in type and its history and throughout his tenure at A.T.F. he sought to preserve and protect that company's legacy, as for instance, when he oversaw the re-introduction of Binny & Ronaldson's 1796 type design, Roman No. 1, as Oxford in 1892, or when he purchased Frederick W. Goudy's first type design, Camelot, in 1896.  He stayed with A.T.F. for the rest of his career, passing the role of design head to Morris Fuller Benton and becoming senior vice-president. Phinney retired shortly before the company fell upon hard times during the Great Depression and died in 1934."

He graduated from the University of Dorpat in 1816 and studied mineralogy with the Christian Samuel Weiss in Berlin. After the Berlin University, he studied in Paris and G\u00f6ttingen, where he received his Ph.D. Arriving in St. Petersburg, Kupfer was called to the chair of chemistry and physics at Kazan, and was sent by the Ministry of Education abroad for the purchase of physical instruments, where he went to Professor Ivan Simonov. In 1824, he arrived in Kazan and took his chair. Simultaneously, he worked on terrestrial magnetism, and magnetic charge of the geological expeditions in the vicinity of Mount Elbrus. Since 1828, he was a member of the Academy of Sciences of Mineralogy, and from 1840 in physics. In 1828, he traveled to the South and Middle Urals. He visited Zlatoust, Miass, and Chelyabinsk. After seeing the Ural Mountains in the vicinity of Zlatoust, he identified three mountain ranges: Urenga, Taganay, and Yurmu. In 1833, he published a book in French, compiled from the diaries he kept during the Urals travel, Journey to the Urals, undertaken in 1828. In 1834, a copy of this book was presented to Emperor Nicholas I. In 1829, Kupfer traveled to the Caucasus, and was later appointed director of the Mineralogical Museum, and founded the St. Petersburg Observatory, which focused on meteorological observations throughout the empire. Kupfer offered a plan to introduce a unified system of measures throughout Russia; he was chief executive of the Commission on Weights and Measures from 1832 to 1842. He led the development of Russian system of measures, and creation of the first standard units of mass and length, the platinum pounds and yards, as well as exemplary volume measures \u2013 buckets and the quadrangle. The results of his works were legitimized in the imperial decree in 1835, and they are described in the Travaux de la Commission pour fixer les mesures et les poids etc. (St. Petersburg, 1841). In 1843 he was elected ordinary academician. In 1859, he represented Russia at the Congress of the International Association for the introduction of a uniform system of measures, weights and coins in Bradford. Beginning in 1857, Russia and France began to exchange meteorological data. Kupfer went to the negotiations abroad, and in winter 1865, he arranged to create a telegraphic communication between all European countries. Being essentially the creator of combined weather service, Kupfer did not have time to enjoy the fruits of his labors. During cold weather in March, while he was installing on the roof of the observatory an anemograph (self-recording anemometer) that he brought from Paris, he caught cold and died of pneumonia two months later on 4 June 1865. He was buried in Smolensky Lutheran Cemetery in St. Petersburg. Kupffer also pioneered in the setting up magnetometric observatory which took hourly observations of the magnetic field of the Earth."

Ramon served as dean of the Schechter Rabbinical Seminary in Jerusalem from 2005 to 2009.

She is the author of the book A New Life: Religion, Motherhood and Supreme Love in the Works of Aharon David Gordon, and has contributed to the book New Jewish Feminism: Probing the Past, Forging the Future. She has also published articles on modern Jewish thought, Jewish feminism and Zionist intellectual history. In 2011 she left the Conservative Movement and the rabbinate due to ideological disputes. She no longer considers herself a rabbi.  Her affiliation is that of a modern Orthodox Jew. Since 2006, Dr. Ramon has been active in the clinical pastoral care movement in Israel. She has been involved in setting up the first clinical pastoral education unit in Israel, participating in the network and later the association of spiritual caregivers in Israel as the writer the ethical code for Israeli spiritual caregivers and the professional standards for training Israeli chaplains.

His piano works have been described as \"evoking Debussy but refracted through a 21st century prism\". Reviewer Brian Olewnick summarizes, \"Waller's music has centered around a kind of melodic classicism, the source of which I struggle to ascertain.\" Critic Harry Rolnick in reviewing a performance of his String Trio Per La Madre e La Nonna (2012), \"The harmonies were like something written by Dvor\u00e1k (perhaps his Cypresses), but they were obvious original.\" His chamber works feature a rich lyricism and counterpoint, described by Steve Smith of The New York Times as \"sweetly lyrical\".  In the October 2014 issue of the Brooklyn Rail, George Grella highlighted Waller as an emerging, unique artist in New York who deserves more critical attention, and to be heard by larger audiences, \"The fruits are heard on an EP released early this year, Five Easy Pieces, piano works played by Megumi Shibata and Jenny Q. Chai. The music is subtly affecting and shows his roots in Bart\u00f3k and Debussy without ever casting a shadow over his own voice and vision.\" Waller's early work was heavily focused on the avant-garde, with his use of microtonality, just intonation, new abstract forms, extensive glissandi, and isolated sonorities around frequent silences. During this period, he also composed electroacoustic music with monolithic drones and interference beats, and overall features appreciation for slow durations, exotic harmonic relationships, and process-based phenomenon. His postminimal chamber works have been performed by members of the S.E.M. Ensemble and FLUX Quartet, performing at venues such as ISSUE Project Room and Carnegie Hall. He also curates an avant-garde program in New York City, the NewIdeas MusicSeries, with composers Phill Niblock, Elliott Sharp,  a duo with David First, and many more performing. He was written up in TimeOut Classical, \"Composer and visual artist Michael Vincent Waller, who also happens to be a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela, opens the second season of the plugged-in new-music series\"."

The house is said to be the third-oldest residence still standing in Ponce. It is located on the southwest corner of Calle Union and Calle Reina. In 1912, his home was used as the first site of Liceo Ponce\u00f1o, Puerto Rico's first girls-only school. After Liceo Ponce\u00f1o vacated the home around the 1950s-1960s, the house was occupied for several years by various small businesses, including a travel agency and a toy store. Subsequently, it was vacant for several years. Then, in 2006-2009, the 1882 Casa Saur\u00ed was meticulously renovated and adapted as part of a new hotel, the Ponce Plaza Hotel & Casino, which opened in 2009. The hotel design included a four-story addition located next to the house, and a parking garage."

Born Nickolas Konstantin Athanasios Psacharopoulos VII, he claimed to have organized his first theatrical troupe at age 15 under the Nazi occupation of his homeland. He moved to the United States in 1947 and attended Oberlin College where he directed productions for the Oberlin Mummers. He graduated in 1951 with a degree in art history. Three years later he received a Master of Fine Arts Degree in theater direction from the Yale Drama School. In 1955, he joined the faculty of Yale's undergraduate theater studies department and also taught in the graduate Drama School, where he remained until his death from colon cancer at age 60. Psacharopoulos was a co-founder of the Williamstown Theater Festival (WTF) in 1955, based in the Adams Memorial Theater on the campus of Williams College. Psacharopoulos went on to serve as WTF's sole artistic executive director for 33 years, creating a professional summer theater that was more than a typical summer stock escapist operation. He was aided for many years by Tom Brennan, who served as the WTF associate director. Under Psacharopoulos' leadership, WTF specialized in the plays of Anton Chekhov and Bertolt Brecht, as well as the work of many classic American playwrights such as Tennessee Williams, Thornton Wilder, Arthur Miller, and Archibald MacLeish. Psacharopoulos traveled often between his Greek homeland and New York City, his main residence, where he staged theater productions with the Circle-in-the-Square, the New York Pro Musica, and City Opera. Many directors and leaders of American theater were inspired by Nikos' guidance. Each year he would choose an assistant from his students at Yale or Circle in the Square NYC, to accompany him to WTF to experience their first seasons as professional directors."

His study of the Chinese Revolution and the People's Republic was in conjunction with his strong interest in socialist ideology, Marxism, and Maoism in particular. He authored a number of books including Mao's China: A History of the People's Republic (and subsequent editions) which became a standard academic text in that area. Maurice Meisner was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1931 to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. He had two marriages each lasting about 30 years, first to Lorraine Faxon Meisner and subsequently to Lynn Lubkeman. He had three children from the first marriage and one child from the second.

        "content": "Meisner grew up in Detroit during the austere years of the Great Depression and World War II. But by the time he reached adulthood during the post-war boom, Detroit was a thriving center of culture as well as the auto industry. He remained in Detroit, enrolling at Wayne State University. An outstanding student, Meisner was admitted to a graduate program there after only two years of college. However this was also the beginning of the Cold War and the Red Scare in the U.S., having serious repercussions on the personal lives of Maurice Meisner and his  wife Lorraine. As part of the McCarthy era investigations, Lorraine was subpoenaed before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1952 in relation to her attendance at the World Festival of Youth and Students held in East Berlin the previous year. Like most witnesses called before hearings of HUAC or the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS), Lorraine Meisner refused to testify to the body. Although this assertion of her Fifth Amendment rights had no direct legal consequences, David Henry, president of Wayne State University where she was also a student, saw fit to expel her from the university. Although seen as an unusually harsh move even at the time, other schools were reluctant to admit a student dismissed under such circumstances. The Meisners moved to Chicago after they had been accepted to study at the University of Chicago, where they both would eventually receive doctorates. Maurice Meisner undertook to study Chinese history at a time when this would be considered an obscure choice, but where the emerging significance of China might be discerned in the wake of the 1949 revolution and role of China in the Korean War. This included studying the Chinese language to do research and travel in order to collaborate with the rather few China scholars of the time. Meisner's doctoral dissertation was prepared under the Sovietologist Leonard Haimson and developed in further year of research at the East Asian Research Center at Harvard. It was later published by Harvard University Press. In it, Meisner studied the original contributions to Chinese revolutionary theory by the co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party, Li Dazhao to show that the adaptation of Marxism to China which had been attributed to Mao Zedong had actually been accomplished by Li. Maurice Meisner was an early member of the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars (CCAS). In addition to opposing American participation in the Vietnam War, the group also involved itself in demystifying China at a time in which \"Red China\" was regularly portrayed as a threat to America, arguably surpassing the Soviet Union as a target of anti-communist sentiment toward the end of the 1960s. Meisner wrote for their publication, the Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars, and at the time of his death in 2012 he was still listed on the advisory board of the journal. Beginning with an article in the 1963 The China Quarterly, he published articles in the leading journals in the field, including Asian Survey, Current History, Journal of Asian Studies, and Modern China, among others."

        "content": "In 1968 the nation was in a state of apprehension and unrest given the continuing war in Vietnam and movements for the empowerment of minorities. This was the same year as the Tet Offensive which became widely viewed as a psychological turning point in the Vietnam war and American public opinion, the assassination of Martin Luther King and its aftermath, anti-war protests and police violence at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and election of Richard Nixon as president. Protest activity on and off the university campuses was reaching a crescendo and Madison happened to be one of the most affected campuses, bolstered by its large student body which in large part came from outside of Wisconsin. Highlights included militant protests against Dow Chemical which produced the napalm used in Vietnam, demonstrations and student strike demanding a Black Studies department at the university, a campus-wide strike by graduate assistants, the nationwide student strike following the 1970 U.S. invasion of Cambodia, and the 1970 bombing of the Army Math Research Center also in protest of the war. Radical politics was in the air, bringing to the fore radical organizations and ideologies ranging from anarchism to various Marxist currents. Thus Maurice Meisner began teaching the history of the Chinese revolution not only at the very time when revolutionary politics was being widely explored and debated, but where the specifics of the Chinese revolution seemed very relevant to many radicalizing youth who were hardly enthralled by the nominally Marxist pro-Soviet Communist Party (which threw its electoral support to the Democratic Party). The Chinese Communist Party, in contrast, had denounced the Marxism of the Soviet Union as \"revisionist,\" and Maoist groups were prominent among the more militant factions involved in protest actions and ideological debate. Interest in Meisner's Chinese history course was greatly bolstered by this perception of an international revolutionary pole headquartered in China along with Meisner's sympathy with the socialist goals underlying the Chinese revolution. Thus the one-time niche field of Chinese history gave way to a wider politically motivated audience requiring a large lecture hall. 1968 was during the Cultural Revolution in China, which received much fanfare among Western radicals but about which little was actually known. Many Maoists in the West found inspiration in the (perceived) role of the Red Guards, just as the English version of Mao's Red Book became widely toted as a revolutionary handbook. Competing Maoist groups in the U.S. (such as from the breakup of SDS) and the West attached themselves to the legacy of Mao Zedong and the cultural revolution, propelling interest in the recent history of China, the subject of Meisner's continuing research. As various absurdities and abuses committed during the Cultural Revolution became known, reactions of Maoist factions ranged from soul-searching to denial. Of obvious interest was Meisner's related research, although this was at a time when visiting the People's Republic was still impossible (as were visits by Chinese individuals to the West). Despite the difficulty in obtaining objective information, his study of the period made it into the classroom  and would be incorporated into his 1977 work Mao's China: A History of the People's Republic."

        "content": "By the late 1970s not only had the earlier wave of campus radicalism subsided, but definite changes were underway in China which were troubling, at best, to the remaining American Maoist currents and the so-called New Communist Movement which had emerged from the remnants of the New Left. Fascination with the cultural revolution had benefited from popular perceptions and slogans at a time when direct contact with Chinese communists was sparse, but in the years following Richard Nixon's China visit that began to change. With the death of Mao and the defeat of the Gang of Four, the political course of China was to rapidly change, whereas Western observers, both on the right and on the left, were often unable or unwilling to recognize the enormity of the transformation that had begun. This was just as Meisner's major work Mao's China was going to press, documenting the history and dynamics of the Chinese revolution up to that point. A subsequent edition of that book published in 1985 included additional chapters addressing the aftermath of the power struggle, but which still saw the market reforms instituted by Deng Xiaoping as a tactical turn in the development of socialism. Following some years of China's accelerating economic and political evolution, however, Meisner's assessment of the entire period became more sober as he traced the rise of what he termed \"bureaucratic capitalism,\" albeit under the official banner of building \"socialism with Chinese characteristics.\" Indeed, he saw the economic transformations underway as having set the stage for the democracy movement of 1989. The curious evolution of socialist China towards capitalism, all the while maintaining Communist Party rule, was the subject of Meisner's 1996 work The Deng Xiaoping Era: An Inquiry into the Fate of Chinese Socialism, 1978-1994. Meisner was himself in Beijing in 1989 up until a week before the crackdown on the democracy movement. His analysis of the protest movement contradicted both the official characterization of it as  a \"counterrevolutionary rebellion\"  and the Western media's inclination to depict any movement for greater democracy as welcoming of capitalism. Rather than simple concerns for greater democracy, the movement was propelled by a disgust of privilege attained by powerful bureaucrats which was seen as official corruption, and in fact a result of the market reforms. Meisner writes: [Calls against] \"Corruption\" now conveyed a moral condemnation of the whole system of bureaucratic privilege and power.... But now that Communist leaders, high and low, were so deeply enmeshed in profiteering in the presumably \"free\" marketplace, they had gone well beyond the bounds of politico-ethical legitimacy in popular perceptions. The use of political power for private gain was viewed as unfair and unjust, and it inflamed slumbering resentments against bureaucratic privilege."

        "content": "It was not only students and young people involved in the tumultuous social/political struggles permeating the campus during the 1960s and 70s. The issues rocking the campus naturally created divisions among academics, and most particularly those in history and the other the social sciences where the sorts of issues being played out on the streets were the very subject of academic instruction. In this context one can easily appreciate that Maurice Meisner would have connected to like-minded colleagues in the history department, resulting in a personal friendship with Professor Harvey Goldberg whose study of social movements in modern Europe mirrored Meisner's similar study of contemporary China. Goldberg was very well known and became extremely popular among radical students who would pack his lecture hall as he delivered his memorable orations which often took less the form of history lectures than as passionate political statements. Their friendship endured well past the heyday of campus activism, with them spending considerable time together as Goldberg's health suffered toward the late 1980s. Struck by the death of his friend in 1987, Meisner was instrumental in establishing the Harvey Goldberg Center for the Study of Contemporary History to honor and remember the beloved professor. In the spirit of Harvey Goldberg, the center would go on to sponsor quite a number of speakers, conferences and symposia especially around issues of social concern, connecting the study of history and society with activism as well as maintaining an archive of Goldberg's work. Maurice Meisner assumed the title of Harvey Goldberg Professor of History for the remainder of his university career. Towards the end of his life, in 2009, a conference was held in honor of Meisner's distinguished career entitled \"Reflections on History and Contemporary Change in China Before and After Tiananmen.\" The four-day conference, co-sponsored by the Harvey Goldberg Center, included a number of Meisner's former students, now themselves noted scholars of Chinese history. Following that conference three of Meisner's former students undertook to author and edit a book entitled Radicalism, Revolution, and Reform in Modern China: Essays in Honor of Maurice Meisner. The authors presented Meisner with an early copy of the book honoring him in 2011, the year before he died."

He studied graphic design and illustration at the University of Stellenbosch, and did a Master of Arts degree in illustration after graduating. Together with Conrad Botes, he co-founded the magazine Bitterkomix in 1992 and has become revered for its subversive stance and dark humor. He has been criticized for making use of \"offensive, racist imagery\". Kannemeyer himself said that he gets \"lots of hate mail from white Afrikaners\". His works challenge the rigid image of Afrikaners promoted under Apartheid, and depict Afrikaners having nasty sex and mangling their Afrikaans. \u201cX is for Xenophobia\u201d, part of his \"Alphabet of Democracy\", depicts Ernesto Nhamwavane, a Mozambican immigrant who was burnt alive in Johannesburg in 2008. Some of Kannemeyer's works deal with the issues of race relations and colonialism, by appropriating the style of Herg\u00e9\u2019s comics, namely from Tintin in the Congo. In \"Pappa in Afrika\", Tintin becomes a white African, depicted either as a white liberal or as a racist white imperialist in Africa. In this stereotyped satire, the whites are superior, literate and civilised, and the blacks are savage and dumb. In \"Peekaboo\", a large acrylic work, the white African is jumping up in alarm as a black man figure pokes his head out of the jungle shouting an innocuous 'peekaboo!' A cartoon called \"The Liberals\" has been interpreted as an attack on white fear, bigotry and political correctness: a group of anonymous black people (who look like golliwogs) are about to rape a white lady, who calls her attackers \"historically disadvantaged men\"."

        "content": "Pierina Gilli (August 3, 1911 \u2013 January 12, 1991), was a Roman Catholic Italian who claimed to receive messages from the Virgin Mary in 1947 and 1966. The apparitions were determined by the local ordinary, after consultation with the CDF, to be lacking in sufficient evidence of credibility. Pierina was born in the municipality of Montichiari  which is located in the Brescia province of the Lombardy region in northern Italy. She died there  when she was 79 years old. She is mainly known as the seer who claimed the Blessed Virgin Mary revealed herself as Rosa Mystica; the message focussed on Our Lady's motherly care for her deeply beloved consecrated souls of priests and of male and female members of religious institutes within the Roman Catholic Church. On October 15, 1984 the bishop of Brescia issued a statement: \"The Bishop of Brescia supported by the authoritative opinion of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, communicates that (a) the afore-mentioned apparitions of Our Lady the Mystical Rose in Montichiari do not present motives of credibility; (b) the cult relative to Our Lady the Mystical Rose, therefore, is not approved and can not be practiced nor favored; (c) whosoever favors it, by spreading publications or by organizing pilgrimages, does not help, but disturbs the faith of believers by inducing them to behave contrary to the disposition of the Church.\" Subsequent bishops, and the Foundation erected in 2014 to care for the pilgrims, have repeatedly clarified that the alleged apparitions have not been approved, and discouraged the premature promotion of Pierina Gilli's claims, while at the same time making provision for the spiritual care of those who nonetheless go there. This position was most recently reaffirmed in 2013 in the current Directory governing devotions in Fontanelle."

        "content": "Pierina Gilli was born on August 3, 1911, in the San Giorgio section of the northern Italian municipality of Montichiari. Her parents, Pancrazio Gilli and Rosa Bartoli, had three children, of which Pierina was the eldest. Her family was poor, as her father worked as a daily hired farm-worker. Due to its limited household income, the family often moved to various residences in Montichiari. When Pierina was seven years old her father, died, leaving her mother to support the three children. Between 1918 and 1922, Pierina was placed in a Montichiari orphanage, conducted by the sisters of the Handmaids of Charity. This experience had a lasting impact on Pierina. Pierina received her First Holy Communion in the orphanage when she was eight. Pierina returned to her family to assist her mother with the care of her two younger siblings, at the age of 11.  At age 12, her mother (who was now remarried), and eight siblings moved to live in a cottage with her step-family. Pierina claimed she had received inappropriate attention from her step-father. Although not wishing to introduce any discord into these two families that were now living together, Pierina eventually confided everything to her mother. Partly due to that trauma, Pierina decided to consider a vocation in the religious life at age seventeen. Her confessor advised her to wait, in order to further discern any genuine religious calling to the consecrated life. Despite all of Pierina's troubles, a soothing glimpse of her caring and devout family upbringing can be observed by this early childhood reminiscence from Pierina's diary: \"I was the first of nine children, I the first to be delighted in the joy, the bliss, and the caresses of my parents. The day of 3 August 1911 was the dawn of my earthly coming, and I was baptized on August 5, the feast of the Madonna of the Snow; on that given day, my Mamma consecrated me to the true Mamma in Heaven, so that her maternal protection would preserve me as white and pure as snow.\"."

When she was twenty years old, a marriage proposal was made to her by an honest and well-intentioned young man. For two months Pierina intimately suffered so much, because she did not feel herself to be called to the married life, but rather, she felt that the Lord wanted her totally for Himself. Her confessor finally spoke concerning her most genuine thoughts, thus confirming her vocation. Pierina was initially accepted as a postulant by the religious sisters' community of the Handmaids of Charity, but this soon had to be set aside for the first time by Pierina due to her health problems, including pleurisy, that persisted for several months. Instead, Pierina sought employment, and she worked for about seven years (from age 20 to 26: from 1931 to 1937) as a domestic servant of Father Giuseppe Brochini, and as caretaker of his elderly (frail and blind) mother, in the nearby small town of Carpenedolo. Pierina then focused on obtaining her nursing license at the \"White Villa\" Care Home (managed by the Sisters of Charity of St. Antida Thouret) in the city of Brescia. Subsequently, starting at age 29, and throughout the four years of World War II (1941\u20131945), she worked as a licensed nurse's aide in the Civil Hospital (managed by the Handmaids of Charity) in the smaller city of Desenzano del Garda, located on the southern shore of Lake Garda, within sight of the north Italian Alps."

        "content": "Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose was the foundress of the congregation of the Handmaids of Charity. She died in 1855, and was  canonized a saint on June 12, 1954 by Pope Pius XII. On April 14, 1944, Pierina, then 32 years old, was accepted as a postulant by the Handmaids of Charity. She never attained the profession of final religious vows at this religious institute. Even so, this congregation of women deeply influenced her spiritual growth during her formative years, continuing well into her later life. She was subsequently assigned as a nurse at the Children's Hospital in the city of Brescia. On December 1, 1944, Pierina contracted meningitis, and was taken to her religious order's infirmary in Ronco for infectious isolation and medical treatment. The infirmary was  located in a tiny section of the small Alpine village of Corteno Golgi, in the Brescia province.  After twelve days in a comatose state Pierina was administered the Last Rites. Pierina recorded that beginning December 17, 1944, the Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose began to appear to her. Sister Mary held a vial of ointment that was given to her by Our Lady, and she anointed Pierina, saying comfortingly to her: \"You will be cured, but you will have a heavy cross to bear.\" On November 2, 1946, Pierina was stricken by an intestinal occlusion and was again taken to the Civil Hospital in the  Montichiari. During the night of November 23\u201324, 1946, the Blessed Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose appeared to her again. Also, for the first time, the Madonna appeared, as described in Pierina's diary: \"Then I see the most beautiful Lady, as if transparent, dressed in purple with a white veil that descends from her head to her feet; she held her arms open, and I saw three swords piercing her heart.\" Our Lady did not speak to, nor converse with, Pierina at that time. A few months later, on March 12, 1947, after suffering heart failure followed by renal colic, Pierina had to be admitted again to the Civil Hospital of Montichiari, where she lost consciousness, She was assisted by her congregational sisters as well as by her mother and sisters, who feared that she might die. Again, Pierina convalesced slowly. During the month of May 1947, Pierina was subjected to diabolical vexations and would have a vision of Hell."

        "content": "In the summer of 1947, Pierina again witnessed apparitions of Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose, with daily visions of her from June 11 to July 12, 1947, as well as a second apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary with three swords piercing her Immaculate Heart. It was at 3:15 am on the night of 1 June 1947, during the recitation of the Rosary, when the Madonna said just three words to her: \"Preghiera, Sacrificio, Penitenza\" (Prayer, Sacrifice, Penance). Pierina recovered once more. Pierina had offered her sufferings for the sanctification of Roman Catholic consecrated souls (namely, for the priests and for members of male and female religious institutes, as listed in the Holy See's Pontifical Yearbook, in Italian, Annuario Pontificio). Then, on July 13, 1947, there occurred the first \"grand\" apparition. As noted in Pierina's diary, the Blessed Virgin Mary was accompanied by the Blessed Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose; and Our Lady appeared in a splendidly different manner: in a white dress and with a white cape around her head that reached to the floor; the three swords were on the floor, and on the chest of the Virgin were three roses: one white, one red, and one gold. She explained to Pierina, I am the Mother of Jesus and the Mother of all of you. Our Lord sends me to bring a new Marian devotion for all male and female institutes, religious orders, and secular priests. I promise those religious institutes, orders and secular priests who venerate me in this special way my special protection, an increase of spiritual vocations, few betrayed vocations, and great sanctity among the servants of God. I wish the 13th day of each month to be celebrated as the day of Mary. On the 12 preceding days, special prayers of preparation should be said. According to Pierina, Mary then explained to the meaning of the three swords and the three roses. The first sword means loss of the vocation as a priest or a monk. The second sword means priests, monks, and nuns who live in deadly sin. The third sword means priests and monks who while giving up their vocation, often lose also their faith, and become enemies of the Church. The white rose means the spirit of prayer. The red rose means the spirit of expiation and sacrifice. The yellow or golden rose means the spirit of penitence. Additionally, on these first thirteen days of every month, Mary asked for the prayerful observance of the following four long-standing Roman Catholic devotional practices: the Holy Mass, the Holy Communion, the Holy Rosary, and the Holy Hour of Eucharistic Adoration. Notable developments therefore took place on June 1 and July 13. The first development is that the initially silent Madonna (first appearing on the night of November 23\u201324, 1946) becomes the speaking Madonna (from 1 June 1947). The second is one of appearance: the sorrowful and tearful Madonna dressed in purple (reported by Pierina on the night of 23\u201324 November 1946 and again on 1 June 1947) gives way to the white-clad Rosa Mystica from 13 July 1947, when Mary appears in a white dress and long white cape, with three roses: white, red, and gold, adorning her Immaculate Heart. Later in that same year, on October 22, 1947, at 7:00 pm, while the Rosary was being recited by Pierina and others in the chapel of the Montichiari hospital of Pierina's religious order where she was serving as a nurse, Pierina saw a luminous ray of light emanating from the tabernacle to a nearby statue of Blessed Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose holding a crucifix. She saw the statue of Sister Mary and the figure on the Crucifix seemed to become animated; Pierina rose up and knelt in front of the statue, and, from the crucifix in its hands, were emerging drops of blood, which Pierina wiped dry with the purification cloth from the altar, as instructed by her holy foundress. The Blessed Sister Mary then spoke grievingly to Pierina: \"See how much blood is lost uselessly\"; and next the holy foundress pleadingly asked Pierina to recite the following prayer: \"My Jesus, mercy, pardon our sins.\" Then, Mary the Mystical Rose appeared, announcing her final visitation to the premises of the Handmaids of Charity, by saying to Pierina: For the last time I come to request the devotion already recommended at other times. My divine Son wanted to leave proof by his most precious Blood in order to witness how great is his love for all humanity, from which is returned such great offenses. Get the purification cloth, and show it to all here present. Behold, the drops of blood of the Lord. Let it be covered by a white cloth, and then let it be exposed for three days in this chapel, together alongside with the statute of Sister Mary Crucified of the Rose that will become miraculous for the sake of the devotion of the faithful. Have the coming factual test be referred to the Bishop, and say to him that conversions and revival of faith will verify it. I interpose myself as Mediatrix between all human beings and particularly for religious souls and my divine Son who, tired of the continuously received offenses, wanted to exercise His justice. I vitally desire that this Institute of the Handmaids of Charity may be the first to honor me with the title of Mystical Rose. After a silent pause, Mary the Mystical Rose stretched open her arms and white mantle as a gesture and a sign of her protection, revealing again the three roses upon her chest, and saying sweetly to Pierina: \"Live for the sake of love!\", as Our Lady slowly disappeared from sight. Latter 1947: Second Cycle of Marian Apparitions at Montichiari's Minor Basilica Successive apparitions of Mary the Mystical Rose would then occur to Pierina, while at the Duomo of Montichiari, a minor basilica, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary under her title as Saint Mary of the Assumption. According to Pierina, at the first such event in Montichiari's minor basilica of Saint Mary of the Assumption, on November 16, 1947, while Pierina was praying in thanksgiving after having attended the 7:00\u00a0a.m. Sunday Mass, it was near the altar in a wonderful light the Madonna appeared in the midst of a garden of white and red and golden roses. She asked Pierina to make, as an act of reparational humility, the sign of the Cross with her tongue on four tiles in the center of the basilica's floor. She requested prayer and sacrifice and penitence in reparation for the numerous offenses of humanity to the Lord. Pierina asked the Madonna if she would take her to heaven; Our Lady smiled and said to Pierina: \"If you can be generous, then many graces can be obtained for the whole world.\" Then, the Mystical Rose delicately joined together her hands in prayer, slowly turning away and distancing herself into a waning light. Next, during an interior locution to Pierina while praying in her hospital's chapel at mid-day on November 22, 1947, the Blessed Virgin Mary summoned her to meet at the Montichiari minor basilica at 4:00\u00a0p.m.; after conferring with her sister superior, Pierina, accompanied by five of her religious community's sisters, went to the basilica, where a few priests were already present. While they were reciting the Rosary, in a descending and increasingly luminous light Mary the Mystical Rose, surrounded by a tapestry of roses, appeared to Pierina, saying: \"I have come down to this place because here will be great conversions.\" Then, Our Lady specifically pre-announced that her upcoming visitation to this basilica would occur on December 8 the feast day of the Immaculate Conception, at 12:00 noon, in order to solemnly request the Hour of Grace. On Sunday, December 7, 1947, the eve of the feast of the Immaculate Conception, while Pierina was being visited by and conversing with some relatives at her hospital, she received an inner locution to come quickly to the Montichiari basilica. Taking leave of her relatives and going to her superior Mother Luigia Romanin, they proceeded to the basilica, along with Pierina's priest confessor Father Luigi Bonomini: they prayed the Miserere and were just beginning to recite the Rosary, when in a flash of light the Madonna appeared, beautiful and smiling, with two small angelic children (a boy clasping her right hand and a girl clasping her left hand, both dressed in shining white robes and headbands: they were identified as the Fatima children, by Mary the Mystical Rose). Our Lady spoke to Pierina Gilli, addressing her and her mother superior Luigia Romanin and her priest confessor Father Luigi Bonomini: \"I have come to bring graces and blessings to the three of you, for the work and sacrifices that you have done for my intentions.\" She confided some secrets to Pierina, and then with a penetrating glance said to her: \"Tomorrow at noon I shall come and show you a smallest part of Paradise. ... Tomorrow I will show you my Immaculate Heart, so little known by humanity. At Fatima I made known the devotion of consecration to my Heart. At Bonate I sought to make this penetrate into Christian families. Instead here at Montichiari I desire to deeply enkindle the Mystical Rose devotion; united with the devotion to my Heart, it comes profoundly into religious institutes, so that religious souls may draw abundant graces from my maternal Heart. With this apparition for the sanctification of religious souls, I close the cycle of such apparitions.\" Mary promised that she would continue to provide special graces for the Handmaids of Charity, and she also specifically requested prayers (as at Fatima) for the conversion of Russia, whose soldiers were affecting the tranquility and peace of Russia itself and of many nations, and particularly of Italy at that time. Thus, on December 7, 1947, accompanied by Jacinta and Francisco Marto, the two youngest of the three famous Marian visionary shepherd children of Fatima, Portugal, Mary had reappeared, explaining to the visionary Pierina as she wrote in her diary about these two heavenly children who were entrusted to her: \"They will be your companions in every tribulation. They also have suffered, although much younger than you.\" Pierina was discouraged and even pressured by numerous persons, including Monsignor Agostino Gazzoli, representing the Bishop of the Brescia diocese, from going to the Montichiari minor basilica at the time appointed (the noon hour of December 8, 1947) by the Blessed Virgin Mary. As the mid-day hour approached, Pierina, even though reproved and given injunctions by some authoritative ecclesiastical figures who tried mightily to dissuade her, decisively said, at 11:30\u00a0a.m. on December 8, 1947: \"Now it is necessary that I go.\" Pierina would have preferred to have been accompanied by her supportive mother and the sister superior of her hospital, but she hastily reached the destination on her own, arriving at Montichiari's minor basilica of Saint Mary of the Assumption, just at the noon hour. Mary appeared to Pierina in the Montichiari basilica, where about a thousand persons were attending Mass for the feast of the Immaculate Conception. Pierina sees Mary descending a wide staircase, beautifully lined with numerous white and red and gold roses, to the center of the basilica's floor; and she purportedly says to Pierina: \"I am the Immaculate Conception. I am Mary of Grace, the Mother of my Divine Son Jesus Christ. By my coming to the Clear Mountains (Montichiari), I desire to be called the Mystical Rose. Furthermore my desire is to see instituted the Hour of Grace for the whole world, by celebrating it on December 8th of every year, in order to obtain graces and conversions; and to request the construction of railings for the custody of these cited four floor tiles, together with a statue that replicates the Mystical Rose.\" And then, as Pierina saw the Madonna's Immaculate Heart, there allegedly occurred two miraculous cures, regarding a paralyzed child and a mute woman. These two healings involved: a young boy Ugo Senici about six years old, having suffered from polio and not being able to stand or to walk (who suddenly ran around and jumped up and down excitedly); and a 26-year-old woman Teresina Magli, having suffered for nine years from severe tuberculosis and not being able to speak even a word (who suddenly sang out a spontaneous song of praise in a loud voice). A third miraculous cure also happened during the same time as the other two, involving a mentally disturbed 36-year-old woman, Lauriana Zamboni, who was healed at home while her family members were praying for her inside Montichiari's minor basilica. After these episodes at Montichiari's minor basilica of Saint Mary of the Assumption, Pierina was soon investigated and closely interrogated by the diocesan ecclesiastical authorities. Subsequently, she secluded herself, at age 38 years, on May 20, 1949, at the convent of the Franciscan Sisters of the Holy Child in Brescia, Italy. She did not become a member of that religious order. Pierina stayed at this convent for 19 years, rendering her nursing services to this community of religious sisters, even though Pierina herself sometimes needed to be cared for. Pierina then found that the Marian apparitions occurred very rarely for a long time, but they were to return newly intensified in 1966."

        "content": "According to the testimony of Francesca (Franca) Dal Ri Cornado (1924\u20131993: foundress of the [Roman Catholic] Charismatic Movement of Assisi, in Brescia, Italy), the apparitions of Pierina were resumed as a requested sign, by their mutual spiritual director, Fr. Giustino Carpin, O.F.M.Conv., in order to verify the interior locutions that Franca Cornado had been receiving since 1958. Reportedly, Fr. Giustino had invited Franca, without entering into any details, to ask for an especial grace from the Lord \u2013 and the grace was exactly that his other spiritual daughter Pierina would see again the Madonna who had promised to newly manifest herself without specifying when and where. Over time, Fr. Giustino  and Pierina became close friends. On February 27, 1966, Mary indicated to Pierina, then being almost 55 years old, that on April 17, 1966, Whitsunday (White Sunday, \"domenica in albis\"), she would appear near a spring of water located at Fontanelle (in English, the Little Fountains), a small locality about three kilometers from the center of Montichiari, in the direction of Carpenedolo. The Madonna communicated the following message, pertaining to the small stairway leading down to the spring, as recorded in Pierina's diary: \"My Divine Son Jesus is all love. He has invited me to render miraculous this spring. As a sign of penance and of purification, give a kiss to the (top) step, then go down a few steps, stop, then give another kiss and go down further. For a third time, give again a kiss to the (bottom) step, and here can be placed the Crucifix. The sick and all my children, before taking and drinking the water, should ask pardon from my Divine Son.\" In a second apparition at Fontanelle, on May 13, 1966, the 49th anniversary of the first apparition of Our Lady of Fatima, Mary conveyed to Pierina to call the spring \"The Font of Grace\", inviting humanity to prayer, to sacrifice, and to penance. The third apparition happened on June 9, 1966. The Solemnity of Corpus Christi: the Blessed Virgin would express her desire according to which a part of the grain from the nearby fields would be transformed into \"the Eucharistic Bread\" and brought to Fatima on October 13. Moreover, she would express also her desire that the people of Montichiari would consecrate themselves to her Immaculate Heart. In the fourth and final apparition at Fontanelle, on August 6, 1966, the feast of the Transfiguration of Jesus, the Madonna would request the institution of \"the World Union of Reparative Communion\", to be held on October 13; additionally, her function as the mediatrix between her Son and humanity was recorded, by adjoining:\"I have chosen this place of Montichiari because in its children that work the soil, there is still humility as in a poor Bethlehem.\" Since then, at Fontanelle (the Little Fountains), there has been established the Sanctuary of Mary the Mystical Rose (in Italian, il Santuario di Maria Rosa Mistica), which is sometimes also referred to as \"the little Lourdes of Italy\" (in Italian, \"la piccola Lourdes italiana\"). Even the Blessed Virgin Mary, appearing as the Mystical Rose to Pierina Gilli, said on May 19, 1970:\"Montichiari can be a second Lourdes.\""

        "content": "Pierina began a very reclusive life from the late 1960s onwards, living simply and prayerfully in a donated little, humble house with a small prayer chapel, making herself available at her private home (in Montichiari's section or \"frazione\", called Boschetti, which in English means \"the little forests\"), to visitors coming on pilgrimage to Fontanelle (and to the Montichiari minor basilica. The last recorded Marian apparition occurred on March 24, 1983 to Pierina, being 71 years old, in her Boschetti home when Mary expressed her desire to see the realization of a special Marian Sanctuary with five cupolas in Montichiari, and specifically requested that progress be made in producing a Mystical Rose Sanctuary medal according to her instructions. Pierina Gilli, at the age of 79, died on January 12, 1991, at Montichiari, in the Boschetti section. After Pierina's death, during the 1990s and 2000s (decade), despite the local Brescia diocese's generally unsupportive historical stance, some 40 reported apparitions of Our Lady, a few times as the sorrowful Madonna, though mostly as Mary the Mystical Rose; as recorded in Pierina Gilli's diaries. The number of visitors coming to Fontanelle and Montichiari increased sufficiently that in 2001, two priests were assigned in regard to the spiritual care of the pilgrims. In relation to Montichiari and to Fontanelle, the spiritual conversions and the miraculous cures and the liberation from diabolical possessions are still continuing, accompanied by other supernatural signs, such as (for examples) solar prodigies and luminous crosses in the sky. Sociologist Bruno Massaro has researched the apparitions, and has written a book on his findings The Case of Pierina Gilli of Montichiari (2003). La Madre della Chiesa, Rosa Mistica: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: Le Anime, La Famiglia, La Chiese (The Mother of the Church, the Mystical Rose: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: The Souls, The Family, The Church), is a book compiled by Father Eligio Garbo, which informs mostly about the Montichiari apparitions."

        "title": "Pierina Gilli_Positions of the Roman Catholic Church",
        "content": "The following five pronouncements were made over the course of several decades by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brescia as cited by Kwvin Symonds and Alfredo Tradigo: Communicated by the Episcopal Curia on June 30, 1968: \"The Monsignor Bishop vividly exhorts all the faithful that they declare themselves respectful to the directives of the Church not to favor either by publications or by pilgrimages the spreading of devotions that are founded upon a non-approved interpretation of facts neither objectively controlled nor responsibly evaluated.\" Communicated by Monsignor Luigi Morstabilini on November 25, 1975: \"The Monsignor Bishop renews the firm invitation to the faithful and to the clergy because by their obsequious acceptance of preceding decisions they might find at other sanctuaries and places recognized by the Church the better form to experience the right and necessary devotion to the Mother of God according to more authentic contents of faith and of Catholic spirituality.\" Declaration of Monsignor Bruno Foresti on October 15, 1984: \"The Bishop of Brescia supported by the authoritative opinion of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, communicates that (a) the aforementioned apparitions of Our Lady the Mystical Rose in Montichiari do not present motives of credibility; (b) the cult relative to Our Lady the Mystical Rose, therefore, is not approved and can not be practiced nor favored; (c) whosoever favors it, by spreading publications or by organizing pilgrimages, does not help, but disturbs the faith of believers by inducing them to behave contrary to the disposition of the Church.\" Declaration of Monsignor Bruno Foresti on February 19, 1997: \"The Bishop of Brescia holding accountable some various solicitations that come continuously requested in merit, both from Italy and from external nations, reconfirms that which was disposed by him and by his predecessors.\" In the attachment to Decree number 229/08 by Monsignor Luciano Munari on March 19, 2008 at point 2 is read: \"In a particular way there is explicitly asked of individuals and of groups, that until now are more or less directly dedicated to promote the Marian cult in the Fontanelle locality, to respect all the indications of the Directory, and not to spread the messages or publications, neither to promote the acts of the cult, nor to send compositions that might even only indirectly induce the faithful to restrain both the judgment and the Church on the aforementioned apparitions or other extraordinary phenomena, even as may be modified in a positive sense.\" The Brescia diocesan bishops' have repeatedly clarified that the alleged apparitions have not been approved, and discouraged the premature promotion of the cultus, while at the same time making provision for the spiritual care of those who nonetheless go there. Bishop Giulio Sanguineti appointed on May 5, 2001, Monsignor Piero Boselli, Director of the Liturgical Office of the Diocesan Curia, as the Presider of a constituted Committee, \"with the purpose of watching over the devotional manifestations, while avoiding what might rest entrusted to the arbitrariness of occasional (casual) and passing-through priests\"; moreover, \"Responsible for the activities and for the judgment of Marian devotions is the diocesan Bishop only, in which the singular care directed on the part of the Diocese can avoid the possible multiplications of episodes tending to reinforce some simple convictions around presumed extraordinary phenomena. This responsibility is necessarily retained also to avoid slightly illuminated devotional practices and certain forms of tendentious preachings.\" In July 2013, the Diocese of Brescia again updated the Directory regulating worship at the apparition sites. In short, Our Lady can be honoured under the title Rosa Mystica because this is an ancient title of the Madonna; but no reference may be made during official activities to the alleged visions and their messages. In 2014, an official decree of the Diocese of Brescia erected the \"Foundation Rosa Mystica Fontanelle\" as the Church's official organisation to care for the property and activities at Fontanelle. It is noteworthy that the cycle of monthly and annual events include all the particular devotions (13th day of each month, and special activities on 13 July, 13 October and 8 December) which can be found in the alleged revelations. Paradoxically, although the new Foundation's mission is not to promote the alleged messages of Pierina Gilli, their website does offer a short summary which is necessary to explain why the shrine exists in the first place! On 7 December 2019, Bishop Tremolda (Bishop of Brescia since 2017) instituted an official sanctuary of Our Lady Rosa Mystica at the apparition site in Fontanelle. In a letter issued 21 November 2019, the new bishop recognises that many thousands of pilgrims have come to this place to honour Our Lady, and is cautiously optimistic that this is a healthy devotion for the Christian faithful. His letter acknowledges that judging the fruits of the devotion is as important as weighing up Pierina's claims in judging this spiritual phenomenon. He also mentions that there is a 'renewed phase' of investigation taking place, with the Diocese of Brescia and the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith continuing to evaluate the claims."

        "content": "Masuda was one of the major candidates who attributed credit for coining the term information society. Although his book that uses such terms in the title dates back to 1980, there was already a public debate on the issue in the 50 and 60 in Japan. Thus, some authors suggest that the first scholars of the concept of Information Society appear in Japan : the book published by Yoneji Masuda in 1980 titled Johoka shakai, which means the higher stage of social evolution, from the perspective of the analogy with biological evolution. From post-industrial society to information society. The fifth chapter of it was entitled to turn the information age: quiet transformation of society. In it, Masuda tells of the birth of an era of information, focusing on computer technology, which operates in conjunction with communications technology. An information age is the time period during which takes place innovation information technology, becomes latent force of social transformation, able to cause an expansion in the quality of information and a large increase scale storage of information. This was, for the author, the information society, focusing on computer technology, which would have a much more decisive impact on human society that the industrial revolution which began with the invention of the steam engine, because the fundamental role of the computer is to replace and amplify human mental work, while the basic function  of steam machinery was replacement and amplification of physical work. Masuda spoke also of the possibility of a highly organic society, pointing out the similarity of environmental information system of communications technology and computer information systems to organic bodies, which would suggest something important to the vision of the (then) future information society. On this basis, one could hypothesize that the future information society would be a highly integrated society, like an organism. It would be a complex multi-centered society in which many systems are connected and integrated by information networks. Further, this would be a dynamic society able to respond more quickly and appropriately to contemporary society-then-to the changing environment, and thus the information society of the future would appear to us as a society with a highly organic information space, linked by a network of cognitive information proaction dense mesh (feedforward). Writing about the social impact of the information age, Masuda understood to mean not only that would cause a great socioeconomic impact on contemporary industrial society, prove a force for social change powerful enough to transform human society into an absolutely new form, which is the information society. Overall, the innovative technology would change the social and economic systems through the following three phases: Phase 1. \u2013 In which technology does the work previously done for humans based on automation. Phase 2. \u2013 In which technology makes possible the realization of a work that man could never do before. Knowledge creation, leading to enlargement of the mental work of man. Phase 3. \u2013 In which socio-economic structures are transformed into new social and economic systems, a result of the first two phases of development. The futuristic vision of Masuda of goes further: in the global information society, all citizens will be bound together by a global network of information and knowledge, leading to the formation of a global consciousness, which will sweep away the differences of cultures, interests and nationalities. In predicting the introduction of a general education system, the disappearance of illiteracy, the advent of world peace and human happiness, Masuda does not restrict his futuristic vision to those social sectors or countries actively participating in industry or in services information, but predicts a real New World Order that he calls \"Computop\u00eda\""

Although popular artwork of the time consisted of heavy political agendas like those found in the Mexican Muralism Movement, Gironella did not participate in such agendas. On the contrary, Gironella rejected all art forms that intertwined with politics and became heavily influenced by surrealism and baroque portraiture. Shortly after discovering his painting style, Gironella was instrumental in the founding of the avant-garde art gallery, Galer\u00eda Prisse, along with fellow Mexican artist Vlady Kibalchich Rusakov and H\u00e9ctor Xavier. Galer\u00eda Prisse was a major factor in disturbing the political artworks of the time but this did not prevent Gironella from receiving criticism nor the questioning of his style. Gironella's artwork continues to be shared by his son, Emiliano Gironella, and was showcased in the plastic \"Forgetting Vel\u00e1zquez. The Meninas\" exhibition in Barcelona alongside his favorite artists Picasso, Vel\u00e1zquez, and Goya in 2008."

        "content": "Gironella was inspired by popular Surrealist artists in Mexico as well as many controversial artists of the Mexican Muralism movement such as David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera. Although surrealism differs drastically from the politically driven muralist movement, Gironella found that both distinct art forms resonated with his need to push creative boundaries. Even though he was a supporter and advocate of more liberal political views, Gironella's impressions of the Mexican Muralism movement led him to believe that art should not be political, rather, it should be representative of one's subconscious mind. By rejecting the politically influenced artistic styles, Gironella found himself captivated by the avant-garde art movement surrealism. Surrealism sought to create art that was representational of the capabilities of the unconscious mind, a polar opposite of the Mexican Muralism Movement. Gironella is said to contribute this fascination with the colorful avant-garde style to deeply rooted memories in his childhood. Recounting that some of his earliest memories being of himself assembling alters with chocolate rappers, vibrant tins, and bottles from the family owed grocery store. This specific inspiration is said to derive from his love of Leonora Carrington's surrealism that was introduced to the new world in the 1940s, as well as his friendship with the film maker Luis Bunuel. Having immersed himself in surrealism, Gironella's artwork caught the attention of the popular French Surrealist artist Andre Breton. During Gironella's first solo exhibition in Paris in 1961, Breton was described to have been enthralled by the artwork, claiming that Gironella's passion and work were proof that surrealism was still alive and strong within the art community. It is important to note, however, that Gironella did not perceive himself solely as a surrealist artist, claiming that he was just as much a baroque artist and labels were not necessary. The fact that not even Gironella himself could pinpoint his exact style could perhaps be said to have been a precursor to future art admirers also not being able to categorize his work. Nonetheless, Gironella's artwork has left a lasting impression on many artist and admirers around the world"

Gironella referred to this combination of artistic approaches as \"mestizo,\" a mix between Indigenous and European influences. Primarily focused on Spanish Baroque paintings of the 16th and 17th century, specifically court portraiture, many artists of his time found it difficult to categorize Gironella as a Mexican Surrealist, instead being dismissed as an \"international artist\" by the Mexican art historian Ida Rodr\u00edguez Prampolini. It is important to note that surrealism is not the only artistic style that Gironella used, Baroque style also influenced him in which led him to use renowned artistic works of Spaniard origin and rework them into his own style while incorporating surrealism."

The colonial approach is said to have been influenced by his favorite artist such as Francisco Goya, El Greco, and Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, all of whom were alive during the colonization of Mexico. Despite the fact that many did not perceive Gironella as an authentic Mexican artist, Gironella frequently pushed back on this perspective because to deny the effect of Spaniard and European influences on Mexico would be to disembody Mexico's cultural identity entirely."

Initially, Qingan temple was a language school which was built by the Dutch East India Company. However, this school was converted into a shrine for Wenchang Dijun (\u6587\u660c\u5e1d\u541b) who is the god of education, and after that Qingan temple was built on this shrine. In particular, on the second floor, there is an icon of Shen Guangwen as the sixth facet of Wenchang Dijun owing to his educational contribution in the exhibition room. Moreover, there is some background information displayed in relation to him. As other memorial places of Shen Guangwen in Shanhua, there are Shen Guangwen memorials at Zhongshan Road, Guangwen Road, and the Guangwen Building at Shanhua Junior High School."

        "content": "Igwe was influenced to become a humanist activist through the writings of Paul Kurtz, which he read in magazines published by the Center for Inquiry. Igwe is listed as a Junior Fellow for the Bayreuth International Graduate School of African Studies, where his project is a case study of witchcraft accusation in northern Ghana. In a fall 2000 article in the quarterly journal Free Inquiry, Igwe enumerated different ways in which religious extremists in Nigeria have co-opted the local government and used it to enforce religious codes of law, hindering the upholding of human rights in those areas. Igwe wrote in 2004 that in his own country of Nigeria, contemporary belief in witchcraft leads to ritual killing and human sacrifice, noting that women and children are more likely to be said to possess or practice \"negative\" witchcraft abilities, while men are more often depicted as possessing benign witchcraft abilities. In 2008, a BBC documentary, Saving Africa's Witch Children, featured an appearance by Igwe, as one of the primary subjects was \"witch hunter Helen Ukpabio.\" The documentary detailed reported \"terrible crimes committed against children accused of witchcraft,\" and premiered as an HBO feature in 2010. The film also follows the efforts of Sam Itauma, a human rights activist and founder of the Child Rights and Rehabilitation Network (CRARN), who offers shelter and protection to children who have been abused or abandoned, and Gary Foxcroft, who founded Stepping Stones Nigeria, a UK-registered charity. In 2009, Igwe represented the International Humanist and Ethical Union at the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights in Banjul, Gambia, where he spoke out on the IHEU's behalf against caste-based discrimination in Africa. In his talk, Igwe brought attention to discrimination against the Osu, a group of people perceived by some to be of lower class, who Igwe says \"continue to suffer discrimination and indignity, particularly in the areas of marriage and family, right to own property and inheritance, access to land, political rights and representation, education, development, infrastructure, and distribution of basic amenities.\" In 2010, according to a release by the European Humanist Federation (EHF), Igwe's home was invaded by soldiers and police officers \"following a fictitious murder charge,\" which was allegedly brought on by a man that Igwe had attempted to have prosecuted for allegedly committing sexual crimes against a 10-year-old girl in 2006. According to the report, Igwe had been arrested three times since beginning work on the rape case, as a result of allegedly malicious petitions, prompting David Pollock of the EHF to write to then vice-president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, on Igwe's behalf. According to the EHF, later in August 2010, Igwe's home and family were attacked when two unidentified men assaulted and blindfolded Igwe's father, causing \"extensive injuries to his face and head,\" and resulting in the elder Igwe having to have his eye surgically removed. The case has been taken up by Amnesty International after police reportedly refused to open an investigation. On 11 January 2011, while attempting to rescue two children who were victims of witchcraft accusation in Uyo Akwa State in southern Nigeria, Igwe was \"imprisoned and beaten by police,\" in an effort, according to Sahara Reporters, by the state governor Godswill Akpabio, to begin \"clamping down on activists involved in the rescue of children accused of witchcraft.\" Igwe was later released without charge, according to Gary Foxcroft of Stepping Stones Nigeria, and \"in good spirits.\" On 11 February 2014, Igwe was chosen as a laureate of the International Academy of Humanism. In 2017, he was given the Distinguished Services to Humanism Award from the International Humanist and Ethical Union General Assembly. Upon receiving the award, Igwe dedicated it \"to all humanists at risk around the globe\". Igwe is an outspoken supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations. When discussing the matter, Igwe has argued that \"the United Nations needs to be handed back to those to whom it actually belongs - the people of the world.\" Igwe continues to speak out against attacks on alleged witches in Malawi. According to him, recent cases of such attacks in December 2019 and January 2020 \"...contained seeds of an effective advocacy against witch persecution in Malawi. First of all there is an urgent need for advocates for alleged witches throughout the country to become more visible and proactive.\" He proposes that, in addition to widespread education about the real causes of misfortune, \"There should be heavy penalties including suspension and summary dismissal for the head of any village, or district where an alleged witch is attacked or killed.\""

After the attack, the leader of Liberty Gospel Church, pastor Helen Ukpabio, sued the state government, as well as several critics, including Igwe, seeking 2 billion naira (about US$13 million, 2010) and an \"order of perpetual injunction,\" restraining her critics' speech from further criticizing her work. Ukpabio's application was later dismissed by Justice P.J. Nneke at the Federal High Court in Calabar. Responding to criticism by Igwe and other activists, Ukpabio told The New York Times reporter Mark Oppenheimer that \"her filmic depictions of possessed children, gathering by moonlight to devour human flesh\" (as seen in her film End of the Wicked) were not meant to be taken literally, and stated, according to Oppenheimer, that the BBC documentary Saving Africa's Children \"exaggerates or invents the problem of child abandonment.\" According to Oppenheimer, \"Asked how she could be so sure, she said, 'because I am an African!' In Africa, she said, 'family ties are too strong to have a child on the street.'\""

In addition to founding the Nigerian Humanist Movement, Igwe was also a main organizer and presenter in 2007 at the first international humanist conference in Sub-Saharan Africa. Igwe has also served on the board of directors of Atheist Alliance International, where he facilitated collaboration between AAI and the Nigerian Humanist Movement, resulting in the NHM receiving both the AAI International Freidenker Award and the AAI Community Cooperation Award. In June 2009, as director of the Center For Inquiry\u2013Nigeria, Igwe was interviewed on the BBC World Service about the center's efforts to raise awareness about violence and neglect resulting from witchcraft belief, both in the name of its practice and resulting from fear of magic. In 2012, Igwe wrote A Manifesto for a Skeptical Africa, which received endorsements from multiple public activists in Africa, as well as skeptical endorsers around the world. Igwe presented a poster at the Sixth World Skeptics Congress (18\u201320 May 2012) in Berlin, Germany, with graphic accounts of the trials that he and many of his supporters have faced in Africa while protesting the persecution and killing of children and minorities, and the failures on the part of law enforcement and religious leaders to challenge such atrocities. On 12 July 2012, Igwe participated in a panel discussion at The Amaz!ng Meeting (TAM), \"From Witch-burning to God-men: Supporting Skepticism Around the World.\" Igwe's presentation addressed the issue of poverty driving both the supply of and demand for self-styled exorcists, which preys on desperate communities and results in the abandonment or neglect of children. With panelist Eran Segev (then-President, Australian Skeptics) and moderator Brian Thompson (Outreach Director, JREF), Igwe discussed his efforts in human rights advocacy and the deleterious effects of superstition and witchcraft accusation in Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi. In October 2012, Igwe was appointed as a Research Fellow of the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF), a skeptical nonprofit organization founded by magician and skeptic James Randi. Randi said of the appointment, \"We at the JREF are proud to work with Mr. Leo Igwe in fighting deadly misinformation in Africa, and around the world,\" adding that the JREF's mission \"fits in perfectly with Mr. Igwe's very important work.\" In 2013, Igwe presented a speech at the London Black Atheists meeting entitled 'Breaking The Taboo of Atheism in Black Communities', in which he said \"God has not turned up! Black people should speak out because we suffer most from religious excesses\". In 2017, Igwe attended the seventeenth European Skeptics Congress (ESC). Here, he spoke on the topics of science and religion. He attended a panel discussion with Petr Jan Vin\u0161, a priest from the Old Catholic Church, who spoke about bringing more critical thinking to religion. Igwe was \"sternly polite with his comments about not talking down to religious people and embracing science.\" In a 2017 Ted Talk on humanism, Igwe shared how the example of his parents' hard work inspired him to adopt a philosophy that emphasizes human agency in his approach to challenges like poverty, disease, and superstition. \"In some cases, religion drives many Africans to extraordinary length: to attack other human beings, to commit ritual killing, targeting those living with albinism, those with a humpback, and as I recently learned, those with a bald head. In Africa, superstition is widespread, with so many people believing in witchcraft, something that has no basis in reason or in science. Yet alleged witches, usually women, children and elderly persons are still routinely attacked, banished and killed. And I've made it part of my life's mission to end witchcraft accusation and witch persecution in Africa.\""

Each of the three tests are heavily biased against the accused and include the use of the randomness of nature (chickens or crocodiles) or the laws of physics (brooms). The chicken test involves the candidate providing a few chickens to a diviner. The diviner ceremoniously beheads the chickens and watches how the decapitated animals fall. If the chickens land facing the sky, the suspect is innocent; but if they fall facing the ground, the accused is guilty. The crocodile test is a simple one in which the accused is thrown into a river in which crocodiles are known to live. The suspect is guilty if attacked and eaten. This test is supposedly no longer in use. Igwe suspects that this may be due to over-hunting of crocodiles in the locations where the tests were performed. The broom test uses the laws of physics to put the accused at a distinct disadvantage. The suspect is seated upon a small seat which provides very little support or balance. After some ritual actions, the bristle ends of two brooms are pushed against the front of the suspect's neck. If the brooms separate, or rather if the potential witch is able to remain upright, then the suspect is innocent. If the brooms do not separate and the accused is pushed from the seat, the suspect is guilty."

Igwe labels the five doubts as \"individual doubt, inspire doubt, inculcate doubt, inform doubt, and Internet doubt.\" \"Individual doubt\" labels one's personal questions based upon one's experience with a given subject. \"Inspire doubt\" refers to commending those who employ critical thinking and express doubts instead of freely accepting information as factual. \"Inculcate doubt\" highlights that while many people doubt naturally, critical thinking needs to be taught, preferably from a young age. \"Inform doubt\" identifies the need to express our critical thoughts in order to circulate them and encourage others to do the same. Finally, \"Internet doubt\" displays a way to prompt further critical thinking by posing questions and receiving more questions in response."

On 23 June 2021, he held his first workshop at Funmade Nursery and Primary School in Oyo State, southwest Nigeria. On 1 July, he presented the case for critical thinking in primary schools to fifty teachers in the Ibadan local government area of Nigeria. This was the first teacher training on critical thinking for primary schools in the state. According to Igwe, the African school system needs a paradigm shift and a radical change in the culture of teaching and learning for pupils. The teaching of critical thinking, he said, is intended to stimulate this change and spark an intellectual awakening and renaissance in schools."

Michelle Dorr, a six-year-old friend of his niece, came over looking for her. Clark took her up to an upstairs room and stabbed Michelle to death. Clark then drank some of her blood and stuffed her in a duffel bag. He buried her in a park 12 miles away. On October 18, 1992, he killed 23-year-old Laura Houghteling in Bethesda, Maryland. Clark was working as a gardener for Laura's mother Penny when she accused Hadden of stealing tools from her backyard shed. Clark entered the house through the back door and stabbed Laura to death in her bedroom with a kitchen knife and suffocated her with a pillow. He carried her body in a bedsheet through a wooded area and buried her a half-mile away. He left behind a pillow with his fingerprint as he moved the body. He later returned and dressed up in a wig and women's clothes and left through the front door to make people think Laura left the house alive to buy time to clean the scene. Police soon discovered the bloody pillow and linked the print on it to Clark. Clark confessed and led police to Laura's body eight months after the murder. Police began looking at him for Michelle Dorr's murder after discovering he lived two houses down from Michelle's father at the time she disappeared. Police later tested his brother's old house for blood and found Michelle's blood in the wooden floorboards of an upstairs bedroom. Clark later led police to her body in January 2000."

He attended Chatswood Primary School, Mosman High School and Gore Hill Technical College. He trained as a master builder, and later opened TS Hynd Pty Ltd, a business specialising in electronic doors. He was a prominent business figure on the Gold Coast, and Alex Douglas claimed that \"he installed probably half of the roller doors on houses that were built\". He was actively involved in the National Party, and had been the vice-president of its south-east zone. Hynd was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1986 state election for Nerang, a new electorate created with the enlargement of parliament that year. Hynd was an enthusiastic supporter of Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and endorsed his Joh for Canberra campaign, having been quoted in 1987 as stating: \"It would be the greatest thing ever to happen to Australia if Joh was to be Prime Minister . . . He is just the man to lead this country out of the wilderness. I would walk from here to George Street for Joh to be PM.\" One issue which Hynd took up in parliament with lasting effect was the cause of those living in caravan parks, as he first issued a green paper outlining issues in the area, and then successfully introduced legislation to protect their rights.  He was promoted to Deputy Government Whip in September 1989, two months before the 1989 state election. He was defeated at that election by Liberal candidate Ray Connor, and did not run for office again. In retirement, he was actively involved in the Rotary Club, and made wooden toys and sold them at markets in order to raise money for charity. He died on the Gold Coast on 20 October 2011."

After spending time in Greenwich Village, he moved to Provincetown, Massachusetts in the late 1920s with his parents Ma and \"Pa\" (Edward C.) Hunt.  Pa Hunt began painting in 1929, and his na\u00efve art oil painting Peter Hunt's Antique Shop, 1930-34 was acquired by the MOMA in 1941. In the 1930s, Hunt expanded his business to include several storefronts and workshop space called \"Peter Hunt's Peasant Village.\" He painted old furniture, household items, and fabrics, decorating them with colorful peasant designs, reminiscent of Pennsylvania German and French Provincial folk art. Hearts, flowers, fruits, birds, angels, and pretty maidens and their suitors adorned hutches, cabinets, dressers, tables, chairs, stools, wooden trays, fabrics, tins, and metalware. Hunt further embellished some of those pieces with pseudo-French phrases scrawled across their surfaces. With his artistic talent, good looks, charm, wit, and knack for outrageous storytelling, Hunt wooed and delighted wealthy matrons and high-society tastemakers vacationing on Cape Cod. They found him irresistible, and his cheerful designs the perfect look for their summer cottages. Hunt\u2019s clients were rich and influential; among them were Boston socialite Frances Brown Merkel and New York cosmetics diva Helena Rubinstein, both of whom helped advance Peter Hunt\u2019s name and reputation. He employed young artists to decorate pieces in his signature style, and upscale New York department stores began carrying his furniture and knickknacks. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Hunt\u2019s star shone brightly. \" Peter designed the \"Cape Cod Room\" restaurant of Chicago's Drake Hotel in 1935, bringing Cape Cod artifacts and painting murals of the sea. His gained popularity in the 1930s and 1940s when he encouraged women to re-make furniture during the economically challenging times of the Great Depression and World War II.  His Peter Hunt's Workbook was published in 1945 by Ziff-Davis Publishing Company.  In the 1950s interest in the peasant style waned, and Hunt sold his Peasant Village shops and moved to Orleans, Cape Cod where he opened a shop called Peacock Alley.  Peter Hunt died almost penniless in 1967. Today Hunt's works are collectible and sell at auction for up to thousands of dollars.  LaGina Austin, an American folk art specialist, described as work as \"folksy and attractive to kitschy almost corny.\" To recognize a Hunt original, collectors should luck for his rounded cursive signature \"Peter Hunt\" or \"anno Domini\" with the year.  He always used bright colors in styles that looked like European and Pennsylvania Dutch folk art."

        "content": "Rinaldo's birth and death dates are unknown. We know that he was born in Mantua, and he was among those charged with decorating the Palazzo del Te in Mantua. In this work he assisted with the Sala dei Venti, the Camera delle Aquile (1527) and the Loggia di David (1531). During part of 1531 he is  documented as collaborating with Giulio Romano in decoration of the Castello di San Giorgio of Mantua. From 1532 to 1536 he participated in executing the frescoes in the Sala dei Giganti, where we see his somewhat flat and decorative style of painting on a large part of the ceilings and walls. From 1536 to 1539 he was part of the group of artists who decorated the Ducal Palace of Mantua. There he worked on the Appartamento di Troia and Camerino dei Falconi. Working alone, but following his master designs, he painted the frescoes in the Boschetti chapel of San Andrea de Mantua. In this work there is again a tendency to flatten and compress the figures, eliminating any sense of spatial perspective. He is also attributed, though with doubts, to the decoration of the Chapel of St. Sebastian in the same church in Mantua. His works show great promise, but his career was cut short by a premature death. A Triumph of Julius Cesar by him was found in Vienna, and pictures in the National Gallery, The Capture of Carthage and Continence of Scipio, and the Rape of the Sabine Women, with the subsequent Reconciliation between the Romans and Sabines, have been ascribed Rinaldo instead of Romano."

He competed in the BOC Challenge and the Vend\u00e9e Globe, a single-handed non-stop race around the world. After five years of single-handed sailing, he logged over 100,000 miles at sea and set the record for the fastest solo circumnavigation by an American, with a time of 135 days. In 1992, Plant was preparing to compete in his second Vend\u00e9e Globe and fourth single-handed circumnavigation aboard Coyote, a powerful Open 60 sloop, and was lost at sea while delivering Coyote from New York Harbor to Les Sables-d'Olonne, France for the starting line.  Coyote was found 32 days later, turtled, without the 8,400 lb lead bulb that should have been attached to the keel. At the time of his death, Plant was one of only five people to have completed three solo circumnavigations, joining Bertie Reed, Guy Bernardin, Jean-Luc Van Den Heede and Philippe Jeantot. On September 6, 2002, Plant was inducted into The Single-Handed Sailing Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island. Mike Plant was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on November 21, 1950, the third of Frank Plant Jr. and Mary Kennedy's five children. He spent his childhood in the Minneapolis suburb of Deephaven on the shores of Lake Minnetonka. At the age of 9, Plant began sailing X Boats at Minnetonka Yacht Club, and by the age of 14, aboard Lucky Strike, had twice won the Interlake Regatta, the biggest regatta in the area, in which the top five boats from each of the large lakes in Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin competed at the end of the summer. After many adventures in his 20s, including trekking the length of South America (12,000 miles), Plant moved to Jamestown, Rhode Island, where he would later find his passion for single-handed sailing."

Although eliminated from the race after receiving help to rescue his boat after it ran aground in Perseverance Harbour at Campbell Island, New Zealand, Plant still set a record for the fastest American to sail single-handed around the world with a time of 135 days, bettering Dodge Morgan's time of 150 days set in 1985 aboard his 60-foot cutter, American Promise. Plant's disqualification from the 1989 Vend\u00e9e Globe transpired when a $5 part on Duracell's rigging was damaged in the Pacific Ocean. Plant sailed 36 hours straight until he was able to anchor in Perseverance Harbour at Campbell Island, New Zealand. Once anchored, a storm caught him and began pushing Duracell toward a rocky shore\u2019s certain destruction. On the island, four meteorologists saw the racer\u2019s plight and motored out in their boat as the windspeed slowly increased. To save his boat with its dragging anchor, Plant had to accept the tow, but he knew that the outside assistance would disqualify him. The meteorologists suggested to Mike that he simply continue the race. They vowed eternal silence. No one would know. \"Except I would,\" Mike answered. Plant radioed the race committee that he had accepted outside help and that he would continue the race, though disqualified. He unofficially crossed the finish line in seventh place. Mike lost the race, but to the admiring French, he emerged a real hero. His determination and honesty did not go unnoticed: 25,000 people lined the breakwater in Les Sables-d'Olonne to give him a rousing hero\u2019s welcome. Mike was the only American in the race. Herb McCormick, editor of Cruising World, and the Boating Editor of the New York Times wrote: \"The tens of thousands of French men and women who greeted him at the finish understood something that largely was missed in this country. By forging on, by completing what he\u2019d set out to do, by showing the highest respect for his competitors in a wonderful act of sportsmanship, Mike was as much a winner as the sailors who\u2019d officially crossed the finish line.\" Plant's record as the fastest American to sail single-handed around the world stood until the 1994/95 BOC Challenge when Steve Pettengill, sailing Hunter's Child, bested the time with a circumnavigation in 128 days. Bruce Schwab later broke this record, finishing the 2005 Vend\u00e9e Globe with a time of 109 days nonstop. 1990/1991: Finished 4th overall in the BOC Challenge, setting the highest mark in a solo-sailing event for an American.

Around 1917, Edith moved with her parents and nine older brothers and sisters to their brand-new house at 25th and Diamond Streets. Directly across Diamond Street, there was a large park with a baseball diamond. When the field was free, the kids in the neighborhood would start a game of baseball. The first position Edith played was shortstop. Her father, William L. Houghton, distributed goods for a large grocery company. He was also a skilled baseball player who taught his youngest daughter many techniques. As young as age six, Edith posed for photos in a baseball uniform. By the time she was eight, she dressed as the mascot for the Philadelphia police's baseball team. Family, friends, and fans dubbed Edith \u201cThe Kid.\u201d Too young to join a factory team, in 1922 the ten-year-old Edith tried out for the Philadelphia Bobbies, a semi-pro team for non-working girls. Houghton quickly became the star, her fielding and batting skills drew the attention of fans and reporters, as did her youth. Edith was the youngest on a team made up of mostly teenage girls. The Bobbies practiced in Fairmount Park, where Edith was a standout athlete and baseball player. In 1925, she and the team travelled to Japan to play baseball against men; Houghton was then 13 years old. On September 23, 1925, they boarded a train at the North Broad Street Station, several blocks from Edith's house. Twelve Bobbies, their coach, and two men (to play pitcher and catcher) played eight games on their way to Seattle, en route to Yokohama. Once in Japan, they drew large crowds, especially at first. Edith impressed many Japanese reporters. Although they were contracted to play 15 games for $800, their finances fell through midway through the trip. Half the team headed to Formosa and back to the United States. The other half, including Edith, stayed in Kobe and luckily found a contributor to fund their trip home by December."

Houghton later played with other women's pro teams such as the Hollywood Girls and the New York Bloomer Girls. In 1942, during World War II, she volunteered for the WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Services). Although nominally a clerk, she was accepted into the department's baseball team. The Navy newsletter wrote that \"enlisted WAVE Houghton... can make any ball team in the country.\" During her service, she was assigned to the procurement of WAVES and Navy Nurse clothing for the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts in Washington D.C. Houghton eventually became chief storekeeper. In December 1944, Houghton's unit was transferred to New York. In 1945, Houghton was discharged from the WAVES but was recruited again and became the Chief Master of Arms. After the war, she took her skills to a new level. She approached Phillies\u2019 owner R. R. M. Carpenter Jr. in 1946 asking for an interview, then met with Carpenter and general manager Herb Pennock. Soon the Phillies made national news: they hired Houghton as Major League Baseball's first female scout. From 1946 to 1952, she scouted players and signed fifteen to contracts, mostly from Philadelphia-area high schools. She left the team in 1952 and rejoined the Navy, where she served during the Korean and Vietnam wars and retired as a chief petty officer. In 1964, Houghton left Philadelphia and moved to Sarasota, Florida, where she lived until her death on February 2, 2013, eight days before her 101st birthday."

In 1680 he moved to Amsterdam, where he soon became involved in the intellectual life of the city. In 1682 he came into contact with the works and the followers of Baruch Spinoza, whose ideas he did not share. He refuted them in his book  't Mom-Aensicht Der Atheistery Afgerukt, \"The mask of atheism torn off\", published in 1683. His Inleiding tot de Christelyke Gods-geleertheid, \"Introduction to Christian theology\", published in 1698, examines the relationship between scientific method and theology, and lays out his belief that religious differences could be resolved by a scientific approach. In 1707 Verwer published his Linguae Belgicae Idea, grammatica, poetica, rhetorica; deprompta ex adversariis Anonymi Batavi: in usum proximi amici (\"Grammar, poetry and rhetoric of the Belgian language, from the notes of an anonymous Dutchman, for the use of a close friend\"), in which he criticises the Nederduitsche spraekkunst of Arnold Moonen, published in the previous year and based on the work of earlier writers such as Joost van den Vondel. Between 1708 and 1710 Verwer defended the position he had taken in the work in a number of open letters. His work was an important influence on two Dutch linguists, his friend Lambert ten Kate (1674\u20131731), and Balthazar Huydecoper (1695\u20131778). Like Verwer, ten Kate was a Mennonite merchant; his Gemeenschap tussen de Gottische Spraeke en de Nederduytsche, \"Relationship between the Gothic language and Dutch\", published in 1710, was written at Verwer's request, and consists in part of a letter to \"A.V.\", i.e., Adriaen Verwer. Verwer sent a presentation copy of this work to Adriaan Reland, professor at the University of Utrecht. Verwer's work on maritime law, Nederlants see-rechten, avaryen, en bodemeryen, \"Dutch maritime law, damages, and loans\", was published in 1711. It was his most successful book and was reprinted in 1716, in 1730 and in 1764. Verwer took a keen amateur interest in mathematics, and particularly admired Isaac Newton. His copy of the first edition of the Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica (1687), extensively annotated in his hand, is preserved in the Universiteitsbibliotheek Utrecht. Adriaen Verwer died in Amsterdam on 31 March 1717."

After taking care of the cinematography of the second unit for the peplum film Romulus and Remus (1961) by Sergio Corbucci, he began his career as cinematographer with two other peplum films, both directed by Alberto De Martino, Due contro tutti (1962) and Perseo l'invincibile (1963). In mid-1960s, he started working in more significant films, such as Un uomo a met\u00e0 by Vittorio De Seta and Le stagioni del nostro amore by Florestano Vancini. Di Palma later reached the peak of his career in the 1970s, when he signed the cinematography of notable titles such as Lina Wertm\u00fcller's The Seduction of Mimi, Valerio Zurlini's Indian Summer and Ettore Scola's Ugly, Dirty and Bad. The tragic suicide of his son, who had been his assistant on the set of the Scola's film, sank him into a depression and away from work. Later Di Palma never returned to major productions, working mainly for Italian television and prematurely ending his career at the beginning of the nineties."

Here he became a close ally of the Land's Advocate of Holland, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. Vrancke was very much opposed to the attempts of the States-General of the Netherlands to procure a new sovereign, after the departure of the Duke of Anjou. When the Treaty of Nonsuch nevertheless introduced a kind of English protectorate over the budding republic, with the arrival of the Earl of Leicester and English representatives on the Council of State of the Netherlands, Vrancke became one of the fiercest opponents of English influence and policies.

        "content": "In 1587 one of the English members of the Council of State, Thomas Wilkes, launched an attack on the pretensions of the Regenten to sovereignty with a \"Remonstrance\" to the States of Holland, asserting that \"by default of a legal prince\" sovereignty belonged to the People, and not to Regenten who at best represented that People. Such an attack on their legitimacy could not be left unchallenged by the States, who commissioned Vranck to write a blistering reply, which he did in the form of his Deduction (with the very long name). This pamphlet took the form of a historical dissertation, going back 800 years to the mythical origins of the county of Holland and its political institutions, and \"proving\" that since time immemorial sovereignty had resided in the vroedschappen and nobility, and that it was administered by (not transferred to) the States, next to the Count of Holland (whose place had recently been declared vacant by the Act of Abjuration). In other words, in this view the republic already existed so it did not need to be brought into being. Vranck's conclusions reflected the view of the States at that time and would form the basis of the ideology of the States-Party faction in Dutch politics, in their defense against the \"monarchical\" views of their hard-line Calvinist and Orangist enemies in future decades. This dissertation was received with great enthusiasm by the States, who later had it entered in the Groot Placaetboeck (codex of Dutch laws). It formed the basis of constitutional expositions by Hugo Grotius (Liber de antiquitate reipublicae Batavicae; On the Antiquity of the Batavian Republic, 1610) and Simon van Slingelandt. The States were so enamored of Vranck that they offered him the post of deputy-Land's Advocate, under Van Oldenbarnevelt, but he had to decline, because the city of Gouda refused to let him go. However, two years later, in 1589, his contract as Pensionary was not renewed."

        "content": "After his dismissal by Gouda Vranck again took up his law practice in The Hague. In 1590 he represented the cities of Gouda and Haarlem in an important lawsuit against the city of Rotterdam about a dam (the Hildam) in the Rotte river. In 1592 he was appointed a justice in the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland (Supreme Court of the provinces of Holland and Zeeland). In this capacity Vrancke was sent as an intermediary by the States-General in 1597 to resolve a conflict between the city of Groningen and its Ommelanden. Meanwhile, he had declined an offer by the States of Utrecht to succeed Floris Thin as pensionary, and a similar offer of the city of Leiden. In the period after 1592 relations between Vranck and Oldenbarnevelt cooled, as they were opposed on important policy questions. Vranck, together with Willem Usselincx, was very much in favor of giving the proposed Dutch West India Company (W.I.C.) in the years leading up to the Twelve Years' Truce a similar status as the Dutch East India Company, because he expected the new company to cause the Spanish Empire, with which the Republic was fighting the Eighty Years' War, much harm in its American possessions. As Oldenbarnevelt knew that for that reason a truce would become impossible if the plans for founding the company proceeded, he frustrated the plans of Vranck and Usselincx for the W.I.C. Later Vranck opposed the Erastian stance of Oldenbarnevelt and Grotius in the conflict with the Contra-Remonstrants, which he thought too extreme. He was no Contra-Remonstrant himself, though, as witnessed by his tolerant stance in religious matters expressed in the polemical Wederlegghinge (Refutation) that he wrote against a pamphlet by Franciscus Haraeus'  (Impartial explanation of the causes of the war in the Netherlands), in itself a reaction to the work of Grotius (which in turn was based on Vranck's own work)."

In 1938, after completing her high school education, she was denied access to Italy's university system due to the promulgation of the Fascist Racial Laws. She moved to Switzerland first and then in 1939 to the United States. In the United States she was allowed to enter Yale University's graduate program and completed it in record time. In 1943, at the age of 21, Cavaglieri received her Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry. The same year she married Victor Tesoro, with whom she had two children. Following her marriage, Giuliana Cavaglieri Tesoro worked summers for Calico Chemical Company before accepting a position as research chemist at Onyx Oil and Chemical Company in 1944. Here she was promoted to head of the organic synthesis department in 1946, assistant director of research in 1955, and associate director in 1957. She was then appointed assistant director of organic research for J.P. Stevens & Company. Late she moved to the Textile Research Institute for two years. In 1969, she accepted a position as senior chemist at Burlington Industries and was appointed director of chemical research in 1971. In 1972 she accepted a post as Visiting Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she taught until 1976, remaining on the Faculty as adjunct professor and senior research scientist until 1982. She was then appointed research professor at Polytechnic Institute of New York University in Brooklyn, New York in 1982 and retired from there in 1996.

All members of his family were killed during the Holocaust. He finished elementary and high school in Sarajevo. Focht graduated from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb, after which he returned to Sarajevo where he was elected assistant at the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Sarajevo. Shortly after he moved back to Zagreb where he lived for the rest of his life, until his death. Focht was philosopher of phenomenological orientation, who in the early works departed from the Marxist and psychological interpretations of art. Music is in his texts had ontological priority over all other arts. In the art of music, particularly that of Bach, Focht tried to uncover the importance of achieving pythagorean music. Bach's music, as interpreted by Focht, is not a mere reflection of the subject, nor a reflection of social reality, just as it is not an expression of human feelings, but the secret of life organized and tuned to the cosmic laws. Focht, beside the aesthetics, has published several important books about mushrooms. He was also one of the first thinkers and critics of science fiction in Croatia, considering that our age is the time of death of philosophy, or age of science and science fiction. Focht died in Zagreb on October 20, 1992, and was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery."

In 1830, he moved to Paris, entered the Conservatory and there followed a course in harmony. After some time studying counterpoint and fugue under Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis, and composition under Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Le Sueur, whose second daughter, Louise Eug\u00e9nie F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Lesueur (1808\u20131884), he would marry on 17 October 1833, he won second prize in 1834 and the Prix de Rome in 1836 for his cantata Velleda, which was performed at the Conservatoire on 8 October that same year. Despite the success of his musical debut, his career as a composer was short-lived. Boisselot had already assumed the management of his family business in Marseille and Barcelona, following the death of his brother Louis-Constantin (1809\u20131850), himself a successor to their father Jean-Louis (1782\u20131847), music publisher and musical-instrument manufacturer in Montpellier and Marseille. His achievements brought him many awards at exhibitions, such as one silver medal at the Paris Exposition of 1839, one gold medal at the French Industrial Exposition of 1844 and again at the London Great Exhibition of 1851. The quality of his grand pianos at home granted him a first class medal at the Exposition Universelle (1855), where his products were among the best of France and Spain. Poor financial operations and the Barcelona fire of 1855 put the company in difficulty. Boisselot retired that same year and passed the management of his factories over to his nephew, Franz Boisselot (1845\u20131902), whose godfather was Franz Liszt, and who completely restored his business to a prosperous situation, delivering 600 to 800 pianos per year, with a large number destined for export. In 1867, he was appointed inspector-general of music schools and music theatres in Marseille. Having not abandoned his compositions, he played in 1869 in Marseille, fragments of a lyrical epic entitled L'Ange d\u00e9chu. He died in Paris."

In 1780, he joined the crew of the Degranbourg, a merchantman chartered by the Crown in Suffren's fleet, on which he took part in the Battle of Porto Praya. At the arrival at the Cape of Good Hope, Lejoille took command of Degranbourg while his father returned to France. In 1783, Lejoille returned to the merchant navy. On 6 May 1793, he was appointed Lieutenant and given command of the 14-gun corvette C\u00e9leste, which he ferried to Toulon. On 14, an incident occurred between C\u00e9leste and the Danish brig Franc-Navire, under Captain Elepsem, that triggered an investigation by the National Convention. Hennequin states that while crossing, C\u00e9leste captured the British war-brig Shout, of 18 guns. Arrived in Toulon, Lejoille was appointed to the Tonnant as first officer. He distinguished himself during the action of 8 June 1794 where the frigate Alceste was captured, and transferred on Alceste as her new captain. In 1795, he took part in the squadron under Admiral Martin, and was the first ship to overhaul and engage the 74-gun HMS Berwick at the action of 8 March 1795 where she was captured. A shot from Alceste having decapitated Berwick 's captain Adam Littlejohn, Lejoille was credited with much of the merit of the capture, and granted command of the prize. However, severely wounded at the right arm and leg, he was transferred to the flagship and convalesced in Genoa for eight months. Promoted to Chef de Division during his convalescence, Lejoille was first sent to Venice to oversee commissionings of the ships captured in the harbour, and then transferred to Corfu to take command of the 74-gun G\u00e9n\u00e9reux, in Brueys' squadron. He took part in the Battle of the Nile at the rear of the French line, duelling with HMS Bellerophon. His men inflicted heavy damage on the Bellerophon, but were damaged themselves in turn and eventually fled from the battlefield. After the Battle of the Nile, G\u00e9n\u00e9reux sailed to Corfu with  and the frigate Diane and Justice, which he lost en route. Near Crete, G\u00e9n\u00e9reux met with HMS Leander, which she captured in the action of 18 August 1798. The British officers were released on parole. British sources later accused the French crew and Lejoille himself of plunder and various war crimes; the French captain who ferried the paroled officers of Leander to Trieste attacked the charges, and in his  Batailles navales de la France, Troude accuses William James of further \"augmenting\" the accusations originally published in the Gazette de Vienne. L\u00e9on Gu\u00e9rin claims that the accusations stem entirely from the Life of Nelson and that it furthermore fabricated a report by Lejoille. During the Siege of Corfu, Lejoille led G\u00e9n\u00e9reux to assist General Chabot and to harass the Russian blockade. As the situation of Corfu became more critical, Lejoille decided to organise a relief operation: he sailed to Ancona with G\u00e9n\u00e9reux and the brig Rivoli, where he loaded a 1000-man force, along with ammunition and food. One month later, he sailed back to Corfu. Awaiting a reconnaissance of Corfu, Lejoille decided to moor his ships in Brindisi harbour. In order to do so, he intended to sail past the fort defending the entrance channel without firing and attack it from behind. However, a navigation error grounded G\u00e9n\u00e9reux under the fort, forcing Lejoille to accept a gunnery duel. Lejoille was killed in the subsequent exchange of fire. Captain Touffet replaced Lejoille, and the fort and city of Brindisi surrendered after a two-hour battle. G\u00e9n\u00e9reux was refloated and awaited news from Corfu, which had in fact fallen on 3 March 1799; when informed, she put to sail and returned to Ancona. A xebec captured near Livorno was named Lejoille in his honour in March 1799."

However, the wounds he sustained in that campaign ended his military career. Gambier-Parry was also known for his work as an author, musician, and artist. He succeeded to the manor at Highnam Court following the death of his half-brother Sir Hubert Parry. In addition, he preserved and archived the art collection that had been amassed by his father Thomas Gambier Parry; the masterpieces were eventually bequeathed to the Courtauld Institute of Art."

        "content": "Gambier-Parry served in the Volunteers. By 1871, he had joined the Royal North Gloucestershire Regiment of Militia as a supernumerary lieutenant. He was promoted to lieutenant and, on 2 December 1874, he joined the Royal Welch Fusiliers (23rd Regiment of Foot) in that rank. Gambier-Parry became an instructor of musketry to the 2nd Battalion in 1880 and was at the Royal Citadel, Plymouth, in 1881. He resigned as instructor of musketry on 22 August 1881. On 14 February 1883, he left the Royal Welch Fusiliers as a lieutenant, and joined the Devon Yeomanry, the Royal 1st Devon. On 12 February 1885, he was given the rank of captain in the army. Gambier-Parry participated as a special service officer in the Suakin Expedition of March 1885 commanded by Major-General Sir Gerald Graham VC, following the Siege of Khartoum, to avenge the murder of General Charles George Gordon in January 1885. The moments before Gordon's death and beheading were portrayed in the painting General Gordon's Last Stand (pictured) by George William Joy. The Suakin Expedition was also an attempt to change the course of the Mahdist War. During the Eastern Sudan campaign of March 1885, Captain Gambier-Parry was seriously wounded. That military campaign in the Sudan was the subject of his published work Suakin, 1885, which he penned during his convalescence. In the preface to that book, he requested \"the indulgence of critics . . . on behalf of one who has carried a sword more often than a pen.\" He was appointed as a captain in the reserve of officers on 28 October 1885, and was subsequently promoted to the honorary rank of major on 7 May 1886 for his gallant conduct. He was invalided from the army and resigned his commission. During the First World War, he was commandant of No. 6 Red Cross Hospital in Oxfordshire, the Goring Auxiliary Hospital. Gambier-Parry was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1918. He was the president of the Gloucester Children's Hospital that had been established by his father. He was also a Gloucestershire magistrate. Gambier-Parry had a strong interest in the arts. Not only was he an author; he was also a musician and artist. In addition to Suakin, 1885, Gambier-Parry was the author of Annals of an Eton House with some Notes on the Evans Family, Sketches of a Yachting Cruise, Day-dreams, The Pageant of my Day, Murphy: A Message to Dog-lovers, Allegories of the Land, The Spirit of the Old Folk, Life of Reynell Taylor, and Ainslie Gore: A Sketch from Life. He was a member of the Gloucester Committee of the Three Choirs Festival. He often exhibited his paintings at the Royal Academy and other venues. Gambier-Parry assumed the role of family archivist. He was reluctant to sell the collection of paintings and other art objects that his father had collected over his lifetime. (His younger son Mark similarly attempted to avoid the attention of dealers and instead bequeathed the Gambier-Parry collection intact to the Courtauld Institute of Art.) The Gambier-Parry archive included an 1897 inventory of the estate that Ernest Gambier-Parry compiled and was used in the research of the collection for the Courtauld Institute. His inventory documented prominent members of the art world who were friends of his father and viewed the collection. They included two presidents of the Royal Academy: Sir Frederic Leighton and Sir Edward John Poynter. The former selected works from the collection in 1888 to show in the Royal Academy's Winter Exhibition. After his father's death, Gambier-Parry extended invitations to art experts to view the collection at Highnam. The visits occurred primarily in the 1910s and 1920s. Gambier-Parry documented the visits and the impressions or detailed appraisals offered by the experts. The visitors included Professor Charles John Holmes, director of the National Gallery; Sir Claude Phillips, curator of the Wallace Collection; Roger Eliot Fry; Bernard Berenson; Dr. Raymond van Marle, author of The Development of the Italian Schools of Painting, William George Constable of the National Gallery, and historian Welbore St. Clair Baddeley."

Following the death of his mother Ethelinda Lear in 1896, his half-brother Hubert Parry inherited the Highnam Court estate. The two brothers disagreed over the management of Highnam Court, which was in grave financial difficulty. Ernest Gambier-Parry moved out and his brother moved into Highnam Court. The two brothers remained estranged for the rest of their lives. Gambier-Parry lived in Goring prior to Hubert Parry's death in 1918, at which time he succeeded him to the estate at Highnam Court. Ernest Gambier-Parry and his wife had two children, although neither of their sons ever married. His elder son Thomas Robert Gambier-Parry was a botanist. He also became curator of the Department of Oriental Collections at the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford. His son Robert died in February 1935; his wife Evelyn died that same year.

He is now a council member of the Orang Asli Development Advisory Council, a think-tank set up by the Rural and Regional Development Ministry, and also sits on the Orang Asli Rights Committee in the Malaysian Bar Council. Amani Williams and his colleague Augustine Anthony, had actively helped to acquit four Orang Asli men charged with killing a tiger on 27 October 2012. Yok Rayau Yok Senian (50), Yok Kalong Bah Rapee (51), Yok Mat Bah Chong (48) and Hassan Bah Ong (33), all from the Semai tribe of an Orang Asli settlement near Sungkai were jointly charged under the 1972 Wild Life (Protection) Act for killing with a shotgun a tiger, which is a protected and listed species under the act. It was reported in the media that the four and another friend, Yok Meneh Yok Din, 47, had gone to the Bukit Tapah forest reserve to collect jungle produce when a tiger attacked Yok Meneh. One of the four then shot the tiger dead to save their friend from being attacked. Eight prosecution witnesses testified in the trial. The four orang asli men, were acquitted and discharged by the magistrate's court in Tapah. Magistrate Fairuz Adiba Ismail made the decision after the prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case against the four accused. There were shouts of joy outside the courtroom when news filtered in about the acquittal. Some 30 orang asli people, dressed in their traditional attire, had gathered at the court building to provide moral support. In celebratory mood, the Orang Asli held a thanksgiving to celebrate the acquittal at Kampong Chang Sungai Gepai, Bidor. The two lawyers who fought their case pro bono, Augustine Anthony and Amani Williams were guests of honour."

He left the party, dealing a serious blow and raising a question mark over its multi-racial stance and commitment to help the indigenous people.

The two contributed tens of millions of dollars, much of it anonymously, toward various educational entities, both public and private. The O'Donnell Foundation is the fifth largest independent foundation in Dallas. In 1983, the UT regents established the Peter O'Donnell, Jr., Centennial Chair in Computing Systems.\"No one in history has had a greater impact on science and engineering in Texas than Peter O'Donnell,\" said J. Tinsley Oden, the mathematician and engineering professor and director of the UT Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences. O'Donnell also worked to seek the expansion of the University of Texas at Dallas into a four-year institution and in obtaining the since defunct Superconducting Super Collider near Waxahachie in Ellis County south of Dallas. The trust is rooted in Mrs. O'Donnell's inheritance. In 2016, the couple resigned from leading the O'Donnell Foundation, according to their profile at the Texas State History Museum Foundation. In 2008, O'Donnell was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and received a doctor of humane letters from Southern Methodist University in University Park, Texas. He served on the National Academy of Sciences and was a founding member, along with former U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, of the Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas, which distributes annual awards to outstanding scholars in those fields. In 2013, O'Donnell received the Distinguished Service Award from Texas Exes, the alumni association of the University of Texas. He was the director and member of the executive committee of University Medical Center, Inc. He was the former director of Dallas Biomedical Corporation, InterFirst Bank, and Stadium Associates. In 2013, UT announced the naming of the O'Donnell Building for Applied Computational Engineering and Sciences. The O'Donnell Foundation has given more than $135\u00a0million to UT alone between 1983 and 2013. UT President William C. Powers declared the O'Donnells \"among the greatest supporters of the University of Texas in its 130-year history. Their transformative generosity is based on the belief in our power to change society for the better.\" In 2008, O'Donnell pledged $18\u00a0million to finance the hiring of UT faculty members undertaking research in the use of mathematics, computers, and multiple scientific disciplines; his pledge was matched by W. A. \"Tex\" Moncrief, Jr., an oilman and philanthropist from Fort Worth. The Arts and Technology Building at UT-Dallas was named in 2013 in Edith O'Donnell's honor."

        "title": "Peter O'Donnell (businessman)_Political life",
        "content": "O'Donnell was a Texas delegate to the 1960 Republican National Convention in Chicago, which nominated the Nixon-Lodge ticket. He was an alternate delegate to the New Orleans convention in 1988, which nominated George Herbert Walker Bush and Dan Quayle. In the fall of 1960, O'Donnell was the Dallas County Republican chairman and compiled a record of considerable success. His responsibility was to recruit party workers to get out the vote for Nixon-Lodge and John Tower for the U.S. Senate, with whom O'Donnell was politically close. In 1963, prior to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, as the state party chairman O'Donnell tried to convince the Republican National Committee to host the 1964 convention in Dallas, but received little support in his endeavor. The Dallas Chamber of Commerce doubted that the $500,000 needed to make a serious bid for the convention would be cost-effective. O'Donnell said he would try again in 1968 if his 1964 bid failed. It was not until 1984 that the GOP held its convention in Dallas, when delegates renominated the Reagan-Bush ticket. O'Donnell's friend and political ally, Jack Crichton, the 1964 Texas Republican gubernatorial nominee against the later Republican convert John B. Connally, Jr., describes O'Donnell as a \"skilled organizer who located people around the nation who were in a position to promote the Goldwater cause.\" The director of the committee was New York City attorney F. Clifton White. After his nomination on July 15, 1964, at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, California, Goldwater, in Crichton's words, \"with boundless energy campaigned vigorously selling his belief in less government control, supported private enterprise, and increasing capital investment, [and] halting the drift toward socialism and increasing our national debt.\" O'Donnell served on the 1964 Republican national platform committee. Another Texan, Albert Bel Fay of Houston, was a member of the credentials committee in 1964 and was thereafter the Texas Republican national committeeman. In 1964, O'Donnell supported George H. W. Bush of Houston in his losing race for the U. S. Senate, first in the primary against Jack Cox, the 1962 Republican gubernatorial nominee, and then in the general election against the Democratic incumbent, Ralph Yarborough. The 1964 general election was a Republican disaster in Texas; with the defeats of U.S. Representatives Bruce Alger and Ed Foreman, the party was reduced to a single seat held by Frank Kell Cahoon of Midland in the 150-member Texas House of Representatives. Republican John Tower continued to hold the other Senate seat once filled by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1968, Chairman O'Donnell led the Nixon supporters in his state at the national convention in Miami Beach, Florida. This placed him in conflict once again with Jack Cox, the leader of the burgeoning forces backing Ronald Reagan in his first brief bid for the nomination. The 1968 Republican defeats in Texas, Hubert Humphrey won the state's electoral votes, and Conservative Democrat Preston Smith was elected governor over Republican Paul Eggers, led to calls to replace O'Donnell as chairman in 1969. By 1972, the Republicans hoped once more to rebound in Texas. Albert Fay lost the Republican primary for governor to former Democrat State Senator Henry Grover, also of Houston. In turn, Grover was defeated in a fairly close vote by the Democrat Dolph Briscoe, but John Tower won a third term in the Senate. In 1978, he was a key advisor to the narrow election of Bill Clements, the Dallas industrialist who became the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction. In 1987, still an advisor to Clements in the first year of Clements' second nonconsecutive term, O'Donnell convinced the governor to abandon an unpopular proposal for higher taxes. Over the years, O'Donnell has donated to various Republican candidates for office throughout the nation, including $245,000 between 2001 and 2010 to retiring Texas Governor Rick Perry. In 2011, O'Donnell, who usually kept a low public profile, criticized some of Perry's education proposals as \"absurd\", including replacing tenured faculty with lower-paid instructors, tying faculty bonuses to student evaluation of instruction, establishing a new accreditation of universities by an agency yet to be created, and the offering of an undergraduate degree that costs no more than $10,000. In 2013, the O'Donnell Foundation named Dallas attorney Tom Luce as its chief executive officer. Formerly the chief of staff to the Texas Select Committee on Public Education, Luce was named in 2005 as the assistant United States Secretary of Education under Margaret Spellings by U.S. President George W. Bush. He remains chairman of the National Math and Science Initiative. In the spring of 1990, Luce was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, won by Clayton W. Williams, Jr., of Midland, who then lost the general election to the Democrat Ann W. Richards."

Stringer was one of the few North Sydney players who elected to play on with the merged team. Stringer played with the Northern Eagles until the end of 2001.  He then signed for South Sydney who had just been re-admitted into the competition after they were controversially excluded from the league at the end of 1999.  Stringer played in the club's first game after readmission which was a 40-6 loss against rivals the Sydney Roosters.  Stringer played with South Sydney until the end of the 2004 NRL season although his time there wasn't successful with the club finishing last in 2003 and 2004.

Stringer was a key player in Parramatta's Minor Premiership in 2005 and again earned representative honours as a starting prop for the Country Origin side.

Having withdrawn from the Central Coast competition and joined the much stronger Newcastle Rugby League, Stringer led the club to a grand final appearance in his first year in charge, losing to Lakes United. In 2009, Stringer led the club to their first premiership in the Newcastle Premiership when he coached the side to a comprehensive victory over the heavily fancied Cessnock, 36\u20134. After leaving Wyong, Stringer returned to play with his junior club, the Berkeley Vale Panthers, the club in which he led to their very first junior premiership when he captained the under 15s when he was a goal kicking hooker. Stringer then joined the coaching ranks at Wests Tigers in 2015, taking charge of the forwards in the Under 20s competition. Head coach Jason Taylor then promoted Stringer to take charge as coach of the Wests Tigers NSW Cup side in 2016. This saw a marked improvement for the club at this level as Stringer galvanised the playing group and led them to the brink of an unlikely grand final berth, falling short with a 24-18 loss to the highly fancied Mounties with less than 3 minutes to play. Wests Tigers management again moved to promote Stringer in their coaching hierarchy for the 2017 NRL season where he took up duties alongside Jason Taylor as the assistant coach of the NRL First Grade side. Stringer left the club soon after Taylor was dismissed in 2017."

Critic Anthony Domestico lists the novel among Commonweal Magazine'''s Top Books of 2017, saying \"Antic, absurdist, comic, and Catholic, this ribald novel grows out of the Evelyn Waugh and John Kennedy Toole tradition. But I also heard echoes of W. H. Auden. Like him, Oser finds theology in two unlikely genres: the picaresque and the detective novel.\" According to Trevor C. Merrill at The University Bookman, Oregon Confetti \"represents an edgier, rowdier brand of religious literature. It takes on today\u2019s shoddiest secular ideologies and shows the dreariness of succumbing to them, but also the appeal of making the sacrifices necessary to leave them behind. Instead of addressing a nonbelieving audience 'which puts little stock in either grace or the devil,' as Flannery O\u2019Connor put it, Oser aims at a faithful subculture likely to share, or at the very least to sympathize with, his basic views on art, sex, and religion....In short: Oregon Confetti makes it possible once more to ask not where the American Catholic novel has gone, but where it is headed next.\" Martin Lockerd at Literary Matters comments on the novel's satire, saying \"At times, [Oser's] relentless satire recalls Walker Percy and Evelyn Waugh at their best...Other assaults on modern liberalism are harder to follow....It is a Catholic novel with a capital C. In a contemporary literary scene where such books almost never find a publisher, Oregon Confetti provides a welcome religious counter to the deluge of post-secular malaise found in most novels. Nevertheless,\" Lockerd comments, \"I couldn\u2019t help wanting something a bit subtler.\" Anne-Sophie Olsen at The Cornell Book Review portrays Oregon Confetti as such: \"In this sharp and fast-paced novel, author Lee Oser pits love against lust, beauty against aesthetics, and truth against falsehood in the politically charged art scene of Portland, Oregon. With writing that is self-aware and guided by a trust in the mysterious, Oser follows art dealer Devin Adams through tangled webs that intersect the past with the present and the cynical with the transcendent...Though Oser occasionally indulges in more teaching than storytelling, he has succeeded in holding honest, rough-edged characters up to the light of mystery and letting moments of grace change them for the better.\" Finally, In October 2018, critic Joseph Pearce listed Oregon Confetti in his list of \"The Best of Contemporary Christian Fiction.\""

P\u00e4tz also won a silver medal at the 2010 European Mixed Curling Championship (playing lead for Claudio P\u00e4tz) and a gold medal at the 2011 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship (with Sven Michel). P\u00e4tz started skipping her own rink in 2013. The 2014\u201315 season was a breakthrough year for P\u00e4tz and teammates Nadine Lehmann, Marisa Winkelhausen and Nicole Schw\u00e4gli. They won the 2014 Red Deer Curling Classic on the World Curling Tour, which was P\u00e4tz first tour win. P\u00e4tz also qualified for the playoffs at the 2014 Masters Grand Slam of Curling event. In the second half of the season, they won the International Bernese Ladies Cup and the Swiss Women's Curling Championship, qualifying them for the 2015 World Women's Curling Championship. Switzerland finished the round robin in first place with a 10\u20131 record. A victory over Canada's Jennifer Jones sent them to the final, where they once again faced Jones. Up 4\u20133 in the tenth end, P\u00e4tz drew to the button for the win, winning the World Championship gold medal and title. The following season, Team P\u00e4tz won the right to represent Switzerland at the 2015 European Curling Championships, but they did not qualify for the playoffs, finishing 4\u20135. They also did not win any tour events during the season. They could not defend their title as world champions, as they lost in the Swiss championship to 2014 world champions Binia Feltscher. The 2016\u201317 season was more successful for the Swiss rink. They won the 2017 International Bernese Ladies Cup and made the final of the Glynhill Ladies International. They also won the Swiss championship and represented Switzerland at the 2017 World Women's Curling Championship. Despite starting 4\u20130, the team lost six of their last seven games, ultimately not qualifying for the playoffs. They ended their season by finishing second at the 2017 Euronics European Masters and making the semifinals of the 2017 Humpty's Champions Cup. Team P\u00e4tz had several quarterfinal finishes during the 2017\u201318 curling season. They won the 2017 Stockholm Ladies Cup in October, defeating Kim Eun-jung in the final. The team competed against the other top Swiss teams, Silvana Tirinzoni and Binia Feltscher, at the 2017 Swiss Olympic Curling Trials to choose the Swiss representative at the 2018 Winter Olympics. The event was ultimately won by the Tirinzoni rink, who finished 6\u20130. After failing to win the Swiss championship in February, the P\u00e4tz team disbanded. Heading into the 2018\u201319 curling season, P\u00e4tz joined forces with Silvana Tirinzoni, who would skip the team, but P\u00e4tz would throw fourth rocks, with Esther Neuenschwander at second and Melanie Barbezat throwing lead rocks. The team reached the final in the first Grand Slam of the season, the Elite 10. They represented Switzerland at the 2018 European Curling Championships, claiming the silver medal. They were unbeaten in the round robin, winning nine games, defeated Germany 6\u20134 in the semi-final, and lost 5\u20134 to Sweden's Anna Hasselborg in the final. Having won the 2019 Swiss National Championships, the team represented Switzerland at the 2019 World Women's Curling Championship in Silkeborg, Denmark. The team went 2\u20133 in their first five games, then won six games in a row to secure their playoff spot. They went on to finish the round robin with a 8\u20134 record and in fourth place in the standings. They defeated China in the qualification game and South Korea in the semi-final to set up a repeat of the European Championship final against Hasselborg and Sweden. The result was reversed, with P\u00e4tz making a draw to the four-foot in the extra end for an 8\u20137 win to become the 2019 world champions. The team capped off their year by winning their first Grand Slam title together at the Champions Cup and reaching the final of the inaugural Curling World Cup. At the start of the 2019\u201320 season, Team Tirinzoni were runners-up at the 2019 Cameron's Brewing Oakville Fall Classic. They also qualified for the playoffs at their next three events, the 2019 Stu Sells Oakville Tankard, the 2019 AMJ Campbell Shorty Jenkins Classic and the 2019 WCT Uiseong International Curling Cup. The next week, they won the Women's Masters Basel. They represented Switzerland at the 2019 European Curling Championships, where they finished the round robin in first place with an 8\u20131 record. However, they would not make the final, as they lost to Scotland's Eve Muirhead in the semifinal. They rebounded in the bronze medal game, defeating Alina Kovaleva of Russia. The team would not get to defend their title as world champions, losing the final of the 2020 Swiss Women's Curling Championship to the young Elena Stern rink. The Swiss championship would be the team's last event of the season, as both the Players' Championship and the Champions Cup Grand Slam events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Team Tirinzoni began the 2020\u201321 season by making the final of the 2020 Schweizer Cup where they once again lost to the Stern rink. Three weeks later, the team was invited to play in the Adelboden International men's World Curling Tour event, as a last minute addition. After dropping their first game to Yannick Schwaller, they went on a four-game winning streak against the men's field before losing to Olympic bronze medallist Peter de Cruz in the semifinal. In January 2021, P\u00e4tz compted at the 2021 Swiss Mixed Doubles Curling Championship with her boyfriend Sven Michel. The pair finished the round robin with a 5\u20132 record, in second place. They then defeated teammate Silvana Tirinzoni and Beno\u00eet Schwarz in the semifinal before losing the best-of-three final to Briar H\u00fcrlimann and Yannick Schwaller. Two weeks later, P\u00e4tz won her fourth national championship at the 2021 Swiss Women's Curling Championship. This put her team in a playoff against 2020 Champions Team Stern for the right to represent Switzerland at the 2021 World Women's Curling Championship, as the 2020 Worlds were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Team Tirinzoni beat Stern in the playoff, and represented Switzerland at the World Championship, which was played in a bio-secure bubble in Calgary, Canada due to the pandemic. There, they finished with a 12\u20131 round robin record, including scoring a rare eight-ender against Denmark, the first time an eight-ender has ever been scored at a World Championship. In the playoffs, the team defeated the United States in the semifinal, and then Alina Kovaleva representing RCF (Russia) in the final to win the gold medal, successfully defending their 2019 championship. While also in the Calgary bubble, Team Tirinzoni played in two Grand Slam events, making the final at the 2021 Champions Cup and the semifinals at the 2021 Players' Championship."

Talbot was educated at Christ's College, Christchurch, where he captained the First XI cricket team and the First XV Rugby team. A middle-order batsman and medium-pace bowler, he made his first-class debut for Canterbury in a Plunket Shield match against Otago in January 1923, aged 19. He scored 105 in the first innings, the highest score in the match, and after not bowling in Otago's first innings, took 3 for 38 in the second. Canterbury won by 10 wickets, won Talbot's next match as well, and finished the season champions. In 1925-26 he took 5 for 106 in 18 overs as Wellington made 494 for 9 on the first day, then made a pair when Wellington dismissed Canterbury cheaply twice on the second day. He did not make a fifty between his debut match and 1929\u201330, when he scored 50 and 113 in a narrow loss to Wellington. In 1930-31 he scored 182 runs at 30.33 and took six wickets at 32.33 to contribute to Canterbury's victory in the Plunket Shield and earn himself selection in the 14-man team to tour England in 1931. In 24 first-class matches on the tour Talbot made 759 runs at 23.71 with four fifties and a highest score of 66, and took 17 wickets at 50.70. He was the only player not to appear in the Tests. Early in the tour he played a part in the victory over MCC at Lord's, when he made 66 in 50 minutes, \"hitting half-volleys as if he hated them\", and hitting one ball onto the top of the pavilion roof. Opening the batting for Canterbury against Auckland in the first match of the 1932-33 season he made 55 and 117, his highest score. He moved to Otago in 1933, playing four matches in the next three seasons with moderate success. He also played squash, golf, bowls and athletics, and he played rugby for Canterbury."

He first played for Kent's Second XI in 1901 and made his first-class cricket debut for the county in May 1902 against MCC at Lord's. He played in two matches in 1902, taking five wickets. Fairservice is often credited with taking the wicket of W.G. Grace as his first wicket in first-class cricket. Fairservice did bowl Grace twice in the same match in May 1903, again against MCC at Lord's, but his first wickets were taken in the same fixture the previous year in which Grace did not play. Fairservice played fairly regularly from 1903 until the start of World War I during a period in which Kent won four County Championship titles. He took at least 35 wickets in every season other than 1912, although his opportunities were limited as Kent had spin bowlers Colin Blythe and Frank Woolley as regulars in the team at this time. He was awarded his county cap in 1903. With Blythe killed in the war, Fairservice had increased opportunities in 1919 and 1920. In the latter, a cool summer with many wet pitches, Fairservice had his most productive season, taking 113 wickets at an average of 17.46, although Wisden admitted that batsmen still did not find him difficult when pitches were firm. A highlight of that season was when he and Woolley bowled out Surrey for 61 and 73 on a slow, sticky wicket at Blackheath. In the exceptionally hot and dry summer of 1921, however, Fairservice was less effective, taking only 50 wickets at an average of 32.50, and announced his retirement at the close of 1921 after being awarded a benefit match against Surrey, although he played for Northumberland between 1924 and 1926."

After showcasing her boxing skills during her audition, Lee asked her to go home and come back wearing a more feminine outfit and make-up, like her character in the film.

Klementieff moved to Los Angeles after Oldboy was filmed and began pursuing more Hollywood auditions. She continued taekwondo after the film, and has a purple belt as of the summer of 2014.

Jones continued to study in France until 1881 apart from a trip to Baltimore in the summer of 1879 and a period in the winter of 1879\u201380 when he painted a military panorama in London. He returned to New York in 1881 and shared a studio in the Sherwood Studio Building with his brother. In 1882 he was elected to the Society of American Artists. He then returned to Paris."

        "content": "Jones finally moved back to the United States and settled in New York City in 1884, where his work as a figure painter was quickly recognized. Although he did not have to work for a living, he taught portraiture at the Art Students League of New York. He also obtained commissions for illustrations from Scribner's Monthly and The Century Magazine. In October 1893 Scribner's published a set of his views of historic houses in Washington. From 1895 Jones painted murals. In the summers he would make painting expeditions to the Berkshires at South Egremont, Massachusetts. By the 1890s Jones had a solid reputation and began to take a leading role in the art world of New York. Jones taught at the National Academy of Design for over thirty years. For twenty two years he was treasurer of the National Academy of Design. From 1917 to 1930 Jones was a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Around 1907 Jones, his brother and their invalid sister Louise moved into an expensively furnished studio and home at 33 West Sixty-seventh Street in Manhattan. In 1929 Jones experienced a stroke that left him acutely paralyzed. He died in 1932."

        "content": "In his early work Jones depicted genre scenes in richly decorated interiors. His technique was precise, academic and detailed. He was always interested in costumes and decorations. He became attracted to themes of classical antiquity, and started to paint subjects in classical costumes surrounded by decorative objects from that era. His later work showed the influence of impressionism. These more loosely executed works after 1910 often showed women at ease in outdoor as well as indoor settings. At the 1885 annual show of the National Academy of Design Jones's picture Exchanging Confidences won the Thomas B. Clarke Prize for best figure composition. Jones also won prizes from the Saint Louis Exposition and the Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition of 1915. His works is exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Wichita Art Museum. The Art Institute of Chicago also holds his work."

        "content": "Pinkwart's political career is closely knit to the FDP (Free Democratic Party). He joined the party in 1980, at the age of 19. From 1988 to 1990 he was part of the FDP's scientific staff and from 1991 onwards he was first secretary to the chairman of the FDP's parliamentary group in the Bundestag, Hermann Otto Solms. Pinkwart's career in Higher Education began 1994 at the College of Higher Education in D\u00fcsseldorf, where he was professor of Economics and Management Science. From 1998 onwards a professorship at the University of Siegen followed, where Pinkwart taught Business Administration with focus on SMEs. In 2002, Pinkwart succeeded J\u00fcrgen M\u00f6llemann as chairman of the FDP in North Rhine-Westphalia, an office he held until 2010. From 2003, he also served as one of the national party's deputy chairmen under the leadership of Guido Westerwelle. From 2002 to 2005 Pinkwart was a Member of Parliament (German Bundestag), where he was part of the FDP parliamentary group led by Wolfgang Gerhardt. He served as his parliamentary group\u2019s spokesperson on the Finance Committee between 2002 and 2004 and later as the group\u2019s spokesperson on the national budget. From 2004, he also led the Bundestag group of FDP parliamentarians from North Rhine-Westphalia, one of the largest delegations within the FDP parliamentary group. From 2005 until 2010, Pinkwart served as State Minister for Innovation, Technology and Research and Deputy Minister-President of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, under the leadership of Minister-President J\u00fcrgen R\u00fcttgers. In this capacity, he was also a Member of the Federal Council (Bundesrat of Germany). During his time in office, the state government tried hard to win new research institutions to be set up in North Rhine-Westphalia; eventually, the Max Planck Society set up its Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing in Cologne, and the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres based a new German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Bonn. Following the 2009 federal elections, Pinkwart was part of the FDP team in the negotiations with Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU on a coalition agreement. He led his party's delegation in the working group on education and research policy; his co-chair of the CDU/CSU was Annette Schavan. At the beginning of 2011 Pinkwart became a senior research fellow at the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies (AICGS) at the Johns Hopkins University, Washington D.C. His research project as fellow focused on the roles of universities as entrepreneurial hubs and engines of innovation in the U.S. and Germany. From 2011 he served as Dean of HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management and the first holder of the Stiftungsfonds Deutsche Bank Chair of Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship. Following the 2017 state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Pinkwart was part of the FDP team in the negotiations with Armin Laschet\u2019s CDU on a coalition agreement. He led his party's delegation in the working group on economic affairs and energy policy; his co-chair of the CDU was Hendrik W\u00fcst. Since July 2017, Pinkwart has been serving as State Minister for Economic Affairs, Digitization, Innovation and Energy in the government of Minister-President Armin Laschet. In this capacity, he is also one of the state's representatives on the Bundesrat, where he serves on the Committee on Foreign Affairs; the Committee on Economic Affairs; and the Committee on Urban Development, Housing and Regional Planning. In the negotiations to form a so-called traffic light coalition of the Social Democrats (SPD), the Green Party and the FDP following the 2021 federal elections, Pinkwart led his party's delegation in the working group on digital policy; his co-chairs from the other parties were Jens Zimmermann and Malte Spitz. Pinkwart was nominated by his party as delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2022."

On energy policy, Pinkwart is widely regarded to be a critic of the country\u2019s energy transition as envisioned by former chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and current leader Angela Merkel. In 2017, he held that he wanted to preserve the use of fossil fuels and place greater restrictions on where wind turbines can be built. In 2018, he demanded at least 10 billion euros ($11.5 billion) in structural support if coal-fired power stations are phased out."

Goldie was born in Paris, France and baptised on 25 April 1825 in St Marylebone Parish Church, London. He was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge in 1843. Goldie graduated from Cambridge University in 1847 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and was ordained as a priest in the Church of England. He was priest in charge at High Toynton, Lincolnshire in 1851 and then from 1852 to 1866 he had the same position at St Thomas's Church, Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire. He was vicar of St Ives (then in Huntingdonshire) from 1866 until his death there in 1886. Goldie's tenure at St Ives was controversial and his \"ritualistic proceedings\" alienated many of the congregation; he also attempted to impose church rates and was consistently and successfully opposed on that and on his candidates for the post of churchwarden in \"stormy\" parish meetings that attracted hundreds of people. Goldie's first-class cricket career was accidental. In the 1846 University Match between Cambridge University and Oxford University, held at Oxford, the Cambridge batsman John Walker did not appear for the match; the Cambridge team batted one man short in the first innings, but Goldie was co-opted to bat at No 11 in the second innings, and scored one run. Goldie married Harriet Nicol, the daughter of a Bengal Army colonel, in 1848; among their children was John Goldie, who won fame in rowing at Cambridge and at Henley and after whom the Goldie second string Cambridge University rowing team is named."

At fourteen, she entered the theater world in a stock company, before moving on to vaudeville. In vaudeville, she met her husband, Lee Gresham, and the two formed an act together. While performing in Los Angeles, they were noticed by producer Edward Small, which led to her beginning in the film industry. Blake made her film debut in a small role in I Have Lived (1933), directed by Richard Thorpe. She had her first featured role later that same year in Rainbow over Broadway, which Thorpe also directed. Over her 20-year career, she appeared in over 100 films. She was noted for playing very talkative supporting roles. Appearing mostly in supporting or bit parts, she was occasionally given a featured role, as in Lucky Night (1939), which starred Myrna Loy and Robert Taylor; or Woman of the Year (1942), which starred Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, in which she played Flo Peters, the wife of a friend of Tracy's character. Even more rarely she would be given the lead in a film, such as in Racing Blood (1936). In the early 1940s, she played the recurring role of \"Maisie\" in several of the Dr. Kildare films starring Lew Ayres, Lionel Barrymore, and Laraine Day. Other notable films in which she appeared include: Ship Ahoy (1942), starring Eleanor Powell and Red Skelton; the Abbott and Costello film, Who Done It?; the 1943 version of Phantom of the Opera, starring Claude Raines; The Naughty Nineties, again with Abbott and Costello; On the Town; The Yellow Cab Man, starring Red Skelton; and the 1952 epic, The Greatest Show on Earth. Blake's final role was in 1952's This Woman is Dangerous, starring Joan Crawford and Dennis Morgan, in which she plays a garrulous hairdresser. Blake died on May 21, 1983, in Sacramento, California."

Sukkhongdumnoen qualified for the Thai squad in the women's featherweight class (57\u00a0kg) at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by defeating Uzbekistan's Irina Kaydashova for the top spot and securing a berth from the Asian Olympic Qualifying Tournament in her native Bangkok.

        "content": "McCallum earned his BS with a double major in agriculture and biology from Illinois State University,.  He earned a MS in Environmental Biology from Eastern Illinois University and the PhD degree in Environmental Science from Arkansas State University, specializing in ecotoxicology and conservation ecology.  He is notable alumni from all three universities. He has been ranked among the 150 most influential environmental scientists. In 1997 his discovery of deformed frogs in Madison County, Illinois received media coverage in St. Louis news outlets. He then worked at the St. Louis Children's Aquarium as the institution's grant writer, and designed educational programs, conducted research on the use of bovine somatotropin (bST) applications in aquaculture, and delivered tours and extension programming until he left to pursue his PhD in 1999. He also organized and edited the First International Symposium on the conservation and sustainability of the ornamental fish industry on Rio Negro River, Manaus.  He participated in several areas of research that later were published by the aquarium from 1999-2001. Stanley E. Trauth was his doctoral mentor. Many of his early papers were focused on natural history, but they also cover amphibian conservation, ecological immunology, and general biology.  He is widely published on the life history and conservation of Blanchard's cricket frog (Acris blanchardi ) with papers on its systematics, immunology, behavior, life history, and conservation needs.  He continued this research as an Assistant Professor at Louisiana State University at Shreveport from 2003\u20132005. In 2006 McCallum and several other scientists established the journal Herpetological Conservation and Biology. He moved to Texas A&M University Texarkana in 2005. Here, he developed a novel teaching method for classroom discussions. \"The result of this model was not only to circumvent many lazy student behaviors, but also to improve reading comprehension by familiarizing students with how to read, process, and evaluate complex scientific manuscripts in a short period of time.\" Hedwig P\u00f6ll\u00f6l\u00e4inen. McCallum used fuzzy logic in his paper, Amphibian decline or extinction? Current losses dwarf background extinction rates, to compare recent extinction rates of amphibians to their rates at the k-Pg boundary. His calculations demonstrated that the losses in amphibian biodiversity in recent times represented one of the most rapid losses in biodiversity ever observed. In 2008 the study was listed by Discover Magazine as #4 among ten \"landmark papers\" on the topic of amphibian extinctions and declines. His use of fuzzy approaches was extended to two studies addressing climate change impacts on herpetofauna.McCallum, M.L. 2010. Future Climate Change Spells Catastrophe for Blanchard\u2019s Cricket Frog, Acris blanchardi (Amphibia, Anura, Hylidae). Acta Herpetologica 5(1):119-130. His 2015 paper argued that species losses of vertebrate animals since 1980 have been faster that the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event that wiped out dinosaurs 65 million years ago, suggesting we are in a 6th mass extinction.Anonymous. (June 16, 2015). Today's biodiversity losses comprise a sixth mass extinction. BirdWatch Magazine (UK) http://www.birdwatch.co.uk/channel/newsitem.asp?c=11&cate=__15971 In 2014 he conducted a study using Google Trends to data mine Google search data to infer public interest on the environment, and concluded that interest in the environment had fallen since 2004. In 2019, he compared Google searches before and after release of the landmark encyclical, [[Laudato si'|Laudato Si']], revealing that interest in the environment rose markedly in most countries around the world."
