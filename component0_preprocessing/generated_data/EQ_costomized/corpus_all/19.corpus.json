However, the attention was short lived, as both moved on to other franchises.  Prokopec was traded to Toronto on 13 December 2001 with Chad Ricketts in exchange for C\u00e9sar Izturis and Paul Quantrill.\nProkopec's 2002 tenure with the Toronto Blue Jays was unsuccessful, as he went 2-9 and sustained a labral tear injury late in the season. In short order, the Blue Jays granted Prokopec free agency in October 2002.  The Los Angeles Dodgers then signed him that November, but kept him off their 40-man roster, and the Cincinnati Reds subsequently claimed Prokopec from Los Angeles in the Rule 5 Draft in December. However, Prokopec would never throw another pitch (in either the majors or the minors) for any organization\u2014further labral problems occurred, forcing Prokopec's early retirement from professional baseball at the age of 24.\nProkopec returned to Australia, and in 2013 was a baseball instructor for the Queensland Academy of Sport in Brisbane."

Pope Francis praised him as \"a zealous man of culture and faith\" who embodied \"a spirit of service for the good of the Church [and] dedication to the most suffering\". The Minister for European and Foreign Affairs of Malta, Evarist Bartolo, also expressed his condolences on behalf of the government of Malta. His funeral Mass took place on 5 May at Santa Maria del Priorato Church, presided over by Giovanni Angelo Becciu. He was buried in the crypt of that church next to two of his predecessors, Angelo de Mojana di Cologna and Andrew Bertie. Although the election of a new leader usually takes place within three months after the death or resignation of a Grand Master, the Order confirmed that the election would probably be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

He taught elementary and middle school at Palm Crest Elementary School and Foothill Intermediate School in La Canada, California from 1961\u20131964.  His leadership in the classroom was respected and this led to his promotion to Assistant Middle School Principal at that same Foothill Intermediate School from 1964\u20131965.  In 1965, he moved up to Middle School Principal and Central Project Director, Temple City USD, Temple City, California.\nIt was during his five years at Temple City that he started to formulate his ideas into writing.  His observations in the classroom and school became the groundwork for his first book Differentiated staffing: Giving teaching a chance to improve learning published in 1969.\nThe book was well received, and it was not long before he was putting his theories into practice.  In 1970 he was asked to direct a project in staff differentiation with three pilot schools in the Mesa Public Schools District in Mesa, Arizona.  The project was funded by Arizona State University where English was employed with the title of Project Director/Visiting Lecturer. In essence he was conducting practical research by being allowed to reorganize each pilot school along slightly different models and then measure performance differences.  This work was the topic of his Doctoral Dissertation, and he received his Ph.D. in 1972.\nThere was a clear improvement of student performance due to organization and differentiation of staff.  The positive results were published in two books  Strategies for Differentiated Staffing (1972) and School Organization and Management (1975).\nWhat worked in Arizona on the small scale would get its true test in the Sarasota County, Florida district schools.  English was hired as the Assistant Superintendent for Personnel and Program Development by that district.  At 25,000 students, the implementation was more difficult but just as effective as in Arizona.\nIn 2013, English would be one of the first professors of the Master of Arts in Educational Leadership at Soka University of America, Orange County, California. Being one of the pioneers of this MA Program, English described it as unique and said: \"For a potential educational leader who wants to make a difference in the world Soka is the place where it happens.\""

Arlington, Virginia.  Although this position was honorary, it gave him exposure to people and movements within education at the national level.  It also gave him the opportunity to plan and direct two national summer conferences in Minneapolis and Denver.\nHe documented his ideas and work in his books School Organization and Management, Needs Assessment: A focus for Curriculum Development and Quality Control in Curriculum Development.\nIn Washington, D.C. in the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter's administration was moving for the creation of a cabinet-level Department of Education.  Consultants were needed who knew education at the practical level.  In 1979 English was hired by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. (KPMG Peat Marwick) as their National Practice Director, North American Continent, for Elementary and Secondary Education, in the firm's Washington, D.C. Office. The consulting business opened English's eyes to a whole new set of tools.  Business auditing and accounting practices were well-refined and formed the core of KPMG's business.  English grasped these tools quickly and was successful in being elected as a partner in the firm in 1980.  \t\nCould business auditing practices be used to further refine Educational Administration to create a better education system?  English discussed the concept and the potential benefits in Improving Curriculum Management in the Schools (1980), and Fundamental Curriculum Decisions (1983).\nThis theory became practice when in 1979 English was asked to conduct a \"Curriculum Audit\" of the Columbus, Ohio Public School District.  This was the first of many formal curriculum audits conducted by English or under his guidelines. The name, \"Curriculum Audit\" was subsequently changed to \"Curriculum Management Audit\" when Virginia Vertiz, Director of the National Curriculum Audit Center from 1990 to 1996, became involved in the improvement of the process.\nIn 1982 English was asked to become Superintendent of Schools for the prestigious Northport-East Northport Union Free School District in Northport, New York on Long Island, New York."

He became Professor extraordinarius of botany at the University of Li\u00e8ge from 1835 to 1837, and full professor from 1837 to 1854.\nPollination of Vanilla orchids is required to make the plants produce the pods from which vanilla extract is obtained. In 1837, Morren was among the first to publish a method for artificial pollination of Vanilla, but his method proved financially unworkable and was not deployed commercially. In 1841, Edmond Albius, a 12-year-old slave who lived on the French island of R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean, discovered that the plant could be hand-pollinated. Hand-pollination allowed global cultivation of the plant. Noted French botanist and plant collector Jean Michel Claude Richard falsely claimed to have discovered the technique three or four years earlier, but by the end of the 20th century, Albius was considered the true discoverer.\nHe was the father of Charles Jacques \u00c9douard Morren. Morren and his son produced the journal La Belgique Horticole (35 volumes, 1851\u20131885).\nMorren also coined the term phenology, which refers to the scientific discipline that studies the seasonal cycles of animals and plants.  Morren first used the term phenology in 1849 during a public lecture at the Academy of Brussels.  The first use of the term phenology in a scientific paper dates back to 1853 when Morren published \u201cSouvenirs ph\u00e9nologiques de l\u2019hiver 1852-1853\u201d (\u201cPhenological memories of the winter 1852-1853\u201d).  This paper describes an exceptionally warm winter when plants exhibited unusually phenological patterns.\n\nThis botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation C.Morren when citing a botanical name."

He was named to Eastern Mennonite's athletic hall of fame in 1988. \nSheets was selected as the first of the Orioles' four picks in the second round (29th overall) of the 1978 MLB draft, nineteen slots ahead of Cal Ripken Jr. His lack of enthusiasm and commitment to the sport while in the minors frustrated Orioles scouts and officials and was chronicled in an article written by Alexander Wolff in the June 15, 1981 issue of Sports Illustrated. In a 13\u201311 loss to the Texas Rangers at Memorial Stadium on August 6, 1986 which was the first-ever game in MLB history that featured three grand slams, Sheets and Jim Dwyer each hit one in the fourth inning off Bobby Witt and Jeff Russell respectively. Toby Harrah had hit the first one of the contest off Ken Dixon two innings earlier in the second. After six seasons in Baltimore, Sheets was dealt to the Tigers for Mike Brumley on January 10, 1990 in a transaction where the Orioles sacrificed a much-needed power hitter for a younger, less expensive player.Sheets had career highs in batting average (.316), home runs (31) and RBIs (94) in 1987.\nSheets used to operate a youth sports facility in Westminster, Maryland, and serves as Gilman School's head Varsity Baseball coach.\nHe has a son named Gavin who plays for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB)"

On 12 February 1885, he was given the rank of captain in the army. Gambier-Parry participated as a special service officer in the Suakin Expedition of March 1885 commanded by Major-General Sir Gerald Graham VC, following the Siege of Khartoum, to avenge the murder of General Charles George Gordon in January 1885.The moments before Gordon's death and beheading were portrayed in the painting General Gordon's Last Stand (pictured) by George William Joy.The Suakin Expedition was also an attempt to change the course of the Mahdist War. During the Eastern Sudan campaign of March 1885, Captain Gambier-Parry was seriously wounded. That military campaign in the Sudan was the subject of his published work Suakin, 1885, which he penned during his convalescence. In the preface to that book, he requested \"the indulgence of critics . . . on behalf of one who has carried a sword more often than a pen.\" He was appointed as a captain in the reserve of officers on 28 October 1885, and was subsequently promoted to the honorary rank of major on 7 May 1886 for his gallant conduct.

He was a member of the Gloucester Committee of the Three Choirs Festival. He often exhibited his paintings at the Royal Academy and other venues. Gambier-Parry assumed the role of family archivist. He was reluctant to sell the collection of paintings and other art objects that his father had collected over his lifetime. (His younger son Mark similarly attempted to avoid the attention of dealers and instead bequeathed the Gambier-Parry collection intact to the Courtauld Institute of Art.)The Gambier-Parry archive included an 1897 inventory of the estate that Ernest Gambier-Parry compiled and was used in the research of the collection for the Courtauld Institute. His inventory documented prominent members of the art world who were friends of his father and viewed the collection. They included two presidents of the Royal Academy: Sir Frederic Leighton and Sir Edward John Poynter. The former selected works from the collection in 1888 to show in the Royal Academy's Winter Exhibition. After his father's death, Gambier-Parry extended invitations to art experts to view the collection at Highnam.

She later commented that her religious upbringing had a significant impact on her: \"It totally influences everything I do. I think I have serious latent Catholic guilt issues.\" Her parents divorced when she was 11 years old, after which her mother remarried. Through her mother's remarriage, she has two stepbrothers, one of whom is a member of the hip hop duo LNDN DRGS and performs under the name Jay Worthy.In 2006, Grimes graduated from Lord Byng Secondary School and relocated from Vancouver to Montreal to attend McGill University's joint Bachelor of Arts and Science program. \"I was studying general Arts and Science degree, but I was in the electro-acoustics program,\" she said in early interviews. However, she later claimed to have studied neuroscience. She was expelled in December 2010 for skipping classes."

She and her stepbrother, who raps under the name Jay Worthy, collaborated on the single \"Christmas Song\", released on the Rough Trade bonus disc of her Visions album.In 2009, Grimes and a friend attempted to sail down the Mississippi River to New Orleans from Minneapolis in a houseboat they built. Following several mishaps, including engine trouble and encounters with law enforcement, the houseboat was impounded by the city of Minneapolis. Grimes claims that elements of the story were exaggerated in the newspapers that reported on it at the time. The adventure has been turned into an animated video narrated by T-Bone Burnett.Grimes has been open about her past drug usage, revealing intense periods during the creation of her third album, Visions in 2012, during which she \"blacked out the windows and did tons of amphetamine and stayed up for three weeks and didn't eat anything.\" In 2014, she wrote a blog post expressing her aversion to hard drugs.Grimes embraces her distinctive lisp and has expressed no desire for speech therapy to alter it. Grimes has claimed that she is autistic, saying she was previously misdiagnosed with restless legs syndrome and schizoaffective disorder. She described personal motor-skill issues when \"[she] went to check [her] kids and performed worse than them on every test\".In a May 2023 interview, Grimes stated that she \"kinda like[s] the patriarchy\", saying it was the vehicle that brought civilization although \"it's sort of oppressive\" and \"almost all the systems of modernity [are] broken\". The same year, after members of the r/grimezs subreddit documented her affiliations with far-right figures, Grimes responded that she was \"proud of white culture\". \u201cI\u2019m called a Nazi because I happily am proud of white culture,\u201d she tweeted.

He is known to have spent a number of years living in a cave that he dug out himself on the banks of the Volga River not far from Nizhny Novgorod. Later, Dionysius founded the Pechersky Monastery on that same spot, which was dedicated in honour of the Ascension of the Lord. In 1374, he was consecrated the Bishop of Suzdal and won love and respect on the part of the locals.\nIn 1378, Dionysius was recommended as Metropolitan of Kyiv by St. Sergius of Radonezh after the death of Metropolitan Alexius. However, Grand Prince Dmitri Donskoi had his own candidate \u2013 a priest by the name of Mikhail (Mityaya). Dionysius was one of a number of bishops at the council who opposed Mikhail, who was suspected of heresy (Strigolniki). If elected, Mikhail wanted to introduce a new way of enthroning the Metropolitan at home, in Russia, rather than traveling to Constantinople to be installed by the Ecumenical Patriarch (at the time, Russia was not yet an autocephalous church). In 1379 Dionysius went to Constantinople carrying a protest against the choice of Mikhail addressed to the Patriarch. Mikhail was afraid that Dionysius would get the patriarch's blessing and followed him to Constantinople. However, Mikhail died on his way there and one of his accompanying clergymen, Archmandrite Pimen, reached Constantinople (Slavonic: Tzargrad) before Dionysius and was named Metropolitan of Moscow and All Rus' in place of Mikhail.\nIn 1382 the Dionysius received the title of archbishop from the Patriarch, who was impressed with his piety and humility. In 1383, Dionysius returned from this long journey to his congregation at Suzdal and continued his struggle against the Strigolniki. He also implored Dmitri Donskoi against Pimen, whom he viewed as a usurper, since no one in the Russian Church, not even the Great Prince himself, had been consulted before Pimen was appointed Metropolitan. In 1384, Dionysius was sent back to Constantinople to ask for Pimen's deposition and his own appointment as Metropolitan. Patriarch Neilus Kerameus was not sure whether he could trust Dionysius and sent two metropolitans to Moscow, who were supposed to depose Pimen and install the archbishop of Suzdal. On his way back to Moscow, Dionysius stopped in Kiev, where he was detained by the Kievan prince Vladimir Olgerdovich at the insistence of Cyprian, Archbishop of Kiev, who was to have succeeded as Metropolitan of Moscow in 1378 upon the death of Alexius, but who was not finally welcomed into Moscow until 1390. Dionysius died in detention on 15 October 1385. He was buried in the Caves of St. Anthony at Kiev, in the monastery in which he began his spiritual life.\nThe Russian Orthodox Church used to celebrate his feast day on 19 July, but subsequently this tradition died down. He is now commemorated on 15 October of the traditional Julian Calendar (28 October on the modern Gregorian Calendar), where he is listed as \"Metropolitan of Suzdal\", since he was never able to take possession of his Metropolitan See."

His first major stock car race was at Lakewood Speedway near Atlanta, Georgia on November 11, 1938; he was credited with a fifth-place finish. He would go on to dominate the 1939 racing season, being credited with the \"national championship\", which was at the time essentially an honorary title; he won races at the Daytona Beach Road Course in 1939, then again in 1940, setting a race record speed of 76.53 mph (123.16 km/h); Hall used a unique driving style that saw Hall driving on two wheels through the course's turns. Hall would win the 1941 national stock car championship following the death of teammate Lloyd Seay, another cousin.Following World War II, Hall returned to racing.  In the first stock car race held after World War II, Hall beat Bill France, Sr. to win the inaugural race at Seminole Speedway in the fall of 1945; he was declared the champion of the abbreviated 1945 stock car racing season. Hall would beat France again on the Daytona course in June 1946, leading to France choosing to retire from driving in favor of promoting races exclusively. Not long afterward, he was arrested, charged, and convicted for a $40,000 bank robbery that took place near Atlanta; sentenced to six years in prison, Hall was released after three years for good behavior. Hardened by the experience, Hall returned to compete in the newly formed NASCAR Strictly Stock series at North Wilkesboro Speedway in October 1949, finishing sixth; two weeks later  NASCAR Modified race at Tri-City Speedway, Hall suffered a serious accident, leaving him in the hospital for over a month.Hall would return to the track at Darlington Raceway in 1952, driving a DeSoto in the Southern 500 and finishing forty-eighth in a field of sixty-six cars; he would drive only one further race in his career, at Lakewood Speedway in 1960, where he crashed. He then retired, becoming a car dealer in Atlanta, and died in 1991."

        "content": "by Stevan Vukovi\u0107\n\u201cThe author and the work are only the starting points of an analysis whose horizon is a language: there cannot be a science of Dante, Shakespeare, or Racine but only a science of discourses.\u201d\nRoland Barthes\nUro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107\u2019s strong presence in the popular media as a public personality, and his very charismatic appearance, constitute the major obstacles in grasping the specificity of the discourses he develops in order to intervene in the field of contemporary art and culture. What usually happens when his works, especially the ones that feature images of himself, are interpreted without insight into the grammar of visual language and into the conceptual strategies he uses, can easily be designated as a \u201cnaturalistic mistake\u201d. It consists of equating micro-histories of his personal biography, as the biography of an empirical person who is the author of certain artworks, with the narratives that make up the visual content of those works, and with the features of the represented characters. The fact that he gets engaged with popular culture both in the fields of subcultures and of cultural industries (as an actor, radio host, underground punk musician), and in the field of critical and experimental visual art (as an author who recycles samples and schematics of popular culture in his work, which is mostly figural) gets condensed into a view of his works as functioning as \u201cthe organic representations\u201d of those mechanisms of cultural production and of those subcultures.\n\u201cIt is about the projection of personality as a mediator of ideas\u201d, said Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 in an interview published in 1996, explaining the role of his own image in the paintings he was producing at the time, adding that the \u201cself-portrait makes it a historically determined model, the specific feature being that, in this case, the image of the author is activated as a part of the content by being included in the representation\u201d.  From this quote, it is quite clear that, at least on the level of intentionality, the image of the author is not used as a simple mirror-image of himself or of his identity belongings and affiliations, but as a tool for conceptual manoeuvres. Therefore, Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 may appear as an \u201corganic intellectual\u201d, in the sense of visually codifying and making more coherent, presenting and making more broadly present in the public, a specific shared non-hegemonic and, both culturally and socially, underrepresented world-view \u201cin a way that is directive and organizational, i.e. educative, i.e. intellectual\u201d,  but he does not do that as someone who enters the field of art from the outside. He does that as an artist fully belonging to it, and being formed by it, and within it. Thereby, he acts in a synthetic manner, as a link between the life worlds where minor cultures are developed, and the elitist art world, as defined in its hegemonic role. Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 even made that clear himself in a discussion with the local art critic and art journalist Danijela Pure\u0161evi\u0107, by stating the following: \u201cI use figuration the way Duchamp used ready-made. I use figuration dually. And I am not a figurative painter. I am a pure conceptualist\u201d.\nUro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 is not a punk who paints. He performs conceptual manoeuvres by using a specific \u201cpainterly style\u201d (or \u201cstyle of representation\u201d in his later works that are not paintings) treated as a ready-made. That enables him to resample different historical styles without actually paying tribute either to the artists who originally used them or to the actual times and contexts of use. He uses the surface of the painting, drawing, photography or a digital collage as a screen for projecting, not his own empirically and psychologically framed visions and desires, but those specific social issues that go far beyond what is screened in the public media or conventionally shown in major art shows. By using his own image in paintings, photographs, and digital collages, he produces an art of signs, an art of discourse, questioning the effects of visual images on the usual perception of identity, history and culture, and testing the implications of the use of these images for the art system and the models of perception of artworks as such. The subjectivity he demonstrates is not simply taken for granted but is already \u201cdeconstructed, taken apart, and shifted, without anchorage\u201d.  It is rooted in language and effective in the realm of the symbolic. In his work, he places his self-representations at quite a distance from the psycho-biographic realm, which would be just visualized. As Roland Barthes stated, the life of the author cannot be considered as \u201cthe origin of his fables, but a fable that runs concurrently with his work.\u201d\nAutonomism and Populism\n\nIn 1994, Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 wrote, together with Stevan Marku\u0161, a manifesto entitled \u201cThe Autonomism Manifesto\u201d. It was written in February and March 1994, and published as a leaflet, to be later included in the catalogue of their joint exhibition, held in Pan\u010devo in June 1995. \u201cIt was created to reduce to a minimum the possibility of shallow stories about our painting\u201d, stated their text of the Manifesto, referring to the history of its own making. Going back to the experiences of the local historical avant-gardes, namely, Zenitism, whose manifesto these artists not only quoted in their own manifesto but even claimed to repeat, they looked for a way to avoid being listed among the \u201curban section\u201d of \u201cfigurative painters\u201d, following the \u201cother line\u201d of former Yugoslav art, who institutionalized those practices within the histories of neo-avant-gardes, of neo-constructivists, conceptual and process art movements, considered to be tendencies of \u201cradical\u201d,  as opposed to \u201csoft\u201d modernism. They also did not feel quite comfortable with the concept of \u201cmonumental intimism\u201d,  which placed them amongst the authors active in the \u201cinterspace between high art and the underground\u201d,  with \u0110ile Markovi\u0107 and Zoran Marinkovi\u0107, in the close proximity of authors such as Daniel Glid and Jasmina Kali\u0107. Their use of images was more denaturalized than those of the artists who were reputedly stylistically close to them. Their relationship with the \u201cunderground\u201d, on the other hand, was on the level of repetition of visual samples that were part of the imagery of empowerment, but in a context that was not the context of subcultures \u2013 they played with different rhetorical operations within the language of art, but materialized mainly as paintings of conventional format, and executed in conventional techniques, like oil on canvas. \u201cWe are classics\u201d, they stated, in an ironic manner, while they were still students, and they said that in order to oppose classifications.  They wanted histories of their own, ones that escape the constraints of theory-led production, art-historian-dominated interpretation, and exhibiting within the framework imposed by curators. They wanted to create the context in which their work is produced, viewed and exhibited. That was Autonomism.\nIn the late nineties, Uro\u0161 \u0110uri\u0107 started exhibiting mainly without Stevan Marku\u0161. He switched his preferred techniques from oil painting and charcoal drawing to electronic collages, photographs, performances and whatever else might come as the most appropriate medium for the realization of some concrete project. What he kept was a passionate attachments to self-portraits, so that his own image still played the \u201ctheoretical object\u201d in most of the works, only the process and the final result were much more open with respect to the manner of realization that before. His major project for the end of the nineties, and the project through which he developed another referential frame for his works, was entitled The Populist Project. As the author stated himself, the main objective of the project was to show the interaction between the star system and identity. Its components were titled God Loves the Dreams of Serbian Artists, Celebrities, Hometown Boys and Pioneers. The images of the author featured in different segments of the project, presenting him as part of the most prominent football teams in Europe, in the company of various public personalities, on the cover of an imaginary magazine entitled \u201cHometown Boys\u201d, and among the most prominent authors in the field of art production and interpretation from what was once geopolitically labelled as Eastern Europe, all of whom were shown as proudly wearing a red pioneer scarf, in a glorious posture taken from the iconography of socialist realism. With this project, he went against the stereotypical social and political, not so much art-historical framing of his works. While most left-wing scholars in Serbia dealt with the issue of populism as determined to serve the right wing ideology, he demonstrated that populism had no pre-articulated social implication, and that in order to enter the struggle in the public arena, one has to be able to articulate it. His manner of articulation was rooted in the antagonistic potential of all the popular interpellations, connecting his populist project with the heritage of populist anarchism, which reappeared locally on the grass roots level whenever the local population was to be turned into members of a nation, party, etc. Instead of producing representations of all the invisible parts of the society within the field of art, which is the prevailing paradigm of socially specific works, he went directly into the populist media to work on antagonizing the attitudes towards the public images of celebrities, including his own, using those media the way he used canvas.\nIntegral version of the text was published in: Umelec international 3/2006"

Irene lost her rights of succession to the Dutch throne because the government refused to enact a law permitting the marriage. Her mother could not go to Madrid to talk Irene out of the marriage and of her conversion to Catholicism because the government advised her against it. The issue that prevented the government from making a law permitting the marriage was Carlos's claim to the Spanish throne. The Dutch government saw international political difficulties arising from a possible heir to the Dutch throne holding a controversial claim to the throne of a foreign state.Carlos Hugo and Irene were married on 29 April 1964, in the Borghese Chapel at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, by Cardinal Paolo Giobbe, the former Apostolic Nuncio to the Netherlands. No other members of the Dutch royal family were present; Irene's parents watched the ceremony on television. After the ceremony, Carlos Hugo and Irene had a private audience with Pope Paul VI.

Initially she partnered with her 16-year-old younger brother Matthias Andreas Stein (1776-1842) under the business name Geschwister Stein.  After 1802, she and her brother parted company, and she continued building pianos under her name (Nannette Streicher n\u00e9e Stein). With the support of her husband and from 1824 to 1825 with their son, Johann Baptist (1796\u20131871) as a partner, the business became an important piano manufacturer.  They produced 50 to 65 grand pianos each year. Johann Baptist Streicher was the sole owner of the factory, which under his leadership acquired many patents and became world famous. The company was sold in 1896 to the brothers Stingl.\nTwo fine instruments by Streicher are in the collection of Scenkonstmuseet (earlier known as Musikmuseet) in Stockholm, Sweden.

During that time, he penned at least 110 novels and a further 3 collections of short stories all mostly in the 'Western' genre of writing. \nThat he is not better known as a writer is likely due to the fact that Hollywood movie makers were not exactly beating down his door to turn his many writings into Hollywood movies. Indeed only 2 Hollywood movies credit Patten as a source for their movie, the 1956 Movie Red Sundown, and the 1969 Movie Death of a Gunfighter. The later 1971 Movie Long Live Your Death, which featured the noted actors Eli Wallach and Lynn Redgrave, cheated this unofficial Hollywood boycott of Patten by actually being a non-Hollywood so-called Spaghetti Western. The tragedy of Hollywood movie makers just thumbing their noses at Patten continued with the 1969 Movie The Undefeated starring the then famed actors John Wayne and Rock Hudson, a movie which even failed to credit Patten as an inspiration for this particular major movie - see below under 'Films'."

Since 2005, she has been working on sound research in the fields of vocalism and electronic music, and since 2013 she has been working as blues singer as well.\nIn 2005 she has been awarded with the Demetrio Stratos International Prize for musical experimentation for the emerging artist best project, proposing the project Diffrazioni Sonore (RDM, 2005\u20132010).\nThe Career Awards have been received by Diamanda Gal\u00e1s in 2005, Meredith Monk in 2007, Fred Frith in 2008, and F\u00e1tima Miranda in 2009.She has been a finalist at \u2018Premio Nazionale delle Arti' (Arts National Award) for Electronic Music and New Technologies, presenting the composition for voice and electronics La Prova, taken from her second record Aisth\u00e0nomai, il Dramma della Coscienza (RDM, 2008\u20132010) in 2010 edition, and presenting the electro-acoustic composition La Natura Assente in 2011 edition.In 2011 she has been awarded with the 'Arci Award' for musical experimentation\npromoted by the Italian contemporary music centre \"Centro Musica Contemporanea\" in collaboration with the Italian cultural associations Arci, presenting a preview from her new work titled Spannung. The related concert took place at the big stage area of \"Carroponte\" (Sesto San Giovanni, Milan) in July 2011. The project has been presented in its different stages during the last performances as well, while detailed information has been given by the artist on the occasion of the 'Arci Award'.Between 2006 and 2012, she presented her work and research at many prestigious festival like Arezzo Wave, Electronika Festival Aterforum Festival \u2013 during the meeting with Meredith Monk, 5 Giornate per la Nuova Musica Festival \u2013 with which she has been collaborating since 2008, Salone Internazionale del Libro; London Hoxton Festival; Intermidia Festival \u2013 Slovakia; gaining attention from the international press as well.In the middle of 2013, she founded the band with which mainly pays homage to the greatest women of rhythm and blues, \"to bring back and bring up that unique and originary strength, passion and pain, today forgotten especially in Europe; that is one thing with my deeper work\". \nThe band has been performing since May 2013 all over the Milan area.As she said, \"the Blues is at the center as feeling and intention in a variety of styles that will allow us to cross \u2013 within the limits of our ability \u2013 the twentieth century, from Swing to Fusion\". (Romina Daniele on One TV)Between electronics and vocal experimentation, live studio session in solo and with the band, extended vocalism and blues, her latest record is a triple cd titled Spannung produced between 2009 and 2015, and released on December the 24th 2015. The book Voce Sola \u2013 essay on the vocal discourse to be released in 2016 \u2013 has been written during the same years."

        "content": "Daniele was born and grown in Naples, where she studied classic dance and classic guitar, and started to write poems, tales, songs, to paint and to photograph since she was a child. In the Nineties she participated to exhibitions and was noted and mentioned by local and national magazines. The poems written between 1995 and 2005 are today part of the collected poems book Poesie 1995\u20132005, English and Italian bilingual edition (RDM, 2010).After the studies on Art criticism, aesthetics and Cinema at the University of Naples Suor Orsola Benincasa, and that in vocals with Auli Kokko (singer for Daniele Sepe's band), Daniele focuses herself in musical activity moving to Milan in 2005, where \"the climate for experimental singing is more receptive\", and where she received the Stratos Prize and has gone through different professional experiences as well.\nDuring the academic year 2006\u20132007 she teaches the results of her vocal research included in the record Diffrazioni Sonore at \"Crams School of Music\" in Lecco (Italy), working for collective experimental laboratories, concerts, and individual lessons as well.\nDiffrazioni Sonore, released in 2005 and her first album project, \"consists entirely of multi-tracked, and entirely improvised vocal music, some of it treated digitally (radical EQ, echo, and a little reverb), but otherwise left well enough alone\", and is focused on the relationship between improvisation and construction.The second record Aisth\u00e0nomai, il Dramma della Coscienza, released in 2008, for voice and electronics, is focused on sound research in the fields of vocalism and electronic music, including compositions with texts in Italian, English and French. Consisting of textual philosophizing more abundantly, it can be read like a theoretical work, an organized anthology and a poetical-musical form.As Rick Moody writes, Daniele's approach seems to come more from the wilds of literature, and particularly from the wilds of European philosophy, than from any rigorous background in music. Both the two released records are, in fact, loaded with literature references, as a quick look at the booklets points out. They both include \"theoretical line texts\" which look like essays or manifestos; on one hand these essays explain the foundation of Daniele's musical activity, coming mostly from contemporary philosophy, in particular from the French philosophy by Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes and the theoretic-linguistic vision by Pier Paolo Pasolini; on the other hand, as Dionisio Capuano remarks, \"her theoretic will can hamper the total fruition\".In the interviews Daniele declares herself to be devoted to \"feeding doubt and a whirlpool of feelings, my primarily aim is structuring thought: a human one.\" Otherwise, music with new technologies is elected as research device, superior to every other one, in the study on the human being; in the same way, the voice is the most powerful mean of human expression, from an anthropological, physiological, and linguistic point of view, and just secondly a musical instrument.\nIn particular:\n\nDiffrazioni Sonore is a result of the research I have been conducting since 2000 in a number of areas: voice, composition by electronic means, philosophy applied to multimedia. Studying film history and theory, art criticism and aesthetic analysis, I approached the fields of thought that my research is based on, which include Gilles Deleuze\u2019s philosophy and Michel Chion\u2019s theory applied to film, a multimedia art form. I am referring specifically to the linguistic and morphological foundations of my work, by virtue of the relationship between, and coexistence among, different languages, including voice, poetry, writing, music, electronics, art, thought, man. (Romina Daniele on the Rumpus)\nIn an interview on the Rockerilla magazine, she also mentioned film-makers and painters as influences for her musical work: \"Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Marcel Proust, Friederich Nietzsche and Henri Bergson, Jusepe de Ribera and Francis Bacon, David Lynch and Michelangelo Antonioni.\"Between 2006 and 2008, during the work on her second record Daniele wrote the essay Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud, Il luogo della musica nell'audiovisione (RDM, 2011), in English: the site of music in Audio-Vision, title which reminds to two previous studies, one is the Site of Film by Christian Metz\n, the other is Audio-Vision by Michel Chion. As a matter of fact, the essay is the dissertation thesis with which Daniele degreed Cum Laude in Cinema Studies, supervised by professor Augusto Sainati from the Sorbonne of Paris, who has been studying the cinema combining the semiotic analysis and the historical and sociological points of view for a long time. Daniele's thesis is focused on the relationship between music and image in the cinema, conducted through the detailed analysis of the French movie Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud (1959) by Louis Malle, with soundtrack by Miles Davis. Furthermore, Daniele honours the Davis soundtrack covering the piece Nuit sur les Champs-\u00e9lys\u00e9es in the second record.At the end of 2008, she starts studying electronic music, as post graduate studies, at the Milan Conservatory, which led her to one of the finalists for the 'National Award of Arts' in 2010 and 2011.In the same year she also starts working in the field of silent movies screened with live improvisations by a collaboration with Riccardo Sinigaglia Electro-acoustic ensemble.Between the 2008 and 2011 she dedicated herself to literature production, publishing the books mentioned above and the essay Il dialogo con la materia disintegrata e ricomposta, un'analisi di Thema (Omaggio a Joyce) di Luciano Berio (RDM, 2010). It is an analysis of Thema (Omaggio a Joyce) by Luciano Berio, described as the first electro-acoustic composition in the history of western music made entirely with voice and elaboration of it by technological means. The voice was that of the great American avant-garde singer Cathy Berberian, reading from the Ulysses by James Joyce. Thus, this book is categorized as a biography, and also as an autobiography as can be found in Google Books. On the other hand, Daniele has been working on the essay Voce Sola (Solo Voice) for some years, a book describing her aesthetic and linguistic research in all fields of her activity, mostly focused on music and vocalism.Considering the contemporary western music and its twentieth-century history from the Musique concr\u00e8te to the experimental music, to the most recent experiences on technology applied to music, her work seems focused on a kind of electronic music as sound research or sound art.\nFrom the vocal point of view her work is focused on the transfiguration of the song form through the organic changing of the voice, vocals-electronics assimilation, the dramatic experimentation on the text-vocals, sound poetry and the total theatre-song:\nA peculiar combination of different disciplines including theatre, philosophy, aesthetics and electronics used as a movie soundtrack, can be seen as a real opera of avant-garde theatre. Romina Daniele put herself in front of the audience stimulating it and producing a thrilling and a charming sound with vocals creating dark/shining atmospheres throwing the listener in a lyrics-voice-music spiral that oblige us to confront with ourselves. (Alessio Arena on Drexkode)\nAlthough, as Moody remarks, Daniele's work \"is not only complex, only demanding, only methodical, but, actually, though it has its challenges, it is also playful, sweet, sometimes funny, and, on occasion, rooted in an appreciation of vernacular music like jazz, blues, and pop.\"In fact, speaking about her Blues live concerts, Romina Daniele said:\n\nI am doing the Blues today because I feel it like a shear, vertical push that starts from the inside, comes out from every pore and goes straight to the heart. And this is one thing at the base of my work, which very often has been positively welcomed in the contemporary avant-garde fields and similar, where sometime, it can happen, the fundamental things of life are lost which indeed are the strength and the instinctivity of the emotions. (Romina Daniele on Rock n Roll Radio) \nBetween 2009 and 2012 she studies New Technologies and Electronic Music at the Milan Conservatory. And so, as said before, she represented the Conservatorio di Milano at the final stage of \u2018Premio Nazionale delle Arti' (Arts National Award) 2010 and 2011 editions. She studied with Riccardo Sinigaglia, Alessandro Melchiorre, Giovanni Cospito; she has attended many workshops and seminars among which we can mention those of Meredith Monk, Trevor Wishart, David Moss and Annette Vande Gorne.\nRDM Records was born in 2010 through her collaboration, with the purpose of promoting research and the technical and aesthetic autonomy.The title of her latest record is Spannung, from German: tension, opening of the research. Particularly significant in this work is the cycle of the Dasein, divided in three parts and themes, which is the title of her 2010\u20132012 performances as well. Dasein, from German as well: being; in Martin Heidegger's philosophy: being the here, to be at stake of one's being into the being itself.As Romina Daniele said, both the record and the book Voce Sola \u2013 essay on the vocal discourse:\n\n indicates the opening, the space, the tension (and the yearning) of being in the size of the authenticity of existence, that is what we are and are looking for: to be at stake of one\u2019s being into the being itself with everything of us into the world before it goes away in vain. Voice is what there was at the beginning, a question of body and thought, the focus and the cornerstone, and there are no other places or sounds like that at all. Then music is an essential act concerning the apprehension for man and his work as well."

        "content": "Xie Hui started his professional football career with Shanghai Shenhua in the 1994 season. After excelling with Shenhua for six seasons in the late 90s where he won one top-tier league title and a Chinese FA Cup, Xie Hui transferred to 2nd Bundesliga club Alemannia Aachen in January 2000. During the 2000\u201301 season, Xie Hui was the top scorer for Aachen with fourteen goals in twenty-four league appearances.  The following season Xie Hui netted only once in thirteen appearances and because of this drop in performance, he went back to Shanghai Shenhua on loan in March 2002 to gain more first team experience and to keep his place on the China national football team. When his loan finished he transferred to another German second-tier club in SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth in August 2002, however after only netting only once in eight league appearances for Greuther F\u00fcrth, Xie Hui came back to China to play for Chongqing Lifan in 2003.\nFor the third time he rejoined Shenhua in December 2004 on a permanent basis where he once again revived his career and after two years with Shenhua, Xie headed back to Germany when he joined another second tier German club SV Wehen Wiesbaden on January 1, 2008, on an 18-month contract. When his contract ended Xie would once again return to Shenhua on January 6, 2009, for a testimonial. After the game he officially retired from football and soon became an assistant manager at Shenhua. He was hired by Shanghai SIPG Football club as an assistant coach.\nOn August 18, 2021, while Xie Hui was the manager of Nantong Zhiyun, a leaked video of him dining with colleagues revealed his controversial comments towards management and coaching staff of other competing teams. He later was suspended by Nantong Zhiyun. After apologizing on his comments, he resigned from his manager role at the club.On March 19, 2022, Xie Hui was appointed as the manager of Dalian Professional. During the first year of his management, the team was initially planning to play in the China League One (the second level of professional soccer in China) due to the relegation from Chinese Super League in previous season. However, as Chongqing Liangjiang Athletic in the Chinese Super League dissolved before the start of the 2022 season, Dalian Professional was allowed to play in the Chinese Super League as a substitute for Chongqing Liangjiang Athletic for the 2022 season."

Karegeya earned a Bachelor of Law degree from Makerere University in Kampala, the same university attended by many post-colonial African leaders.\nLike other Tutsi exiles, including RPF founder Fred Rwigyema, Karegeya joined the National Resistance Army (NRA) in Uganda. The NRA had been fighting the Ugandan Bush War. The war was led by Yoweri Museveni who was attempting to overthrow Ugandan president Milton Obote. According to his own account, he was arrested in June 1982 and charged with treason, spending three years in jail. After serving his sentence he rejoined the NRA as a lieutenant in Ugandan military intelligence. He claims the decision to invade Rwanda was made at this time by the Tutsi exiles while Kagame was studying in the United States."

Karegeya stayed behind in Uganda to serve as a liaison between intelligence agencies of Uganda and the RPF. Following the war and the genocide, Karegeya took up a position as head of intelligence for the RPF's new government in Rwanda. From 1994 to 2004, he held the post of Director General, External Intelligence in the Rwandan Defence Forces.During his decade in charge of intelligence, Rwanda was involved in complex fighting both internally and in the eastern Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo). Many Hutu, both Interahamwe (the group most responsible for the genocide) and innocent civilians, were packed into refugee camps on the Zaire-Rwanda border. This led to the creation of a large variety of militia groups being backed by different regional powers in the First and Second Congo War. Karegeya had a large role in coordinating intelligence for these wars and for dissident suppression at home.Karegeya was arrested and served an 18-month sentence for desertion and insubordination. He was stripped of his rank of colonel on 13 July 2006 by a military tribunal and fled the country in 2007. Later, Kagame claimed that Karegeya was in the pay of South African military intelligence.In August 2010, Karegeya told the Ugandan paper, The Observer, that Kagame was a dictator who would not leave power unless he was forced out by war.\nThe same month, he told the BBC that Kagame had ordered a series of political killings."

Reports indicated that he had gone to attend a meeting at the hotel. The circumstances leading to his death remain unknown. The South African police are conducting investigations although the Rwandan opposition party, the Rwanda National Congress (RNC) said in a statement to AFP that \"He was strangled by agents of [Rwandan President Paul] Kagame,\" having previously survived several assassination attempts. Karegeya left behind his wife Leah and three children.\nSome days after his killing, Paul Kagame, in an apparent reference to Karegeya's murder, said that \"You can't betray Rwanda and not get punished for it [...] Anyone, even those still alive, will reap the consequences. Anyone. It is a matter of time.\". When confronted, Kagame denied responsibility, but added that \"I actually wish Rwanda did it. I really wish it.\"It was reported in the South African press that Karegeya had agreed to dispense with his South African security detail in 2012. The government of South Africa had provided the protection since Karegeya\u2019s arrival in South Africa in 2007. The decision to provide protection was reportedly influenced by assassination attempts against former army chief of staff Kayumba Nyamwasa, another Rwandan exile in South Africa.Karegeya's family has accused South Africa of covering up his murder.In January 2019, a state prosecutor launched an inquest into the assassination. The hope was to issue arrest warrants for the suspects who are believed to have fled back to Rwanda. On 19 January 2019, the Randburg Magistrates Court ruled that it was striking the murder inquest from its rolls as the prosecution had not produced any suspects."

        "content": "Dudok initially chose to pursue a military career. At the military academy of Breda he studied civil engineering and was allowed to assist in designing military buildings. Influenced by other Dutch architects, such as Berlage, he rapidly proved able to adapt his own ideas. He was appointed Assistant Director of Public Works in Leiden in 1913 and Director of Public Works in Hilversum in 1915. He was appointed Hilversum's Municipal Architect in 1928. The same year he was assigned the task of expanding the city, which involved designing housing estates, schools, swimming pools and parks and gardens. While his early style in Hilversum grew out of the Amsterdam School, the dramatic massing, asymmetry, the overhanging eaves and other elements of his landmark Hilversum City Hall were clearly influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright and the Chicago Prairie School. The City Hall is regarded as his masterpiece and manages to merge the requirements of being both a symbol of the city and an efficient administrative building. It is indicative of the garden-city character of Hilversum. Indeed, Dudok was clearly influenced by Ebenezer Howard and Raymond Unwin, pioneers of the garden-city movement in the United Kingdom. Dudok continued to produce progressive, Dutch modernist structures in Hilversum for decades, through the 1960s, and had international influence. Amongst school designers in the Netherlands, his schools in Hilversum became particularly celebrated.Dudok was also the architect of the branch of the De Bijenkorf department store in Rotterdam, a spectacular piece of commercial architecture clearly influenced by the Bauhaus, de Stijl, and the streamlining that was popular in both Art Deco and Art Moderne modernist design of the 1920s and 1930s. When it opened in 1930, some 70,000 people attended the event. While it was partly destroyed in the German bombing of Rotterdam in May 1940 during the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands, numerous photographs, plans and other material documenting the structure's design and the structure have survived and recently aided in the production of a Dutch documentary on Dudok's department store.Dudok received the RIBA Gold Medal in 1935 and the AIA Gold Medal in 1955. He also designed the Coll\u00e8ge n\u00e9erlandais in the Cit\u00e9 Universitaire in Paris, a cultural centre in Baghdad and a cinema in Calcutta. One of the buildings he designed in Rotterdam now houses a cafe-restaurant named after him. He drew up plans for the rebuilding of The Hague after WW2. This involved a new district for 150,000 people in the southwest of the city. He died, aged 89, in Hilversum."

Trained at the \u00c9cole des Chartes and the \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes, he made his first appearance in the world of scholarship as the author of a book called \u00c9tudes sur l'industrie et la classe industrielle \u00e0 Paris au XIIIe et au XIVe si\u00e8cle (1877). This work, composed almost entirely from documents, many unpublished, opened a new field for historical study.Twenty years later he supplemented this book by a collection of Documents relatifs \u00e0 l'histoire de l'industrie et du commerce en France (2 volumes, 1898\u20131900), and in 1897 he published L'\u00e9conomie sociale de la France sous Henri IV, a volume containing the results of very minute research. He did not, however, confine himself to economic history. His Le P\u00e8re Joseph et Richelieu (1894), though somewhat frigid and severe, is based on a mass of unpublished information, and shows remarkable psychological grasp.In 1878 his Journal parisien de Jean de Maupoint, prieur de Sainte-Catherine-de-la-Couture was published in volume iv of the M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Histoire de Paris et de l'\u00cele de France.

        "content": "Jomo Kenyatta  (c.\u20091897 \u2013 22 August 1978) was a Kenyan anti-colonial activist and politician who governed Kenya as its Prime Minister from 1963 to 1964 and then as its first President from 1964 to his death in 1978. He was the country's first president and played a significant role in the transformation of Kenya from a colony of the British Empire into an independent republic. Ideologically an African nationalist and a conservative, he led the Kenya African National Union (KANU) party from 1961 until his death.\nKenyatta was born to Kikuyu farmers in Kiambu, British East Africa. Educated at a mission school, he worked in various jobs before becoming politically engaged through the Kikuyu Central Association. In 1929, he travelled to London to lobby for Kikuyu land affairs. During the 1930s, he studied at Moscow's Communist University of the Toilers of the East, University College London, and the London School of Economics. In 1938, he published an anthropological study of Kikuyu life before working as a farm labourer in Sussex during the Second World War. Influenced by his friend George Padmore, he embraced anti-colonialist and Pan-African ideas, co-organising the 1945 Pan-African Congress in Manchester. He returned to Kenya in 1946 and became a school principal. In 1947, he was elected President of the Kenya African Union, through which he lobbied for independence from British colonial rule, attracting widespread indigenous support but animosity from white settlers. In 1952, he was among the Kapenguria Six arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial Mau Mau Uprising. Although protesting his innocence\u2014a view shared by later historians\u2014he was convicted. He remained imprisoned at Lokitaung until 1959 and was then exiled to Lodwar until 1961.\nOn his release, Kenyatta became President of KANU and led the party to victory in the 1963 general election. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the transition of the Kenya Colony into an independent republic, of which he became president in 1964. Desiring a one-party state, he transferred regional powers to his central government, suppressed political dissent, and prohibited KANU's only rival\u2014Oginga Odinga's leftist Kenya People's Union\u2014from competing in elections. He promoted reconciliation between the country's indigenous ethnic groups and its European minority, although his relations with the Kenyan Indians were strained and Kenya's army clashed with Somali separatists in the North Eastern Province during the Shifta War. His government pursued capitalist economic policies and the \"Africanisation\" of the economy, prohibiting non-citizens from controlling key industries. Education and healthcare were expanded, while UK-funded land redistribution favoured KANU loyalists and exacerbated ethnic tensions. Under Kenyatta, Kenya joined the Organisation of African Unity and the Commonwealth of Nations, espousing a pro-Western and anti-communist foreign policy amid the Cold War. Kenyatta died in office and was succeeded by Daniel arap Moi. Kenyatta's son Uhuru later also became president.\nKenyatta was a controversial figure. Prior to Kenyan independence, many of its white settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, he was given the honorary title of Mzee and lauded as the Father of the Nation, securing support from both the black majority and the white minority with his message of reconciliation. Conversely, his rule was criticised as dictatorial, authoritarian, and neocolonial, of favouring Kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of facilitating the growth of widespread corruption."

        "content": "Kenyatta was an African nationalist, and was committed to the belief that European colonial rule in Africa must end. Like other anti-colonialists, he believed that under colonialism, the human and natural resources of Africa had been used not for the benefit of Africa's population but for the enrichment of the colonisers and their European homelands. For Kenyatta, independence meant not just self-rule, but an end to the colour bar and to the patronising attitudes and racist slang of Kenya's white minority. According to Murray-Brown, Kenyatta's \"basic philosophy\" throughout his life was that \"all men deserved the right to develop peacefully according to their own wishes\". Kenyatta expressed this in his statement that \"I have stood always for the purposes of human dignity in freedom, and for the values of tolerance and peace.\" This approach was similar to the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda's ideology of \"African humanism\".Murray-Brown noted that \"Kenyatta had always kept himself free from ideological commitments\", while the historian William R. Ochieng observed that \"Kenyatta articulated no particular social philosophy\". Similarly, Assensoh noted that Kenyatta was \"not interested in social philosophies and slogans\". Several commentators and biographers described him as being politically conservative, an ideological viewpoint likely bolstered by his training in functionalist anthropology. He pursued, according to Maloba, \"a conservatism that worked in concert with imperial powers and was distinctly hostile to radical politics\".Kenyatta biographer Guy Arnold described the Kenyan leader as \"a pragmatist and a moderate\", noting that his only \"radicalism\" came in the form of his \"nationalist attack\" on imperialism. Arnold also noted that Kenyatta \"absorbed a great deal of the British approach to politics: pragmatism, only dealing with problems when they become crises, [and] tolerance as long as the other side is only talking\". Donald Savage noted that Kenyatta believed in \"the importance of authority and tradition\", and that he displayed \"a remarkably consistent view of development through self-help and hard work\". Kenyatta was also an elitist and encouraged the emergence of an elite class in Kenya. He wrestled with a contradiction between his conservative desire for a renewal of traditional custom and his reformist urges to embrace Western modernity. He also faced a contradiction between his internal debates on Kikuyu ethics and belief in tribal identity with his need to create a non-tribalised Kenyan nationalism."

        "content": "Kenyatta was a flamboyant character, with an extroverted personality. According to Murray-Brown, he \"liked being at the centre of life\", and was always \"a rebel at heart\" who enjoyed \"earthly pleasures\". One of Kenyatta's fellow LSE students, Elspeth Huxley, referred to him as \"a showman to his finger tips; jovial, a good companion, shrewd, fluent, quick, devious, subtle, [and] flesh-pot loving\". Kenyatta liked to dress elaborately; throughout most of his adult life, he wore finger rings and while studying at university in London took to wearing a fez and cloak and carrying a silver-topped black cane. He adopted his surname, \"Kenyatta\", after the name of a beaded belt he often wore in early life. As President he collected a variety of expensive cars.Murray-Brown noted that Kenyatta had the ability to \"appear all things to all men\", also displaying a \"consummate ability to keep his true purposes and abilities to himself\", for instance concealing his connections with communists and the Soviet Union both from members of the British Labour Party and from Kikuyu figures at home. This deviousness was sometimes interpreted as dishonesty by those who met him. Referring to Kenyatta's appearance in 1920s Kenya, Murray-Brown stated the leader presented himself to Europeans as \"an agreeable if somewhat seedy 'Europeanized' native\" and to indigenous Africans as \"a sophisticated man-about-town about whose political earnestness they had certain reservations\".Simon Gikandi argued that Kenyatta, like some of his contemporaries in the Pan-African movement, was an \"Afro-Victorian\", someone whose identity had been shaped \"by the culture of colonialism and colonial institutions\", especially those of the Victorian era. During the 1920s and 1930s, Kenyatta cultivated the image of a \"colonial gentleman\"; in England, he displayed \"pleasant manners\" and a flexible attitude in adapting to urban situations dissimilar to the lands he had grown up in. A. R. Barlow, a member of the Church of Scotland Mission at Kikuyu, met with Kenyatta in Britain, later relating that he was impressed by how Kenyatta could \"mix on equal terms with Europeans and to hold his end up in spite of his handicaps, educationally and socially.\" The South African Peter Abrahams met Kenyatta in London, noting that of all the black men involved in the city's Pan-Africanist movement, he was \"the most relaxed, sophisticated and 'westernized' of the lot of us\". As President, Kenyatta often reminisced nostalgically about his time in England, referring to it as \"home\" on several occasions. Berman and Lonsdale described his life as being preoccupied with \"a search for the reconciliation of the Western modernity he embraced and an equally valued Kikuyuness he could not discard\". Gikandi argued that Kenyatta's \"identification with Englishness was much more profound than both his friends and enemies have been willing to admit\".Kenyatta has also been described as a talented orator, author, and editor. He had dictatorial and autocratic tendencies, as well as a fierce temper that could emerge as rage on occasion. Murray-Brown noted that Kenyatta could be \"quite unscrupulous, even brutal\" in using others to get what he wanted, but he never displayed any physical cruelty or nihilism. Kenyatta had no racist impulses regarding white Europeans, as can, for instance, be seen through his marriage to a white English woman. He told his daughter \"the English are wonderful people to live with in England.\" He welcomed white support for his cause, so long as it was generous and unconditional, and spoke of a Kenya in which indigenous Africans, Europeans, Arabs, and Indians could all regard themselves as Kenyans, working and living alongside each other peacefully. Despite this, Kenyatta exhibited a general dislike of Indians, believing that they exploited indigenous Africans in Kenya.\n\nKenyatta was a polygamist. He viewed monogamy through an anthropological lens as an interesting Western phenomenon but did not adopt the practice himself, instead having sexual relations with a wide range of women throughout his life. Murray-Brown characterized Kenyatta as an \"affectionate father\" to his children, but one who was frequently absent. Kenyatta had two children from his first marriage with Grace Wahu: son Peter Muigai Kenyatta (born 1920), who later became a deputy minister; and daughter Margaret Kenyatta (born 1928). Margaret served as mayor of Nairobi between 1970 and 1976 and then as Kenya's ambassador to the United Nations from 1976 to 1986. Of these children, it was Margaret who was Kenyatta's closest confidante.During his trial, Kenyatta described himself as a Christian saying, \"I do not follow any particular denomination. I believe in Christianity as a whole.\" Arnold stated that in England, Kenyatta's adherence to Christianity was \"desultory\". While in London, Kenyatta had taken an interest in the atheist speakers at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, while an Irish Muslim friend had unsuccessfully urged Kenyatta to convert to Islam. During his imprisonment, Kenyatta read up on Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism through books supplied to him by Stock. The Israeli diplomat Asher Naim visited him in this period, noting that although Kenyatta was \"not a religious man, he was appreciative of the Bible\". Despite portraying himself as a Christian, he found the attitudes of many European missionaries intolerable, in particular their readiness to see everything African as evil. In Facing Mount Kenya, he challenged the missionaries' dismissive attitude toward ancestor veneration, which he instead preferred to call \"ancestor communion\". In that book's dedication, Kenyatta invoked \"ancestral spirits\" as part of \"the Fight for African Freedom.\""

        "content": "Within Kenya, Kenyatta came to be regarded as the \"Father of the Nation\", and was given the unofficial title of Mzee, a Swahili term meaning \"grand old man\". From 1963 until his death, a cult of personality surrounded him in the country, one which deliberately interlinked Kenyan nationalism with Kenyatta's own personality. This use of Kenyatta as a popular symbol of the nation itself was furthered by the similarities between their names. He came to be regarded as a father figure not only by Kikuyu and Kenyans, but by Africans more widely.After 1963, Maloba noted, Kenyatta became \"about the most admired post-independence African leader\" on the world stage, one who Western countries hailed as a \"beloved elder statesman.\" His opinions were \"most valued\" both by conservative African politicians and by Western leaders. On becoming Kenya's leader, his anti-communist positions gained favour in the West, and some pro-Western governments gave him awards; in 1965 he, for instance, received medals from both Pope Paul VI and from the South Korean government.In 1974, Arnold referred to Kenyatta as \"one of the outstanding African leaders now living\", someone who had become \"synonymous with Kenya\". He added that Kenyatta had been \"one of the shrewdest politicians\" on the continent, regarded as \"one of the great architects of African nationalist achievement since 1945\". Kenneth O. Nyangena characterised him as \"one of the greatest men of the twentieth century\", having been \"a beacon, a rallying point for suffering Kenyans to fight for their rights, justice and freedom\" whose \"brilliance gave strength and aspiration to people beyond the boundaries of Kenya\". In 2018, Maloba described him as \"one of the legendary pioneers of modern African nationalism\". In their examination of his writings, Berman and Lonsdale described him as a \"pioneer\" for being one of the first Kikuyu to write and publish; \"his representational achievement was unique\"."

He married in 1418, and in 1424 was registered in the Guild of Painters at Florence. His son, Neri di Bicci was also a painter and took over the family workshop. Bicci di Lorenzo died in Florence in 1452 and was buried in Santa Maria del Carmine.\nFollowing early work \u2013 largely frescoes \u2013 in collaboration with his father, he received a number of important commissions, including, according to Vasari, from the Medici for a cycle of frescoes of Illustrious Men for the Palazzo Medici. For the Opera del Duomo, he painted frescoes of the apostles.  And he painted a Saints Cosmas and Damian and frescoes representing the dedication of the church itself for Sant'Egidio in the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova.\nAmong his major works are an Enthroned Madonna now in the National Gallery at Parma; the Three Scenes from the Life of St Nicholas, a triptych in the cathedral of Fiesole; and a Nativity in the church of San Giovannino dei Cavalieri in Florence. He frescoed the entrance to the Compagni chapel in the church of Santa Trinita, and in the area around Florence, there are frescoes at the Oratory of Sant'Antonio Abate, Pescia; Empoli; and at Lastra a Signa.

Throughout his long life, he wasinfluenced by Lorenzo Monaco and with the relations with painters from the Marche region working in Florence, especially with Gentile da Fabriano. Gentile was inspired by the Madonna of the Quaratesi altarpiece (1425), a work by Gentile, for the one (1433) now in the Galleria di Parma (the lateral ones are in the Pinacoteca Stuart in the same city), and freely copied its predella in the execution of the stories of St. Nicholas (two in the Metropolitan Museum in New York and one in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford) that adorned the step of his dismembered work. At times, as in the Nativity (1435) of San Giovannino dei Cavalieri in Florence, he finds, with some Beato Angelico resonance, spiritual accords with the Sienese, such as Giovanni di Paolo and Sano di Pietro. In his later works he has a slightly broader formal structure, which is not, however, to be put in relation to the fact that in 1441 Bicci di Lorenzo helped Domenico Veneziano in the vanished frescoes of S. Egidio; for the Renaissance exercised no fascination on ours, who always remained resolutely Gothic."

His father was a prominent Ottawa citizen who owned Ottawa Electric and the Ottawa Electric Railway Company. He was educated at Kent Street Public School, Ottawa Collegiate and privately tutored. Around 1900, he organized the Buena Vista hockey team which played on an open-air rink at Laurier Avenue and Bronson, with an old streetcar for dressing facilities. In 1909, he married Norah Lewis, granddaughter of Archbishop John Travers Lewis and also of Sir Collingwood Schreiber.Thomas Franklin Ahearn served in World War I, as a captain in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, from 1914 until 1916, when he was injured and returned home.Mr. Ahearn became involved with the Ottawa Senators in the period when they won three Stanley Cups in four years between 1920 and 1923. In 1924, he bought out majority owner Tommy Gorman. In 1926-27, the Senators won the Cup with one of the most impressive rosters ever assembled. This imposing collection included Jack Adams, King Clancy, Alec Connell, Cy Denneny, Frank Finnigan, Hec Kilrea, Frank Nighbor and Hooley Smith.\nWinning the Stanley Cup was the last hurrah for the franchise. Due to a combination of the Great Depression and the smaller population of Ottawa, the club lost money every year after, leading the club to suspend operations for one year, move home games to other cities, and finally move to Missouri to operate as the St. Louis Eagles, and operated the Senators as an amateur/semi-professional senior club. After one season in St. Louis, the Ottawa owners sought to suspend operations again and were turned down by the league. Finally, on October 15, 1935, the Eagles and their players were bought out by the NHL, dispersing the players to other NHL teams and suspending the franchise, with a promise to pass along the proceeds if the franchise was resold. (The franchise would be reinstated eventually in 1992) In the years of his owning the Ottawa Senators, his losses were over $200,000, a loss he said he never regretted. At the time of the dissolution of the NHL franchise, Ahearn was a minority owner of the consortium which owned the Ottawa Auditorium arena and the Senators.\nLike his father, Ahearn was involved in politics, and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 1930 and 1935.\nAhearn was a vice-president of the Ottawa Light, Heat and Power Company. In 1940, he resigned to become president of the Ottawa Electric Company. He also had his own firm, Rowatt-Ahearn Ltd. and became president of the Ottawa Electric Railway Company in 1938 after his father died. Ahearn also had interests in several other Ottawa businesses including Wallace Realty Company, the Ottawa Car Manufacturing Company, the Ottawa Gas Company, the Ottawa Investment Company, Ahearn & Soper and other businesses.He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962 as a builder. He was inducted into the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame in 1966.\nAhearn died in 1962 at his home at 7 Rideau Gate, Ottawa, and was interred in Beechwood Cemetery. He was survived by his wife Norah, son Thomas Trevor, and daughters Joan and Lilias."

In 1824, he arrived in Kazan and took his chair. Simultaneously, he worked on terrestrial magnetism, and magnetic charge of the geological expeditions in the vicinity of Mount Elbrus.\nSince 1828, he was a member of the Academy of Sciences of Mineralogy, and from 1840 in physics.\nIn 1828, he traveled to the South and Middle Urals. He visited Zlatoust, Miass, and Chelyabinsk. After seeing the Ural Mountains in the vicinity of Zlatoust, he identified three mountain ranges: Urenga, Taganay, and Yurmu. In 1833, he published a book in French, compiled from the diaries he kept during the Urals travel, Journey to the Urals, undertaken in 1828. In 1834, a copy of this book was presented to Emperor Nicholas I.\nIn 1829, Kupfer traveled to the Caucasus, and was later appointed director of the Mineralogical Museum, and founded the St. Petersburg Observatory, which focused on meteorological observations throughout the empire.\nKupfer offered a plan to introduce a unified system of measures throughout Russia; he was chief executive of the Commission on Weights and Measures from 1832 to 1842. He led the development of Russian system of measures, and creation of the first standard units of mass and length, the platinum pounds and yards, as well as exemplary volume measures \u2013 buckets and the quadrangle. The results of his works were legitimized in the imperial decree in 1835, and they are described in the Travaux de la Commission pour fixer les mesures et les poids etc. (St. Petersburg, 1841).\nIn 1843 he was elected ordinary academician.\nIn 1859, he represented Russia at the Congress of the International Association for the introduction of a uniform system of measures, weights and coins in Bradford.\n\nBeginning in 1857, Russia and France began to exchange meteorological data. Kupfer went to the negotiations abroad, and in winter 1865, he arranged to create a telegraphic communication between all European countries. Being essentially the creator of combined weather service, Kupfer did not have time to enjoy the fruits of his labors. During cold weather in March, while he was installing on the roof of the observatory an anemograph (self-recording anemometer) that he brought from Paris, he caught cold and died of pneumonia two months later on 4 June 1865. He was buried in Smolensky Lutheran Cemetery in St. Petersburg. Kupffer also pioneered in the setting up magnetometric observatory which took hourly observations of the magnetic field of the Earth."

        "content": "Gregory was born around AD 213 to a wealthy pagan family in Neocaesarea (modern Niksar, then the capital of the area of Pontus in Asia Minor). Little is known of his pastoral work, and his surviving theological writings are in an incomplete state. This lack of knowledge partially obscures his personality, despite his historical importance, and his immemorial title Thaumaturgus, \"the wonder-worker\" in Latinized Greek, casts an air of legend about him. Nevertheless, the lives of few bishops of the third century are so well authenticated; the historical references to him permit a fairly detailed reconstruction of his work.Originally he was known as Theodore (\"gift of God\"), not an exclusively Christian name. He was introduced to the Christian religion at the age of fourteen, after the death of his father. He had a brother Athenodorus, and on the advice of one of their tutors, the young men were eager to study at the Berytus in Beirut, then one of the four or five famous schools in the Hellenic world. At this time, their brother-in-law was appointed assessor (legal counsel) to the Roman Governor of Palestine; the youths had therefore an occasion to act as an escort to their sister as far as Caesarea in Palestine. On arrival in that town they learned that the celebrated scholar Origen, head of the Catechetical School of Alexandria, resided there. Curiosity led them to hear and converse with the master. Soon both youths forgot all about Beirut and Roman law, and gave themselves up to the great Christian teacher, who gradually won them over to Christianity.\nIn his panegyric on Origen, Gregory describes the method employed by that master to win the confidence and esteem of those he wished to convert; how he mingled a persuasive candour with outbursts of temper and theological argument put cleverly at once and unexpectedly. Persuasive skill rather than bare reasoning, and evident sincerity and an ardent conviction were the means Origen used to make converts. Gregory took up at first the study of philosophy; theology was afterwards added, but his mind remained always inclined to philosophical study, so much so indeed that in his youth he cherished strongly the hope of demonstrating that the Christian religion was the only true and good philosophy. For seven years he underwent the mental and moral discipline of Origen (231 to 238 or 239). There is no reason to believe that his studies were interrupted by the persecutions of Maximinus of Thrace; his alleged journey to Alexandria, at this time, may therefore be considered at least doubtful, and probably never occurred.\nBefore leaving Palestine, Gregory delivered in presence of Origen a public farewell oration in which he returned thanks to the illustrious master he was leaving. This oration is valuable from many points of view. As a rhetorical exercise it exhibits the excellent training given by Origen, and his skill in developing literary taste and the amount of adulation then permissible towards a living person in an assembly composed mostly of Christians, and Christian in temper. It contains, moreover, much useful information concerning the youth of Gregory and his master's method of teaching. A letter of Origen refers to the departure of the two brothers, but it is not easy to determine whether it was written before or after the delivery of this oration. In it Origen exhorts his pupils to bring the intellectual treasures of the Greeks to the service of Christian philosophy, and thus imitate the Jews who employed the golden vessels of the Egyptians to adorn the Holy of Holies.\nGregory returned to Pontus with the intention of practising law. His plan, however, was again laid aside, for he was soon consecrated bishop of his native Neocaesarea by Phoedimus, Bishop of Amasea and metropolitan of Pontus. This fact illustrates in an interesting way the growth of the hierarchy in the primitive Church; the Christian community at Caesarea was very small, being only seventeen souls, and yet it was given a bishop. Ancient canonical documents indicate that it was possible for a community of even ten Christians to have their own bishop. When Gregory was consecrated he was forty years old, and he ruled his diocese for thirteen years.\nNothing definite is known about his methods, but he must have shown much zeal in increasing the little flock with which he began his episcopal administration. An ancient source attests to his missionary zeal by recording a curious coincidence: Gregory began with only seventeen Christians, but at his death there remained only seventeen pagans in the whole town of Caesarea. Presumably the many miracles which won for him the title of Thaumaturgus were performed during these years."

        "content": "Sources on the life, teaching, and actions of Gregory Thaumaturgus are all more or less open to criticism. Besides the details given by Gregory himself, there are four other sources of information, according to K\u00f6tschau all derived from oral tradition; indeed, the differences between them force the conclusion that they cannot all be derived from one common written source. They are: \n\nLife and Panegyric of Gregory by St. Gregory of Nyssa (P.G., XLVI, col. 893 sqq.);\nHistoria Miraculorum, by Rufinus;\nan account in Syriac of the great actions of Blessed Gregory (sixth-century manuscript);\nSt. Basil, De Spiritu Sancto.Drawing on family traditions and a knowledge of the neighbourhood, the account by Gregory of Nyssa is more reliably historical than other known versions of the Thaumaturge's life. By the time of Rufinus (ca. 400), the original story was becoming confused; the Syriac account is at times obscure and contradictory. Even the life by Gregory of Nyssa exhibits a legendary element, though the facts were supplied to the writer by his grandmother, St. Macrina the Elder. He relates that before his episcopal consecration Gregory retired from Neocaesarea into a solitude, and was favoured by an apparition of the Blessed Virgin and John the Apostle, and that the latter dictated to him a creed or formula of Christian faith, of which the autograph existed at Neocaesarea when the biography was being written. The creed itself is important for the history of Christian doctrine.Gregory of Nyssa describes at length the miracles that gained for the Bishop of Caesarea the title of Thaumaturgus. It is clear that Gregory's influence must have been considerable, and his miraculous power undoubted. It might have been expected that Gregory's name would appear among those who took part in the First Council of Antioch against Paul of Samosata; probably he took part also in the second council held there against the same heresiarch, for the letter of that council is signed by a bishop named Theodore, which had been originally Gregory's name. To attract the people to the festivals in honour of the martyrs, Gregory organized profane amusements that might appeal to pagans, who were accustomed to religious ceremonies that combined solemnity with pleasure and merrymaking."

He tried high jump for the first time when challenged by members of the track and field team, who were reacting to his claims about his ability to slam dunk. Thomas cleared 6'6\" (1.98 m) on his first attempt and 7' (2.13 m) on his third-ever jump. The athletes then sought the head track coach Lane Lohr, who entered Thomas in a meet two days later at Eastern Illinois University. At the meet, he cleared 7'3.25\" (2.22 m) on his seventh-ever jump.In March 2006, Thomas placed second at the 2006 NAIA Indoor Track & Field National Championships with a height of 7'1.75\" (2.18 m). Later that month, just two months after taking up high jump, he finished fourth at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne with a jump of 2.23 m. Not yet experienced at high jump, Thomas gained notoriety at the Commonwealth Games for not measuring his run-up, competing in shoes without spikes, and putting his arms behind his back to land on the mat as if breaking his fall.During the 2007 indoor season, he cleared 2.30 metres for the first time and in March jumped 2.33 metres in Fayetteville, Arkansas. In July 2007 he cleared 2.35 metres in Salamanca, Spain. The result was a new personal best and the world season's best at the time. He then won the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan, again with a 2.35 jump. He also won gold at the 2007 IAAF World Athletics Final. That year, he also won the IAAF Newcomer of the Year and the Bahamas Amateur Athletic Association Athlete of the Year.The Olympics in 2008, however, turned out to be a major disappointment for Thomas. He made only 2.20 in the qualifying round and finished 21st overall.Thomas won the gold medal in the high jump at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India. In the final, he was the only competitor to clear the height of 2.32, which he managed on the first attempt. His countryman Trevor Barry won the silver medal in the event. In 2011, he won the gold medal in the high jump at the Pan American Games in Guadalajara, Mexico, again with a height of 2.32.\nThomas competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom. In qualification, he cleared 2.16, passed on 2.21, failed to clear 2.26, and did not advance to the final.\nThomas represented the Bahamas at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He made the final for the first time at an Olympic competition and finished in equal 7th place with a jump of 2.29.He competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics."

In boxing, he competed between 1967 and 1997 and was nicknamed \"Big George\". He is a two-time world heavyweight champion and an Olympic gold medalist. As an entrepreneur, he is known for the George Foreman Grill.\nAfter a troubled childhood, Foreman took up amateur boxing and won a gold medal in the heavyweight division at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Having turned professional the next year, he won the world heavyweight title with a stunning second-round knockout of then-undefeated Joe Frazier in 1973. He defended the belt twice before suffering his first professional loss to Muhammad Ali in the iconic Rumble in the Jungle in 1974. Unable to secure another title opportunity, Foreman retired after a loss to Jimmy Young in 1977.\nFollowing what he referred to as a religious epiphany, Foreman became an ordained Christian minister. Ten years later he announced a comeback, and in 1994 at age 45 won the unified WBA, IBF, and lineal heavyweight championship titles by knocking out 26-year-old Michael Moorer. He dropped the WBA belt rather than face his mandatory title defense soon after, and following a single successful title defense against Axel Schulz, Foreman relinquished his IBF title as well on June 28, 1995. At 46 years and 169 days old, he was the oldest world heavyweight champion in history. Foreman is the oldest to ever win the world heavyweight boxing championship of major honors and the second-oldest in any weight class after Bernard Hopkins (at light heavyweight). He retired in 1997 at the age of 48, with a final record of 76 wins (68 knockouts) and 5 losses.\nForeman has been inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame and International Boxing Hall of Fame. The International Boxing Research Organization rates Foreman as the eighth-greatest heavyweight of all time. In 2002, he was named one of the 25 greatest fighters of the past 80 years by The Ring. The Ring ranked him as the ninth-greatest puncher of all time. He was a ringside analyst for HBO's boxing coverage for 12 years until 2004. Outside boxing, he is a successful entrepreneur and known for his promotion of the George Foreman Grill, which has sold more than 100 million units worldwide. In 1999, he sold the commercial rights to the grill for $138 million."

He also founded the Lyon Equipment Company and Dob's, Inc.Coggins frequently attended to his business, and he had little spare time to interact with friends and family or engage in leisurely activities. Over the course of his career he became a millionaire. His newfound wealth allowed him to purchase a large home and 16-acres of land in western Raleigh. He founded Raleigh Memorial Park, a cemetery. His last development project was the erection of a large mausoleum in the cemetery. Coggins had wanted to build such a structure since the 1950s but never had any commercial support to do so, and decided to personally construct it in the early 1990s. He dedicated it to his wife.Coggins served as chairman of the board of Textile Research Services, Inc.. He was also a member of the National Association of Cemeteries, North Carolina Cemetery Association, Raleigh Merchants Bureau, Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, North Carolina Association of Quality Restaurants, North Carolina Motel Association, Association of General Contractors, Raleigh Board of Realtors, and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen."

He was named to the Pro Bowl in three straight seasons from 1960 to 1962, owing to his status as a shut-down corner, which resulted in four interceptions in 1961 and two in 1962.  Hill was cited by numerous players and coaches as an efficient corner, with Del Shofner calling him \"inhuman\" and his backfield coach Ray Willsey calling him one of the best of the league, and Hill did not allow a touchdown pass from 1960 to 1962.\nHill's career highlights were overshadowed by his performance in a game on October 20, 1963, against the Green Bay Packers. When making a tackle on quarterback Bart Starr on the sideline, Starr kicked Hill in the mouth only for Hill to follow with a punch to the face of Starr. He was assessed a 15-yard penalty and ejection; Hill lost two teeth on the kick while Starr broke a bone in his throwing hand and missed four games while neither was suspended. Hill apologized to Starr after the game, which Starr forgave, but Sports Illustrated covered the story a few weeks later and portrayed the moment as a negative one for Hill, with journalist Walter Bingham calling it \"the most reprehensible play of the season\" (either by ignoring or not knowing of Hill's apology). Hill was booed by the St. Louis crowd after the story broke out, and he was quoted as saying that it hurt him deeply to the point where he did not want to be introduced with the other starters before games. He retired briefly after the 1964 season but returned to do stints with the Lions and Chiefs in 1965 and 1966, with the latter tenure of three games earning him a championship (although he did not play in the postseason run for the Chiefs). Years later, Hill was cited by The Arizona Republic as the 98th best player in Cardinals history."

He was one of the first to state and rigorously prove theorems of calculus, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra of earlier authors. He is one of the founders of complex analysis and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra.\nA profound mathematician, Cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors; Hans Freudenthal stated:\n\n\"More concepts and theorems have been named for Cauchy than for any other mathematician (in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy).\"Cauchy was a prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks on a variety of topics in the fields of mathematics and mathematical physics."

Their life there during that time was apparently hard; Augustin-Louis's father, Louis Fran\u00e7ois, spoke of living on rice, bread, and crackers during the period. A paragraph from an undated letter from Louis Fran\u00e7ois to his mother in Rouen says:\nWe never had more than a one-half pound (230 g) of bread \u2014 and sometimes not even that. This we supplement with little supply of hard crackers and rice that we are allotted. Otherwise, we are getting along quite well, which is the important thing and goes to show that human beings can get by with little. I should tell you that for my children's pap I still have a bit of fine flour, made from wheat that I grew on my own land. I had three bushels, and I also have a few pounds of potato starch. It is as white as snow and very good, too, especially for very young children. It, too, was grown on my own land.  In any event, he inherited his father's staunch royalism and hence refused to take oaths to any government after the overthrow of Charles X.\nHe was an equally staunch Catholic and a member of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. He also had links to the Society of Jesus and defended them at the Academy when it was politically unwise to do so. His zeal for his faith may have led to his caring for Charles Hermite during his illness and leading Hermite to become a faithful Catholic. It also inspired Cauchy to plead on behalf of the Irish during the Great Famine of Ireland.\nHis royalism and religious zeal made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues. He felt that he was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed. Niels Henrik Abel called him a \"bigoted Catholic\" and added he was \"mad and there is nothing that can be done about him\", but at the same time praised him as a mathematician. Cauchy's views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause. When Libri was accused of stealing books he was replaced by Joseph Liouville rather than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy. Another dispute with political overtones concerned Jean-Marie Constant Duhamel and a claim on inelastic shocks. Cauchy was later shown, by Jean-Victor Poncelet, to be wrong."

It was at this time in 1869 that Vest was asked to represent Charles Burden and Old Drum in the case that would make him famous, Burden v. Hornsby.\nVest took the case tried on September 23, 1870, in which he represented a client whose hunting dog, a foxhound named Drum (or Old Drum), had been killed by a sheep farmer, Leonidas Hornsby. The farmer (Burden's brother-in-law) had previously announced his intentions to kill any dog found on his property; the dog's owner was suing for damages in the amount of\n$150 (equivalent to $3,614 in 2023), the maximum allowed by law.\nDuring the trial, Vest stated that he would \"win the case or apologize to every dog in Missouri.\" \nVest's closing argument to the jury made no reference to any of the testimony offered during the trial, and instead offered a eulogy of sorts. Vest's \"Eulogy of the Dog\" is one of the most enduring passages of purple prose in American courtroom history (only a partial transcript has survived):\n\nGentlemen of the jury: The best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it the most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog.\nGentlemen of the jury: A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.\n\nIf fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death.\nVest won the case (the jury awarded $50 to the dog's owner) and also won its appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court. A bust of the dog resides in the Missouri Supreme Court building in Jefferson City, Missouri. In 1958, a statue of the dog was erected on the Johnson County Courthouse lawn containing a summation of Vest's closing speech, \u201cA man\u2019s best friend is his dog.\u201d"

At the semi-final stage against eventual champions Denmark, after setting up Bergkamp's opening goal, Rijkaard scored a late equalizer for the Netherlands in a 2\u20132 draw, but the Dutch went out on penalties, despite Rijkaard successfully netting his spot-kick.

Due to his aggression and versatility, he was also capable of playing as a central or box-to-box midfielder, and even in a defensive role, usually in the centre. Although Rijkaard was known as a strong tackler, he was surprisingly elegant for a player of his size, and also possessed good technique, passing ability, link-up play, and vision, which made him adept at starting attacking plays as a deep-lying playmaker once he won back possession. He was also capable of playing in more advanced roles as an attacking midfielder or second striker. Due to his height and physical strength, he excelled in the air; possessed a powerful shot; and was capable of getting forward and contributing to his team's attacking plays by making late runs into the penalty area. Rijkaard was described by British broadsheet The Daily Telegraph as having been \"a stylish player of faultless pedigree\". In 2004, Rijkaard was named in the FIFA 100, Pel\u00e9's list of the 125 World's Greatest Living Footballers."

        "content": "As a coach, Rijkaard's essential philosophy is to guide his team towards playing attack-minded football as a cohesive unit. In doing this, he believes a team can achieve the dual objectives of winning games and ensuring the audience's enjoyment of the spectacle. This follows in the best coaching traditions of Rijkaard's countrymen and forebears Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff. In this light, it is notable that Michels coached both Cruyff and Rijkaard during their respective participations with the Dutch national team, and that Cruyff himself went on to coach Rijkaard. Nonetheless, Rijkaard believes in working within a contemporary football context and is not out to imitate the styles and tactics of past masters. In his own words: you gain many impressions from the past. You still have it in your mind when you become a coach, and if something happens you can recall how it was dealt with. But I strongly believe that you cannot copy anyone. The decisions that a great coach made years ago will not necessarily work today.\nRijkaard has evidently learned to curb the quick temper of his playing days and is often a portrait of calm and stability in training and along the touchline. He rarely courts controversy in the media and is more apt now to promote a positive environment and let his team's play speak for itself when faced with intense rivalry or criticism. The tactics used during his tenure as manager of Barcelona best exemplify Rijkaard's commitment to playing stylish attacking football. During the team's 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 campaigns, the coach frequently fielded a 4\u20133\u20133 formation, a system which encouraged the flair and creativity of the players in the front third of the field and created optimal interplay between the midfielders and forwards during attacks, with Ronaldinho being the focal point of the team's offence. Within this system, the four defenders also tended to play in a relatively high position on the pitch to support the midfield, which frequently advanced to participate in the attack. The team generally focuses on maintaining possession in the opponents' half of the field, applying pressure in order to force the opposition to make errors in defense and offensive counter-attacking."

His style is described ample and accurate, paying attention to tones and sounds, to contrasts and to orchestral material full of expression.\nShams has said about Persian music: \"To me, music has to bring love, harmony, pleasure, happiness, but also rhythm and movement.

He earned a MS in Environmental Biology from Eastern Illinois University and the PhD degree in Environmental Science from Arkansas State University, specializing in ecotoxicology and conservation ecology.  He is notable alumni from all three universities. He has been ranked among the 150 most influential environmental scientists.In 1997 his discovery of deformed frogs in Madison County, Illinois received media coverage in St. Louis news outlets. He then worked at the St. Louis Children's Aquarium as the institution's grant writer, and designed educational programs, conducted research on the use of bovine somatotropin (bST) applications in aquaculture, and delivered tours and extension programming until he left to pursue his PhD in 1999. He also organized and edited the First International Symposium on the conservation and sustainability of the ornamental fish industry on Rio Negro River, Manaus.  He participated in several areas of research that later were published by the aquarium from 1999-2001. Stanley E. Trauth was his doctoral mentor.\nMany of his early papers were focused on natural history, but they also cover amphibian conservation, ecological immunology, and general biology.  He is widely published on the life history and conservation of Blanchard's cricket frog (Acris blanchardi ) with papers on its systematics, immunology, behavior, life history, and conservation needs.  He continued this research as an assistant professor at Louisiana State University at Shreveport from 2003\u20132005. \n\nIn 2006 McCallum and several other scientists established the journal Herpetological Conservation and Biology.\n\nHe moved to Texas A&M University Texarkana in 2005. Here, he developed a novel teaching method for classroom discussions. \"The result of this model was not only to circumvent many lazy student behaviors, but also to improve reading comprehension by familiarizing students with how to read, process, and evaluate complex scientific manuscripts in a short period of time.\" Hedwig P\u00f6ll\u00f6l\u00e4inen.\nMcCallum used fuzzy logic in his paper, Amphibian decline or extinction? Current losses dwarf background extinction rates, to compare recent extinction rates of amphibians to their rates at the k-Pg boundary. His calculations demonstrated that the losses in amphibian biodiversity in recent times represented one of the most rapid losses in biodiversity ever observed. In 2008 the study was listed by Discover Magazine as #4 among ten \"landmark papers\" on the topic of amphibian extinctions and declines. His use of fuzzy approaches was extended to two studies addressing climate change impacts on herpetofauna. His 2015 paper argued that species losses of vertebrate animals since 1980 have been faster that the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event that wiped out dinosaurs 65 million years ago, suggesting we are in a 6th mass extinction.In 2014 he conducted a study using Google Trends to data mine Google search data to infer public interest on the environment, and concluded that interest in the environment had fallen since 2004. In 2019, he compared Google searches before and after release of the landmark encyclical, Laudato Si', revealing that interest in the environment rose markedly in most countries around the world."

After that they travelled to Venice, where they stayed two years, attending the funeral of their friend Karel Dujardin. They finally left Italy in 1679 and went north to Hamburg, where they lived until 1684 when Jan Gotlieb went into the service of a German prince. From there he traveled to Vienna and from there to Wroclaw, where he died in 1703.According to the RKD Jan Gotlieb Glauber was born in Utrecht as the younger brother of the painter Diana Glauber, accompanied his brother on all his travels, but left Hamburg in 1685 for Vienna."

A prolific author of texts in his field, his two-volume treatise, The Dynamics and Thermodynamics of Compressible Fluid Flow, published in 1953 and 1954, is considered a classic. His 1961 book Shape and Flow: The Fluid Dynamics of Drag explained boundary layer phenomena and drag in simple, non-mathematical terms. He also founded the National Council for Fluid Mechanics Films (NCFMF), in cooperation with the Educational Development Center. From there, Shapiro was appointed Chair of the Institute's Faculty in 1964-1965 and head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering from 1965 to 1974.In 1962 he demonstrated the Coriolis effect in a bathtub-sized water tank placed in MIT (latitude 42\u00b0 N). The experiment required extreme precision, since the acceleration due to Coriolis effect is only 3\u00d710\u22127{\\displaystyle 3\\times 10^{-7}} that of gravity. The tank was filled, kept static for 24 hours, then drained. The vortex was measured by a cross made of two silvers of wood pinned above the draining hole. It takes 20 minutes to drain, and the cross starts turning only around 15 minutes. At the end it is turning at 1 rotation every 3 to 4 seconds.Shapiro was elected to American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1952, the National Academy of Sciences in 1967, and National Academy of Engineering in 1974. He was awarded the Benjamin Garver Lamme Award by the American Society of Engineering Education in 1977. He was awarded the Fluids Engineering Award in 1977 and the Drucker Medal in 1999 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He was awarded honorary Doctor of Science in 1978 by the University of Salford and in 1985 by the Technion."

After the end of the season, he signed for Everton in a \u00a31 million deal, but the move was not a success and after just one season at Goodison Park, Joe Royle bought him back to Oldham, who had just returned to the top flight after a 68-year exile.\nMilligan resumed his key role in the Oldham side that survived three seasons in the top flight (Premier League from 1992), helping them reach another FA Cup semi final in 1994, before leaving to join Norwich City after Oldham's relegation from the Premier League. He remained at Carrow Road until 2000, when he signed for Blackpool. At Bloomfield Road, he helped Steve McMahon's side win the Division Three playoffs and survive in Division Two before finally retiring in the summer of 2002, aged 35, after a career spanning 19 years.\nBorn in England, he played once for the Republic of Ireland in 1992, once for the Republic of Ireland U21 and twice for the Republic of Ireland B."

        "content": "After beginning his playing career in Oldham Athletic's youth team on leaving school in 1983, he turned professional in the 1984\u201385 season and made his debut the season after, before becoming a first team regular by the time of his 20th birthday in February 1987. He helped the Latics reach the Football League Cup final in 1989\u201390, where they lost 1\u20130 to Nottingham Forest, as well as reaching the FA Cup semi finals where they held Manchester United to a 3\u20133 draw before losing the replay 2\u20131.\nHowever, the Latics were still in the Second Division in 1990 despite having looked like promotion contenders more than once since Milligan's debut five years earlier. When Everton manager Colin Harvey made a \u00a31million bid for him, he accepted the offer and headed to Goodison Park on 24 August 1990. Unfortunately, his time at Everton was not a success as the Toffees endured a terrible start to the season and Harvey was replaced by Howard Kendall as manager in early November 1990. Everton's form improved and they climbed from 18th in early November to ninth in the final table, as well as reaching the FA Cup quarter-finals and eliminating neighbours Liverpool on the way, but Milligan failed to perform well on the pitch and made 17 appearances, scoring once, during a frustrating league campaign.\nMeanwhile, Joe Royle had guided Oldham to the Second Division title and ended their 68-year absence from the First Division in 1990\u201391, and he secured Milligan's return to Boundary Park on 17 July 1991 for a club record fee of \u00a3600,000.\nMilligan carried on where he had left off on his return to Oldham, being a key part of their midfield as they survived three seasons in the top flight and reached an FA Cup semi-final in the 1993\u201394 season, only being denied a Wembley final appearance when a Mark Hughes equaliser for Manchester United held them to a 1\u20131 draw in the first game before they were finally crushed 4\u20131 in the Maine Road replay.\nOldham went down from the Premier League at the end of the 1993\u201394 season and Milligan was determined to remain at the top level. His wish was granted on 27 June 1994 when he signed for Norwich City in an \u00a3800,000 deal.[1]\nMilligan had a fine start to his career at Carrow Road, as Norwich entered the Christmas period just outside the top five and with ambitions of a UEFA Cup place. But they suddenly went into freefall, won only one of their final 20 league games, and plummeted to 20th place and relegation. Manager John Deehan resigned a month before relegation was confirmed, replaced on a caretaker basis by Gary Megson until the job went to Martin O'Neill after the season's end. O'Neill left in December 1995 to take over at Leicester City, with Gary Megson returning for a second brief spell at the helm as the Canaries finished 16th after some early promise.\nMike Walker was Norwich's manager from the start of the 1996\u201397 season, and like the previous managers selected Milligan as a regular in central midfield. However, Walker had gone within two years and new manager Bruce Rioch gave Milligan fewer first team chances, as he appeared just twice in the 1998\u201399 season and 11 times in 1999\u20132000. He finally left Norwich in May 2000 after six years with the club, and signed for Blackpool on a free transfer after their relegation to the Third Division.[2]\nIn Milligan's first season at Bloomfield Road, he helped them secure qualification for the Division Three playoffs and they won the final to secure an immediate return to Division Two. After contributing to their survival in the 2001\u201302 season, he retired from playing to call time on a career which had spanned nearly 20 years. At Blackpool he scored once, in a 6\u20130 win over Scunthorpe United."

        "content": "Alberto Henschel (13 June 1827 \u2013 30 June 1882) was a German-born Brazilian photographer born in Berlin. Considered the hardest-working photographer and businessman in 19th-century Brazil, with offices in Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo, Henschel was also responsible for the presence of other professional photographers in the country, including his compatriot Karl Ernst Papf\u2014with whom he later worked.Henschel became known for making pictorial representations of Rio de Janeiro as a landscape photographer and for being an excellent portraitist. He earned the title of Photographo da Casa Imperial (Photographer of the Royal House), allowing him to photograph the everyday life of the Brazilian monarchy during the Reign of Pedro II, even photographing the emperor Dom Pedro II and his family. This title would give his photographs increased recognition and raise their price.But his principal contribution to the history of Brazilian photography is his photographic record of  the different social classes in Brazil in the 19th century: portraits, usually in the carte de visite format, taken of the nobility, of rich tradesmen, of the middle-class, and of black people, either slaves or free, in a period  before the Lei \u00c1urea."

Among the first  attractions were the enthusiastic descriptions and illustrations of the Indians, the exotic landscapes, the abundance of wild animals and the new species of plants first conveyed in the works of Hans Staden. This was followed by the writings of adventurers and scientists such as Johann Baptist Emanuel Pohl, author of Viagem no Interior do Brasil, Empreendida nos Anos de 1817 a 1821 e Publicada por Ordem de Sua Majestade o Imperador da \u00c1ustria Francisco Primeiro (Voyage in the Interior of Brazil. Launched in the Years of 1817 to 1821 and Published by the Order of His Majesty the Emperor of Austria Franscisco First), in which he describes his journey through the country with wonder and enthusiasm, his words accompanied by luxuriant illustrations. About Rio de Janeiro, Pohl wrote:\n\nIf some place in the New World deserves, for its location and natural conditions, to become one day a theater of big events, a center of civilization and culture, an emporium of worldwide commerce, it is, in my opinion, Rio de Janeiro. I cannot, here, repress this observation. Willingly hovers the fantasy on the future of such charming country, that is at present little developed and, so to speak, does not have a past.\u2014Johann Emmanuel Pohl\nCertainly these narrations and illustrations were  the principal attractions for those German photographers of the 19th century that moved to Brazil, such as Revert Henrique Klumb, Augusto Stahl, Karl Ernst Papf, and Alberto Henschel."

In his announcement in the Novo Almanach de S\u00e3o Paulo para o Anno de 1883 (New Almanac of S\u00e3o Paulo for the Year of 1883), Henschel advertised:\n\nThis establishment just received from Europe the negatives for the new process of instantaneous photographies that have so much success there. Through these chichets one can obtain a more perfect portrait of a moving child, of nervous people... The public is invited to come examine in the establishment some portraits obtained by the new process.\nThe new process referred to in the announcement was the use of dry slabs of transparent gelatin, used as an adhesive layer for the fixation of the silver salts over the paper.He photographed all the different social classes of Brazil in the 19th century. Besides the Brazilian monarchy and black people, he also photographed the nobility, the rich tradesmen and their families, and the white middle-class."

She frequented the Village bars, especially those, like the San Remo and the Cedar Tavern, favored by artists and writers, and she dressed in fantastic, gypsylike outfits.

It seemed abruptly too punishing to live at the pace we had been going for several years.\" In the fall of 1956 they moved to a rented \"sprawling white saltbox farmhouse\" in Bridgewater, Connecticut, near a literary and artistic community that included Arthur Miller and William Styron in nearby Roxbury.In 1957, she gave birth to her first daughter, Danielle.

In the summer of 1960, in Provincetown, Massachusetts, Adele danced in a production called \"The Pirates of Provincetown,\" and James Baldwin praised her performance, \"though she had no lines beyond one scream, which she delivered with gusto in high 'method' style\"; later that summer she had to bail Norman out of jail after a drunken run-in with the police."

Since then he was in and out of jail, until, on 6 December 1995, the so-called Spartacus investigation identified him as one of the heads of the Casalesi clan.

He insists on being treated like a priest: 'You should do what I say and not what I do.' He knows how to construct his image. Employees are allegedly received in extravagant villas and greeted with a tiger on a leash. Together with his brother Pasquale he has become the \"king of tendering\" in construction, getting public contracts for the high-speed train Tav, a new prison, the local rail line and a NATO radar base.With Antonio Iovine, Zagaria represented the new face of management of the Camorra, forging strategic alliances with the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta.

        "content": "Ellen Buckingham Mathews (1849\u20131920) was a popular female English novelist during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She was also known as Mrs Reeves after her marriage in 1877 to Dr. Henry Albert Reeves (1841\u20131914) but was best known under her pen name, Helen Mathers. She was born in Misterton, Somerset. Her first novel, \"Comin' thro' the Rye\" was published in 1875. It was partly based on people in her life and on her own early romantic experiences. She also acknowledged Rhoda Broughton as an early influence. She continued to write until her death.\nShe was educated at a boarding school in  Chantry near Frome in Somerset. In her first novel, \"Comin' thro' the Rye\" she describes some of her experiences at school. \"Mr Russell\" in the novel was the Rev. Mr. Fussell in real life, who was the Lord of the manor and founder of the school. In the novel she calls the village Charteris. From 1875 to 1895 the novel sold over 35,000 copies.Due to a confusion of titles, some sources attribute a number of books by Scottish novelist Anne S. Swan to Mathers. Mathers published a short novel entitled \"Land o' the Leal, by the Author of Comin' Thro' the Rye\" in 1878. Swan published \"The Land o' the Leal\" using her male pseudonym David Lyall, in 1896. Conflating the two different novels with the same title has led some people to assume (erroneously) that David Lyall is Mathers's pseudonym. It is not."

He finished his rugby career at Bath Rugby where a debilitating toe injury limited his appearances and finally ended his playing career.\nGeoghegan is perhaps best known for his try in the 1994 Five Nations match against England at Twickenham, that was instrumental in a famous 13\u201312 win. Another key contribution during the match was a  kick, chase and tackle on England fly-half Rob Andrew which led to a crucial kickable penalty to Ireland. An adept side stepper, he was once described by the commentator Bill McLaren as being \"Like a mad trout up a burn\".Geoghegan was controversially left out of the 1993 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand when England's Ian Hunter and Tony Underwood were taken ahead of him.  Former New Zealand hooker and Geoghegan's then London Irish coach Hika Reid was quoted at the time as being surprised as he felt the conditions would have suited him.  In 1997 the Lions management apparently held a place open for him until the last possible minute, even though he had played little rugby that year due to the toe problems that cut short his career.As an amateur player Geoghegan had a career outside rugby as a solicitor.  He is currently a real estate and finance partner in London at  Rosling King LLP\nGeoghegan qualified for Ireland through his Galway born father. His grandfather played in the 1929 All-Ireland Hurling Final."

He first played for Kent's Second XI in 1901 and made his first-class cricket debut for the county in May 1902 against MCC at Lord's. He played in two matches in 1902, taking five wickets.Fairservice is often credited with taking the wicket of W.G. Grace as his first wicket in first-class cricket. Fairservice did bowl Grace twice in the same match in May 1903, again against MCC at Lord's, but his first wickets were taken in the same fixture the previous year in which Grace did not play.Fairservice played fairly regularly from 1903 until the start of World War I during a period in which Kent won four County Championship titles. He took at least 35 wickets in every season other than 1912, although his opportunities were limited as Kent had spin bowlers Colin Blythe and Frank Woolley as regulars in the team at this time. He was awarded his county cap in 1903.With Blythe killed in the war, Fairservice had increased opportunities in 1919 and 1920. In the latter, a cool summer with many wet pitches, Fairservice had his most productive season, taking 113 wickets at an average of 17.46, although Wisden admitted that batsmen still did not find him difficult when pitches were firm. A highlight of that season was when he and Woolley bowled out Surrey for 61 and 73 on a slow, sticky wicket at Blackheath. In the exceptionally hot and dry summer of 1921, however, Fairservice was less effective, taking only 50 wickets at an average of 32.50, and announced his retirement at the close of 1921 after being awarded a benefit match against Surrey, although he played for Northumberland between 1924 and 1926."

He was the spiritual successor of the 23rd Tirthankara Parshvanatha. Mahavira was born in the early 6th century BCE into a royal Jain family of ancient India. His mother's name was Trishala and his father's name was Siddhartha. They were lay devotees of Parshvanatha. Mahavira abandoned all worldly possessions at the age of about 30 and left home in pursuit of spiritual awakening, becoming an ascetic. Mahavira practiced intense meditation and severe austerities for twelve and a half years, after which he attained Kevala Jnana (omniscience). He preached for 30 years and attained moksha (liberation) in the 6th century BCE, although the year varies by sect.\nMahavira taught that observance of the vows of ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) are necessary for spiritual liberation. He taught the principles of Anekantavada (many-sided reality): syadvada and nayavada. Mahavira's teachings were compiled by Indrabhuti Gautama (his chief disciple) as the Jain Agamas. The texts, transmitted orally by Jain monks, are believed to have been largely lost by about the 1st century CE. \nMahavira is usually depicted in a sitting or standing meditative posture, with the symbol of a lion beneath him. His earliest iconography is from archaeological sites in the North Indian city of Mathura, and is dated from between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE. His birth is celebrated as Mahavir Janma Kalyanak and his nirvana (salvation) and also his first shishya of Gautama Swami is observed by Jains as Diwali.\nHistorically, Mahavira, who revived and preached Jainism in ancient India, was an older contemporary of Gautama Buddha. Jains celebrate Mahavir Janma Kalyanak every year on the 13th day of the Indian Calendar month of Chaitra."

        "content": "Surviving early Jain and Buddhist literature uses several names (or epithets) for Mahavira, including Nayaputta, Muni, Samana, Nigantha, Brahman, and Bhagavan. In early Buddhist sutras, he is referred to as Araha (\"worthy\") and Veyavi (derived from \"Vedas\", but meaning \"wise\"). He is known as Sramana in the Kalpa S\u016btra, \"devoid of love and hate\".According to later Jain texts, Mahavira's childhood name was Vardham\u0101na (\"the one who grows\") because of the kingdom's prosperity at the time of his birth. According to the Kalpasutras, he was called Mahavira (\"the great hero\") by the gods in the Kalpa S\u016btra because he remained steadfast in the midst of dangers, fears, hardships and calamities. He is also known as a tirthankara."

        "content": "It is universally accepted by scholars of Jainism that Mahavira lived in ancient India. According to the Digambara Uttarapurana text, Mahavira was born in Kundalpur in the Kingdom of the Videhas; the \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara Kalpa S\u016btra uses the name \"Kundagrama\", said to be located in present-day Bihar, India. Although it is thought to be the town of Basu Kund, about 60 kilometres (37 miles) north of Patna (the capital of Bihar), his birthplace remains a subject of dispute. Mahavira renounced his material wealth and left home when he was twenty-eight, by some accounts (thirty by others), lived an ascetic life for twelve and a half years in which he did not even sit for a time, attained Kevalgyana and then preached Dharma for thirty years. Where he preached has been a subject of disagreement between the two major traditions of Jainism: \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara and  Digambara traditions.It is uncertain when Mahavira was born and when he died.  One view is that Mahavira was born in 540 BCE and died in 443 BCE. The Barli Inscription in Prakrit language which was inscribed in 443 BCE (year 84 of the Vira Nirvana Samvat), contains the line Viraya Bhagavate chaturasiti vase, which can be interpreted as \"dedicated to Lord Vira in his 84th year\", 84 years after the Nirvana of the Mahavira. However, palaeographic analysis dates the inscription to the 2nd-1st century BCE. According to Buddhist and Jain texts, Buddha and Mahavira are believed to have been contemporaries which is supported by much ancient Buddhist literature.A firmly-established part of the Jain tradition is that the Vira Nirvana Samvat era began in 527 BCE (with Mahavira's nirvana). The 12th-century Jain scholar Hemachandracharya placed Mahavira in the 6th century BCE. According to Jain tradition, the traditional date of 527 BCE is accurate; the Buddha was younger than Mahavira and \"might have attained nirvana a few years later\". The place of his nirvana, Pavapuri in present-day Bihar, is a pilgrimage site for Jains."

As scholarship progressed, differences between the teachings of Mahavira and the Buddha were found so divergent that the religions were acknowledged as separate. Mahavira, says Moriz Winternitz, taught a \"very elaborate belief in the soul\" (unlike the Buddhists, who denied such elaboration). His ascetic teachings have a higher order of magnitude than those of Buddhism or Hinduism, and his emphasis on ahimsa (non-violence) is greater than that in other Indian religions."

During this period, he accompanied many jazz musicians, such as Sarah Vaughan.Danilo Caymmi won third place in TV Globo's Festival Internacional da Can\u00e7\u00e3o (International Song Festival), third edition in 1968 with Andan\u00e7a (written with Edmundo Souto and Paulinho Tapaj\u00f3s).

Another of his biggest hits came a year later, \"Casaco Marrom (Bye Bye, Ceci),\" written with Guarabira and Renato Correia (the latter being one of the Golden Boys), with which he won the 1969 festival of Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais and also had several re-recordings. As was the case with Andan\u00e7a, this song served to launch another new star, this time Jovem Guarda music style outfit Trio Esperan\u00e7a vocalist Evinha.In 1977 Caymmi went to Bahia, where he collaborated with Tom & Dito, this time playing brass instruments. A year later, Caymmi borrowed money to record and produce 10 thousand copies of his first independent work and most well known compilation Cheiro Verde.As a solo artist, he has recorded seven albums, interpreting his compositions.In 1983, Danilo joined Jobim's musical group, Banda Nova, a family ensemble featuring Jobim's wife, Ana Lontra Jobim, and his son and daughter, Paulo and Elizabeth, as well as Jacques Morelembaum and his wife, Paula, and Danilo Caymmi and his wife, Simone.In 1999, Caymmi recorded with American jazz musician David Liebman, working from a Jobim songbook. In this jazz and bossa nova collection, Caymmi sang in what is described as a \"rich baritone\".To commemorate his father's 90th birthday, in 2004, Danilo and his brother Dori and sister Nana recorded a compact disc, titled Para Caymmi de Nana, Dori e Danilo (To Caymmi from Nana, Dori and Danilo), featuring Dorival Caymmi's greatest hits.

Mozart wrote to Puchberg a series of \"begging letters,\" of increasing desperate tone. Puchberg responded with a series of loans, ranging in size from 30 to 300 florins, and totalling about 1400 florins.\n\nAndrew Steptoe (1984) has discussed the series of 21 letters Mozart wrote to Puchberg asking for loans. He notes that \"Mozart's early requests stress the bond of mutual aid and comfort,\" giving the following example:\n\nI have now opened my whole heart to you in a matter which is of the utmost importance to me; that is, I have acted as a true brother. But it is only with a true brother that one can be perfectly frank. And now I look forward eagerly to your reply, which I do hope will be favourable . . . I take you to be a man who ... will like myself certainly assist a friend, if he be a true friend, or his brother, if he be indeed a brother. [letter of 17 June 1788]\"Over the next year,\" Steptoe adds, \"Mozart's tone changed to desperation:\"\n\nGreat God! I would not wish my worst enemy to be in my present position. And if you, most beloved friend and brother, forsake me, we are altogether lost, both my unfortunate and blameless self and my poor sick wife and child. [letter of 12 July 1789]Steptoe continues: \"At times, the composer's self-respect deserted him completely, as he begged for pittances:\"\n\nIn a week or fortnight I shall be better off--certainly--but at present I am in want! Can you not help me out with a trifle? The smallest sum would be very welcome just now. [letter of 14 August 1790]However, in 2009 the musicologist Michael Lorenz showed that at the time when Mozart pretended to be in dire straits, he had certainly not reduced his expenses (as claimed in one of his letters to Puchberg), but lived in a spacious apartment on the Alsergrund that cost him 250 florins a year. At that time he also owned a carriage and a horse. Thus there is a good case to assume that Mozart might have vastly exaggerated his financial problems just to get money from Puchberg."

While Farhat Nadir Rizvi, in her research, has propounded that Anis was narrating recorded history and was therefore restricted in use of pure imagination and fantasy, yet he dexterously harnessed the art of storytelling in his work and we cannot but accept that he was not only a Marsiya writer but also a successful storyteller. Anis has been compared with Shakespeare. Shakespeare creates imaginary plots and characters so beautifully that they appear real to the reader; Anis narrates events and characters fossilized in history so vividly that they become alive in the eyes of his audience.Anis is also known as a pioneer in Rubai, an Urdu poetry branch, and enjoys status akin to that of Mirza Sauda, Khwaja Mir Dard and Dabeer. \nBesides being a master of the Marsia, Anis was also a specialist of the Rubai, the shortest complete poem in Urdu, containing only four lines. He enriched the contents of the Rubai, making it much more colorful and multi-dimensional. Anis introduced the tragic events of Karbala and their moralistic effect to Rubai. Thus, he widened the scope of Rubai to unfathomable limits. The inclusion of Karbala resulted in the florescence of the Urdu Rubai. Thus, many internal and external aspects of our life found their echo in the Urdu Rubai."

These are Bellori's words:\n\n[...]hence Benedetto, his father, as soon as he saw that he was being outstripped by his son in his childhood, no longer having the courage to educate him, wisely thought to provide him with a better master and recommended him to Cavalier Giuseppe d\u2019Arpino, who gladly took him into his school, perceiving him to be more attentive and bent on progress than any other youth.:\u200a375\u200a\nSacchi later entered Francesco Albani's workshop and spent most of his time in Rome where he eventually died.

        "content": "As a young man, Sacchi had worked under Cortona at the Villa Sacchetti at Castelfusano (1627\u20131629). But in a set of public debates at the Accademia di San Luca, the guild for artists in Rome, he strongly criticized Cortona's exuberance. The debate is significant because it indicates how two of the leading proponents of the prevailing styles in painting, now called 'Classical' and 'Baroque', discussed the differences between their work.\nIn particular, Sacchi advocated that since a unique, individual expression, gesture and movement needed to be assigned to each figure in a composition, so a painting should only have a few figures.:\u200a263\u200a In a crowded composition, the figures would be deprived of individuality, and thus cloud the particular meaning of the piece. In some ways this was a reaction against the zealous excess of crowds in paintings by artists such as Zuccari in the previous generation, and by Cortona among his contemporaries. Simplicity and unity were essential to Sacchi who, drawing an analogy to poetry, likened painting to tragedy. In his counter-argument, Cortona made the case that large paintings with many figures were like an epic which could develop multiple sub-themes. But for Sacchi, the encrustation of a painting with excess decorative details, including melees of crowds, would represent something akin to 'wall-paper' art rather than focused narrative. Among the partisans of Sacchi's argument for simplicity and focus were his friends, the sculptor Algardi and painter Poussin. The controversy was however less pitched and monolithic than some might suggest. In fact, Poussin's biographer Bellori recounts that the artist 'used to laugh at those who contract for a [history painting] with six or eight figures or some other fixed number.':\u200a343\u200a Sacchi and Albani, among others, shared dissatisfaction with the artistic depiction of low or genre subjects and themes, such as those preferred by the Bamboccianti and even the Caravaggisti. They felt that high art should focus on exalted themes\u2014biblical, mythological, or from classical ancient history.\nSacchi, who worked almost always in Rome, left few pictures visible in private galleries. He had a flourishing school: Carlo Maratta was a younger collaborator or pupil. In Maratta's large studio, Sacchi's preference for a grand manner style would find pre-eminence among Roman circles for decades to follow. But many others worked under him or his influence including Francesco Fiorelli, Luigi Garzi, Francesco Lauri, Andrea Camassei, and Giacinto Gimignani. Sacchi's own illegitimate son Giuseppe, died young after high hopes for his future.Sacchi died at Nettuno in 1661."

        "content": "Karl Z\u00e9ro is the youngest son of Gui Tellenne, a civil servant and poet, and Annick Tellenne, an author and talk-show host. He has three brothers: \u00c9ric, a writer under the name of Raoul Rabut, Bruno (aka Basile de Koch) and Olivier, a business executive. In the late 1970s \u00c9ric, Bruno and Marc founded the satirical comedy troupe Groupe d'Intervention culturelle Jalons. 1979 Z\u00e9ro met his later wife and mother of their three children Anne-Laure Chaptel (today's stage name: Daisy d'Errata) in the lyceum both were attending. Anne-Laure as well as Bruno\u2019s wife Virginie (Frigide Barjot) later on became members of the Jalons.\nZ\u00e9ro's first publication was a comic entitled The Adventures of Edmond in the magazine Jalons in the early 1980s. Subsequently, he started to work for the publications M\u00e9tal Hurlant, Charlie Hebdo, Zoulou, and L'\u00c9cho des savanes, first as an artist and then as a story writer. At the same time, in 1981, he started working for the trendy magazine Actuel as a journalist specialising in interviewing stars. He also joined the just formed team of Radio Nova, working alongside his future wife, Daisy d\u2019Errata. He then joined Globe and Lui, where his talents as an interviewer attracted notice. For a few months he hosted a comedy radio show on RFM with Antoine de Caunes and Albert Algoud called Babebibou.\nIn 1986, Karl Z\u00e9ro was hired by Europe 1 to host their show G\u00e9ant Gratuit (Free Giant) with Doug Headline (son of Jean-Patrick Manchette). They would be let go after four months. Z\u00e9ro then returned to TF1 while Doug devoted himself to film. At TF1, Z\u00e9ro's show Pirates with Jean-Yves Lafesse lasted for only one episode in September 1987. Again, his sense of humour was considered 'inappropriate' and he was let go.\nAlain de Greef of Canal+ (a French pay for view TV channel) then offered him the direction of Nulle part ailleurs (Nowhere else) with his old collaborator Antoine de Caunes. He made use of video gags to bring political personalities into his sketches, which often focussed on current events. In 1993 he successfully proposed adding a television news report parody called \"Zerorama\", \"telling events of moral rearmament\", in which he used a mode of presentation and tone inspired by newsreels of the Vichy regime under Philippe P\u00e9tain in order to satirise \u00c9douard Balladur's government and the media supporting it. Also in 1993, he directed an offbeat film called Le Tronc, in which he appeared alongside Albert Algoud, Jos\u00e9 Garcia and Lova Moor.\nFrom September 1996 to June 2006, he was the presenter of Le Vrai Journal on Canal +, a television news show with the intention of 'saying out loud' what other French news shows 'kept hidden'. Karl Z\u00e9ro is not a journalist and does not have press credentials. In the show, he mixed classic news reports, usually filmed by the CAPA Agency, and sketches using video gags, in which his wife Daisy d'Errata frequently played a part. When talking with politicians, he attempted to make them accept the informal mode of address. Over 10 seasons, his audience remained steady at a 10% market share, i.e., 1.5 million viewers a week. He became the reference point for politicians who wanted to reach young people.\nBetween 2000 and 2002, he published a printed offshoot of the show, le Vrai Papier Journal. Also from September 2001 to June 2002, at the suggestion of Eric Guillaumond, he co-produced with Michel Malaussena Le journal des bonnes nouvelles, also on Canal +. In March 2003 this was renamed Le contre-journal. He also produced 60 jours 60 nuits, which told the story of the intersecting lives of Joeystarr and Francis Lalanne.\nIn 2004, Z\u00e9ro also hosted C\u2019est quoi ce jeu? on Canal +.\nIn 1996, when Le Vrai journal was beginning, Karl Z\u00e9ro agreed to John Paul Lepers' request that he meet with Pierre Carles, who had been censured a year earlier by Canal + for his film criticising TV journalism, Pas vu \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9. Carles proposed filming an expos\u00e9 of Canal + censorship, which Z\u00e9ro was naturally unable to do on that same network. Carles' second proposal, on Jacques Chirac's practice of choosing the journalists who would interview him, notably Michel Field, who at the time also worked for Canal +, was also rejected, this time by Alain de Greef, who was head of programming. In 1998 Carles produced a film titled Pas vu pas pris in which he juxtaposed statements by Karl Z\u00e9ro on his desire to say and show anything on his show with telephone conversations between the two in which he alluded to oversight by his bosses. Z\u00e9ro, for his part, deplored Carles' wasting his time \"beating down open doors\", saying that \"When one works for a television network, they're the ones who have the final cut\".\nA Catholic, Karl Z\u00e9ro nonetheless does not hide his sympathy for alter-mundialist positions.  His shows are produced by his own production company, La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du spectacle, which is currently 50% owned by Endemol, which specialises in reality television.\nIn June 2003, with network consent and without naming them, he read aloud on the air the accusations of the serial killer Patrice Al\u00e8gre (in the form of a letter which he had received from him) and of two former prostitutes that certain prominent people in Toulouse were involved in a sado-masochistic group which had covered up sexual assault, torture and murder. One of the accused was later found innocent. It also appeared that Z\u00e9ro had paid one of the ex-prostitutes \u20ac15,000 as an advance on a book. The possible violation of journalistic ethics, frequent mentions of Z\u00e9ro and Canal + in publicity about the accusations, and resulting political pressure contributed to the termination of his contract for Le Vrai Journal in June 2006. After three years of investigation, in March 2007 Judge Nathalie Turquey excused Karl Z\u00e9ro from the necessity of appearing in the case, subject to future appeals.Karl Z\u00e9ro's blog, video, and forum site Web 2 Z\u00e9ro has hosted many videos by his fans, the 'z\u00e9ronautes', and interviews especially with September 11 Truth advocates, a position in which he is interested. Also online, in 2006\u201307 he hosted on AOL Le Club du Net, a weekly round-up of interviews concerning the French presidential election campaign produced by Power Podcast, and in mid-March 2007 JT2Zero, a daily video on demand online newscast about the campaign produced by Havas Media. Z\u00e9ro supported the candidacy of Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, and in his official campaign clips, Z\u00e9ro was the interviewer.\nSince September 2007, Karl Z\u00e9ro has hosted a segment called \"Les Faits Karl Z\u00e9ro\" on 13e Rue, a show on unsolved crimes produced by Troisi\u00e8me \u0152il, and beginning in spring 2010 was to host 90-minute spin-off shows in prime time.\nIn January 2008, he accepted a position as head of the media division of the Belgian holding group Rentabiliweb.\nSince September 2008, Karl Z\u00e9ro has had a daily prime-time show on BFM TV. Initially an interview show called Karl Z\u00e9ro sur BFM TV and inspired by CNN's Larry King Live, following the 2008 release of his film Starko! la saison 1 on Nicolas Sarkozy's first year as President of France, on 7 September 2009 this became Sarko Info, a parody of television news shows in which he conducts an interview following a commentary on the news by Michel Guidoni playing the part of Sarkozy as he already did in the movie."

According to Rauf Ahmed, though the film was not a success at the box-office, Sajid's performance was praised by the critics. After his father's death in 1964, Sajid moved to the United States where he did his further education. \nKhan went on to achieve fame in the United States with a co-starring role alongside Jay North in the 1966 film Maya. The film's success led to a television series of the same name airing on NBC from September 1967 to February 1968 and lasting 18 episodes. The show led to Sajid becoming a \"teen idol\" for a short time, appearing on the cover of popular magazines. He also had a short-lived singing career, releasing a self titled album. \nIn 1968, he guest-starred in an episode of the television series The Big Valley, and appeared in the music variety show It's Happening as a guest judge.\nIn the late 1960s, the actress Rekha was struggling to gain a foothold in films. She was a south Indian who spoke Hindi badly but whose English was good. At this time, several English language films and television serials with an Indian theme were being made, like Jungle Book and Maya. So, she thought of looking for roles as an Indian woman in foreign language films. She approached Khan, who was himself acting in Maya, and he tried to help her get some a bit role in the film, but failed. Shortly afterwards, Rekha made her Hindi language debut with Sawan Bhadon (1970), which was a hit, and her career in Hindi films was assured.\nKhan also found success in the Philippines in the early 1970s, starring as the male lead in a number of romantic comedy films opposite leading Philippine actresses Nora Aunor and Vilma Santos. He tried to get back into Hindi films, but none of his Hindi films from 1972 to 1983 worked financially. His career's peak period was in 1966\u20131974 and he was more successful in English films. His last film appearance was in the Merchant Ivory film Heat and Dust in 1983, where he played the role of \"dacoit chief,\" seen fleetingly in only one scene with no spoken dialogue whatsoever."

Soon he promoted as the head coach of the men's team of Akadimia Ilioupolis where at that time were playing in the C division.For two consecutive seasons he worked as an assistant coach for the A2 team of Milonas where they celebrated the second place which was leading to the A1 division.The next two years he worked at the A1 team of Dafni as the assistant coach of Kostas Missas and Dirk Bauermann.One of his career's milestones was the job offered to him by Slobodan Suboti\u0107 as his assistant of EuroLeague team Olympiacos for the 2001\u201302 season, where they celebrated the Greek Cup and reached the finals of the Greek League and the last 16 of the EuroLeague. The next season he again worked with Missas at Panionios. In 2004 he was the head coach of the B league team Papagos. In 2006 he was the assistant coach of Kalafatakis at the A1 team Panellinios. That season the team finished fifth and secured a place in the ULEB Cup.Between 2008 and 2010, he was the head coach of the women's club Athinaikos. With the team, he became the Greek champion, finishing two seasons without losing any games, putting the biggest base for breaking the world record of 105 wins in a row. In 2010, Athinaikos won the triple crown (Greek Championship, Greek Cup and Eurocup). During the season, he also became the head coach of the Latvia women's basketball team.In January 2011, Dikeoulakos accepted the offer from the Polish EuroLeague team Lotos Gdynia, with whom he won the Polish Cup.\nIn May 2011 he moved to Turkey and signed with Fenerbah\u00e7e Istanbul. With the team, he won the Turkish championship and reached the EuroLeague Final 4 for the first time in the history of the club. Although it was a successful season, at the end of the season he left. In June 2012 he accepted the two-year contract from the Romanian team CSM T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte. In January 2013, the club announced that Dikeoulakos was sacked although the team was ranked first in the Romanian League and already secured the EuroLeague playoffs. The reason for that conflict was that the club was forcing the coach and the players to accept a salary reduction.In the meantime he was leading the Greece women's national team, when in November 2013 he accepted the offer of the Russian EuroLeague club Nadezhda from Orenburg. Under his coaching, the Russian club reached the EuroLeague Final 4 for the first time in their history, and finished in the second place for two consecutive seasons, the best position they ever made. In the first final they beat UMMC Yekaterinburg on the road but they didn't manage to take the championship. In May 2015, he announced that he would leave the club due to personal reasons. A few hours later, the Turkish team Fenerbah\u00e7e announced Dikeoulakos as their new head coach.In Fenerbah\u00e7e he stayed for two years and the result of this cooperation was one championship, one cup, one super cup and two participations in the EuroLeague Final 4.In June 2017, he returned to Poland and signed for the EuroLeague team CCC Polkowice.In May 2018 he moved to China and joined Shanxi Xing Rui.The 2019\u201320 season found him back at Nadezhda Orenburg. They were stabilized in the third place of the Russian League, and also finished third in their group in EuroLeague. In the play-off games and the entry to the EuroLeague Final 4 they played against Lyon in France on 11 March 2020, and won 80\u201378. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the remainder of the 2019\u201320 season was cancelled.In June 2021, the Italian team Famila Schio announced Dikeoulakos as their new head coach for the next three years. In his first season, he won all three trophies in Italy (Italian Championship, Italian Cup and Italian Supercup), a feat he also repeated in 2022\u201323. Furthermore, he led Famila Schio to the Final 4 tournament of the 2022\u201323 EuroLeague Women, where they won bronze medal after defeating ZVVZ USK Praha in the third-place game."

He was the son of Field Marshal Michael Gallitzin and grandson of Prince Boris Kurakin. \nIn the late 1750s, Prince Gallitzin resided in Paris, where he headed the Russian embassy during the Seven Years' War. His wife Catherine died there in 1761. Her liaison with actress La Clairon gained great notoriety. Catherine was the daughter of Dimitrie Cantemir, the former ruler of Moldavia, by Princess Anastasiya Trubetskaya. She was also the sister of Antiochus Cantemir.\n\nFrom 1761 to 1792 he was Russian ambassador to Austria, with the poet Ludwig Heinrich von Nicolay as his secretary. Catherine the Great bestowed on him the Order of St. Andrew for negotiating the First Partition of Poland with Emperor Joseph II. The prince was acclaimed for having returned to Russia the lands annexed by his patrilineal ancestor, Grand Duke Gediminas. In the winter of 1782, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was engaged for all the concerts given by Gallitzin who \"placed his carriage at my disposal both going and returning, and treated me in the handsomest manner possible\". Gallitzinberg is the hill near Vienna where the Russian ambassador built his residence (with an artificial Roman ruin and a round temple still standing). Gallitzinstra\u00dfe in Vienna is also named after him.\nThe childless Prince Gallitzin, wishing to keep the memory of his wife alive for future generations, spent a fortune to establish the Golitsyn Hospital in Moscow. His palace in Vienna boasted several hundred paintings by Old Masters. After his death, these paintings were exhibited in the gallery of the Golitsyn Hospital before being auctioned off in order to finance the hospital's extension."

        "content": "Sen Yung made his first significant acting debut in the 1938 film Charlie Chan in Honolulu, as the Chinese detective's \"number two son\", Jimmy Chan. In this movie, Sidney Toler replaced the recently deceased Warner Oland as Charlie Chan and Sen Yung replaced Oland's \"number one son\" Lee, who had been played by Keye Luke. Luke left the series in 1938, leading to the need for a \"number two son\". Sen Yung played Jimmy Chan in 11 Charlie Chan films between 1938 and 1942. Sen Yung played the character of Jimmy Chan very much as Luke played Lee Chan, namely as the bumbling, Americanized son who constantly hinders his father's work. The cultural clash between Chan p\u00e8re, a Chinese immigrant whose values were fundamentally those of China as expressed in his amusing pseudo-Confucian aphorisms vs. his well meaning, but inept Americanized sons gave the series much of its appeal, together with the fact that for all of Charlie Chan's putdowns of his sons there was a genuine paternal love and warmth being expressed.Moonlighting from the popular Chan series, Sen Yung won critical acclaim playing the nuanced role of Ong Chi Seng, a young attorney assisting Howard Joyce (played by James Stephenson), defending Leslie Crosbie (played by Bette Davis), accused of murder in the classic Warner Bros. film noir melodrama, The Letter (1940), directed by William Wyler. In common with other Chinese-American actors, Sen Yung was cast in Japanese parts during World War II, such as his role as the treacherous Japanese-American Joe Totsuiko in the 1942 Humphrey Bogart film Across the Pacific.\nDuring World War II he joined the U.S. Army Air Forces just as his erstwhile co-star Sidney Toler was set to revive the dormant Charlie Chan series at Monogram Pictures. According to author James L. Neibaur, Sen Yung's military obligations forced him to decline rejoining the series immediately, but Monogram gave him a standing invitation to work there when his tour of duty was up. He was temporarily replaced in the Charlie Chan series by Benson Fong, who played \"number three son\" Tommy Chan (and once by Keye Luke's real-life brother, Edwin Luke, as \"number four son\" Eddie Chan). Sen Yung's military service included work in training films at the First Motion Picture Unit and a role in the Army Air Forces' play and film Winged Victory.\nIn 1946 Sen Yung resumed his Hollywood career at Monogram, now billed as Victor Sen Young and reunited with Sidney Toler. Toler's health was failing; Monogram was conserving Toler's waning energy, limiting his scenes and giving him long rest periods during filming. To relieve the burden on Toler, Monogram entrusted much of the action to Victor Sen Young; he and either Mantan Moreland or Willie Best shared much of the footage in Toler's final three films, Dangerous Money, Shadows Over Chinatown, and The Trap. The addition of Moreland as Chan's black chauffeur, Birmingham Brown, reflected the fact that by this time the Chan pictures had a significant following among black Americans, who liked a film series that for once did not feature a white hero. Moreland's popularity in the Chan pictures was so great that he was booked for a nationwide vaudeville tour, forcing him to be replaced in Dangerous Money by Willie Best.\nFollowing Toler's death in 1947, Victor Sen Young appeared in five of the remaining six Charlie Chan features. His character \"Jimmy\" was renamed \"Tommy\" (author Scott MacGillivray contends that \"Jimmy\" was so closely associated with Sidney Toler that audiences would miss seeing Toler opposite him, resulting in Monogram making the change).  \nVictor Sen Young continued to work in motion pictures and television, in roles ranging from featured players (affable or earnest Asian characters) to bit roles (clerks, houseboys, waiters, etc.). He was cast as the compassionate Chinese restaurant owner \"Quong Kee\" in Tombstone, Arizona, in the 1957 episode, \"Quong Kee\", of the syndicated television anthology series Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story, an aging Quong Kee recalls how in 1881 he brought together the Bostonians Art Gresham (Walter Kelley) and his mother (played by Mary Newton) with the saloon musician Ann Bailey (Eugenia Paul), who after a topsy-turvy romance became Mrs. Art Gresham.Arguably even more than for his work in the Charlie Chan films, Victor Sen Yung is well remembered as \"Hop Sing,\" the irascible cook and general factotum on the iconic television series Bonanza, appearing in 107 episodes between 1959 and 1973.Bonanza series creator David Dortort told the Archive of American Television that the \"Hop Sing\" character generated massive fandom - \"Victor was just absolutely delightful. He loved the part; he loved doing it. In fact, he began to develop fans, to the extent that I wrote him in as the featured part in a number of shows.\u201dIn Bachelor Father (1957-62), Victor Sen Yung had a recurring role as the scheming \"Uncle Charlie\", a character that Asian rights activist Guy Aoki commends as \"a slick, Americanized character. I thought it was great that way back in the \u201950s, audiences saw a Chinese American who acted just like anyone else.\"In the early 1970s, Sen Yung had a recurring role in seven episodes of the tv series Kung Fu, which starred David Carradine as a Shaolin monk, also in the Old West.\nSen Yung was also an accomplished and talented chef. He frequently appeared on cooking programs, and authored The Great Wok Cookbook in 1974."

Throughout his career, Belushi had a personal and artistic partnership with his fellow SNL star Dan Aykroyd, whom he met while they were both working at Chicago's Second City comedy club.Born in Chicago to Albanian-American parents, Belushi started his own comedy troupe with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas, called \"The West Compass Trio\". After being discovered by Bernard Sahlins, he performed with The Second City and met Dan Aykroyd, Brian Doyle-Murray, and Harold Ramis. In 1975, Chevy Chase and Michael O'Donoghue recommended Belushi to SNL creator and showrunner Lorne Michaels, who accepted him as a new cast member of the show after an audition. Belushi developed a series of characters on the show that reached great success, including his performances as Henry Kissinger and Ludwig van Beethoven. Belushi appeared in the films National Lampoon's Animal House, 1941, The Blues Brothers, and Neighbors. He also pursued interests in music: with Aykroyd, Lou Marini, Tom Malone, Steve Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, and Paul Shaffer, he founded The Blues Brothers, which led to the film of the same name.\nBelushi struggled with heavy drug abuse that threatened his comedy career; more than once, he was dismissed from SNL due to his behavior (and then rehired). In 1982, he died from combined drug intoxication at the age of 33, after a drug dealer, Cathy Smith, injected him with a mixture of heroin and cocaine (known as a speedball) at the Chateau Marmont. He was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004."

        "content": "John Adam Belushi was born to Agnes Demetri (n\u00e9e Samaras) Belushi and Adam Anastos Belushi in Humboldt Park, a neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago, Illinois. Agnes, a pharmacy worker, was born in Ohio to Albanian immigrants from Kor\u00e7\u00eb, while Adam was an Albanian immigrant from Qytez\u00eb, who owned the Fair Oaks restaurant on North Avenue in Chicago, and later established a restaurant in the Chicago suburb of Wheaton, Illinois.Belushi was raised in Wheaton along with his three siblings \u2013 younger brothers Billy and Jim, and sister Marian. He was Eastern Orthodox Christian, attending the Albanian Orthodox Church. He was educated at Wheaton Central High School, where he met his future wife, Judith Jacklin.In 1965, Belushi formed a band, the Ravens, together with four fellow high-school students (Dick Blasucci, Michael Blasucci, Tony Pavilonis, and Phil Special). They recorded one single, \"Listen to Me Now/Jolly Green Giant\". Belushi played drums and sang vocals. The record was not successful, and the band broke up when he enrolled at the College of DuPage. He also attended the University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater for a year, which inspired the Animal House scene of D-Day driving a motorcycle up the stairs. Belushi acquired the iconic \"College\" crewneck, worn by his character in Animal House, at a print shop when visiting his brother Jim, who attended Southern Illinois University."

        "content": "Belushi struggled with drug addiction during most of his adult life. He began using cocaine (both snorting and freebasing) in the early to mid 1970s. He had managed to refrain from drug use for a brief period during the production of Continental Divide, but severely relapsed during the production of Neighbors. Less than four months after the filming on Neighbors ended, on the evening of February 28, 1982, Belushi moved out of his house and checked in to a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. For several days, he did drugs in his bungalow and wandered from nightclub to nightclub on the Sunset Strip and on Santa Monica Blvd.On March 4, 1982, Belushi visited the Los Angeles office of his long-time manager Bernie Brillstein and asked him for money. Brillstein declined, suspecting that Belushi wanted money for drugs. Later that day, Belushi returned and again asked for money while Brillstein was in a meeting with someone. Brillstein was reluctant to rebuke Belushi in front of the other person and gave him the money. In the early morning hours of March 5, Belushi, while in his Chateau Marmont bungalow, was visited separately by friends Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, as well as drug dealer Cathy Smith.Around 12:00 pm PST on Friday, March 5, 1982, Belushi's fitness trainer and occasional bodyguard Bill Wallace arrived at Belushi's bungalow at the Chateau Marmont to deliver a typewriter and audio cassette recorder because Belushi had requested them the previous day. Wallace found Belushi dead, with no one else present in the bungalow. Neither law enforcement nor a representative of the coroner's office revealed any details for almost six days. On the morning of March 11, Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi announced that the cause of death was combined drug intoxication involving cocaine and heroin, a drug combination known as a speedball.Belushi's death was eventually investigated by forensic pathologist Michael Baden who determined his death was caused by heroin.Cathy Smith was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) on March 5, 1982, because she was under suspicion for possession of narcotics, not because of Belushi's death. Later in 1982, Rolling Stone magazine described the circumstances of her arrest as follows: \"On the afternoon of March 5th, Cathy Evelyn Smith had appeared driving the wrong way into the one-way exit of the Chateau Marmont Hotel on Sunset Strip behind the wheel of John Belushi's rented red Mercedes ... At that moment, a hundred feet away, Belushi lay naked and dead on the floor of his $200-a-day bungalow. The police who had cordoned off the area were reflexively insisting it had been 'death from natural causes'.\" The LAPD released Smith after questioning.In an interview with the National Enquirer in May 1982, Smith admitted that she had been with Belushi at the Chateau Marmont on the night of his death and had given him the fatal speedball shot. After the appearance of the Enquirer article, the case was reopened. Smith was arrested, extradited from Canada, and charged with first-degree murder. Her case was delayed by lawyers' negotiations for four years while she remained free, then she was convicted and incarcerated. A plea bargain reduced the charge to involuntary manslaughter, and she served fifteen months in prison.\nSmith, 39, pleaded no contest June 11, 1986, to involuntary manslaughter and three counts of furnishing and administering controlled substances to Belushi, 33, in the hours before he was found dead on March 5, 1982, in a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont hotel in West Hollywood.\n\nJohn Belushi would not have died when he died except for the heroin that was furnished and administered by the defendant.\u2014 LA county prosecutor's office\nIn 1982, Belushi's widow Judith arranged for a traditional Orthodox Christian funeral that was conducted by an Albanian Orthodox priest."

        "content": "During the first live SNL episode following Belushi's death with host Robert Urich and musical guest Mink DeVille, airing live on March 20, 1982, cast member Brian Doyle-Murray gave a tribute to him. During the preproduction of Ghostbusters, Reitman remarked that Slimer bore a resemblance to Belushi's character Bluto from Animal House. Since then, Slimer has been described as \"the ghost of John Belushi\" by Aykroyd in many interviews.\nBelushi's life was detailed in two books: the 1984 biography Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi by Bob Woodward, the accuracy of which has been questioned by journalists and by people close to Belushi, and the 1990 memoir Samurai Widow by his widow Judith. Woodward's book was adapted into a film of the same name in 1989, which was denounced by Aykroyd and Judith, and was given poor reviews by critics. Belushi's career and death were prominently featured in the 1999 memoir of his manager Bernie Brillstein, who wrote that he was haunted by the comedian's overdose and had since learned how to better deal with clients who abuse drugs or alcohol.Eddie Money wrote \"Passing by the Graveyard (Song for John B.)\", from his 1982 album No Control, in tribute to Belushi. The two became friends after Money was a musical guest on SNL during the show's third season. The thrash metal group Anthrax penned a song about Belushi on their 1987 album Among the Living, titled \"Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.).\" Polish rock band Lady Pank recorded a song \"John Belushi\" for their 1988 album Tacy sami, with references to his Albanian ancestry.\nBelushi has been portrayed by actors Eric Siegel in Gilda Radner: It's Always Something, Tyler Labine in Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Mork & Mindy (which also features his friendship with Robin Williams), Michael Chiklis in Wired, and John Gemberling in A Futile and Stupid Gesture. Chris Farley, who was heavily influenced by Belushi, died in 1997 at age 33 due to a drug overdose, which has fueled many comparisons between Belushi and Farley.\nIn 2004, Belushi was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star located at 6355 Hollywood Boulevard. In 2006, Biography Channel aired an episode of Final 24, a documentary following Belushi during the last 24 hours leading to his death. Four years later, Biography aired a full documentary of Belushi's life. In 2015, Belushi was ranked by Rolling Stone as the greatest SNL cast member of all time.Belushi's widow later remarried and is now Judith Jacklin Belushi Pisano. Co-biographer Tanner Colby and she produced Belushi: A Biography, a collection of first-person interviews and photographs of Belushi's life that was published in 2005.\nAccording to SNL castmate Jane Curtin, who appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2011, Belushi was a misogynist who would deliberately sabotage the work of female writers and comics while working on the show: \"So you'd go to a table read, and if a woman writer had written a piece for John, he would not read it in his full voice. He felt as though it was his duty to sabotage pieces written by women.\" SNL writer Anne Beatts suggested that because she was writing a book with his wife at the time, Belushi was frustrated with them spending more time on the book than with him. He complained to Michaels about Beatts and Rosie Shuster. Judith said that Belushi was a \"Women's Libber\" and did not hate women."

From 1824 to 1839, he was the editor of C\u00e4cilia, a musical periodical published in Mainz, which influenced musical thought in Germany during the early Romantic era.\nHis most important work is his Versuch einer geordneten Theorie der Tonsetzkunst (\"Theory of Musical Composition\") (Mainz: B. Schott, 1817\u201321), which introduced several concepts that have since become important in the study of music theory. In this work, Weber develops the idea of \"Mehrdeutigkeit\" (that is, \"multiple meaning\"), a term initially introduced by Georg Joseph Vogler. Weber's \"multiple meaning\" refers to individual tones and harmonies, based on their context in a piece of music. For example, a C major triad may serve as I in C major, IV in G major, V in F major, etc. \"To analyze a chord, a theorist must ask not only 'What notes are in it?' but also 'How is it behaving in the harmonic progression?'\" (Thompson); see diatonic function. In the same work, Weber also further develops Vogler's idea of Roman numeral designations applied to chords. Unlike Vogler, Weber implements upper and lower case symbols to show not only the position of each chord related to the scale degree upon which it is built, but also the quality of each chord, i.e. major, minor, diminished, etc. Weber's Roman numeral system of analysis is in wide use in universities all over the world today to varying degrees, albeit with some modifications.\nWeber's Theory of Musical Composition was the first work on music theory to be translated into English for publication in the United States (transl. by James F. Warner, Boston: Oliver Ditson, 1846).\nHe died in Bad Kreuznach."

The film also follows the efforts of Sam Itauma, a human rights activist and founder of the Child Rights and Rehabilitation Network (CRARN), who offers shelter and protection to children who have been abused or abandoned, and Gary Foxcroft, who founded Stepping Stones Nigeria, a UK-registered charity.In 2009, Igwe represented the International Humanist and Ethical Union at the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights in Banjul, Gambia, where he spoke out on the IHEU's behalf against caste-based discrimination in Africa. In his talk, Igwe brought attention to discrimination against the Osu, a group of people perceived by some to be of lower class, who Igwe says \"continue to suffer discrimination and indignity, particularly in the areas of marriage and family, right to own property and inheritance, access to land, political rights and representation, education, development, infrastructure, and distribution of basic amenities.\"In 2010, according to a release by the European Humanist Federation (EHF), Igwe's home was invaded by soldiers and police officers \"following a fictitious murder charge,\" which was allegedly brought on by a man that Igwe had attempted to have prosecuted for allegedly committing sexual crimes against a 10-year-old girl in 2006. According to the report, Igwe had been arrested three times since beginning work on the rape case, as a result of allegedly malicious petitions, prompting David Pollock of the EHF to write to then vice-president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, on Igwe's behalf.According to the EHF, later in August 2010, Igwe's home and family were attacked when two unidentified men assaulted and blindfolded Igwe's father, causing \"extensive injuries to his face and head\", and resulting in the elder Igwe having to have his eye surgically removed. The case has been taken up by Amnesty International after police reportedly refused to open an investigation.On 11 January 2011, while attempting to rescue two children who were victims of witchcraft accusation in Uyo Akwa State in southern Nigeria, Igwe was \"imprisoned and beaten by police,\" in an effort, according to Sahara Reporters, by the state governor Godswill Akpabio, to begin \"clamping down on activists involved in the rescue of children accused of witchcraft.\" Igwe was later released without charge, according to Gary Foxcroft of Stepping Stones Nigeria, and \"in good spirits\".\nOn 11 February 2014, Igwe was chosen as a laureate of the International Academy of Humanism.\n In 2017, he was given the Distinguished Services to Humanism Award from the International Humanist and Ethical Union General Assembly. Upon receiving the award, Igwe dedicated it \"to all humanists at risk around the globe\".Igwe is an outspoken supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations. When discussing the matter, Igwe has argued that \"the United Nations needs to be handed back to those to whom it actually belongs - the people of the world.\"Igwe continues to speak out against attacks on alleged witches in Malawi. According to him, recent cases of such attacks in December 2019 and January 2020 \"...contained seeds of an effective advocacy against witch persecution in Malawi. First of all there is an urgent need for advocates for alleged witches throughout the country to become more visible and proactive.\" He proposes that, in addition to widespread education about the real causes of misfortune, \"There should be heavy penalties including suspension and summary dismissal for the head of any village, or district where an alleged witch is attacked or killed.\""

With panelist Eran Segev (then-President, Australian Skeptics) and moderator Brian Thompson (Outreach Director, JREF), Igwe discussed his efforts in human rights advocacy and the deleterious effects of superstition and witchcraft accusation in Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi.In October 2012, Igwe was appointed as a Research Fellow of the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF), a skeptical nonprofit organization founded by magician and skeptic James Randi. Randi said of the appointment, \"We at the JREF are proud to work with Mr. Leo Igwe in fighting deadly misinformation in Africa, and around the world,\" adding that the JREF's mission \"fits in perfectly with Mr. Igwe's very important work.\"In 2013, Igwe presented a speech at the London Black Atheists meeting entitled 'Breaking The Taboo of Atheism in Black Communities', in which he said \"God has not turned up!

Here, he spoke on the topics of science and religion. He attended a panel discussion with Petr Jan Vin\u0161, a priest from the Old Catholic Church, who spoke about bringing more critical thinking to religion. Igwe was \"sternly polite with his comments about not talking down to religious people and embracing science.\"In a 2017 Ted Talk on humanism, Igwe shared how the example of his parents' hard work inspired him to adopt a philosophy that emphasizes human agency in his approach to challenges like poverty, disease, and superstition. \"In some cases, religion drives many Africans to extraordinary length: to attack other human beings, to commit ritual killing, targeting those living with albinism, those with a humpback, and as I recently learned, those with a bald head. In Africa, superstition is widespread, with so many people believing in witchcraft, something that has no basis in reason or in science. Yet alleged witches, usually women, children and elderly persons are still routinely attacked, banished and killed. And I've made it part of my life's mission to end witchcraft accusation and witch persecution in Africa.\""

He was born into a family of musicians and studied cello with Giovanni Perriera and composition with his father, Eliodoro Sollima, at the Conservatorio di Palermo, where he graduated with highest honors. He later studied with Antonio Janigro and Milko Kelemen at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart and at the Universit\u00e4t Mozarteum Salzburg.\nAs a composer, Sollima's influences are wide ranging, taking in jazz and rock, as well as various ethnic traditions from the Mediterranean area. Sollima's music is influenced by minimalism, with his compositions often featuring modal melodies and repetitive structures. Because his works are characterized by a more diverse and eclectic approach to material than the early American minimalist composers, the American critic Kyle Gann has called Sollima a postminimalist composer.Sollima has collaborated with the American poet and musician Patti Smith, appearing on her records and performing with her in concert. He also collaborates with the Silk Road Project."

Heavily influenced by the politics and artist in Mexico, he showcased his works in Brazil, United States, Spain, France, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland. In Mexico his works were in the Palace of Fine Arts and Museum of Modern Art, and the Carrillo Gil and Rufino Tamayo museums. Gironella also illustrated the book Terra Nostra by Carlos Fuentes. In 1960 he won the first prize of the Paris Biennial for Young Painters and the first prize of the Sixth Biennial of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Several of his later paintings were nudes, including several with either topless or fully naked women on beds either holding a classical guitar or one shown in the background such as Sanda as Carmen (1985).Gironella, also depicted American singer Madonna in his last years which he considered than more than pop, she is a surrealist. According to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Monterrey, his Madonna series artworks started in 1991. Gironella has left behind a legacy with his artworks and his only known son, Emiliano Garcia, has continued to share his father's works. specifically his father's \"Las Meninas\" series."

Gironella was often known for taking a liberal approach to both his artwork and his personal life, often being described as stern and reclusive. He spent much of his time at his home in Vallo Bravo near Mexico City, Mexico, and donated his artworks to causes he believed in."

Passionate about poetry and literature, Gironella wrote his first and only novel, Tiburcio Esquila. His writing career was short lived, however, after failing to find a publisher. Moving on from this, Gironella began his journey to becoming a well renowned painter. Having attended school for literature and not painting, Gironella received no formal training and was completely self-taught throughout his career. Despite his failure to find publishing for his book, Gironella continued to incorporate his love for writing through founding the political newspaper, La Jornada, in 1984 where he donated numerous artworks."

Although popular artwork of the time consisted of heavy political agendas like those found in the Mexican Muralism Movement, Gironella did not participate in such agendas. On the contrary, Gironella rejected all art forms that intertwined with politics and became heavily influenced by surrealism and baroque portraiture. Shortly after discovering his painting style, Gironella was instrumental in the founding of the avant-garde art gallery, Galer\u00eda Prisse, along with fellow Mexican artist Vlady Kibalchich Rusakov and H\u00e9ctor Xavier. Galer\u00eda Prisse was a major factor in disturbing the political artworks of the time but this did not prevent Gironella from receiving criticism nor the questioning of his style. Gironella's artwork continues to be shared by his son, Emiliano Gironella, and was showcased in the plastic \"Forgetting Vel\u00e1zquez. The Meninas\" exhibition in Barcelona alongside his favorite artists Picasso, Vel\u00e1zquez, and Goya in 2008."

        "content": "Gironella was inspired by popular Surrealist artists in Mexico as well as many controversial artists of the Mexican Muralism movement such as David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera. Although surrealism differs drastically from the politically driven muralist movement, Gironella found that both distinct art forms resonated with his need to push creative boundaries.\nEven though he was a supporter and advocate of more liberal political views, Gironella's impressions of the Mexican Muralism movement led him to believe that art should not be political, rather, it should be representative of one's subconscious mind. By rejecting the politically influenced artistic styles, Gironella found himself captivated by the avant-garde art movement surrealism. Surrealism sought to create art that was representational of the capabilities of the unconscious mind, a polar opposite of the Mexican Muralism Movement. Gironella is said to contribute this fascination with the colorful avant-garde style to deeply rooted memories in his childhood. Recounting that some of his earliest memories being of himself assembling alters with chocolate rappers, vibrant tins, and bottles from the family owed grocery store. This specific inspiration is said to derive from his love of Leonora Carrington's surrealism that was introduced to the new world in the 1940s, as well as his friendship with the film maker Luis Bu\u00f1uel.\nHaving immersed himself in surrealism, Gironella's artwork caught the attention of the popular French Surrealist artist Andre Breton. During Gironella's first solo exhibition in Paris in 1961, Breton was described to have been enthralled by the artwork, claiming that Gironella's passion and work were proof that surrealism was still alive and strong within the art community. It is important to note, however, that Gironella did not perceive himself solely as a surrealist artist, claiming that he was just as much a baroque artist and labels were not necessary. The fact that not even Gironella himself could pinpoint his exact style could perhaps be said to have been a precursor to future art admirers also not being able to categorize his work. Nonetheless, Gironella's artwork has left a lasting impression on many artist and admirers around the world"

Gironella referred to this combination of artistic approaches as \"mestizo,\" a mix between Indigenous and European influences. Primarily focused on Spanish Baroque paintings of the 16th and 17th century, specifically court portraiture, many artists of his time found it difficult to categorize Gironella as a Mexican Surrealist, instead being dismissed as an \"international artist\" by the Mexican art historian Ida Rodr\u00edguez Prampolini. It is important to note that surrealism is not the only artistic style that Gironella used, Baroque style also influenced him in which led him to use renowned artistic works of Spaniard origin and rework them into his own style while incorporating surrealism."

This unique art is said to be Gironella's version of artistically piecing together Mexico's past and present with the colonization of Mexico by the Spaniard monarchy. The colonial approach is said to have been influenced by his favorite artist such as Francisco Goya, El Greco, and Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, all of whom were alive during the colonization of Mexico. Despite the fact that many did not perceive Gironella as an authentic Mexican artist, Gironella frequently pushed back on this perspective because to deny the effect of Spaniard and European influences on Mexico would be to disembody Mexico's cultural identity entirely."

They also produced santonin, an antiparasitic, later expanding production to other chemicals.Pfizer's partner and cousin, Charles F. Erhart, also wed his sister, Frances, becoming his brother-in-law. When Erhart died, in 1891, their partnership agreement came into effect, which stipulated that the surviving partner could buy the other's share of the company for half of its inventory value. Pfizer promptly exercised this option, paying his partner's heirs $119,350 for Erhart's half of the business. He remained as the head of the company for 51 years, until 1900, when it was incorporated. Charles Pfizer Jr. then became the company's first president; he was later succeeded by his brother, Emile."

They won the 2014 Red Deer Curling Classic on the World Curling Tour, which was P\u00e4tz's first tour win. P\u00e4tz also qualified for the playoffs at the 2014 Masters Grand Slam of Curling event. In the second half of the season, they won the International Bernese Ladies Cup and the Swiss Women's Curling Championship, qualifying them for the 2015 World Women's Curling Championship. Switzerland finished the round robin in first place with a 10\u20131 record. A victory over Canada's Jennifer Jones sent them to the final, where they once again faced Jones. Up 4\u20133 in the tenth end, P\u00e4tz drew to the button for the win, winning the World Championship gold medal and title.The following season, Team P\u00e4tz won the right to represent Switzerland at the 2015 European Curling Championships, but they did not qualify for the playoffs, finishing 4\u20135. They also did not win any tour events during the season. They could not defend their title as world champions, as they lost in the Swiss championship to 2014 world champions Binia Feltscher. The 2016\u201317 season was more successful for the Swiss rink. They won the 2017 International Bernese Ladies Cup and made the final of the Glynhill Ladies International. They also won the Swiss championship and represented Switzerland at the 2017 World Women's Curling Championship. Despite starting 4\u20130, the team lost six of their last seven games, ultimately not qualifying for the playoffs.

The team competed against the other top Swiss teams, Silvana Tirinzoni and Binia Feltscher, at the 2017 Swiss Olympic Curling Trials to choose the Swiss representative at the 2018 Winter Olympics. The event was ultimately won by the Tirinzoni rink, which finished 6\u20130. After failing to win the Swiss championship in February, the P\u00e4tz team disbanded.Heading into the 2018\u201319 curling season, P\u00e4tz joined forces with Silvana Tirinzoni, who would skip the team, but P\u00e4tz would throw fourth rocks, with Esther Neuenschwander at second and Melanie Barbezat throwing lead rocks. The team reached the final in the first Grand Slam of the season, the Elite 10. They represented Switzerland at the 2018 European Curling Championships, claiming the silver medal. They were unbeaten in the round robin, winning nine games, defeated Germany 6\u20134 in the semi-final, and lost 5\u20134 to Sweden's Anna Hasselborg in the final. Having won the 2019 Swiss National Championships, the team represented Switzerland at the 2019 World Women's Curling Championship in Silkeborg, Denmark. The team went 2\u20133 in their first five games, then won six games in a row to secure their playoff spot. They went on to finish the round robin with an 8\u20134 record and in fourth place in the standings. They defeated China in the qualification game and South Korea in the semi-final to set up a repeat of the European Championship final against Hasselborg and Sweden. The result was reversed, with P\u00e4tz making a draw to the four-foot in the extra end for an 8\u20137 win to become the 2019 world champions. The team capped off their year by winning their first Grand Slam title together at the Champions Cup and reaching the final of the inaugural Curling World Cup.\nAt the start of the 2019\u201320 season, Team Tirinzoni were runners-up at the 2019 Cameron's Brewing Oakville Fall Classic. They also qualified for the playoffs at their next three events, the 2019 Stu Sells Oakville Tankard, the 2019 AMJ Campbell Shorty Jenkins Classic and the 2019 WCT Uiseong International Curling Cup. The next week, they won the Women's Masters Basel. They represented Switzerland at the 2019 European Curling Championships, where they finished the round robin in first place with an 8\u20131 record. However, they would not make the final, as they lost to Scotland's Eve Muirhead in the semifinal. They rebounded in the bronze medal game, defeating Alina Kovaleva of Russia. The team would not get to defend their title as world champions, losing the final of the 2020 Swiss Women's Curling Championship to the young Elena Stern rink. The Swiss championship would be the team's last event of the season, as both the Players' Championship and the Champions Cup Grand Slam events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Team Tirinzoni began the 2020\u201321 season by making the final of the 2020 Schweizer Cup, where they once again lost to the Stern rink. Three weeks later, the team was invited to play in the Adelboden International men's World Curling Tour event, as a last-minute addition. After dropping their first game to Yannick Schwaller, they went on a four-game winning streak against the men's field before losing to Olympic bronze medallist Peter de Cruz in the semifinal. In January 2021, P\u00e4tz competed at the 2021 Swiss Mixed Doubles Curling Championship with her boyfriend Sven Michel. The pair finished the round robin with a 5\u20132 record, in second place. They then defeated teammate Silvana Tirinzoni and Beno\u00eet Schwarz in the semifinal before losing the best-of-three final to Briar H\u00fcrlimann and Yannick Schwaller. Two weeks later, P\u00e4tz won her fourth national championship at the 2021 Swiss Women's Curling Championship. This put her team in a playoff against 2020 Champions Team Stern for the right to represent Switzerland at the 2021 World Women's Curling Championship, as the 2020 Worlds were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Team Tirinzoni beat Stern in the playoff, and represented Switzerland at the World Championship, which was played in a bio-secure bubble in Calgary, Canada due to the pandemic. There, they finished with a 12\u20131 round robin record, including scoring a rare eight-ender against Denmark, the first time an eight-ender has ever been scored at a World Championship. In the playoffs, the team defeated the United States in the semifinal, and then Alina Kovaleva representing RCF (Russia) in the final to win the gold medal, successfully defending their 2019 championship. While also in the Calgary bubble, Team Tirinzoni played in two Grand Slam events, making the final at the 2021 Champions Cup and the semifinals at the 2021 Players' Championship.Team Tirinzoni had a slow start to the 2021\u201322 season, not reaching any finals in their first five tour events. At the first two Slams, the 2021 Masters and the 2021 National, they went undefeated until losses in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively. At the 2021 European Curling Championships, the team failed to reach the playoffs for the first time, finishing in fifth with a 6\u20133 record. The next event the team played in was the 2022 Winter Olympics, where they found their footing for the first time during the season. They finished in first place after the preliminary round with an 8\u20131 round robin record. This earned them the top seed in the playoff round. They then, however, lost the semifinal to Japan's Satsuki Fujisawa and the bronze medal game to Sweden's Anna Hasselborg, placing fourth. Immediately after the Olympics, the team entered the Swiss Women's Curling Championship where they were once again able to defend their title, earning the right to represent Switzerland at the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship. At the championship, Team Tirinzoni dominated the competition, finishing the round robin with an unblemished 12\u20130 record. They then beat Sweden's Hasselborg in the semifinal to qualify once again for the world championship final where they would face South Korea's Kim Eun-jung. Switzerland took a three-point lead early, but Korea was able to tie the match later on. In the end, P\u00e4tz executed an open hit to win the match 7\u20136 and repeat for a third time as world women's curling champions. On April 25, the team announced that they would be splitting up at the end of the season, with front end Esther Neuenschwander and Melanie Barbezat stepping away from competitive curling. Team Tirinzoni ended their four-year run together with the final two Slam events of the season, the 2022 Players' Championship and the 2022 Champions Cup, where they had quarterfinal and semifinal finishes respectively. On May 12, P\u00e4tz and Tirinzoni announced that they would be staying together and adding Carole Howald and Briar Schwaller-H\u00fcrlimann to their team for the 2022\u201323 season. Also during the 2021\u201322 season, P\u00e4tz competed in the 2022 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship with boyfriend Sven Michel. The pair went 7\u20132 through the round robin and won a tight semifinal over Norway to reach the gold medal match. There, they fell 9\u20137 to Eve Muirhead and Bobby Lammie of Scotland, earning the silver medal.The new Tirinzoni rink found immediate success on tour, going undefeated in their first event to win the Summer Series. The following week, they lost to Team Clancy Grandy in the final of the 2022 Martensville International. The team next competed in the 2022 Women's Masters Basel where they lost in the semifinal to Raphaela Keiser. They bounced back immediately the following week at the 2022 Stu Sells Toronto Tankard, again going undefeated to claim their second event title of the season. Team Tirinzoni continued their strong play into the first Slam event of the season, the 2022 National. After an undefeated round robin record, the team beat Jennifer Jones 7\u20133 in the quarterfinals, Kaitlyn Lawes 7\u20135 in the semifinals, and Kerri Einarson 7\u20133 in the championship game to win their third tour event and P\u00e4tz's second Grand Slam title. The team was back on the ice the following week at the 2022 Western Showdown where after dropping their first game, they won seven straight to claim another title. Team Tirinzoni's event streak came to an end at the 2022 Tour Challenge where after a 4\u20130 round robin record, they lost 9\u20132 in the quarterfinals to Isabella Wran\u00e5. Next for the team was the 2022 European Curling Championships where they finished third in the round robin with a 6\u20133 record. They then beat Italy's Stefania Constantini in the semifinal before dropping the championship game 8\u20134 to Denmark's Madeleine Dupont. After much success in the first half of the season, the team missed the playoffs at their next two events, the 2022 Masters and the 2023 Canadian Open. They rebounded, however, at the 2023 International Bernese Ladies Cup, going a perfect 8\u20130 to win the event. At the 2023 Swiss Women's Curling Championship, the team defended their title for a third year in a row, winning 6\u20134 over Corrie H\u00fcrlimann in the championship game. This qualified Team Tirinzoni for the 2023 World Women's Curling Championship where they continued their winning streak at the World Championship, again going 12\u20130 through the round robin. They then topped Sweden's Anna Hasselborg 8\u20134 to qualify for the final against Norway's Marianne R\u00f8rvik. Despite not having their best game, the Swiss team stole two in the tenth end to win the game 6\u20133 and secure their fourth consecutive World Championship title. With the win, the team also took the record for the most consecutive victories at the Women's World Championship, now at 36 games. Team Tirinzoni ended their season at the final two Slams of the season, the 2023 Players' Championship and the 2023 Champions Cup. At the Players', the team lost two straight before going on a six-game winning streak to qualify for the final. There, they lost 6\u20135 to Isabella Wran\u00e5. Prior to the Champions Cup, the team's last event of the season, they announced they had removed Briar Schwaller-H\u00fcrlimann from the team for \"team harmony\" reasons. The team made the decision while Schwaller-H\u00fcrlimann was playing in the 2023 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship, but did not tell her until she travelled to Canada to play in the Champions Cup. Schwaller-H\u00fcrlimann was replaced by Rachel Erickson at the tournament, where they missed the playoffs with a 1\u20134 record. Days later, it was announced that Selina Witschonke was replacing Schwaller-H\u00fcrlimann on the team at second with Carole Howald shifting to lead."

Clark then drank some of her blood and stuffed her in a duffel bag. He buried her in a park 12 miles away.On October 18, 1992, he killed 23-year-old Laura Houghteling in Bethesda, Maryland. Clark was working as a gardener for Laura's mother Penny when she accused Clark of stealing tools from her backyard shed. Clark entered the house through the back door and stabbed Laura to death in her bedroom with a kitchen knife and suffocated her with a pillow. He carried her body in a bedsheet through a wooded area and buried her a half-mile away. He left behind a pillow with his fingerprint as he moved the body. He later returned and dressed up in a wig and women's clothes and left through the front door to make people think Laura left the house alive to buy time to clean the scene. Police soon discovered the bloody pillow and linked the print on it to Clark. Clark confessed and led police to Laura's body eight months after the murder. Police began looking at him for Dorr's murder after discovering he lived two houses down from Dorr's father at the time she disappeared. Police later tested his brother's old house for blood and found Dorr's blood in the wooden floorboards of an upstairs bedroom. Clark later led police to her body in January 2000."

Born into a wealthy, noble family, Stasov became a prominent figure in mid-19th-century Russian culture. He discovered a large number of its greatest talents, inspired many of their works and fought their battles in numerous articles and letters to the press. As such, he carried on a lifelong debate with Russian novelist and playwright Ivan Turgenev, who considered Stasov \"our great all-Russian critic.\" He wanted Russian art to liberate itself from what he saw as Europe's hold.  By copying the west, he felt, Russian artists could be, at best, second-rate.  However, by borrowing from their own native traditions, they might create a truly national art that could match Europe's with its high artistic standards and originality. By \"national\" Stasov meant an art that would not only portray people's lives but also be meaningful to them and show them how to live."

In 1667 he moved to Venice, where he made a series of ten aquatints from works by Giuseppe Diamantini (1621\u20131705). In 1675 he painted the Martyrdom of St. Erasmus. The painting was exhibited at Palazzo Molin, and is currently located in the National Gallery of Spinola in Genoa. In 1690 he was invited to Vienna by the Emperor Leopold I.\n\nIn 1696 he returned to Valsolda where he frescoed what is considered his masterwork: the nave of the parish church of San Martino. The work, completed the year of the birth of Tiepolo, who would master the art of the luminous fresco, astounds with the use of bright colors and swirling sotto in su perspective as a fresco technique. Michela Catalano, in an entry about Pagani on the Lombardia Beni Culturali website, states:The result is an extraordinary invention of illusionistic perspective, consisting of two quadratura domes connected by transverse arches, framing a complex composition, in which different iconographic themes, in turn, connect the (painted narratives) of lives of the saints to their respective side chapels. (In the center of the second dome) is depicted the Assumption of the Virgin... (To its side, is depicted) .. the Preaching of (John) the Baptist; on the opposite side of the vault, and above the chapel dedicated to Saint Apollonia, Catherine and Lucy, (the space is) decorated with frescoes the death sentence of the three martyrs, carried to glory by angels on the ceiling of the first span. The fantastic, dizzying rush of the vault ... is a veritable compendium of the experiences drawn from the figurative painters in Venice and Central Europe, from research on chiaroscuro and naturalistic styles of the Venetian tenebrosi artists, and impacted by the Baroque of Rubens, a reflection on models of Michelangelo, Tintoretto and other mannerists, supplemented by a precocious adoption of the illusionistic perspective methods of Andrea Pozzo.\nPagani died in Milan on 5 May 1716. His former house in Valsolda has been converted in a museum dedicated to his work in 2004."

        "content": "Klementieff was born in Quebec City, Canada, to a Korean mother, Yu Ri Park, and Russian-French father Alexis Klementieff, who was working there as a consul with the government of France. Her grandfather was Russian painter Eugene Klementieff.Her parents chose the name \"Pom\" because it is similar in pronunciation to the Korean words for both \"spring\" (\ubd04) and \"tiger\" (\ubc94).She is a French citizen and does not have Canadian citizenship because jus soli does not apply to children of diplomats. Klementieff lived in Canada for one year before her family began traveling extensively due to her father's job. They lived in Japan and Ivory Coast before settling in France.\nKlementieff's father died of cancer when she was five, and her mother had schizophrenia and was unable to care for children, so Klementieff was raised by her paternal uncle and aunt. Her uncle, whom she described as \"like [her] second father\", died on her 18th birthday, and her older brother Namou died by suicide seven years later, on her 25th birthday. Klementieff briefly studied law in an undergraduate capacity after her uncle's death to appease her aunt, but did not find it appealing. She also worked as a waitress and saleswoman in France. She started acting at age 19 at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris. A few months into her education, she won a theater competition and two years of free classes with the school's top teachers."

He studied in the seminary of his native City, and showed remarkable aptitude for mathematics and chemistry. When scarcely nineteen years old he was appointed as assayer of the royal mint of Santiago, but resigned the next year, and devoted himself entirely to the cultivation of a farm near Santiago, inherited from his father.\nThere his labors tended more to the improvement of the condition of the laboring classes than to his own pecuniary interest. He improved the yield of some of the poorest lands by his knowledge of chemistry, introduced modern agricultural implements, and, by giving his laborers better than the accustomed wages and caring for their moral and material welfare, soon assembled a colony of well to do and contented people. He also introduced looms, which, although imperfect, served to weave from native wool the coarse cloth worn by the peasantry.\nFrom the first years of his country life he agitated the project of a canal to water the barren plain surrounding Santiago, which had been begun some time before, but was abandoned. The Spanish government approved the plan, and in 1802 made Eyzaguirre director. He pushed the work with energy until it was interrupted by the revolution of 1810, and notwithstanding he sympathized with the patriotic cause, he abstained from any participation.\nHis prestige as an honorable and impartial man was so great that, even when his brothers were exiled, he suffered no persecution from the Spanish authorities, and was enabled to alleviate the sufferings of his compatriots. When the independence of Chile was finally established in 1817, he resumed his favorite work, and in 1820, amid great festivities, the canal of Maipo was opened. This, with many smaller lateral canals, soon converted the arid plain into a fertile garden. It was placed by the government under the administration of a board, of which Eyzaguirre was appointed president.In 1823 he was commissioned to reorganize the charitable institutions, and undertook the task of building a home for wayfarers and needy persons. Within a few years he had collected the necessary means, and a new and commodious building was erected.\nIn 1835 he was appointed first governor of the department of Victoria, the capital of which he had founded and spent a good part of his fortune in improving. He established the agricultural society in 1838, and was elected its president. He was several times deputy to the National congress, where he soon became noted for his honesty.\nIn 1845 he attempted to establish a socialistic colony in the country, where all should share the labor and produce, but soon dissensions broke out, and the project failed. A few years later he undertook to establish a large cloth factory, with the object of improving the condition of the poor and giving occupation to women and children. In this enterprise he invested the greater part of his fortune, but before the factory was finished he died. The Maipo canal board erected a statue to his memory."

        "content": "Prior to his professional baseball career, Ferguson played baseball but also basketball at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, CA. In fact, he played in the West Regional Final in March 1967, where Pacific fell to eventual National champion UCLA, led by sophomore Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\nFerguson reached the majors in 1970 with the Los Angeles Dodgers, becoming their everyday catcher in 1973. He set a major league record for catchers by committing only three errors, leading the National League catchers in fielding percentage (.996) and double plays (17), while hitting .263 with a .369 on-base percentage. He also reached career-highs in games played (136), home runs (25), RBI (88), runs (84), doubles (26) and walks (87).\nWhen Steve Yeager became a regular behind the plate midseason in 1973, Ferguson split his catching duties with playing right field against left-handed pitchers.  He soon became known for having one of the strongest throwing arms of any outfielder in the major leagues. In Game One of the 1974 World Series he stepped in front of center fielder Jimmy Wynn in deep right-center field to catch Reggie Jackson's high fly ball and proceeded to throw a 300-foot strike to catcher Yeager who tagged out Sal Bando in a collision at home plate to end the top of the eighth inning. He explained after the game that Wynn had been bothered by a shoulder problem in his throwing arm all season long and added, \"There was never any worry about a collision between us. We talked about it earlier in the game that if such a flyball like that was hit with a guy on third base that if I could get there I'd take it. I'd make the throw. I didn't realize how good the throw was because my sunglasses slipped over my eyes.\" In Game Two, Ferguson hit a two-run homer off Vida Blue to provide the only Dodgers' victory in the Series. He enjoyed another fine season in 1977 with Houston, catching 122 games and hitting 16 home runs with 61 RBI and a .379 OBP. Reacquired by the Dodgers in the 1978 midseason, he helped his team reach the 1978 World Series.\nAfter retiring, he coached at the major league level with the Texas Rangers (1986\u201387), working under former Dodger teammate Bobby Valentine, and the Dodgers (1988\u201394). He also managed in the Dodgers, Baltimore Orioles and San Diego Padres minor league systems. He managed the Camden Riversharks Atlantic League baseball team in New Jersey for 3 seasons from 2007 - 2009.\nIn a 14-season career, Ferguson was a power-hitter who was very efficient at getting on base. Although he only had a .240 batting average, he had a .358 on-base percentage to go along with 122 home runs and 445 RBI in 1013 games. In 13 postseason games he batted .200, but had an excellent .378 on-base percentage to go along with 1 HR and 4 RBI's."

        "content": "He was born in Mantua, the third son of Francesco II Gonzaga and Isabella d'Este. At the age of sixteen, he was sent to the court of Spain as a page to the future emperor Charles V, to whom Ferrante remained faithful for his whole life. In 1527 he took part in the Sack of Rome and attended Charles' triumphant coronation at Bologna in 1530: at the death of Charles of Bourbon (1527) he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Imperial army in Italy. He became a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1531.\nHe defended Naples from the assault of the French troops under Odet of Foix, Viscount of Lautrec, and obtained the surrender of the Republic of Florence. For this feat Pope Clement VII, a member of the Medici who had been ousted from that city, named him papal governor of Benevento. Again for Charles V, he fought against the Turks at Tunis in 1535 and Algiers in 1541 with a contingent of 3,000 cavalry. He served Charles as Viceroy of Sicily (1535\u20131546), and Forte Gonzaga was named in his honour. He accompanied the Emperor to Germany in 1543 and fought the resolute campaign that enforced the Treaty of Cr\u00e9py. He then served as Governor of the Duchy of Milan (1546\u20131554), in which role he fought in the War of Parma.\nIn 1529 Ferrante married Isabella di Capua, who brought him the fiefdoms of Molfetta and Giovinazzo and thanks to this marriage he became one of the major feudal lords of the Kingdom of Naples. In 1539 he bought the countship of Guastalla, on the left bank of the Po for 22,280 golden scudi from Countess Ludovica Torelli; this guaranteed him the rank of sovereign prince of the Holy Roman Empire, because the County of Guastalla enjoyed very broad autonomy and practically almost independence, despite its limited size. This acquisition was in part also a strategic purchase, for Guastalla lies near Ferrara, which Charles wished to take from the Este.Ferrante's villa near Milan, La Gualtiera, is now known as La Simonetta. Ferrante rebuilt it in the 1550s, commissioning the services of the Tuscan architect Domenico Giuntallodi of Prato. Ferrante was a patron and protector of the sculptor and medallist Leone Leoni, who executed a bronze medal for him about 1555, with a reverse that depicts Hercules with upraised club besting the Nemean Lion and the legend TV NE CEDE MALIS, \"You do not yield to evil\", alluding to his acquittal after indictment for misappropriation of funds and corruption. His son Cesare commissioned from Leone a more public monument, a bronze Triumph of Ferrante Gonzaga over Envy, (1564), which stands in Piazza Roma, Guastalla. Like all the Gonzaga, Ferrante was a patron of tapestry-makers: a series of tapestries named Fructus Belli (\"the Fruits of War\") was woven for him in Brussels by Jan Baudoyn in 1544, and a lighter series of Putti.He died in Brussels from a fall from a horse and battle fatigue received at the Battle of St. Quentin. He was buried in the sacristy of the Mantua Cathedral.Ferrante was succeeded in Guastalla by his son Cesare.\nHe was the ambassador to Henry VIII of England in 1543."

His older brother, Isaac Robert, also followed in the family business as a caricaturist and illustrator.\nCruikshank's early work was caricature; but in 1823, at the age of 31, he started to focus on book illustration. He illustrated the first, 1823 English translation (by Edgar Taylor and David Jardine) of Grimms' Fairy Tales, published in two volumes as German Popular Stories.On 16 October 1827, he married Mary Ann Walker (1807\u20131849). Two years after her death, on 7 March 1851, he married Eliza Widdison.

        "content": "Cruikshank's early career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications. He achieved early success collaborating with William Hone in his political satire The Political House That Jack Built (1819). In the same year he produced the now-infamous anti-abolitionist piece The New Union Club. It satirised a dinner party organised by abolitionists with black guests. While this piece was praised as \"the finest of G.C.'s caricatures\" during the 19th century, it is now viewed as one of the most racist prints of its era. His 1819 print, The Belle Alliance, or the Female Reformers of Blackburn!!!, criticised the role of women in the reform movement, portraying them as unfeminine and grotesque.His first major work was Pierce Egan's Life in London (1821) in which the characters Tom and Jerry, two 'men about town' visit various London locations and taverns to enjoy themselves and carouse. This was followed by The Comic Almanack (1835\u20131853) and Omnibus (1842). Cruikshank gained notoriety with his political prints that attacked the royal family and leading politicians. In 1820 he received a royal bribe of \u00a3100 for a pledge \"not to caricature His Majesty\" (George IV of the United Kingdom) \"in any immoral situation\". His work included a personification of England named John Bull who was developed from about 1790 in conjunction with other British satirical artists such as James Gillray, and Thomas Rowlandson.Cruikshank replaced one of his major influences, James Gillray, as England's most popular satirist. For a generation he delineated Tories, Whigs and Radicals impartially. Satirical material came to him from every public event \u2013 wars abroad, the enemies of Britain (he was highly patriotic), the frolic, among other qualities, such as the weird and terrible, in which he excelled. His hostility to enemies of Britain and a crude racism is evident in his illustrations commissioned to accompany William Maxwell's History of the Irish rebellion in 1798 (1845) where his lurid depictions of incidents in the rebellion were characterised by the simian-like portrayal of Irish rebels.  Among the other racially engaged works of Cruikshank there were caricatures about the \"legal barbarities\" of the Chinese, the subject given by his friend, Dr. W. Gourley, a participant in the ideological battle around the Arrow War, 1856\u201360."

He also illustrated Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi (1838), which Dickens edited under his regular nom de plume, \"Boz\". Cruikshank even acted in Dickens's amateur theatrical company.\nOn 30 December 1871, Cruikshank published a letter in The Times which claimed credit for much of the plot of Oliver Twist. The letter launched a fierce controversy around who created the work. Cruikshank was not the first Dickens illustrator to make such a claim. Robert Seymour who illustrated the Pickwick Papers suggested that the idea for that novel was originally his; however, in his preface to the 1867 edition, Dickens strenuously denied any specific input.\nThe friendship between Cruikshank and Dickens soured further when Cruikshank became a fanatical teetotaler in opposition to Dickens's views of moderation.\nIn Somerset Maugham's short story \"Miss King\", Cruickshank's influence is referenced:\n\nShe wore a large white cotton nightcap (on entering Ashenden has noticed the brown wig on a stand on the dressing-table) tied under the chin and a white voluminous nightdress that came high up in the neck. Nightcap and nightdress belonged to a past age and reminded you of Cruickshank's illustrations to the novels of Charles Dickens."

Formerly a heavy drinker, he now supported, lectured to, and supplied illustrations for the National Temperance Society and the Total Abstinence Society, among others. The best known of these are The Bottle, 8 plates (1847), with its sequel, The Drunkard's Children, 8 plates (1848), with the ambitious work, The Worship of Bacchus, published by subscription after the artist's oil painting, now in the Tate Gallery, London. For his efforts he was made vice president of the National Temperance League in 1856.\nWhen the invasion scare of 1859 led to the creation of the Volunteer Movement, Cruikshank was one of those who organised Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs). At first his unit was the 24th Surrey RVC, which recruited from working men who were total abstainers and was named 'Havelock's Own' in honour of Major-General Sir Henry Havelock, a hero of the Indian Mutiny and pioneer of Temperance Clubs in the army.\nHowever, Cruikshank received little encouragement from the Lord-Lieutenant of Surrey, and was rebuked for crossing into Kent to recruit. Disgusted, he disbanded his unit in 1862 and began anew in Middlesex, organising the 48th Middlesex RVC (Havelock's Temperance Volunteers). The unit ran into financial difficulties and when Cruikshank was forced to retire due to age, he was replaced as commanding officer by Lt-Col Cuthbert Vickers, a wealthy shipowner.  However, the Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette of 3 September 1868 reported that Cruikshank had resigned as Lieutenant-Colonel of the Volunteers \"in consequence, it is said, of the reinstatement in the service of certain officers of his corps who some time since had a difference with their Lieutenant-Colonel and were cashiered\".\nThe 48th Middlesex merged with the 2nd City of London RVC, also a working-men's unit, composed mainly of printers from the Fleet Street area, and the combined unit had a long history as the City of London Rifles."

        "content": "Elizabeth Ann Eckford (born October 4, 1941) is an American civil rights activist and one of the Little Rock Nine, a group of African American students who, in 1957, were the first black students ever to attend classes at the previously all-white Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. The integration came as a result of the 1954 United States Supreme Court ruling Brown v. Board of Education. Eckford's public ordeal was captured by press photographers on the morning of September 4, 1957, after she was prevented from entering the school by the Arkansas National Guard. A dramatic snapshot by Will Counts of the Arkansas Democrat showed the young girl being followed and threatened by an angry white mob; this and other photos of the day's startling events were circulated around the US and the world by the press.Counts's image was the unanimous selection by the Pulitzer jury for a 1958 Pulitzer Prize, but since the story had earned then-rival  Arkansas Gazette two other Pulitzer Prizes already, the Pulitzer board awarded the prize to another photographer for a pleasant photograph of a two-year-old boy in Washington, D.C. A different photo taken by Counts of Alex Wilson, a black reporter for the Memphis Tri-State Defender being beaten by the angry mob in Little Rock the same day, was chosen as the \"News Picture of the Year\" for 1957 by the National Press Photographers Association. This image by Counts prompted President Dwight D. Eisenhower to send federal troops to Little Rock.Eckford only spent one year at Little Rock Central High where she and the other black students were tormented throughout. In the years since, she has struggled through life, and twice attempted suicide. She was subsequently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder."

        "content": "On September 4, 1957, Eckford and eight other African American students (known as the Little Rock Nine) made an unsuccessful attempt to enter Little Rock Central High School, which had been segregated. An angry mob of about 400 surrounded the school that day, with the complicity of the Arkansas National Guard.Fifteen-year-old Eckford tried to enter the school, while soldiers of the National Guard, under orders from Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus, stepped in her way to prevent her from entering. Eventually, she gave up and tried to flee to a bus stop through the mob of segregationists who surrounded and threatened to lynch her. Once Eckford got to the bus stop, she couldn't stop crying. A reporter, Benjamin Fine, having in mind his own 15-year-old daughter, sat down next to Eckford. He tried to comfort her and told her, \"don't let them see you cry.\" Soon, she was also protected by a white woman named Grace Lorch who escorted her onto a city bus.The original plan was to have the nine children arrive together, but when the meeting place was changed the night before, the Eckford family's lack of a telephone left Elizabeth uninformed of the change. Instructions were given by Daisy Bates, a strong activist for desegregation, for the nine students to wait for her so that they could all walk together to the rear entrance of the school. This last-minute change caused Elizabeth to be the first to take a different route to school, walking up to the front entrance completely alone. Elizabeth Eckford's family was not informed of the meeting and didn't know that the school board asked the parents to accompany her. Also, Eckford rode a public bus alone to the segregated school. That day, Elizabeth wore a starched black-and-white dress, and she covered her face under black sunglasses. Elizabeth also held her school book in her hand. As she walked toward the school, Elizabeth was surrounded by a crowd of armed guards and a mob of people, and she did not see any black faces. The mob included men, women, and teenagers (white students) who opposed integration. The white teenagers chanted \"Two, four, six, eight, we ain't gonna integrate.\" Elizabeth attempted to go into the school through the mob but was denied entrance. Eckford walked to a bus bench at the end of the block. Eckford described her experience:\n\nI stood looking at the school\u2014 it looked so big! Just then the guards let some white students through. The crowd was quiet. I guess they were waiting to see what was going to happen. When I was able to steady my knees, I walked up to the guard who had let the white students in. He didn't move. When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet, and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They glared at me with a mean look and I was very frightened and didn't know what to do. I turned around and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer. Somebody started yelling, \"Drag her over this tree! Let's take care of that nigger!\"\nEven though Elizabeth Eckford would one day be known as a member of the Little Rock Nine, at this point in the school day, she was all alone, making her the first African-American student to integrate a white southern high school.For the next two weeks, the Little Rock Nine stayed home to study instead of going to the Little Rock Central High School. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was reluctant to do anything about the mob or the rioting. Eisenhower summoned Orval Faubus, the Governor of Arkansas to intervene and asked for the withdrawal of all troops from the high school after Elizabeth Eckford's experience attempting to enter the school the first time.On September 23, 1957, the Little Rock Nine approached Central High again, and Elizabeth Eckford along with the other eight students, accompanied by city policemen, were let into the high school through a side door. The reaction from the mob was described as follows:\n\nThe crowd let out a roar of rage. \"They've gone in,\" a man shouted...Once the Little Rock Nine entered the school, they were separated. The mob infiltrated the school, and under threats of death, the nine were taken to the principal's office. One of the nine overheard officials saying \"We may have to let the mob have one of those kids, so's we can distract them long enough to get the others out.\"\nThe Arkansas National Guard, under orders from the governor, and an angry mob of about 400 surrounded the school and prevented them from going in. On September 23, 1957, a mob of about 1000 people surrounded the school again as the students attempted to enter. The following day, President Dwight D. Eisenhower took control of the Arkansas National Guard from the governor and sent the 101st Airborne Division to accompany the students to school for protection. Both federal troops and federalized National Guardsmen were deployed at the school for the entirety of the school year, although they were unable to prevent incidents of violence against the group inside, such as Eckford being thrown down a flight of stairs.All of the city's high schools were closed the following year, so Eckford did not graduate from Central High School. However, she had taken correspondence and night courses garnering enough credits for her high school diploma. In 1958, Eckford and the rest of the Little Rock Nine were awarded the Spingarn Medal by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), as was Ms. Bates."

        "content": "Eckford was accepted by Knox College in Illinois, but chose to return to Little Rock to be near her family. She later attended Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio, where she earned a BA in history. In 2018, Eckford was awarded an honorary doctorate from Knox College.Eckford served in the United States Army for five years, first as a pay clerk, and then as an information specialist. She also wrote for the Fort McClellan (Alabama) and the Fort Benjamin Harrison (Indiana) newspapers. After that, she has worked as a waitress, history teacher, welfare worker, unemployment and employment interviewer, and a military reporter. In 2007, she was working as a probation officer in Little Rock.In 1997, she shared the Father Joseph Biltz Award\u2014presented by the National Conference for Community and Justice\u2014with Hazel Bryan Massery, a then-segregationist student at Central High School who appeared in several of the 1957 photographs screaming at the young Elizabeth. During the reconciliation rally of 1997, the two women made speeches together. But later their friendship broke up, with Eckford reflecting, \"[Hazel] wanted me to be cured and be over it and for this not to go on anymore. She wanted me to be less uncomfortable so that she wouldn't feel responsible.\" In 1999, President Bill Clinton presented the nation's highest civilian award, the Congressional Gold Medal, to the members of the Little Rock Nine.On the morning of January 1, 2003, one of Eckford's two sons, Erin Eckford, age 26, was shot and killed by police in Little Rock. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that the police officers had unsuccessfully tried to disarm him with a beanbag round after he had fired several shots from his rifle. When Eckford pointed his rifle towards them, the police officers shot him. His mother feared that his death was \"suicide by police\". Erin, she said, had suffered from mental illness but had been off his prescribed medication for several years. The newspaper later reported that prosecutors investigating the fatal shooting had decided that the police officers concerned were justified in shooting Eckford.In 2018, 60 years after leaving Little Rock Central High, Eckford told her story in her first autobiography, The Worst First Day: Bullied While Desegregating Little Rock Central High. The book was coauthored with Dr. Eurydice Stanley and Grace Stanley of Pensacola, Florida. Grace was 15 years old when she worked on the project, the same age Eckford was when she desegregated Central High. The Worst First Day tells Eckford's experiences in verse. It features the graphic artwork of Rachel Gibson and the photography of Will Counts. Eckford traveled to New Zealand in 2019 to teach American civil rights history to more than 4,000 students with Dr. Stanley at the request of high school teacher Roydon Agent, author of Public Image, Private Shame.\nOn November 19, 2022, Elizabeth Eckford spoke at the keel-laying ceremony of the attack submarine USS Arkansas (SSN-800) at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia, after she and Ernest Green, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Carlotta Walls LaNier and Thelma Mothershed-Wair etched their initials onto metal plates that were then welded onto the keel. The plates will remain affixed to the submarine throughout its life. Melba Pattillo Beals and Minnijean Brown-Trickey were also named sponsors of the ship, and all members of the Little Rock Nine were honored. Eckford said \u201c(Former Navy) Secretary Ray Mabus asked us to be supporters of the ship and its crew. I signed on to be a foster grandmother...President Eisenhower sent 1,000 paratroopers to Little Rock to disperse a mob, bring order, and they made it possible for us to enter Central High School. From that point, I\u2019ve had very high regard for specially trained forces.\u201d"

His wife, Sadhanatai Amte, explains that he came to be known as Baba not because \"he was regarded as a saint or a holy person, but because his parents addressed him by that name.\"Amte was the eldest of eight children. As the eldest son of a wealthy land owner, he had an idyllic childhood, filled with hunting and sports. By the time he was fourteen, he owned his own gun and hunted bear and deer. When he was old enough to drive, he was given a Singer Sports car with cushions covered with panther skin. Though he was born in a wealthy family he was always aware of the class inequality that prevailed in Indian society. \"There is a certain callousness in families like my family,\" he used to say. \"They put up strong barriers so as to avoid seeing the misery in the outside world and I rebelled against it.\""

        "content": "Trained in law, he developed a successful legal practice in Wardha. He soon became involved in the Indian independence movement and, in 1942, began working as a defense lawyer for Indian leaders imprisoned by the colonial government for their involvement in the Quit India movement. He spent some time at Sevagram, at the ashram started by Mahatma Gandhi and became a follower of Gandhism. He practiced Gandhism by engaging in yarn spinning using a charkha and wearing khadi. When Gandhi got to know that Dr. Amte had defended a girl from the lewd taunts of some British soldiers, Gandhi gave him the name \u2013 Abhay Sadhak (Fearless Seeker of Truth).However one day his encounter with a living corpse and leprosy patient Tulshiram, filled him with fear. Amte, who never feared for anything till that incident and who fought one time with British men to save the honour of an Indian lady and was also challenged by sweepers of Warora to clean the gutters, was quivered in fright on seeing plight of Tulshiram. However, Amte wanted to create a thinking and understanding that leprosy patients can be truly helped only when a society is free of \"Mental Leprosy\"-fear and wrong understanding associated with disease. To dispel this thinking he once injected himself with bacilli from a patient, to prove the ailment was not highly contagious. In those days, people with leprosy suffered a social stigma and Indian society disowned these people. Amte strove to dispel the widespread belief that leprosy was highly contagious; he even allowed bacilli from a leper to be injected into him as part of an experiment aimed at proving that leprosy was not highly contagious. But Baba Amte and his wife used to prioritise the care and treatment and mainstreaming those affected by the dreaded disease of leprosy and lived amongst the affected and ensured that they got exemplary medical care which ended the scourge of the disease for them. For the rehabilitated and cured patients he arranged vocational training and small-scale manufacturing of handicrafts and got things crafted by them. He struggled and tried to remove the stigma and ignorance surrounding the treatment of leprosy as a disease.Amte founded three ashrams for treatment and rehabilitation of leprosy patients, disabled people and people from marginalised sections of general society in Maharashtra. On 15 August 1949, he and his wife Sadhna Amte started a leprosy hospital in Anandvan under a tree. The leprosy patients were provided with medical care and a life of dignity engaged in agriculture and various small and medium industries like handicrafts. In 1973, Amte founded the Lok Biradari Prakalp to work for the Madia Gond tribal people of Gadchiroli District. Baba Amte also involved in other social cause initiatives like, in year 1985 he launched the first Knit India Mission for peace-at 72 years he walked from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, a distance of more than 3000 miles, to inspire unity among Indian people and organised second march three years later travelling over 1800 miles from Assam to Gujarat. He also participated in Narmada Bachao Andolan in year 1990, leaving Anandwan and lived on banks of Narmada for seven years.Amte devoted his life to many other social causes, most notably the Quit India movement and attempting to raise public awareness on the importance of ecological balance, wildlife preservation and the Narmada Bachao Andolan. The Indian Government awarded Baba Amte with a Padma Shri in 1971."

Thereafter he met a compatriot from Tambov, Valery Ledovskikh with whom he founded a gang. The gang initially invited only persons from Tambov region (thus its name, Tambovskaya). Being not yet strong enough to operate independently, the gang merged into the large criminal group Velikolukskaya (from Velikie Luki, Pskov region) and was engaged mostly in commercial racketeering.In 1989 multiple members of Kumarin's gang were convicted for the bloody firefight with another criminal gang, Malyshevskaya. The verdict was rather mild, supposedly because the state prosecutor was severely injured by unknown persons during the investigation. After having completed a short sentence, Kumarin's gang swiftly took over all across the northwestern region of Russia \u2013 Leningrad, Pskov, Novgorod, and Karelia \u2013 challenging the business affairs of his former 'host gang'. A bloody skirmish with the Velikolukskaya gang caused Kumarin to fall into a month-long coma. His right arm had to be amputated at the shoulder and bullets pierced his stomach, chest and lungs. To this day he still has bullet fragments in his heart.During the mid-1990s Kumarin attempted to legalize the criminal earnings of his gang using extensive contacts with the government of the City of St. Petersburg headed by mayor Anatoly Sobchak (1991\u20131996), to whom the current Russian president Vladimir Putin served as assistant. Kumarin was an investor to the Kirishinefteorgsintez (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0444\u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0437) oil refinery and member of the Board of Petersburg Fuel Company (PTK) controlled by Kumarin. PTK became the sole supplier of gasoline to the municipal transport of St. Petersburg.Since the late 1990s a few senior members of Kumarin's structures as well as of its adversaries were killed and a list of investigations of his past criminal affairs was published. In June 2003, the magazine Der Spiegel mentioned that, according to the German ministry of criminal affairs, the German firm St. Petersburg Real Estate Holding Company (German: St. Peterburg Immobilien und Beteiligungs AG) (SPAG) had fallen under suspicion of being involved in a money-laundering scheme through the Cali cocaine cartel with connections to Kumarin. The Russian co-owner of the SPAG's joint venture was the government of St. Petersburg, and Vladimir Putin, then the municipal official, was a member of the board from 1992 to 2000. In April 2004 German police interrogated Kumarin but no indictments were made. It has been suggested that Kumarin maintained good relations with Russian politicians Mikhail Glushenko and Alexander Filatov. Allegedly after refusing to back down from a business deal in favour of a politician close to Vladimir Putin, Kumarin was raided and arrested by 300 special forces officers on August 24, 2007. Prosecutor General Yury Chaika accused him of banditry and organizing a gang. He was also accused of the murder attempt on businessman Sergei Vasiliev, a rival in the oil business. In 2006, two men with automatic rifles sprayed Vasiliev's car with gunfire, wounding him and killing one of his bodyguards.Kumarin sought to clean up his image via donations to charities and the Russian Orthodox Church of which he was a devout follower as well as securing the release of two kidnapped children of Sergey Borodulin, Russian businessman. During this period his fame grew as well; dozens of celebrities and politicians attended his 50th birthday party in 2006. Kumarin was interviewed by Andrey Konstantinov, author of book Bandit Petersburg. Since 2004 Kumarin-Barsukov served as assistant to the St. Petersburg municipal MP, Alexander Nevzorov, well-known Russian journalist, who endorsed Kumarin as a \"perfectly clean person\" and invited Kumarin to play the role of King Louis XIV in his film. During the 1990s, however, Nevzorov covered multiple raids on Kumarin's gang on prime-time TV shows, making the gang notorious among the public.After the 2007\u20132009 investigation Kumarin was sentenced to 14 years in prison plus a fine for the episodes of racketeering, fraud, money laundering and a murder attempt. The verdict was challenged in the European Court of Human Rights and by 2011 his sentence was reduced by 2.5 years. In 2012 another long investigation into Kumarin's affairs started. Kumarin was accused of contracting the killing of Galina Starovoitova. The main witness against Kumarin was Mikhail Glushenko, a.k.a. Misha-Khokhol, who in turn was sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2015 for arranging of the murder of Starovoitova.\nIn March 2019, he was sentenced by the Court of St. Petersburg to 24 years in prison for founding The Tambov Gang."

Under his leadership, Ukraine qualified for a major tournament for the first time as an independent nation, reaching the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. Ukraine reached the quarter-finals of the tournament, losing to eventual champions Italy.

The club finished 9th (from 16) and after the season ended Blokhin was fired from the club. At the end of the season, Blokhin announced that if he knew how things would go in FC Moscow, he would have never signed there. This was because the club released many important players without Blokhin's permission yet still had many high expectations. Others said that the reason Blokhin failed in FC Moscow was that he and the press didn't have a friendly relationship, and because of that the press was constantly attacking Blokhin and that damaged his status among the players.On 21 April 2011, Blokhin was again appointed head coach of the Ukraine national team. He led the team in UEFA Euro 2012 on home soil, beating Sweden but exiting at the group stage after defeats to France and England.\n\nOn 25 September 2012, Dynamo Kyiv signed Blokhin to lead the club for the next four years.

After five years of single-handed sailing, he logged over 100,000 miles at sea and set the record for the fastest solo circumnavigation by an American, with a time of 135 days. In 1992, Plant was preparing to compete in his second Vend\u00e9e Globe and fourth single-handed circumnavigation aboard Coyote, a powerful Open 60 sloop, and was lost at sea while delivering Coyote from New York Harbor to Les Sables-d'Olonne, France for the starting line.Coyote was found 32 days later, turtled, without the 8,400 lb lead bulb that should have been attached to the keel. At the time of his death, Plant was one of only six people to have completed three solo circumnavigations, joining Bertie Reed, Guy Bernardin, Jean-Luc Van Den Heede and Philippe Jeantot. and Jon Sanders.

He spent his childhood in the Minneapolis suburb of Deephaven on the shores of Lake Minnetonka. At the age of 9, Plant began sailing X Boats at Minnetonka Yacht Club, and by the age of 14, aboard Lucky Strike, had twice won the Interlake Regatta, the biggest regatta in the area, in which the top five boats from each of the large lakes in Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin competed at the end of the summer.

The meteorologists suggested to Mike that he simply continue the race. They vowed eternal silence. No one would know. \"Except I would,\" Mike answered. Plant radioed the race committee that he had accepted outside help and that he would continue the race, though disqualified. He unofficially crossed the finish line in seventh place.

        "content": "Wolfgang Hohlbein is among the most successful and prolific German fantasy authors. He has written more than 200 books and sold more than 43 million issues throughout his career.Many of his books are translated and published internationally in various European countries as well as outside of Europe in countries such as South Korea. For many years none of his works had been translated into English, not even the eight Indiana Jones novels he wrote. His only works to be translated into English were his three M\u00e4rchenmond novels, which were published by Tokyopop from 2006 onwards, now titled Magic Moon.Hohlbein's books also have been adapted into other media such as radioplays. His work M\u00e4rchenmond was translated into a theatre play, which has been presented in places like the Westf\u00e4lisches Landestheater or the Theater f\u00fcr Niedersachsen. The German progressive metal band, Vanden Plas, recorded and consecutively released two full-length albums, Chronicles of the Immortals \u2013 Netherworld (Path One) in 2014 and Chronicles of the Immortals \u2013 Netherworld II in 2015, that were adapted from Blutnacht, a theater production based on the author's Die Chronik der Unsterblichen.Throughout the years, various propositions have been made to turn some of his works into film, for example for Das Druidentor or Azrael, but none of these projects were realized.\nIn September 2016 however, Constantin Film announced they will create a feature film based on his book Hagen von Tronje.In 2020 Sony produced a film called Die Wolfgang or The Magic Kids (Three Unlikely Heros) about Vlad the vampire who moves to a new magical town and a special magical school, three of the year 7 children team up together as they all have their own problems - a fairy who is afraid of heights, a werewolf who is allergic to fur, and a vampire who can't stand blood.  They soon discover that the town is controlled by a demon who is after one thing - a magical crystal that has been left by Vlad's mother that could bring back dark magical times if used improperly."

The native of Fayetteville, Arkansas, a right-handed pitcher, appeared in 74 Major League games \u2014 31 for the 1947 Cleveland Indians and 43 for the 1948 St. Louis Browns. He stood 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg).\nStephens attended Washington High School in Los Angeles County, California, and signed with the Detroit Tigers in 1939. The following season he was acquired by the Indians and spent 1940\u20131942 in their farm system, winning 20 of 24 decisions in 1942 for the Class B Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League. He then missed the 1943\u20131945 seasons while serving in the United States Army during World War II. After one more year of minor league seasoning in 1946, Stephens made the 1947 Indians' roster.\nIn his first Major League appearance, as a starting pitcher on May 15 against the Washington Senators at Griffith Stadium, Stephens scattered eight hits, all singles, in a complete game, 9\u20131 triumph over eventual Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Early Wynn. Sent to the bullpen by manager Lou Boudreau, Stephens then went over a month before his next starting assignment \u2014 again at Washington and against Wynn. This time, on June 19, Stephens took the loss, 3\u20132, and left for a pinch hitter after the fifth inning. Altogether, he made five starts for Cleveland was used exclusively as a relief pitcher after July 15. He fashioned a 5\u201310 win\u2013loss mark and a 4.01 earned run average, with one save, in 92 innings pitched for the Indians.\nStephens was traded on November 20, 1947, with $25,000, Joe Frazier, and Dick Kokos for Walt Judnich and Bob Muncrief. Stephens worked out of the bullpen early in the 1948 season before making six successive starts during June; however, he lost his first four decisions before throwing another complete game, a 9\u20136 win over the Boston Red Sox at Sportsman's Park, winning the game himself by driving in three runs with an eighth-inning double off Mel Parnell.  (Bryan Stephens was one of three players with a similar surname who played in that game, including Boston's Vern Stephens and the Browns' first baseman, Chuck Stevens.) But Bryan Stephens' year with the Browns had few bright spots: he collected three saves and posted three wins, against six losses, with a poor 6.02 earned run average in 122+2\u20443 innings pitched.  He spent the next two seasons, his last as a professional, in the minors.\nAll told, Stephens allowed 220 hits and 106 bases on balls in 214+2\u20443 Major League innings pitched, with 69 strikeouts."

        "content": "Gualberto Fabricio de Vagad was an Aragonese Cistercian Benedictine monk and the first historian of the Kingdom of Aragon. He was born in Zaragoza in the first third of the fifteenth century and straddles the line between the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. He lived most of his life at the monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Santa Fe, though he also spent some time at San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a. According to F\u00e9lix de Latassa y Ort\u00edn, besides history he wrote various treatises on poetry and a compendium of verse.\nVagad's magnum opus, the Cr\u00f3nica de Arag\u00f3n, a vernacular Romance history of Aragon from the mythical Kingdom of Sobrarbe (founded 724) up to the death of Alfonso V (1458), was published in Zaragoza in 1499; its incunabula survive. It was commissioned by the deputies of Ferdinand II of Aragon, who named Vagad cronista mayor (senior chronicler), though the office of cronista was not formally instituted until the Cortes of Monz\u00f3n in 1547.\nFor the work Vagad consulted the archives of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a, San Victori\u00e1n, Poblet, Montearag\u00f3n, and Barcelona among other archives of the Crown of Aragon. In international matters he was a Spanish partisan and this bias enters into his history: he considered the Emperor Maximilian I a Spaniard and made the legendary Count Julian an Italian. In peninsular matters his Aragonese bias is evident, as when he devalues the conquest of Valencia by the Castilian folk hero El Cid (1094) relative to the conquest of the same city by James I of Aragon (1236). The work contains three prologues. In the first Vagad heaps praise on Spain in the tradition of Isidore's Laus Spaniae; in the second he argues from history for the preeminence of Aragon amongst the kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula; and in the third he defends the importance of Zaragoza as the chief city of Spain. Preoccupied with style, his narrative is frequently interrupted by lengthy and banal arguments. Eduard Fueter, the Swiss historian of universal historiography, writes that Vagad's Cr\u00f3nica contains the \"timid critical germs of the medieval tradition\" (t\u00edmidos g\u00e9rmenes de cr\u00edtica de la tradici\u00f3n medieval)."

Her mother, Ada Timmons, died when Gladys was less than a year old.At fourteen, she entered the theater world in a stock company, before moving on to vaudeville. In vaudeville, she met her husband, Lee Gresham, and the two formed an act together. While performing in Los Angeles, they were noticed by producer Edward Small, which led to her beginning in the film industry.Blake made her film debut in a small role in I Have Lived (1933), directed by Richard Thorpe. She had her first featured role later that same year in Rainbow over Broadway, which Thorpe also directed.Over her 20-year career, she appeared in over 100 films. She was noted for playing very talkative supporting roles.Appearing mostly in supporting or bit parts, she was occasionally given a featured role, as in Lucky Night (1939), which starred Myrna Loy and Robert Taylor; or Woman of the Year (1942), which starred Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, in which she played Flo Peters, the wife of a friend of Tracy's character. Even more rarely she would be given the lead in a film, such as in Racing Blood (1936). In the early 1940s, she played the recurring role of \"Maisie\" in several of the Dr. Kildare films starring Lew Ayres, Lionel Barrymore, and Laraine Day.Other notable films in which she appeared include: Ship Ahoy (1942), starring Eleanor Powell and Red Skelton; the Abbott and Costello film, Who Done It?; the 1943 version of Phantom of the Opera, starring Claude Raines; The Naughty Nineties, again with Abbott and Costello; On the Town; The Yellow Cab Man, starring Red Skelton; and the 1952 epic, The Greatest Show on Earth.Blake's final role was in 1952's This Woman is Dangerous, starring Joan Crawford and Dennis Morgan, in which she plays a garrulous hairdresser.Blake died on May 21, 1983, aged 73, in Sacramento, California."

In 1975, he was part of the team that won the First Division, contributing 17 appearances and 2 goals. In 1976, Derby County loaned Bourne to the Dallas Tornado of the North American Soccer League (NASL). When it became apparent that Bourne would never be more than a sporadic player with the club, Derby County sold his contract to Crystal Palace F.C. for \u00a330,000 in March 1977. At the time that Bourne joined Crystal Palace the team was in a free fall. They had slipped from the top division to the third in two seasons and appeared in danger of falling further. Crystal Palace had just sold Paul Hammond to the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the NASL. They then used the cash to purchase Bourne. Bourne made an immediate impact, scoring nine goals in fifteen games and helping Crystal Palace return to the Second Division. Despite his contribution, Bourne was considered a poor long-term investment and he was sent to the Dallas Tornado in the spring of 1978."

        "content": "While stats for Thompson's career in terms of wins and losses were not officially measured until his last year in 1950, he is reported to have made 46 starts with 99 total game appearances.\nAfter a forgettable season to start his career in 1940 with Pittsburgh, he ended up playing with cross-town team Philadelphia. The first two seasons spent with Philadelphia were miserable, as the Eagles won two games each, while he was an off-and-on starter. Upon his return to the Eagles in 1945, the fortunes of the team had improved, as they won at least six games and finished at least third in each year, buoyed by Thompson and Steve Van Buren (starting play with the team in 1944), who would eventually be named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.In the three-year run for the Eagles to three straight NFL championship appearances from 1947 to 1949, Thompson would throw for 57 total touchdowns while Van Buren would run for 34 touchdowns.\nIn 1948 and 1949, he would lead the league in passer rating, and his 25 touchdowns in the former year was a league high: he was just the second quarterback to lead the league in consecutive years in the category (after Ed Danowski) and just the fourth to lead the league multiple times (after Danowski, Sid Luckman, and Sammy Baugh). In 1947, the Eagles won eight of twelve games and wound up tied with Pittsburgh in the division, meaning a tiebreaker game was required to determine who would play in the NFL Championship Game\nThompson was the starting quarterback for the Eagles in the game, and went 11-of-17 for 131 yards and two touchdowns. His 15-yard score to Steve Van Buren in the first quarter proved to be the winning score, as the Eagles went on to shut out the Steelers 21\u20130. For the 1947 NFL Championship Game, there was no primary starter at quarterback on either team, although Thompson did play. Facing the Chicago Cardinals, he threw 27-of-44 passes for 297 yards for one touchdown and three interceptions. The game was mostly even-matched in passing and rushing, but the Cardinals started with a 14\u20130 lead by the time the Eagles ended up getting on the board, and after that they traded scores as the Cardinals held on to win 28\u201321, after having possession for the last five minutes.The following year, he helped lead the Eagles to another division crown. On December 19, in the 1948 NFL Championship Game, he would partake in one of the most famous weather games, as snow rained down on Shibe Park that made running an even more important commodity: each team combined for over 300 yards on the ground to just 42 passing. Facing the Cardinals once again, he went 2-of-12 for 7 yards and two interceptions while running for 50 yards on 11 carries. However, Steve Van Buren would win the game on a touchdown run early in the fourth quarter to give the Eagles the one and only score needed to win Philadelphia's first championship, with Thompson and Van Buren each getting credit from coach Greasy Neale for the win.In 1949, the Eagles were even better, losing just one game as Thompson and the team would make it to a third consecutive NFL Championship Game. Facing the upstart Los Angeles Rams on a mudpit, he threw for 5-of-9 for 68 yards with one touchdown and one interception. His 31-yard touchdown to Pete Pihos in the second quarter was both the longest pass he threw all day and the winning score as the Eagles shut out the Rams 14\u20130.Thompson closed his career in 1950 with a 6\u20136 record, having thrown for 1,608 yards with 11 touchdowns to 22 interceptions.One highlight included him becoming the fourth quarterback to ever throw for 10,000 yards in a career: for context, he finished fourth in passing yards all-time, behind Sammy Baugh, Sid Luckman and Otto Graham, all of whom were later inducted into the Hall of Fame. In the seven decades that have followed since Thompson retired, he fell from 4th to 193rd, a reflection of the growing trend in passing.Thompson is one of four eligible inactive NFL quarterbacks with multiple championships who have not yet been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, along with Jim Plunkett, Tobin Rote, and Jack Kemp. Ray Didinger of The Philadelphia Inquirer called him a \"clever ballhandler\" who had the ideal hands that would be part of what a dream signal-caller for an Eagles quarterback.In 1953, Thompson made a brief return to football by playing with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers while serving as their backfield coach. He only played three games with them."

        "content": "Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi (c.\u20091445 \u2013 May 17, 1510), better known as Sandro Botticelli ( BOT-ih-CHEL-ee, Italian: [\u02c8sandro botti\u02c8t\u0283\u025blli]) or simply Botticelli, was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance. Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century, when he was rediscovered by the Pre-Raphaelites who stimulated a reappraisal of his work. Since then, his paintings have been seen to represent the linear grace of late Italian Gothic and some Early Renaissance painting, even though they date from the latter half of the Italian Renaissance period.\nIn addition to the mythological subjects for which he is best known today, Botticelli painted a wide range of religious subjects (including dozens of renditions of the Madonna and Child, many in the round tondo shape) and also some portraits. His best-known works are The Birth of Venus and Primavera, both in the Uffizi in Florence, which holds many of Botticelli's works. Botticelli lived all his life in the same neighbourhood of Florence; his only significant times elsewhere were the months he spent painting in Pisa in 1474 and the Sistine Chapel in Rome in 1481\u201382.Only one of Botticelli's paintings, the Mystic Nativity (National Gallery, London) is inscribed with a date (1501), but others can be dated with varying degrees of certainty on the basis of archival records, so the development of his style can be traced with some confidence.  He was an independent master for all the 1470s, which saw his reputation soar. The 1480s were his most successful decade, the one in which his large mythological paintings were completed along with many of his most famous Madonnas.  By the 1490s, his style became more personal and to some extent mannered. His last works show him moving in a direction opposite to that of Leonardo da Vinci (seven years his junior) and the new generation of painters creating the High Renaissance style, and instead returning to a style that many have described as more Gothic or \"archaic\"."

        "content": "Botticelli was born in the city of Florence in a house on the street still called Borgo Ognissanti. He lived in the same area all his life and was buried in his neighbourhood church called Ognissanti (\"All Saints\").  Sandro was one of several children to the tanner Mariano di Vanni d'Amedeo Filipepi and his wife Smeralda Filipepi, and the youngest of the four who survived into adulthood. The date of his birth is not known, but his father's tax returns in following years give his age as two in 1447 and thirteen in 1458, meaning he must have been born between 1444 and 1446.In 1460 Botticelli's father ceased his business as a tanner and became a gold-beater with his other son, Antonio. This profession would have brought the family into contact with a range of artists. Giorgio Vasari, in his Life of Botticelli, reported that Botticelli was initially trained as a goldsmith.The Ognissanti neighbourhood was \"a modest one, inhabited by weavers and other workmen,\" but there were some rich families, most notably the Rucellai, a wealthy clan of bankers and wool-merchants. The family's head, Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai, commissioned the famous Palazzo Rucellai, a landmark in Italian Renaissance architecture, from Leon Battista Alberti, between 1446 and 1451, Botticelli's earliest years. By 1458, Botticelli's family was renting their house from the Rucellai, which was just one of many dealings that involved the two families.In 1464, his father bought a house in the nearby Via Nuova (now called Via della Porcellana) in which Sandro lived from 1470 (if not  earlier) until his death in 1510. Botticelli both lived and worked in the house (a rather unusual practice) despite his brothers Giovanni and Simone also being resident there. The family's most notable neighbours were the Vespucci, including Amerigo Vespucci, after whom the Americas were named. The Vespucci were Medici allies and eventually regular patrons of Botticelli.The nickname Botticelli, meaning \"little barrel\", derives from the nickname of Sandro's brother, Giovanni, who was called Botticello apparently because of his round stature. A document of 1470 refers to Sandro as \"Sandro Mariano Botticelli\", meaning that he had fully adopted the name."

        "content": "From around 1461 or 1462 Botticelli was apprenticed to Fra Filippo Lippi, one of the leading Florentine painters and a favorite of the Medici.  It was from Lippi that Botticelli learned how to create intimate compositions with beautiful, melancholic figures drawn with clear contours and only slight contrasts of light and shadow.  For much of this period Lippi was based in Prato, a few miles west of Florence, frescoing the apse of what is now Prato Cathedral. Botticelli probably left Lippi's workshop by April 1467, when the latter went to work in Spoleto. There has been much speculation as to whether Botticelli spent a shorter period of time in another workshop, such as that of the Pollaiuolo brothers or Andrea del Verrocchio. However, although both artists had a strong impact on the young Botticelli's development, the young artist's presence in their workshops cannot be definitively proven.Lippi died in 1469. Botticelli must have had his own workshop by then, and in June of that year he was commissioned a panel of Fortitude (Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi) to accompany a set of all Seven Virtues commissioned one year earlier from Piero del Pollaiuolo. Botticelli's panel adopts the format and composition of Piero's, but features a more elegant and naturally posed figure and includes an array of \"fanciful enrichments so as to show up Piero's poverty of ornamental invention.\"In 1472 Botticelli took on his first apprentice, the young Filippino Lippi, son of his master. Botticelli and Filippino's works from these years, including many Madonna and Child paintings, are often difficult to distinguish from one another. The two also routinely collaborated, as in the panels from a dismantled pair of cassoni, now divided between the Louvre, the National Gallery of Canada, the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9 in Chantilly and the Galleria Pallavicini in Rome."

        "content": "In 1481, Pope Sixtus IV summoned Botticelli and other prominent Florentine and Umbrian artists to fresco the walls of the newly completed Sistine Chapel.  This large project was to be the main decoration of the chapel.  Most of the frescos remain but are greatly overshadowed and disrupted by Michelangelo's work of the next century, as some of the earlier frescos were destroyed to make room for his paintings. The Florentine contribution is thought to be part of a peace deal between Lorenzo Medici and the papacy.  After Sixtus was implicated in the Pazzi conspiracy hostilities had escalated into excommunication for Lorenzo and other Florentine officials and a small \"Pazzi War\".The iconographic scheme was a pair of cycles, facing each other on the sides of the chapel, of the Life of Christ and the Life of Moses, together suggesting the supremacy of the Papacy.  Botticelli's contribution included three of the original fourteen large scenes: the Temptations of Christ, Youth of Moses and Punishment of the Sons of Corah (or various other titles), as well as several of the imagined portraits of popes in the level above, and paintings of unknown subjects in the lunettes above, where Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling now is.  He may have also done a fourth scene on the end wall opposite the altar, now destroyed. Each painter brought a team of assistants from his workshop, as the space to be covered was considerable; each of the main panels is some 3.5 by 5.7 metres, and the work was done in a few months.\nVasari implies that Botticelli was given overall artistic charge of the project, but modern art historians think it more likely that Pietro Perugino, the first artist to be employed, was given this role, if anyone was. The subjects and many details to be stressed in their execution were no doubt handed to the artists by the Vatican authorities.  The schemes present a complex and coherent programme asserting Papal supremacy, and are more unified in this than in their artistic style, although the artists follow a consistent scale and broad compositional layout, with crowds of figures in the foreground and mainly landscape in the top half of the scene.  Allowing for the painted pilasters that separate each scene, the level of the horizon matches between scenes, and Moses wears the same yellow and green clothes in his scenes.Botticelli differs from his colleagues in imposing a more insistent triptych-like composition, dividing each of his scenes into a main central group with two flanking groups at the sides, showing different incidents. In each the principal figure of Christ or Moses appears several times, seven in the case of the Youth of Moses. The thirty invented portraits of the earliest popes seem to have been mainly Botticelli's responsibility, at least as far as producing the cartoons went. Of those surviving, most scholars agree that ten were designed by Botticelli, and five probably at least partly by him, although all have been damaged and restored.The Punishment of the Sons of Corah contains what was for Botticelli an unusually close, if not exact, copy of a classical work.  This is the rendering in the centre of the north side of the Arch of Constantine in Rome, which he repeated in about 1500 in The Story of Lucretia. If he was apparently not spending his spare time in Rome drawing antiquities, as many artists of his day were very keen to do, he does seem to have painted there an Adoration of the Magi, now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington. In 1482 he returned to Florence, and apart from his lost frescos for the Medici villa at Spedaletto a year or so later, no further trips away from home are recorded.  He had perhaps been away from July 1481 to, at the latest, May 1482."

        "content": "The masterpieces Primavera (c. 1482) and The Birth of Venus (c. 1485) are not a pair, but are inevitably discussed together; both are in the Uffizi.  They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the Italian Renaissance.  As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity.  Together with the smaller and less celebrated Venus and Mars and Pallas and the Centaur, they have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations, the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism, and the identity of the commissioners and possible models for the figures.Though all carry differing degrees of complexity in their meanings, they also have an immediate visual appeal that accounts for their enormous popularity.  All show dominant and beautiful female figures in an idyllic world of feeling, with a sexual element. Continuing scholarly attention mainly focuses on the poetry and philosophy of contemporary Renaissance humanists. The works do not illustrate particular texts; rather, each relies upon several texts for its significance. Their beauty was characterized by Vasari as exemplifying \"grace\" and by John Ruskin as possessing linear rhythm.  The pictures feature Botticelli's linear style at its most effective, emphasized by the soft continual contours and pastel colours.The Primavera and the Birth were both seen by Vasari in the mid-16th century at the Villa di Castello, owned from 1477 by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, and until the publication in 1975 of a Medici inventory of 1499, it was assumed that both works were painted specifically for the villa. Recent scholarship suggests otherwise: the Primavera was painted for Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's townhouse in Florence, and The Birth of Venus was commissioned by someone else for a different site.\nBotticelli painted only a small number of mythological subjects, but these are now probably his best known works.  A much smaller panel than those discussed before is his Venus and Mars in the National Gallery, London.  This was of a size and shape to suggest that it was a spalliera, a painting made to fitted into either furniture, or more likely in this case, wood panelling.  The wasps buzzing around Mars' head suggest that it may have been painted for a member of his neighbours the Vespucci family, whose name means \"little wasps\" in Italian, and who featured wasps in their coat of arms.  Mars lies asleep, presumably after lovemaking, while Venus watches as infant satyrs play with his military gear, and one tries to rouse him by blowing a conch shell in his ear. The painting was no doubt given to celebrate a marriage, and decorate the bedchamber.Three of these four large mythologies feature Venus, a central figure in Renaissance Neoplatonism, which gave divine love as important a place in its philosophy as did Christianity.  The fourth, Pallas and the Centaur is clearly connected with the Medici by the symbol on Pallas' dress.  The two figures are roughly life-size, and a number of specific personal, political or philosophic interpretations have been proposed to expand on the basic meaning of the submission of passion to reason.A series of panels in the form of an spalliera or cassone were commissioned from Botticelli by Antonio Pucci in 1483 on the occasion of the marriage of his son Giannozzo with Lucrezia Bini. The subject was the story of' Nastagio degli Onesti from the eighth novel of the fifth day of Boccaccio's Decameron, in four panels. The coats of arms of the Medici and the bride and groom's families appear in the third panel."

        "content": "Botticelli returned from Rome in 1482 with a reputation considerably enhanced by his work there.  As with his secular paintings, many religious commissions are larger and no doubt more expensive than before. Altogether more datable works by Botticelli come from the 1480s than any other decade, and most of these are religious.  By the mid-1480s, many leading Florentine artists had left the city, some never to return.  The rising star Leonardo da Vinci, who scoffed at Botticelli's landscapes, left in 1481 for Milan, the Pollaiolo brothers in 1484 for Rome, and Andrea Verrochio in 1485 for Venice.The remaining leaders of Florentine painting, Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Filippino Lippi, worked on a major fresco cycle with Perugino, for Lorenzo the Magnificent's villa at Spedalletto near Volterra. Botticelli painted many Madonnas, covered in a section below, and altarpieces and frescos in Florentine churches. In 1491 he served on a committee to decide upon a fa\u00e7ade for the Cathedral of Florence, receiving the next year three payments for a design for a scheme, eventually abortive, to put mosaics on some interior roof vaults in the cathedral."

        "content": "Paintings of the Madonna and Child, that is, the Virgin Mary and infant Jesus, were enormously popular in 15th-century Italy in a range of sizes and formats, from large altarpieces of the sacra conversazione type to small paintings for the home.  They also often hung in offices, public buildings, shops and clerical institutions. These smaller paintings were a steady source of income for painters at all levels of quality, and many were probably produced for stock, without a specific commission.Botticelli painted Madonnas from the start of his career until at least the 1490s. He was one of the first painters to use the round tondo format, with the painted area typically some 115 to 145 cm across (about four to five feet).  This format was more associated with paintings for palaces than churches, though they were large enough to be hung in churches, and some were later donated to them. Several Madonnas use this format, usually with a seated Virgin shown down to the knees, and though rectangular pictures of the Madonna outnumber them, Madonnas in tondo form are especially associated with Botticelli.  He used the tondo format for other subjects, such as an early Adoration of the Magi in London, and was apparently more likely to paint a tondo Madonna himself, usually leaving rectangular ones to his workshop.\nBotticelli's Virgins are always beautiful, in the same idealized way as his mythological figures, and often richly dressed in contemporary style.  Although Savonarola's main strictures were against secular art, he also complained of the paintings in Florentine churches that \"You have made the Virgin appear dressed as a whore\", which may have had an effect on Botticelli's style.  They are often accompanied by equally beautiful angels, or an infant Saint John the Baptist (the patron saint of Florence).  Some feature flowers, and none the detailed landscape backgrounds that other artists were developing.  Many exist in several versions of varying quality, often with the elements other than the Virgin and Child different.  Many of these were produced by Botticelli or, especially, his workshop, and others apparently by unconnected artists.  When interest in Botticelli revived in the 19th century, it was initially largely in his Madonnas, which then began to be forged on a considerable scale.In the Magnificat Madonna in the Uffizi (118 cm or 46.5 inches across, c. 1483), Mary is writing down the Magnificat, a speech from the Gospel of Luke (1:46\u201355) where it is spoken by Mary upon the occasion of her Visitation to her cousin Elizabeth, some months before the birth of Jesus.  She holds the baby Jesus, and is surrounded by wingless angels impossible to distinguish from fashionably-dressed Florentine youths.Botticelli's Madonna and Child with Angels Carrying Candlesticks (1485/1490) was destroyed during World War II. It was stored in the Friedrichshain flak tower in Berlin for safe keeping, but in May 1945, the tower was set on fire and most of the objects inside were destroyed. Also lost were Botticelli's Madonna and Child with Infant Saint John and an Annunciation."

        "content": "Botticelli painted a number of portraits, although not nearly as many as have been attributed to him.  There are a number of idealized portrait-like paintings of women which probably do not represent a specific person (several closely resemble the Venus in his Venus and Mars). Traditional gossip links these to the famous beauty Simonetta Vespucci, who died aged twenty-two in 1476, but this seems unlikely. These figures represent a secular link to his Madonnas.\nWith one or two exceptions his small independent panel portraits show the sitter no further down the torso than about the bottom of the rib-cage.  Women are normally in profile, full or just a little turned, whereas men are normally a \"three-quarters\" pose, but never quite seen completely frontally.  Even when the head is facing more or less straight ahead, the lighting is used to create a difference between the sides of the face.  Backgrounds may be plain, or show an open window, usually with nothing but sky visible through it. A few have developed landscape backgrounds.  These characteristics were typical of Florentine portraits at the beginning of his career, but old-fashioned by his last years.Many portraits exist in several versions, probably most mainly by the workshop; there is often uncertainty in their attribution. Often the background changes between versions while the figure remains the same.  His male portraits have also often held dubious identifications, most often of various Medicis, for longer than the real evidence supports. Lightbown attributes him only with about eight portraits of individuals, all but three from before about 1475.Botticelli often slightly exaggerates aspects of the features to increase the likeness. He also painted portraits in other works, as when he inserted a self-portrait and the Medici into his early Adoration of the Magi. Several figures in the Sistine Chapel frescos appear to be portraits, but the subjects are unknown, although fanciful guesses have been made. Large allegorical frescos from a villa show members of the Tornabuoni family together with gods and personifications; probably not all of these survive but ones with portraits of a young man with the Seven Liberal Arts and a young woman with Venus and the Three Graces are now in the Louvre."

        "content": "Botticelli had a lifelong interest in the great Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, which produced works in several media. He is attributed with an imagined portrait. According to Vasari, he \"wrote a commentary on a portion of Dante\", which is also referred to dismissively in another story in the Life, but no such text has survived.\nBotticelli's attempt to design the illustrations for a printed book was unprecedented for a leading painter, and though it seems to have been something of a flop, this was a role for artists that had an important future. Vasari wrote disapprovingly of the first printed Dante in 1481 with engravings by the goldsmith Baccio Baldini, engraved from drawings by Botticelli: \"being of a sophistical turn of mind, he there wrote a commentary on a portion of Dante and illustrated the Inferno which he printed, spending much time over it, and this abstention from work led to serious disorders in his living.\" Vasari, who lived when printmaking had become far more important than in Botticelli's day, never takes it seriously, perhaps because his own paintings did not sell well in reproduction.\n\nThe Divine Comedy consists of 100 cantos and the printed text left space for one engraving for each canto. However, only 19 illustrations were engraved, and most copies of the book have only the first two or three.  The first two, and sometimes three, are usually printed on the book page, while the later ones are printed on separate sheets that are pasted into place.  This suggests that the production of the engravings lagged behind the printing, and the later illustrations were pasted into the stock of printed and bound books, and perhaps sold to those who had already bought the book.  Unfortunately Baldini was neither very experienced nor talented as an engraver, and was unable to express the delicacy of Botticelli's style in his plates. Two religious engravings are also generally accepted to be after designs by Botticelli.Botticelli later began a luxury manuscript illustrated Dante on parchment, most of which was taken only as far as the underdrawings, and only a few pages are fully illuminated.  This manuscript has 93 surviving pages (32 x 47 cm), now divided between the Vatican Library (8 sheets) and Berlin (83), and represents the bulk of Botticelli's surviving drawings.Once again, the project was never completed, even at the drawing stage, but some of the early cantos appear to have been at least drawn but are now missing.  The pages that survive have always been greatly admired, and much discussed, as the project raises many questions.  The general consensus is that most of the drawings are late; the main scribe can be identified as Niccol\u00f2 Mangona, who worked in Florence between 1482 and 1503, whose work presumably preceded that of Dante.  Botticelli then appears to have worked on the drawings over a long period, as stylistic development can be seen, and matched to his paintings.  Although other patrons have been proposed (inevitably including Medicis, in particular the younger Lorenzo, or il Magnifico), some scholars think that Botticelli made the manuscript for himself.\nThere are hints that Botticelli may have worked on illustrations for printed pamphlets by Savonarola, almost all destroyed after his fall."

        "content": "Botticelli became associated by historians with the Florentine School under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, a movement historians would later characterize as a \"golden age\".  The Medici family were effective rulers of Florence, which was nominally a republic, throughout Botticelli's lifetime up to 1494, when the main branch were expelled.  Lorenzo il Magnifico became the head of the family in 1469, just around the time Botticelli started his own workshop.  He was a great patron of both the visual and literary arts, and encouraged and financed the humanist and Neoplatonist circle from which much of the character of Botticelli's mythological painting seems to come.  In general Lorenzo does not seem to have commissioned much from Botticelli, preferring Pollaiuolo and others, although views on this differ. A Botticello who was probably Sandro's brother Giovanni was close to Lorenzo.Although the patrons of many works not for churches remain unclear, Botticelli seems to have been used more by Lorenzo il Magnifico's two young cousins, his younger brother Giuliano, and other families allied to the Medici.  Tommaso Soderini, a close ally of Lorenzo, obtained the commission for the figure of Fortitude of 1470 which is Botticelli's earliest securely dated painting, completing a series of the Seven Virtues left unfinished by Piero del Pollaiuolo.  Possibly they had been introduced by a Vespucci who had tutored Soderini's son.  Antonio Pucci, another Medici ally, probably commissioned the London Adoration of the Magi, also around 1470.Giuliano de' Medici was assassinated in the Pazzi conspiracy of 1478 (Lorenzo narrowly escaped, saved by his bank manager), and a portrait said to be Giuliano which survives in several versions may be posthumous, or with at least one version from not long before his death. He is also a focus for theories that figures in the mythological paintings represent specific individuals from Florentine high society, usually paired with Simonetta Vespucci, who John Ruskin persuaded himself had posed nude for Botticelli."

        "content": "According to Vasari, Botticelli became a follower of the deeply moralistic Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola, who preached in Florence from 1490 until his execution in 1498:\nBotticelli was a follower of Savonarola's, and this was why he gave up painting and then fell into considerable distress as he had no other source of income.  None the less, he remained an obstinate member of the sect, becoming one of the piagnoni, the snivellers, as they were called then, and abandoning his work; so finally, as an old man, he found himself so poor that if Lorenzo de' Medici ... and then his friends and ... [others] had not come to his assistance, he would have almost died of hunger.\nThe extent of Savonarola's influence on Botticelli remains uncertain; his brother Simone was more clearly a follower. The story, sometimes seen, that he had destroyed his own paintings on secular subjects in the 1497 bonfire of the vanities  is not told by Vasari.  Vasari's assertion that Botticelli produced nothing after coming under the influence of Savonarola is not accepted by modern art historians.  The Mystical Nativity, Botticelli's only painting to carry an actual date, if one cryptically expressed, comes from late 1500, eighteen months after Savonarola died, and the development of his style can be traced through a number of late works, as discussed below.  \n\nIn late 1502, some four years after Savonarola's death, Isabella d'Este wanted a painting done in Florence.  Her agent Francesco Malatesta wrote to inform her that her first choice, Perugino, was away, Filippino Lippi had a full schedule for six months, but Botticelli was free to start at once, and ready to oblige.  She preferred to wait for Perugino's return. This again casts serious doubt on Vasari's assertion, but equally he does not seem to have been in great demand.Many datings of works have a range up to 1505, though he did live a further five years. But Botticelli apparently produced little work after 1501, or perhaps earlier, and his production had already reduced after about 1495.  This may be partly because of the time he devoted to the drawings for the manuscript Dante. In 1504 he was a member of the committee appointed to decide where Michelangelo's David would be placed.Botticelli returned to subjects from antiquity in the 1490s, with a few smaller works on subjects from ancient history containing more figures and showing different scenes from each story, including moments of dramatic action. These are the Calumny of Apelles (c. 1494\u201395), a recreation of a lost allegory by the ancient Greek painter Apelles, which he may have intended for his personal use, and the pair of The Story of Virginia and The Story of Lucretia, which are probably from around 1500.\nThe Mystical Nativity, a relatively small and very personal painting, perhaps for his own use, appears to be dated to the end of 1500. It takes to an extreme the abandonment of consistent scale among the figures that had been a feature of Botticelli's religious paintings for some years, with the Holy Family much larger than the other figures, even those well in front of them in the picture space. This may be seen as a partial reversion to Gothic conventions.  The iconography of the familiar subject of the Nativity is unique, with features including devils hiding in the rock below the scene, and must be highly personal.Another painting, known as the Mystic Crucifixion (now Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University), clearly relates to the state, and fate, of Florence, shown in the background behind Christ on the Cross, beside which an angel whips a marzocco, the heraldic lion that is a symbol of the city. This can be connected more directly to the convulsions of the expulsion of the Medici, Savonarola's brief supremacy, and the French invasion.  Unfortunately it is very damaged, such that it may not be by Botticelli, while it is certainly in his style.His later work, especially as seen in the four panels with Scenes from the Life of Saint Zenobius, witnessed a diminution of scale, expressively distorted figures, and a non-naturalistic use of colour reminiscent of the work of Fra Angelico nearly a century earlier.  Botticelli has been compared to the Venetian painter Carlo Crivelli, some ten years older, whose later work also veers away from the imminent High Renaissance style, instead choosing to \"move into a distinctly Gothic idiom\". Other scholars have seen premonitions of Mannerism in the simplified expressionist depiction of emotions in his works of the last years.Ernst Steinmann (d. 1934) detected in the later Madonnas a  \"deepening of insight and expression in the rendering of Mary's physiognomy\", which he attributed to Savonarola's influence (also pushing back the dating of some of these Madonnas.) More recent scholars are reluctant to assign direct influence, though there is certainly a replacement of elegance and sweetness with forceful austerity in the last period.\nBotticelli continued to pay his dues to the Compagnia di San Luca (a confraternity rather than the artist's guild) until at least October 1505; the tentative date ranges assigned to his late paintings run no further than this.  By then he was aged sixty or more, in this period definitely into old age. Vasari, who lived in Florence from around 1527, says that Botticelli died \"ill and decrepit, at the age of seventy-eight\", after a period when he was \"unable to stand upright and moving around with the help of crutches\". He died in May 1510, but is now thought to have been something under seventy at the time.  He was buried with his family outside the Ognissanti Church in a spot the church has now built over. This had been his parish church since he was baptized there, and contained his Saint Augustine in His Study."

Apart from the Dante illustrations, only a small number of these survive, none of which can be connected with surviving paintings, or at least not their final compositions, although they appear to be preparatory drawings rather than independent works.  Some may be connected with the work in other media that we know Botticelli did.  Three vestments survive with embroidered designs by him, and he developed a new technique for decorating banners for religious and secular processions, apparently in some kind of appliqu\u00e9 technique (called commesso)."

By 1480 there were three, none of them subsequently of note.   Other names occur in the record, but only Lippi became a well-known master. A considerable number of works, especially Madonnas, are attributed to Botticelli's workshop, or the master and his workshop, generally meaning that Botticelli did the underdrawing, while the assistants did the rest, or drawings by him were copied by the workshop.Botticelli's linear style was relatively easy to imitate, making different contributions within one work hard to identify, though the quality of the master's drawing makes works entirely by others mostly identifiable.  The attribution of many works remains debated, especially in terms of distinguishing the share of work between master and workshop.  Lightbown believed that \"the division between Botticelli's autograph works and the paintings from his workshop and circle is a fairly sharp one\", and that in only one major work on panel \"do we find important parts executed by assistants\"; but others might disagree.\nThe National Gallery have an Adoration of the Kings of about 1470, which they describe as begun by Filippino Lippi but finished by Botticelli, noting how unusual it was for a master to take over a work begun by a pupil."

        "content": "After his death, Botticelli's reputation was eclipsed longer and more thoroughly than that of any other major European artist. His paintings remained in the churches and villas for which they had been created, and his frescos in the Sistine Chapel were upstaged by those of Michelangelo.There are a few mentions of paintings and their location in sources from the decades after his death.  Vasari's Life is relatively short and, especially in the first edition of 1550, rather disapproving. According to the Ettlingers \"he is clearly ill at ease with Sandro and did not know how to fit him into his evolutionary scheme of the history of art running from Cimabue to Michelangelo\". Nonetheless, this is the main source of information about his life, even though Vasari twice mixes him up with Francesco Botticini, another Florentine painter of the day.  Vasari saw Botticelli as a firm partisan of the anti-Medici faction influenced by Savonarola, while Vasari himself relied heavily on the patronage of the returned Medicis of his own day.  Vasari also saw him as an artist who had abandoned his talent in his last years, which offended his high idea of the artistic vocation.  He devotes a good part of his text to rather alarming anecdotes of practical jokes by Botticelli.  Vasari was born the year after Botticelli's death, but would have known many Florentines with memories of him.\nIn 1621 a picture-buying agent of Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua bought him a painting said to be a Botticelli out of historical interest \"as from the hand of an artist by whom Your Highness has nothing, and who was the master of Leonardo da Vinci\". That mistake is perhaps understandable, as although Leonardo was only some six years younger than Botticelli, his style could seem to a Baroque judge to be a generation more advanced.\n\nThe Birth of Venus was displayed in the Uffizi from 1815, but is little mentioned in travellers' accounts of the gallery over the next two decades.  The Berlin gallery bought the Bardi Altarpiece in 1829, but the National Gallery, London only bought a Madonna (now regarded as by his workshop) in 1855.The English collector William Young Ottley bought Botticelli's The Mystical Nativity in Italy, bringing it to London in 1799. But when he tried to sell it in 1811, no buyer could be found. After Ottley's death, its next purchaser, William Fuller Maitland of Stansted, allowed it to be exhibited in a major art exhibition held in Manchester in 1857, the Art Treasures Exhibition, where among many other art works it was viewed by more than a million people.  His only large painting with a mythological subject ever to be sold on the open market is the Venus and Mars, bought at Christie's by the National Gallery for a rather modest \u00a31,050 in 1874. The rare 21st-century auction results include in 2013 the Rockefeller Madonna, sold at Christie's for US$10.4 million, and in 2021 the Portrait of a Young Man Holding a Roundel, sold at Sotheby's for US$92.2 million.The first nineteenth-century art historian to be enthusiastic about Botticelli's Sistine frescoes was Alexis-Fran\u00e7ois Rio; Anna Brownell Jameson and Charles Eastlake were alerted to Botticelli as well, and works by his hand began to appear in German collections. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood incorporated elements of his work into their own.Walter Pater created a literary picture of Botticelli, who was then taken up by the Aesthetic movement. The first monograph on the artist was published in 1893, the same year as Aby Warburg's seminal dissertation on the mythologies; then, between 1900 and 1920 more books were written on Botticelli than on any other painter. Herbert Horne's monograph in English from 1908 is still recognised as of exceptional quality and thoroughness, \"one of the most stupendous achievements in Renaissance studies\".Botticelli appears as a character, sometimes a main one, in numerous fictional depictions of 15th-century Florence in various media.  He was portrayed by Sebastian de Souza in the second season of the TV series Medici: Masters of Florence.The main belt asteroid 29361 Botticelli discovered on 9 February 1996, is named after him."

He spent a one-year sabbatical with Pierre and Marie Curie in their radium research laboratory at the University of Paris in 1906 and was then invited to work with them from 1907 to 1912. He published 17 scientific papers during this time mostly around the properties of X-rays from radioactive sources and the measurement of heat generated from radioactive disintegration.  Although none of the papers were in direct collaboration with the Curies, he worked closely with them and it was reported that when Marie Curie visited America years later, she stated that she most wanted to see \"Niagara Falls, The Grand Canyon and William Duane\"Duane refined a technique for extracting radon-222 gas from radium sulfate solutions. Solutions containing 1 gram of radium were \"milked\" to create radon \"seeds\" of about 20 millicuries each.  These \"seeds\" were distributed throughout Paris for use in endocurietherapy. Duane perfected this \"milking\" technique during his time in Paris and referred to the device as a \"radium cow\".He returned to the United States in 1913 and worked in a joint role as assistant professor of physics at Harvard and Research Fellow in Physics of the Harvard Cancer Commission. The Cancer Commission was founded in 1901 and hired Duane to investigate the usage of radium emanations in the treatment of cancer. In 1915 he built Boston's first \"radium cow\" and thousands of patients were treated with the radon-222 generated from it. He published eight papers on the technical details of using radioactive material and X-Rays in the treatment of cancer. In 1917, Harvard created the chair of bio-physics for him.Duane made important contributions to the technical details of measuring X-ray dosage in terms of the ionization of air. He conducted research to determine the structure of matter and on the mechanism of radiation. He developed the Duane-Hunt law, relating the minimum wavelength of X-rays to the threshold voltage of the cathode rays  that excite them; and Duane's hypothesis of quantized translative momentum transfer.In 1925, Arthur Compton demonstrated that the scattering of 130,000-volt X-rays from the first sixteen elements in the periodic table (hydrogen through sulfur) were polarized. Duane spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong. Duane carried out a series of experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found evidence that Compton was correct. In 1924, Duane conceded that this was the case.He served as councillor of the Societe de Physique from 1920 to 1923, as chairman of the division of physical sciences of the National Research Council from 1922 to 1923, as president of the Society for Cancer Research in 1923 and as vice president of section B of the American Association for the Advancement of Science from 1927 to 1928.After his retirement from Harvard in 1934, he was awarded the title professor of biophysics emeritus."

        "content": "Jules \u00c9tienne Joseph Quicherat (13 October 1814 \u2013 8 April 1882) was a French historian and archaeologist.His father, a working cabinet-maker, came from Paray-le-Monial to Paris to support his large family; Quicherat was born there. He was fifteen years younger than his brother Louis, a great Latin scholar and lexicographer, who survived him. Although very poor, he was admitted to the College of Sainte-Barbe, where he received a thorough classical education. He showed his gratitude to this establishment by writing its history in three volumes, published between 1860 and 1864. At the end of his studies he hesitated for some time before deciding what career he would follow, until Jules Michelet put an end to his indecision by inspiring him with a taste for history.\nIn 1835 Quicherat entered the \u00c9cole des Chartes; he left two years later at the head of the college. Once more inspired by the example of Michelet, who had just written an admirable work on Joan of Arc, he published the text of the two trials of Joan, adding much contemporary evidence on her heroism in his Proc\u00e8s de condamnation et de r\u00e9habilitation de Jeanne d'Arc (5 vols. 1841-1849), as well as half a volume of Aper\u00e7us nouveaux sur l'histoire de Jeanne d'Arc, in which it seems that the last word has been said on important points.\nFrom the 15th century he drew other inspirations. In 1844 he published memoirs of the adventures of a brigand, Rodrigue de Villandrando, which gradually grew into a volume full of fresh matter. He wrote full biographies of two chroniclers of Louis XI, one very obscure, Jean Castel, the other, Thomas Basin, bishop of Lisieux, who was, on the contrary, a remarkable politician, prelate and chronicler. Between 1855 and 1859 Quicherat published the works of the latter, most of which were now brought out for the first time. In addition to these he wrote Fragments in\u00e9dits de Georges Chastellain and Lettres, m\u00e9moires et autres documents relatifs \u00e0 la guerre du bien public en 1465.\nThese works did not wholly occupy his time: in 1847 he inaugurated a course of archaeological lectures at the \u00c9cole des Chartes, and in 1849 was appointed professor of diplomatics at the same college. His teaching had exceptionally good results. Although he was not eloquent and had a nasal voice, his hearers were loath to miss any of his thoughtful teaching, which was unbiased and well expressed. Of his lectures the public saw only some articles on special subjects which were distributed in a number of reviews. Note should be made of a short treatise on La Formation fran\u00e7aise des anciens noms de lieu published in 1867; and a memoir De l'ogive et de l'architecture ogivale published in 1850, where he gives his theory on the use of stone arches important for the history of religious architecture. In an 1874 article on L'\u00e2ge de la cath\u00e9drale de Laon, he declared an exact date for the birth of Gothic architecture.\nFollowing the advice of his friends, he began to transcribe towards the end of his life his lectures on archaeology; but only the introductory chapters, up to the 11th century, were found among his papers. On the other hand, the pupils trained by him circulated his principles throughout France, recognizing him as the founder of national archaeology. In one point he seems to have taken a false step; with a warmth and pertinacity worthy of a better cause he maintained the identity of Caesar's Alesia with Alaise, and he died without becoming a convert to the opinion, now almost universally accepted, that Alise Sainte-Reine is the place where Vercingetorix capitulated. But even this error benefited science; some well directed excavations at Alaise brought many Roman remains to light, which were subsequently sent to enrich the museum at Besan\u00e7on.\nAfter 1871, his course of lectures on diplomatics having been given up, Quicherat, still professor of archaeology, was nominated director of the Ecole des Chartes. He filled this post with the same energy which he had shown in the many scientific commissions in which he had taken part. In 1878 he gave up his duties as professor, which then fell to the most conspicuous of his pupils, Robert de Lasteyrie. He died suddenly at Paris on April 8, 1882, a short time after having corrected the proofs of Suppl\u00e9ment aux t\u00e9moignages contemporains de Jeanne d'Arc, published in the Revue Historique.\nAfter his death it was decided to bring out his hitherto unpublished papers; among these are some important fragments of his archaeological lectures, but his Histoire de la laine, with which he was occupied for many years, is missing."

        "content": "Nicholas Rackard (28 April 1922 \u2013 10 April 1976) was an Irish hurler whose league and championship career with the Wexford senior team spanned seventeen years from 1940 to 1957. He established many championship scoring records, including being the top championship goal-scorer of all time with 59 goals. Rackard is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game.Born in Killane, County Wexford, Rackard was introduced to sport by his father who had hoped he would become a cricketer. His uncle, John Doran, won an All-Ireland medal as a Gaelic footballer with Wexford in 1918 and it was hurling and Gaelic football that Rackard developed a talent for.\nRackard played competitive hurling as a boarder at St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny. Here he won back-to-back Leinster medals in 1938 and 1939, however, an All-Ireland medal remained elusive. By this stage Rackard had started playing for the local Rathnure St. Anne's club, winning a county junior championship medal in 1940. As a member of the club's senior team he won four county senior championship medals.\nRackard made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was selected for the Wexford minor panel. He was just out of the minor grade when he was selected for the Wexford senior team in 1940. Over the course of the next seventeen years, Rackard won two All-Ireland medals as part of the Wexford hurling breakthrough in 1955 and 1956. He also won four Leinster medals, one National Hurling League medal and one Leinster medal as a Gaelic footballer. He played his last game for Wexford in August 1957.\nBy the late 1940s, Rackard was a regular in the full-forward line on the Leinster inter-provincial team. Success came in the twilight of his career and he claimed his sole Railway Cup medal in 1956.\nRackard's brothers, Billy and Bobby, also experienced All-Ireland success with Wexford.In retirement from playing Rackard became involved in team management and coaching. It was with the Wexford senior team that he enjoyed his greatest successes as a selector when, in 1968, he helped the team secure the All-Ireland title.\nRackard was most famous for his scoring prowess and was the all-time top championship scorer at the time of his retirement from hurling. His private life was marred by periods of excessive drinking, which had started during his university studies, and eventually developed into alcoholism. After quitting drinking completely in 1970, Rackard travelled the country as a counsellor with Alcoholics Anonymous. In an interview in the Irish Press in 1975, he detailed his life as a recovering alcoholic and became one of the first sportspeople to break the taboo of alcoholism in Ireland. Rackard's death from cancer in April 1976 saw a huge outpouring of grief amongst the hurling community. He was posthumously honoured by being named on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984, however, he was sensationally omitted from the Hurling Team of the Millennium in favour of Ray Cummins."

His parents were Robert (Bob) Rackard and Anastasia Doran, who had been married in 1918. He was born into a family that was mildly interested in sport. His granduncle had played with the famous Wexford football team that captured four All-Ireland titles in-a-row between 1915 and 1918. Rackard's father Bob had planned that his son would play cricket, however, young Rackard was much more interested in Gaelic games. He was educated locally and later attended St. Kierans College, Kilkenny, a virtual academy for young hurling talent. Rackard later attended University College Dublin where he studied to be a veterinary surgeon. In all, his studies took eight years to complete because of his huge commitment to his sporting exploits."

His problems with alcohol began while he was studying to be a veterinary surgeon in Dublin. In 1951 he suddenly gave up alcohol in a pledge not to drink again after a friend, who was a priest, died. When Wexford celebrated All-Ireland success in 1955 and 1956 Rackard was a teetotaller. During a visit to New York in 1957, however, Rackard began drinking again and the habit grew progressively worse over the next 12 years. In 1965, then a serious alcoholic, he had his first period of hospitalisation to treat the illness. At that stage he was drinking daily, however, the treatment didn't work. He finally quit by 1970 after joining Alcoholics Anonymous. When Rackard quit drink for the final time he was practically broke. He pieced his life together again, rebuilt his veterinary practice and indulged his passion for horses, enjoying wins in point-to-points and other major race events.\nWith the AA he travelled the country helping people who were troubled by alcohol. In February 1974 Rackard noticed strange lumps on his neck which he had later removed. Later that year he was told he needed another operation and was said to be making good progress. In 1975 he spoke out in the Irish Press newspaper about his alcoholism, becoming one of the first people to break the taboo of alcoholism in Ireland. Shortly after this it was revealed that the cancer that had previously troubled him had unfortunately not been completely annihilated and had returned. Rackard died at St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin in 1976 and was universally mourned by the GAA community throughout Ireland."

His father was a coal miner, boxer, baseball player, and guitarist, and his mother was a pianist. Barefield began playing the saxophone at the age of twelve. His mother bought him the instrument as a Christmas gift, and he took it apart to see how it worked.He started playing throughout the Midwest, and gained his first major big-band experience with the Bennie Moten orchestra of 1932 (which later metamorphosed into the Count Basie Orchestra). This opportunity led to work with Zach Whyte's band. When he was 24, he was offered a position in Cab Calloway's orchestra in 1933. Barefield arranged and wrote music for Calloway for over 40 years. Barfield conducted the orchestra for Ella Fitzgerald after Chick Webb died in 1939.

As Supervisor, Mills lowered taxes, improved the Town's bond rating, oversaw a landfill closure, three major bridge replacements and a town-wide road improvement program. Mills served for six years in the New York State Assembly after being elected in 1998. He served as the Deputy Minority Leader, sat on the Banking, Housing, Insurance and Ways and Means Committees, and was a member of the Armed Forces Legislative Caucus. He has been described as pro-choice (albeit opposed to \"late term abortions\"), \"pro-Second Amendment\", and a \"moderate\" on social issues.In 2001, three years after Mills left his post as supervisor, state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued the town in federal court, accusing the police department of petty corruption, civil liberties violations, and harassment. The town entered into an agreement with the state, dismissed the police chief, agreed to the appointment of an overseer and accepted a lengthy code of conduct laid out by the state. The police chief, James Coscette, had been appointed by Mills and unanimously confirmed by the Town Board.\nDid we collect specific evidence that this was going on when Howard Mills was supervisor? No, but we didn't need to go that far back. However, having done a lot of these investigations, the kinds of problems that we saw are not the kinds of problems that spring up overnight. They are the kinds of problems that fester for years and years, and so I would be very surprised if these problems had not been going on for many years, back through several administrations, including his."

In 1822, his father died and Downing took over the business, later partnering with his brother, Andrew Jackson Downing, in 1835. The partnership lasted until 1839 when Charles sold his interest to start his own business.As a nurseryman, Downing was known for his cultivation skill and trustworthiness.Published in 1845, he worked with his brother to write The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America. After Andrew's death in 1852, Downing edited and added new material and reissued The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America. Each new edition greatly enlarged the book and it was the best publication of the kind in the United States.In 1850, he left his nursery and began to research and experiment with fruit varieties. His test orchard contained 1,800 varieties of apples and 1,000 varieties of pears. He also worked with cultivating a variety of grapes in New York state.He was regarded as one of the foremost pomologists of his day. He also wrote many articles upon horticultural subjects under the initials \"C. D.\" His work throughout was conscientious and accurate, and he was internationally recognized as an authority upon pomology, horticulture, and tree growths. Quiet, modest, and retiring, although an active member of horticultural societies, he would never make a public speech.In 1870, Downing traveled with Marshall P. Wilder, Patrick Barry, and George Ellwanger to California and published about their journey in Tilton's Journal. The California Farmer and Journal of Useful Sciences printed their report in seven articles.Their report transformed the horticultural landscape through the realization of the optimal growing conditions, vast acreage, large fruits, and exotic plants of California."

        "content": "His grandfather and father were dealers in second-hand books. In 1834 he went to Vienna, where he devoted himself to literary work, and wrote the drama Die Letzte Weisse Rose, which was played first in Stuttgart and later in Carlsruhe and Frankfort-on-the-Main, and won great popularity. In 1838 Kuranda went to Stuttgart, where he became acquainted with David Strauss, the author of Das Leben Jesu; with Uhland, and with other Swabian poets. Here, too, for the first time he came into contact with public political life. He then went to Paris and Brussels. In the latter city he attracted attention through lectures on modern German literature. With the assistance of Minister Nothomb and the author Hendrik Conscience he founded in 1841 the periodical Die Grenzboten; but on account of the obstacles which the Prussian government placed in the way of its circulation in Germany, Kuranda removed its headquarters to Leipzig, where it soon became an important factor in Austrian politics. That which no one dared write in Austria was published in Die Grenzboten. Kuranda's work Belgien Seit Seiner Revolution appeared in Leipzig in 1846.\nAfter the outbreak of the movement of 1848 Kuranda went to Vienna, where he was enthusiastically received in literary circles. From Vienna he was delegated to the F\u00fcnfziger Ausschuss in Frankfort-on-the-Main, and later he was returned to the German parliament as delegate for Teplitz. Kuranda did not remain long in the Frankfort parliament. In the summer of 1848 he returned to Vienna and established the Ostdeutsche Post, which first appeared on 1 October, and in which he strove to oppose the revolutionary element. After the promulgation of the constitution (the Octroirte Verfassung), which had been forced upon the people, Kuranda had to give up his position as editor of the Ostdeutsche Post. He was placed under police surveillance because he refused to sign an engagement not to write upon politics, and some time elapsed before he could again publish the periodical, which he made the organ of the so-called \"Grossdeutsche\" liberal party in Austria, and in which he pleaded for the restoration of constitutional conditions.\nKuranda may be regarded as one of the founders of liberal press conditions in Austria. Memorable is his lawsuit with Sebastian Brunner, a Catholic priest and editor of the Kirchenzeitung, which case was tried on 10 May 1860. Kuranda had pointed out in the Oesterreichische Post that Brunner collected material for his accusations against the Jews \"from very unclean and suspicious sources, whereby he spread untruthfulness and slander.\" Brunner pressed a charge of calumny against Kuranda, who, through his able defense, and after a masterful pleading by Johann Berger , was acquitted in terms which implied a condemnation of Brunner's anti-Jewish campaign.\nIn 1866 Kuranda discontinued the publication of his paper, and devoted all his energies to politics. He fought the absolutist October policy, and assisted, as friend and confidant, the Austrian secretary of state, Schmerling, in drafting the February constitution."

On the creation of the Delegations (a kind of common parliament of Hungary and Austria with alternative seats at Budapest and Vienna) he was returned as a member of that body. One of the most distinguished members of parliament, Kuranda was a brilliant orator, and spoke mostly on questions of foreign politics. He was also for many years a member of the city council of Vienna.\nIn 1881 Kuranda's seventieth birthday was celebrated with great enthusiasm by his political party and by the press; and the city council made him an honorary citizen. The emperor had already in 1867 honored him with the Ritterkreuz des Leopoldordens. Kuranda's great activity as a politician and publicist, which he exercised for twenty-three years as the leader of the German liberal party, was paralleled by his faithful devotion to the Jewish cause, to which he gave a great part of his powers. He was for twelve years president of the Jewish community of Vienna. As vice-president of the Israelitische Allianz zu Wien he promoted the study of Wissenschaft des Judentums (Jewish science and history) in which he took great interest."

His ideas of the mneme (based on the Greek goddess, Mneme, the muse of memory) were developed early in the 20th century.  The mneme represented the memory of an external-to-internal experience.  The resulting \"mnemic trace\" (or \"engram\") would be revived when an element resembling a component of the original complex of stimuli was encountered. Semon\u2019s mnemic principle was based upon how stimuli produce a \"permanent record,... written or engraved on the irritable substance\", i.e. upon cellular material energetically predisposed to such inscription. According to historian Petteri Pietikainen:\n\nSemon argued not only that information is encoded into memory and that there are 'memory traces' (engrams) or after-effects of stimulation that conserve the changes in the nervous system, he also contended that these changes in the brain (that is, engrams) are inherited. Semon's mneme-theory fell into disrepute largely because in a Lamarckian fashion it proposed that memory units are passed from one generation to another.\nSemon was a proponent of the theory of organic memory, which was popular amongst biologists and psychologists from 1870 to 1918. The theory later lost scientific legitimacy as it yielded no reliable data and advances in genetics made the theory untenable."

N.B.: Semon's Mneme should not be confused with meme, a separate concept coined by Richard Dawkins. Despite Dawkins having coined 'meme' distinctly from mneme, that has not stopped Dawkins' contemporaries from comparing the concepts for being remarkably similar. David Hull, a philosopher of biology, argued that meme and mneme are parallel concepts of which Dawkins inadvertently provided the first development of since Semon.

        "content": "Agnes Bertha Marshall (born Agnes Beere Smith; 24 August 1852 \u2013 29 July 1905) was an English culinary entrepreneur, inventor, and celebrity chef. An unusually prominent businesswoman for her time, Marshall was particularly known for her work on ice cream and other frozen desserts, which in Victorian England earned her the moniker \"Queen of Ices\". Marshall popularised ice cream in England and elsewhere at a time when it was still a novelty and is often regarded as the inventor of the modern ice cream cone. Through her work, Marshall may be largely responsible for both the look and popularity of ice cream today.She began her career in 1883 through the founding of the Marshall's School of Cookery, which taught high-end English and French cuisine and grew to be a renowned culinary school. She wrote four well-received cookbooks, two of which were devoted to ice cream and other desserts. Together with her husband Alfred, Marshall operated a variety of different businesses. From 1886 onward, she published her own magazine, The Table, which included weekly recipes and at times articles written by Marshall on various topics, both serious and frivolous. \nAlthough she was one of the most celebrated cooks of her time and one of the foremost cookery writers of the Victorian age, Marshall rapidly faded into obscurity after her death and was largely forgotten.   However, technology invented or conceptualised by Marshall, including her ice cream freezer and the idea of creating ice cream with the use of liquid nitrogen, have since become repopularised."

        "content": "For years it was believed that Agnes Bertha Smith was born on 24 August 1855 in Walthamstow, Essex, and was the daughter of John Smith, who worked as a clerk, and his wife Susan.Recent research has discovered that she was three years older than she claimed; and her birth certificate shows that she was in fact born on 24 August 1852 in Haggerston, in the East End of London, as Agnes Beere Smith, the illegitimate daughter of Susan Smith. Her birth was registered in the customary fashion for illegitimate births under her mother's surname, and giving the father's name, 'Beere', as an extra forename. She was raised by her maternal grandmother, Sarah Smith, in Walthamstow, and can be found living there in the 1861 census.Her mother Susan then had three further illegitimate children with a man named Charles Wells: Mary Sarah Wells Smith (1859), John Osborn Wells Smith (1863) and Ada Martha Wells Smith (1868). Susan and Charles Wells were married in 1869, and the children thereafter discarded the surname Smith.Nothing is known of how, where or when she learned to cook. According to a later article in the Pall Mall Gazette, she had \"made a thorough study of cookery since she was a child, and has practiced at Paris and with Vienna's celebrated chefs\". In the preface to her first book, Marshall wrote that she had received \"practical training and lessons, through several years, from leading English and Continental authorities\". This seems unlikely, coming from a poor background in the East End of London, and the 1878 birth certificate for her daughter Ethel describes her as a domestic servant. She is probably the eighteen year-old, born in Walthamstow, working as a kitchen maid in Ayot St Lawrence, Herts., in the 1871 census.In April 1878, \"Agnes Beer [sic] Smith\", domestic servant, gave birth to a daughter, Ethel Doyle Smith, in Dalston and the birth certificate indicates that the father's name was Doyle, and not, as generally assumed, her future husband. A few months later, on 17 August 1878, she married Alfred William Marshall, son of a builder named Thomas Marshall, at St. George's Church, Hanover Square. The couple had three children: Agnes Alfreda (called \"Aggie\", born 1879), Alfred Harold (born 1880), and William Edward born 1882). Daughter Ethel was raised as one of the family; and at some date Agnes changed her second forename to Bertha."

        "content": "In 1904, Marshall fell from a horse and suffered injuries from which she never properly recovered. She died of cancer the next year, on 29 July 1905, at The Towers, Pinner. The Towers was a large estate purchased and refurbished by Marshall in 1891. Marshall was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium and her ashes were interred at the Paines Lane Cemetery in Pinner. Alfred remarried within a year of her death to Gertrude Walsh, a former secretary that Marshall had previously fired. The two had likely been engaged in an affair before Marshall's death. Their son Alfred died in 1907 and his ashes were interred next to Marshall's. The elder Alfred died in 1917 in Nice during World War I; his ashes were at his request also interred next to Marshall's in 1920.Marshall was one of the most celebrated cooks of her time and one of the foremost cookery writers of the Victorian age, particularly on ice cream. Her recipes were renowned for their detail, simplicity and accuracy. For her work on ice cream and other frozen desserts, Marshall in her lifetime earned the nickname \"Queen of Ices\". Only a single book on ice cream is known from England before Marshall's work and she helped popularise ice cream at a time when the concept was still novel in England and elsewhere, particularly through the portable ice cream freezer and the ice cream cone. Before Marshall's writings and innovations, ice cream was often sold frozen to metal rods which had to be returned after all had been licked off and was mainly enjoyed by just the upper classes. She increased the popularity of ice cream to such an extent that she was credited for causing an increase in ice imports from Norway. In 1901, she became the first person known to have suggested the use of liquid nitrogen to freeze ice cream (and the first to suggest using liquified gas on food in general). Marshall imagined this would be the ideal method to make ice cream since the ice cream could be created in seconds and the ice crystals resulting from this method would be tiny, as desired.Despite her fame in life, Marshall's reputation declined rapidly after her death and her name faded into obscurity. Her husband continued to operate their businesses but they declined without Marshall's personality and drive. In 1921, the company was sold and became a limited company and in 1954 it ceased operations. Marshall's cookery school remained in operation until the outbreak of World War II. The Table also continued to be published to around the same time. The rights to her books were sold off to the publishing house Ward Lock at some time in 1927 or 1928, though Ward Lock had little interest in keeping them in print. In the 1950s, a fire destroyed much of Marshall's personal papers which further pushed her into obscurity.More recently, from the late 20th century onwards, Marshall's reputation has been restored as one of the most prominent cooks of the Victorian age. The cookery writer Elizabeth David referred to her as the \"famous Mrs Marshall\" in the posthumously published Harvest of the Cold Months (1994) and the author Robin Weir declared her to have been \"the greatest Victorian ice cream maker\" in a 1998 biographical study. Weir assessed Marshall in 2015 as a \"unique one-woman industry\" whose achievements were \"arguably unequalled\" and who \"deserves much more credit than she has been given by history\". Since the late 20th century, Marshall's books have once more been reprinted and ice cream freezers based on her original designs are once again in commercial use. Using liquid nitrogen to freeze ice cream has also become an increasingly popular trend. A liquid nitrogen ice cream store that was inspired by Marshall's proposed technique was opened in 2014 in St. Louis, Missouri and named \"Ices Plain & Fancy\" after her book.\n\n\n== References =="

He then illegally crossed the border to Norway in a boat and met with Norwegian reporters. While wearing Nazi symbols, he told the reporters that he was \"not a nationalist, but a racist\". Joined by two neo-Nazis from \"an ex-Soviet Baltic state\" living in Norway, he appeared at the International Police Immigration Service in Oslo on 21 September 2010, where he handed in a loaded weapon, declared himself a \"white warrior\" and requested political asylum. As a result, the police searched their tattoo shop where they found five illegal handguns and an entrance card stolen from the Norwegian Armed Forces. Nazi paraphernalia including a large doll dressed up as a Nazi was found near the front entrance of the shop. The newspaper interviewed residents near the tattoo shop who claimed they 'often heard loud noise, screaming and banging'. The neighbors also stated they would occasionally see the occupants of the tattoo shop 'practicing fighting and boxing while completely naked'. All three were then jailed, while the case is being investigated. On 18 October Russian authorities sent an extradition request to Norwegian authorities.In the week of 29 October, a Norwegian police physician submitted a report based on conversations with Datsik and review of available documents which concluded that he did not have a serious mental disease. Datsik's lawyers are of the opinion that Russian authorities made up the psychiatric diagnosis and that Norwegian authorities on that ground must allow Datsik to remain in Norway. Datsik also claims that he was tortured by Russian authorities. The torture included the application of electrodes to his genitals and placing him in an iron cage for eight months, naked and handcuffed. He has twice attempted suicide in Norwegian detainment due to being isolated from the other prisoners, but he was again isolated after shouting racist remarks from his cell window. Datsik had been placed in solitary confinement for four weeks despite the court's order being limited to one week. Norwegian police blamed capacity issues for this. The Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet writes that Datsik has allegedly told the police that he wants his girlfriend to come to Norway for family reunification.He has since asked the court to give him the maximum sentence, as he has said that it would help him live a healthier life, while announcing that he is \"too raw for humanity\". He has told the Norwegian media that he wants to compete in mixed martial arts under the flag of Norway. Russia has sought the extradition of Datsik. On 22 December 2010, a demonstration was held by his followers in Oslo. Viacheslav Datsik was deported from Norway on 18 March 2011. In December 2011, rumours surfaced from Russia, that Datsik had been killed in a prison fight. However Alexander Zubov, Head of Press Service of the Federal Penitentiary Service management for the St. Petersburg and Leningrad region, dismissed the reports, claiming that Datsik is well and healthy."

        "content": "He was born in 1756 in Seoul. His father was Soam Yi Dong-uk (\u8607\u5dd6 \u674e\u6771\u90c1, 1739-?) from the Pyeongchang clan, who rose to the rank of champan (vice-minister) and, after possible initial interest, fiercely opposed the spread of Catholic teachings. His mother was a sister of Yi Ga-hwan (\u674e\u5bb6\u7165, 1742\u20131801), one of the Catholics executed with him in 1801.\nYi Seung-hun first came into contact with Catholicism via Yi Byeok in 1779. In 1783\u20134, he accompanied his father on a diplomatic mission to Beijing, China, and on the suggestion of Yi Byeok contacted the Catholic priests there. He was baptised in Beijing in the spring of 1784. This was the first time that a member of the Korean yangban class was formally baptised as a Christian and he returned to Korea with books, crucifixes, and other Catholic artifacts. Yi Byeok then seems to have taken some time to study the books before declaring himself convinced. He then set about evangelizing those around him, including Gwon Cheol-sin and his younger brother Gwon Il-sin. This was also the moment when he spoke of the Catholic faith to the brothers Jeong Yak-jong, Jeong Yak-jeon, and Jeong Yak-Yong (who recorded the event in his epitaph myojimyeong.It was only after Yi Byeok felt fully convinced that he authorized Yi Seung-hun to baptise himself and the other converts to Catholicism. Early in 1785 the growing group of believers and sympathizers in Seoul moved their regular gatherings for worship from the house of Yi Byeok to that belonging to another convert, Kim Beom-u, on the hill where Myeongdong Cathedral now stands. Almost immediately the authorities raided the house, suspecting it of being a gambling den, and were embarrassed on finding it full of nobles. Yi Seung-hun was among those named in the official report of the incident. After the death of Yi Byeok later that year, Yi Seung-hun took over his role in the group. In the spring of 1786, as there were yet no formally ordained priests in Korea, Various leading Korean laymen, including Choi Chang-Hyon, Yi Tan-won, began acting as \"temporary clerics\". In 1789, however, the Korean Catholics were informed by the bishop in Beijing, Mgr. Gouvea, that such practices were contrary to Church teachings and that they should cease. There would be no ordained priest in Korea until 1795, when the Chinese priest Zhu Wenmiao arrived, at which time the Church had grown to over 4000 members. Yi Seung-hun and Jeong Yak-jong were the main leaders of the community in Seoul after the death of Yi Byeok in 1786. Yi Seung-hun's wife was Jeong Yak-jong's sister.\nIn 1801, the Korean Catholic Church was subject to the first major repression by the government (the Sinyu Persecution) in which more than 300 people were killed. Yi was martyred by beheading on the 26th of the 2nd lunar month (April 8), 1801. This incident has come to be known as the Catholic Persecution of 1801. Little written material remains from this period but a collection of texts by several of the first believers, known as Mancheon yugo (\u8513\u5ddd\u907a\u7a3f), was discovered in about 1970. Mancheon was the ho of Yi Seung-hun, whose writings occupy a major part of the book, together with texts written by Yi Byeok etc. It is not known when or by whom the collection was made, and although it is sometimes claimed to be in the handwriting of Jeong Yak-yong, this does not seem to be the case."

His mother, Johanna (n\u00e9e Reininghaus), was the daughter of Zoe von Karajan, a distant relative of Herbert von Karajan and wife of Carl Reininghaus. Gollob was the first of five children. Both his parents had studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where they mutually befriended Gordon Mallet McCouch, an American artist of Scottish descent. McCouch was his godfather and the namesake for his first name, Gordon. Max was his middle name, not Mac, but because of McCouch, he was called \"Mac\". In his youth, Gollob already wanted to become an engineer and pilot. In 1930, as a student at an Oberrealschule, a secondary school, he built his first primary glider in Tirol, experimenting with it at the old airfield at Innsbruck. He also completed his A- and B-license to fly glider aircraft and became an instructor as well as a construction and airframe inspector.\nFollowing four semesters of mechanical engineering at the University of Graz, Gollob joined the Austrian Armed Forces in 1933 as an officer cadet in the artillery. For three years he was trained at the Theresian Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt and was promoted to Leutnant (second lieutenant) on 1 September 1936. He then served as an instructor in the Austrian Air Force and commander of Schulstaffel A (Training Squadron A). Following the Anschluss in March 1938, the forced incorporation of Austria into Nazi Germany, Gollob was transferred to the Luftwaffe (the Nazi German Air Force).

From 1616 he was capell\u00e1n for Francisco G\u00f3mez de Sandoval y Rojas, 1st Duke of Lerma, the favourite of Philip III of Spain.

In 1628 he was succeeded as maestro de capilla of the Royal Convent of La Encarnaci\u00f3n in Madrid by Carlos Pati\u00f1o who was then, five years later in 1634, chosen ahead of D\u00edaz Bess\u00f3n to succeed the Flemish-born Mateo Romero as the first Spanish-born maestro of the Flemish chapel (capilla flamenca). D\u00edaz Bess\u00f3n died four years later in Madrid.\nD\u00edaz Bess\u00f3n \"wrote music that was apostrophised as 'celestial'\". D\u00edaz Bess\u00f3n composed in all the major genres: masses, requiem, motets, psalms, antiphons, hymns, tonos humanos, villancicos. In all more than 700 compositions were recorded, almost all of which were lost in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, as well as writing theoretical works."

Recently his teammate and friend Sunil Chhetri told the media that Renedy is the best midfielder in the country but also the most under-rated and  unnoticed Indian footballer. Renedy and Sunil Chetri were prominent figures in JCT FC squad, they  helped  JCT FC finish second and third in National Football League 2006-2007 and I-League 2007\u201308. He has his roots to Sekmai, a well known Football hub.\nHe is India's very own dead-ball specialist and one of the most experienced members of the 2011 Asian Cup squad.\nLike many other current Indian internationals, Renedy is a graduate of the famous Tata Football Academy in Jamshedpur. He spent six years there before signing his first professional contract with East Bengal in 1997. Renedy's performances from midfield with the red and gold brigade earned him his first senior international cap in 98, when he was only 19.\n\nBy 2000, Renedy established himself as one of the best freekick takers in the country and was signed by Mohun Bagan. Arguably the best stage of his career was with the Mariners as he played an influential role during their 2001-02 National League triumph. Renedy's ability to cross the ball with both feet made him a mainstay in the India national team, especially after his excellent displays in India's 2002 LG Cup success.\nInjuries saw a dip in his form and he incredibly joined Chirag United, then known was Everyday and were not in the top flight, in 2004 after leaving Bagan. However he continued to do well for the Indian team and was actually top scorer in India's dismal 2006 World Cup qualification campaign with two goals. Renedy's club career got revived after he joined JCT in 2005 as he helped the Phagwara-based club finish second in the National League in the 06\u201307 season.\nRenedy joined  East Bengal for the second time in his career in 2008 but was never a regular there because of injuries and lack of match fitness. He did however star in a couple of big Kolkata derbies by providing assists with his superb delivery from set pieces. Renedy has been a key member of the Indian team during Bob Houghton's tenure but since the 2009 Nehru Cup he has not been a regular in the first eleven because of the problems he has had with injury. His best individual moment so far in the Bob Houghton era was without the doubt the delightful curling freekick he scored against Syria in the 2009 Nehru Cup final.\nAfter having a forgettable 2010 season with East Bengal, he was released by the club. He continued to be a regular in the India national football team and showed some skill which made people remember what he is capable of. After representing India in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, he agreed a contract with Baichung Bhutia's own club United Sikkim FC in the I-League 2nd Division.\nOn 16 January 2011, Singh had officially signed for Shillong Lajong of the I-League. In 2012, Singh went on to attend trial with Norwegian Eliteserien club Troms\u00f8 IL.On 27 February 2015, he joined Bulgarian side CSKA Sofia on loan from Kerala Blasters, being the first Indian to sign for a Bulgarian club. However, he did not make any official appearances for the team, which was facing serious financial difficulties at the time."

He was a key player in arranging the merger of twenty-six large foundries to form the American Type Founders Company in 1892, becoming both manager of the Boston branch and head of the design department, where he oversaw the consolidation of type faces following the merger.  Though his own designs were largely derivative, Phinney took a great interest in type and its history and throughout his tenure at A.T.F. he sought to preserve and protect that company's legacy, as for instance, when he oversaw the re-introduction of Binny & Ronaldson's 1796 type design, Roman No. 1, as Oxford in 1892, or when he purchased Frederick W. Goudy's first type design, Camelot, in 1896.  He stayed with A.T.F. for the rest of his career, passing the role of design head to Morris Fuller Benton and becoming senior vice-president.

Following the death of her father, she traveled to New York to spend the summer with her other aunt. At the age of fourteen, she was discovered singing from the fire escape of her aunt's apartment by the composer Will Marion Cook and lyricist Paul Laurence Dunbar; they cast her for a role in their one-act musical comedy Clorindy: The Origin of the Cakewalk (1898). It was so successful that it ran for the whole season at the Casino Roof Garden.Mitchell married Cook a year later, and appeared in the lead role in his Jes Lak White Folks (1899). She also appeared in his production The Southerners (1904). Cook and Mitchell had a daughter, Marion Abigail Cook, in 1900, and a son, Will Mercer Cook, in 1903.In London, Mitchell appeared in the 1903 musical In Dahomey, produced by the team of George Walker and Bert Williams, with music composed by her husband Cook, book by J.A. Shipp, and lyrics by poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. The cakewalk, considered old-fashioned by the cast, was almost cut from the show, but proved popular with audiences. It became a fad in the United Kingdom. Mitchell received international acclaim for her performance, and at age 17 she was invited to appear with the company in a Royal Command Performance for King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra at Buckingham Palace.\nMitchell later performed with the \"Black Patti's Troubadours\", and in the operetta The Red Moon (1908) by Bob Cole and J. Rosamond Johnson. In 1913, she appeared in the film Lime Kiln Field Day with Bert Williams, which was produced by Klaw and Erlanger, but they never finished or released it.

In 2003, Frostenson was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in France in recognition of her services to literature.Frostenson is one of Sweden's foremost poets, whose style unites experimental, traditional and archaic elements with a preoccupation with the materiality of language. She has published over two dozen books, primarily poetry. Debuting in 1978 with I mellan (In-Between), she rose to critical acclaim with her collections in the 1980s and 1990s, including Den andra (The Other, 1982), I det gula (In the Yellow, 1985) and Joner (Ions, 1991), which is often seen as one of the most notable collections of Swedish poetry in the twentieth century. She has also written as a dramatist and as a translator from French.

        "content": "Katarina Frostenson's work is frequently described as performing a kind of linguistic skepticism (the belief that language is perpetually insufficient to represent reality or contain any essential truth), and as isolating the paradox of using language as the means of its own critique or deconstruction. These limits of language in calling forth reality and experience is also one of the main themes of Katarina Frostenson's work. Her poetry attempts to bring forth experience rather than describe it. In her poetry collections, Frostenson combines shorter poems and longer narrative poems, often with a sense of fragmentation that attempt to convey images or emotions of a specific moment.Along with a group of other Swedish women poets emerging in the 1980s such as Ann J\u00e4derlund and Birgitta Lillpers, Frostenson's work evinces an attempt to communicate outside of a realm dominated by male writers, focusing on sounds and image rather than a united logos and coherent semantics. Frostenson's poetry stands out in Swedish literary history for its radical linguistic experimentation through a blend of the archaic and the avant-garde; its focus on the intricate sonic qualities of the Swedish language; its references to classical mythology, folksongs, ballads, and canonical Western literary and philosophical figures; and its general lack of metaphor and descriptive language. Her work is orientated towards drawing attention to the material elements of language, that is, sounds, while also being attuned to, playing with, and deconstructing the semantic elements formed out of the phonetic building blocks in search of a purer, authentic or genuine kind of language.One could say that Frostenson attempts to eliminate all barriers which disrupt emotional and sensory communication. The experience of language's shortcomings is more authentic than its inability to communicate truth. Rather than relying on metaphors and complex attempts at reproducing in language the complexities of human experience, Frostenson's poetry instead gathers fragments of images, emotions, and sounds. Often, each image or feeling appears with an unexpected opposition, creating a dissonance of meaning. For Frostenson, the human senses are more faithful to experience and thus more trustworthy than language as a means of communication.Frostenson's oeuvre is one of the most influential in Swedish literature. Known first and foremost as a poet, she has published fourteen collections of poetry as well as several works of prose, drama, (creative) nonfiction, translations from French, as well as the libretto for Sven-David Sandstr\u00f6m\u2019s opera Staden (The City, 1998). In addition to being nominated for Sweden\u2019s largest literary prize, the August Prize, three times (for Joner in 1991, for Tal och regn [Speech and Rain] in 2008, and for Tre v\u00e4gar [Three Paths] in 2013), Frostenson has won nearly all the poetry prizes in Sweden and in 2016 was awarded the Nordic Council Literature Prize for her 2015 collection S\u00e5nger och formler (Songs and Formulae). She was made a knight of the French Legion of Honor in 2003. Her work has been translated into over ten languages, most notably to French, German, and Italian."

The club received funding from the Swedish Academy, which sparked allegations of conflicts of interest. Thus in 2018, Frostenson was accused of corruption contemporaneous with the accusations of sexual assault and corruption leveled against Arnault. Frostenson was also accused of having leaked names of Nobel Prize laureates to Arnault before they were announced. However, it was discovered that it was commonplace for family members of Academy members to know who was receiving the prize ahead of announcement, according to Ebba Witt-Brattstr\u00f6m, ex-wife of Academy member Horace Engdahl. The Academy ultimately decided against expelling Frostenson, which prompted the resignation of three academy members. Frostenson protested that she should not be punished for the wrongdoings of her husband. Nevertheless, she did ultimately and voluntarily withdraw from the academy receiving a lifelong compensation of 12,875 Swedish kronor per month and the right to continue to live in an apartment owned by the Academy."

When Banks failed to make it big-time, he moved on to his third career as a director of plays. He started his first studio and held auditions. One of his memories was of a girl singing. \"She's terrible\", he commented, not knowing that this girl was Barbra Streisand. He also ran through many small jobs such as salad-maker, dishwasher, short-order cook, and theater usher. Finally his string of jobs ended when he tried to be a salesman at a Colony record shop. His simple and short statement on the incident that changed his life was, \"I had a fight and lost.\" While the original argument was trivial, Banks exploded and while he was obviously the smaller opponent, he fought ferociously. In the end, it took six policemen to drag him away from the fight. \nBanks then studied karate under John Slocum. After 10 lessons, his drug and alcohol use ceased. He trained under multiple teachers and learned many different techniques. Within four years, Banks earned his black belt in Goju Ryu."

        "content": "While Baum may have written about it, there are no surviving notes for the composition of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The lack of this information has resulted in speculation of the term origins he used in the book, which include the word Munchkin. Baum researcher Brian Attebery has hypothesized that there might be a connection to the M\u00fcnchner Kindl, the emblem of the Bavarian city of Munich (spelled M\u00fcnchen in German). The symbol was originally a 13th-century statue of a monk, looking down from the town hall in Munich. Over the years, the image was reproduced many times, for instance as a figure on beer steins, and eventually evolved into a child wearing a pointed hood. Baum's family had German origins, suggesting that Baum could have seen one such reproduction in his childhood. It is also possible that Munchkin came from the German word M\u00e4nnchen, which means \"mannikin\" or \"little figure\". In 1900, Baum published a book about window displays in which he stressed the importance of mannequins in attracting customers. Another possibility is a connection to Baron Munchausen. This fictional character is based on a real baron who told outrageous tall tales based on his military career. Like the other Oz terms, the word Munchkin ends in a diminutive which in this case refers to the size of the natives."

The awards are in the forms of money, laptops, refrigerators and scholarships up to PhD level studies.In October 2017, Global Communities partnered with the Foundation to start up the Youth Inclusive Entrepreneurial Development Initiative for Employment (YIEDIE) project.

The project operates in Ghana's five largest cities: Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Ashaiman, and Tema and will provide opportunities for at least 23,700 youth, between ages 17\u201324, who earn less than $2 per day.In November 2017, 4,946 children from eight districts in the Ashanti, Ahafo, Bono and Bono East Regions (Sekyere North, Bekwai Municipality, Atwima Mponua, Bibaini-Anwhiaso-Bekwai, Bosomtwe, Offinso Municipality, New Edubaise and Goaso district) were given free computer training. This was done by a collaboration between Otumfuo-Agroecom Mobile Library Project (OAMLP), which is a subsidiary of the Otumfuo Charity Foundation, and Agroecom Ghana Ltd, a cocoa buying company. This initiative is in line with its aim to bridge the gap in learning conditions between the urban and less privileged communities and instill reading and the use of ICT in pupils at the basic level.In January 2019, an agreement was entered into by the Foundation and Young Educators Foundation who are the organizers of the ''Spelling Bee\" competition. This was geared towards making the literary programs of the Young Educators Foundation available to less privileged communities and public schools in the Ashanti Region. This would give 100 students the opportunity to benefit from the program every year.In May 2020, junior high school students in Kumasi received over 2000 books and dictionaries. Some of the communities that benefited from this gesture were Bohyen, Aduato, Adumanu, Ampabame and South Suntreso. This was aimed at keeping students academically active while schools were closed to control the spread of COVID-19.In June 2020, the Foundation donated books to about 750 Junior High School students from 11 basic schools in the Ahafo Region of Ghana. This was to facilitate the excellent performance of the students, especially in the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE).In July 2020, AngloGold Ashanti teamed up with the Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Charity Foundation and the Obuasi Municipal and East Educational Directorates to roll out a Live Radio and Distance Learning Programme in Obuasi. This was to ensure continuation in learning, even though schools had been closed down to control COVID-19. The Foundation was supported by the mine with an amount of 150,000 Ghana Cedis (GH\u20b5) for the purchase and distribution of 10,000 copies of Readers and Workbooks to Junior High School Students in the catchment area.In March 2021, the name of the foundation was changed to Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Foundation(OOTIIF). This come about as a result of the Otumfuo Education Fund, the Serwaa Ampem Foundation for Children and the Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Charity Foundation being merged into one charity with a new board of trustees and management. The new board was constituted of Nana Prof. Oheneba Boachie-Adjei Woahene II as the chair and Sir Samuel Esson Jonah, Dr. Kwaku Mensa-Bonsu, Mrs. Margaret Boateng Sekyere, Dr. Kwame Bawuah-Edusei, Rev. Akua Ofori-Boateng, Mr. Andrew Asamoah, Nana Akuoku Boateng and Mrs. Mariam Agyeman Gyasi Jawhary."

Born into the Roman Catholic society of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Matthias entered the Faculty of Theology in Olomouc after finishing his earlier education. He was subsequently ordained a priest. During his studies, he was interested in the mission of Cyril and Methodius and of Eastern Orthodoxy.\nEstablishment of Czechoslovakia in the aftermath of the First World War brought complete religious freedom. In this environment, many people left the Catholic Church. While many left the religion completely, some looked either to old Czech Protestant churches or, as Pavl\u00edk, to Eastern Orthodoxy. The Serbian Orthodox Church provided a shelter for those looking to Orthodoxy. As a leader in Moravia, the Serbian Orthodox Church agreed to consecrate Pavl\u00edk to the episcopate for his homeland. On 24 September 1921, he was consecrated bishop with the name of Gorazd.\nHistorically, his monastic name of Gorazd was significant as it was the name of the bishop who succeeded Methodius as Bishop of Moravia after he died in 885. Subsequently, Pope Stephen V drove the disciples of Methodius from Moravia as the Latin rite was imposed. Thus, by the choice of his monastic name of Gorazd, the continuity of the Orthodox Church in Moravia from some 1,100 years before was recognized.\nArchimandrite Gorazd was named Bishop of Moravia and Silesia on 24 September 1921, and consecrated bishop on the next day at the Cathedral of the Holy Archangel Michael in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, by Serbian Patriarch Dimitrije.\nOver the next decade or so, Gorazd and his faithful followers organized parishes and built churches in Bohemia. In all they built eleven churches and two chapels. He had the essential service books translated and published in Czech, which was the language used in the church services. With Carpathian Ruthenia and Slovakia part of Czechoslovakia, he assisted many who had returned to their ancestral Eastern Orthodox faith, thus helping the creation of the Eparchy of Muka\u010devo and Pre\u0161ov in 1931.\nWith the conquest of Czechoslovakia by the Nazis in 1938, the church was placed under the Metropolitan in Berlin, Germany. Reinhard Heydrich was appointed as ruler of Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. On 27 May 1942, a group of Czech resistance fighters assassinated Heydrich. In making their escape, the group found refuge in the crypt of the Cathedral. When Gorazd found out a few days later, he recognized the serious burden this placed on the Czech Orthodox Church. Before he left for the consecration to the episcopate of John Gardner in Berlin, he asked that the resistance fighters move elsewhere as soon as possible. However, on June 18, the Nazis found the hiding places after a betrayal by a member of the resistance group, and all the resistance fighters hiding in the church were killed in a Nazi raid.\nReprisals came quickly. The two priests and the senior lay church officials were arrested. Gorazd, wishing to help his fellow believers and the Czech Church itself, took the blame for the actions in the Cathedral on himself, even writing letters to the Nazi authorities. On 27 June 1942, he was arrested and tortured. On 4 September 1942, Gorazd, the Cathedral priests and the lay officials were executed by firing squad at Kobylisy Shooting Range. His body was disposed of at Stra\u0161nice Crematorium.The reprisals went much further as the Nazis conducted widespread roundups of Czechs, including the whole village of Lidice, then summarily killed the men and children, while they placed the women in concentration camps. The Orthodox churches in Moravia and Bohemia were closed and the church forbidden to operate. Metropolitan Seraphim courageously refused to issue any statement condemning Bishop Gorazd. It was not until the end of the war that the Orthodox Church in Czechoslovakia would function again."

Welensky had assumed the leadership of the opposition UFP (which he renamed the Rhodesia Party), and was contesting a by-election in Arundel, but Dupont deliberately resigned his constituency in Charter to oppose him.

When Smith issued the Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965, Dupont was the second signatory to the UDI document.\nSmith's government initially continued to profess loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II. Accordingly, it continued to recognise Elizabeth as head of state, with oaths of allegiance to \"Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth, Queen of Rhodesia, her heirs and successors\". At the same time, Smith's government ceased to recognise the authority of her de jure representative, the Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs. When Gibbs formally dismissed Smith and his entire cabinet on orders from Whitehall, Smith maintained that Gibbs' reserve power to sack the government no longer existed. Instead, on 17 November, it appointed Dupont to the post of \"Acting Officer Administering the Government\".Opponents of UDI who considered it an illegal move, such as the independent member of the Legislative Assembly Ahrn Palley, refused to recognise Dupont's office, and walked out of the opening of Parliament when Dupont came to deliver the Speech from the Throne.On 2 December 1965, Smith wrote a personal letter to the Queen asking her to accept Dupont as Governor-General of Rhodesia. In response, Buckingham Palace replied, \"Her Majesty is not able to entertain purported advice of this kind, and has therefore been pleased to direct that no action shall be taken upon it\". Smith was attempting to assert his claimed prerogatives as Her Majesty's Rhodesian prime minister. However, the UK, with the near-unanimous support of the international community, maintained that Gibbs was the Queen's only legitimate representative in what it still considered to be the colony of Southern Rhodesia, and hence the only lawful authority in the area.\nUnder the 1965 Constitution, if the Queen did not appoint a governor-general within fourteen days of advice being tendered by the prime minister, a regent was to be appointed. In deference to the royal family, however, on 16 December, Smith amended his original plan and Dupont was appointed as officer administering the government. He would continue to use the title until the declaration of a republic in 1970.In a referendum held on 24 June 1969, the predominantly white electorate approved a new constitution making Rhodesia a republic, with the president as ceremonial head of state. A bill to that effect was passed by the Legislative Assembly on 17 November, and was signed into law by Dupont on 27 November. Dupont's last duty as officer administrating the government was to sign the proclamation of a republic on 2 March 1970."

        "content": "Masuda was one of the major candidates who attributed credit for coining the term information society. Although his book that uses such terms in the title dates back to 1980, there was already a public debate on the issue in the 50 and 60 in Japan. Thus, some authors suggest that the first scholars of the concept of Information Society appear in Japan : the book published by Yoneji Masuda in 1980 titled Johoka shakai, which means the higher stage of social evolution, from the perspective of the analogy with biological evolution. From post-industrial society to information society. The fifth chapter of it was entitled to turn the information age: quiet transformation of society. In it, Masuda tells of the birth of an era of information, focusing on computer technology, which operates in conjunction with communications technology. An information age is the time period during which takes place innovation information technology, becomes latent force of social transformation, able to cause an expansion in the quality of information and a large increase scale storage of information.\nThis was, for the author, the information society, focusing on computer technology, which would have a much more decisive impact on human society that the industrial revolution which began with the invention of the steam engine, because the fundamental role of the computer is to replace and amplify human mental work, while the basic function  of steam machinery was replacement and amplification of physical work.\nMasuda spoke also of the possibility of a highly organic society, pointing out the similarity of environmental information system of communications technology and computer information systems to organic bodies, which would suggest something important to the vision of the (then) future information society. On this basis, one could hypothesize that the future information society would be a highly integrated society, like an organism. It would be a complex multi-centered society in which many systems are connected and integrated by information networks. Further, this would be a dynamic society able to respond more quickly and appropriately to contemporary society-then-to the changing environment, and thus the information society of the future would appear to us as a society with a highly organic information space, linked by a network of cognitive information proaction dense mesh (feedforward).\nWriting about the social impact of the information age, Masuda understood to mean not only that would cause a great socioeconomic impact on contemporary industrial society, prove a force for social change powerful enough to transform human society into an absolutely new form, which is the information society. Overall, the innovative technology would change the social and economic systems through the following three phases:\n\nPhase 1. \u2013 In which technology does the work previously done for humans based on automation.\nPhase 2. \u2013 In which technology makes possible the realization of a work that man could never do before. Knowledge creation, leading to enlargement of the mental work of man.\nPhase 3. \u2013 In which socio-economic structures are transformed into new social and economic systems, a result of the first two phases of development.The futuristic vision of Masuda of goes further: in the global information society, all citizens will be bound together by a global network of information and knowledge, leading to the formation of a global consciousness, which will sweep away the differences of cultures, interests and nationalities. In predicting the introduction of a general education system, the disappearance of illiteracy, the advent of world peace and human happiness, Masuda does not restrict his futuristic vision to those social sectors or countries actively participating in industry or in services information, but predicts a real New World Order that he calls \"Computop\u00eda\""

In 1680 he moved to Amsterdam, where he soon became involved in the intellectual life of the city. In 1682 he came into contact with the works and the followers of Baruch Spinoza, whose ideas he did not share. He refuted them in his book  't Mom-Aensicht Der Atheistery Afgerukt, \"The mask of atheism torn off\", published in 1683. His Inleiding tot de Christelyke Gods-geleertheid, \"Introduction to Christian theology\", published in 1698, examines the relationship between scientific method and theology, and lays out his belief that religious differences could be resolved by a scientific approach.In 1707 Verwer published his Linguae Belgicae Idea, grammatica, poetica, rhetorica; deprompta ex adversariis Anonymi Batavi: in usum proximi amici (\"Grammar, poetry and rhetoric of the Belgian language, from the notes of an anonymous Dutchman, for the use of a close friend\"), in which he criticises the Nederduitsche spraekkunst of Arnold Moonen, published in the previous year and based on the work of earlier writers such as Joost van den Vondel. Between 1708 and 1710 Verwer defended the position he had taken in the work in a number of open letters. His work was an important influence on two Dutch linguists, his friend Lambert ten Kate (1674\u20131731), and Balthazar Huydecoper (1695\u20131778). Like Verwer, ten Kate was a Mennonite merchant; his Gemeenschap tussen de Gottische Spraeke en de Nederduytsche, \"Relationship between the Gothic language and Dutch\", published in 1710, was written at Verwer's request, and consists in part of a letter to \"A.V.\", i.e., Adriaen Verwer. Verwer sent a presentation copy of this work to Adriaan Reland, professor at the University of Utrecht.Verwer's work on maritime law, Nederlants see-rechten, avaryen, en bodemeryen, \"Dutch maritime law, damages, and loans\", was published in 1711. It was his most successful book and was reprinted in 1716, in 1730 and in 1764.\nVerwer took a keen amateur interest in mathematics, and particularly admired Isaac Newton. His copy of the first edition of the Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica (1687), extensively annotated in his hand, is preserved in the Universiteitsbibliotheek Utrecht.Adriaen Verwer died in Amsterdam on 31 March 1717."

Reporting to the carrier USS Enterprise in April 1942, Ensign Jaccard later took part in the Battle of Midway. Flying as a wingman to Lieutenant Commander C. Wade McClusky during his dive attack he apparently mistook his undercarriage lever for the wing-brake lever and slowed his plane by lowering his wheels instead of his brake flaps. While he missed his target on that dive, he is credited with a hit on the Imperial Japanese Navy carrier Hiry\u016b (later the same day) and on cruiser Mogami (the next day).\nJaccard flew with Bombing Squadron 6 in support of the landings at Guadalcanal as well as the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in which Enterprise was severely damaged.  Bombing 6 was ordered to Efate where a four-plane division including Jaccard was detached and sent to the USS Wasp. Jaccard was killed when Wasp was torpedoed and sunk on 15 September 1942."

She had a younger sister, Adelaide, born three years later.\nStruggling as a painter, Marshall Claxton emigrated with his family in 1850 to Australia, where his brother-in-law Richard Hargrave had established himself as a settler in New South Wales. Other family members emigrated as well, including Lawrence Hargrave, who became an aeronautical pioneer. Claxton's arrival in Sydney was celebrated in the newspapers, but he once again struggled to find the fame he desired. The family moved on yet again in 1854, this time to India. After a three-year stay, the family returned to England via Ceylon and Egypt. The experience of international travel proved to be formulative to the sisters as artists, \"both expanding the geographic scope of their subject matter and equipping them with something of an outsider's perspective on Victorian society.\"The Claxton sisters were returned to England She was just about 20 years old when she signed an 1859 petition asking the Royal Academy of Arts to open its doors to women.  Her father trained Florence and her sister in his craft; Florence travelled with her father to Australia, India, and Egypt in the years from 1850 to 1857, while he searched for employment. In the later 1850s both sisters found work in the production of engravings for the popular press. In 1860, Florence illustrated Married Off: A Satirical Poem, by \"H. B.\"\nIn 1858, Florence exhibited her painting Scenes from the Life of a Female Artist in the second annual show of the Society of Women Artists. In the following year, 1859, she signed a petition advocating the admission of women to the Royal Academy Schools, and exhibited her Scenes of Life of an Old Maid in the Society of Women Artists show.\nIn 1864, the sisters were apparently sharing a home together in London, but their paths separated. On 1 June 1868, Florence married Ernest Farrington, a French photographer and engineer,  in Paris. Little is known of their married life, but Florence claimed to have lived in Monaco for some years. There were no children from the marriage and she was widowed likely by 1881, when she was back living alone with her father in London.Florence did not remarry and was later estranged from her sister. She continued to work as an illustrator and artist. On 3 May 1920, at her home, Grafton House in Sandown, Isle of Wight, she died by suicide by taking a fatal overdose of veronal \"in a carefully planned suicide.\""

        "content": "Claxton's best-known work is The Choice of Paris: An Idyll (c. 1860), a satire on, and parody of, the works of the Pre-Raphaelite artists of the previous years. The painting is patterned after William Holman Hunt's A Converted British Family sheltering a Christian Missionary from the persecution of the Druids, and combines caricatures of many of the main figures of the movement, including John Ruskin and Sir John Everett Millais, with figures of popular culture like P. T. Barnum, and allusions to the great artists of the past. It depicts Millais in the role of Paris, offering the golden apple to a scrawny-looking medieval woman, ignoring a Raphael madonna (copied from The Marriage of the Virgin) and a modern woman in crinolines. The painting also includes parodies of other Pre-Raphaelite works, including Millais' Sir Isumbras at the Ford, Spring: Apple Blossoms and The Vale of Rest. It also caricatures Calderon's Broken Vows and Windus's Burd Helen. The picture was reproduced as a full-page wood-engraving by the Illustrated London News on 2 June 1860."

Women's Work may have been a feminist riposte to Ford Madox Brown's painting Work, which focused on men's labors but neglected women.Florence Claxton married a \"Mr. Farrington, of Romsey,\" in 1868, but continued to work and exhibit at least sporadically afterward.Claxton also wrote humorous skits on feminism and women's rights, most notably in The Adventures of a Woman in Search of her Rights, a story in cartoon form. In the book, a young woman falls in love with a dashing youth, but her parents do not approve and her lover leaves. She decides to pursue her rights. She loses her looks through the study of John Stuart Mill and; now made ugly, she pursues various careers, becoming a lawyer, a politician and a doctor, but eventually fails in all of her pursuits. She finally emigrates to the United States and marries Brigham Young, the polygamous Mormon leader. In the end, it turns out to have been all a dream and she ends with the words \"thank goodness it's only a midsummer night's dream and I'm not emancipated\".\n\n\n== References =="

He considered the new ethnic groups to be a threat to Norwegian homogeneity, and believed that it would be devastating for the country in the long run. His solution for helping those in need, was to support them in local refugee camps, rather than letting them come to Norway. Although he stated that all humans were of equal worth, he voiced support for nativism, arguing that each country's native citizens should be given special preferential rights in relation to migrants and refugees.He was also opposed to the European Economic Community (later the European Union), which he believed would eventually collapse like the Soviet Union. He thought that the principle of open borders would destroy the common fellowship and good camaraderie between countries. In 2001 he argued that the demand voiced by Lars Sponheim for increased work-based immigration to Norway was evocative of the \"slave-owner ideology\" of former colonial societies, such as the slaveholding United States. In addition, he held that Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland expressed racist attitudes when he promoted immigration to Norway in order to make immigrants take the \"dirty jobs\" Norwegians would not accept. He maintained that the immigrants in turn would become just as selective as the Norwegians, which in turn would require a corresponding increase of immigration.\n\n\n== References =="

His best season was 1958, when he won the overall silver medal in both the European Championships at Eskilstuna and in the World Championships at Helsinki, on both occasions trailing just behind Oleg Goncharenko. It is widely acknowledged that Shilykovsky had to skate the final 10,000 m distance in much less favourable conditions than Goncharenko, and Shilykovsky was seen as the \"moral world champion\" by the spectators and commentators.\nAt the start of the Olympic 1960 season, the world record on the 10,000 m was still the legendary 16:32.6 set in 1952 by Hjalmar Andersen (although Nikolay Shtelbaums had skated 16:31.4 in Chelyabinsk on 4 February 1959, a result not ratified by the International Skating Union (ISU)). On 31 January 1960 at Medeo, both Shtelbaums (16:18.9) and Shilykovsky (16:13.1) skated below Andersen's record time, at the traditional \"Prize of the Soviet Ministry of the Kazakh Republic\" competition; but again these world record times were not officially ratified by the ISU. At the 1960 Winter Olympics four weeks later, first Kjell B\u00e4ckman (16:14.2) and then Knut Johannesen (15:46.6) lowered the official world record, while Shilykovsky only managed a 20th place, skating in unfavourable conditions.\nShilykovsky's personal bests were 42.8 (500 m), 2:15.1 (1,500 m), 8:06.7 (5,000 m), in addition to the 16:13.1 (10,000 m).\nShilykovsky grew up in Vladimir but moved to Moskva for education and for sports. He became Moskva champion in 1955 and finished his master of sports degree the same year. He skated for Shakhter and later on for Spartak. He held a degree in technical sciences (\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a) from 1969, and published scholarly articles in his field.\nShilykovsky was a highly unusual athlete by being able to compete at world top level in spite of a severe handicap; he lost his right arm when he was six months old as the result of an illness. This did not stop him taking part in all normal activities. In addition to his speed skating achievements, he was an accomplished swimmer and cyclist."

Seelig competed in France for a few years, also boxing in Belgium and England.  He emigrated to the United States via Cuba in 1935. In his remaining career, he fought nearly every top middleweight contender of his era.  He enjoyed success in the U.S. compiling a career record of 57 bouts, 40 victories (9 KOs), 7 draws, and 10 losses, and he would fight against several champions including reigning IBU world middleweight champion Marcel Thil, former world middleweight champion Freddy Yarosz, world middleweight champion Fred Apostoli, and reigning world middleweight champion Al Hostak.   One of his highest rankings in The Ring was #6 in 1938, though he would climb as high as #5 between 1935-40.On May 22, 1933, Seelig fought an important bout against IBU world middleweight champion Marcel Thil at the Palais de Sports in Paris, losing in a twelve-round points decision. Thil was also the former holder of the NBA world middleweight title, and would later hold the European light heavyweight title in 1934.

Seelig blasted Rossi around the ring for seven rounds with both lefts and rights, backing him into the ropes, and landing dangerous hooks.  Fifty-five seconds into the eighth, Seelig threw his signature overhand right to the jaw of Rossi and ended the bout. Lacking boxing science and appearing wild at times when he took head shots while wading in, Seelig continued his attack, nonetheless, and rocked Rossi with hooks to the face and damaging blows to the midsection.In only his second bout in New York, Seelig knocked out Charley Bellanger on November 11, 1935, to a winning reception, fifty-two seconds into the fourth round at New York's St. Nicholas arena.  An overhand right to the point of the jaw, preceded by a storm of lightning fast blows to the head and body, dropped Bellanger for the count.  After Seelig was momentarily down to one knee from a terrific right hook to the jaw, he fought cautiously, realizing that long range fighting would not be his best bet against Bellanger who had a slight advantage in reach.   Another right to the chin put Bellanger down momentarily in the second.  The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, wrote, \"a fighting heart, a will to win and two strong arms that keep whirling like a windmill...have combined to enlist the hearts of American fighting fans to his side.\"  The New York crowd gave him an enormous hand at the end of the bout."

His troubled childhood would later inspire him to write La Graine and Meilleur de la Vie. Returning to Paris after completing high school, he became involved in left wing politics and began to associate with writers. His imprisonment in a German stalag during the Second World War heavily influenced his writing during that period. In Le temps des Morts, Gascar recounts his time spent working as a gravedigger at the Rava-Ruska prison camp in Ukraine, during which time he was conscripted to track down Jews hiding in the area.\nGascar became a journalist after the end of the war. In 1953, after winning the Prix Goncourt for Les B\u00eates and Le temps des morts, he decided to devote himself entirely to his literary work. His writing, characterised by an exploration of the relationship between plants, animals and people, began to gain greater appreciation from the general public. He started to write biographies, focusing on personalities in which he recognised parts of himself, such as his thirst for knowledge, his independence and his feelings of restlessness. Among the figures he wrote about were Humboldt, Buffon and Bernard Palissy. Aside from his biographical work, he took to writing studies of nature, taking a poetic and philosophical approach. Major works of this kind include Le pr\u00e9sage, Les sources and Le r\u00e8gne v\u00e9g\u00e9tal.\nThe screenplay of Georges Franju's film Les Yeux sans visage (1960) was in large part written by Gascar. Other works include plays, notably Les pas perdus, picture books and prefaces.\nAfter winning the Grand Prix of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, he won the Prix Roger Caillois in 1994. Gascar shared Caillois' fascination with the natural world, while however retaining a firm focus on its relationship with human society.\nHe died in 1997. The majority of his works were published by \u00c9ditions Gallimard."

        "content": "He made his debut for the youth team of Hakoah Vienna (Hebrew for the Force, a Jewish multisports club in Vienna) and moved to the first team, then playing in the Austrian second division. His first match in the first division came in December 1920 with the Hakoah first team, who had just been promoted. He marked his appearance with a goal. However, he continued to play sporadically for the first team, more often used as a reserve. Therefore, he decided to move clubs, and left for FAC, Floridsdorfer AC who had just been relegated to the second division. The objective was for the team to be immediately re-promoted to the first division, and the following season, Floridsdorfer returned to the elite. Drucker was one of the key players for the team, playing almost every game in the victorious 1925\u20131926 season in the first division. During this season, he played twice for the Vienna city team, against Krak\u00f3w in September 1925 and Bratislava in March 1926.\nHe rejoined Hakoah Vienna the following season. In 1926, during a very successful club tour to the United States, he received an offer to play in the ASL, the American Soccer League. He signed for the Brooklyn Wanderers in New York. He played two seasons at the club. In 1928, there was a split with the creation of a rival league in the ESL. Drucker left to play for the newly created New York Hakoah (also known as the Hakoah All-Stars) where he rejoined his former teammates from Hakoah Vienna. With the club, he won the US Open Cup. Drucker played 136 matches in the ASL.\nIn 1931, Leopold Drucker moved back to his home club, Hakoah Vienna. In July 1932, he won his first cap for the Austria national team in a 4-3 win against Sweden in Stockholm. While the newspapers reported on an excellent performance by Drucker, this was his only international cap, possibly due to the political situation at the time. Drucker was the only Hakoah player to play for the Wunderteam, the name given to the brilliant Austria national team of the 1920s-1930s.\nIn 1933, he left Hakoah for the 3rd time, and after a brief spell at FAC - rejoined his former coach at Hakoah, and former Austrian international, Vinzenz Dittrich, at Olympique de Marseille. He also played with his former teammate J\u00f3szef Eisenhoffer. During the 1933-34 season, Drucker played 16 matches in the French Championship and played in the final of the Coupe de France, losing 2-1 to FC S\u00e8te.\nAt the end of the season, he left for Malta, which he knew through a tournament with FAC. In the following years, Drucker was a player and coach for Floriana FC, St. George's FC and Melita FC, leading the latter to the 1938/39 Maltese FA Trophy, the greatest honour in the club's history to date. After the outbreak of the Second World War, he moved to Palestine, where he played and coached in Jerusalem. After the war, he moved to New York, where in 1947, he worked for Athletic Club Hakoah.\n\n\n== References =="

He was educated at Harrow School.  In 1823 he entered Oriel College, Oxford. In 1825 he became a scholar of Trinity College and also won the Ireland scholarship, and three years later he was elected fellow of Balliol College.  He became a member of the Inner Temple and practised on the western circuit, being made in 1841 recorder of Falmouth, Helston and Penzance.From 1837 to 1842 he was professor of political economy at the University of Oxford. In this capacity he delivered a course of lectures on the British Colonies in which he dealt with questions of emigration, employment of labour and the allotment of public lands.  The reputation he secured by these lectures had much to do with his appointment in 1847 as Assistant Under-Secretary for the colonies, and in the next year he became Permanent Under-Secretary.  In 1859 he was transferred to the permanent under-secretaryship for India, receiving the distinction of CB.  In 1870, Merivale was awarded the degree of DCL by Oxford University. He died in 1874 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.\nBesides his Lectures on Colonization and Colonies (1841), he published Historical Studies (1865), and completed the Memoirs of Sir Philip Francis (1867); he wrote the second volume of the Life of Sir Henry Lawrence (1872) in continuation of Sir Herbert Edwardes's work.A tribute to his powers as an original thinker by his chief at the Colonial Office, Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, is printed with a notice of his career which his brother contributed to the Transactions (1884) of the Devonshire Association."

He ran for mayor in the 1896 Toronto municipal election but was defeated by the incumbent Robert J. Fleming. As alderman again in 1897, he was elected mayor by council, after Mayor Fleming resigned in August 1897.\nDuring the summer of 1898, the new City Hall on Queen Street was completed and occupied. Ten years earlier construction had started on the city hall designed by Toronto architect E. J. Lennox. Mayor Shaw and his wife were part of the opening ceremonies and were lifted to the top of the clock tower in a wooden workman's lift.\nMayor Shaw believed that the northland's development was very important to Toronto. He presided over the Toronto and Hudson's Bay Railway Commission. The commission was to determine the feasibility of building a railway from Toronto to Hudson Bay. Although the project had many supporters, the line was never built. He was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada.\nJohn Shaw left politics for a time after his mayoral term.

        "content": "In 2003, Blalock had a breakthrough year, hitting 29 home runs and 90 RBIs with a .309 batting average. A combination of being able to hit for power and for average drew early comparisons to George Brett and helped him to get voted to the All-Star Game in his first full season as a Ranger, where he hit the game-winning home run off Los Angeles Dodgers closer \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 in the bottom of the 8th inning to give the American League a 7-6 victory.\nBlalock finished the 2004 season with 32 home runs and over 100 RBIs, and was voted to his second All-Star Game, when he participated in the Home Run Derby. A disappointing 2005 season made Blalock the center of many trade rumors. He was not traded, however, and he played 2006 with the Rangers.\nHank had his own fan club called Hank's Homies during his time with the Rangers. They were a group of guys who wore cowboy hats, eyeblack, and Blalock jerseys to the games. The Rangers even installed hooks for the Homies to hang their sign to support Hank.\nOn Mother's Day, May 14, 2006, Blalock was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. He hit his 100th career home run on June 23, 2006, in the sixth inning of a game against the Colorado Rockies.\nBlalock's decreasing performance since his breakout 2003 season led many to believe that he would be traded to make room for Mark DeRosa to take a full-time position in the Rangers' infield. However, the hiring of new manager Ron Washington, who was credited with improving the play of Oakland Athletics third baseman Eric Chavez, seemed to guarantee that Blalock would not be traded; and in fact, the Rangers declined to sign DeRosa, allowing him to file for free agency.\nBlalock was diagnosed with Thoracic outlet syndrome during the 2007 season and underwent surgery in May 2007 to remove his first rib. He returned to the lineup in September, but did not take the field at third base until 2008 in spring training.\nDuring the 2008 season, Blalock injured a hamstring, placing him on the disabled list again for the second time in two seasons. On May 18, 2008, Blalock and the Rangers announced that upon his return to the team, he would return as a first baseman. Blalock had never played first base as a professional, but he felt it was the best move for the team, as the Rangers had not seen much offensive production from their first basemen in 2008. Blalock worked with Ron Washington and spoke with Phil Nevin (who made a similar switch from third to first with San Diego in 2002) to start learning the position. With the emergence of Chris Davis at first base, Blalock temporarily returned to third, but eventually switched positions with Davis to avoid more shoulder problems.\n\nBlalock signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays for the 2010 season. His contract was purchased on May 15. He was designated for assignment on June 29, 2010 to make room for Gabe Kapler, and was released on July 8.\nBlalock retired after the 2010 season, and currently resides in San Diego."

The Marian apparitions were originally determined by the local ordinary, after consultation with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), to be lacking in sufficient evidence of credibility. However, a process of review which began in 2013 and is ongoing as of 2022 has reached a provisional finding of the 'validity and exemplarity of the mystical-spiritual experience of Pierina, as well as the richness of her existential, humble and virtuous story.' Having reached a favourable view of the person of the visionary, the diocese is conducting a review of the theology of Pierina's writings in the light of Catholic teaching.Pierina was born in the municipality of Montichiari which is located in the Brescia province of the Lombardy region in northern Italy. She died there  when she was 79 years old. She is mainly known as the seer who claimed the Blessed Virgin Mary revealed herself as Rosa Mystica; the message focussed on Our Lady's motherly care for her deeply beloved consecrated souls of priests and of male and female members of religious institutes within the Roman Catholic Church."

        "content": "Pierina Gilli was born on August 3, 1911, in the San Giorgio section of the northern Italian municipality of Montichiari. Her parents, Pancrazio Gilli and Rosa Bartoli, had three children, of which Pierina was the eldest. Her family was poor, as her father worked as a daily hired farm-worker. Due to its limited household income, the family often moved to various residences in Montichiari.When Pierina was seven years old her father, died, leaving her mother to support the three children. Between 1918 and 1922, Pierina was placed in a Montichiari orphanage, conducted by the sisters of the Handmaids of Charity. This experience had a lasting impact on Pierina. Pierina received her First Holy Communion in the orphanage when she was eight.Pierina returned to her family to assist her mother with the care of her two younger siblings, at the age of 11.  At age 12, her mother (who was now remarried), and eight siblings moved to live in a cottage with her step-family. Pierina claimed she had received inappropriate attention from her step-father. Although not wishing to introduce any discord into these two families that were now living together, Pierina eventually confided everything to her mother. Partly due to that trauma, Pierina decided to consider a vocation in the religious life at age seventeen. Her confessor advised her to wait, in order to further discern any genuine religious calling to the consecrated life.\nDespite all of Pierina's troubles, a soothing glimpse of her caring and devout family upbringing can be observed by this early childhood reminiscence from Pierina's diary: \"I was the first of nine children, I the first to be delighted in the joy, the bliss, and the caresses of my parents. The day of 3 August 1911 was the dawn of my earthly coming, and I was baptized on August 5, the feast of the Madonna of the Snow; on that given day, my Mamma consecrated me to the true Mamma in Heaven, so that her maternal protection would preserve me as white and pure as snow.\"."

When she was twenty years old, a marriage proposal was made to her by an honest and well-intentioned young man. For two months Pierina intimately suffered so much, because she did not feel herself to be called to the married life, but rather, she felt that the Lord wanted her totally for Himself. Her confessor finally spoke concerning her most genuine thoughts, thus confirming her vocation. Pierina was initially accepted as a postulant by the religious sisters' community of the Handmaids of Charity, but this soon had to be set aside for the first time by Pierina due to her health problems, including pleurisy, that persisted for several months. Instead, Pierina sought employment, and she worked for about seven years (from age 20 to 26: from 1931 to 1937) as a domestic servant of Father Giuseppe Brochini, and as caretaker of his elderly (frail and blind) mother, in the nearby small town of Carpenedolo.\nPierina then focused on obtaining her nursing license at the \"White Villa\" Care Home (managed by the Sisters of Charity of St. Antida Thouret) in the city of Brescia. Subsequently, starting at age 29, and throughout the four years of World War II (1941\u20131945), she worked as a licensed nurse's aide in the Civil Hospital (managed by the Handmaids of Charity) in the smaller city of Desenzano del Garda, located on the southern shore of Lake Garda, within sight of the north Italian Alps."

She died in 1855, and was  canonized a saint on June 12, 1954, by Pope Pius XII.On April 14, 1944, Pierina, then 32 years old, was accepted as a postulant by the Handmaids of Charity. She never attained the profession of final religious vows at this religious institute. Even so, this congregation of women deeply influenced her spiritual growth during her formative years, continuing well into her later life. She was subsequently assigned as a nurse at the Children's Hospital in the city of Brescia. On December 1, 1944, Pierina contracted meningitis, and was taken to her religious order's infirmary in Ronco for infectious isolation and medical treatment. The infirmary was  located in a tiny section of the small Alpine village of Corteno Golgi, in the Brescia province.  After twelve days in a comatose state Pierina was administered the Last Rites. Pierina recorded that beginning December 17, 1944, Sister Maria Crocifissa Di Rosa began to appear to her. Sister Maria held a vial of ointment that was given to her by Our Lady, and she anointed Pierina, saying comfortingly to her: \"You will be cured, but you will have a heavy cross to bear.\"On November 2, 1946, Pierina was stricken by an intestinal occlusion and was again taken to the Civil Hospital in the  Montichiari. During the night of November 23\u201324, 1946, Blessed Maria Crocifissa appeared to her again. Also, for the first time, the Madonna appeared, as described in Pierina's diary: \"Then I see the most beautiful Lady, as if transparent, dressed in purple with a white veil that descends from her head to her feet; she held her arms open, and I saw three swords piercing her heart.\" Our Lady did not speak to, nor converse with, Pierina at that time.A few months later, on March 12, 1947, after suffering heart failure followed by renal colic, Pierina had to be admitted again to the Civil Hospital of Montichiari, where she lost consciousness, She was assisted by her congregational sisters as well as by her mother and sisters, who feared that she might die. Again, Pierina convalesced slowly. During the month of May 1947, Pierina was subjected to diabolical vexations and experienced a vision of Hell."

The last recorded Marian apparition occurred on March 24, 1983, to Pierina, being 71 years old, in her Boschetti home when Mary expressed her desire to see the realization of a special Marian Sanctuary with five cupolas in Montichiari, and specifically requested that progress be made in producing a Mystical Rose Sanctuary medal according to her instructions.Pierina Gilli, at the age of 79, died on January 12, 1991, at Montichiari, in the Boschetti section.After Pierina's death, during the 1990s and 2000s (decade), despite the local Brescia diocese's generally unsupportive historical stance, some 40 reported apparitions of Our Lady, a few times as the sorrowful Madonna, though mostly as Mary the Mystical Rose; as recorded in Pierina Gilli's diaries.\nThe number of visitors coming to Fontanelle and Montichiari increased sufficiently that in 2001, two priests were assigned in regard to the spiritual care of the pilgrims.In relation to Montichiari and to Fontanelle, the spiritual conversions and the miraculous cures and the liberation from diabolical possessions are still continuing, accompanied by other supernatural signs, such as (for examples) solar prodigies and luminous crosses in the sky. Sociologist Bruno Massaro has researched the apparitions, and has written a book on his findings The Case of Pierina Gilli of Montichiari (2003).La Madre della Chiesa, Rosa Mistica: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: Le Anime, La Famiglia, La Chiese (The Mother of the Church, the Mystical Rose: Fatima, Bonate, Montichiari: The Souls, The Family, The Church), is a book compiled by Father Eligio Garbo, which informs mostly about the Montichiari apparitions."

        "content": "The following five pronouncements were made over the course of several decades by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brescia as cited by Kevin Symonds and Alfredo Tradigo:\nCommunicated by the Episcopal Curia on June 30, 1968: \"The Monsignor Bishop vividly exhorts all the faithful that they declare themselves respectful to the directives of the Church not to favor either by publications or by pilgrimages the spreading of devotions that are founded upon a non-approved interpretation of facts neither objectively controlled nor responsibly evaluated.\"\nCommunicated by Monsignor Luigi Morstabilini on November 25, 1975: \"The Monsignor Bishop renews the firm invitation to the faithful and to the clergy because by their obsequious acceptance of preceding decisions they might find at other sanctuaries and places recognized by the Church the better form to experience the right and necessary devotion to the Mother of God according to more authentic contents of faith and of Catholic spirituality.\"\nDeclaration of Monsignor Bruno Foresti on October 15, 1984: \"The Bishop of Brescia supported by the authoritative opinion of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, communicates that (a) the aforementioned apparitions of Our Lady the Mystical Rose in Montichiari do not present motives of credibility; (b) the cult relative to Our Lady the Mystical Rose, therefore, is not approved and can not be practiced nor favored; (c) whosoever favors it, by spreading publications or by organizing pilgrimages, does not help, but disturbs the faith of believers by inducing them to behave contrary to the disposition of the Church.\"\nDeclaration of Monsignor Bruno Foresti on February 19, 1997: \"The Bishop of Brescia holding accountable some various solicitations that come continuously requested in merit, both from Italy and from external nations, reconfirms that which was disposed by him and by his predecessors.\"\nIn the attachment to Decree number 229/08 by Monsignor Luciano Munari on March 19, 2008, at point 2 is read: \"In a particular way there is explicitly asked of individuals and of groups, that until now are more or less directly dedicated to promote the Marian cult in the Fontanelle locality, to respect all the indications of the Directory, and not to spread the messages or publications, neither to promote the acts of the cult, nor to send compositions that might even only indirectly induce the faithful to restrain both the judgment and the Church on the aforementioned apparitions or other extraordinary phenomena, even as may be modified in a positive sense.\"The Brescia diocesan bishops' have repeatedly clarified that the alleged apparitions have not been approved, and discouraged the premature promotion of the cultus, while at the same time making provision for the spiritual care of those who nonetheless go there. Bishop Giulio Sanguineti appointed on May 5, 2001, Monsignor Piero Boselli, Director of the Liturgical Office of the Diocesan Curia, as the Presider of a constituted Committee, \"with the purpose of watching over the devotional manifestations, while avoiding what might rest entrusted to the arbitrariness of occasional (casual) and passing-through priests\"; moreover, \"Responsible for the activities and for the judgment of Marian devotions is the diocesan Bishop only, in which the singular care directed on the part of the Diocese can avoid the possible multiplications of episodes tending to reinforce some simple convictions around presumed extraordinary phenomena. This responsibility is necessarily retained also to avoid slightly illuminated devotional practices and certain forms of tendentious preachings.\"In July 2013, the Diocese of Brescia again updated the Directory regulating worship at the apparition sites. In short, Our Lady can be honoured under the title Rosa Mystica because this is an ancient title of the Madonna; but no reference may be made during official activities to the alleged visions and their messages.\nIn 2014, an official decree of the Diocese of Brescia erected the \"Foundation Rosa Mystica Fontanelle\" as the Church's official organisation to care for the property and activities at Fontanelle. It is noteworthy that the cycle of monthly and annual events include all the particular devotions (13th day of each month, and special activities on 13 July, 13 October and 8 December) which can be found in the alleged revelations. While the new Foundation's mission is not to promote the alleged messages of Pierina Gilli, and stresses that her claims must currently be considered as being \"a pure personal experience\", their website does nevertheless refer to them by necessity when explaining why the shrine came to be.On 7 December 2019, Bishop Tremolda (Bishop of Brescia since 2017) instituted an official sanctuary of Our Lady Rosa Mystica at the apparition site in Fontanelle. In a letter issued 21 November 2019, the new bishop recognises that many thousands of pilgrims have come to this place to honour Our Lady, and is cautiously optimistic that this is a healthy devotion for the Christian faithful. His letter acknowledges that judging the fruits of the devotion is as important as weighing up Pierina's claims in judging this spiritual phenomenon. He also mentions that there is a 'renewed phase' of investigation taking place, with the Diocese of Brescia and the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith continuing to evaluate the claims."

He first gained national attention for his book \"The Southerner,\" published in 1957 and followed by \"Strangers on the Shore\". Later, he became director of information for the Peace Corps, serving from 1961 until 1963.  He left the government and became a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune newspaper and in his first week on the job rode in the press bus in the motorcade of President John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. By 1966, NBC News had taken notice of his varied background and hired him as a correspondent.  He would remain with that network for the rest of his life.\nKiker became distinguished for his numerous assignments over the years for NBC. Perhaps his best-known work was covering military conflicts in Southeast Asia (namely Vietnam) and the Mideast (particularly the Iranian Revolution); during much of that time, he served as NBC's Rome bureau chief, with a territory encompassing most of Europe and western Asia. He received the Peabody Award in 1970 for his coverage of the Black September in Jordan conflict.\nBut Kiker also excelled at domestic stories, as well, including the civil rights movement and U.S. politics.  He reported from Walter Reed Army Medical Center on the 1969 death of President Dwight Eisenhower.  He was also the commentator on the August 9, 1974 live broadcast of President Richard Nixon's departure from office in disgrace from the Watergate scandal. Kiker filed reports for David Brinkley's documentaries and short-lived newsmagazines during the 1970s, in addition to his regular work on NBC Nightly News, where he occasionally anchored on the weekends.  Kiker worked as a floor reporter during NBC's coverage of the 1972 political conventions and was Washington editor for Today in the mid- to late 1970s.\nIn the early 1980s, Kiker did a report critical of radio personality Howard Stern, just as Stern was leaving a Washington D.C. station to join WNBC-AM in New York.\nDespite the success of his 1950s novels, Kiker did not return to book length fiction until later in his life, when he wrote three mystery novels, \"Murder on Clam Pond\" (published in 1986), \"Death at the Cut\" (1988), and \"Death Below Deck\" (1991). The mysteries were set on Cape Cod and featured reporter Mac McFarland. They received considerable critical acclaim.\nAccording to obituaries in The New York Times and other major newspapers, Douglas Kiker died in his sleep, apparently from a heart attack, while vacationing at his beloved Cape Cod summer home in Chatham, Massachusetts. He was 61. He was survived by his wife, one daughter, and four sons."

        "content": "Masecki started taking music lessons from his father at age three. He took up piano at seven and quickly began showing talent for improvising as well as interpreting classical music. These have proven to be the two main pillars of his activity. He studied classical piano in the Chopin Secondary School in Warsaw under prof. Ma\u0142gorzata Rawska and jazz piano under Andrzej Jakodzi\u0144ski, graduating in 1998. During his school years he frequented the legendary Wednesday jam sessions at Akwarium Jazz Club. At this time he formed his first jazz trio with Wojciech Pulcyn on bass and Grzegorz Grzyb on drums and joined the band Alchemik. Together they won the Grand Prix at the Europ Jazz Contest Hoeilaart and Masecki won the \"Best Soloist\" prize.In 2002 he graduated from Berklee College of Music. Together with Ziv Ravitz and Garth Stevenson he formed the trio TAQ. He also met singer, composer Candelaria Saenz Valiente, his future wife.Upon returning to Poland he joined the Zbigniew Wegehaupt Quartet, recording two albums \"Wege\" (2005) and \"Tota\" (2008). He continued performing with Alchemik, and electric quintet Oxen, as well as occasionally performing with pop-star Edyta G\u00f3rniak. For the majority of 2008 he was member of the band Pink Freud, culminating in the release of a concert album \u201cAlchemia\u201d.  Also in 2008 he started spending time the legendary cafe and artistic meeting hub Ch\u0142odna 25. There he met future collaborator Grzegorz Lewandowski and various musicians from the independent label Lado ABC. This marked an explosion of projects and collaborations. Together with his wife and Macio Moretti he formed the avant-pop band Paristetris. They recorded two albums (\"Paristetris\" 2008 and \"Honeydarlin\" 2010) and performed extensively. In 2008, he released an improvised concert album from Ch\u0142odna 25 with Moretti and Raphael Rogi\u0144ski called \u201c2525252525\u201d. 2009 saw the release of his first solo album Bob, recorded in his kitchen in Buenos Aires. In 2011, he formed the jazz sextet Profesjonalizm, recording a critically acclaimed album Chopin Chopin Chopin. In 2014, he wrote and recorded a set of polonaises for his new nonet Polonezy. This album won him one of the most prestigious artistic awards in Poland - Polityka's Passport Award for Contemporary Music. Parallel to these he pursued traditional classical projects, often introducing non-classical elements. In 2013, he released Bach's Art of the Fugue recorded on an old tape dictaphone. In 2015, he released \u201cBeethoven: The Last Sonatas\u201d performed with ear stoppers and noise-blocking headphones, in order to experience the perspective of the deaf composer. 2017 saw the release of Chopin: Nocturnes played on his faithful companion - a small 6-octave upright piano which he rarely tunes.Masecki is also an active composer. In 2015, he was commissioned to write a large piece for the Voluntary Firebrigade Brass Orchestra from S\u0142upca which became his \"Symphony nr 1\" and was released on CD. He also composed \"Wolno\u015b\u0107\" for the cello ensemble Cellonet, performed at Warsaw's Royal Castle at the opening of the IX Witold Lutos\u0142awski Competition. More recently he wrote \"We Are Crying\" for women's choir and brass orchestra on commission from the Jazztopad Festival in Wroc\u0142aw.From 2014, he has been involved in Plac Defilad, an outdoor summer programme of Teatr Studio. In the 2015 season he played weekly classical recitals; in 2016, together with Tomasz Pokrzywi\u0144ski he co-produced \u201cTranskrypcje\u201d a series devoted to Beethoven's complete symphonies in chamber arrangements; in 2017 they hosted a series of classical jam sessions, exploring the possibilities of improvisation within the classical framework. Every year in Plac Defilad he performs a grand ball with his big-band. In 2017 he was joined by singer Jan M\u0142ynarski. Together they will be releasing an album of polish jazz from the 20s and 30s.\nIn 2017 he has started performing ragtimes, his childhood passion. An album with drummer Jerzy Rogiewicz is scheduled for 2018. As session musician he has worked with Tomasz Sta\u0144ko, Wojciech Waglewski, Zbigniew Namys\u0142owski, Micha\u0142 Urbaniak and Barry Guy among others.

A Triumph of Julius Cesar by him was found in Vienna, and pictures in the National Gallery, The Capture of Carthage and Continence of Scipio, and the Rape of the Sabine Women, with the subsequent Reconciliation between the Romans and Sabines, have been ascribed Rinaldo instead of Romano."

He also played representative rugby union for Canterbury.\nTalbot was born at Christchurch in 1903 and educated at Christ's College in the city, where he captained the First XI cricket team and the First XV Rugby team.A middle-order batsman and medium-pace bowler, he made his first-class debut for Canterbury in a Plunket Shield match against Otago in January 1923, aged 19. He scored 105 in the first innings, the highest score in the match, and after not bowling in Otago's first innings, took 3 for 38 in the second. Canterbury won by 10 wickets, won Talbot's next match as well, and finished the season champions.In 1925-26 he took 5 for 106 in 18 overs as Wellington made 494 for 9 on the first day, then made a pair when Wellington dismissed Canterbury cheaply twice on the second day. He did not make a fifty between his debut match and 1929\u201330, when he scored 50 and 113 in a narrow loss to Wellington.

He was the only player not to appear in the Tests. Early in the tour he played a part in the victory over MCC at Lord's, when he made 66 in 50 minutes, \"hitting half-volleys as if he hated them\", and hitting one ball onto the top of the pavilion roof. Wisden reported that he had started the tour well, but \"lost his punishing powers\" as he \"endeavoured to play a more correct game\".Opening the batting for Canterbury against Auckland in the first match of the 1932-33 season he made 55 and 117, his highest score. He moved to Otago ahead of the 1933\u201334 season, playing four matches over the following three seasons, scoring 151 runs and taking four wickets.Talbot also played squash, golf, bowls and athletics, and played representative rugby for Canterbury.

After that, he devoted the rest of his life mainly to enlightening inhabitants in modern-day Tainan until he died in 1688. Significantly, this was the very first opportunity for local people to learn Han Chinese culture.

In 1652, he unintentionally arrived in Taiwan when Taiwan was ruled by Dutch. Importantly, this was a full decade before Koxinga arrived in Taiwan. Shen Guangwen was one of the mainlanders who escaped to Taiwan, as the Manchu took the imperial capital to rule Southward in mainland China. In fact, Shen Guangwen traveled in the Southeastern area of the mainland between 1645 and 1651. Eventually he moved to Tainan after staying approximately for one year in Yilan, Taiwan."

He also created pastiches of the work of leading Italian painters of the 16th century.  He designed cartoons for mosaics and worked as an art restorer.

        "content": "The life of Pietro della Vecchia is not very well documented and the information available is not always reliable.  He is believed to have been born in Vicenza in 1603 as the son of Gasparo della Vecchia, who was a painter admitted to the Venetian painters guild.  Some art historians place the artist's place of birth in Venice.  Pietro della Vecchia was erroneously called Pietro Muttoni after Luigi Lanzi in the first edition of his Storia pittorica della Italia (1796), mixed up the artist's name with that of a Muttoni collection, which kept one of his paintings.  Later authors interpreted de la Vecchia (meaning 'of the old') as a nickname as the artist liked to imitate the old masters of the previous century.  Pietro was in fact a scion of a well-known Venetian family called 'Dalla Vecchia'.Early sources describe Alessandro Varotari, called il Padovanino, as his teacher.  On stylistic grounds some art historians have expressed doubt on this traineeship in his early years.  The influence of the works of Padovanino is only visible after 1635.  So he may have worked with Padovanino at a later stage.  His earliest known work show a strong influence by Carlo Saraceni and Saraceni's pupil and collaborator Jean Leclerc.  This is an important indication that della Vecchia trained with them. As his work displayed for some time certain Caravaggesque characteristics it is believed that he spent time in Rome after the departure of Leclerc from Venice in 1621 or 1622.  Della Vecchia probably worked in Padovanino's workshop after his return from Rome in 1625 or 1626.  Padovanino, whose style was strongly rooted in early-16th-century Venetian art, likely played an important role in instilling in della Vecchia a great interest in 16th-century painting in Venice and the Veneto.The first documents in which the name of della Vecchia appears date back to the period from December 1626 to January 1628.  The documents deal with the payment for a banner the artist had made for the Confraternity of the Carmelites in the church of S. Marco in Pordenone. From 1629 to 1640 he was a member of the guild of painters in Venice.  In 1626 he married Clorinda R\u00e9gnier (or Clorinda Renieri), a daughter of the Flemish painter Nicolas R\u00e9gnier (or Renieri). Clorinda R\u00e9gnier was a painter in her own right and has been described as \"a woman of great spirit, of great stature and of great adherence\" (Tommaso Temanza, 1738).  Lucrezia R\u00e9gnier, the elder sister of della Vecchia's wife was married to Daniel van den Dyck, a Flemish painter active in Northern Italy.  Della Vecchia, together with his brother-in-law Daniel van den Dyck and their respective spouses, painted wall decorations in the Palazzo Pesaro in Preganziol.\nTowards the end of the 1630s della Vecchia had established his name as one of the leading painters of Venice, especially of religious works.  In January 1640 the procurators of S. Marco de Supra, responsible for the decoration of St Mark's Basilica, commissioned from him two cartoons for mosaics.  These appear to have been well received as della Vecchia was subsequently appointed Venice's \"pitor ducal\" (painter to the duke), a position he held until 1674, that is, until four years before his death.  In this capacity he was responsible for the design of the new mosaics and the restoration of the old ones in the Basilica.  Della Vecchia also received a commission to restore Giorgione's Castelfranco Madonna altarpiece in 1643-1644.At the height of his career, della Vecchia was a very sought-after teacher with a large workshop employing many assistants.  Della Vecchia also opened an academy in his house where live drawing classes were organised.  Gregorio Lazzarini was one of his pupils probably shortly after 1667.  Gregorio Lazzarini was later the teacher of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.  Della Vecchia also taught classes on the theory of art.Della Vecchia enjoyed fame as a connoisseur of ancient drawings and paintings.  Especially during the latter part of his life he was repeatedly consulted by collectors and merchants, often together with his father-in-law Nicolas R\u00e9gnier. Both he and his father-in-law had business relations with Paolo del Sera, who was the art agent in Venice of Leopoldo de' Medici, an Italian cardinal, scholar, patron of the arts and the Governor of Siena.  Marco Boschini, an engraver, art dealer and author who was a great admirer of della Vecchia, often joined the artist when he was asked to value paintings after 1670.\nDella Vecchia was close to the humanistic and libertine circle around the Accademia degli Incogniti (Academy of the Unknowns), a learned society of freethinking intellectuals, mainly noblemen, that significantly influenced the cultural and political life of mid-17th-century Venice.  Many of the subjects of his works were a reflection of the intellectual occupations of this influential Venetian society.  For instance the charged eroticism in the Young couple is likely linked to the libertine attitudes of the Accademia.His son Gasparo Prospero was born on 8 May 1653 and became a minor painter, musician, music theoretician and mathematician.  Pietro della Vecchia also had four daughters one of whom died young.Della Vecchia died on 8 September 1678 in Venice and was buried in the church of S. Canciano."

        "content": "Della Vecchia was a versatile and prolific painter who worked in many genres and created altarpieces, portraits, genre scenes and grotesques.  He relied on the assistance of a large workshop, which explains his large output as well as the fact that many of his works are known in multiple versions.  He dated his religious paintings but not his other works, which makes it difficult to understand the evolution of the artist in these other genres.During his career the artist worked in a variety of artistic styles and absorbed many influences including from contemporary artists as well as artists from the previous century.  He combined in his work the monumentality of the 16th century Venetian art of artists such as Titian and Tintoretto with the dramatic effects of the style of the Caravaggisti.  In line with the Venetian Baroque his works tend to push the sentiments of the depicted figures to the extreme.  This penchant for exaggeration, even the grotesque, was central to della Vecchia's mature style and was influential on other artists.  The artist developed a unique style, which was characterised by its pursuit of artistic virtuosity, and often depicted subject matter which was unusual and esoteric.  These features explain the high demand for his work by the more discerning Venetian collectors of his time.\nHis earliest known works include two representations of Saint Francis, which display clear Caravaggesque tendencies.  Some paintings of this early period show an affinity with those of an anonymous artist likely of French origin, the so-called Candelight Master, who can perhaps be identified with Trophime Bigot.  It is assumed that during his presumed stay in Rome from 1621/2 to 1626 he may have been in contact with French followers of Caravaggio active in Rome such as Trophime Bigot and Claude Vignon. The first dated work by della Vecchia is the Calvary in the church of San Lio in Venice, and is dated 1633:  It still shows the influence of Carlo Saraceni and Jean Leclerc, his presumed masters.The influence of Bernardo Strozzi becomes noticeable in his work after 1630.  This is apparent in the Angel Offering a Skull to St Giustina, who stands between St Joseph and St John (1640, Accademia, Venice) painted for the church of San Giustina. From 1640 to 1673 he painted designs for some the mosaic depictions inside the St. Mark's Basilica.  A development towards greater drama was visible after 1650.  The works of that time draw again on the Caravaggesque models he followed at the start of his career.  The apex of this evolution is apparent in the two remaining works of the cycle of seven paintings that the artist executed between 1664 and 1674 for the second cloister of the Jesuit church in Venice.  The paintings represent the Conversion of Francis Borgia (Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Brest) and Marco Gussoni in the Ferrara lazaretto (location unknown).  The macabre themes, the effects of spectral lights and the suffocating lack of space in the compositions are unique in Venetian painting of the seventeenth century, comparable only with the morbid paintings of the Milanese or Neapolitan schools. After this cycle his later paintings appear without inspiration and derivative from the painter's earlier works.  Of greater interest are some historical paintings of this period, which show in the bold brushstrokes and the bright and dazzling palette the influence of the leading 17th-century Venetian painter Francesco Maffei, who died in 1660. Other works of his later period show the influence of Giambattista Langetti and the group of tenebrosi active in Venice around 1660.\nDella Vecchia had a notable interest in Venetian masters including Titian and Giorgione. This interest was likely nurtured during a stay as an assistant in the workshop of Padovanino. For his skill in imitating the works of Giorgione, his friend Marco Boschini coined for him the nickname 'simia da Zorzon', meaning 'ape of Giorgione'.  Giorgione was called Zorzon in the Venetian dialect. According to Boschini, della Vecchia abused of his skill in imitating the older Venetian masters.  Boschini recounts that when the art dealer Francesca Fontana was assembling a collection for Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici he was given a 'Giorgione self-portrait'.  This portrait was actually an imitation by della Vecchia painted from his own features.  When the deceit was discovered, della Vecchia claimed he was solely trying to emulate Giorgione and that he had produced the work 30 years earlier for his father-in-law Nicolas R\u00e9gnier.  Nicolas R\u00e9gnier, who  was not only a painter but also an art dealer, had sold the painting.  Thirty years later, it was believed that the work was in fact a genuine Giorgione.  It appears therefore that della Vecchia's imitations could very well be regarded in certain cases as attempts to pass off the imitations as originals.  His friend Boschini regarded these imitations, often executed in a remarkably ingenious manner, as displays of virtuosity. Other artists whose works della Vecchia and his workshop regularly imitated included Titian, Romanino, Palma Vecchio, Paris Bordone and Jacopo Bassano.  His imitations of Giorgione offer an important insight into the manner in which that artist's work was perceived in the 17th century.  It is believed that none of della Vecchia's works in the style of Giorgione were based on now lost compositions of Giorgione but were 'original' creations in the style of Giorgione.Della Vecchia was known for his paintings of soldiers (referred to as 'bravi') with broad feathered hats of which he made many versions and variations.  Some of these paintings depict individual soldiers while others show soldiers in genre scenes such as fortune telling, playing dice etc.  The innumerable repetitions of these works depicting warriors and other popular figures created by his workshop had a negative impact on his posthumous reputation.  Della Vecchia painted not only imaginary portraits of bravos, but also of philosophers, pages and courtesans. These portraits are an expression of the Venetian Baroque's taste for eccentric subject matter.  They also represent the artist's reaction to the expressive head portraits (tronies) by Caravaggio and Rembrandt.\nThere are about eight pictures by della Vecchia in which the landscape is the primary subject. These include four idyllic landscapes that presage the Rococo style (now in the Pinacoteca Querini-Stampalia) and the Rocky Landscape with Warriors in the Hermitage.  Two further landscapes were auctioned at Dorotheum on 20 October 2015 as lot 279.  These latter works are executed in a painterly technique, reminiscent of the 'picturesque' style of late 16th-century artists Titian and Jacopo Bassano. The two compositions likely do not depict a particular story, but are rather an evocation of a romanticised wild countryside, frequented by intrepid warriors wearing fantastic costumes.Della Vecchia maintained close links with the members of the Accademia degli Incogniti.  Their philosophical occupations were reflected in the iconography of some of his paintings of the 1650s and 1660s. In some works he treated the mathematical, philosophical and cabalistic ideas in a serious manner and in others he ridiculed them through salacious images.  For example in the Allegory of architecture (1654, Accademia Carrara di Belle Arti di Bergamo), which depicts a half-naked woman crouched over a book on a ledge with an old man and another half-naked woman seeming to beseech her, he gives expression to some of those ideas."

        "content": "He was born to the artist Ignazio Fumagalli and his wife, Marianna n\u00e9e Bernasconi. Following in his father's footsteps, he attended the Accademia di Brera, where he studied with Luigi Sabatelli. He received several awards from 1834 to 1836 and had his first exhibition at the Accademia in 1837, with nine commissioned portraits. He continued to exhibit there until 1860.\nAfter being harshly criticized for a mythological painting in 1840, he began to focus on historical subjects. His exhibition in 1842, featuring a commission from the Duke of Litta, was one of his most successful. In 1843 and 1844, he included some genre scenes.\nIn 1848, he expressed his sympathy with the Revolution and those who wanted to free Northern Italy from the Austrian Empire. Together with Alessandro Durini, he created a lithograph depicting a major victory against the Austrians. The proceeds from its sale were donated to help nurse wounded soldiers.After 1851, he developed a tendency to paint in small formats, and was influenced in his choice of subject matter by the Venetian painter, Francesco Hayez. In 1859, following Italy's liberation from Austria, with the French as allies, he presented a painting of Carlo Goldoni giving Italian language lessons to the daughter of King Louis XV. This was followed in 1860 with portraits of Napoleon III and the soon-to-be King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel II. \nHis works are poorly documented after that time. There is a self-portrait and an unidentified fresco from 1867, a portrait of Dr. Giovanni Clerici, at the Ospedale Maggiore, from 1871, and a scene showing Admiral Vettor Pisani in prison, from 1872. Many sources give his year of death as 1876, even though he is listed as a participant in the National Exhibition of 1881.He actually died in 1886, at home, and is buried at the Cimitero Monumentale di Milano next to his wife, Pierina n\u00e9e Soresi."

Through the use of these materials, she explores the ways people assign function and connotations to things. \u201cObjects have personal and cultural meaning because they absorb our stories and reflect our humanity back to us. My stories, your stories, our stories are held in the object,\u201d says Clark.Clark is perhaps best known for artwork that honors contemporary craftspeople, like hairdressers, and notable African American figures. She has studied with craftspeople in places like Australia, Brazil, China, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, and Indonesia, where she learned about their mediums, tools, technique, and cultural associations. In her work, craft and community and intertwined; many of her projects involve participation and promote collaboration across racial, gender, and socioeconomic lines.\nOne of Clark's artist statements describes her work as follows: I use craft and materials to investigate identity. Simple objects become cultural interfaces. Through them I navigate accord and discord. When trying to unravel complex issues, I am instinctively drawn to things that connect to my personal narrative as a point of departure: a comb or a strand of hair. Charged with agency, simple objects nave the mysterious ability to reflect or absorb us. I find my image, my personal story, in an object. But it is also the object's ability to act as a rhizome, the multiple ways in which it can be discovered or read by a wide audience that draws me in. To sustain my practice, I milk the object, its potential, its image, and its materiality. I manipulate the object in a formal manner to engage the viewer in conversation about collective meaning. If we unravel a cloth together, what do we learn in the process? What is the connection between combs, hair, and textiles? Can a strand of hair tell a life story or a whole cultural history? I trust that my stories, your stories, our stories are held in the object. In this way, the everyday \"thing\" becomes a lens through which we may better see one another. A visual vocabulary derived from object and image forms a language ranging from the vernacular to the political to the poetic.\""

        "content": "Xavier Caf\u00e9ine is a French Canadian rock vocalist, multi instrumentalist, composer and producer from the province of Quebec. He is the primary songwriter and lead singer of his band Cafeine and has also released music under alternate spellings; Caf\u00e9ine, Xavier Caf\u00e9\u00efne, or Caf\u00e9\u00efne. Xavier received formal Jazz-Pop bass training at the C\u00e9gep Marie-Victorin school in Montreal. His first release was the indie-punk album Mal \u00e9duqu\u00e9 mon amour in 1998 sung entirely in French. The follow-up album Pornstar was released in 2000, leaning toward a more glam rock sound, with English lyrics.\n\nIn August 2006, he released Gis\u00e8le on Indica Records as a solo project. Once again Xavier wrote the music, sang and performed most of the instruments on his album. Additional drums were recorded by his friend Michel Langevin of Voivod. Gis\u00e8le considered a classic French-language punk rock album, earning two ADISQ 2007 nominations for \"Best Rock Album of the Year\" and \"Best Male Artist\", and winning the GAMIQ 2007 award for \"Best Rock Album\". The Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada awarded him the \"2008 Discovery of the Year Song\" award for \"La fin du monde\".Cafeine's most recent album New Love was released again on Indica Records in 2013. The album was produced by Gus Van Go, giving the sound a crisper, more modern electro-punk-pop-rock sound. Singles \"New Love\", \"Electric\" and \"L'ettre D'Amour\" each reached the top 15 French-Canadian Commercial Alternative Radio BDS charts. New Love was primarily recorded in English with alternate French language versions for \"Electric\" and \"L'ettre D'Amour\".  On February 17, 2015, New Love was digitally released in the US, marking the first time Cafeine's music received domestic distribution in a territory outside of Canada. The USA album cover art was changed from a photo of Cafeine to a blown out photo of a headless angel. A cover version of The Gun Club's song Sex Beat was included as a bonus track.\nAs a live performer, Cafeine is known for his high-octane-punk intensity. Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec quoted \"he is still a beast on stage\" referencing Toronto's alternative weekly NOW Magazine who declared \"Cafeine is amazing, what a beast on stage\". Established as a beloved personality, Cafeine regularly makes live appearances on French-Canadian music television such as Radio-Canada Television's show Stereopop or MusiquePlus specials such as Pop de jam.In 2007, Belgian singer Plastic Bertrand contacted him to collaborate on the writing and composing of his new album \"Dandy Bandit\". Together they wrote seven songs. The two remain good friends, periodically performing together live as recently as June 24, 2015 in Montreal for the annual St. Jean Baptiste holiday. The free outdoor concert was attended by over 15,000 people in the streets of the Villeray area of Montreal and presented by La fete national dans Villeray 2015.Other producer & songwriting collaborations include two albums for French-Canadian punk band Gazoline, \"Futurbabymama\" (2012) and their self-titled album Gazoline (2014)."

He was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge in 1843.Goldie graduated from Cambridge University in 1847 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and was ordained as a priest in the Church of England. He was priest in charge at High Toynton, Lincolnshire in 1851 and then from 1852 to 1866 he had the same position at St Thomas's Church, Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire. He was vicar of St Ives (then in Huntingdonshire) from 1866 until his death there in 1886. Goldie's tenure at St Ives was controversial and his \"ritualistic proceedings\" alienated many of the congregation; he also attempted to impose church rates and was consistently and successfully opposed on that and on his candidates for the post of churchwarden in \"stormy\" parish meetings that attracted hundreds of people.Goldie's first-class cricket career was accidental. In the 1846 University Match between Cambridge University and Oxford University, held at Oxford, the Cambridge batsman John Walker did not appear for the match; the Cambridge team batted one man short in the first innings, but Goldie was co-opted to bat at No 11 in the second innings, and scored one run.Goldie married Harriet Nicol, the daughter of a Bengal Army colonel, in 1848; among their children was John Goldie, who won fame in rowing at Cambridge and at Henley and after whom the Goldie second string Cambridge University rowing team is named.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Cardinal Borgia belonged to a well-known family of Velletri, where he was born, and was a member of the collateral branch of House of Borgia of Velletri.  His early education was controlled by his uncle Alessandro (1682\u20131764), Archbishop of Fermo. From his youth, Stefano Borgia manifested an aptitude for historical research and a taste for relics of ancient civilizations, a line in which he succeeded so well that, at the age of nineteen, he was received into the Academy of Cortona.\nHe founded a museum in Velletri, in which, during his whole life, he gathered coins and manuscripts, especially Coptic, and which may be considered his major undertaking and achievement. Such was his passion for antiquities that he is known to have sold his jewels and precious earthenware in order to secure the coveted treasures and have the description of them printed. Borgia placed his scientific collection at the disposal of scholars, regardless of creed and country, and gave them encouragement and support. Paolino da San Bartolomeo, Adler, Zo\u00ebga, Heeren, and many others were among his enthusiastic friends.\nBorgia was not left entirely to his chosen field of activity, and was called to fill several important political positions. \"He was admitted on all hands to be facile Princeps of the Sacred College.\" Benedict XIV appointed him Governor of Benevento. In 1770 he was made secretary of the Congregation de Propaganda Fide, an office of which he took advantage to acquire antiquities by the help of the missionaries\u2014a help which proved always forthcoming.\nHe was made a cardinal in 1789. In the period of the French invasion, Borgia was given charge of Rome by Pius VI (1797\u201398). After the proclamation of the Republic, he was arrested (1798), but quickly released, whereupon he immediately resumed his studies and work of collecting; soon afterwards he joined Pius VI in Valence, Dr\u00f4me, and endeavoured to have this pontiff send to Asia and Africa a body of missionaries who would preach the Gospel and gather various monuments.\nCardinal Borgia was a participant in the Papal conclave, 1800, which elected Pope Pius VII. Borgia helped him in the reorganization of the Papal States. In 1801 he was made Rector of the Collegium Romanum, and he was in the retinue of Pius VII when this pontiff went to France to crown the new emperor Napoleon. Having arrived in Lyons, Cardinal Borgia was taken ill and died. After his death his collection of Coptic manuscripts was divided: the non-Biblical manuscripts were taken to Naples and placed in the Biblioteca Borbonica, now the Biblioteca nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III; and the Biblical manuscripts, except for a few which were taken to Naples by mistake, given to the Congregation de Propaganda Fide, together with the collection of coins and monuments forming the Museo Borgiano.At the half of the 19th century, the manuscripts of the Museo Borgiano were transferred to the Vatican Library, where they are found today. Before the partition of the manuscripts was made the scholar and convert, Georg Zo\u00ebga, wrote a complete and accurate description of them in his posthumous work Catologus Codicum Copticorum manuscriptorum qui in Museo Borgiano Velitris adservantur (Rome, 1810). Borgia also published several works bearing especially on historical topics.\nThe museum of Stefano Borgia in Velletri was also famous for the Charta Borgea which begins Papyrology in the west and the Codex Borgia, discovered by Alexander von Humboldt, is named after him."

In 1830, he moved to Paris, entered the Conservatory and there followed a course in harmony. After some time studying counterpoint and fugue under Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis, and composition under Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Le Sueur, whose second daughter, Louise Eug\u00e9nie F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Lesueur (1808\u20131884), he would marry on 17 October 1833, he won second prize in 1834 and the Prix de Rome in 1836 for his cantata Velleda, which was performed at the Conservatoire on 8 October that same year.\nDespite the success of his musical debut, his career as a composer was short-lived. Boisselot had already assumed the management of his family business in Marseille and Barcelona, following the death of his brother Louis-Constantin (1809\u20131850), himself a successor to their father Jean-Louis (1782\u20131847), music publisher and musical-instrument manufacturer in Montpellier and Marseille. His achievements brought him many awards at exhibitions, such as one silver medal at the Paris Exposition of 1839, one gold medal at the French Industrial Exposition of 1844 and again at the London Great Exhibition of 1851. The quality of his grand pianos at home granted him a first class medal at the Exposition Universelle (1855), where his products were among the best of France and Spain.\nPoor financial operations and the Barcelona fire of 1855 put the company in difficulty. Boisselot retired that same year and passed the management of his factories over to his nephew, Franz Boisselot (1845\u20131902), whose godfather was Franz Liszt, and who completely restored his business to a prosperous situation, delivering 600 to 800 pianos per year, with a large number destined for export. In 1867, he was appointed inspector-general of music schools and music theatres in Marseille. Having not abandoned his compositions, he played in 1869 in Marseille, fragments of a lyrical epic entitled L'Ange d\u00e9chu.\nHe died in Paris."

        "content": "Nnadubem Gabriel Enyinaya Muoneke (born 7 February 1978, in Ann Arbor, Michigan) is a Nigerian American professional basketball player. Despite being born in the United States, Muoneke represents Nigeria internationally.\nMuoneke attended Cypress Falls High School in northwest Houston, Texas. After graduation, he enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin, from which he graduated in 2000 with his degree in Petroleum Engineering. After starting for 4 years on the school's basketball team, Muoneke went undrafted out of college. He is ranked in the top 15 in the history of University of Texas basketball in both scoring and rebounding. He was a first round pick of the Columbus Riverdragons (now Austin Spurs) then the Roanoke Dazzle also of the NBDL. He has played in multiple NBA summer leagues including that of the Vancouver Grizzlies and the New Orleans Hornets. Muoneke also signed non-guaranteed NBA contracts with the Detroit Pistons, Houston Rockets, Charlotte Bobcats and the Utah Jazz but was waived from all four teams.\nMuoneke has played around the world, including with the Ponce Lions in Puerto Rico, P\u0131nar Kar\u015f\u0131yaka in Turkey, the Beijing Olympians in China, Busan KTF Magic Wings, Seoul SK Knights in South Korea, Caceres in Spain and Saba Battery in Iran, among other places.\nSince November 2007, Muoneke has been maintaining a blog on Hoopshype.com, where he discusses his playing career, life in foreign countries, and politics.\nIn Winter 2007-08 he signed a contract with '07-'08 ACB Champion and Euroleague Final Four Participant, Saski Baskonia of the Spanish ACB to replace the injured James Singleton. When the contract expired, the team's renewal offer was not accepted by Muoneke and both parties mutually parted ways.\nDuring his time in China, Muoneke broke many scoring records and was amongst the top scorers in China in all three of his seasons in the country. While playing for the Yunnan Running Bulls, Muoneke was physically attacked during a postgame confrontation between himself and Chinese national team captain and Shanghai Sharks player Liu Wei. After Muoneke and the Sharks' Cai Liang wrestled for the ball during the game, Cai, Liu and some Sharks players confronted Muoneke, his wife, children and mother-in-law as they were leaving the stadium. Muoneke had a water bottle thrown at him, before being chased and cornered by the players. Liu and Cai were subsequently fined and suspended. The Shanghai Sharks were also fined. Muoneke was not injured.He signed with ASVEL Villeurbanne for the 2008-09 season, but was released in September.  He then signed with the Utah Jazz but was waived in October.\nOn his blog in 2009, he alluded to a retirement from professional basketball  and subsequently did retire at the age of 30.\nMuoneke then continued his career in African oil and gas in 2010 and has apparently started his own company in his parents' home country of Nigeria."

        "content": "Originally, Catania was not a traditional Mafia area such as the western part of Sicily. According to Antonino Calderone, the first Mafia family in Catania was started by Antonio Saitta. He had been prosecuted by Mussolini\u2019s Iron Prefect, Cesare Mori. One of his daughters was the mother of Giuseppe and Antonino Calderone. Another uncle had helped the Mafia get back on its feet after World War II, organizing the black market in contraband cigarettes.\nAntonino Calderone, narrating his initiation ritual in Catania in 1962, recalls that he was surprised to see at the gathering people he knew and he never suspected were in the Mafia, and not to see people he thought were in the organization. Calderone owned a gas station and entered profitable business ventures thanks to his Mafia connections, and rose through the ranks of the Calderone family until he became underboss of the Catania Mafia.\nOn 8 September 1978, his brother and boss of the Catania Mafia, Giuseppe Calderone, was killed by his former close friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nitto Santapaola. Santapaola had forged an alliance with the Corleonesi and took over the command of the Catania Mafia Family. This was the beginning of a campaign of violence targeting the established Sicilian Mafia families which culminated in the 1981 killing of Stefano Bontade, a close ally and personal friend of the Calderone brothers, which led to the Second Mafia War.\nCalderone became more and more marginalized and decided to leave Catania in 1983 fearing for his life. With his wife and three children he moved to Nice in France, where he ran a Laundromat. On May 9, 1986, he was arrested in Nice."

Suddenly, he began screaming for a prison guard and demanded to see the head of the prison. He said he wanted to talk to judge Giovanni Falcone. Calderone was moved to an insane asylum for his own protection.\nOn 9 April 1987, Falcone \u2013 together with French prosecutor Michel Debaq sat face to face with Calderone in a Marseille prison. After an initial refusal to talk, Calderone suddenly said, \"I know a lot about the Mafia, because I am a member of it.\" Once he started, Calderone talked for almost a year.\nFalcone flew once a week to Marseille, taking some 1,000 pages of deposition from Calderone. Calderone proved to be a remarkably accurate witness. More than 800 details were checked. On March 19, 1988, Falcone issued 160 arrest warrants on the basis of the testimony of Antonino Calderone."

        "content": "While previous pentiti had all been from Palermo, Calderone described the grip of Cosa Nostra in Catania, the main city and industrial centre on Sicily's east coast. He testified about the relationship between the Mafia and the four Cavalieri del Lavoro (Knights of Labour) of Catania: the construction entrepreneurs Carmelo Costanzo, Francesco Finocchiaro, Mario Rendo and Gaetano Graci \u2013 who needed the mafiosi for protection. Construction sites of rival companies were bombed and at least one rival of Costanzo was assassinated.Calderone also talked about the links of Cosa Nostra with law enforcement, freemasonry, judges and politicians in Catania and the Italian government. \"We in Catania, when we had a problem with the judiciary, we would turn to the local Masonic head. We knew that many magistrates were lodge members and that, thanks to the local chief, we could even interfere with ongoing criminal proceedings,\" Calderone said.\nThe Catanese Mafia was generally able to learn about arrest warrants before they were issued and sometimes have names crossed off the list. When they needed a false passport they turned to \u2018their\u2019 member of parliament in Rome, Giuseppe Lupis of the small Democratic Socialist Party. Lupis was one of the top vote-getters in Catania.According to Calderone the late 1970s were a turning point in the relationship between the Mafia and politics. The Mafia started to feel superior and politicians could not refuse requests for favours."

While they expressed no regret for their crimes, Calderone seemed to suffer from genuine remorse.\nAs the brother of a Commission member, Calderone knew a lot about the workings of Cosa Nostra and confirmed the essential role of the Commission in the major assassinations of the 1970s and 1980s. He provided first-hand accounts of the leaders of the Corleonesi, Luciano Leggio, Tot\u00f2 Riina and Bernardo Provenzano. \"The Corleone bosses were not educated at all, but they were cunning and diabolical,\" Calderone said about Riina and Provenzano. \"They were both clever and ferocious, a rare combination in Cosa Nostra.\"One of the more bizarre anecdotes Calderone related in his memoirs was that of Riina giving a tearful eulogy at the funeral of his murdered brother, even though Riina himself had ordered the killing. Yet, Riina's admiration for Giuseppe Calderone might have been sincere: he regretted having to have him killed, just as a president of a company regrets having to lay off a valued employee during difficult economic times.\nCalderone\u2019s most explosive revelation was about Salvo Lima, prime minister Giulio Andreotti\u2019s chief lieutenant in Sicily, and the Salvo cousins, wealthy tax collectors on the island. He described how he and his brother conferred with Lima and the Salvo cousins to get a zealous police officer in Catania transferred."

In 1992 he published a book with Antimafia sociologist Pino Arlacchi about his life in Cosa Nostra, that was translated in many languages. These memoirs read like a handbook for understanding Cosa Nostra and the life of a mafioso.\nAfter the murder of Giovanni Falcone, Calderone gave a little noticed but accurate analysis of the attack: \"Such a spectacular public bombing is never in the interest of the Mafia \u2026 it is a sign of weakness.\" The killing had become necessary because of a series of major defeats, according to Calderone. \"Falcone had been condemned to death a long time ago, but the sentence could no longer be put off for two reasons: the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to confirm the life sentences of the bosses of the Commission \u2026 and the increasing certainty that Falcone would be super-prosecutor. As long as convictions could be overturned in Rome, there was no need to act. But a definitive life sentence unleashed a reaction of rage. The Corleonesi and the winning families lost their heads.\" He went on to predict that other killings would soon follow: \"Cosa Nostra has a little book and for every name there is a time.\""

He and Paxton worked together also in Streets of Fire, an American neo-noir rock musical film directed and co-written by Walter Hill. Rossovich's next movie was Losin' It, a \"teenage romp down to Mexico... and [Rossovich] played a marine who the kids kept coming across, and which resulted in some high jinks.\" Losin' It was Tom Cruise's first lead role. Rossovich and Cruise, who Rossovich considers \"a great guy,\" first met on the set of Losin' It. The two would become friends, and go on to star together in Rossovich's biggest hit and one of Tom Cruise's most memorable works, Top Gun. On the set of Top Gun, Rossovich also \"really bonded with Val Kilmer,\" partly due to their respective roles in the movie and the relationship of their characters. Rossovich has stated that bonding with Kilmer came \"so naturally,\" and that he and Kilmer were \"kind of like brothers.\" In 1984, Rossovich was cast as Ginger's boyfriend Matt in The Terminator. Between The Terminator and Top Gun, Rossovich starred in Streets of Fire, where he plays Officer Cooley, and meets again with Bill Paxton; the sci-fi horror film Warning Sign, where he plays Bob; the action film Let's Get Harry, in which he plays Kurt Kleein; and the neo noir mystery film The Morning After, where he plays 'the Detective.'"

In 1949, they crossed the already-fortified border to resettle in Hanover, West Germany (as recounted in his song \"Renegade\" on the album Steppenwolf 7). Now living in the British occupation zone, the young Joachim, who had eye problems and could not speak or understand English, was first inspired by and learned about rock 'n' roll music while listening to Little Richard on U.S. Armed Forces radio. When his family moved to Toronto in 1958, teachers had a hard time pronouncing his birth name, so he was called John K instead. Five years later, they moved to Buffalo, New York."

He was an officer of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in Batavia (Jakarta) as well as a talented naturalist.  Born into an influential Dutch family, his father was Jacob Cornelis Radermacher (1700-1748), who was treasurer-general to the prince.  His uncle and his nephew were members of the Board of Directors of the VOC.  In 1757, then only sixteen years old, he had traveled to Indonesian to work as a merchant for the VOC. On 21 May 1761 Jacob married Margaretha Sophia Verijssel.  In 1762 Radermacher created a Freemasonic circle in Batavia becoming the first Freemasonic lodge in Asia.  In 1763 he returned to Holland to continue his studies, and graduated in law at Harderwijk. After graduation on 13 June 1766 he established himself as a lawyer in Arnhem.  After a short time, Radermacher made the decision to return to Batavia. On 20 December 1766 with his wife Margaretha and two sons Frans Reinier and Johannes Cornelis, they boarded the ship Tulpenburg bound for Indonesia. His youngest son, Johannes Cornelis, still an infant, died within one month of their departure. By 1776, Radermacher was promoted by the VOC to title of \"Extra-Ordinair Council of India\".\nDuring his years in Batavia, Radermacher was a staunch promoter of the arts and sciences in the Far East.  On 24 April 1778 he founded the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences (\"Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en etenschappen\"). He also donated a substantial amount of writings and collections to start the museum.  During this time he also catalogued a significant amount of flora and fauna of the islands of Java and Sumatra.  The trees of the genus \"Radermachera\" are named for him.\nBy 1781 Radermacher was named Commissioner Concerning the Fleet and the Army, and Common Council of India.  After the death of his first wife, he married Bataviase Anna Bosch.  For health reasons in 1783, he requested permission to return to Holland.  However, while en route home in the Indian Ocean on 24 December, there was a mutiny on board the ship and Radermacher was murdered."

During the party's first official meeting in Recoaro on 9 December 1979, Tramarin gave a famous speech titled Venetian Autonomy and Europe: \"Today for Venetians the moment has come, after 113 years of Italian unitary colonization, to take their natural and human resources back, to fight against the wild exploitation that has brought emigration, pollution and rooting out from their culture\".In 1983 he was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies and thus became the first deputy of his party's history. Soon after the election Franco Rocchetta, who had been behind the scenes up to that moment and was disappointed by his missed election, hinted that Tramarin should step down from the post of party leader. After a power struggle, Rocchetta won the battle for the party's leadership and Tramarin was replaced as national secretary by Marilena Marin, future wife of Rocchetta. Subsequently, Tramarin, while continuing to represent Liga Veneta in the Italian Parliament, was ousted from the party and formed Liga Veneta Serenissima, which proved to be a very unsuccessful political party, gaining only 0.2% of the vote in the 1985 regional election.Tramarin never joined Lega Nord but had been active in Liga Veneta Repubblica, a minor Venetist party led by Fabrizio Comencini.\n\n\n== References =="

After a brief feud between the two, Iha sustained a friendly and close relationship with Wretzky, citing her as a best friend.\n\nIha wrote and sang a number of Smashing Pumpkins' songs, such as: \"Blew Away\" on Pisces Iscariot, \"Bugg Superstar\" on Vieuphoria, \"Take Me Down\" on Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, \"...Said Sadly\", \"Believe\", \"The Boy\", and \"The Bells\" on The Aeroplane Flies High, \"Summer\" on the \"Perfect\" single and \"Go\" on Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music.  He co-wrote with Billy Corgan \"I Am One\" on Gish, \"Soma\" and \"Mayonaise\" on Siamese Dream, \"Plume\" on Pisces Iscariot and \"Farewell and Goodnight\" on Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. He sang the band's covers of the Cure's \"A Night Like This\" and Syd Barrett's \"Terrapin\". During his time with the Pumpkins, Iha recorded with other bands, including Ivy, to which Adam Schlesinger contributed, and Swedish New Wave band the Sounds.\nBilly Corgan has claimed that Iha played very little guitar on the first two Smashing Pumpkins albums, with Corgan himself playing most of the parts in the studio that Iha played live.Iha was often considered the \"quiet one\" in Smashing Pumpkins, but he was known to engage in ad-libbed jokes and rap sessions at live performances.  His humor was encapsulated in his use of the catchphrase, \"I've seen a million faces, and I've rocked them all,\" originally from the Bon Jovi song \"Wanted Dead or Alive\".In 1998, Iha released a moderately successful solo album, Let It Come Down. One music video was produced from this album, for the song \"Be Strong Now\", which was released as a four-track single.\nWhen his former bandmates Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin revived the \"Smashing Pumpkins\" name, Iha did not participate, and in fact had not spoken to Corgan in years. Corgan stated in a 2008 blog entry that when he and Chamberlin reunited, the \"door was open\" for Iha to rejoin, but he declined, and Corgan said that he \"can now say definitively that Iha isn't ever coming back.\" However, in a 2012 interview about the band reformation, Iha stated that he was never even asked back into the band in the first place. Iha also admitted within the interview that he has not heard any of the band's new music since the reformation.\nIn a March 2013 interview, he was asked about looking back at the band's history and explained that he never really thought about his former success with the band, but did look back with fondness when asked about the 6 studio albums he made with them.  He revealed that he and Corgan had not spoken in around ten years, but that he did speak to Wretzky \"once in a while\".\nOn March 26, 2016 and March 27, 2016, Iha joined Corgan and Chamberlin on stage unannounced at back to back Smashing Pumpkins shows at the Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. Iha played a third show with the band in their hometown of Chicago at the Civic Opera house on April 14, 2016. In 2017, reunion rumors were leaked through various sources, and in 2018, Iha was spotted with Corgan, Chamberlin, and current Smashing Pumpkins guitarist Jeff Schroeder in the studio and at a photo shoot, confirming his return to the band.  In summer 2018, the reunited band embarked on the Shiny And Oh So Bright Tour, which was followed at the end of the year by the release of their album Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun.  Iha would go on to also record Cyr with the reunited lineup, which was released in November 2020."

Osborne played a few more games that season, deputising for Ray Martin who was nearing the end of his Birmingham career, but his defending was not considered up to standard and he was allowed to leave. He then spent a season with Port Vale where he played the opening six games of the season for the Third Division side. After losing his place in September 1976 he did not get another game until April the next year, though he did play nine of the last ten games. He left on a free transfer in May 1977, moving into non-League football with Hillingdon Borough and Westfields."

Ru\u00edz initially worked for (CMLL) as Rencor Latino in 1995, but did not achieve any significant success until he adopted the ring name Averno in June 2001. Under his new ring name, Ru\u00edz went on to become a one\u2013time CMLL World Middleweight, CMLL World Trios Champion, NWA World Middleweight Champion and NWA World Historic Middleweight Champion and a three\u2013time CMLL World Tag Team Champion. His ring name is most commonly translated as \"Hell\" in English.\nFor many years Averno's real name was not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. However, in May 2011, Averno was booked in a Lucha de Apuesta, where he lost his mask and was forced to reveal his true identity. Ru\u00edz left CMLL in April 2014 and joined rival promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) the following month."

For nearly a decade he was in charge of a squadron on the Uruguay River, using the schooner Oriental as his flagship. He prepared for the Portuguese invasion of 1816, which resulted in the defeat of the troops led by Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas and the annexation of the Banda Oriental to the Kingdom of Brazil as the Cisplatina province. He was considered a consummate planner, especially in the area of combined operations with land forces. His personality, education, and intelligence led him to be involved in many activities, such as diplomacy.\nSimilar to many Portuguese soldiers active in the Cisplatina province, he married a woman from the region, Eugenia Gadea Paredes from the Soriano Department.\nDuring the Cisplatine War, he was named commander of the Third Division, the Brazilian naval squadron in the Uruguay River. He suffered a major defeat against admiral William Brown in the Battle of Juncal, after which he was taken prisoner. After refusing to give an oath of submission, he succeeded in escaping, and in 1829 he was one of those who entered the plaza of Montevideo as a result of the Preliminary Peace Convention.\nHe died extremely poor, at the age of 66.\n\n\n== References =="

AD 921).  However Ibn Hawqal was more than an editor, he was a travel writer writing in the style followed later by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri in his Kitab al-Mas\u0101lik wa-al-Mam\u0101lik, a literary genre which uses reports of merchants and travellers. Ibn Hawqal introduces 10th century humour into his account of Sicily during the Kalbid-Fatimid dynasty. As a primary source his medieval geography tends to exaggeration, depicting the \"barbaric and uncivilised\" Christians of Palermo, reflecting the prevailing politics and attitudes of his time. Yet his geographic accounts of his personal travels were relied upon, and found useful, by medieval Arab travellers.\nThe chapters on al-Andalus, Sicily, and the richly cultivated area of Fraxinet (La Garde-Freinet) describes in detail a number of regional innovations practiced by Muslim farmers and fishermen.\nThe chapter on the Byzantine Empire\u2014known in the Muslim world as, and called by the Byzantines themselves, the \"Lands of the Romans\"\u2014gives his first-hand observation of the 360 languages spoken in the Caucasus, with the Lingua Franca being Arabic and Persian across the region. With the description of Kiev, he may have mentioned the route of the Volga Bulgars and the Khazars, which was perhaps taken from Sviatoslav I of Kiev. He also published a cartographic map of Sindh together with accounts of the geography and culture of Sindh and the Indus River."

During World War two he was not able to produce a film because he was Jewish.At the end of the Second World War, Braunberger transformed a local Gestapo office into the Cinema Studio  \"Studio Lhmond\", which he used to discover new talents of the \"nouvelle vague\", including Jean-Pierre Melville, Jean-Luc Godard and Alain Resnais.\nIn 1966 he was the head of the jury at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival.Braunberger had a close relationship with philosopher Gilles Deleuze.\nIn the late 1970s, Braunberger produced two films for Polish filmmaker Walerian Borowczyk.\nBraunberger died in 1990."

        "content": "Hunt grew up in East Orange, New Jersey in a tenement house. Hunt served in World War I in France. After spending time in Greenwich Village, he moved to Provincetown, Massachusetts in the late 1920s with his parents Ma and \"Pa\" (Edward C.) Hunt.  Pa Hunt began painting in 1929, and his na\u00efve art oil painting Peter Hunt's Antique Shop, 1930-34 was acquired by the MOMA in 1941.In the 1930s, Hunt expanded his business to include several storefronts and workshop space called \"Peter Hunt's Peasant Village.\"He painted old furniture, household items, and fabrics, decorating them with colorful peasant designs, reminiscent of Pennsylvania German and French Provincial folk art. Hearts, flowers, fruits, birds, angels, and pretty maidens and their suitors adorned hutches, cabinets, dressers, tables, chairs, stools, wooden trays, fabrics, tins, and metalware. Hunt further embellished some of those pieces with pseudo-French phrases scrawled across their surfaces.\nWith his artistic talent, good looks, charm, wit, and knack for outrageous storytelling, Hunt wooed and delighted wealthy matrons and high-society tastemakers vacationing on Cape Cod. They found him irresistible, and his cheerful designs the perfect look for their summer cottages. Hunt\u2019s clients were rich and influential; among them were Boston socialite Frances Brown Merkel and New York cosmetics diva Helena Rubinstein, both of whom helped advance Peter Hunt\u2019s name and reputation.\nHe employed young artists to decorate pieces in his signature style, and upscale New York department stores began carrying his furniture and knickknacks. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Hunt\u2019s star shone brightly. \" One of Hunt's employees was a salesman surnamed Pelkey, which inspired Pelkey's daughter Alice Brock to become a Provincetown artist herself\u2014decades after her incidental brush with fame as the titular owner of Alice's Restaurant.Peter designed the \"Cape Cod Room\" restaurant of Chicago's Drake Hotel in 1935, bringing Cape Cod artifacts and painting murals of the sea. His gained popularity in the 1930s and 1940s when he encouraged women to re-make furniture during the economically challenging times of the Great Depression and World War II.  His Peter Hunt's Workbook was published in 1945 by Ziff-Davis Publishing Company.  In the 1950s interest in the peasant style waned, and Hunt sold his Peasant Village shops and moved to Orleans, Cape Cod where he opened a shop called Peacock Alley.  Peter Hunt died almost penniless in 1967.\nToday Hunt's works are collectible and sell at auction for up to thousands of dollars.  LaGina Austin, an American folk art specialist, described as work as \"folksy and attractive to kitschy almost corny.\" To recognize a Hunt original, collectors should luck for his rounded cursive signature \"Peter Hunt\" or \"anno Domini\" with the year.  He always used bright colors in styles that looked like European and Pennsylvania Dutch folk art."

He is known for his own political prominence as well as that of his children and was a patriarch of the Kennedy family, which included President John F. Kennedy, Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and longtime Senator Ted Kennedy.\nKennedy was born into a political family in East Boston, Massachusetts. He made a large fortune as a stock and commodity market investor and later rolled over his proceeds by dedicating a substantial amount of his wealth into investment-grade real estate and a wide range of privately controlled businesses across the United States. During World War I, he was an assistant general manager of a Boston area Bethlehem Steel shipyard; through that position, he became acquainted with Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. In the 1920s, Kennedy made huge profits by reorganizing and refinancing several Hollywood studios; several acquisitions were ultimately merged into Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) studios. Kennedy increased his fortune with distribution rights for Scotch whisky. He owned the largest privately owned building in the country, Chicago's Merchandise Mart.\nKennedy was a leading member of the Democratic Party and of the Irish Catholic community. President Roosevelt appointed Kennedy to be the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which he led from 1934 to 1935. Kennedy later directed the United States Maritime Commission. Kennedy served as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1938 to late 1940. With the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Kennedy was pessimistic about Britain's ability to survive attacks from Nazi Germany. During the Battle of Britain in November 1940, Kennedy publicly suggested, \"Democracy is finished in England. It may be here [in the United States].\" After a controversy regarding this statement, Kennedy resigned his position.\nKennedy was married to Rose Fitzgerald and had nine children. During his later life, he was heavily involved in the political careers of his sons. Three of Kennedy's sons attained distinguished political positions: John served as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and as the 35th president of the United States, Robert served as the U.S. attorney general and as a U.S. senator from New York, and Ted also served as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts."

During his mid to late 20s, he made a large fortune as an active commodity and stock investor; he then reinvested much of his proceeds into film studios, real estate, and shipping lines. Though Kennedy never built a significant business from scratch, his timing as both buyer and seller was nonetheless excellent.Various criminals, such as Frank Costello, have boasted they worked with Kennedy in mysterious bootlegging operations during Prohibition. Although his father was in the whisky importation business, scholars dismiss the claims. The most recent and most thorough biographer David Nasaw asserts that no credible evidence has been found to link Kennedy to bootlegging activities.

        "content": "Davidson was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, and began studying piano at age four. When he was twelve, he became the organist at the Zion Temple Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God, where his parents were pastors. He attended the Boston Latin School, graduating in 1959, then enrolled at Harvard College on a full scholarship, studying biochemistry. During this time, he began a long period of experimentation with various kinds of drugs, which may have led to the psychological issues that would later manifest themselves. After six years at Harvard, Davidson was asked to leave, as his academic performance had suffered. He apparently landed on his feet, however; Milford Graves later recalled that by 1965, Davidson was \"with a big laboratory up in Boston, with a big-time guy\".While at Harvard, Davidson became increasingly dedicated to music, and began traveling to New York City to play. During 1964, he met Ornette Coleman, and began playing with him on a regular basis. (Coleman would later refer to Davidson as his favorite pianist.) Davidson also occasionally played drums with the New York Art Quartet, substituting for Milford Graves when he was unavailable, and also played with Paul Motian, among others. (Prior to playing with Motian for the first time, Keith Jarrett heard him on a tape with Davidson; he later stated: \"it completely knocked me out\".)\nAt the recommendation of Coleman, Bernard Stollman, the founder of ESP-Disk, agreed to record Davidson without having heard him play. In July 1965, Davidson recorded his debut album, Lowell Davidson Trio (ESP 1012), featuring five original compositions, with bassist Gary Peacock and Graves on drums. Recorded in one take, it would prove to be Davidson's only commercial recording released during his lifetime.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Davidson collaborated with many musicians in both Boston and New York. He experimented with graphic and proportional notation, and assembled a book consisting of shapes created by a color copier. (Guitarist Joe Morris recalled Davidson pointing to a small part of one of his graphic scores and telling him \"if we practice for six months we might be able to play that\".) Davidson also experimented with scores made from aluminum foil riddled with pin holes and held over a light in order to \"burn the shape of the music into your synapses\".In the late 1980s, Davidson's behavior became increasingly erratic, and he was hospitalized at the psychiatric unit of Boston City Hospital. He later contracted tuberculosis, which went untreated, and died on 31 July 1990 at age 48. Ornette Coleman was among the attendees at his funeral, which was held at his family's church.Joe Morris studied and performed with Davidson and has described the pianist as a major influence. In 1997, Morris released Antennae, an album inspired by some of Davidson's graphic scores, with bassist Nate McBride and drummer Jerome Deupree, on the AUM Fidelity label. In 2009, Morris released MVP LSD: The Graphic Scores of Lowell Skinner Davidson on Riti Records, featuring Morris on guitar, John Voigt on bass, and Tom Plsek on trombone. In 2012, Morris released Graffiti in Two Parts, a recording of a 1985 concert in Cambridge, Massachusetts, featuring Davidson on bass and drums, Morris on guitar, Malcolm Goldstein on violin, and Butch Morris on cornet, on the RogueArt label.2014 saw the release of Rediscovered Session of 1988, on which Davidson appears with vibraphonist/pianist/drummer Richard Poole. Concerning his encounter with Davidson in the studio, Poole recalled: \"Shortly after we began recording, I realized he was multidimensional... he talked constantly and shortly took over the session. He had an unusual aura; a cloud of white sparks traveled with him as he walked around the studio talking to himself... Lowell made Sun Ra look normal.\""

        "content": "Pianist Ethan Iverson described Davidson as having \"an approach somewhere between the fury of Cecil Taylor and the romance of Paul Bley\". In a review of Lowell Davidson Trio, Jerry D'Souza wrote: \"Davidson could make the piano speak in many different ways... he let his right hand find founts of inspiration and invention in beautifully flitting notes as well as deep emphasis. Davidson did not let space dominate the intervals. He let it in judiciously.\"Raul D'Gama Rose wrote: \"Lowell Davidson was one of those quintessential artists. A pianist possessed of great virtuosity, he was also a Harvard-educated biochemist and his musical art\u2014both compositions and performance\u2014and emerged from a confluence of the two. Davidson inhabited a rarified space. He understood and played with such harmonic sophistication that he may be compared in this respect only to Thelonious Monk, Herbie Nichols and Don Pullen. As a scientist-musician he believed that musical tones, if properly employed, could influence the evolution of the brain.\"Joe Morris recalled: \"His music was much more about sound. He used to talk about the upper partials clashing together. It was very slow moving, it was much more about sounds slowly morphing into other sounds... It was... like what you would call electroacoustic improvisation now. His trio music, even though it had bass and drums, moved at a very slow pace. It had a sort of groove, but it was very different. And he operated differently. His rhetoric was very different. I don't think he ever thought of himself as a jazz musician; he just saw himself as a musician. He was a very dignified, incredibly brilliant guy. He would never lower himself to some mere label.\" Morris added: \"He was so brilliant in the way he spoke about things; it was impossible to dismiss it as just crazy talk. Even though at first it sounded like that, over time I understood what he was talking about, and we could have conversations. He used to say it was about evolution, that if we play things we haven't heard before, it will alter the biochemistry of the brain. He said that's what evolution is about... I understand that what he was really trying to do was to move humans forward.\" Regarding Davidson's funeral, Morris stated: \"The music played by the church band circled and rose to the ceiling. The sounds clashed and blended. The partials merged. It sounded like Lowell's music.\"Taylor McLean, a musician who had met Davidson at Harvard, stated that despite Davidson's personal issues, his life was \"positive and victorious.\" He recalled that Davidson lived in an \"alternative universe\" in which he was successful: \"It is a form of success that is little understood, and that brings with it no comforts. The artist is driven to pursue and formulate successive objective forms. That is the only way to cross the river and stay alive in the current. It is a form of achievement and 'success' that is incomprehensible to the normative path because it comes at great personal cost, [does not] include social status, accumulation of material goods, praise and adulation, or even a supportive social network. Lowell was a champion in this area.\""

To the best of his knowledge, Hunt remains the only person to have his photograph framed twice in the Apollo foyer, both with The Flamingos and as a solo artist. Several years, and a couple of minor hits later, Hunt sang for the U.S. Army in Germany. By 1969, he left his homeland, traveled back to Germany, through Belgium and across the English Channel to the United Kingdom."

Billings had an unusual appearance and a strong addiction to snuff.

Written as an answer to a criticism of his use of harmony, \"Jargon\" contains a tongue-in-cheek text, and jarring dissonances that sound more like those of the 20th century than of the 18th. Billings followed up \"Jargon\" with his address \"To the Goddess of Discord\".He also wrote several Christmas carols, including \"Judea\" in 1778 and \"Shiloh\" in 1781."

        "content": "Billings' work was very popular in its heyday, but his career was hampered by the primitive state of copyright law in America at the time. By the time the copyright laws had been strengthened, it was too late for Billings:  the favorites among his tunes had already been widely reprinted in other people's hymnals, permanently copyright-free.\nWith changes in the public's musical taste, Billings' fortunes declined.  His last tune-book, The Continental Harmony, was published as a project of his friends, in an effort to help support the revered but no longer popular composer.  His temporary employment as a Boston street sweeper was probably a project of a similar nature.\nBillings died in poverty at age 53, and for a considerable time after his death, his music was almost completely neglected in the American musical mainstream.  However, his compositions remained popular for a time in the rural areas of New England, which resisted the newer trends in sacred music.  Moreover, a few of Billings' songs were carried southward and westward through America, as a result of their appearance in shape note hymnals.  They ultimately resided in the rural South, as part of the Sacred Harp singing tradition.\nIn the latter part of the twentieth century a Billings revival occurred, and a sumptuous complete scholarly edition of his works was published (see Books, below).  Works by Billings are commonly sung by American choral groups today, particularly performers of early music.  In addition, the recent spread of Sacred Harp music has acquainted many more people with Billings' music: several of his compositions are among the more frequently sung of the works in the Sacred Harp canon."

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry. Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht\u2014the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)\u2014as well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD\u2014Reich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 recipients in the military forces of allies of Nazi Germany.There is currently no official German Government list of KC recipients. Analysis and acceptance of the order commission of the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR) indicates that up to 7,321 awards may have been made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. These recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel's book, Die Tr\u00e4ger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939\u20131945 [The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939\u20131945]. Fellgiebel was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, and was also the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, a second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of the recipients.\nIn 2007, Veit Scherzer published his Die Ritterkreuztr\u00e4ger 1939\u20131945 [The Knight's Cross Bearers 1939\u20131945]. Scherzer's book was compiled from documents held by the German Federal Archives, and cast doubt on 193 of the listings in Fellgiebel's 1996 book. The majority of the disputed recipients were listed as having received the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of the Third Reich during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.Listed here are the 368 Knight's Cross recipients of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS whose last name is in the range \"Ba\u2013Bm\". Scherzer has challenged the validity of 13 of these listings. This is the first of two lists of all 725 Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients whose last name starts with \"B\".

The first enactment, Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573 of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross (Eisernes Kreuz), the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (Gro\u00dfkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes). Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of the Knight's Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub), was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849 of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613 of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern) and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten). At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit goldenem Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten), based on the enactment Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11 of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of the Knight's Cross authorized."

Within each of these lists a unique sequential number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher grades of the Knight's Cross, one list per grade. Of the 368 awards made to servicemen whose last name is in the range \"Ba\u2013Bm\", 31 were later awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, 12 the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and one the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds; 19 presentations were made posthumously. Heer members received 232 of the medals; 15 went to the Kriegsmarine, 100 to the Luftwaffe, and 21 to the Waffen-SS. The sequential numbers greater than 843 for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and 143 for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords are unofficial and were assigned by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR) and are therefore denoted in parentheses. The recipients are initially ordered alphabetically by last name. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross was awarded.\n  This along with the + (plus) indicates that a higher grade of Knight's Cross was awarded as well.  This along with the * (asterisk) indicates that the Knight's Cross was awarded posthumously.  This along with the ?

He was born in Sopot, a town in the Rose Valley of Bulgaria (then part of the Ottoman Empire). The works of Ivan Vazov reveal two historical epochs - the Bulgarian Renaissance and the Post-Liberation (from Ottoman Empire rule) epoch. Ivan Vazov holds the highest honorary title of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences - Academician. He acted as Education and People Enlightenment Minister from September 7, 1897, until January 30, 1899, representing the People's Party."

        "content": "The exact date of Vazov's birth is disputed. His parents, Saba and Mincho Vazov, both had a lot of influence on the young poet.\nAfter Ivan finished primary school in Sopot, Mincho sent him to Kalofer, appointing him assistant teacher. Having done his final exams in Kalofer, the young teacher returned to Sopot to help in his father's grocery. The following year his father sent him to Plovdiv to Naiden Gerov's school. There Vazov made his first steps as a poet.\nHe returned to Sopot only to leave for Olteni\u021ba in Romania, as his father wanted him to become an apprentice and study trade at his uncle's. Ivan Vazov showed no interest in the trade profession whatsoever. Instead he was immersed in literature. Soon he fled from his uncle's place and went to Br\u0103ila where he lived with the Bulgarian exiled revolutionaries and met Hristo Botev, a Bulgarian revolutionary and poet.\nIn 1874, he joined the struggle for his country's independence from the Ottoman Empire. He returned to Sopot in 1875, where he became a member of the local revolutionary committee. After the failure of the April Uprising of 1876, he had to flee the country, going back to Gala\u0163i, where most of the surviving revolutionaries were exiled. There he was appointed a secretary of the committee.\nVazov was probably heavily influenced by Botev, who was the ideological leader of the Bulgarian revolutionary movement. He started writing his famous poems with Botev and some other Bulgarian emigrants in Romania. In 1876 he published his first work, Priaporetz and Gusla, followed by \"Bulgaria's Sorrows\" in 1877.\nBulgaria regained its independence in 1878 as a result of the Russo-Turkish War and Vazov wrote the famous Epic of the Forgotten. He became the editor of the political reviews Science and Dawn. He was, however, forced into exile once again, this time to Odesa, because of the persecution of the russophile political faction. Returning to Bulgaria with the help of his mother Saba Vazova, he started teaching. Vazov's next stay was in Svishtov, where he became a civil servant.\n\nHe moved to Sofia in 1889 where he started publishing the review Dennitsa.\nVazov's 1888 novel Under the Yoke, which depicts the Ottoman oppression of Bulgaria, is the most famous piece of classic Bulgarian literature and has been translated into over 30 languages.Later in his life Vazov was a prominent and widely respected figure in the social and cultural life of newly independent Bulgaria. He died on September 22, 1921."

Seen by some as \"The Father of Economics\" or \"The Father of Capitalism\", he wrote two classic works, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work that treats economics as a comprehensive system and as an academic discipline. Smith refuses to explain the distribution of wealth and power in terms of God's will and instead appeals to natural, political, social, economic, legal, environmental and technological factors and the interactions among them. Among other economic theories, the work introduced Smith's idea of absolute advantage.Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.\nAs a reaction to the common policy of protecting national markets and merchants through minimizing imports and maximizing exports, what came to be known as mercantilism, Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by writers such as Horace Walpole."

At the end of 1999, North Sydney merged with arch rivals Manly-Warringah to form the Northern Eagles as part of the NRL's rationalisation policy.  Stringer was one of the few North Sydney players who elected to play on with the merged team.Stringer played with the Northern Eagles until the end of 2001.  He then signed for South Sydney who had just been re-admitted into the competition after they were controversially excluded from the league at the end of 1999.  Stringer played in the club's first game after readmission which was a 40-6 loss against rivals the Sydney Roosters.  Stringer played with South Sydney until the end of the 2004 NRL season although his time there wasn't successful with the club finishing last in 2003 and 2004.  Stringer then signed for Parramatta after departing Souths.Stringer was a key player in Parramatta's Minor Premiership in 2005 and again earned representative honours as a starting prop for the Country Origin side.  Stringer played in Parramatta's finals campaign which ended when the club suffered a shock 29-0 loss against the North Queensland Cowboys in the preliminary final at Telstra Stadium.Stringer's final game as a player came in round 11 of the 2006 NRL season against Penrith at Penrith Park."

Having withdrawn from the Central Coast competition and joined the much stronger Newcastle Rugby League, Stringer led the club to a grand final appearance in his first year in charge, losing to Lakes United.\nIn 2009, Stringer led the club to their first premiership in the Newcastle Premiership when he coached the side to a comprehensive victory over the heavily fancied Cessnock, 36\u20134.\nAfter leaving Wyong, Stringer returned to play with his junior club, the Berkeley Vale Panthers, the club in which he led to their very first junior premiership when he captained the under 15s when he was a goal kicking hooker.\nStringer then joined the coaching ranks at Wests Tigers in 2015, taking charge of the forwards in the Under 20s competition. Head coach Jason Taylor then promoted Stringer to take charge as coach of the Wests Tigers NSW Cup side in 2016.\nThis saw a marked improvement for the club at this level as Stringer galvanised the playing group and led them to the brink of an unlikely grand final berth, falling short with a 24-18 loss to the highly fancied Mounties with less than 3 minutes to play. Wests Tigers management again moved to promote Stringer in their coaching hierarchy for the 2017 NRL season where he took up duties alongside Jason Taylor as the assistant coach of the NRL First Grade side. Stringer left the club soon after Taylor was dismissed in 2017.\n\n\n== References =="

But he still was an unknown when given his first chance at a world championship in December 1980 in El Paso, Texas.\nHe met legendary Mexican world Featherweight champion Salvador S\u00e1nchez there. Laporte made Sanchez work hard and won a handful of rounds. He lost to Sanchez by a 15-round unanimous decision.\nLaporte then fought future world champion Rocky Lockridge in 1981 at Las Vegas, scoring a second-round knockout to become the United States Featherweight champion.\nGiven a second title shot, this time by the WBA, Laporte met the also legendary world featherweight champion Eusebio Pedroza in 1982, losing a close and controversial unanimous decision. The fight was so close that WBC president Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n decided to give Laporte a rematch vs Sanchez for the World Boxing Council's world title.\nThis rematch wasn't going to happen, because Sanchez died in a car accident the morning of August 12, in Mexico City. Then, the WBC decided to put Laporte vs. Colombian Mario Miranda for the vacant world title in a fight held at the Madison Square Garden. Laporte dropped Miranda in the tenth round and Miranda quit on his stool before the start of the 11th. Juan Laporte, the tough kid from New York who couldn't figure to become a world champ versus the legendary champions of the day, had become a world champion.\nAround this time, Laporte was sponsored by the American jeans brand, Sasson,  sporting their name and logo on his boxing trunks (shorts) during his fights.\nLaporte defended his title twice, vs. Ruben Castillo and Johnny De La Rosa, both 12 rounds decision wins, then lost it to another Puerto Rican world champion, the legendary Wilfredo G\u00f3mez.\nIn 1985, he went to Ireland, where he lost a ten-round decision to future world champion Barry McGuigan.\nIn 1986, Laporte fought Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez at the Madison Square Garden, and many thought Laporte deserved the 12-round decision that night, but he lost a unanimous decision in a contest for Chavez's WBC world Jr. Lightweight title.\nHis career went on and off after that day, and in 1989, his son died in a drowning accident. Laporte buried his title belt along with his son.\nUpon hearing this, Sulaiman sent him a new world title belt to show him support and respect from the boxing community. Around that era, on April 29, 1989, Laporte fought on the WBO's inaugural world Junior Lightweight championship bout, losing by a 12 rounds unanimous decision for the vacant title to his countryman, John John Molina, 18-2 before their fight, at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan. Laporte lost another disputed decision later on, this time to former world Jr Welterweight champion Billy Costello in 1999, and then finally retired from boxing."

Around 1917, Edith moved with her parents and nine older brothers and sisters to their brand-new house at 25th and Diamond Streets. Directly across Diamond Street, there was a large park with a baseball diamond. When the field was free, the kids in the neighborhood would start a game of baseball. The first position Edith played was shortstop. Her father, William L. Houghton, distributed goods for a large grocery company. He was also a skilled baseball player who taught his youngest daughter many techniques. As young as age six, Edith posed for photos in a baseball uniform. By the time she was eight, she dressed as the mascot for the Philadelphia police's baseball team. Family, friends, and fans dubbed Edith \u201cThe Kid.\u201dToo young to join a factory team, in 1922 the ten-year-old Edith tried out for the Philadelphia Bobbies, a semi-pro team for non-working girls. Houghton quickly became the star, her fielding and batting skills drew the attention of fans and reporters, as did her youth. Edith was the youngest on a team made up of mostly teenage girls. The Bobbies practiced in Fairmount Park, where Edith was a standout athlete and baseball player.In 1925, she and the team travelled to Japan to play baseball against men; Houghton was then 13 years old. On September 23, 1925, they boarded a train at the North Broad Street Station, several blocks from Edith's house. Twelve Bobbies, their coach, and two men (to play pitcher and catcher) played eight games on their way to Seattle, en route to Yokohama. Once in Japan, they drew large crowds, especially at first. Edith impressed many Japanese reporters. Although they were contracted to play 15 games for $800, their finances fell through midway through the trip. Half the team headed to Formosa and back to the United States. The other half, including Edith, stayed in Kobe and luckily found a contributor to fund their trip home by December."

In 1942, during World War II, she volunteered for the WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Services). Although nominally a clerk, she was accepted into the department's baseball team. The Navy newsletter wrote that \"enlisted WAVE Houghton... can make any ball team in the country.\" During her service, she was assigned to the procurement of WAVES and Navy Nurse clothing for the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts in Washington D.C. Houghton eventually became chief storekeeper. In December 1944, Houghton's unit was transferred to New York. In 1945, Houghton was discharged from the WAVES but was recruited again and became the Chief Master of Arms.\nAfter the war, she took her skills to a new level. She approached Phillies\u2019 owner R. R. M. Carpenter Jr. in 1946 asking for an interview, then met with Carpenter and general manager Herb Pennock. Soon the Phillies made national news: they hired Houghton as Major League Baseball's first female scout. From 1946 to 1952, she scouted players and signed fifteen to contracts, mostly from Philadelphia-area high schools.\nShe left the team in 1952 and rejoined the Navy, where she served during the Korean and Vietnam wars and retired as a chief petty officer.In 1964, Houghton left Philadelphia and moved to Sarasota, Florida, where she lived until her death on February 2, 2013, eight days before her 101st birthday."

He is also an advocate for U.S. space superiority, writing that \"in the 21st century, victory on land, sea or in the air will go to the power that controls space.\" and that \"if we desire peace on Earth, we need to prepare for war in space.\"He and his colleague at Martin Marietta, David Baker, were the driving force behind Mars Direct, a proposal in a 1990 research paper intended to produce significant reductions in the cost and complexity of such a mission. The key idea was to use the Martian atmosphere to produce oxygen, water, and rocket propellant for the surface stay and return journey.  A modified version of the plan was subsequently adopted by NASA as their \"design reference mission\". He questions the delay and cost-to-benefit ratio of first establishing a base or outpost on an asteroid or another Apollo program-like return to the Moon, as neither would be able to provide all of its own oxygen, water, or energy; these resources are producible on Mars, and he expects people would be there thereafter.Disappointed with the lack of interest from government in Mars exploration and after the success of his book The Case for Mars (1996), as well as leadership experience at the National Space Society, Zubrin established the Mars Society in 1998. This is an international organization advocating a human mission to Mars as a goal, by private funding if possible."

He earned a M.S. in Nuclear Engineering (1984), a M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics (1986), and a Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering (1992) \u2014 all from the University of Washington. He has developed a number of concepts for space propulsion and exploration, and is the author of over 200 technical and non-technical papers and several books. He is also President of both the Mars Society and Pioneer Astronautics, a private company that does research and development on innovative aerospace technologies. Zubrin is the co-inventor on a U.S. design patent and a U.S. utility patent on a hybrid rocket/airplane, and on a U.S. utility patent on an oxygen supply system (see links below).\nZubrin's inventions include the nuclear salt-water rocket and co-inventor (with Dana Andrews) of the magnetic sail. Zubrin is fellow at Center for Security Policy.During his professional career, Zubrin was a member of Lockheed Martin's scenario development team charged with developing strategies for space exploration. He was also \"a senior engineer with the Martin Marietta Astronautics company, working as one of its leaders in development of advanced concepts for interplanetary missions\". During his time at Martin Marietta, he drafted ideas for a potential single-stage-to-orbit spacecraft, and developed the Black Colt. However, he would eventually leave Martin Marietta to co-form Pioneer Rocketplane with Mitchell Burnside Clapp, an aerospace engineer from the US Air Force, due to a perceived lack of interest in reducing launch costs at larger aerospace firms. In his book, Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization, Zubrin would write about how both large aerospace firms, and the US Government, would fail to reduce the costs of spaceflight.\nIn 1998, Zubrin founded the Mars Society, and in the following years, was able to attract large amounts of public interest to potential human colonisation on Mars. The work of the Mars Society was successful enough as to encourage the US Government to not cut funding for several Mars rover missions."

        "content": "Sinclair was born in Rangiora, Canterbury, and educated at Rangiora High School. An off-spin bowler and useful tail-end batsman, Sinclair made his first-class cricket debut for Canterbury in the 1953\u201354 season when Matt Poore was in South Africa with the New Zealand team. His performances were moderate (108 runs at 15.42 and 10 wickets at 41.70 in five matches) and he did not appear in 1954\u201355.\nWhen Poore was away again in 1955\u201356, this time touring India and Pakistan, and Tom Burtt retired, Sinclair became Canterbury's leading spin bowler. He took 5 for 57 and 2 for 26 in the first match of the Plunket Shield season against Otago, 1 for 50 and 4 for 17 as well as his highest score of 40 in the next match against Auckland, 4 for 36 and 0 for 74 against Wellington, and 5 for 65 and 1 for 73 against Central Districts. All four matches were victories for Canterbury, which consequently won the competition. He took 4 for 73 for Canterbury against the touring West Indians, and was selected in the team for the Second and Third Tests. However, he took only one wicket (of Everton Weekes), New Zealand lost both matches, and he never played another Test. He was twelfth man in the Fourth Test, when New Zealand recorded their first Test victory.He played three matches for Canterbury in 1956-57 but took only four wickets."

        "content": "As a youth, Juneau played in the 1979, 1980 and 1981 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Pont-Rouge.Originally drafted by the Bruins in the fourth round of the 1988 NHL Entry Draft, Juneau was a star college hockey player at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where he scored 71 goals in four regular seasons and was a two-time All-American selection. He was well known for having a 4.0 grade point average and earning a degree in just three years in aeronautical engineering, despite the fact that he did not speak English when he first arrived in New York.After college, Juneau spent a year with the Canadian Olympic team while disputing his contract offer from the Bruins. The sticking point was Juneau's insistence on being paid full salary even if he was sent to the minors - a demand Boston refused, having been burned in a nearly identical situation with Wes Walz the previous year.  Then-general manager Harry Sinden was famously quoted in response to Juneau's threat to play in Switzerland instead \"Well, I hope he learns to yodel.\"  In the meantime, Juneau led Canada to a silver medal at the 1992 Albertville Games, and was the tournament's leading scorer.Juneau would eventually sign with Boston on the team's terms, and Sinden's fears proved groundless. Juneau joined the Bruins' NHL roster right after the Olympics, and never spent a day in the minor leagues during his career. He had an impressive nineteen points in fourteen regular season games at the end of the 1992 season before a strong playoff.His best season was his rookie year of 1992\u201393 with the Bruins, when, as the left winger on a powerful line with Adam Oates and Cam Neely, he had 32 goals and 102 points and set the NHL record for assists in a season by a left wing with 70, a mark Juneau held until 2022, when it was passed by Jonathan Huberdeau of the Florida Panthers. As a reward, he was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team.\nLegend has it while with the Bruins, Juneau approached Bruins legend Johnny Bucyk asking if he could wear his No. 9 in Boston. Bucyk responded \"Score 557 goals first, and then come talk to me.\"\nDuring the 1993\u201394 season, the Bruins traded Juneau to the Capitals for Al Iafrate (who played only twelve games for Boston). In 1996, he became the first player ever to be awarded a penalty shot in overtime in a Stanley Cup playoff game (although he failed to score) during the second overtime of the Capitals' four-overtime loss to Pittsburgh. Juneau was also a member of the 1997\u201398 Capitals squad that reached the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals, scoring seventeen points in twenty-one playoff games. He scored the game-winning goal in overtime against the Buffalo Sabres in the 1998 Eastern Conference Finals that sent the Capitals to the Stanley Cup Finals. The next season, 1998\u201399, with the Capitals plagued by injuries and missing the playoffs, Juneau was traded to the Sabres, who reached the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals.Juneau spent the 1999\u20132000 season with the Ottawa Senators, who signed him largely to fill the offensive gap created when Alexei Yashin was suspended for failing to honor his contract.Juneau's offensive numbers steadily declined, largely due to chronic injuries. He became a journeyman, playing for five teams in four seasons before settling with the Montreal Canadiens as a third-liner for the final three seasons of his career. He announced his retirement after the 2003\u201304 NHL season.  Juneau finished with 156 goals and 416 assists for 572 points over thirteen seasons.Juneau wore No. 90 for the majority of his career, and later admitted that his reason for choosing No. 90 was a result of his preferred No. 9 was either retired or worn by different players. The lone exception was during his stint with the Ottawa Senators when he wore No. 39. This was done as then general manager Pierre Gauthier had a policy in place where no player could wear a number higher than the goaltender. As Patrick Lalime wore No. 40, Juneau was unable to wear his customary No. 90, which he reverted to following a trade to the Phoenix Coyotes."

        "content": "Roe was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, where he attended Brown High School. After graduating, he landed a job at General Electric soldering wires.\nTommy Roe first recorded his original song \"Sheila\" in 1960 for Jud Phillips's Judd label. \"I wrote this poem for a girl I had a crush on in high school, and her name was Freda,\" recalled Roe in 2015. \"[Jud Phillips said,] 'Son, I like that song but we gotta do somethin' about that title.' So he sent me home and Aunt Sheila was visiting that weekend. The rest is history!\" The Judd single, misspelled \"Shelia\" and credited to \"Tommy Roe and the Satins,\" is simpler than the more famous hit, with a standard vocal, rhythm combo, and backing chorus. It was a regional hit but did not chart nationally.\nRoe re-recorded the song for ABC-Paramount in 1962, with a new hook: an insistent drum paradiddle modeled on the 1957 hit \"Peggy Sue.\" Roe's slight Southern accent and his interpolation of a hiccup in the vocal invited comparisons with Buddy Holly.\nThis was deliberate, according to Roe: \"Felton (producer Felton Jarvis) said, 'We're gonna do it different. You know there's a vacuum left of Buddy Holly. There are still a lot of Buddy Holly fans out there so we need to draw attention to you, so I'm gonna put Buddy Holly drums on \"Sheila.\"' I wasn't really crazy about that whole idea because I was a big fan of Buddy Holly's and I felt like we were sponging off of him and his whole sound.\"  The new arrangement of \"Sheila\" became a Billboard number 1 hit in the U.S. and Australia in 1962. A buildup of global sales of \"Sheila\" meant that the Recording Industry Association of America did not present the gold record until 1969. When \"Sheila\" became a hit in 1962, ABC-Paramount asked him to go on tour to promote the hit. He was reluctant to give up his secure job at GE until ABC-Paramount advanced him $5,000.However, in March 1963, the UK music magazine NME reported that he and Chris Montez had both been upstaged by the Beatles and their fans on a 21-day UK tour.  Late that year, Roe scored a Top 10 hit with \"Everybody\", which reached US number 3 and UK number 9, and \"The Folk Singer\" (number 4 UK) written by Merle Kilgore was also popular.\nFollowing a more successful tour of the United Kingdom by his friend Roy Orbison, Roe toured there and then moved to England where he lived for several years. In 1964, Roe recorded a song written by Buzz Cason entitled \"Diane From Manchester Square\", about a girl who worked at EMI House when it was based in London's Manchester Square. Sales of this single in the UK were poor, and it failed to chart. During the 1960s, he had several more Top 40 hits, including 1966's number 8 \"Sweet Pea\" (number 1 Canada) and number 6 \"Hooray for Hazel\" (number 2 Canada).In 1969, his song \"Dizzy\" went to number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, number 1 in Canada, as well as number 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. This transatlantic chart-topper sold two million copies by mid-April 1969, giving him his third gold disc award.Roe guest-starred in an episode of the American sitcom Green Acres, titled \"The Four of Spades\", airing on November 8, 1969.\nHis final Top 10 single, a track co-written with Freddy Weller, titled \"Jam Up and Jelly Tight\", became his fourth gold record, peaking at number 8 in the U.S. and number 5 in Canada in 1970.Although his style of music declined in popularity with the 1970s mass market, Roe maintained a following and continued to perform at a variety of concert venues, sometimes with 1960s nostalgia rock and rollers such as Freddy Cannon and Bobby Vee. He recorded numerous singles in the late 1970s and 1980s aimed at the country music market. In 1986, Roe was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.\nRoe's autobiography, originally published in 2016, named From Cabbagetown to Tinseltown and places in between, was co-written with Michael Robert Krikorian.On February 7, 2018, Roe officially announced his retirement on his Facebook page with this statement: \n\nToday I am announcing my retirement. I have so many great memories of the music and of my fans who have supported me through the years. Fifty five years to be exact. What a gift it has been for me to share this time with you. I hope my music will continue to bring a smile to your hearts and joy to your life. ...I will stay in touch through our Facebook page. But for now I am stepping out of the spotlight from scheduled concerts and interviews. Thank you again for your loyal support. I love you all, and may God Bless you. Tommy"

Hindley played List A one-day cricket for the Hampshire Cricket Board (HCB) on four occasions, making his debut against the Kent Cricket Board at Maidstone in the 1st round of the 2001 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. The following year, he played in the 2nd round of the 2002 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy against Ireland.

In his four one-day matches for the HCB, he scored 50 runs with a highest score of 38, whilst with his off break bowling, he took 3 wickets with best figures of 2 for 27.By July 2003, Hindley was unemployed. Following an injury to Shaun Udal prior to Hampshire's County Championship match against Glamorgan at the Rose Bowl, Hindley received a phone call from Hampshire whilst decorating his mother's house, asking him to play in this match. Thus, he made what would be his only appearance in first-class cricket. Hampshire began the match poorly, with Glamorgan making 437 and then bowling Hampshire out for 185, with Hindley being dismissed for 8 runs by David Harrison. Following-on in their second innings, Hampshire made 449. Hindley ended the innings not out on 68, having shared in a half century partnership with Dimitri Mascarenhas to help set Glamorgan a victory target of 198 for victory. Glamorgan failed to chase this down, with Hampshire winning by 93 runs. During the match, his hand was broken by a Michael Kasprowicz delivery, ruling him out for a month; however, he would not feature for Hampshire again in any format.\nHindley continued to play club cricket for Havant, becoming in 2018 the first person to take 500 wickets in the Southern Premier League.

He didn't seek his first nomination; rather, he was pressed by families and neighbours to let his name stand. He ran as a \"Liberal-Progressive Conservative\" candidate in the provincial general election of 1948, having been nominated by a joint constituency convention of the two parties. Soon after he took a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, he devoted his political career solely to the Liberal Party and ran successfully as a Liberal candidate for the constituency of Moosomin in the 1952, 1956, 1960 and 1964 general elections. During his career in provincial politics, he rose rapidly in prominence in public life and within the Liberal Party, becoming the leader of the provincial party in 1954, a position which he held for five years. An article describing his career in this context noted, \"The swift and dazzling rise of 37-year-old Alexander Hamilton McDonald to the leadership of the Liberal Party in Saskatchewan has no parallel in Canadian political history.\" From 1955 to 1960, he was the Leader of the Opposition and continued to hold responsible positions within the Liberal Party after his tenure as party leader. From 1964 to 1965, he served as Minister of Agriculture and Deputy Premier to Premier Ross Thatcher.\nHe resigned his seat in 1965 and later that year was appointed to the Senate of Canada representing the senatorial division of Moosomin, Saskatchewan. A Liberal, he was Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate (appointed in 1968) and Government Whip in the Senate (appointed in 1970). Throughout his parliamentary career, McDonald was active in the affairs of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the International Parliamentary Union and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. He took part in community activities as a member of the Royal Canadian Legion, the United Services Institute and the Elks Lodge.\nMcDonald died in office in 1980. His funeral \u2013 held at the United Church in Moosomin, Saskatchewan \u2013 was overflowing with dignitaries from Ottawa, the provinces and many, many locals from within the constituency. He was remembered with real affection and was genuinely liked by both sides of the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly. His honorary pallbearers included two Members elected under the NDP banner."

He was the only son of John Archer, an Irish engineer from County Tipperary, and his wife Charlotte Lee, formerly of Kent, England.The first records show that Archer, at the age of 18, was taught under the guidance of Charles Beazley, an architect based in London. Commencing in April 1809, Archer remained under Beazley's instruction for the duration of his three-year term of articles before moving on to the office of John Rennie the Elder in April 1813 in the position of drawing clerk. Archer's employment with Rennie was terminated in 1818, he returned to Ireland and worked as an engineer for over 8 years, building his reputation. Following his father's death in 1822 and the ongoing strain of the economic depression of the time, Archer sought to find employment elsewhere. His opportunity came in December 1826 when John Rennie's son recommended Archer for the position of Colonial Architect in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) as the need arose for the development of public buildings and offices to accommodate the growing convict and free-settler population of Van Diemen's Land.Upon arrival in Hobart Town on 2 August 1827, Archer immediately commenced work in the role of Civil Engineer and Architect for the colony. Alongside the high demand for prisons and other buildings of a convict nature, the rise in free settlers due to the ongoing depression called for the development of other public works to accommodate the needs of colonial life, such as police offices, public offices, military barracks and churches. For the majority of the 11 years that John Lee Archer served as Civil Engineer and Colonial Architect, he was responsible for all government commissioned buildings, many still notable today.\nArcher married Sophia Mattinson of Hobart on 3 September 1833 and the pair established a home in New Town with their many children. Due to a temporary decline in colonial revenue Archer was retrenched in 1838 and was never reinstated in his role. As others moved in to take over his responsibilities in his absence, Archer became isolated from his profession at the age of 47 with little hope of local employment opportunities.\nIn October of the same year Archer moved to north-west Tasmania and took the position of police magistrate for the district of Horton.  He stayed with this role for the remainder of his life. In 1843 he produced a map of Stanley, reproduced by Betty Jones in Along the terrace: the owners and occupiers of Stanley 1843 -1922.John Lee Archer died at the age of 61 on 4 December 1852, and is buried at Circular Head."

The relation between the evolutionary chain culminating in Homo sapiens and the estimated size of our universe (discovered in 1999 by him and the physicist Antonio Feoli) resolved a long debate in the Anthropic principle. The HS3D  dataset of Homo Sapiens DNA regions (2001) is used to assess the prediction accuracy of methods for gene identification and characterization.As active supporter of transhumanism, an international intellectual and cultural movement supporting the use of science and technology to improve human mental and physical characteristics and capacities, in 2004 he began an intense applied research program as competition bodybuilder.

When the revolt erupted, the peasants elected him to be one of the leaders, and renowned for his personal qualities, he became the most influential leader of the rebellion. During his brief tenure he showed ability as a capable administrator and inspiring leader that would later create a legend. He earned the nickname Gubec Beg.Matija Gubec led the poorly armed peasant army during its last stand at the Battle of Stubi\u010dko Polje on 9 February 1573 facing an army of the nobility led by bishop governor Juraj Dra\u0161kovi\u0107. Before the battle he made a speech trying to convince the men that only victory could bring them freedom, while the defeat would bring more misery. After the defeat he was captured and taken to Zagreb. On 15 February, under specific orders of bishop Dra\u0161kovi\u0107, he was publicly tortured and forced to wear a red-hot iron crown, cruelly dragged along the streets of the city, pinched with red-hot iron pincers, and was subsequently quartered."

During World War II, a Croatian and Slovenian brigade were named after him. He is also depicted as the protagonist of Gubec-beg (1975), the first Croatian rock opera.

        "content": "Princess Wilhelmina of Hesse-Kassel (25 February 1726 \u2013 8 October 1808) was a Prussian princess, married to Prince Henry of Prussia.\nWilhelmina was the daughter of Prince Maximilian of Hesse-Kassel and Friederike Charlotte of Hesse-Darmstadt, and the niece of William VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and King Frederick \nI of Sweden.\nShe was introduced to Henry when he visited Kassel in 1751 and was married to him on 25 June 1752 at Charlottenburg Palace. Henry's eldest brother, King Frederick the Great, insisted that his brother marry, of course equally, just as their father had once arranged Frederick's marriage against his will. He only left him the choice of which of the sisters from the House of Hesse he wanted.Wilhelmina was described as a charming beauty. Wilhelmina and Henry had their own court and lived at Schloss Rheinsberg and Berlin. Wilhelmina had no children with Henry, who was reported to pay more attention to his male friends than to her. At his marriage Henry described the situation to his siblings that he was \"changing from the captivity of the king to the captivity of marriage\". Although the whole court spied on her behavior, she always managed to appear in a good mood and not to offer court gossip a target thanks to her consistently friendly demeanor.The couple separated in 1766 after an alleged affair on Wilhelmina's side. After the separation, she lived at Prince Henry's Palais in Berlin, on the grand boulevard Unter den Linden, which the king had built for his brother between 1748 and 1753 (today the main building of the Humboldt University of Berlin). She occupied one half of the building while her husband lived in the other.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nShe was popular with her husband's family, especially his brothers, while her husband was more distant towards her. Nevertheless, the Duke of Nevers wrote about Henry: \"He shows more consideration for his wife than his brother.\" (What was meant was the behavior of the king to his wife Queen Elisabeth Christine.)\n\nThe Swedish princess Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp described her at the time of her visit in 1798: She was a tall and handsome lady with a well kept figure, though very thin, and you can still see how remarkably beautiful she was in her youth. Her eyes are big and lively though somewhat protruding, and with a restless look. She is witty and literal, but as a consequence of her age, she sometimes talks of several subjects at the same time. Her manners are regal, and she represents perfectly, and was additionally very polite and toward me very pleasant. \nShe was one of the few members of the royal house to remain in Berlin during the French occupation in 1806. While most of the royal family left, reportedly because of the anti-Napoleonic criticisms they had expressed, and the members of the royal court either followed them or left the capital for their country estates, Wilhelmina remained with Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia and his consort Margravine Elisabeth Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt because of \"their high age\" as well as Princess Augusta of Prussia, who was pregnant at the time.\n\n\n== References =="

He received his MA in German from the University of Stellenbosch, and his bachelor's and doctorates in law from University of Pretoria.Van Rensburg qualified as a solicitor and was hired as the personal secretary of Tielman Roos, the Minister of Justice.

He was greatly impressed by Hitler's leadership and the discipline he observed in Germany.\nIn 1938, he helped organize the Ossewabrandwag as a vehicle for Afrikaner nationalism though often at odds with the National Party, the main driver of Afrikaner Nationalism. Van Rensburg was the commander general of the Ossewabrandwag from 1941 until 1952. Like most members of the Ossewabrandwag, he was regarded as a German sympathizer during the Second World War. There was evidence that he'd been complicit in espionage operations by the Germans, and a treason case was built against him. However, after the war, President Jan Smuts declined to follow through on the case out of fear of turning Van Rensburg into a martyr.Van Rensburg died on 25 September 1966 in Cape Town, and was buried with military honors."

In these years he gained a number of prizes; finally in the 1878 he obtained the \"Menzione d'onore\" in painting.\nHe became a member of the Alessandria local section of the First International, and was described by the police as a \"fanatic internationalist\" that wanted to overthrow the society in order to try benefits from the riots.Achille emigrated to the United States following the repression in Italy of the First International and after having traveled through the Gulf Coast and Chicago decided to stay in New Orleans. He became a citizen in 1890 and from 1903 until his death lived at the 632 St Peter Street in the French Quarter. In the same house lived some years later the American playwright Tennessee Williams."

In 1986 he founded 2 bands: Bik Bent Braam (with Angelo Verploegen, Eric Boeren, Wolter Wierbos, Peter Haex, Carl Ludwig H\u00fcbsch, Peter van Bergen, Jan Willem van der Ham, Bart van der Putten, Frans Vermeerssen, Frank Gratkowski, J\u00f6rg Brinkmann, Michael Vatcher) and Bentje Braam.\nIn 1987 Michiel Braam was commissioned by the NOS. He composed a work for 4 clarinets and piano entitled Cows and Beasts. It was performed by Braam on piano, and the clarinet players Ab Baars, Theo J\u00f6rgensmann, Michael Moore and Louis Sclavis. In 1989 he founded Trio BraamDeJoodeVatcher (with Wilbert de Joode and Michael Vatcher), in 2005 eBraam (fka Wurli Trio, with Pieter Douma and Dirk-Peter K\u00f6lsch), and in 2011 Michiel Braam's Hybrid 10tet (with eBraam, the classical Matangi String Quartet, Taylor Ho Bynum, Carl Ludwig H\u00fcbsch and Nils Wogram). In 2015 the trio \"Nos Otrobanda\" was formed with Aty de Windt on bass and Andr\u00e9 Groen on g\u00fcira. That band specialises in Antillean Walttzes.\nTogether with Frans Vermeerssen he co-leads the sextet All Ears (with Herb Robertson, Frank Gratkowski, Wilbert de Joode and Michael Vatcher). He worked also with musicians like George Lewis, Benjamin Herman, Han Bennink, Conny and Hannes Bauer and Steve Arg\u00fcelles.\nThe orchestra Bik Bent Braam was considered to be one of the main bigger orchestras in the field of improvisation-music and performed worldwide, as the trio BraamDeJoodeVatcher still does.\nIn 2007 Braam composed Nopera, a sort of music theater piece in which the written parts could be performed at random and contained much room for improvisation, and the libretto was written in the Nothingyettish language.\nIn 2012 Bik Bent Braam stopped and a septet named Flex Bent Braam took its place. In 2013 the first program \"Lucebert\" of that band was presented on stage and with an album.\nIn 2015 eBraam recorded \"The Extraordinary Love Story of Aye Aye and Fedor\", with singer Dean Bowman as narrator, after Ana Isabel Ordonez's children's book, in a bigger project that involves also dance and fine art.\n2016 Reeds & Deeds started, with Frans Vermeerssen, Alex Coke, Bo van de Graaf, Arjen Gorter and Makki van Engelen. This sextet plays the music of Roland Kirk and issued an album in 2019, \"Live at JazzCase\".\nIn 2020 it will be 25 years ago Bik Bent Braam performed the program \"The XIJZ of Bik Bent Braam\". A special Latin version of this program will be touring during the anniversary year 2020 by the new 13-piece ensemble Son Bent Braam (including Angelo Verploegen, Jo\u00ebl Botma, Ilja Reijngoud, Efe Erdem, Efra\u00efm Trujillo, Bart van der Putten, Frans Vermeerssen, Jesse Schilderink, Aty de Windt, Andr\u00e9 Groen, Danny Rombout and Martin Gort entitled \"El XYZ de Son Bent Braam\".\nIn 1988, Braam was honoured with the Podium prize and in 1997 he got Dutch most important jazz prize, the VPRO/Boy Edgar Award."

He would be selected by his great-uncle Andrea Doria to command the family's galleys.He became the Admiral of the Genoese Fleet in 1555 and commanded the combined Christian fleet of the Holy League at the Battle of Djerba in 1560, which was won by the Ottoman Turks under the command of Piyale Pasha. He barely escaped with his life as his troops suffered a crushing defeat, the stress and shame supposedly caused the older Andrea Doria to die.He also participated in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, commanding the right wing of the Christian coalition force known as the Holy League. During the battle he allowed a gap to be formed in the Holy League's battle line which was exploited by Occhiali. Many historians have criticized Doria for opening the line, some going so far as to describe it as an act of cowardice. The battle was ultimately won by the Holy League, and signaled the first defeat of the Ottoman Turks at sea since Preveza. Doria would go on to write reports attempting to justify his actions at the battle.Using the momentum from the Battle of Lepanto, Don John and Doria would go on to capture Tunis in 1573.Doria also led an expedition against the Barbary states in 1601.Doria was a knight commander of the Order of Santiago. He was also the Marquis of Tursi and 6th (or 2nd) Prince of Melfi (both titles inherited from his relation and adoptive father, the famed Genoese admiral Andrea Doria)."

Her mother was poet and doll artist Margaret Rockwell Finch  and her father, Henry Leroy Finch Jr., was a pacifist leader and a scholar of philosophy whose works include three books on Ludwig Wittgenstein.  Her great-aunt was the socialist organizer, politician, and writer Jessie Wallace Hughan. Finch began writing poetry as a child. She was educated in public schools, then for two years at Oakwood Friends School and one year at Simon's Rock Early College, where she studied filmmaking and art history.  At Yale University she studied poetry, anthropology, the history of the English language with Marie Borroff, and Versification with Penelope Laurans, graduating magna cum laude in 1979. After traveling in Africa with painter Alix Bacon, in the early eighties she settled in New York's East Village, where she worked at Natural History Magazine and self-published and performed the rhythmical experimental longpoemThe Encyclopedia of Scotland.  In 1984, Finch encountered the work of Ntozake Shange in a bookstore and \"recognized in her a soul-mother, someone else for whom poetry was performative, sacred, curative, indispensable, physical.\" She immediately applied to the University of Houston, where Shange was teaching, and earned her M.A. in creative writing there in 1985 with a thesis in Verse Drama directed by Shange. Finch earned a Ph.D in English and American Literature from Stanford University in 1990, studying feminist theory with Adrienne Rich and pursuing a self-designed concentration in Versification under the supervision of Diane Middlebrook."

        "content": "Finch's dedication to writing in meter and her role as a scholar, editor, and critic of poetic form led some reviewers of her first books to classify her poetry within the movement known as New Formalism. Dictionary of Literary Biography named her \"one of the central figures in contemporary American poetry\" for her role in the reclamation of poetic form. But reviewers soon noticed key differences between Finch's poetry and that of other new formalist poets. Henry Taylor, for example, claimed that Finch was not a typical new formalist because she did not focus on the realities of contemporary life, and C.L. Rawlins emphasized the incantatory use of form in Eve, writing, \"Finch is a poet in her bones . . . . What she proves in Eve is that rhyme-and-meter isn't just a formerly fashionable sort of bondage, but a bioacoustic key to memory and emotion.\"  Cindy Williams Gutierrez made a similar point in a review of a later book: \u201cFinch is more shaman than formalist. She is keenly aware of the shape and sound of her poems. Whether in a chant, sonnet, ghazal, or even Billy Collins\u2019 contrived paradelle, her skill is effortless: Form is merely the skin that allows her poems to breathe with ease.\u201d Poet and critic Ron Silliman has situated Finch in the context of experimental poetry, writing, \"Annie Finch can't be a new formalist, precisely because she's passionate both about the new and about form. She is also one of the great risk-takers in contemporary poetry, right up there with Lee Ann Brown & Bernadette Mayer in her willingness to completely shatter our expectations as readers.\"  The experimental aspect of Finch's work became more evident with the publication of Spells, which includes 35 of the poems composed in the 1980s that she refers to as the \"lost poems.\" In the preface to Spells, she describes these as \"metrical and experimental poems [that]. . . did not find their audience until the avant-garde's rediscovery of formal poetic strategies just a few years ago.\"Reviewing Calendars, poet and Goddess scholar Patricia Monaghan was one of the first critics to articulate the intersection of formal poetics and spirituality in Finch's work, writing, \"Annie Finch is a traditionalist. Not in the way the word is commonly used . . . but in a strange experimental way.  An oracle, an ecstatic maenad: that is the kind of traditional poet Annie Finch is.\" \nFinch's literary archive was purchased by the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University in 2016."

Reading it has helped me understand the ways I struggled over the years to throw off the burden of misogyny on my spiritual, psychological, intellectual, political, and poetic identities. My themes are often female-centered . . . I am proud to define myself as a woman poet.\"Finch's feminism is also evident in her prose writing, editing, and literary organizing. Her first anthology A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women (1993) collected poems and essays by contemporary women poets. The \"metrical code,\" the central theory of her book of literary criticism The Ghost of Meter (1994), is cited in the article on \"feminist poetics\" by Elaine Showalter in the Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics.   Her essay collection The Body of Poetry: Essays on Women, Form, and the Poetic Self (2005) includes writings on women poets including Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Carolyn Kizer, Maxine Kumin, Audre Lorde, Lydia Sigourney, Sara Teasdale, and Phillis Wheatley, many based in feminist theory. In 1997, Finch founded the international listserv Discussion of Women Poets (Wom-Po).  She facilitated the listserv until 2004 when she passed ownership of the list to Amy King.\nIn October 2016, anticipating the #MeToo movement, Finch became one of the first victims of sexual assault in the literary world to name writers, editors, and teachers who had sexually assaulted her during her career.In 2019 Finch launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for the publication of Choice Words: Writers on Abortion, which the publisher, Haymarket Books, calls \"the first major literary anthology about abortion.\" The Kickstarter launched two days before Alabama passed an abortion ban and reached its fundraising goal in the first week. Choice Words was published in April 2020.\nClaire Keyes notes in Scribner's American Writers, \"A strong current in [Finch's] work is the decentering of the self, a theme which stems from her deep connection with the natural world and her perception of the self as part of nature.\"  In an interview Finch stated, \"Some of my poems are lyric, some narrative, some dramatic, and some meditative, but all are concerned with the mystery of the embodied sacred.\". Finch writes in the preface of her 2013 collection Spells: New and Selected Poems that she considers her poems and verse plays to be \"spells\" whose rhythm and form invite readers \"to experience words not just in the mind but in the body.\"Finch started a blog called American Witch in 2010  and has published several articles about earth-centered spirituality in The Huffington Post."

Building on the work of Roland Barthes and on John Hollander's theory of \"the metrical frame,\" Finch calls her theory of metrical meanings \"the metrical code.\" The essay collection The Body of Poetry explores further topics in feminist poetics and poetic form including translation, \"Metrical Diversity,\" and readings of poets including Sara Teasdale, Phillis Wheatley, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Marilyn Hacker, and John Peck. Finch's edited or coedited anthologies of poetry and poetics include A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women, An Exaltation of Forms: Contemporary Poets on the Diversity of Their Art, Villanelles, and Measure for Measure: An Anthology of Poetic Meters. She has also authored a poetry-writing textbook, A Poet's Craft: A Comprehensive Guide to Making and Sharing Your Poetry. At a time when Emily Dickinson was the only nineteenth-century woman poet receiving critical attention, Finch's 1987 article \"The Sentimental Poetess in the World: Metaphor and Subjectivity in Lydia Sigourney's Nature Poetry\" approached Sigourney through postmodern theories of the poetic self. A subsequent essay on Sigourney was commissioned for Lydia Sigourney: Critical Essays and Cultural Views (2018), which also included Finch's elegiac poem for Sigourney.

He started 11 games for the Devils in the 1987\u201388 season, including an overtime victory against the Chicago Blackhawks on the final night of the season that qualified the Devils for their first Stanley Cup playoff series.\nDubbed a \"rookie sensation\", Burke helped the Devils go on a strong playoff run, defeating the division-leader New York Islanders in the first round in six games and then the Washington Capitals in seven games. The Devils were one game away from the Stanley Cup Finals but lost in Game 7 of the Wales Conference Finals to the Boston Bruins. Burke's play was widely heralded, with The Hockey Digest stating, \"Burke is now the franchise for the Devils, and to whatever heights he rises, the Devils will rise with him,\" and in December 1988, Burke became the first Devil to appear on its cover.Because he played just 11 games in the 1987\u201388 regular season, Burke maintained his rookie status for the 1988\u201389 season. That season, he was named to the 1989 All-Star Game.\nBurke played for the Devils through the 1990\u201391 season, then sat out the 1991\u201392 season requesting a trade.  Instead, he joined coach Dave King and  played for the Canadian national team in the Winter Olympics for a second time, backstopping Canada to a silver medal. Teammates on the 1992 Olympic team included future NHL players Eric Lindros and Joe Juneau. \nOn August 28, 1992, Burke was traded to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for Bobby Hol\u00edk, a second-round pick in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft (used to select Jay Pandolfo) and future considerations. He played there (and with the relocated Whalers team, the Carolina Hurricanes) for six seasons. He was voted Whalers' team MVP from 1993 to 1997. Burke then played with several teams, including the Philadelphia Flyers, Vancouver Canucks and Florida Panthers. He subsequently signed with the Phoenix Coyotes and played there for five seasons, where he was a finalist for the Vezina Trophy and third finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy in the 2001\u201302 season.Burke was selected to represent the Arizona Coyotes in the 2000-01 and 2001-02 NHL All Star games. \nAfter that, Burke played for the Philadelphia Flyers (for the second time) recording his 300th career NHL win (the 20th goaltender to reach this milestone), and the Tampa Bay Lightning. Burke was placed on waivers by Tampa Bay before the 2006\u201307 season but was not picked up. He then played for Tampa Bay's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons.  Burke was placed on waivers by the Lightning and picked up off re-entry waivers by the Los Angeles Kings.\nBurke announced his retirement from professional hockey on September 18, 2007.\nBurke currently sits #15 on the list of all time games played for NHL goaltenders (820) #30 all time wins (324) #50 all time shutouts (38) and #5 all time penalty minutes for goaltenders (310)"

In the 1960s he met Cornelius Cardew; Parsons attended Cardew's experimental music classes at Morley College since 1968. In 1969 Cardew, Parsons and fellow composer Howard Skempton founded the Scratch Orchestra, an experimental free ensemble devoted to performing contemporary music.

Parsons was among the Orchestra members who refused to be associated with the Maoist politics Cardew was propagating, and left. In 1970 Parsons started working as visiting lecturer in the Fine Art department of the Portsmouth Polytechnic and in the Slade School of Art, University College London. In 1974 he and Skempton formed a duo to perform their own works. In 1996\u201397 Parsons was a bi-fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge. During this time he organised concerts at Kettle's Yard, Cambridge. Since the early 1960s Parsons has also been active as a writer on music; his writings include a number of important articles on contemporary English composers.\nParsons' music is influenced by Anton Webern, composers of the so-called New York school (John Cage, Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff), various English composers he met through Cardew and the Scratch Orchestra, and, since the Portsmouth years, \"Systems\" artists such as Malcolm Hughes and Jeffrey Steele."

His career in the public service progressed with increasingly responsible positions becoming the Vogt of Farnsburg from 1624 to 1626 and of Riehen from 1626 to 1635. In 1635 he became senior guild master in the city of Basel, and by June 1645 he was elected its Mayor, which he stayed for twenty-one years. In 1661 he supported the purchase of the extensive collections included in the Amerbach- Cabinet with public funds."

He was not buried in the M\u00fcnster in Basel as his wife, but in the Barf\u00fcsser Church. He is generally acknowledged as one of the most competent Swiss politicians of his era, but also as a prominent exponent of the absolutist tendencies within the Swiss Confederacy.\nAssociated with Switzerland's independence, Wettstein's name first became prominent around 1750, and reached its zenith during World War II, when the country's sovereignty was challenged once more.\nA bridge bearing his name was built across the Rhine in Basel in 1881. In addition, a memorial-fountain, a local square and a street beside the bridge, as well as a march of the Basler Carnaval were named after Wettstein."

After taking care of the cinematography of the second unit for the peplum film Romulus and Remus (1961) by Sergio Corbucci, he began his career as cinematographer with two other peplum films, both directed by Alberto De Martino, Due contro tutti (1962) and Perseo l'invincibile (1963).In mid-1960s, he started working in more significant films, such as Un uomo a met\u00e0 by Vittorio De Seta and Le stagioni del nostro amore by Florestano Vancini. Di Palma later reached the peak of his career in the 1970s, when he signed the cinematography of notable titles such as Lina Wertm\u00fcller's The Seduction of Mimi, Valerio Zurlini's Indian Summer and Ettore Scola's Ugly, Dirty and Bad.The tragic suicide of his son, who had been his assistant on the set of the Scola's film, sank him into a depression and away from work. Later Di Palma never returned to major productions, working mainly for Italian television and prematurely ending his career at the beginning of the nineties."

        "content": "In 1957, O'Donnell and his wife, the former Edith Jones (1926\u20132020), a graduate in psychology from the University of Texas at Austin, founded the O'Donnell Foundation, with the principal goal of improving higher education in Texas. The two contributed tens of millions of dollars, much of it anonymously, toward various educational entities, both public and private. The O'Donnell Foundation is the fifth largest independent foundation in Dallas. In 1983, the UT regents established the Peter O'Donnell Jr., Centennial Chair in Computing Systems.\"No one in history has had a greater impact on science and engineering in Texas than Peter O'Donnell,\" said J. Tinsley Oden, the mathematician and engineering professor and director of the UT Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences. \nO'Donnell also worked to seek the expansion of the University of Texas at Dallas into a four-year institution and in obtaining the since defunct Superconducting Super Collider near Waxahachie in Ellis County south of Dallas. The trust is rooted in Mrs. O'Donnell's inheritance. In 2016, the couple resigned from leading the O'Donnell Foundation, according to their profile at the Texas State History Museum Foundation.In 2008, O'Donnell was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and received a doctor of humane letters from Southern Methodist University in University Park, Texas. He served on the National Academy of Sciences and was a founding member, along with former U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, of the Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas, which distributes annual awards to outstanding scholars in those fields. In 2013, O'Donnell received the Distinguished Service Award from Texas Exes, the alumni association of the University of Texas. He was the director and member of the executive committee of University Medical Center, Inc. He was the former director of Dallas Biomedical Corporation, InterFirst Bank, and Stadium Associates.In 2013, UT announced the naming of the O'Donnell Building for Applied Computational Engineering and Sciences. The O'Donnell Foundation has given more than $135 million to UT alone between 1983 and 2013. UT President William C. Powers declared the O'Donnells \"among the greatest supporters of the University of Texas in its 130-year history. Their transformative generosity is based on the belief in our power to change society for the better.\" In 2008, O'Donnell pledged $18 million to finance the hiring of UT faculty members undertaking research in the use of mathematics, computers, and multiple scientific disciplines; his pledge was matched by W. A. \"Tex\" Moncrief Jr., an oilman and philanthropist from Fort Worth. The Arts and Technology Building at UT-Dallas was named in 2013 in Edith O'Donnell's honor.In March 2022, the O\u2019Donnell Foundation made a $100 million gift to UT Southwestern Medical Center to endow a new school of public health. It is the largest gift to any school of public health at a public university in the U.S."

        "content": "O'Donnell was a Texas delegate to the 1960 Republican National Convention in Chicago, which nominated the Nixon-Lodge ticket. He was an alternate delegate to the New Orleans convention in 1988, which nominated George Herbert Walker Bush and Dan Quayle. In the fall of 1960, O'Donnell was the Dallas County Republican chairman and compiled a record of considerable success. His responsibility was to recruit party workers to get out the vote for Nixon-Lodge and John Tower for the U.S. Senate, with whom O'Donnell was politically close.In 1963, prior to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, as the state party chairman O'Donnell tried to convince the Republican National Committee to host the 1964 convention in Dallas, but received little support in his endeavor. The Dallas Chamber of Commerce doubted that the $500,000 needed to make a serious bid for the convention would be cost-effective. O'Donnell said he would try again in 1968 if his 1964 bid failed. It was not until 1984 that the GOP held its convention in Dallas, when delegates renominated the Reagan-Bush ticket.\nO'Donnell's friend and political ally, Jack Crichton, the 1964 Texas Republican gubernatorial nominee against the later Republican convert John B. Connally Jr., describes O'Donnell as a \"skilled organizer who located people around the nation who were in a position to promote the Goldwater cause.\" The director of the committee was New York City attorney F. Clifton White. After his nomination on July 15, 1964, at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, California, Goldwater, in Crichton's words, \"with boundless energy campaigned vigorously selling his belief in less government control, supported private enterprise, and increasing capital investment, [and] halting the drift toward socialism and increasing our national debt.\"O'Donnell served on the 1964 Republican national platform committee. Another Texan, Albert Bel Fay of Houston, was a member of the credentials committee in 1964 and was thereafter the Texas Republican national committeeman. In 1964, O'Donnell supported George H. W. Bush of Houston in his losing race for the U. S. Senate, first in the primary against Jack Cox, the 1962 Republican gubernatorial nominee, and then in the general election against the Democratic incumbent, Ralph Yarborough. The 1964 general election was a Republican disaster in Texas; with the defeats of U.S. Representatives Bruce Alger and Ed Foreman, the party was reduced to a single seat held by Frank Kell Cahoon of Midland in the 150-member Texas House of Representatives. Republican John Tower continued to hold the other Senate seat once filled by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1968, Chairman O'Donnell led the Nixon supporters in his state at the national convention in Miami Beach, Florida. This placed him in conflict once again with Jack Cox, the leader of the burgeoning forces backing Ronald Reagan in his first brief bid for the nomination. The 1968 Republican defeats in Texas, Hubert Humphrey won the state's electoral votes, and Conservative Democrat Preston Smith was elected governor over Republican Paul Eggers, led to calls to replace O'Donnell as chairman in 1969.By 1972, the Republicans hoped once more to rebound in Texas. Albert Fay lost the Republican primary for governor to former Democrat State Senator Henry Grover, also of Houston. In turn, Grover was defeated in a fairly close vote by the Democrat Dolph Briscoe, but John Tower won a third term in the Senate.In 1978, he was a key advisor to the narrow election of Bill Clements, the Dallas industrialist who became the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction. In 1987, still an advisor to Clements in the first year of Clements' second nonconsecutive term, O'Donnell convinced the governor to abandon an unpopular proposal for higher taxes.Over the years, O'Donnell has donated to various Republican candidates for office throughout the nation, including $245,000 between 2001 and 2010 to retiring Texas Governor Rick Perry. In 2011, O'Donnell, who usually kept a low public profile, criticized some of Perry's education proposals as \"absurd\", including replacing tenured faculty with lower-paid instructors, tying faculty bonuses to student evaluation of instruction, establishing a new accreditation of universities by an agency yet to be created, and the offering of an undergraduate degree that costs no more than $10,000.In 2013, the O'Donnell Foundation named Dallas attorney Tom Luce as its chief operating officer. Formerly the chief of staff to the Texas Select Committee on Public Education, Luce was named in 2005 as the assistant United States Secretary of Education under Margaret Spellings by U.S. President George W. Bush. He was chairman of the National Math and Science Initiative. In the spring of 1990, Luce was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, won by Clayton W. Williams Jr., of Midland, who then lost the general election to the Democrat Ann W. Richards.\nFormer UT President Larry Faulkner calls O'Donnell:\n\nMy candidate for the living Texan with the greatest impact on modern Texas. He built the Republican Party of Texas from zero, essentially, to the point where it won every statewide office. He has focused strongly on improvement of the universities, the schools, and moving education into a modern form at a modern level. And he has been interested in transformation of the economy and has done all he can to support bringing high-technology businesses into the state.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Chambrun was a lawyer at the Court of Appeals of Paris and the New York State Bar Association. By 1935, he helped establish a Franco-American cultural center in New York City to promote bilateral relations. The center was aimed at students and businessmen.When the Second World War broke out, Chambrun served as a captain, but with the collapse of France looming by mid-May 1940, French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud sent Chambrun as a special emissary to Washington to stiffen President Roosevelt's resolve to help the Allies. Between his first meeting with Roosevelt on 16 June and his last on 1 August, Reynaud's government had fallen. Later that year, Chambrun published the book I Saw France Fall, which helped to alert American opinion about the fate of his country.\n\nAfter the Liberation of France and the consequent fall of Laval's collaborationist government, Chambrun was a defender of Laval: Father-in-law wants a big trial which will illuminate everything, if he is given time to prepare his defence, if he is allowed to speak, to call witnesses and to obtain from abroad the information and documents which he needs, he will confound his accusers.\nThe Chambruns threw themselves into the task of assisting Laval in his defense before the High Court of Justice. After Laval's sentence and execution in October 1945, Chambrun was put on police watch in Paris on the suspicion that he may have helped the Nazis during the war. In 1942, Chambrun had been named on a list of French collaborators with Germany to be killed during the war or tried after it. By 1947, Chambrun officially applied for a US passport.Meanwhile, Chambrun and his wife devoted their energies over the following decades to the cause of his rehabilitation in the eyes of history. For example, he wrote a letter to President Dwight Eisenhower in which he objected to his characterisation of Laval as \"Hitler's most evil puppet\" in his 1948 memoir entitled Crusade in Europe. Chambrun based his argument on another book, authored by Spanish Foreign Minister Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er, in which the latter quoted Hitler describing Laval as \"no better than De Gaulle.\" By 1949, Eisenhower agreed to remove the passage from subsequent reprints. A decade later, in 1959, his wife wrote the foreword of Tout ce qu'on vous a cache, a book based on \"German secret files\" authored by Jacques Baraduc, Laval's lawyer. The book attempted to show that Laval \"refused repeatedly to yield to German demands for a reduction in the number of United States agents in French North Africa and a limitation on their activity.\"In 1969, Chambrun made an appearance in Marcel Oph\u00fcls's documentary on collaboration between the Vichy government and Nazi Germany during World War II, The Sorrow and the Pity (Le chagrin et la piti\u00e9). Chambrun wrote three books on the subject between 1983 and 1990. The Chambruns set up a foundation, the Jos\u00e9e and Ren\u00e9 de Chambrun Foundation, which collected documents on Laval for publication by the Hoover Institution. After Laval's death, the Chambruns brought flowers to his grave every 15 October to commemorate the day that he was executed.After World War II, Chambrun was hired by Peter II of Yugoslavia when the latter filed for divorce in 1953; the couple reconciled two years later. He represented the fashion designer Coco Chanel when she sued manufacturer Pierre Wertheimer to regain the marketing rights to her perfume, Chanel No. 5. Wertheimer settled the case, and Chanel became a millionaire as a result. In 1970 Chambrun defended Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos over false allegations that he killed his ex-wife, Eugenia Livanos. Additionally, Chambrun was hired by Somerset Maugham's daughter to prove that she was indeed his daughter.Chambrun served as the chairman of Baccarat, the crystal manufacturer, from 1960 to 1992."

In 1935, he bought the Ch\u00e2teau de la Grange-Bl\u00e9neau, a castle in the commune of Courpalay in the Seine-et-Marne d\u00e9partement of France, from his cousin, Louis de Lasteyrie, a descendant of La Fayette, with a life tenancy.Upon Louis de Lasteyrie's death in 1955, Chambrun discovered the large cache of documents in the attic of the castle and founded a private museum about Lafayette. News of his discovery brought many historians to his door, but Chambrun denied access, except to Andr\u00e9 Maurois whom he authorized to write a biography of Adrienne de Lafayette. Chambrun produced a book by using the documents that he had discovered; they covered the period of 1792\u20131797, when Lafayette was in an Austrian prison. He organized and described the family archives, a collection dating from 1457 to 1990. The papers were microfilmed at La Grange in 1995 and 1996, for the Library of Congress.  It took two years and several microfilm teams from the Library of Congress to film the 50,000 pages. There are now two major \"Lafayette collections\" in the world: one is at the Fondation de Chambrun; the other, originally assembled by Elie Fabius, at Cornell University Library. Chambrun purchased a sword used in battle by Lafayette in 1976, outbidding the Smithsonian Institution.Chambrun served as the honorary president of the Sons of the American Revolution in France. He became a Chevalier (knight) of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.\nChambrun died on 19 May 2002 in Paris, France. His funeral, held at Sainte-Clotilde, was attended by Diana Mitford, the widow of British fascist leader Oswald Mosley. He was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery."

A. Hayek, was an Austrian-British economist and political philosopher who made contributions to economics, political philosophy, psychology, intellectual history, and other fields. Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for work on money and economic fluctuations, and the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena. His account of how prices communicate information is widely regarded as an important contribution to economics that led to him receiving the prize.During his teenage years, Hayek fought in World War I. He later said this experience, coupled with his desire to help avoid the mistakes that led to the war, drew him into economics. He earned doctoral degrees in law in 1921 and political science in 1923 from the University of Vienna. He subsequently lived and worked in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany. He became a British citizen in 1938. His academic life was mostly spent at the London School of Economics, later at the University of Chicago, and the University of Freiburg. He is widely considered a major contributor to the Austrian School of Economics.Hayek had considerable influence on a variety of political movements of the 20th century, and his ideas continue to influence thinkers from a variety of political backgrounds today. Although sometimes described as a conservative, Hayek himself was uncomfortable with this label and preferred to be thought of as a classical liberal. As the co-founder of the Mont Pelerin Society he contributed to the revival of classical liberalism in the post-war era. His most popular work, The Road to Serfdom, has been republished many times over the eight decades since its original publication.Hayek was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1984 for his academic contributions to economics. He was the first recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 from President George H. W. Bush. In 2011, his article \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the American Economic Review during its first 100 years."

        "content": "Hayek's influence on the development of economics is widely acknowledged. With regard to the popularity of his Nobel acceptance lecture, Hayek is the second-most frequently cited economist (after Kenneth Arrow) in the Nobel lectures of the prize winners in economics. Hayek wrote critically there of the field of orthodox economics and neo-classical modelisation. A number of Nobel Laureates in economics, such as Vernon Smith and Herbert A. Simon, recognise Hayek as the greatest modern economist. Another Nobel winner, Paul Samuelson, believed that Hayek was worthy of his award, but nevertheless claimed that \"there were good historical reasons for fading memories of Hayek within the mainstream last half of the twentieth century economist fraternity. In 1931, Hayek's Prices and Production had enjoyed an ultra-short Byronic success. In retrospect hindsight tells us that its mumbo-jumbo about the period of production grossly misdiagnosed the macroeconomics of the 1927\u20131931 (and the 1931\u20132007) historical scene\". Despite this comment, Samuelson spent the last 50 years of his life obsessed with the problems of capital theory identified by Hayek and B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, and Samuelson flatly judged Hayek to have been right and his own teacher Joseph Schumpeter to have been wrong on the central economic question of the 20th century, the feasibility of socialist economic planning in a production goods dominated economy.Hayek is widely recognised for having introduced the time dimension to the equilibrium construction and for his key role in helping inspire the fields of growth theory, information economics and the theory of spontaneous order. The \"informal\" economics presented in Milton Friedman's massively influential popular work Free to Choose (1980) is explicitly Hayekian in its account of the price system as a system for transmitting and co-ordinating knowledge. This can be explained by the fact that Friedman taught Hayek's famous paper \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" (1945) in his graduate seminars.\nIn 1944, he was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy after he was nominated for membership by Keynes.Harvard economist and former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers explains Hayek's place in modern economics: \"What's the single most important thing to learn from an economics course today? What I tried to leave my students with is the view that the invisible hand is more powerful than the [un]hidden hand. Things will happen in well-organized efforts without direction, controls, plans. That's the consensus among economists. That's the Hayek legacy\".By 1947, Hayek was an organiser of the Mont Pelerin Society, a group of classical liberals who sought to oppose socialism. Hayek was also instrumental in the founding of the Institute of Economic Affairs, the right-wing libertarian and free-market think tank that inspired Thatcherism. He was in addition a member of the conservative and libertarian Philadelphia Society.Hayek had a long-standing and close friendship with philosopher of science Karl Popper, who was also from Vienna. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated: \"I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps Alfred Tarski\". Popper dedicated his Conjectures and Refutations to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, to Popper and in 1982 said that \"ever since his Logik der Forschung first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology\". Popper also participated in the inaugural meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society. Their friendship and mutual admiration do not change the fact that there are important differences between their ideas.\nHayek also played a central role in Milton Friedman's intellectual development. Friedman wrote: My interest in public policy and political philosophy was rather casual before I joined the faculty of the University of Chicago. Informal discussions with colleagues and friends stimulated a greater interest, which was reinforced by Friedrich Hayek's powerful book The Road to Serfdom, by my attendance at the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, and by discussions with Hayek after he joined the university faculty in 1950. In addition, Hayek attracted an exceptionally able group of students who were dedicated to a libertarian ideology. They started a student publication, The New Individualist Review, which was the outstanding libertarian journal of opinion for some years. I served as an adviser to the journal and published a number of articles in it....\nWhile Friedman often mentioned Hayek as an important influence, Hayek rarely mentioned Friedman. He deeply disagreed with Chicago School methodology, quantitative and macroeconomic focus, and claimed that Friedman's Essays in Positive Economics was as dangerous a book as Keynes' General Theory. Friedman also claimed that despite some Popperian influence Hayek always retained basic Misesian praxeological view which he found \"utterly nonsensical\". He also noted that he admired Hayek only for his political works and disagreed with his technical economics; he called Prices and Production a \"very flawed book\" and The Pure Theory of Capital \"unreadable\".  There were occasional tensions at the Mont Pelerin meetings between the Hayek's and Friedman's followers that sometimes threatened to split the Society. Although they worked at the same university and shared political beliefs, Hayek and Friedman rarely collaborated professionally and were not close friends.Hayek's greatest intellectual debt was to Carl Menger, who pioneered an approach to social explanation similar to that developed in Britain by Bernard Mandeville and the Scottish moral philosophers in the Scottish Enlightenment. He had a wide-reaching influence on contemporary economics, politics, philosophy, sociology, psychology and anthropology. For example, Hayek's discussion in The Road to Serfdom (1944) about truth, falsehood and the use of language influenced some later opponents of postmodernism.\nSome radical libertarians had a negative view of Hayek and his milder form of liberalism. Ayn Rand disliked him, seeing him as a conservative and compromiser. In a letter to Rose Wilder Lane in 1946 she wrote:Now to your question: 'Do those almost with us do more harm than 100% enemies?' I don't think this can be answered with a flat 'yes' or 'no,' because the 'almost' is such a wide term. There is one general rule to observe: those who are with us, but merely do not go far enough are the ones who may do us some good. Those who agree with us in some respects, yet preach contradictory ideas at the same time, are definitely more harmful than 100% enemies. As an example of the kind of 'almost' I would tolerate, I'd name Ludwig von Mises. As an example of our most pernicious enemy, I would name Hayek. That one is real poison.\nHayek made no known written references to Rand.Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales was influenced by Hayek's ideas on spontaneous order and the Austrian School of economics, after being exposed to these ideas by Austrian economist and Mises Institute Senior Fellow Mark Thornton.In the 21st century, some libertarian political scientists argue that Hayek would be in favor of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies due to its resistance to political pressure and due to Hayek's emphasis of sound money and competition in currencies. They also argue that cryptocurrency and Bitcoin serve as a \"Hayekian Escape,\" a method that the people can use to escape the government's currency monopoly."

Upon the close of World War II, Hayek restarted a relationship with an old girlfriend, who had married since they first met, but kept it secret until 1948. Hayek and Fritsch divorced in July 1950 and he married his cousin Helene Bitterlich (1900\u20131996) just a few weeks later, after moving to Arkansas to take advantage of permissive divorce laws. His wife and children were offered settlement and compensation for accepting a divorce. The divorce caused some scandal at LSE, where certain academics refused to have anything to do with Hayek. In a 1978 interview to explain his actions, Hayek stated that he was unhappy in his first marriage and as his wife would not grant him a divorce he had taken steps to obtain one unilaterally.For a time after his divorce, Hayek rarely visited his children, but kept up more regular contact with them in his older years after moving to Europe. Hayek's son, Laurence Hayek (1934\u20132004) was a distinguished microbiologist. His daughter Christine was an entomologist at the British Museum of Natural History, and she cared for him during his last years, when he had declining health.Hayek had a lifelong interest in biology and was also concerned with ecology and environmental protection. After being awarded his Nobel Prize, he offered his name to be used for endorsements by World Wildlife Fund, National Audubon Society, and the National Trust, a British conservationist organisation. Evolutionary biology was simply one of his interests in natural sciences. Hayek also had an interest in epistemology, which he often applied to his own thinking, as a social scientist. He held that methodological differences in the social sciences and in natural sciences were key to understanding why incompetent policies are often allowed.Hayek was brought up in a non-religious setting and decided from age 15 that he was an agnostic.He died in 1992 in Freiburg, Germany, where he had lived since leaving Chicago in 1961. Despite his advanced age by the 1980s, he continued to write, even purportedly finishing a book, The Fatal Conceit, in 1988, although its actual authorship is unclear."

        "content": "According to census documents, he was born in Victoria, Australia, the son of Robert Chapple Bryant. On his 1922 American naturalization documents, Esmelton's birth name was listed as Frederick Batty Green Bryant, and when he established residence in the United States, he sometimes used the name Frederick Esmelton Bryant. Sometime in the mid-1920s, he legally changed his name to Frederick Bryant Esmelton. While best known as a silent film actor, he also performed in numerous stage plays, especially on the west coast. For example, beginning in 1903, he led a troupe in Portland, Oregon, where he portrayed a number of roles for several years. But Esmelton was not just a stage actor: he was a frequent director of stage plays. In fact, when he worked for the Bijou Stock Company, one New Haven, Connecticut theater critic said he was \"one of the ablest stage directors ever known in the field of stock work.\" And Esmelton also served as the manager of an acting troupe based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Among the up-and-coming film stars who got their start working for him in Pittsburgh was Richard Dix. Esmelton frequently returned to his native Australia to perform in stage plays, some of which he produced.  And during the first World War, he was in a theater company sponsored by the Knights of Columbus that volunteered to go and entertain the troops in France.  While he was seldom cast in a starring role during his silent film career, he became known as a versatile supporting actor, for which he was often praised by critics.Esmelton was married several times. One of his wives was silent film actress Jewel Power (real name: Louise Power), with whom he had acted when both were in the Baker Stock Company in Portland, Oregon. After they divorced, he married Shakespearean actress Mary Hall, whose career he had managed while they worked in Pittsburgh.In addition to his acting career, in 1925, Esmelton was among the eight actors who founded the Masquers, a club where actors and directors could gather and fraternize. It remained in operation for more than six decades. [2] He helped to arrange its early events and was the club's first manager.  In his later years, in semi-retirement, Esmelton owned and operated a successful catering business in Hollywood, whose clients included some of the film studios where he had worked. He died in Los Angeles in October 1933, at the age of 61."

        "content": "Her modeling career started when Spanish fashion designer Elio Berhanyer asked both her and her twin sister Ana Maria Abascal to model some of his designs at the International Exhibition in New York in 1964. The couple caught Richard Avedon's eye and he decided to photograph them in Ibiza later in 1964 for his 'The Iberians (The Blaze in Spain)' editorial in Harper's Bazaar. By 1965 Abascal was on the cover of this publication in another photograph signed by Avedon. After this, her modeling career took off and she fixed her residence in New York.\nAmong others, she worked for Oscar de la Renta from his very early days -in fact they met while he was still working for Elizabeth Arden- and became great friends, a friendship that lasted until his death.\nDesigner Valentino met Abascal in 1968 at a party when she was 25 years old. By then, she had already been working as a model in New York for at least 3 years and had a full-time contract with Ford model agency; years later she would also be employed by Wilhelmina model agency. Valentino brought her to the island of Capri for modeling shoots and, ever since, they've remained close friends.\nIn 1971 Abascal married Murray Livingstone Smith, a vice-president of an advertising agency, although this has been disputed. They met at Cartier in NYC, and a few months later Smith sent a red Ferrari to her house with a note saying \"Marry me\". They did, but split up in 1975.\nIn 1971 she also had a short role within Woody Allen's 1971 film \"Bananas\" as the guerrilla girl Yolanda. This same year she posed nude for Playboy magazine and was also the cover of Andy Warhol's magazine \"Interview\".\nIn 1974 she made a 'commercial/happening' for Alka-Seltzer with Salvador Dal\u00ed which was seen as \"too aggressive\" by certain viewers. Dal\u00ed was shown pretending to stab Naty with some paint brushes, at the same time as he painted her body. The commercial was not particularly successful and was taken back from public view quite quickly.\nTowards the end of 1975 she returned to her home in Seville (Spain). She reunited with an ex-boyfriend from her teenage years, Rafael Medina y Fernandez de Cordoba, Duke of Feria and Marquis of Villalba and they married in July 1977 and had two sons: Rafael, born on 25 September 1978, who is the present Duke of Feria, and Luis, born on 30 August 1980.\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, and well after having left the fashion world, she jumped again on the catwalks for her friend Carolina Herrera's first collection. It would be her last catwalk show. In 1982, several years after having left the fashion world, Norman Parkinson decided to portray her in the Caribbean for Town and Country magazine. In 1984 she presented Oscar de la Renta's collection to the Spanish media and in 1987 Lord Snowdon also photographed her in Seville. Naty and Rafael Medina split up in 1989 and divorced on unfriendly terms.\nAbascal is known as one of Valentino Garavani's Spanish muses and she's also closely connected to Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera, among other designers. She still works regularly as a stylist for Hola! magazine as well as many other punctual projects."

In November 1945, he served as Prime Minister for a short period of time. After the war he became Minister for Reconstruction under Georgios Papandreou in a national unity government.

He was placed under house arrest for the next seven years. During the events leading to the metapolitefsi (the period of political transition following the fall of the military junta), Phaedon Gizikis actively considered giving Kanellopoulos the mandate to form a transitional government. After the metapolitefsi Kanellopoulos resumed his parliamentary career as a member of the New Democracy party. He declined offers to become President of Greece when the post was offered to him during the metapolitefsi.\nKanellopoulos was the nephew of Dimitrios Gounaris.\n\n\n== References =="

Specifically, lin-4 was responsible for the progressive repression of the protein LIN-14 during larval development of the worm; mutant worms deficient in lin-4 function had persistently high levels of LIN-14 and displayed developmental timing defects. However, the mechanism for control of LIN-14 remained unknown.\nAmbros and colleagues found that lin-4, unexpectedly, did not encode a regulatory protein. Instead, it gave rise to some small RNA molecules, 22 and 61 nucleotides in length, which Ambros called lin-4S (short) and lin-4L (long). Sequence analysis showed that lin-4S was part of lin-4L: lin-4L was predicted to form a stem-loop structure, with lin-4S contained in one of the arms, the 5' arm. Furthermore, Ambros, together with Gary Ruvkun (Harvard), discovered that lin-4S was partially complementary to several sequences in the 3' untranslated region of the messenger RNA encoding the LIN-14 protein. Ambros and colleagues hypothesized that lin-4 could regulate LIN-14 through binding of lin-4S to these sequences in the lin-14 transcript in a type of antisense RNA mechanism.\nIn 2000, another C. elegans small RNA regulatory molecule, let-7, was characterized by the Ruvkun lab  and found to be conserved in many species, including vertebrates. These discoveries confirmed that Ambros had in fact discovered a class of small RNAs with conserved functions. These molecules are now known as microRNA. Ambros was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 2007. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011."

He studied piano and music composition under Georges Mathias at the Conservatoire de Paris and musical harmony and composition under Antoine Taudou and Louis de Serres, who had trained with C\u00e9sar Franck.

In 1892, he returned briefly to New York where he taught piano for a year but, as he could not take the weather there due to health reasons, he returned to Ponce in 1893. While in Ponce he arranged successful musical presentations of his students to the public. In 1904, he submitted a group of his musical compositions for piano and orchestra to the Universal Exposition that was being held that year in St. Louis, Missouri, from 30 April through 1 December, and these were awarded a gold medal. In 1914, Chavier organized a far-reaching Musical Competition that was sponsored by the Liga Progresista de Ponce and held in that city that same year.As a musician and music instructor, Chavier was admired by all as his technique was coherent and contained integrity.  As a composer he created a vast library of compositions, mostly for piano and for string instruments. Unfortunately, most of his compositions were presented only in Ponce and were not internationalized. As a music critic and musicologist, Ar\u00edstides Chavier published his essays in Puerto Rican papers of the times, and thanks to his fluency in French and English he translated many music writings from foreign publications into Spanish for the local public. While he did not dislike the then popular danza, he felt it should not be the only musical expression of the people and thus most of his musical productions were of a classical and modernistic nature. He created compositions for piano with two and four hands versions, for military ensembles, for orchestras and for string instruments."

Military policemen, whilst looking for deserters, had burst into the hotel room of Haxton and Lindsell to find them committing a homosexual act that was not buggery.

Haxton was a prisoner aboard the Wolf until February 1918 when the Wolf returned to Germany and he was transferred to a German prison camp. He was reunited with Maugham in 1919.On attempting to return in February 1919 he was deported from Britain as an undesirable alien and was never allowed to enter the country again. Haxton's Home Office file, containing the reason or reasons for his banishment, was sealed until 2019. Robert Calder speculates that Syrie Maugham may have used her high connections in the British government to have Haxton deported.Because Maugham and Haxton traveled abroad and chose to live on the French Riviera in the \"Villa La Mauresque\", they were able to carry on their relationship despite Haxton's deportation. They lived in Villa Mauresque at Cap Ferrat almost exclusively until they were forced to flee the advancing Germans at the commencement of World War II.\nIt is thought that Haxton's flamboyant nature, said to be portrayed in the character Rowley Flint in Up at the Villa, was the key to Maugham's popularity with the members of society wherever the pair traveled."

Then came Los Ultimos Heroes, which was released in Portuguese as Os Ultimos Herois, and No Me Corten El Pelo.\nAlmost immediately after becoming a former Menudo in 1991, Robert and ex-bandmate and friend Rawy Torres formed a group named Euphoria during the early 1990s and recorded two albums; Euphoria and Toma Mi Coraz\u00f3n.\nIn 1994 Avellanet went to college at the University of Puerto Rico to study advertising.  In 1996 tropical music producer and business executive, Ralph Mercado, signed Robert to record a salsa album under the RMM label with the distribution of Universal Music.  The album Sentir (1999), produced by Isidro Infante, had success in several Latin American countries, and in New York and Puerto Rico.  The album was promoted by its lead single, \"Miente\", a cover of Enrique Iglesias's song which became a top-ten hit on the Billboard Tropical Airplay chart.In 2002 Robert moved to Miami to pursue new challenges as an artist.  He became a well known soap opera actor working for networks such as Univision, Telemundo and Venevision Productions. Avellanet has also been in several theatrical plays, such as Qui\u00e9n Mato a Hector Lavoe, The Sleeping Beauty, Cuatro XXXX and Descarados.\nIn 2003 Avellanet and his former Menudo bandmates (Sergio, Ruben, Angelo and Rawy) made a reunion tour, naming it Los Ultimos Heroes.

Jet Privado includes collaborations from Venezuelan producer and songwriter Frank Santofimio, Colombian producer/engineer Andres Saavedra and Venezuelan songwriter/producer Juan Carlos Perez Soto.\nJet Privado was released digitally around the globe on January 20, 2009.\nIn 2011 Robert moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a career in acting and throughout the next decade he worked in several TV series, films and commercials, and also released several music singles.In 2014 he released his first album in English, Heart and Soul, 10 songs with influences of soul, jazz and pop rock.  It was produced by Fernando Perdomo and co-produced by Robert himself.  It features songs like When I Have You, Love Is A Journey and Shine Your Light.During 2015, Avellanet joined fellow former Menudo members Miguel Cancel, Ray Reyes, Rene Farrait and Charlie Masso in a tour throughout Latin America and United States, once again using the name Menudo.  Right after this, he also participated in the Menudomania Forever tour, where Menudo's 40th anniversary was celebrated by bringing together a large number of former members. They performed in Miami, Florida, and in several cities of Mexico.\nRobert's latest feature film Free Dead Or Alive, streamed on Prime Video on August 8, 2022.

He had two marriages each lasting about 30 years, first to Lorraine Faxon Meisner and subsequently to Lynn Lubkeman. He had three children from the first marriage and one child from the second.

But by the time he reached adulthood during the post-war boom, Detroit was a thriving center of culture as well as the auto industry. He remained in Detroit, enrolling at Wayne State University. An outstanding student, Meisner was admitted to a graduate program there after only two years of college.\nHowever this was also the beginning of the Cold War and the Red Scare in the U.S., having serious repercussions on the personal lives of Maurice Meisner and his  wife Lorraine. As part of the McCarthy era investigations, Lorraine was subpoenaed before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1952 in relation to her attendance at the World Festival of Youth and Students held in East Berlin the previous year. Like most witnesses called before hearings of HUAC or the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS), Lorraine Meisner refused to testify to the body. Although this assertion of her Fifth Amendment rights had no direct legal consequences, David Henry, president of Wayne State University where she was also a student, saw fit to expel her from the university. Although seen as an unusually harsh move even at the time, other schools were reluctant to admit a student dismissed under such circumstances.\nThe Meisners moved to Chicago after they had been accepted to study at the University of Chicago, where they both would eventually receive doctorates. Maurice Meisner undertook to study Chinese history at a time when this would be considered an obscure choice, but where the emerging significance of China might be discerned in the wake of the 1949 revolution and role of China in the Korean War. This included studying the Chinese language to do research and travel in order to collaborate with the rather few China scholars of the time.\nMeisner's doctoral dissertation was prepared under the Sovietologist Leonard Haimson and developed in further year of research at the East Asian Research Center at Harvard. It was later published by Harvard University Press. In it, Meisner studied the original contributions to Chinese revolutionary theory by the co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party, Li Dazhao to show that the adaptation of Marxism to China which had been attributed to Mao Zedong had actually been accomplished by Li.Maurice Meisner was an early member of the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars (CCAS). In addition to opposing American participation in the Vietnam War, the group also involved itself in demystifying China at a time in which \"Red China\" was regularly portrayed as a threat to America, arguably surpassing the Soviet Union as a target of anti-communist sentiment toward the end of the 1960s. Meisner wrote for their publication, the Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars, and at the time of his death in 2012 he was still listed on the advisory board of the journal.Beginning with an article in the 1963 The China Quarterly, he published articles in the leading journals in the field, including Asian Survey, Current History, Journal of Asian Studies, and Modern China, among others."

Francis junior was educated at the Roman Catholic College at Ware, Hertfordshire, and was trained in medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London.He set up a private anatomy class in Charterhouse Square, but, in the words of the British Medical Journal, his \"great success as a teacher caused much jealousy, and, in 1825, gave rise to the Council of the College of Surgeons passing a resolution refusing to receive certificates from any but recognised teachers.\" Kiernan's class size dwindled as students departed. Appeals to the Council to rescind its decision, on the grounds of Kiernan's ability and skill as a teacher, were dismissed.He became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1825.

In his obituary, Alan Blyth described Legay's voice as \"light yet penetrating timbre, its flexible, liquid character\" and that he used it \"with fastidious taste\" and displayed \"keenness of word-painting allied to the inflections of the music\".Along with such mid-twentieth century tenors as Alain Vanzo and L\u00e9opold Simoneau, Legay represented a lost style of French operatic singing."

His story is related in the anonymous 6th-century Georgian hagiographic novel The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta.\nOne of the earliest extant works of the Georgian literature, The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta (\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10e2\u10f3\u10da\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0\u10f2 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10db\u10dd\u10d7\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0\u10f2 \u10ec\u10db\u10d8\u10d3\u10d8\u10e1\u10d0 \u10d4\u10d5\u10e1\u10e2\u10d0\u10d7\u10d8 \u10db\u10ea\u10ee\u10d4\u10d7\u10d4\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d0\u10f2) was written by an anonymous author later in the 6th century, within thirty years of Eustathius' reported death. The morphology of the work as well as some theological phrases also supports this dating, although the earliest surviving manuscript dates from c. 1000 (Georgian National Center of Manuscripts, MSS H-341). The text is also interesting for the first Georgian formulation of the Ten Commandments, an account of the life of Jesus which recalls Tatian's Diatessaron (a Gospel harmony of the 2nd century), and traces of influence of the 2nd century Apology of Aristides. The Passion was first published by Mikhail Sabinin in 1882.Eustathius is reported by the hagiographer to have been an Iranian cobbler originally called Gvirobandak, son of a high-ranking Zoroastrian priest (magi), from Ganzak. Having converted to Christianity, he flees persecution to Georgia (Iberia), then under the Iranian military authority, in 541. He settles at the Christian town of Mtskheta and marries a Christian woman. The local Iranian cobblers\u2019 guild denounces Eustathius to the marzban Arvand Gushnasp with seven other converts to be judged. Arvand punishes the apostates by having their noses pierced and casts them in prison under sentence of death. Six months later, Arvand releases them, however, as a farewell gesture to the local people, when recalled from Georgia by the king Khosrau I. Four years later, under the new marzban Vezhan Buzmihr, Eustathius is rearrested, but reaffirms his faith before the court in a speech of some 3,000 words that makes up nearly half the Passion. Eventually, the marzban, albeit reluctant, has him beheaded in Tbilisi. The remains of Eustathius were taken to Mtskheta and buried at its principal church."

After an economic downturn hit England in the mid 1820s, Edward's eldest brother James Henty thought that better opportunities for the family existed in Australia. In 1829 James travelled to the Swan River Colony with two other brothers, Stephen and John. Edward remained in Sussex, studying and assisting his father with his business interests there."

        "content": "It was difficult to find suitable land in Tasmania and Edward was sent to explore the coast of the mainland. He reported that the district near Portland Bay had good possibilities, and after revisiting it with his father, it was decided that the land was suitable for settlement. Edward went first on the Thistle with labourers, stock, potatoes and seed. After a voyage of 34 days the Thistle arrived at Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 at 8 a.m. Edward Henty told the anecdote,\n\"I stuck a plough into the ground, struck a she-oak root, and broke the point ; cleaned my gun, shot a kangaroo, mended the bellows, blew the forge fire, straightened the plough, and turned the first sod in Victoria\"\nThe second vessel brought Mr. Francis Henty, who landed on 11 December and in course of time Mr. Stephen and Mr. Thomas followed. Sheep were fetched across from Tasmania, pastures occupied, houses erected and land cultivated. The Henty brothers also engaged on bay whaling at Portland in the 1830s. The whale oil and baleen taken from southern right whales was shipped to Tasmania for export to London.\nThe British government had been keen to have land taken up in Western Australia and the Hentys had assumed no objections would be raised to their obtaining land in the Port Phillip district. The application was first made in 1834 and negotiations continued for many years. The father, Thomas Henty, died in 1839, and it was not until 1846 that the matter was finally settled, when the Hentys were allowed \u00a3348 for improvements at the port, and were granted 155 acres (0.63 km2) of land valued at \u00a31290. The remainder of their land they had to buy at auction. The attitude of the government at Sydney to new settlers may be illustrated by an extract from a dispatch of the governor, Sir George Gipps, to Lord John Russell, dated 11 April 1840. \"The Messrs Henty, like the first settlers at Port Phillip, claim to have rendered good service to the government and to the colony of New South Wales by opening a district of country, which might otherwise have remained unoccupied for a number of years; but, so far from considering this any advantage, I look upon it as directly the reverse, not only because the dispersion of our population is increased by it, but because also we are forced prematurely to incur considerable expense in the formation of new establishments. I have already, in consequence of the proceedings of the Messrs Henty, been obliged to send two expeditions to Portland Bay, and I am now under the necessity of organizing a police force there, and of laying out a town, besides incurring expense for the protection of the aborigines.\" The thought that the many thousands of pounds spent by the Hentys in developing the country might eventually be of benefit to the state had apparently not entered into the minds of the authorities. Neither could they have anticipated that the first sale of crown lands which took place a few months later would yield the sum of \u00a317,245.\nEdward Henty was determined to continue with his settlement; his brother, Francis, had joined him in December 1834, and during the next five years other members of the family joined him, and gradually all of their horses, cattle and sheep were transferred from Tasmania. On 29 August 1836 the exploring party headed by Major Thomas Livingstone Mitchell reached Portland Bay and were amazed to find the country already colonised. In later years Edward Henty was fond of telling the story of Major Mitchell when he came to a hut, from which blows of a hammer rang, saying, \"Where is Mr Henty, my man,\" and the reply of the burly blacksmith, \"Here he is at your service.\" From Major Mitchell Henty learned the character of the land to the north, and gradually he was able to acquire more land. In 1845 he had over 70,000 acres (280 km\u00b2). Sometimes the price of wool and sheep fell very low and it was impossible to sell either to advantage; but over the years the stations prospered.\nIn 1855 Edward Henty was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Normanby and was re-elected in 1859. He was defeated in 1861 and did not sit again in parliament. Henty's last years were spent in retirement at his Melbourne mansion 'Offington' and he died on 14 August 1878. In October 1840 he married Annie Maria Gallie who survived him. They had no children.\nEdward Henty in addition to being the first permanent settler in Victoria was the founder of the wool industry in that colony. His portrait is in the historical collection at the Melbourne public library."

        "content": "Rottmann was born in Handschuhsheim (today a part of Heidelberg) on 11 January 1797. There he received his first drawing lessons from his father, Friedrich Rottmann, who taught drawing at the university in Heidelberg. He formed himself chiefly through the study of nature and of great masterworks. In his first artistic period, he painted atmospheric phenomena. After gaining prominence with Heidelberg at Sunset (a water color), and Castle Eltz, he settled in Munich in 1822 and devoted himself to Bavarian scenery. Here his second period began, and in 1824 he married Friedericke, the daughter of his uncle, Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell, who served as an attendant at court.\nThrough this connection, he made the acquaintance of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who in 1826/27 sponsored his travels in Italy in order to widen his repertoire, which up to that point consisted solely of domestic, German, landscapes. In Italy, Rottmann made sketches for the 28 Italian landscapes in fresco which he was commissioned to paint in the arcades of the Hofgarten at Munich. The cycle, completed in 1833, gave visual expression to Ludwig's alliance with Italy, and raised the genre of landscape painting to the height of history painting, the preferred mode of the King's other great commissions for monumental painting. The frescos unfortunately deteriorated under climatic influences. The cartoons for them are in the Darmstadt Gallery.\nIn 1834 Rottmann traveled to Greece to prepare for a commission from Ludwig for a second cycle; one might mark here the beginning of his third period. At first also intended for the Hofgarten arcade, the 23 great landscapes were eventually installed in the newly built Neue Pinakothek where they were given their own hall.\nOf his easel pictures, Ammer Lake and Marathon are in the National Gallery, Berlin; The Acropolis of Sikyon and Corfu in the Pinakothek, Munich; others in the Schack Gallery, Munich, and in Karlsruhe; and seven in the Leipzig Museum.\nCarl Rottmann died on 7 July 1850 in Munich, aged 53 of undisclosed causes. He is buried in the Alter S\u00fcdfriedhof in Munich."

He is the Interim Executive Director of the Cultural Space Agency, having most recently served for 9 years as the Cultural Space Liaison for the City of Seattle. He is also well known as the founder of Consolidated Works, a contemporary arts center in Seattle.\nRichter has been producing alternative contemporary art, performance, film and music since his graduation from Northwestern University in 1990. In 1992, he formed the seminal Rm 608, a gallery for visual and performing arts, in an abandoned storefront on Seattle's Capitol Hill. The \"small but influential\" (The Stranger) organization served as the launching point for local talents such as David Schmader, the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players, Kia Sian, and Kristen Kosmas, and over the course of its two-year lifespan presented over 200 world-premiere works of theater and performance art, several of which received continued runs off-Broadway in New York City. On its closing in 1994 (the organization's lifespan was built into its structure, and the closing was anticipated) Richter was quoted in The Seattle Weekly as saying, \"Organizations should end, in the same way that performances end, so that the audience can clap, go home, and think about what it meant.\"\nIn 1994, he was hired as the Theater Editor of The Stranger, the alternative newsweekly in Seattle. While there, he expanded his interest in writing and published investigative journalism (according to the paper's website, one undercover report earned him personal bodyguard protection following death threats made by the group investigated) and feature-length articles that were reprinted in alternative newsweeklies around the country. He was also published in an American Heritage college geography textbook.  He left the newspaper in 1997 but continues to publish sporadically, most recently writing on the issue of nonprofit reform in America.\nIn 1998, he formed Consolidated Works, a contemporary arts center in Seattle, housed in a renovated 32,000-square-foot (3,000 m2) warehouse in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood. Art in America called ConWorks (as it was known for short) \"the most dazzling\" alternative arts space in the Northwest. Over the course of seven years as its executive director, he grew the organization into one of the region's most prestigious arts presenters, working with teams of curators and producers to fill the facility's theater, cinema, visual art gallery, music hall, lecture stage, and bar. The center flourished, reportedly thanks to Richter's \"legendary fundraising skills\" and \"internationally renowned programming\" (Seattle Post-Intelligencer).\nIn 2002 he was one of twelve individuals invited under the auspices of the Rockefeller Foundation to contribute as founding members of the National Arts and Technology Network. In 2003 he received the Seattle Mayor's Arts Award on behalf of ConWorks, and also in 2003 was one of 12 recipients nationally of the Safeco Insurance Rudy Award for leadership in the nonprofit sector. A profile of the Seattle arts scene in Art in America referred to Richter as \"an arts visionary.\" A profile in The Stranger referred to him as \"freakishly ambitious.\""

Despite the DJ John Peel being a fan of their music, they never released any material, recording only an unreleased single at Open Eye Studios, in Liverpool and playing a few gigs in the North-West, most notably supporting Cabaret Voltaire at Nathan McGough's Plato's Ballroom in 1981, before disbanding the same year.\nNoko was hired by The Cure as bassist, for a one-off concert in Germany at Alabamahalle, Munich, filmed for television on 30.01.1984 and a live promotional 2-song TV appearance on BBC Oxford Road Show 24.02.1984. In addition he also recorded a 4-song radio session with the band on 02.02.1984 at BBC Maida Vale Studios for David Jensen, which was broadcast on 22.02.1984. He also formed two bands, Dynamo Futurista and The Umbrella. The latter group, consisting of Noko (guitar and vocals), Simon Hoare (drums), Mark Sanderson (bass) and James Gardner, released a total of three songs before folding, which were released on an EP called Make Hell (For The Beautiful People).\nFounder Buzzcock and Magazine frontman, Howard Devoto, started writing with Noko in 1986 with a view to putting a band together to play Factory Records' Festival of the Tenth Summer at the G-Mex arena in Manchester that summer to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Punk. They played a short set as Adultery, borrowing backline from the Smiths. (Noko also played a set with Pete Shelley at the same gig in a line-up that also included ex-Magazine drummer John Doyle).\nThe line-up for that Adultery show was: Howard Devoto \u2013 vocals, Noko \u2013 lead guitar/viola, Leroy James \u2013 keyboards/2nd guitar, Pete Kinski \u2013 bass, Simon Hoare \u2013 drums. Signing to Beggars Banquet in 1987 and deciding on the name Luxuria, Devoto and Noko released two LPs: Unanswerable Lust (1988) and Beastbox (1990) and toured Europe and USA throughout 1988 with a line-up of Devoto and Noko on vocals/guitars and viola as usual and Karl Leiker \u2013 bass, Mark Rowlett \u2013 Drums/Sequential Studio 440, James Gardner \u2013 keyboards, programming, Frog \u2013 guitar/keyboards. The final Luxuria gig at The Town & Country Club (now the London Forum) in London featured cameo appearances by Barry Adamson (bass) on a rendition of Magazine's \"The Light Pours Out of Me\" for an encore, and Morrissey, who read a passage of Marcel Proust's \"A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu\" over the intro of \"Mademoiselle\" before throwing the tattered book into the crowd as the band kicked into the song. (There is a bootleg recording of the gig in circulation).\nWhen Luxuria folded in 1990, Noko got together with school friends, brothers Trevor Gray and Howard Gray, and James Gardner and formed Apollo 440.\nThe band released a number of singles and EPs on their own StealthSonic Recordings label: \"Lolita\" (1990), \"Destiny\" (1991), \"Blackout\" (1992) and \"Lolita/Destiny '92\" (1992).\nApollo 440 made four albums: Millennium Fever (1995), ElectroGlide In Blue (1997), Gettin' High On Your Own Supply (1999), and Dude Descending A Staircase (2003) on Sony Records. The band have been playing live in one form or another since their inception in 1990 to the present day and chronologically the touring line-ups are as follows:\n1990\u20131992: The band featured all founding members on keyboards, sequencers and drum machines and MCs Stevie Hyper-D and Tigga-Max guesting from time to time on vocals.\n1993\u20131995: James Gardner left for New Zealand where he has since established himself as a prominent composer writing music for his ensemble 175 East. Noko moved over to electric guitar and lead vocals, Trevor Gray on keyboards, Howard Gray on bass, and ex-Modern Eon drummer Cliff Hewitt was added to the line-up first on electronic, then onto acoustic drums. (Kenny Cougar briefly replaced Rej on bass during 1999).\n1996\u20132000: Noko \u2013 guitar, Trevor Gray \u2013 keyboards, Howard Gray \u2013 vibe controller/live-mix, Cliff Hewitt \u2013 drums, Paul Kodish \u2013 drums, Reinallt Ap Gwynnedd \u2013 bass, Mary Byker (ex-Gaye Bykers on Acid) \u2013 lead vocals, Harry-K \u2013 DJ/vocals.

Cliff Hewitt \u2013 drums, Reinallt Ap Gwynnedd \u2013 bass, Ewan MacFarlane \u2013 lead vocals, Ashley Krajewski \u2013 MPC/keyboards.\n2008\u2013present: Chuck Sabo briefly replaced Cliff Hewitt on drums in 2008 (and again in 2009) as Cliff had touring commitments with German artist Schiller; Steve Barney did the same in early 2010 and Mikey Cusick (who had previously played with Noko in Maximum Roach from 2004 to 2005) replaced Rej on bass in 2008 and remains the current Apollo 440 bassman.\nThe 2010 Apollo 440 touring line-up: Noko \u2013 guitar, Trevor Gray \u2013 keyboards, Howard Gray \u2013 vibe controller/live-mix. Cliff Hewitt \u2013 drums, Mikey Cusick \u2013 bass/vocals, Ewan MacFarlane \u2013 lead vocals, Ashley Krajewski \u2013 MPC/keyboards/vocals.\n2004 saw Noko in a two-man band with James Maker. The band released only one EP via Morrissey's Attack imprint (I'm Unbearable/Born That Way) and the two musicians parted early 2005 after touring with a full band line-up on Morrissey's European and UK dates including his Meltdown festival appearance at the Royal Festival Hall supporting the newly reformed New York Dolls. That line-up included Paul Kodish on drums, Simeon Bowring on bass, and Ashley Krajewski on keyboards.\nIn November 2008, Noko was announced as the guitarist of the reformed Magazine, joining his former collaborators Howard Devoto, Barry Adamson, John Doyle and Dave Formula.In summer 2009, Magazine played \"The Soap Show: Episode 2009\" at the Royal Festival Hall. It was shown in two halves, the first of which was The Correct Use Of Soap LP in its original running order followed by the B-sides and the song \"Upside Down\" which had never been performed live before. They also played selected European festivals with a set culled from the \"Real Life & Thereafter\" tour.\nThe band rounded off the year's activities with appearances on BBC TV's Later... with Jools Holland and the BBC Electric Proms.\nMagazine have released a brand new live DVD and CD, Real Life & Thereafter: Live at Manchester Academy 17.02.09.\n2009 also saw the completion and release of Noko's first full movie score. Une Affaire D'etat, a French-language political thriller based on best-selling novel Nos Fantastiques Ann\u00e9es Fric by Dominique Manotti was directed by \u00c9ric Valette and stars Andr\u00e9 Dussollier, Thierry Fr\u00e9mont and Rachida Brakni. European cinema release was in October of that year. A soundtrack CD is available on Milan Musique.\n2010 also saw the formation of Raw Chimp with Noko (guitar/vocals), his wife Deborah Fisher-Jones (bass), and Constance Kaler (lead vocals). Raw Chimp played their live debut that same year at the Download Festival.\nNoko also scored  \u00c9ric Valette's next movie, The Prey which was released in France in April 2011 with worldwide distribution to follow later in 2012. Another French-language thriller, it was written by Laurent Turner and the movie's producer Luc Bossi, The Prey stars Albert Dupontel, Alice Taglioni, St\u00e9phane Debac and Sergi Lopez.\nIt's a dark high-octane edgy chase movie starting in a prison and culminating in a tense mountain denouement. The score is essential orchestral with touches of electronica and a multitude of Noko's trademark guitar-textures.\nThe soundtrack CD is again available on Milan Musique.\nMagazine completed their No Thyself LP at the end of 2011, the first new material from the band since 1981's Magic, Murder and the Weather, which was released on the Wire-Sound label. The band toured the UK in November. The LP and tour and BBC radio session were the first to feature new bass-player Stan White who replaced Barry Adamson.\nApollo 440's fifth LP The Future's What It Used to Be was released at the beginning of 2012 and the group continue to play live.\nIn 2012, Noko stepped in on bass guitar and backing vocals with London neo-grunge trio Levyathan, alongside Simon Maxwell on drums and David Norris on guitar and lead vocals. The band recorded a Noko-produced debut LP later that year at Apollo Control but it was never released.\nIn February 2013, Noko and Brad Lee from Discoordinated performed at Matthew Glamorre's multi-media series of art-happenings, C.R.U.X. at Zero-One Gallery in Hopkins St. Soho, London W1.\nThey revisited their 2-man version of Roxy Music's classic, \"In Every Dream Home a Heartache\", last performed in 2007.\nIn March 2013, Noko composed and performed his one-man live music score on electric guitar to Theatre Of Post Eroticism's production of BDSM Faust : an adaption of Johann Wolfgang Goethe's 1808 \"Faust\" (Part 1). There was another UK run of the production in June and the show was performed in Romania later in the year.\nIn 2014, Noko co-wrote/ co-produced some tracks for Japanese guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei's LP New Beginnings (released in Japan Virgin/Universal TYCT-60046).\nThese were \"Sons Of Sorrow\", \"New Chemical\" and \"Barrel Of My Own Gun\". Noko played bass guitar on \"Sons Of Sorrow\" and \"Barrel Of My Own Gun\" and vocals on \"Barrel of my own Gun\" and \"New Chemical\".\nWhen Hotei later signed to Universal's Spinefarm imprint, this LP was repackaged with some extra tracks for release outside of Japan as Strangers (SPINE663762) and included a re-worked version of \"New Chemical\" titled \"Move It\", featuring a lead vocal by Richard Z. Kruspe from Rammstein.\nIt was at Noko's suggestion that Hotei approached Iggy Pop to sing two other tracks on the album, which became \"How The Cookie Crumbles\" and \"Walking Through The Night\".\nHotei and Noko have been friends since 1997, first meeting when Apollo 440 remixed one of Hotei's tracks. They share a birthday, having both been born on exactly the same day, 1 February 1962.\nSince 2014 Noko has periodically toured with Hotei in Europe, U.S. and Japan, playing bass guitar in various line-ups, including drummers Steve Barney, Cliff Hewitt and Zachary Alford.\nLater in 2014, Noko produced and mixed Pop Will Eat Itself's \"Reclaim The Game (Funk FIFA)\" unofficial Brazil World Cup 2014 theme featuring Brazilian rap artist BNeg\u00e3o.\nNoko went on to produce and mix some tracks for the band's 2015 Anti-Nasty League album (RUMJOINT0005): \"Sacrifice And Pain\", \"Director's Cut\" and \"Mental Pollution\" (to which he had a writing contribution), playing additional guitar, bass and various keyboard/programming enhancements along the way.\nThis led to the band he formed with Brad Lee, $HirtLiftA supporting PWEI on their UK tour that summer: Brad Lee on vocals, Noko on guitar and Frank Horovich on guitar and electronics.\nIn 2016, Noko reunited with Matthew Glamorre to form SCISM, the 'house-band' at his SCISM audio-visual, multi-media art-happening nightclub on EU Referendum night in London.\nThey recorded and released \"Dalston Bump\" to coincide with a series of events at Vogue Fabrics in Dalston.\nIn Summer 2017 SCISM played a set at Churchtown festival in Cornwall and again in September at The Bargehouse in London as part of Open London weekend.\nIn April 2017, Magazine released the vinyl-only \"Old World Charm\" (WIRED42) : 6 tracks recorded at the BBC Electric Proms at Roundhouse, London in 2009. The Graeme Oxby pic on the rear of the sleeve featured Noko's MXR 'flanger-on-a-stick'.\nNoko composed and produced the music score for director Darren Cavanagh's feature-length documentary Ex-Dominatrix, for release in December 2017.\nThe movie opened the 2019 London Fetish Film Festival, at which it won Best Feature.\nIn 2017, Noko and Mary Byker started work recording a body of songs that would become the debut Am I Dead Yet? album, which was released on the Wire-Sound label in April 2019 (WIRED#48). A 5-track remix EP, \u201cNever Mind The Bolex\u2026Am I Dead Yet? reimagined on 35mm\u201d(WIRED#49), which featured cinematic dub remixes of some of the album highlights, was released as a download only, free with advance-orders of the album during the crowd-fun run-up to the actual release. Live dates promoting the album saw the live line-up expanded with the addition of Cliff Hewitt from Apollo 440 on drums and Derek \u2018Hoodlum Priest\u2019 Thompson on bass guitar."

A further track \"StealthSonic Sun In Her Hair\" appeared on a Limbo compilation the following year.\nThe EZ Drum & Bass Orchestra consisted of Noko and Frederick Pasquan and made one commercially available EP \"Beat Girl\" b/w \"EZ Beat Girl\" and \"Slow Beat Girl\" on the Sliced label in 1996.\nThe duo also remixed a number of other artists e.g. \"Carrerra Rapida -EZ Drum&Bass Orchestra Remix\" by Apollo 440 on Sony in 1997.\nNoko played bass in 1991 on the Total Abandon EP and Jubilee Twist LP in 1992  by The Heart Throbs, a group from Reading who folded in 1993.\nNoko played a number of gigs with the band in 1991 and was in the line up that was joined onstage on 25 October of that year by Only Ones frontman, Peter Perrett at Underworld, Camden Town,London, for a version of The Only Ones' \"Lovers Of Today\" along with a few other songs.\nIn the same year, he played abstract guitar on the song \"Ventriloquists and Dolls\" from Momus's album Hippopotamomus.\nIn 1992, Noko produced the one and only LP by Hyperhead, Metaphasia, which came out on the Devotion label. The band was formed by Mary Byker. \nAfter Gaye Bykers on Acid split, Mary joined and toured with industrial supergroup Pigface before forming Hyperhead, which included contributions from his Pigface colleagues Martin Atkins (also formerly of PiL and Killing Joke) and William Tucker (also previously of Revolting Cocks and My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult), along with bassist Karl Leiker (who had previously played with Noko in Luxuria) and guitarist Paul Dalloway.\nAlso in 1992, Noko collaborated with Stuart Crichton as Johnny Potatohead, releasing a single, \"Johnny Potatohead\" on Reverb Records.\nOn 14 July 1998, Apollo 440 played \"La Nuit Electronique\" concert with Jean Michel Jarre, with whom they had collaborated twice that year : firstly on the single \"Rendezvous '98\"  (which became the ITV World Cup Theme in UK and reached #10 in the singles chart) and an @440 remix of \"Oxygene 10\". Apollo performed the two tracks live onstage with JMJ in front of the Eiffel Tower to an audience of over 600,000. It was Bastille Day and only two days before, France had won the World Cup. Immediately after they won on 12th, the Mayor of Paris asked Jarre to put together this impromptu free concert for the people of Paris to extend the euphoria. At the climax of the show, an enormous firework display went off on the Eiffel tower behind the stage.\nThis was the largest concert Noko has ever played. Noko and both Gray brothers all played synthesiser and Jean Michel Jarre played theremin.\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Noko was involved as Producer/Musical Director for The Prada Meinhof Gang, an all-female Art-Terrorist troupe active between 2002 and 2004, whose activities included performance/installations at the Venice Biennalle, Tate Britain, ICA etc. Their track \"Want Is Your Master\" was included on the free CD compilation that accompanied the \"Music\" issue of Modern Painters magazine.\nIn March 2007, Apollo 440 played the \"A Tribute To Billy MacKenzie\" charity concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire alongside British Electric Foundation (their first ever live show),Glenn Gregory (Heaven 17), Claudia Br\u00fccken (Propaganda) and Paul Humphries (OMD) and Paul Haig, amongst others. It was 10 years after his death.\nApollo, with Ewan MacFarlane on vocals closed the show with \"Pain In Any Language\" from their 2nd LP Electroglide In Blue.\nThis collaboration was the last song MacKenzie finished before his tragic suicide only weeks later. \nThe Apollo set also included their cover of The Smiths' \"William, it was really nothing\" - the only time it was ever performed live.\nNoko made his feature-film debut with a brief cameo appearance as an accordion-playing Parisian street musician in \u00c9ric Valette's Une Affaire D'Etat movie in 2009.\nHe also had a cameo in \u00c9ric Valette's next movie La Proie in 2011 as a harpsichord player in a music-recital scene set in a prison which culminates in a full-scale riot.\nIn 2011, Noko contributed guitar to two tracks on The Organ Of Corti, an LP by Magazine's Dave Formula and cellist Christine Hanson.\nAfter the passing of Pete Shelley in December 2018, Noko was asked to perform with the current Buzzcocks, Steve Diggle, Danny Farrant and Chris Remington, at a special memorial concert at London's Royal Albert Hall on 21 June. The concert featured original Buzzcocks drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey alongside a number of special guests, including Pauline Murray (Penetration), Captain Sensible (The Damned), Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth), Peter Perrett (The Only Ones), Richard Jobson (Skids), Dave Vanian (The Damned) and Tim Burgess (The Charlatans).\nNoko played Pete Shelley's guitar parts and solos for the duration of the show, which was MC'd by Paul Morley and included tributes by original Buzzcocks manager and New Hormones label founder Richard Boon, original Buzzcock  Howard Devoto, who provided a short film featuring a world premiere of a Buzzkunst track that he'd recorded with Pete, but was never released and, to end the show, a eulogy and special thanks from Pete's wife Greta.\nAppropriately, Noko played two songs, \"Boredom\" and \"Time's Up\" on a red 1960s Starway guitar - the same model made famous by Pete during the early Spiral Scratch days of the band, with its missing top-section."

In 1992, he studied at Musician's Institute in Los Angeles with Scott Henderson, Frank Gambale, and MI founder Paul Hanson, also playing studio and live gigs.\nIn 2000, Demir released his eponymous initial solo album with Sony Music. His albums Dunya Benim (The World is Mine) and 2004 Istanbul followed in 2002 and 2004.

One of the more remarkable works of Demirkan was the music he composed for the documentary about Gallipoli/Gelibolu in 2005. That soundtrack involved ethnical strings recorded in Turkey and classical melodies recorded by a symphonic orchestra and choir in the Czech Republic.

He was the younger brother of Professor Walter Garstang, FRS, a marine biologist and zoologist. Garstang is considered a pioneer in the development of scientific practices in archaeology as he kept detailed records of his excavations with extensive photographic records, which was a comparatively rare practice in early 20th-century archaeology."

He was educated at Blackburn Grammar School and in 1895 he obtained a scholarship for Jesus College, Oxford to study mathematics. While at Oxford, Garstang became interested in archaeology and conducted excavations at Ribchester. Encouraged to take up archaeology, Garstang excavated other Romano-British sites during his vacations from Oxford.After gaining a 3rd from Oxford in 1899, Garstang joined the team of Flinders Petrie at Abydos. He excavated various sites in the vicinity, including the discovery of the great tombs at Beit Khallaf in 1901. In 1902 he carried out his first independent excavation in Egypt at Reqaqnah. The excavation was funded by an excavation committee, a group of wealthy donors who in turn would receive a selection of objects from Garstang's excavations in exchange for their patronage. Like Petrie before him, Garstang would continue to use Excavation Committees to fund his excavations for most of his career.In 1902, Garstang was also appointed the honorary reader in Egyptian archaeology at the University of Liverpool. In 1904, Garstang founded the Institute of Archaeology, which was affiliated with the university. Largely funded by private benefactors, the Institute contained both a library and a museum, intended to support the work of the staff and the teaching of its students. In 2004, this museum was officially renamed the Garstang Museum of Archaeology, to celebrate the centenary of the foundation of the Institute.From 1907\u201341, Garstang was the first professorship in the methods and practice of archaeology at the university. On behalf of the institute, Garstang excavated sites in Egypt, Sudan and the Near East up to the out break of World War I. Some of his assistant excavators include E. Harold Jones, English artist and illustrator.\nHe served as the Director of the Department of Antiquities in the British Mandate of Palestine between 1920\u201326, and excavated at Ashkelon, 1920\u201321. He was also the Head of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, 1919\u201326. He also carried out a major excavation of Jericho from 1930\u201336, funded by Sir Charles Marston.He taught at the Egyptology section of the Faculty of Arts when this was established in the 1920s. One of his students was Pahor Labib, late Director of the Coptic Museum, Cairo.From 1936 to the outbreak of World War II, Garstang excavated Y\u00fcm\u00fck Tepe near Mersin. Garstang returned to Turkey after the War, and finished the excavation in 1948. In 1948, Garstang founded the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara, assisted by other Anatolian archaeologists including Winifred Lamb, and acted as its first director (he was succeeded by Seton Lloyd)."

The native of Holyoke, Massachusetts, threw and batted left-handed, stood 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and weighed 190 pounds (86 kg).\nMarquis signed his first baseball contract with the Orioles on September 2, 1955, and his first professional appearance came at the Major League level 23 days later. On September 25 at Griffith Stadium against the Washington Senators, Marquis replaced fellow Massachusetts-born rookie Angelo Dagres as the Orioles' right fielder in the eighth inning. He had no chances in the field during his one inning of play, then grounded out against Washington's Bob Chakales in the top of the ninth frame.  Veteran Cal Abrams then took Marquis' place as the right fielder in the Baltimore lineup.Sent to the lower reaches of Baltimore's minor league system in both 1956 and 1957 to gain playing experience, Marquis batted only .225 at the Class D level, and was shifted to first baseman and then southpaw pitcher (compiling a 2\u20132 record), before leaving baseball at the end of the 1957 season at the age of 20.He died at 67 in Holyoke in 2004."

Involved in activism for over 20 years, Abbas has been active in mobilizing worker support during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 and its aftermath.  His approach emphasizes peaceful strikes and rallies accompanied by demands for better wages and working conditions, as well as more regular elections for union officials, and an independent union system.\nHe began his work by organizing a strike at a steel plant in Helwan, Egypt in 1989, for which he was arrested, tortured, and fired.  That incident led to his starting the CTUWS and advocating for workers' rights throughout Egypt.  Abbas' relationship with Mubarak's regime was tense and marked by conflicts with the government and multiple arrests. The Los Angeles Times called Abbas \"a major annoyance\" to President Hosni Mubarak's regime, and \"passionate, methodical and accustomed to police surveillance.\"In 2007, Abbas was charged with defamation and sentenced to one year of prison.  There was international condemnation of the ruling, with major labor and human rights groups defending Abbas.  In February 2012 he was once again sentenced to a prison term, this time six months for \"insulting\" a public official.\nAbbas' work gained momentum and attention during the 2011 Egyptian revolution, where he helped mobilize workers in the nationwide movement for civil rights and the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak's regime."

While under the Mubarak regime, Abbas began organizing workers, despite unions being dominated by the state-approved Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF). In 1989 he participated in a strike at the Iron and Steel Company plant in Helwan where 19,000 workers sought wage increases and a meal during work.  They were met by 10,000 riot police who fired rubber bullets and tear gas at the striking workers; ultimately the strike was broken up when security forces stormed the plant, resulting on one death, one hundred injuries and hundreds of arrests.Abbas was arrested four times in the subsequent months, including 45 days of detention in which he was tortured. Following, he was terminated for participating in an \"illegal\" strike not sanctioned by the official trade union.Several months later in 1990, Abbas co-founded CTUWS in Helwan to support workers and address the lack of independent unions in the private sector.  He was guided by the advice of Yusuf Darwish, a long-time communist and labor lawyer, with whom Abbas had previously led the People's Socialist Party.  Abbas had studied world labor movements, looking up to the power of unions in Europe and the Solidarity movement in Poland in the 1980s. Abbas changed his ideological focus from his early ties to Marxist politics, instead focusing CTUWS on practical reform."

        "content": "Abbas' relationship with Mubarak's regime was tense and marked by conflicts with the government and multiple arrests.In 1998 Abbas commented on the July strikes at the Egypt-Helwan Textiles Factory and the Nasr Pharmaceutical plant.  Abbas saw the incidents as a test of the future of privatisation.  He said, \"People can now see that there is a choice, that they can say no.\"In 1999 he spoke out on the need for education and training for workers.  He said, \"In Korea, development was based on a comprehensive educational policy. We still do not see this happening here. Even in the new factories, production lines are imported with a foreign expert to run them. They are assembly plants and the Egyptian worker does not have to be very skilled. The Egyptian worker does not gain the kind of knowledge that can make him an interactive part of the production process.\"In the 2000 Parliamentary elections, Abbas nominated himself as an independent labor representative for Helwan. Abbas said that his General Union for Mineral, Electrical, and Engineering Industries at first refused to grant him status as a labor representative. According to Abbas, he received it, \"Following a long and exhausting struggle with the general union council.\" He also criticized the candidacy of Minister Sayed Mash'al and supported Safir Nigm for minister of military production in the Helwan area.  Abbas argued, \"After Mash'al took over, there was a massive explosion at one of the factories. Five workers died and compensation was inadequate. When workers complained, [Mash'al] had dozens of them sent to jail.\"In 2001 Abbas commented on the increasing privatisation of employment and the role of professional committees. He said, \"Approximately 50 per cent of the number of trade union members who make up the current trade union structure belong to and vote for 'professional committees.'\" Drivers in the Helwan district, Abbas said, are members of a professional committee, as are the construction workers in Shubra. \"These are committees that have few functions. For example, a driver will only go to his union when getting his licence because he needs their signature. We cannot consider these committees or their members active components of the trade union structure or the working class.\" He noted the changing nature of political alliances regarding unions:  \"And this time around, the left has changed its election programme from calling for the protection of the public sector to focusing on the protection of workers' rights, irrespective of who the management is.\"In 2002 a Unified Labour Law came up for parliamentary debate to replace labour law 137, passed in 1981. Abbas criticized exclusions in the bill which left out government administration, domestic work, workers' families, short-term workers (less than six months), principal management, and self-employed workers, and \"pure\" agricultural work when done by women and minors.In 2003 Abbas began seeking formal registration in line with Article 11 of Law 84/2002, which deals with NGO registration, security and public order.  Abbas was critical of the registration procedures:  \"The law is bad and it is designed to co-opt you under government control.  And there has been heavy government pressure.  But we decided to try and open negotiations with them.  After all, in Egypt you never know what is going to happen\u2014things could get even worse tomorrow.\" Abbas fought attempts to exclude the words \"worker\" and \"trade union\" from the organization name or scope.  \"They wanted us to change our name, but we won't, it's internationally recognized.  They said the name breaches Article 11.  We said no, Article 11 has to do with your goals...They said that our work could breach article 11. 'Your problem is that you speak for workers in disputes, and this we can not allow.  There are government agencies and organizations that already do this, and you cannot have face to face meetings [on these issues].'\"In 2005 Abbas was critical of how workers' rights were being addressed in the political dialogue.  He said, \"Unfortunately, the labour movement's democratic demands are absent from the agenda of change called for by the opposition. Even the political parties that are close to workers' circles\u2014such as the Tagammu and Nasserist parties\u2014are only interested now in the laws that regulate political participation and professional syndicates.\"  He told the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, \"Political movements that once upheld the interests of the working class based themselves on public sector workers, most of whom have been liquidated through early retirement schemes...the current environment where workers see people taking on the state and putting up a fight has created a situation in which we can see renewed labour activism of the sort now taking place...I do not think that such a movement would have been possible if it were not for the current movement for political reform.\"In 2005 Abbas criticized the negotiations in the Esco workers' protest. He noted that clause 69 of the labor contract, which stipulated workers could be fired if they fail to perform \"essential duties\", was broad enough to permit random firings. Abbas also criticized requirements that protests be approved by the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU).  He said, \"Workers go on strike to improve their material conditions.  They are not staging a play. They are not rehearsing for some media circus. And they should not be forced to strike within the straitjacket of a preset timetable. This defeats the purpose of the strike because it limits the workers' bargaining power.\"In June 2005 Abbas commented on legal issues dealing with the Al-Amrya Weaving and Textile Company.  He said, \"The distinction between public and private sector workers will in any case become irrelevant, sooner or later, given that the entire public sector is on the block. What is important in this case is that the Unified Labour Law (12) of 2003 doesn't differentiate between private and public sector workers. Misr Al-Amrya cannot legally argue on the basis of state workers' rights to base salary increments versus private sector workers' non-rights. Which is why, in the end, the company did eventually comply.\"In July 2005 Abbas was attacked by plain-clothes Egyptian security forces while demonstrating against human rights abuses by the Mubarak regime.  He was badly wounded.In 2005 Abbas also criticized the Muslim Brotherhood for being two-faced in their approach to civil rights. \"Egypt has never had democracy. For now the Brotherhood stands for civil rights, but its basic stance is against them. It has one language for the media and another for its followers.\"In November 2006 Abbas dismissed the significance of General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU) elections, arguing that public sector industrial workers overseen by the GFTU were increasingly few.  He recommended switching focus to ununionized private sector workers:  \"The minister of investment has openly stated that except for four companies the little that remains of the industrial public sector is for sale...the real battle is to fight for trade union pluralism, to build a new and independent trade union structure.\""

        "content": "In November 2007 Abass criticized the government sale of companies to international investors, arguing the transactions led to workers losing their jobs.In 2007 he criticized the state of politics, calling the regime illegitimate, and saying that Egypt is \"a suffering society with no way to express itself.\" He speculated that poverty in Cairo could lead to a violent confrontation with the police. Abbas envisioned a charismatic opposition leader who could rise up amidst the tension, but he did not believe such an individual would be part of the labor movement.  He said, \"Those who think the labor movement will lead to political change in Egypt are foolish.  The movement is still too young. We have to be concerned with the economic conditions of the workers. We can't rush things.\"In April 2007 Abbas' CTUWS office was shut down and he was accused of working with \"external forces\" in order to disrupt the country's economy.  The government closed CTUWS' Helwan headquarters and two other branches in Nag' Hamadi and Mehala Al-Kobra for \"security reasons\".In September 2007 Abbas and another writer were convicted of defamation and public abuse after writer Mohamed Helmy published an article on corruption at the 15th of May Youth Center, where Abbas was a member of the board. The story was published in Kalam Sanay'iya, a magazine published by the CTUWS.  The lawsuit for alleged \"slander and defamation of character\" against Abbas\u2014and his co-defendant lawyer Mohamed Helmi\u2014was filed by Mohamed Mustafa Ibrahim, chairman of the board of directors at the youth center. Ibrahim filed three petitions against Abbas and claimed that the magazine article \"publicly defamed him as a state-appointed civil servant\". He based his case on Article 188 of the Egyptian code of law, which penalizes false reporting (anyone who \"publishes false news, statements or rumours likely to disturb public order\" may face a prison sentence).  Abbas was sentenced to one year in prison.About the incident, Abbas commented to National Public Radio, \"The government is also very sensitive about any links between political powers in Egypt and the labor movement because this would mean that workers might enter with their weight into the democratic movement. They're very scared of this.\"\"It is clear the judge's decision to give me a one-year jail sentence is political...It is no coincidence that I was sentenced at about the same time as the journalists and editors,\" Abbas told Ahram Weekly. \"The court had regularly adjourned the case since May, deciding to issue a ruling only on 21 September. Prosecuting and sentencing journalists for publishing offences is all part of the government's general crack-down on civil liberties.  The government feels threatened by the strikes, especially actions taken by the militant Mehala Al-Kubra textile workers whose latest strike was settled last week. They need a scapegoat for their failed policies. This is why they closed down our offices, refuse to license us and continue to accuse the CTUWS of inciting the strikes. The allegations are flattering but untrue. How could we possibly have incited the tens of thousands of workers who have gone on strike since December?\" he said.CTUWS criticized the conviction. \"What does it mean when courts seek to imprison citizens, who publish the facts about corruption cases? The allegations against Ibrahim were found to be true and were the basis for the legal decision... Does it mean that the courts are offering immunity to corrupt officials, that they are offering protection against any criticism or disclosure?\"International labor and human rights groups came out in support of Abbas and condemned the court decision. The International Confederation of Trade Unions (ITUC), accused the Mubarak regime of going after opposition groups and media.  \"We are very concerned about this latest attack on the CTUWS.  We are particularly concerned that these prison sentences follow a long tradition of repression of the CTUWS, an independent civil society organization committed to defending trade union and workers rights in Egypt,\" said Guy Ryder, ITUC general secretary. A coalition of the Italian trade unions sent a letter to Mubarak asking him to \"ensure that CTUWS is not persecuted and demanding that \"this particular case could be reviewed.  The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network also issued a statement \"expressing its deep concern over the case.Egyptian labour historian Joel Beinin said, \"The attack on CTUWS is part of the intensification of the assault of the Mubarak regime against its opponents\". Faiza Rady considered the prison sentence an attack on the defence of workers' rights.After Abbas' and Helmy's September conviction, an investigation by the Governor of Cairo found the charges of corruption at the youth center to be true.  Cairo Governor Abdel Azim Wazir ordered the entire board of the center to be disbanded.Abbas appealed his conviction at a 29 Dec. hearing.  He and Helmy remained free between the case and the appeal.In 2009 Human Rights Watch noted a significant increase \"in the harassment of human rights activists at Cairo airport\", which included the detainment of Abbas.In 2010 the Egyptian Minister of Planning created a committee regarding minimum wage, which Abbas criticized for not acting.  Abbas supported working with the new committee's goals, which included a minimum annual salary increase of seven per cent. He also criticized the labour complaints committee for not meeting regularly.In 2010 Abbas criticized proposals to postpone trade union elections.  Abbas criticized the role of the ETUF as \"a governmental institution, not a federation of genuine trade unions. Nor does it represent Egypt's workers in any way.\" Abbas also noted the practice of elected officials busing in members of their constituency to vote.In May 2010 Abbas criticized the forced end of a protest in Cairo by workers from Amonsito, the Egyptian Telephone Company and el-Nubaria Agricultural Engineering, who had been protesting for several months.  Abbas had said he would submit a complaint to the International Labour Organization about the incident.In August 2010 Abbas criticized the constitutionality of military courts being used on civilians working in military production facilities.Also in August Abbas criticized ETUF head Megawer of being an appointed labor representative in positions that are mandated to be elected.  Abbas also criticized Megawer's affiliation with the National Democratic Party (NDP), suggesting that the ETUF should not be determining eligibility for parliamentary elections.  Abbas argued, \"The ETUF has actually granted a number of businessmen and retired officers, from the ruling party, the status of labor representatives when they are not laborers in any way shape or form.\""

        "content": "During the revolution, Abbas made an appeal for new trade unions at Tahrir Square.  He said, \u201cOn January 30th we met with representative of other independent trade union organizations and we discussed forming a new federation.  We then made an announcement in Tahrir square, calling for a new federation. But at the time we had no idea what would happen. Since then this call has been responded to by the workers. The challenge now that the revolution has succeeded is to be able to build a society of social justice.\u201dIn February 2011 Abbas criticized the elections in federation syndicates for being corrupt with fraud.  He said, \"There are 116 verdicts of administrative court annulling the last union elections and we believe members of the federation were involved in acts of violence against the protesters in Tahrir\".  Abbas recommended creating independent syndicates, saying, \"We will do as our grandfathers did before 1952 when the first unions were created in Egypt\".Also in February, Abbas supported strikes motivated by \"how many billions the Mubarak family was worth.\"In May 2011 Abbas celebrated International Workers' Day (also known as \"May Day\"), the international socialist commemoration of workers' rights reform begun in the United States.  Abbas deemed that year's celebrations  \"historic\" for marking a break from the ETUF.  Abbas also praised the then newly formed Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions (EITUF).  May Day celebrations focused on the free will of Egyptian workers to form independent trade unions, free from state control, and the dismantling of the ETUF.In June 2011, Abbas was co-filer of a lawsuit calling for the dissolution of the state-controlled ETUF.  The suit called for \"sequestration of the ETUF headquarters, buildings, its Workers' University, cultural institute, hospitals and clinics\" as well as \"barring the ETUF from representing Egypt's workers or unions at international conferences\".Abbas interrupted the ETUF's Ismail Fahmy during his speech at the International Labour Organization (ILO) June 2011 conference.  Abbas criticized the ETUF saying, \"Enough ... all these years ... and crimes enough! ... Enough you killers! ... You participated in the passage of the privatization deals, and facilitated and justified the blatant attacks on the rights of workers ... You defended with impunity Mubarak's regime with its corruption, repression and tyranny, and then you plotted against the killing of the revolutionaries in Tahrir Square!\"During the 2011 revolution Abbas made a video from Tahrir Square telling American workers who were on strike in Wisconsin:\n\n\"From this place, I want you to know that we stand with you as you stood with us.  I want you to know that no power can challenge the will of the people when they believe in their rights.  When they raise their voices loud and clear and struggle against exploitation.  No one believed that our revolution could succeed against the strongest dictatorship in the region.  But in 18 days the revolution achieved the victory of the people\u2026.We want you to know that we stand on your side.  Stand firm and don\u2019t waiver.  Don\u2019t give up on your rights.  Victory always belongs to the people who stand firm and demand their just rights.  We and all the people of the world stand on your side and give you our full support.  As our just struggle for freedom, democracy and justice succeeded, your struggle will succeed.  Victory belongs to you when you stand firm and remain steadfast in demanding your just rights.\"\nIn March 2011, Abbas participated in a labour panel discussing the future of trade unions following the fall of Mubarak's regime.  At the end of the panel, Abbas declared, \"the regime has fallen...the Egyptian Federation of Trade Unions has fallen!  What more do you want?  Go create your own unions!\"On 29 February 2012, the CTUWS reported that Abbas had been sentenced in absentia to six months in prison for \"insulting\" a public official."

He started playing for the local \"Golden Lion\" team like both of his parents, and still plays regularly for his pub team \"The Masons\"He first came to prominence in 2006, winning the 2006 WDF Europe Cup, and making the semi-finals of the 2006 Winmau World Masters. In other BDO/WDF tournaments during 2006, he won the Northern Ireland Open and reached the semi-finals of the Welsh Open. However, he underperformed in the subsequent 2007 World Championship, losing on his debut to Tony Eccles 3\u20130 in the first round.\nIn May 2007, he beat Phil Taylor in the group stages on his way to the final of the International Darts League \u2013 however he lost 9\u201313 to Gary Anderson. However, he added to his growing collection of titles by winning the World Cup Singles in October 2007.\nDespite his lack of major television tournament wins, Webster entered the 2008 BDO World Championship as the number one seed due to his success in open events. This time around, Webster justified his status as joint-favourite for the title (alongside Anderson), as he beat Ian Jones in the first round, popular qualifier Glenn Moody in the last 16 and ninth seed Darryl Fitton in the quarter-finals. He played defending champion Martin Adams in the semi-finals, beating him 6\u20134 and earning a place in the final. He then beat Simon Whitlock 7\u20135 in the final on 13 January 2008, to become the third Welshman to win the World Championship of either organisation, after Leighton Rees and Richie Burnett, and only the second left-handed player to win the World Championship in either the PDC or BDO.\nWebster did not play many tournaments in 2008, instead choosing to remain in college to earn his plumbing degree. He did though retain the WDF Europe Cup, beating Northern Ireland's Daryl Gurney in the final. Webster also had a great run into the quarter finals of the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts. After surprisingly losing his opening group game to Colin McGarry, he went on to whitewash Michael van Gerwen 5\u20130 and despite losing to Mervyn King, Webster went through to the knockout stages on leg difference after McGarry failed to beat van Gerwen. Webster then demolished PDC World Champion John Part 10\u20132 \u2013 in a battle of the incumbent world champions \u2013 to reach the quarter finals where he lost again to King. Webster then suffered a last 16 exit in the 2008 World Masters, losing to Ross Montgomery and then went out in the group stages of the Zuiderduin Masters. Having beaten Martin Atkins, he lost to wildcard entrant Henny van der Ster who claimed the quarter final spot ahead of Webster and went on to reach the semi-finals.\nWebster entered the 2009 BDO World Championship as the number two seed. He defeated Dutchman Willy van de Wiel 3\u20130 in the first round but his title reign came to an end in the second round when he was beaten 4\u20130 by 2001 Lakeside Champion John Walton."

Neumann's starling (Onychognathus neumanni) and several other species are named after him.\n\nNeumann was born in wealthy Jewish family, the son of Maximilian and Anna n\u00e9e Meyer.

He travelled to German East Africa across Tanganyika, Uganda and Kenya in 1892 and collected for the Berlin Museum publishing descriptions. In 1899 he accompanied Baron Carlo von Erlanger through Somaliland and southern Ethiopia, collecting birds that went to Lord Walter Rothschild's bird collection in Tring. In 1915 he went to New Guinea and also made an expedition to Sulawesi in 1938 sponsored by the specimen collector and dealer J. J. Menden. In 1908 he lost much of his money and was hoping to work for Rothschild in Tring but this did not materialize as Rothschild himself ran into financial problems. Neumann then took to stock-broking in Berlin. In 1941, with the help of his friend Julius Riemer he fled Nazi Germany, traveling from Berlin to Cuba, then to Chicago, where he worked the final years of his life as a curator in the Field Museum of Natural History.\nHe was elected to the British Ornithologists' Union in 1897 but resigned in 1910 due to financial reasons.

Sukkhongdumnoen had to deal with tough crowds at the start of the tournament, as she upset the Greek favorite and two-time Olympian Areti Athanasopoulou on the marginal judging decision, resulting to a 6\u20136 draw and a storming protest from the opposition.

        "content": "Marty Ravellette was the fourth child of the farm family of Ernest D. Ravellette and Laurene Ravellette (n\u00e9e Frohreich). He was born without arms. Faced with the challenge of this disability, his family was convinced to place him at the age of two months in the Good Shepherd Home, known today as the Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The main practice at Good Shepherd was mainstreaming, and they trained Ravellette to use his legs and feet as arms and hands and to use an early prosthetic arm that he later stopped using. Ravellette was not the first armless person at the Good Shepherd Home \u2013 that was the musician Ray Meyers, who was an inspiration to Ravellette. Ravellette favored his left foot similar to left handed people. Ravellete was known to entertain people with his use of feet and body to do tricks.While there, Ravellette attended Allentown public schools, starting with Jefferson Elementary School and then South Mountain Junior High. At age 11, Ravellette suffered burns from a fire accident. At age 16, Ravellette rejoined his family partly because he was a discipline problem, but he had in fact been initially barred from attending the public high school by the contemporary public school principle equating physical handicaps with mental handicaps. Ravellette's mother sued the school and produced transcripts from his public school years while living at Good Shepherd in Allentown. \nWhile attending an Allentown public high school, Ravellete's reputation was built by his rebellious and confrontational attitude. He \"didn't back down\", as the 2003 documentary on him cited when fellow students picked on him. However, he said, \"For the first time, I felt like I was a cripple.\". He credited his rebelliousness with not being afraid of work, an attribute he said he developed from working on a farm, where his family did not have running water. At one point, it was Ravellette's job to fill water troughs from a hand pump. For the high school prom Ravellette recalled he was denied a date saying \"Marty, when I want to get married I want to marry a man, not half a one.\"After graduating circa 1957, the family moved to Oceanside, California and Ravellette ran away from home. In San Diego, Ravellette began to work in a variety of jobs. While he was unemployed in 1962, he drove from Los Angeles to his home on San Diego, where he was pulled over in a line of cars for speeding. After taking his driver's license, the officer noticed that he was handed the license by Ravellette's foot. After proving he had a valid driver's license, he let Ravellette go with a citation. The incident was covered nationally by Associated Press and was read by JoBeth Johnson in Florida, who struck up a long-distance relationship with Ravellette that grew to a marriage after Ravellette moved to Klamath Falls, Oregon in 1963. They lived there a number of years; he, a member of the Church of Christ and she a Baptist. Together they had a daughter, Nancy (who was born with arms.) and a son who died as a child in a car accident.In 1967, after attending community college, Ravellette moved to San Diego, where he lived in a boarding house, and performed parlor tricks. There, he met Ray Estes, who pointed out he was being used for amusement by those who were not his friends. In the same period, Estes noticed he was much more agile with his feet and remarked, \"If God has seen fit to put you on earth without arms, it's up to the rest of us to accept you - not you to accept us.\" which Ravellette took as a turning point in his life. Estes and Ravellette would be long time friends. Estes had joined the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in 1966 and Ravellette also converted to the religion in 1967. Soon his mother and wife were visible serving in the religion and the Ravellettes had a second child May 21, 1970, after they moved to Eugene, Oregon. Marcus Husayn Ravellette - \"Husayn\" is a name recognized in Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed circles as the birth-name of the founder, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. However, on June 11, 1975, Marcus was killed in an automobile accident and buried as a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed. Marty and JoBeth divorced some time afterwards. Ravellete moved to Teaneck, New Jersey, where he became a grounds keeper at the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed property there. It was near there in Paramus, New Jersey that he met the woman who would be his next wife - Maree."

He appeared on several national television shows, including Discovery Channel, which won an Award of Merit by Carolina Silver Reels and other shows though initially he had sought no publicity. Following this he had the opportunity to go back to Good Shepherd in Allentown, Pennsylvania for a reunion and began a period of reconnecting with his family while at the same time he met his future wife. He also began to speak publicly, including as a frequent guest at a journalism class of Chuck Stone at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and elsewhere, using stories of his life and physical challenges to underpin larger lessons on the benefits of diversity, justice, equality, and the unity of humankind. Inspired by his beliefs as a long-time member of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, he often quoted one of his favorite lines from Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed literature, \"Noble have I created thee; why hast thou abased thyself\" and observed that he was in a special position to serve humanity because of his differences, saying \"Why was I born? Why was I born with no arms? Now serve mankind with no arms and not yourself!\" he met Tony Melendez, a performer who similarly armless.On November 12, 2007, Ravellette was in a car accident in southern Alamance County, North Carolina at Highway 87, where Eli Whitney, North Carolina is located.

She was an actress with the travelling Elfforss Theater Company and from 1886 to 1888 served as its director.\nShe took over the leadership of the theater company during her husband's illness and formally after his death in 1869.As an actress, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Elfforss started in roles as ingenue and heroine but moved on to character roles in modern Nordic and foreign plays of the new realistic movement. According to a critic: \"Her performances was characterized by spirituality, fine details, lively vitality\", and in recognition of her ability, she was given the sobriquet \"The Elise Hwasser of the countryside\", after the renowned actress of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, who was at that time regarded the greatest actress in Sweden.Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Elfforss enjoyed great respect during her career, particularly in her capacity as a director: \n\n\"Mrs E. was the most noted women theater director in 19th-century Sweden, and the Elfforss company was regarded as the best travelling theater in the nation during the 1870s and 1880s. The repertoire as well as the acting was of the highest level, and the director was widely respected and loved for her excellent personal virtues. As regard to the financial side of the affairs Mrs E. would likely be uncontested among all travelling theater directors. She belong to the very few among them, who were able to leave a small fortune at her passing.\"As director, she focused on Nordic plays, such as Swedish plays by F. A. Dahlgren, C. Axel Anrep,  Emilie Lundberg, but also Lorentz Dietrichson, Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson and Ibsen.  Her greatest financial success was, however, Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne, and she also staged less serious operettas, because \"During the grand days of the Elfforss company in the 1870s and 1880s, the taste for operettas was so great that such an economic and practical director as Mrs E. could scarcely ignore it.\" Her company performed with success at the  Djurg\u00e5rdsteatern  at Djurg\u00e5rden in Stockholm, and toured Finland in 1869, 1870, 1874, 1877 and 1878.\nIn 1888, she transformed the leadership to stage director and theatre manager  August Lindberg (1846\u20131916)  after which the theater company changed its name to the Lindeberg Theater Company. She  continued to perform in the Lindeberg company until 1893.  Between 1890 and 1893, the Lindeberg company staffed the Stora Teatern in Gothenburg.   When the Lindeberg company was dissolved in 1893, she retired with her son Julius Erik Engelbrekt Elfforss  (1847- 1925) to Stockholm  where she died in 1905."

At that time, wallpaper was becoming popular among the bourgeoisie as a creative and economical way to decorate interior spaces. During the Seven Years' War Reveillon started to produce wallpaper himself, marrying well and using his wife's dowry to produce velvet paper, pasted up into rolls and using vibrant colours, developed by Jean-Baptiste Pillement.\n\nIn 1759 he moved to the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, then a neighbourhood dominated by the various crafts associated with furnishing. R\u00e9veillon launched production of a full range of wallpapers. The nobility began to patronize his business and in 1765\u2014--already extremely wealthy--\u2014he bought a mansion, with a parc and a theatre inside La Folie Titon, formerly owned by \u00c9vrard Titon du Tillet. Reveillon installed his wallpaper factory on the ground floor, retaining the upper floors for his private residence.\nIn 1775 R\u00e9veillon opened a paper mill to improve both the quantity and quality of his paper supply. In 1776 he opened a shop near the Tuileries. The papier bleu d'Angleterre became very popular when Queen Marie Antoinette decorated her apartments with them. R\u00e9veillon himself dabbled in chemistry enough to discover a new process for making vellum paper in 1782. The following year he was granted permission to use the title of Manufacture Royale.\nHis purchase of the paper mill and expertise in paper production brought him into contact with Etienne de Montgolfier, and it was from R\u00e9veillon's garden at Folie Titon that the first hot-air balloon was launched on 12 September 1783. R\u00e9veillon delivered a special and colourful wallpaper, used as a cover for the balloon. A second balloon, called Le R\u00e9veillon, with a rooster, a duck and a sheep was launched a week later at Versailles. On 19 October his employee Andr\u00e9 Giroud de Villette and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier went into the sky, as pioneers of flight.\n\nIn the year 1789 R\u00e9veillon was the casualty of his own reflections on modern economics. \"Since bread was the foundation of our national economy,\" he stated in an essay, \"its distribution should be deregulated, permitting lower prices. That in turn would allow lower wage costs, lower manufacturing prices and brisk consumption.\" This musing was misinterpreted by an already angry Parisian populace, who believed that Monseigneur Reveillon was advocating a lowering in wages. On 28 April 1789 his mansion was attacked and looted by an angry mob, all the wallpaper, glue, furniture and paintings were burned. His wine cellar, containing 2,000 bottles of wine, was pillaged and quickly consumed by the riotous mob. R\u00e9veillon and his family escaped by climbing a wall and fleeing to the nearby Bastille. It was a bloody day, some say 25 people dying in the ensuing melee. The rioters were eventually dispersed in an opening episode of the French Revolution. Today plaques mark the site of the Reveillon riot.\n\nR\u00e9veillon emigrated to England with his fortune intact, and after the French Revolution, leased his manufacture to Jacquemart & B\u00e9rnard, who continued to produce wallpaper till 1840."

Sommer opened his first photography studio in Switzerland, where he made relief images of mountains for the Swiss government. In 1856 moved his business to Naples and later (1866) formed a partnership with fellow German photographer Edmund Behles (also known as Edmondo Behles), who owned a studio in Rome. Operating from their respective Naples and Rome studios, Sommer and Behles became one of the largest and most prolific photography concerns in Italy.\nHe held studios in Naples at:\n\nStrada di Chiaia 168\nVia Monte di Dio 4 and 8\nPiazza della VittoriaSommer's catalog included images from the Vatican Museum, the National Archeological Museum at Naples, the Roman ruins at Pompeii, as well as street and architectural scenes of Naples, Florence, Rome, Capri and Sicily. Most notably, Sommer published his comprehensive album Dintorni di Napoli, which contained over one hundred images of everyday scenes in Naples. In April 1872, he documented a very large eruption of Mount Vesuvius in a series of stunning photographs.\nSommer and Behles exhibited extensively and earned numerous honors and prizes for their work (London 1862, Paris 1867, Vienna 1873, Nuremberg 1885). At one time, Sommer was appointed official photographer to King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy.\nSommer was involved in every aspect of the photography business. He published his own images that he sold in his studios and to customers across Europe. In later years, he photographed custom images for book illustrations, as well as printing his own albums and postcards. Sommer worked in all the popular formats of his day: carte de visite, stereoview, and large albumen prints (approximately 8 \u00d7 10) which were sold individually and in bound albums.\nThe partnership with Behles ended in 1874, after which each photographer continued his own business. In Naples, Sommer opened a total of four additional studios: at No. 4 and No. 8 Monte di Dio, No. 5 Magazzino S. Caterina, and a last at Piazza della Vittoria.\nSommer died in Naples in 1914."

His overseer, Karl August von Hardenberg, quickly recognized his talent and encouraged him to join the diplomatic corps. In 1799, he went with Hardenberg to Berlin where he worked for as a Ministerialrat and later became a senior financial officer for the general directorate. As a result of Prussia's losses in the Fourth Coalition War of the Napoleonic Wars at the battle of Jena-Auerstedt, he went with Hardenberg in 1806 to Tilsit to work on the Prussian Reforms.\nPlans for insurrection against the French occupation stalled the state minister Karl Freiherr vom Stein's reform plans. In 1808, Altenstein became his successor as the head of administration of Finance. He could not prevail against the forces set in motion by his predecessor to introduce reform so he continued them with the same energy. In 1810, Prussia could no longer afford the reparations agreed to in the Peace of Tilsit. Altenstein suggested the cessation of Silesia to France and so was dismissed in June by King Frederick William III at the instigation of Hardenberg.\nAfter his release, he went to Breslau where he was appointed civil governor of Silesia in 1813. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, he, together with Wilhelm von Humboldt in Paris, reclaimed treasures that had been confiscated by Napoleon.In 1817, he took over as head of the newly formed Ministry of Culture, again answering to Hardenberg, now State Chancellor. He was charged with the political responsibility of refounding the Evangelical Church in Prussia. In the next 20 years he reformed the Prussian schools, radically changing education. He is credited with the first \"humanistic\" school of education and the University of Bonn in 1818. With the Education Act of 1819, he developed a master plan for the system that still persists today: a multi-unit school system with a differentiation between primary and secondary education. In 1825, he extended compulsory education to the entire country, and in 1834, he introduced a mandatory curriculum for Gymnasiums. In subsequent years, he fought for the education system to be independent of the church."

        "content": "In 1840 he was apprenticed to his father's printing business in London, being subsequently taken into partnership. The firm was afterwards known as Blades, East & Blades. His interest in printing led him to make a study of the volumes produced by William Caxton's press, and of the early history of printing in England.His Life and Typography of William Caxton, England's First Printer, was published in 1861\u20131863, and the conclusions which he set forth were arrived at by a careful examination of types in the early books, each class of type being traced from its first use to the time when, spoilt by wear, it passed out of Caxton's hands. Some 450 volumes from the Caxton Press were thus carefully compared and classified in chronological order.In 1877 Blades took an active part in organizing the Caxton celebration, and strongly supported the foundation of the Library Association. He was a keen collector of old books, prints and medals. His publications relate chiefly to the early history of printing. The Enemies of Books was his most popular work, being produced in 1880. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1882.On his death, his library was acquired by the St Bride Foundation as the initial collection of the library. The architect of the St Bride Foundation building, Robert Cunningham Murray, created a room to house the collection that was a near replica of Blade's original library."

Much of the band's sound is inspired by Romani and Ukrainian music mixed with punk and dub, incorporating accordion and violin (and on some albums, saxophone).The band has appeared in several popular films, most notably Everything Is Illuminated (2005) in which lead singer Eugene H\u00fctz co-starred with Elijah Wood in a dramedy/adventure story about the Nazi purges in Ukraine. The group appears playing a brass band in a set that included the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" and the traditional Yiddish song \"Bublitschki\".

        "content": "\"Gogol\" comes from Nikolai Gogol, a classical writer of Ukrainian origin. He serves as an ideological influence for the band because he \"smuggled\" Ukrainian culture into Russian society, which Gogol Bordello intends to do with Romani/East-European music in the English-speaking world. \"Bordello\", in Italian, refers to a brothel or a \"gentleman's club\". The band was originally titled H\u00fctz and the B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3ks, but Eugene H\u00fctz says that they decided to change the name because \"nobody knows who the hell B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k is in the United States.\" The band played their first show as the unofficial band at an after-hours club called Pizdetz where they became the house band and DJ H\u00fctz became the house DJ.Gogol Bordello's first single was released in 1999, and since then they have released six full-length albums, and one EP. In 2005 the band signed to punk label SideOneDummy Records. On 27 April 2010 Gogol Bordello made its major record label debut with Transcontinental Hustle on Rick Rubin's American Recordings, a subsidiary of Columbia Records/Sony Music Entertainment. Many of the songs on Transcontinental Hustle were inspired by H\u00fctz's move to Brazil.The band has toured extensively throughout Europe and America. They have made numerous appearances at international festivals and have toured with such diverse bands as Primus, Flogging Molly, and Cake. In an interview with NPR, frontman Eugene H\u00fctz cites Jimi Hendrix and Parliament-Funkadelic as among the band's main musical influences. They have also mentioned Manu Chao, Fugazi, Zvuki Mu, Karamelo Santo, Sasha Kolpakov and The Clash as influences.\nThey performed live at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts festival 2011 for Bonnaroo's 10 year anniversary, playing a 1.5 hour set in the middle of the night and performed with Devotchka.\nGogol Bordello released \"Let's Get Crazy\" in 2012, the new song was part of Coca-Cola's advertising campaign for the European Football Championships, which were part-hosted by Ukraine. The track samples one of their earlier singles, \"Wonderlust King\", and the Coca-Cola advertising jingle.In 2012 former guitarist Oren Kaplan sued H\u00fctz for personal damages.The 2010 song \"Immigraniada\" was remixed by Bassnectar becoming a smash hit amongst his fans hoping for a live performance anytime the band and he are in proximity to each other.\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, H\u00fctz released a video on social media condemning the Russian invasion, and has remained vocal about raising relief funds for the victims of the invasion.  Gogol Bordello announced a benefit concert shortly after which sold out quickly, followed by announcing a benefit tour. Bordello collaborated with Les Claypool of the band Primus on the song \"Man with the Iron Balls\", praising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's courage. The proceeds of the track are set to benefit Nova Ukraine, a non-profit organization that provides humanitarian relief to the people of Ukraine."

        "content": "Son of a tailor and builder, Eccles spent his childhood in the countryside of the parish of Saint Mary. Eccles had an itinerant childhood due to his father's need to travel Jamaica seeking work. He used to regularly attend church, and he became influenced by spiritual singing; In his words: \"One of my uncles was a spiritual revivalist, who always did this heavy type of spiritual singing, and I got to love that\". Eccles's professional singing career began as a teenager, working the north-coast hotel circuit in the mid-1950s.  In his late teens, he moved to Ocho Rios, where he performed at night in various shows, with artists such as The Blues Busters, Higgs & Wilson and Buster Brown. He moved to Kingston in 1959, where he started his recording career. He first recorded for Coxsone Dodd, who had organised a talent show in which Eccles took part.Eccles had a Jamaican hit in 1961 with the early ska song \"Freedom\", which was recorded in 1959, and was featured on Dodd's sound system for two years before it was released. It was one of the first Jamaican songs with socially oriented lyrics. The song discussed the concept of repatriation to Africa, an idea developed by the growing Rastafari movement. The song became the first Jamaican hit to be used for political purposes; Alexander Bustamante, founder of the Jamaican Labour Party and at that time Chief Minister of Jamaica adopted it for his fight against the Federation of the West Indies in 1960. In the following years, Eccles had other successful songs, mixing boogie/rhythm and blues influences with ska rhythms, such as \"River Jordan\" and \"Glory Hallelujah\".\nIn 1962, he started promoting concerts and set up his Christmas Morning talent show; first with Dodd, then on his own. He organised concerts for The Clarendonians in 1963, and for The Wailers in 1964 and 1965. He launched other talent search contests, with Battle of the Stars, Clancy Eccles Revue, Independent Revue and Reggae Soul Revue, from which emerged stars such as Barrington Levy and Culture.\nStarting in 1963, he recorded with producers such as Charlie Moo (Leslie Kong's business partner) and the husband of Sonia Pottinger, Lyndon. He couldn't make a living from his music, so he quit in 1965 to work as a tailor in Annotto Bay. During this period, he made stage outfits for musicians such as Kes Chin, The Mighty Vikings, Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, Carlos Malcolm and The Blues Busters.He went back to music in 1967, producing his own recordings as well as those of other artists. He scored a hit with Eric 'Monty' Morris' reggae song \"Say What You're Saying\", and with his own song \"Feel The Rhythm\", one of several records that were instrumental in the shift from rocksteady to reggae. Eccles has also been credited with deriving the name 'reggae' from streggae', Kingston slang for a good-time girl. Eccles' first hit, \"What Will Your Mama Say\" which was released by the recently created United Kingdom label, Pama Records. In 1968, his song \"Fattie Fattie\" became a skinhead reggae classic, along with his productions of recordings by the toasting DJ King Stitt (\"Fire Corner\", \"Van Cleef\", \"Herbman Shuffle\"). Eccles recorded many organ-led instrumentals with his session band The Dynamites (same band has Derrick Harriott's Crystalites), featuring Jackie Jackson, Hux Brown, Paul Douglas, Winston Wright, Gladstone Anderson, Winston Grennan, Joe Isaacs, and Hugh Malcolm, with Johnny Moore and Bobby Ellis both contributing trumpet in different sessions. In 1970, Eccles helped pave the way to the dub music genre by releasing an instrumental version of \"Herbman Shuffle\" called \"Phantom\", with a mix focusing on the bass line.\nEccles launched different record labels for his works: Clansone, New Beat and Clandisc (the latter also the name of a sub-label set up by Trojan Records for Eccles' UK releases). He recorded artists such as Alton Ellis, Joe Higgs, the Trinidian Lord Creator (\"Kingston Town\"), Larry Marshall, Hemsley Morris, Earl Lawrence, The Beltones, Glen Ricks, Cynthia Richards, Buster Brown and Beres Hammond. Appreciated by musicians for his fairness and sense of equity, he helped Lee Perry set up his Upsetter record label in 1968 after Perry left Dodd's employment, and helped Winston 'Niney' Holmes (later known as 'The Observer') record his first hit as a producer in 1971 (\"Blood & Fire\").A socialist militant, Eccles was appointed as an adviser on the music industry to Michael Manley's People's National Party (PNP) and took part in Jamaica's 1972 prime ministerial elections by organising a \"Bandwagon\" featuring musicians such as Bob Marley & the Wailers, Dennis Brown, Max Romeo, Delroy Wilson and Inner Circle, performing around the island in support of Manley's campaign. Throughout the 1970s, he remained close to Manley and wrote several songs in praise of the PNP program, including his hits \"Power for the People\", \"Rod of Correction\" or \"Generation Belly\".\nEccles' political interests meant that he spent less time on music, although in the late 1970s, Eccles had further success as a producer with recordings by Tito Simon and Exuma the Obeah Man, as well as collaborations with King Tubby. After the 1970s, new Eccles recordings were rare, and he concentrated on live concert promotion and re-issues of his back catalogue. In the 1980s, Eccles slowed down his musical activities, and he never met success again, apart from a few political songs, such as \"Dem Mash Up The Country\" in 1985. Eccles died on 30 June 2005, in Spanish Town Hospital from complications of a heart attack.\nEccles' son, Clancy Eccles Jr., has followed his father into the music business, initially performing as simply \"Clancy\"."

        "content": "Robert Emmet (4 March 1778 \u2013 20 September 1803) was an Irish Republican, orator and rebel leader. Following the suppression of the United Irish uprising in 1798, he sought to organise a renewed attempt to overthrow the British Crown and Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland, and to establish a nationally representative government. Emmet entertained, but ultimately abandoned, hopes of immediate French assistance and of coordination with radical militants in Great Britain. In Ireland, many of the surviving veterans of '98 hesitated to lend their support, and his rising in Dublin in 1803 proved abortive.\nEmmet\u2019s Proclamation of the Provisional Government to the People of Ireland, his Speech from the Dock, and his \"sacrificial\" end on the gallows inspired later generations of Irish republicans. Patrick Pearse, who in 1916 was again to proclaim a provisional government in Dublin, declared Emmet's attempt \"not a failure, but a triumph for that deathless thing we call Irish Nationality\"."

        "content": "Emmet was born at 109 St. Stephen's Green, in Dublin on 4 March 1778. He was the youngest son of Dr Robert Emmet (1729\u20131802), physician to the Lord Lieutenant, and his wife, Elizabeth Mason (1739\u20131803). The Emmets were financially comfortable, members of the Protestant Ascendancy with a house at St Stephen's Green and a country residence near Milltown.\nDr. Emmet supported the cause of American independence and was a well-known figure on the fringes of the Irish patriot movement. Theobald Wolfe Tone, a friend of Emmet's elder brother, Thomas Addis Emmet, and an advocate of more radical reform, including Catholic Emancipation, was a visitor to the house. So too, as a friend of his father, was Dr William Drennan, the original proposer of the \"benevolent conspiracy--a plot for the people\" that was to call itself, at Tone's suggestion, the Society of United Irishmen.\nEmmet entered Trinity College Dublin in October 1793 as a precocious fifteen-year-old and excelled as a student of history and chemistry. In December 1797 he joined the College Historical Society. His brother Thomas and Wolfe Tone, preceding him in the society, had maintained its lively tradition (stretching back to Edmund Burke) of defying the College's injunction against discussing questions of \"modern politics\".Fellow Society member Thomas Moore recalled that men \"of advanced standing and reputation for oratory, came to attend our debates, expressly for the purpose of answering [Robert] Emmet\". His eloquence was unmatched.  In the preface to his Irish Melodies (1837), he recounts Emmet \"ardently\" taking the side of Democracy in the debate \"Whether an Aristocracy or a Democracy is most favourable to the advancement of science and literature?\"  and, in \"another of his remarkable speeches\", saying, \"When a people, advancing rapidly in knowledge and power, perceive at last how far their government is lagging behind them, what then, I ask, is to be done in such a case? What, but to pull the government up to the people?\"Robert Emmet is described by his contemporaries as slight in person; his features were regular, his forehead high, his eyes bright and full of expression, his nose sharp, thin, and straight, the lower part of his face slightly pock-marked, his complexion sallow."

        "content": "While Emmet hid in Rathfarnham, yeomen sought to extract information from Anne Devlin, prodding her with bayonets and half hanging her until she passed out. Had he not insisted on taking his leave of his fianc\u00e9e Sarah Curran (daughter of the disapproving John Philpot Curran) he may have succeeded in joining Dowdall and Byrne in France. Emmet was captured on 25 August and taken to the Castle, then removed to Kilmainham. Vigorous but ineffectual efforts were made to procure his escape.Emmet was tried and convicted for high treason on 19 September. The evidence against him had been overwhelming, but the Crown took the extra precaution of suborning his defence attorney, Leonard McNally, for \u00a3200 and a pension. McNally's assistant Peter Burrowes could not be bought and represented Emmet as best he could.Emmet's instruction, however, was not to offer a defence: he would not call any witnesses, \"or to take up the time of the court\". When on announcing this, McNally proposed that the trial was concluded, the prosecuting counsel William Plunket took to his feet. In what was widely regarded as an unnecessary attack on a doomed man, Plunket, who was to see himself appointed Solicitor-General, mocked Emmet as the deluded leader of a conspiracy encompassing \"the bricklayer, the old clothes man, the hodman and the hostler\".Emmet's Speech from the Dock is especially remembered for his closing remarks. Historian Patrick Geoghehan has identified over seventy different versions of the text, but in an early printing (1818) based on notes taken by Burrowes, Emmet concludes:\nI am here ready to die. I am not allowed to vindicate my character; no man shall dare to vindicate my character; and when I am prevented from vindicating myself, let no man dare to calumniate me. Let my character and my motives repose in obscurity and peace, till other times and other men can do them justice. Then shall my character be vindicated; then may my epitaph be written.Chief Justice Lord Norbury sentenced Emmet to be hanged, drawn and quartered, as was customary for conviction of treason.  The following day, 20 September, Emmet was executed in Thomas Street in front of St. Catherine's. He was hanged and then beheaded once dead. As family members and friends of Robert had also been arrested, including some who had nothing to do with the rebellion, no one came forward to claim his remains out of fear of arrest.\nOn the eve of his execution, Emmet wrote from Kilmainham to the Chief Secretary for Ireland, William Wickham, whose \"fairness\" he acknowledged. He appears to have made a profound impression.In December Wickham resigned his post, confessing to friends that \"no consideration upon earth\" could induce him \"to remain after having maturely reflected\" on the contents of the note he had received. He could not enforce laws \"unjust, oppressive and unchristian\" and intolerable to the memory of a man he had been \"compelled by the duty of my office to pursue to the death\". Wickham was persuaded that Emmet had been attempting to save Ireland from \"a state of depression and humiliation\" and that, had he himself been an Irishman, he \"should most unquestionably have joined him\"."

        "content": "Emmet's remains were first delivered to Newgate Prison and then back to Kilmainham Gaol, where the jailer was under instructions that if no one claimed them they were to be buried in a nearby hospital's burial grounds called Bully's Acre. Family tradition has it that in 1804, under cover of the burial of his sister, Mary Anne Holmes, Emmet's remains were removed from Bully's Acre and re-interred in the family vault (since demolished) at St Peter's Church in Aungier Street.After searching for Emmet's grave in Dublin, early in 1812, Percy Bysshe Shelley revised his elegiac poem \u201cThe Monarch's Funeral: An Anticipation\u201d: \"For who was he, the uncoffined slain, /That fell in Erin's injured isle /Because his spirit dared disdain/ To light his country's funeral pile?\"  In \"On Robert Emmet's Grave\" Shelley proposed that, because unknown, Emmet's grave would \"remain unpolluted by fame /Till thy foes, by the world and by fortune caressed, /Shall pass like a mist from the light of thy name.\"When Shelley returned to London from Dublin in 1812, it was with an account of Emmet's trial containing his famous speech, and Emmet appears again as the \u201cpatriot\u201d in The Devil's Walk, a lengthy broadside against a corrupt and un-reforming government. (At the same time, while in Dublin, Shelley had gone round streets and pubs of the city handing out An Address, to the Irish People, a 22-page pamphlet in which he pleaded with the Irish people not to repeat Emmet's attempt:  \"I do not wish to see things changed now, because it cannot be done without violence, and we may assure ourselves that none of us are fit for any change, however good, if we condescend to employ force in a cause we think right\")."

        "content": "Emmet\u2019s rebellion infuriated Lord Castlereagh because he \"could not see the change that his own great measure the Union has effected in Ireland\".  Despite having so badly misfired, the 1803 rising suggested that the Act of Union was not going to be the palliative Castlereagh and Prime Minister William Pitt had intended. Castlereagh advised that \"the best thing would be to go into no detail whatever upon the case, to keep the subject clearly standing on its own narrow base of a contemptible insurrection without means or respectable leaders\", an instruction Plunket appears to have followed in Emmet's prosecution. This was to be a stance taken not only by unionists.\nDaniel O'Connell who was to lead the struggle for Catholic Emancipation and for repeal of the Union in the decades following Emmet's death, roundly condemned the resort to \"physical force\".  O'Connell's own programme of mobilising public opinion, fuelled by sometimes violent rhetoric and demonstrated in \"monster meetings\",  might have suggested that constitutionalism and physical force were complementary rather than antithetical. But O'Connell remained content with his dismissal of Emmet in 1803 as an instigator of bloodshed who had forfeited any claim to \"compassion\".Emmet's political rehabilitation begins in the Famine-years of the 1840s with the Young Irelanders. In 1846 they had finally broken with O'Connell declaring that if Repeal could not be carried by moral persuasion and peaceful means, a resort to arms would be \"a no less honourable course\". The Young Irelander publisher Charles Gavan Duffy repeatedly reprinted Michael James Whitty's popular chapbook Life, Trial and Conversations of Robert Emmet Esq. (1836), and promoted R.R. Madden's Life and Times of Robert Emmet (1847) which, despite its devastating account of the Thomas Street fiasco, was hagiographic.In carrying forward the tradition of physical-force republicanism from the debacle of the Young Irelander \"Famine Rebellion\" in 1848, the Irish Republican Brotherhood (the Fenians) also carried forward admiration for Emmet. On the $20 bonds they issued in 1866 in the United States in the name of the Irish Republic, his profile appears opposite that of Tone.Robert Emmet's older brother, Thomas Addis Emmet emigrated to the United States shortly after Robert's execution. He eventually served as the New York State Attorney General. His descendants (who included the prominent American portrait painters Lydia Field Emmet, Rosina Emmet Sherwood, Ellen Emmet Rand, and Jane Emmet de Glehn) helped advance his standing among the Irish diaspora, which in turn may have been one factor in ensuring that he was one among the \"ghosts\" invoked in the run-up to 1916 Easter Rising.In the Emmet Commemoration speech he delivered in New York City in March 1914, Pearse described how the spirit of Irish patriotism called in Emmet \"to a dreamer\" and  \"awoke a man of action\"; called to \"a student and a recluse\" and brought forth \"a leader of men\"; \"called to one who loved the ways of peace\" and found \"a revolutionary\". Emmet was a man unwilling to \"surrender of one jot or shred of our claim to freedom even in return for all the blessings of the British peace\"."

        "content": "In a speech on Emmet in New York City in 1904, W. B. Yeats famously observed that \"Emmet died and became an image\". This was the work first, and foremost, of Thomas Moore. In his popular ballad \"O! Breathe Not His Name\", Moore made his former Trinity College friend the touchstone of national sentiment: \"Oh breathe not his name! let it sleep in the shade, / Where cold and unhonoured his relics are laid! [...] / And the tear we shed, though secret it rolls, Shall keep his memory green in our souls\". Dwelling upon the heartache of Sarah Curran, his \"She is Far From the Land Where Her Young Hero Sleeps\" also made Emmet an icon of romantic love.In Irish America where, together with Emmet's Speech from the Dock, \"O! Breathe Not His Name\" became part of the canon of parochial education, Moore had innumerable imitators. Of these, one of the most ambitious was John Boyle O'Reilly, a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood who had escaped from penal servitude in Western Australia. O'Reilly wrote a publicly performed eighty-four line poem, \"The Patriot's Grave\" (1878) in which he both echoes the defiance of Emmet's last words while attempting to bring the defence of physical force within a broader tradition that embraced constitutional agitation (to add Emmet to a Pantheon that included \"Grattan, Flood and Curran\"). Emmet was also a frequent character on the patriotic stage. Typical of his green-uniform presentation was Brandon Tynon's melodrama, Robert Emmet, the Days of 1803, which premiered on Broadway in 1902.In the nineteenth century, the Emmet story also found its way into prose. On both sides of the Atlantic John Doherty's 1836 Life, Trial and Conversation and Times of Robert Emmet, and R. R. Madden's 1844 Life and Time of Robert Emmet became the standard references. With less patience for historical or political background, what tended to be drawn out in subsequent works was the notion of  \"pure sacrifice\". In Robert Emmet, A Survey of his Rebellion and of His Romance (1904), Louise Imogen Guiney classes Emmet with Charlotte Corday and John Brown.In the early twentieth century, Moore's Emmet appeared in pioneering film. While focussed on the Emmet-Curran love story, the 1911Thanhouser film (USA) Robert Emmet depicts Emmet's expulsion from Trinity College, his meeting with Napoleon, his part in the rising and his capture, trial and execution. Some of the same storyline features in Ireland a Nation (1914) written and produced in London and Ireland by Walter MacNamara, and Sidney Olcott's  Bold Emmett Ireland's Martyr (1915, Sid Films, USA).Many decades later there was a step away from hagiography. In her screen drama Anne Devlin (1984), the Irish feminist filmmaker Pat Murphy offers an implicit criticism of patriotic politics that operates \"largely at the level of signs and representations\". In one scene, Emmet enters a room as Devlin is holding up his splendid green uniform in front of a mirror. Asked what she thinks of it, Devlin (cousin of the guerrilla leader Michael Dwyer) replies that it looks like a green version of an English Redcoat, and will be seen \"a mile off\". \"We should\", she argues, \"be rebel as ourselves\u2019\".Emmet is \"bold Robert\" in the song Back Home in Derry, written by Bobby Sands in HM Prison Maze before his fatal hunger strike in 1981. The lyrics, describing the feelings of rebels convicts as leave Ireland for Australia, were recorded by Christy Moore."

Focht was philosopher of phenomenological orientation, who in the early works departed from the Marxist and psychological interpretations of art. Music is in his texts had ontological priority over all other arts. In the art of music, particularly that of Bach, Focht tried to uncover the importance of achieving pythagorean music. Bach's music, as interpreted by Focht, is not a mere reflection of the subject, nor a reflection of social reality, just as it is not an expression of human feelings, but the secret of life organized and tuned to the cosmic laws.Focht, beside the aesthetics, has published several important books about mushrooms. He was also one of the first thinkers and critics of science fiction in Croatia, considering that our age is the time of death of philosophy, or age of science and science fiction. Focht died in Zagreb on October 20, 1992, and was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery."

While she primarily writes in Spanish, she is fluent in English, German, and French, having worked as a translator for several years. She has traveled extensively and lived in various Central American countries and Europe. The pluralities of these cultural and geographical fusions manifest themselves in her literary production and intellectual thought. Her novel, A-B-Sudario (Alfaguara, 2003), was awarded the Mario Monteforte Toledo Central American Prize for Fiction (Premio Centroamericano de Novela Mario Monteforte Toledo). She has also received residencies by La Maison des \u00c9crivains \u00c9trangers et des Traducteurs in Saint-Nazaire, France and Heinrich B\u00f6ll Haus in Langenbroich, Germany.\nAlthough a prolific author with many publications, the majority of Escudos's work remains unpublished. Despite the often limited means of literary circulation in Central America, some of Escudos's unpublished work has nonetheless been recognized. In 2002, for instance, Escudos won a national contest in El Salvador, the Tenth Annual Literary Contest of Ahuachap\u00e1n (D\u00e9cimos Juegos Florales de Ahuachap\u00e1n) for her book, Cr\u00f3nicas para sentimentales.\nEscudos's narrative voice engages with experimental forms and techniques. This experimentation is intentional, one that structures and situates her work through the opening of possibilities in relationship to selfhood and space. This narrative voice and its relationship to other literary maps is demonstrated in Escudos's current participation in the blogosphere. Her official blog, Jacintario, is a regularly updated medium\u2013\u2013an extension of Escudos's writing that operates as a daily form of expression where the author's voice, and content, varies. As an online cultural magazine, Jacintario contributes to the blogosphere not simply because it is a production by an eminent literary figure, but because of the immediacy and access the blog offers in relationship to a genre in the making."

After a good spell \u2013 he started in all the Primeira Liga games during the season, completing all but one \u2013 the move was made permanent, but he was deemed surplus to requirements shortly after, which prompted a new January move, also in the country, as he joined (on loan) U.D. Leiria.\nSmit returned to his country in the 2008 summer, signing with top-level side FC Volendam. After having appeared sparingly throughout the campaign, he dropped down a category and returned to his first professional club, Telstar, retiring from professional football in July 2011 at the age of 30."

When he was young, he won the newcomer's prize in the Cosqu\u00edn Festival.Many of his songs address what he sees as the social problems in Latin American and various human rights issues. In 1972 the singer turned into the first Argentine entrant in the first edition of the OTI Festival which was held in Madrid.

At an early age he wrote a book on the Origin of Acadians, a history that contradicted myths of the time. He also wrote multiple articles and a glossary of the Acadian French language. After finishing school at the College Saint-Joseph in Memramcook during 1872, Poirier was appointed Postmaster of the Dominion Parliament at age 20.  He held that position until he was appointed to the Senate thirteen years later.Poirier was the first Acadian appointed to the Senate of Canada. He was appointed in 1885 and served for 48 years, 6 months, and 17 days until his death in 1933. As the Constitution of Canada requires new senators to be at least 30 years old and (since 1965) to leave the Senate when they reach 75, Poirier's record can never be exceeded unless the constitution is amended again to allow it.\nThe Pascal Poirier House (built c. 1820\u201330) was designated a Provincial Historic Site under the Historic Sites Protection Act.  The home he was born in has been preserved as a museum and as an important and rare example of early-19th-century Acadian residential construction.  The 1+1\u20442-storey gabled house, which features a hand-hewn structure, is believed to be the oldest building in Shediac.\nHe was honored as a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur by France in 1902."

        "content": "Rachel Stainer was born in Islington. After her father Tom died in World War I, the family moved to Newbury, Berkshire.\nAfter an \"impulsive and unsuccessful wartime liaison\", in 1947 she moved to Vienna to work with the Four Power Commission, and married the journalist Antony Terry. Terry was German correspondent for the Sunday Times, and the marriage \"fell victim to his workload\".Stainer never returned to England, living in Berlin, Bonn and Trieste before returning to Vienna. In 1956 Cyril Ray helped secure her a job as Central and Eastern Europe Correspondent for The Spectator, making a plea that she needed the money. Writing as Sarah Gainham (the name of her maternal great-grandmother), she reported on Germany and the German-speaking parts of Central Europe until 1966. She soon published her first novel, Time Right Deadly (1956), a semi-autobiographical account of an unsuccessful affair. The novel was followed by several other spy thrillers set in Europe. Here Gainham drew on her own knowledge of Cold War spies and intrigues: Terry, hired to the Sunday Times by Ian Fleming, may have been an MI6 agent, and Gainham herself apparently researched a document 'East-West Routes for Agents', commissioned by Fleming, on how to gain access to West Berlin from East Berlin.In 1964 her marriage to Terry was dissolved, and she married Kenneth Ames, Central European correspondent of The Economist. Night Falls on the City (1967), a tale of love and betrayal set in wartime Vienna, achieved significant commercial success: it topped the New York Times bestseller list for several months, and was widely translated. It was the first novel of a trilogy, completed by A Place in the Country (1969) and Private Worlds (1971), and gave her financial security.In 1975 Ames committed suicide, leaving Gainham alone in later life. In 1976 she moved from Vienna to a small house in Petronell-Carnuntum, on the banks of the Danube, and became a somewhat eccentric recluse. Her last novel was the heavily autobiographical but unsuccessful The Tiger, Life (1983). In 1984 she was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. A Discursive Essay on the Presentation of Recent History in England was privately published in 1999."

He later lived in Rome (1957\u201368), returning to Princeton to earn a PhD in 1970.  He subsequently held faculty appointments at Indiana University (1970\u201392) and the University of Chicago (1989\u201399).Eaton was a prominent composer of microtonal music, and worked with Paul Ketoff and Robert Moog during the 1960s in developing several types of synthesizer.  Notably, he was involved in the development, use, and ultimately unsuccessful commercialization of the SynKet.  He devised a compositional genre called pocket opera, operas scored for a small cast of vocalists and a chamber group, and composed such pocket opera works as Peer Gynt, Let's Get This Show on the Road, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.His operas include The Cry of Clytaemnestra (1980), a re-telling of some of the events surrounding the Trojan War from the perspective of Agamemnon's wife Clytaemnestra, which has been hailed as the first feminist opera. It was premi\u00e8red in Bloomington, at the Indiana University Opera Theater, on March 1, 1980, and received a number of subsequent productions, most notably in New York and California.  Eaton's opera, The Tempest, with a libretto by Andrew Porter after William Shakespeare, was premi\u00e8red at the Santa Fe Opera on July 27, 1985, and subsequently performed in the autumn of 1986 at the Indiana University School of Music.During his tenure at the University of Chicago, Eaton concentrated on works for smaller ensembles, including chamber operas that involved dramatic participation of the instrumentalists alongside the singers.  He founded and directed The Pocket Opera Players, a professional troupe dedicated to the performance of his works in this genre, and occasionally those of fellow composers interested in the form. He continued to lead the Pocket Opera Players in New York City, after his retirement from Chicago in 2001.  He was a recipient of the Prix de Rome, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and a MacArthur Fellowship.Eaton died on December 2, 2015, following a brain hemorrhage. His wife Nelda Nelson-Eaton and two children, Estela and Julian, survive him."

His first formal training was with the Cremonese painter Cesare Baglioni (no evident relation to Giovanni Baglione). He apparently quickly worked independently then rejoined his friend and fellow Bolognese and Baglione pupil, Lionello Spada. Together during the early 17th century, they began to collaborate in quadratura, with Curti painting the structures, while Spada painted the figures. They soon parted, with Spada becoming a canvas painter, and Curti was to travel to paint in Modena, Parma (1618 and 1630), Rome (1623) and Genoa. He returned from Rome to Bologna, and there was assisted by Michelangelo Colonna, Agostino Mitelli, and Andrea Seghizzi, and painted architectural backgrounds for Guercino frescoes. Much of his work has been lost over the centuries.\nThe main source of his biography is Cesare Malvasia, whose father's villa at Trebbio was frescoed by Curti and assistants."

Her parents were wealthy Jewish people with college degrees, and the prestige certainly carried over to Tesoro who began third grade at the early age of six. Tesoro graduated from Liceo Classico Marco Polo high school in 1938 shortly after her father passed away in 1934. Unfortunately, she was denied entrance into any Italian school due to her Jewish identity as the nation\u2019s fascist ideas forbade Jews from attending higher education. That did not stop Tesoro, who traveled to Geneva, Switzerland to obtain an x-ray technician diploma, and eventually to the United States to further her studies in chemistry. Her passion led her to attempt to enter the PhD program at Yale University, as a teenager. Tesoro self-studied the course material for months before successfully passing several examinations and completing some senior-level courses, both of which were expedited due to the second World War occurring at the time. At the age of 21, Giuliana had obtained a PhD in organic chemistry. A year later, she married a newswriter named Victor Tesoro who was working at Yale during her studies, in the heart of New York City. Four years later, Tesoro officially became a U.S. citizen.\nOver the rest of her life, Tesoro moved up the ranks at various corporations and educational institutions, pursuing her love of the basic science of chemistry. She started working as a research chemist at Calco Chemical Company, then moving to Onyx Oil and Chemical Company under the same title. During her time at Onyx, she rose from the head of the organic synthesis department in 1946 to the associate director in 1955. Next, Tesoro served as assistant director of organic research over a roughly ten-year tenure before moving to the Textile Research Institute for two years. In 1969, she accepted a position as senior chemist at Burlington Industries and was appointed director of chemical research in 1971, where she was a prolific inventor, having been granted more than two dozen patents in 1970, alone. She then taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1972 to 1976 as a visiting professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, moving on to a role as adjunct professor and senior research scientist. Tesoro then ventured back to New York City as she was appointed research professor of polymer chemistry at Polytechnic University (now the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, as of 2015) in Brooklyn, New York, from 1982 until her retirement in 1996. Tesoro lectured often on polymers at conferences worldwide while at Polytechnic University. On the side, she served as an editor for the Textile Research Journal.  \nGiuliana Tesoro died on September 29, 2002, in Dobbs Ferry, New York, at the age of 81."

Among her contributions were a better conceptualization of fiber chemical modification, permanent press properties, cross-linking agents, pharmaceutical synthesis, and most notably created flame-resistant fibers.\nFlame-resistant fabrics\nInspiration for such fibers came from wanting to prevent potential harm in certain environments such as on the roadway and uniforms. In prior times, people would wear clothing from natural material like cotton, which is highly flammable, and not suited for high-risk situations like firefighter emergencies, or simply a car\u2019s tires running along a roadway creating friction rapidly.

According to Home, the alliance was an occult order with himself as the magus and only member. The manifesto called for \"debasement in the arts\" and in a parodic manner plagiarized a 1930s British fascist pamphlet on cultural politics. Alliance activities mainly consisted of the publication of a newsletter \"Re-action\" which appeared in ten issues.In 1993, the Neoist Alliance staged a prank against a concert by composer Karlheinz Stockhausen in Brighton by announcing its intention to levitate the concert hall by magical means during the concert. This was an homage to the 1965 anti-art picketing of a Stockhausen concert in New York by Fluxus members Henry Flynt and George Maciunas.\nAlliance activities ran parallel and were closely related to those of the revived London Psychogeographical Association and the Italian-based Luther Blissett project.Despite its name, the Neoist Alliance had no affiliation with the international Neoist network which had been active since 1980. Stewart Home had previously become a member and activist of that network in 1984, but renounced it one year later and subsequently worked under the collective monikers of \"Praxis\", later \"plagiarism\" and the Art Strike movement."

The name \"Memphis\", which the rapper explained paid homage to pimps, was a backronym for \"Making Easy Money, Pimping Hoes In Style\" and \"Bleek\" was a childhood nickname stemming from his younger sister trying to pronounce his first name, Malik. Bleek's first official appearance was on \"Coming of Age\" from Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt (1996), followed by an appearance on \"Can I Live II\", released on the reissued version of the album.

Bleek launched his own label, Get Low Records in 1998.\nThereafter, he released three follow-up albums for the label: The Understanding (2000), M.A.D.E. (2003), and 534 (2005). Coming of Age and The Understanding were both certified gold by the RIAA. In between the release of The Understanding and M.A.D.E., he took a three-year hiatus, in which he took care of his older brother, who was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. 534 was named after the building number of the housing project in which he and Jay-Z grew up, and became the first release from the \"new\" Roc-A-Fella, referring to Jay-Z becoming the president of Def Jam Recordings prior to its release. A song from the album, titled \"Dear Summer\", is performed solely by Jay-Z and refers to what he called the time of the year in which he would drop a classic album or single consecutively for eight years, and how he had to metaphorically leave \"her\" (Summer). \"Dear Summer\" would mark Jay-Z's first song since beginning his brief \"retirement\" in late 2003. 534 also contains one of the first recordings by Def Jam labelmate turned international star, Rihanna, who featured on the song \"The One\".Memphis Bleek's highest charting single was \"Is That Yo Chick\", featuring Missy Elliott and Jay-Z, which peaked at number 7 on the Hot Rap Singles Billboard chart and number 68 on the Billboard Hot 100. Other charting singles include \"It's Alright\", which also featured Jay-Z and peaked at number 61.In fall 2005, Memphis Bleek told MTV that he was recording an album called The Process, that he would describe as a make or break album, saying \"I want to do an album that's through the roof, I want to do a classic album. I feel that if this album I'm not recording is a classic, I'm not even gonna put it out. I have to do it bigger than anybody has ever done it. I have to make a good record this time, not just talking-junk records.\" The rapper has worked on the album since 2005, and during that time frame he would release the promotional singles: \"Hustla\", \"Get Ya Money Off\" and \"Let It Off\". As of 2024, the album has yet to be released. Memphis Bleek would eventually leave Roc-A-Fella in 2009, after Jay-Z told him he could run his own company and had the proper distribution deals to do so. That same year, Bleek signed a new deal with Mass Appeal Entertainment.In the summer of 2010, he served as a hype man for Jay-Z on stage during a performance at the Swedish festival Peace&Love.\nOn April 10, 2012, Memphis Bleek released The Movement, an online mixtape which went on to receive over 125,000 downloads on DatPiff. On June 6, 2012, Memphis Bleek released Kush Vol. 2. On March 21, 2014, he released The Movement 2 as a mixtape for free download."

Hahn also forged a formidable doubles partnership, and won many titles, with his long-time team-mate, David Harse (\"Harry\"). Hahn had a fine all-round game and could defend away from the table with the best of them.  However, he was probably happiest when deploying his imaginatively varied, unerringly consistent and pitilessly accurate loops to put his opponents on the defensive.  As well as his dominating forehand loop, he was among the first practitioners of the backhand loop, probably the hardest shot in the game.  His matchless powers of concentration meant that, although his style demanded the greatest precision, he seldom missed.\nThough his competitive drive sometimes spilled over into unnerving displays of fury, he played the game fairly and he encouraged many youngsters, who found him to be an approachable and inspiring champion of the game.\nHe died in Oxford, Oxfordshire on 28 January 1991."

He had his feature film debut in the 1985 film Compromising Positions, starring Susan Sarandon, and in 1986 had his first recurring role on television on the HBO situation comedy series 1st & Ten. He starred alongside O. J. Simpson and Sam J. Jones in HBO's sequel to 1st & Ten titled Training Camp: The Bulls Are Back, and John Voorhees of The Seattle Times wrote: \"The cast, which includes O.J. Simpson, Sam Jones and newcomer Jason Beghe, is first-rate.\"In 1988, he starred in the film Monkey Shines: An Experiment In Fear, directed by George A. Romero. He portrayed Allan Mann, a law student made quadriplegic when hit by a truck in the opening credits of the film. The Philadelphia Inquirer gave a positive review of Beghe's performance in Monkey Shines: \"Acting only with his face and voice, Jason Beghe is terrific at conveying the mounting anger and rage of an active man made passive\". David Foil of The Advocate described Beghe's performance as \"remarkable simply for meeting the demands of the character\".Beghe played an ice hockey star in the Perry Mason TV film The Case of the All-Star Assassin, an NBC-TV telefeature broadcast November 19, 1989. In 1991, he played a State Trooper in the film Thelma & Louise (reuniting him with Sarandon, with whom he'd appeared in Compromising Positions), and was Demi Moore's love interest in the 1997 film G.I. Jane. He had recurring roles on Picket Fences and Melrose Place, and became a cast member of Chicago Hope in 1997, portraying electrician Danny Blaines opposite romantic interest Dr. Austin played by Christine Lahti. In a 1997 interview in The Boston Herald, Beghe spoke about his respect for his fellow cast members in Chicago Hope: \"I think it's the best cast assembled that I've ever seen. One for one, they're incredible. And to work with Christine Lahti? I'd drop a lot of things for that. She's so good and smart and dedicated. I've become a better actor just for working with her.\" He commented on his character on Melrose Place, a closeted military officer who had feelings for Matt, played by Doug Savant: \"I thought we should kiss, but it was too much. TV is a very specific medium, and you're naive if you think that everything is just based on artistic decisions. If it prevents them from selling some products, that's a major consideration. But I'm an actor. I'll do whatever it takes.\" In 1993, Beghe played Lt. Pat Rudledge in the television drama series Matlock.\nBeghe co-starred with Moira Kelly in the 1998 CBS television drama series To Have & to Hold, where he played police officer Sean McGrail. Mike Duffy of the Detroit Free Press wrote: \"There is an affectionate romantic sizzle between the ruggedly handsome Beghe (\"G.I. Jane\") and the dark-haired, unconventionally attractive Kelly (\"Little Odessa\").\" Kinney Littlefield of the Orange County Register said that \"Beghe and Kelly have charm.\"Beghe appeared in acting roles on Numb3rs, CSI: NY, Everwood, Criminal Minds, Veronica Mars, \"Jag\" and Cane. Beghe portrayed exorcist Ray Purvis in the 2008 horror film One Missed Call. In 2009, Beghe had a guest-starring role on the television show Californication. He played the character novelist Richard Bates, a friend of character Hank Moody (played by David Duchovny). \"Bates, played by Jason Beghe, made for an interesting character and the fact that he didn't get as much screen time as some of the other characters is a shame,\" wrote Danny Gallagher of TV Squad. In October 2009, Beghe was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for the filming of the film The Next Three Days, directed by Paul Haggis. The film was released in 2010 and starred Elizabeth Banks, Russell Crowe, Brian Dennehy, and Olivia Wilde.Since 2014, Beghe has starred on Chicago P.D.; the show is a spin-off of Chicago Fire, on which Beghe played a recurring role. Chicago P.D. follows the detectives of the Chicago Police Department's Intelligence Unit that combats the city's major offenses, including organized crime, drug trafficking, and high-profile murders. Beghe plays the role of Sgt. Hank Voight, a \"tough cop\" who heads the Intelligence Unit. On November 21, 2017, Deadline Hollywood reported that Beghe was investigated for behavior that was considered overly aggressive and possibly sexual harassment while filming Chicago P.D. in 2016. Claims of inappropriate behavior were reportedly made by his former co-star, Sophia Bush. Beghe released a statement in which he acknowledged having anger problems, stated that he was working on them, admitted to engaging in aggressive behavior on set, and apologized."

        "content": "Jean Espariat was born on 17 September 1747 in Aix-en-Provence. His father, Charles Espariat, was a silversmith and later a lawyer in the Parlement of Aix-en-Provence.\nAfter the Ancien R\u00e9gime came to an end and the Parlement of Aix-en-Provence was dismantled by the French Revolution, Espariat was elected as first Mayor of Aix-en-Provence on 10 February 1790. However, the early days were still chaotic. He was a moderate. Indeed, on the Cours Saint-Louis in Aix, he stopped the Vexin regiment, a pro-revolutionary regiment, and the Royal Marine regiment, a pro-aristocratic regiment, from killing each other.He stepped down on 11 November 1790 and let the Vice Mayor, Toussaint-Bernard \u00c9meric-David, serve as Mayor. During that time, lawyer Jean-Joseph-Pierre Pascalis (1732-1790), a royalist, was killed during the riots of December 1790 in Aix-en-Provence. Meanwhile, together with Antoine Balthazar Joachim, baron d'Andr\u00e9 (1759 -1825) and an abbey from Quinson, he helped establish the department of the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne.\nHe served as a member of the Legislative Assembly from September 1791 to 1792, when he condemned the revolutionary crimes in Avignon. He also returned as Mayor of Aix on 1 September 1791 until 20 September 1792. He was jailed during the Reign of Terror of 1793\u20131794. During the French Directory of 1795 to 1799, he served as an administrator of the department of the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne he had helped create. During the French Consulate of 1799\u20131804, he served as a magistrate in the Criminal Court of the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne.\nHe received the Knighthood of the Legion of Honour for his public service.\nHe died on 14 January 1827 in Aix-en-Provence.\n\n\n== References =="

Some of Kannemeyer's works deal with the issues of race relations and colonialism, by appropriating the style of Herg\u00e9\u2019s comics, namely from Tintin in the Congo. In \"Pappa in Afrika\", Tintin becomes a white African, depicted either as a white liberal or as a racist white imperialist in Africa. In this stereotyped satire, the whites are superior, literate and civilised, and the blacks are savage and dumb. In \"Peekaboo\", a large acrylic work, the white African is jumping up in alarm as a black man figure pokes his head out of the jungle shouting an innocuous 'peekaboo!' A cartoon called \"The Liberals\" has been interpreted as an attack on white fear, bigotry and political correctness: a group of anonymous black people (who look like golliwogs) are about to rape a white lady, who calls her attackers \"historically disadvantaged men\"."

He freely translated works from German, Turkish, Persian, Arabic, and Irish, with his translations of Goethe gaining special interest. Starting around 1840, and with increasing frequency after the Great Famine began, he wrote patriotic poems, such as A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century. Mangan was troubled, eccentric, and an alcoholic. He died early from cholera, amid the continuing dire conditions of the Famine. After his death, Mangan was hailed as Ireland's first national poet and admired by writers such as James Joyce and William Butler Yeats."

After marrying Smith, James Mangan took over a grocery business in Dublin owned by the Smith family, eventually becoming bankrupt as a result. \nMangan described his father as having \"a princely soul but no prudence\", and attributed his family's bankruptcy to his father's suspect business speculations and tendency to throw expensive parties. Thanks to poor record keeping, inconsistent biographies, and his own semi-fictional and sensationalized autobiographical accounts, Mangan's early years are the subject of much speculation. However, despite the popular image of Mangan as a long-suffering, poor poet, there is reason to believe that his early years were spent in relative middle-class comfort.He was educated at a Jesuit school where he learned Latin, Spanish, French, and Italian. He attended three schools before the age of fifteen. Obliged to find a job in order to support his family, for seven years he was a scrivener's clerk and for three years earned meagre wages in an attorney's office, and was later an employee of the Ordnance Survey and an assistant in the library of Trinity College, Dublin."

In 1830 he began producing translations \u2013 generally free interpretations rather than strict transliterations \u2013 from German, a language he had taught himself. Of interest are his translations of Goethe. From 1834 his contributions began appearing in the Dublin University Magazine. In 1840 he began producing translations from Turkish poetry, Persian poetry, Arabic poetry, and Irish poetry. He was also known for literary hoaxes; some of his \"translations\" are in fact works of his own, like Twenty Golden Years Ago, attributed to a certain Selber. His connection with The Dublin University Magazine was terminated because his habits rendered him incapable of regular application.\nHe was friends with the patriotic journalists Thomas Davis, and John Mitchel, who would write his biography. His poems were published in their newspaper The Nation. Mangan was for a time paid a fixed salary, but, as on former occasions, these relations were broken off, though he continued to send verses to \"The Nation\" even after he had cast in his lot with Mitchel, who in 1848 began to issue The United Irishman.Although his early poetry was often apolitical, after the Famine he began writing patriotic poems, including influential works such as Dark Rosaleen, a translation of R\u00f3is\u00edn Dubh and A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century. \n\nHis best-known poems include Dark Rosaleen, Siberia, Nameless One, A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century, The Funerals, To the Ruins of Donegal Castle, Pleasant Prospects for the Land-eaters and Woman of Three Cows. He wrote a brief autobiography, on the advice of his friend Charles Patrick Meehan, which ends mid-sentence. This must have been written in the last months of his life, since he mentions his narrative poem of the Italian Gasparo Bandollo, which was published in the Dublin University Magazine in May 1849.\nMangan was a lonely and often difficult man who suffered from mood swings, depression and irrational fears, and became a heavy drinker and opium user. There are many descriptions of his personal appearance at this time, all of them dwelling on his spare figure, his tight blue cloak, his witch's hat, and his inevitable umbrella. He was described by the artist William Frederick Wakeman as frequently wearing \"a huge pair of green spectacles\", padded shirts to hide his malnourished figure, and a hat which \"resembled those which broomstick-riding witches are usually represented with\". In 1849, weakened by poverty, alcoholism and malnutrition, he succumbed to cholera aged only 46. He was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery."

        "content": "Mangan's poetry fits into a variety of literary traditions. Most obviously, and frequently, his work is read alongside such nationalist political authors as John Mitchel, as they appeared in The Nation, The Vindicator and the United Irishman newspapers; or as a manifestation of the 19th-century Irish Cultural Revival. It is hard not to acknowledge Mangan's debts to such translators and collectors of traditional Irish poetry as Samuel Ferguson and James Hardiman; many of Mangan's poems, for instance Dark Roseleen, appear to be adaptations of earlier translations rather than original translations.\nMangan is also frequently read as a Romantic poet. In particular, he is compared to Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas De Quincey, largely thanks to his rumoured opium addiction and tendency to place his writing within the frame of a vision or dream.\nMore recently, critics have begun to read Mangan's work as a precursor to modernist and postmodernist experimental writing. His playful literary hoaxes and fake translations (which he called \"reverse plagiarism\") have been seen as a precursor to the works of Flann O'Brien."

        "content": "During his life and immediately after, Mangan's legacy was co-opted by Irish nationalism, primarily thanks to John Mitchel's biography of Mangan, which stressed that Mangan was \"a rebel with his whole heart and soul against the whole British spirit\". Naturally, this helped to propel Mangan's legacy as Ireland's first national poet, and to lead later Irish writers to look back at his work.James Joyce wrote two essays on Mangan, the first in 1902 and the second in 1907 and also used his name in his works, for instance in Araby in Dubliners. Joyce wrote that in Mangan's poetry \"images interweave [their] soft, luminous scarves and words ring like brilliant mail, and whether the song is of Ireland or of Istambol it has the same refrain, a prayer that peace may come again to her who has lost peace, the moonwhite pearl of his soul\". Joyce also described Mangan as \"a prototype for a would-be-nation\", but stressed that he was ultimately a \"feeble figure\" that fell short of such promise.WB Yeats considered Mangan one of the best Irish poets, along with Thomas Davis and Samuel Ferguson, writing \"To the soul of Clarence Mangan was tied the burning ribbon of Genius.\"\nAmong the contemporary Irish writers he has influenced are Thomas Kinsella; Michael Smith; James McCabe, who wrote a sensationally discovered continuation of Mangan's autobiography that appeared in the Dublin journal Metre in 2001, but was later revealed \u2013 in a Mangan-style hoax \u2013 to be written by McCabe rather than Mangan; and David Wheatley, author of a sonnet sequence on Mangan. He is also cited by songwriter Shane MacGowan as an inspiration for both his work and his lifestyle. McGowan's song \"The Snake with Eyes of Garnet\" features Mangan as a character:\n\nA 1979 novel by Northern Irish/Canadian novelist Brian Moore, The Mangan Inheritance, tells the story of (fictional) young American James Mangan traveling to Ireland to find whether he is descended from the poet.\nWhile Mangan still has not acquired the critical clout of Joyce or Yeats, more recent literary criticism has begun to seriously consider his work. Largely, this can be attributed to the publication of David Lloyd's Nationalism and Minor Literature: James Clarence Mangan and the Emergence of Irish Cultural Nationalism in 1987. Lloyd's work was the first to seriously attempt to untangle Mangan the man from the nationalist poet fostered by John Mitchel.\nPrivate papers of Mangan are held in the National Library of Ireland, the Royal Irish Academy, and the archives of Trinity College, Dublin."

He was a National Party member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1986 to 1989, representing the electorate of Nerang.\nHynd was born in Sydney, the son of a coalminer. He attended Chatswood Primary School, Mosman High School and Gore Hill Technical College. He trained as a master builder, and later opened TS Hynd Pty Ltd, a business specialising in electronic doors. He was a prominent business figure on the Gold Coast, and Alex Douglas claimed that \"he installed probably half of the roller doors on houses that were built\". He was actively involved in the National Party, and had been the vice-president of its south-east zone.Hynd was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1986 state election for Nerang, a new electorate created with the enlargement of parliament that year. Hynd was an enthusiastic supporter of Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and endorsed his Joh for Canberra campaign, having been quoted in 1987 as stating: \"It would be the greatest thing ever to happen to Australia if Joh was to be Prime Minister . . . He is just the man to lead this country out of the wilderness. I would walk from here to George Street for Joh to be PM.\" One issue which Hynd took up in parliament with lasting effect was the cause of those living in caravan parks, as he first issued a green paper outlining issues in the area, and then successfully introduced legislation to protect their rights.  He was promoted to Deputy Government Whip in September 1989, two months before the 1989 state election. He was defeated at that election by Liberal candidate Ray Connor, and did not run for office again.In retirement, he was actively involved in the Rotary Club, and made wooden toys and sold them at markets in order to raise money for charity. He died on the Gold Coast on 20 October 2011.\n\n\n== References =="

He moved to the United States in 1947 and attended Oberlin College where he directed productions for the Oberlin Mummers. He graduated in 1951 with a degree in art history. Three years later he received a Master of Fine Arts Degree in theater direction from the Yale Drama School. In 1955, he joined the faculty of Yale's undergraduate theater studies department and also taught in the graduate Drama School, where he remained until his death from colon cancer at age 60. \nPsacharopoulos was a co-founder of the Williamstown Theater Festival (WTF) in 1955, based in the Adams Memorial Theater on the campus of Williams College. Psacharopoulos went on to serve as WTF's sole artistic executive director for 33 years, creating a professional summer theater that was more than a typical summer stock escapist operation. He was aided for many years by Tom Brennan, who served as the WTF associate director. Under Psacharopoulos' leadership, WTF specialized in the plays of Anton Chekhov and Bertolt Brecht, as well as the work of many classic American playwrights such as Tennessee Williams, Thornton Wilder, Arthur Miller, and Archibald MacLeish. Psacharopoulos traveled often between his Greek homeland and New York City, his main residence, where he staged theater productions with the Circle-in-the-Square, the New York Pro Musica, and City Opera.Many directors and leaders of American theater were inspired by Nikos' guidance. Each year he would choose an assistant from his students at Yale or Circle in the Square NYC, to accompany him to WTF to experience their first seasons as professional directors."

        "content": "Born to a family of sailors, Lejoille started sailing at seven as a boy on the merchantman commanded by his father. He then studied at Abbeville and Amiens before embarking as a helmsman on the fluyt Tamponne in 1776. In 1780, he joined the crew of the Degranbourg, a merchantman chartered by the Crown in Suffren's fleet, on which he took part in the Battle of Porto Praya. At the arrival at the Cape of Good Hope, Lejoille took command of Degranbourg while his father returned to France.In 1783, Lejoille returned to the merchant navy. On 6 May 1793, he was appointed Lieutenant and given command of the 14-gun corvette C\u00e9leste, which he ferried to Toulon. On 14, an incident occurred between C\u00e9leste and the Danish brig Franc-Navire, under Captain Elepsem, that triggered an investigation by the National Convention. Hennequin states that while crossing, C\u00e9leste captured the British war-brig Shout, of 18 guns.Arrived in Toulon, Lejoille was appointed to the Tonnant as first officer. He distinguished himself during the action of 8 June 1794 where the frigate Alceste was captured, and transferred on Alceste as her new captain. In 1795, he took part in the squadron under Admiral Martin, and was the first ship to overhaul and engage the 74-gun HMS Berwick at the action of 8 March 1795 where she was captured. A shot from Alceste having decapitated Berwick 's captain Adam Littlejohn, Lejoille was credited with much of the merit of the capture, and granted command of the prize. However, severely wounded at the right arm and leg, he was transferred to the flagship and convalesced in Genoa for eight months.Promoted to Chef de Division during his convalescence, Lejoille was first sent to Venice to oversee commissionings of the ships captured in the harbour, and then transferred to Corfu to take command of the 74-gun G\u00e9n\u00e9reux, in Brueys' squadron. He took part in the Battle of the Nile at the rear of the French line, duelling with HMS Bellerophon. His men inflicted heavy damage on the Bellerophon, but were damaged themselves in turn and eventually fled from the battlefield.\nAfter the Battle of the Nile, G\u00e9n\u00e9reux sailed to Corfu with Guillaume Tell and the frigate Diane and Justice, which he lost en route. Near Crete, G\u00e9n\u00e9reux met with HMS Leander, which she captured in the action of 18 August 1798. The British officers were released on parole.British sources later accused the French crew and Lejoille himself of plunder and various war crimes; the French captain who ferried the paroled officers of Leander to Trieste attacked the charges, and in his  Batailles navales de la France, Troude accuses William James of further \"augmenting\" the accusations originally published in the Gazette de Vienne. L\u00e9on Gu\u00e9rin claims that the accusations stem entirely from the Life of Nelson and that it furthermore fabricated a report by Lejoille.During the Siege of Corfu, Lejoille led G\u00e9n\u00e9reux to assist General Chabot and to harass the Russian blockade. As the situation of Corfu became more critical, Lejoille decided to organise a relief operation: he sailed to Ancona with G\u00e9n\u00e9reux and the brig Rivoli, where he loaded a 1000-man force, along with ammunition and food. One month later, he sailed back to Corfu.Awaiting a reconnaissance of Corfu, Lejoille decided to moor his ships in Brindisi harbour. In order to do so, he intended to sail past the fort defending the entrance channel without firing and attack it from behind. However, a navigation error grounded G\u00e9n\u00e9reux under the fort, forcing Lejoille to accept a gunnery duel. Lejoille was killed in the subsequent exchange of fire.Captain Touffet replaced Lejoille, and the fort and city of Brindisi surrendered after a two-hour battle. G\u00e9n\u00e9reux was refloated and awaited news from Corfu, which had in fact fallen on 3 March 1799; when informed, she put to sail and returned to Ancona. A xebec captured near Livorno was named Lejoille in his honour in March 1799."

Marienetta grew up in Spreenhagen and last lived at Birkenweg 13, where she was nicknamed \"Micki\" by her friends, as she was a \"small, free-spirited and fun-loving person.\" One of her friends, Falko Vogt, later explained she and her friends really \"just wanted to live in peace, without any problems and without being forbidden to do anything.\"  During the school year, Marienetta had little contact with other students. Instead, during her spare time, she helped in a retirement home in the neighboring village of Gr\u00fcnheide, where she was very popular with senior citizens. In 1979, Marienetta began her apprenticeship as a textile worker at the tyre factory where her mother worked.Falko Vogt had been thinking about escaping East Germany for a long time, and when he and Marienetta met Peter Wiesner together in spring 1980, discovered that Wiesner also disliked the conditions in the country. Wiesner applied a number of times for an exit permit to leave East Germany. When Marienetta turned 18, the legal age of an adult under East German law, she became engaged to Peter Wiesner and they planned to move in together in the fall of 1980. However, this decision led to major conflicts with Marienetta's parents who were opposed to the relationship, fearing that they were going to lose their only child, particularly if she emigrated with Wiesner. Additionally, Wiesner was divorced, drank a lot, was violence prone, struggled to maintain consistent employment, and had a history of being in trouble with the police. To end the relationship, Marienetta's parents succeeded in getting a police order to ban Wiesner from having any contact with their daughter. After that, the three young people were just waiting for the right moment to leave East Germany, and planned to flee together on the night of 22 November 1980. In preparation for their escape, Peter Wiesner created a folding ladder in his apartment, which consisted of separate pieces. Numerous newspaper and magazine articles indicated that by this time, Marienetta Jirkowsky was three months pregnant. However, this has not been confirmed by something more reliable, such as an autopsy record from the hospital in Hennigsdorf, or a police report."

        "content": "On 21 November 1980, Marienetta, Vogt, and Wiesner took a train from F\u00fcrstenwalde to East Berlin to look for a good place to escape. They agreed that the spot they previously checked out was not suited for an escape, so they took the S-Bahn back to Hohen Neuendorf that evening. Peter Wiesner was familiar with the border there, from when he worked nearby as a showman. They arrived at the Hohen Neuendorf S-Bahn station at around 12:30 AM, and worked their way across the property near the border. Contrary to their original plan, the three made a spontaneous decision to flee that very night. They did not know that, thanks to this decision, Vogt and Wiesner just barely missed being arrested early the next morning. An informant for the East German secret police, the Stasi, was a member of their group of friends, and betrayed them by reporting their escape plan. Since the fabricated ladder was still in Wiesner's residence, they stole two ladders en route, including a ladder from the yard of a disused restaurant, and a folding stepladder from a neighbouring residence at Florastrasse 2, which was approximately 150 meters from where they attempted their escape.\nOnce in position at the Berlin Wall, they used the stepladder to peer over the inner wall and get a look at the border grounds. For three hours that night, the three young people observed the routine at the border while bolstering each other's courage. Then they separated the stepladder into two parts, and at about 3:30 AM, they used the front part of the stepladder to climb over the inner wall. The larger restaurant ladder was used to get over the next obstacle, a 2.5 meter high signal fence, which the two men overcame without activating the alarm, but when Marienetta followed them, the alarm was triggered. The men had already reached the final obstacle, the 3.5-meter-high outer wall on the border with West Berlin, where the bottom part of the stepladder would be used to scale the outer wall. Although part of the step ladder had sunk into the ground, Vogt and Wiesner were still able to reach the top of the wall, but then shots were fired at them by East German border guards from a watchtower located 160 meters away. Vogt had already jumped down to the West Berlin side, but Wiesner lay down on his stomach on top of the wall because Marienetta, who was standing on the top rung of the ladder, was too short to grasp the wall with her hands. Wiesner reached out his hand to her to pull her up. Two additional border guards, who had run from their watchtower 230 meters away, also started firing at the fugitives. Marienetta had already reached the top of the wall with her hands when she was struck by a bullet and fell off the ladder, while Wiesner fell down on the West Berlin side. A short time later the border guards retrieved Marienetta and provided first aid, then the regiment doctor ordered her to be transported to the nearest hospital in Hennigsdorf, where an emergency operation was performed. Marienetta Jirkowsky died at the hospital at 11:30 AM from a gunshot wound through her abdomen.On the day of the fatal escape attempt, Marienetta Jirkowsky's father was summoned to the East German police in F\u00fcrstenwalde. At first all he learned there was that his daughter had been arrested at the border to West Berlin, and was not informed that she had been killed, until two days later. The family was not allowed to publish an obituary. Spreenhagen, the 18-year-old woman's hometown, was virtually sealed off by Stasi agents when the urn containing her ashes was buried in the town's cemetery. The funeral was attended by her immediate family on 14 December 1980."

        "content": "On behalf of all the Allied city commanders, the French city commander protested that very day against Marienetta Jirkowsky's shooting and demanded that East Germany finally put a stop to their \"inhuman practices\" regarding escapees.The East German secret police went to great effort to prevent any information from 18 year old Jirkowsky's death from leaking out. Under no circumstances was a photograph of the dead woman to be published and many photographs of Marienetta were confiscated from her friends and relatives. The East German secret police tried to make Peter Wiesner and Falko Vogt look like liars by passing a photograph of a woman who resembled Marienetta Jirkowsky on to the western media. The plan was to undermine the validity of all the reporting on the fatal escape attempt by having this photo identified as \"false.\" Another step was taken to publicly discredit the two men who had fled: Informants working for the East German secret police were supposed to win over their confidence and then try to make them look like criminals. They were to \"inconspicuously encourage them to spend large sums of money without deliberation, take out credit, etc., in order to set the preconditions for possible criminal behavior.\" Despite these measures, Falko Vogt and Peter Wiesner were able to provide detailed accounts of the case to the authorities of West Berlin. In early February 1981, they placed a cross at the site where they had escaped to honor Jirkowsky. It was removed by a Stasi informant, Gero Hilliger (IMB Brunnen), and secretly brought to the Stasi in East Berlin. The Stasi also considered extraditing Vogt and Wiesner by taking \"measures to transfer the two men back to East Germany,\" specifically meaning a plan to have them kidnapped and brought back to East Germany against their will.In the aftermath of Marienetta Jirkowsky's death, Falko Vogt became involved in spectacular acts to draw attention to the fate of his friend. On 6 February 1981, he placed charges of murder against the East German minister of defense, Heinz Hoffmann, with the Central Registry Office in Salzgitter. On 2 March 1981, during the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe follow-up conference in Madrid, he chained himself to the entrance gate of the Soviet embassy to denounce the East German government's violation of human rights.Fifteen years later, one of the border guards that shot at Vogt, Wiesner, and Jirkowsky was tried for a \"less serious case of manslaughter\" and sentenced as a youth by the Neuruppin district court to a prison term of one year and three months, which was commuted to probation.In 2009, Hohen Neuendorf city council introduced legislation to rename a traffic circle connected to Florastrasse to commemorate Marienetta Jirkowsky, but was vehemently rejected by her aunt and mother's sister, B\u00e4rbel Kultus. She attempted to act as the spokesperson for the family, since both of Jirkowsky's parents had since died, insisting that there was no merit to have died at the Berlin Wall, and that mourning was a private family matter. Kultus was revealed to have been a high level Stasi informant since 1970 until the dissolution of East Germany, under the codename \"GMS B\u00e4rbel\". Despite her opposition, after months of struggle, the decision was ultimately approved by the Hohen Neuendorf city council on 13 August 2010 and the traffic circle was renamed \"Marienetta-Jirkowsky-Platz\"."

        "content": "Cann and his technicians were among the first to modify commercially available rhythm units or drum machines, so they could alter and override the preset manufacturer programs.  This is notable on \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\", from the album Ha!-Ha!-Ha!. When Ultravox were recording Vienna, Cann's electronic ventures would become important for the Ultravox sound. The acquisition of a Roland CR-78 proved something of a headache for Cann, as he saw great sonic potential in it, but it had limited pattern programmability. In the process of adding some much needed practical customisations to the CR-78, Cann became somewhat persona non grata at the Roland headquarters in the UK. This did not stop Cann from carrying out his plans, and the result proved to be a key factor in the overall sound of their signature hit song \"Vienna\".\nThe initial reaction to the usage of drum machines led to bewilderment among the audience, who wondered what Cann was doing during some songs. Among claims that he was doing nothing, he decided to equip his drum machines with clear perspex cases instead of wood panels, and mount a variety of LEDs inside them as a feature Cann himself described as \"absolutely useless, but very impressive looking on a darkened stage; now it would be obvious I was actually doing something.\" (From Jonas W\u00e5rstad's interview at Discog)\nIn addition to his drum machine work, Cann designed several modifications for bass player Chris Cross' Minimoog, among them a primitive sequencer (built by Roy Gwinn) made from a series of toggle switches to add syncopation to the synthesiser's ability to create a stream of eighth notes, and a proprietary triggering system that allowed Cann and Cross to synchronise the Minimoog with Cann's drum machines, a feat performed almost three years before MIDI was officially introduced in 1983.  According to Midge Ure's autobiography, when the Minimoog broke down on tour, Ultravox borrowed one from The Cars, but it didn't help as it lacked the proprietary modifications."

        "content": "In the spring of 1978, when Ultravox released the Systems of Romance album, Cann's style of drumming turned away from its rock roots and toward what was becoming the New Wave sound. He endeavoured to have extremely precise timing; this would make the songs with live drums match songs driven by electronic, programmed percussion. For an example of this, compare the song \"Sleepwalk\", where Cann plays live drums, to \"Mr. X\", where the drums are sequenced. Both of these tracks can be found on Vienna. Despite his machine-like timing, Cann would often do things that neither drum machines nor electronically sequenced percussion could do at the time.  Specifically, he would often play very precise triplet fills and crescendos, especially on the snare drum. While these two techniques are easily accomplished by electronic instruments today, around 1979\u20131982 they were virtually impossible. In essence, it could fool the listeners to believe they were hearing a drum machine, only to prove them wrong through out-performing the rather rudimentary sequencing possibilities of the time.\nFrom a technical perspective, Cann preferred a traditional grip. On the Quartet album and subsequent tour (1982), Cann employed several sets of Simmons SDS-V electronic percussion pads, even to the point where he had an extra kit consisting of the hexagonal Simmons pads, which he played standing up. This way of playing was relatively unique and Cann seemed to be using this setup for one song only, namely \"The Song (We Go)\" from Quartet."

The company produced MT-USA (Music Television USA), a three-hour-long music video show modelled on the new American cable channel, MTV. MT-USA was broadcast on RT\u00c9 from 1984 to 1987 on Sunday afternoons. Each block of videos was followed by a segment filmed in New York City with Hanley introducing the videos, discussing American music and culture, and interviewing a celebrity. RT\u00c9 described him as Europe's first VJ (video jockey).In 1987, Hanley died shortly after his 33rd birthday. He had been visibly ill for some time, and was rumoured to have an AIDS-related illness, which he denied. This reflected the stigma then associated with the disease and with homosexuality in Ireland, which was not decriminalised until 1993. The illness admitted by Hanley was congenital cerebral toxoplasmosis, described as an \"eye disorder\"; he was blind in one eye by his death. Toxoplasmosis is very rarely fatal in adults who do not have a weakened immune system. In 2000, Hanley's friend and colleague Bill Hughes, who had himself come out in the 1990s, agreed that Hanley had in fact died of an AIDS-related illness. The same year, the Sunday Tribune newspaper placed Hanley at the top of a list of Irish gay icons.In February 2022, RT\u00c9 aired a new documentary about Hanley, titled Vincent Hanley: Sex, Lies and Videotapes.\n\n\n== References =="

Born in 1930, he was the second eldest in a family of ten brothers and sisters and grew up in the Fillmore district of San Francisco. A community character, he was instrumental in the political fight against the city to stop the demolition of the International Hotel on Kearny Street. He was also a prominent member of the San Francisco-based Asian American writers' collective Kearny Street Workshop.Al Robles combined heritage with experience. His poetry and community work honored Filipino elders (Manongs) and also inspired and encouraged the young students, activists, writers and artists to connect to their Filipino heritage. Verses about traditional Filipino foods, his experiences in Hawaii, New Mexico, and community personalities in San Francisco resulted in countless poems, and two published works: \"Looking for Ifugao Mountain: Paghahanap Sa Bundok Ng Ifugao and Rappin' with Ten Thousand Carabaos in the Dark.\nIn 2008, filmmaker Curtis Choy released a documentary about Al Robles called Manilatown is in the Heart: Time Travel with Al Robles, focusing on Robles' many personalities and community roles. It has been shown at countless film festivals, including the 2009 DisOrient Film Festival, in Eugene, OR, Asian Pacific Heritage Month 2009 in Los Altos Hills, and the 2009 Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, where it was a Finalist for the Grand Jury Award for Best Documentary."

The couple had six children, all of whom died in infancy. Lydia died in childbirth on 27 August 1794, her child (the sixth) being stillborn: the cause may have been the injuries she had sustained when a loyalist \"Church and King\" mob attacked the Hardy home some weeks earlier.

His first was \"1980's Teddy Boy\", and later came \"Concrete Jungle\" which was recorded by The Specials for their debut album, Specials (1979).\nByers joined The Specials when the band was called The Coventry Automatics and wrote several songs for the band. The most successful was \"Rat Race\", which peaked at number five in the UK Singles Chart in May 1980. Byers also wrote \"Hey Little Rich Girl\", which appeared on The Specials second album, More Specials (1980). \"Hey Little Rich Girl\" was released as a single in Japan by Chrysalis Records in 1980, and covered by Amy Winehouse on her album Back to Black. Byers sang the lead vocal on \"Concrete Jungle\" and \"Braggin' and Tryin' Not to Lie\", which was released as a free single with initial copies of More Specials. \"Braggin' and Tryin' Not to Lie\" was credited to Roddy Radiation & The Specials.After The Specials split in 1981, Byers was dropped by Chrysalis before he re-emerged with The Tearjerkers, a band that he had begun in the last months of The Specials. The band played numerous gigs and gained a cult following. The band originally were Roddy Byers (vocals/guitar), Mark Byers (vocals/guitar), Joe Hughes (vocals/bass), Pete Davies (drums) and Slim Tearjerker aka Clive Pain (vocals/keyboards/accordion). The later version was comprised Roddy Byers (vocals/guitar) Mark Byers (vocals/guitar) Badger (bass) and Tony Lynch (drums). The Tearjerkers were signed up by Chiswick Records in 1982, and released their debut single \"Desire\" b/w \"Western Song\". The band finally split in 1987 because, as Roddy commented, \"after seven years there was no major recording success\".The Bonediggers were formed shortly after the Tearjerkers ended in 1987. The band released a self-titled album on Rimshot Records the following year with a rawer, hard-edged rockabilly sound. The Bonediggers consisted of Roddy Radiation (vocals/guitar), David West (vocals/guitar), Sam Smith (bass), and Gary Muldoon (drums), later replaced by Jim Pryall. Byers still plays with Sam Smith to this day in The Skabilly Rebels. The Bonediggers would transition into The Raiders, shortly before Byers reunited with several members of the Specials to form The Specials MK2.\nByers was an essential part of The Specials 2, who formed in the early 1990s after teaming up with Desmond Dekker for the King of Kings album. The group toured for a couple of years throughout the UK, America and Japan. They released two singles  \"Hypocrite\" and a cover of Toots & the Maytals \"Pressure Drop\". The band recorded two albums 1996 Today's Specials, a compilation of covers and 1998 Guilty 'til Proved Innocent! which were made up of original material. Byers contributed songs for latter's \"Tears in My Beer,\" \"Bonediggin',\" \"Keep on Learning\" and \"The Man With No Name\".\nAfter The Specials 2, Byers worked with the acoustic project, Three Men & Black, which consisted of Jean Jacques Burnel (The Stranglers), Jake Burns (Stiff Little Fingers), Pauline Black (The Selecter), Bruce Foxton (The Jam) and Dave Wakeling (The Beat, General Public) and Nick Welsh (Skaville UK).\nByers' current band, The Skabilly Rebels, are based in Coventry. They are Roddy Byers - lead guitar, vocals; Adrian Lee - saxophone, keyboards;\nJoe Harcourt - second guitar, backing vocals;, Connor O\u2019Connor - bass guitar and Matt Hart - drums.\nThey released their debut album Blues Attack at the end of 2009 and toured the United States in 2012 and regularly tour The UK, Ireland and Europe."

At a young age, Hong learned to sing and play violin. He first performed at Taihoku City Public Auditorium as part of a children's group, and later as a singer of Japanese patriotic songs. Inspired by Haruo Oka, Hong quit his job at a lumber mill to become a singer, writing his first song, Butterfly in Love with a Flower (\u8776\u6200\u82b1), aged 19 in 1946 under the stage name Hong Wen-chang (\u6d2a\u6587\u660c; \u00c2ng B\u00fbn-chh\u00f4ng). He led a group of singers that performed frequently near the Danshui River until the February 28 Incident forced Hong to move to Tainan. Hong began singing on the radio in 1948, alongside Chi Lu-hsia and others. His radio performances drove his popularity, and, in 1957, he released his debut album A Handsome Young Man on a Hilltop (Chinese: \u5c71\u9802\u9ed1\u72d7\u5144; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: Soa\u207f-t\u00e9ng O\u0358-k\u00e1u Hia\u207f), under his best known stage name Ang It-hong, which was suggested by a fortune teller. His first album featured Hokkien lyrics set to Japanese melodies. Most of his works are songs in Hokkien. Ang's music frequently fused enka with jazz. He worked closely with lyricist Yeh Chun-lin on songs such as Memories of an Old Love (\u820a\u60c5\u7dbf\u7dbf; K\u016b Ch\u00eang M\u00ee M\u00ee) and The One Adored (\u601d\u6155\u7684\u4eba). Ang appeared in the 1962 film Love Never Ceases, which featured the song Memories of an Old Love and several others written by Ang, which appeared on his second album Endless Love, featuring original melodies. Ang spent the late 1960s and 1970s in Japan, as Kuomintang authorities censored Hokkien pop and other media. As restrictions against Hokkien media were lifted in the 1980s, and martial law was suspended, one of Ang's students, Jody Chiang, rose to stardom. Ang also wrote songs for his son Chris.By the time of his death, Ang had over 200 compositions to his name. Ang died from pancreatic cancer on 24 February 2010 at Taipei Medical University Hospital. His funeral was held on 13 March. He was posthumously awarded a Golden Melody Award for Special Contributions in June 2010. A virtual museum was set up in April 2011 to memorialize Ang's life and career. Ang's three sons produced and released a musical documentary about their father later that year."

In 1994, he was traded to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.\nKrygier played a season and a half in Anaheim before he was re-acquired by the Capitals during the 1995\u201396 NHL season. It was during his second tour with the Capitals that he would make the most of his opportunity as his gritty style of play would help guide the Capitals to their first ever appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1998. Krygier played two seasons with the Orlando Solar Bears of the International Hockey League before retiring from active play.\nPerhaps Krygier's most memorable goal came in the 1998 Eastern Conference Finals as a member of the Capitals versus the visiting Buffalo Sabres. In overtime of game two, Krygier one-timed a pass from teammate Andrei Nikolishin past Sabres goaltender Dominik Ha\u0161ek to win the game and tie the series at one game apiece. The goal was controversial because of the possibility that the Capitals had iced the puck and a Sabre had touched it behind the goal line, but play was not whistled down. The Capitals went on to win the series in six games before being swept by the Detroit Red Wings in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nKrygier was previously the head coach of the Compuware AAA mite hockey team, as well as the head hockey coach at Novi High School where he won the school's first and only State Title in 2011. In June 2013, Krygier was announced as the new coach of the Muskegon Lumberjacks United States Hockey League team until he was released in July 2016. He is now an assistant coach with the Western Michigan Broncos men's ice hockey team.In 543 NHL games, Krygier scored 100 goals and 143 assists."

A well-traveled utility, he played with six different teams in a span of nine years, including two stints for the Giants. His most productive season came in 1927, when he posted career-highs with a .316 batting average, 92 RBI, 57 runs, and 152 games while playing three different infield positions for the Giants and Braves, being considered in the National League MVP vote at the end of the season. He played exclusively at shortstop 132 games for the 1928 Braves and also won a World Series ring with the Yankees 1932 World Champions, despite he did not play in the Series.\nIn a nine-season career, Farrell was a .260 hitter (467-for-1799) with ten home runs and 213 RBI in 591 games, including 181 runs, 63 doubles, eight triples, and 14 stolen bases.

Despite being a sympathizer of Get\u00falio Vargas, Paul was a part of the Jewish underground resistance. Anna eventually suffered from a major paralysis due to a trauma caused by the fact that Jorge's sister, Susana, was not able to embark to Brazil with them, and so until he was 7 years old a nanny, L\u00facia, took care of him; L\u00facia was a m\u00e3e-de-santo, and introduced Jorge to Candombl\u00e9.\nIn 1948 Jorge's parents divorced, and Anna eventually remarried Henri M\u00fcller, a violinist who played for the S\u00e3o Paulo State Symphony, and who taught Jorge how to play the violin. His family later moved to S\u00e3o Paulo, where he studied at the prestigious Col\u00e9gio Dante Alighieri; despite being an excellent student, he would, however, be expelled before he could graduate from high school because of a text he wrote, considered \"indecent\" by his teachers.\nMautner began to write his first book, Deus da Chuva e da Morte, when he was 15 years old; it was published in 1962, and in the following year it won the Pr\u00eamio Jabuti. Deus da Chuva e da Morte would be the first part of what is today known as his Mitologia do Kaos trilogy, which also comprises Kaos (1963) and Narciso em Tarde Cinza (1965). In it, Mautner would define the main ideology of what he calls the \"Kaos Movement\".\nIn 1962 he joined the Brazilian Communist Party, after being invited by M\u00e1rio Schenberg.\nMautner was arrested during the 1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat, but was later released, under the conditions of \"expressing himself more carefully\". In 1966 he recorded his first musical release, the 7\" single \"Radioatividade\", through RCA Records. Soon after he travelled to the United States, where he worked for the UNESCO and as a translator of Brazilian books. He later met poet Robert Lowell, serving as his secretary, as well as Paul Goodman, with whom he developed a strong friendship and suffered an everlasting influence from him.\nIn 1968 he briefly returned to Brazil, where he worked as screenwriter on Neville d'Almeida's film Jardim de Guerra, that was only released two years later.\nIn 1970 he travelled to London, where he befriended Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. He later returned to Brazil, settling in Rio de Janeiro once more, where he began to write for the humoristic newspaper O Pasquim. In the same year he directed the film O Demiurgo, which starred himself, Gil, Veloso, Jos\u00e9 Roberto Aguilar, P\u00e9ricles Cavalcanti and Leilah Assun\u00e7\u00e3o. The film was censored by the dictatorship though, and never received a wide release. (In 2013 Mautner made the film available in its entirety through his official YouTube channel.) Around the same time he met N\u00e9lson Jacobina, one of his most prolific songwriting partners, with whom he wrote, among many other songs, the 1974 hit \"Maracatu At\u00f4mico\".\nOn December 10, 1973, Mautner was invited to partake in the Banquete dos Mendigos \"show-manifesto\", idealized and directed by Jards Macal\u00e9. The show, that happened at the Museum of Modern Art of Rio de Janeiro and was backed by the UN, celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and also counted with the presence of Chico Buarque, Dominguinhos, Edu Lobo, Gal Costa, Gonzaguinha, Johnny Alf, Luiz Melodia, Milton Nascimento, MPB4, N\u00e9lson Jacobina, Paulinho da Viola and Raul Seixas, among others. It spawned a double-disc live album, which due to censorship issues was only released in 1979.In 1988 Mautner took part in a short-lived \"joke side project\" formed by then-Tit\u00e3s member Arnaldo Antunes named Vestidos de Espa\u00e7o, which also comprised Branco Mello, Charles Gavin, Paula Toller of Kid Abelha and record producer Liminha. The band's only release before their demise in the following year was a 7\" single with the tracks \"Pipi Pop\u00f4\" and \"A Marcha do Demo\"; the latter was included in the Tit\u00e3s compilation album E-collection from 2000.In 2002 Mautner served as a guest musician on synth-pop band Metr\u00f4's third album, D\u00e9j\u00e0-Vu, providing violin and additional vocals for a track. In the same year he released a collaborative album with Caetano Veloso, Eu N\u00e3o Pe\u00e7o Desculpa, which won the Latin Grammy Award in 2003.\nA documentary about Mautner, directed by Pedro Bial and Heitor d'Alincourt, was released in 2012 to positive reception, entitled Jorge Mautner: O Filho do Holocausto; it was inspired by his autobiography of the same name, published in 2006. In the same year he collaborated with Rog\u00e9rio Skylab in his album Abismo e Carnaval, writing the lyrics and providing additional vocals for the track \"Palmeira Brasileira\".\nOn January 17, 2016, coinciding with his 75th birthday, Mautner published his eleventh book, Kaos Total.On July 28, 2016, it was reported that Mautner suffered a heart attack and was rushed to the Hospital Samaritano in Rio. He underwent a surgery to implant four stents into his heart, but eventually recovered. One month later, on August 30, he announced that he began work on a 10-volume series of books about his years as a militant for the Brazilian Communist Party during the mid-1960s.In 2017 Mautner appeared in La\u00eds Bodanzky's film Just Like Our Parents as Homero Fabri.\nIn April 2019 he released his first studio album in 12 years, entitled N\u00e3o H\u00e1 Abismo em que o Brasil Caiba. One of the album's tracks is a tribute to feminist/LGBT activist Marielle Franco, murdered in 2018. The album was considered one of the 25 best Brazilian albums of the first half of 2019 by the S\u00e3o Paulo Association of Art Critics."

Convinced that, so long as his fellow Protestants feared to make common cause with the Catholic majority, the British Crown would continue to govern Ireland in the interest of England and of its client aristocracy, in 1791 Tone helped form the Society of United Irishmen. Although received in the company of a Catholic delegation by the King and his ministers in London, Tone, with other United Irish leaders, despaired of constitutional reform. Fuelled by the popular grievances of rents, tithes and taxes, and driven by martial-law repression, the society developed as an insurrectionary movement. When, in the early summer of 1798, it broke into open rebellion, Tone was in exile soliciting assistance from the French Republic. In October 1798, on his second attempt to land in Ireland with French troops and supplies, he was taken prisoner. Sentenced to be hanged, he died from a reportedly self-inflicted wound.\nSince the mid-nineteenth century, his name has been invoked, and his legacy disputed, by different factions of Irish Republicanism. These have held annual, but separate, commemorations at his graveside in Bodenstown, County Kildare."

        "content": "Tone was born on 20 June 1763. His father, Peter Tone, was a prosperous coach-maker who had a farm near Sallins, County Kildare and adhered to the established Anglican church. Although records are absent, he is said to have been the descendant, from the 17th century, of a Cromwellian soldier (\"the first Tone to settle in Ireland\"):\u200a47\u200a and of French Huguenot refugees. His mother, Margaret Lamport, the daughter of a sea captain in the West India trade, was a Catholic who according to Tone's early biographer, R.R. Madden, converted to her husband's church only when Tone was already eight years old. Tone, nonetheless, was baptised a Protestant, with the name Theobald Wolfe in honour of his godfather, Theobald Wolfe of Blackhall, County Kildare, a first cousin of Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden.:\u200a11\u200aIn 1783, Tone found work as a tutor to Anthony and Robert, younger half-brothers of Richard Martin, a Patriot member of the Irish Parliament for Jamestown, County Leitrim. Tone fell in love with Martin's well-connected wife, Elizabeth Vesey. While Tone later wrote that it came to nothing, a Martin biographer suspects that he was the father of the Martins' first child Laetitia born in 1785.:\u200a24\u201325,\u200a29\u200aTone studied law at Trinity College Dublin, where Kilwarden remembered him as a \"sparkling conversationalist and rising talent\".:\u200a387\u200a Tone was active in the College Historical Society, which had a record for honing oratory skills and preparing members for a life in politics. He was made a scholar in 1784 and graduated BA in February 1786. In 1798, after training in London's Middle Temple, he qualified in Dublin's King's Inns, as a barrister, a profession with which he was already disenchanted.As a student, he had eloped with Martha (Matilda) Witherington, daughter of William and Catherine Witherington (n\u00e9e Fanning) of Dublin. When they married, Tone was 22, and Matilda was about 16. With the arrival of their first daughter, and his father's bankruptcy denying him an inheritance, he cast about for new employment. To British Prime Minister William Pitt, in 1788 he submitted a plan for a Roman-style military colony on Captain Cook's newly reported Sandwich Islands.:\u200a83\u201384\u200a When this elicited no response, he sought enlistment as a soldier in the East India Company but applied too late in the year to be shipped to south Asia. Styling himself an \"independent Irish Whig\", he followed the example of a number of college friends and began reporting on the proceedings of the Irish Parliament and the conduct of the London-appointed Dublin Castle executive.:\u200a40"

Another son, Richard Tone (born between 1787 and 1789) died in infancy.Only his son William Theobald Wolfe Tone survived to adulthood. Raised in France by his mother after Tone's death, William was appointed a cadet in the Imperial School of Cavalry in 1810 on Napoleon's orders. He was a naturalised French citizen on 4 May 1812.
