        "content": "Joe Bianchi (August 5, 1871 in Origgio, Italy \u2013 May 29, 1949) was a world-class spur maker who immigrated to Victoria, Texas in December 1885 and died in Victoria at the age of 77. Bianchi's particular style became known across Southwest Texas as the Victoria Shank or bottle-opener spur, terms which are still used today by collectors, some sixty years after production of these much sought-after custom, handmade spurs ceased.Bianchi's father, Luigi (Louis), purchased a farm after arriving in Texas. The 1900 Census listed Louis and his youngest son as farmer. By contrast, Joe and his older brother Paul were listed as blacksmith by trade at the time of their arrival, no doubt due to some experience gained in Italy.\nBianchi worked in partnership with other blacksmith shops, including with brother Paul at Bianchi Brothers Blacksmith Shop in 1901. Sometime after his marriage to Mathilde Urban on February 22, 1905, Bianchi opened his own shop next to their home on South William Street. This shop became a popular place for family, friends, cowboys and cattlemen to meet and visit. One could purchase spurs, bits, and branding irons and have repairs made to carriages, farming implements and household items. Bianchi built park benches for the city square around 1920.  As a testimony to the quality of his work, a number of these benches can still be seen in Victoria over 80 years later.After the introduction of the automobile resulted in a switch among the population away from horse and buggy, Paul's work turned to the automobile while Joe continued to concentrate on the needs of the cowboys and cattlemen, in particular, the spurs, bits and branding irons needed for their work. In addition to the distinctive bottle-opener style, some spurs and bits made by the Bianchi brothers can also be identified by markings such as BIANCHI, HANDFORGED and VICTORIA, TEX.\n \nBianchi offered to repair or replace any spur that proved defective without charge.  He also created a pocket size catalog so his products could be ordered by mail.  As a result, his products found a market throughout the United States and some foreign countries. He also placed advertisements in The Cattleman magazine as well as the Running W Saddle Shop catalog of the famous King Ranch in south Texas.\n \nJoe was also known for his support of the church and various schools in town. He also joined the local Spanish American militia unit and was an active member of the Victoria Fire Department right up to the final years of his life. For his industriousness, civic mindedness and decent living, Joe was highly respected by all who knew and worked with him."

        "title": "Epicurus_sum",
        "content": "Epicurus (, EH-pih-KURE-\u0259s; Greek: \u1f18\u03c0\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 Epikouros; 341\u2013270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and sage who founded Epicureanism, a highly influential school of philosophy. He was born on the Greek island of Samos to Athenian parents. Influenced by Democritus, Aristippus, Pyrrho, and possibly the Cynics, he turned against the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known as \"the Garden\", in Athens. Epicurus and his followers were known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of philosophical subjects. He openly allowed women and slaves to join the school as a matter of policy. Of the over 300 works said to have been written by Epicurus about various subjects, the vast majority have been destroyed. Only three letters written by him\u2014the letters to Menoeceus, Pythocles, and Herodotus\u2014and two collections of quotes\u2014the Principal Doctrines and the Vatican Sayings\u2014have survived intact, along with a few fragments of his other writings. As a result of his work's destruction, most knowledge about his philosophy is due to later authors, particularly the biographer Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, the Epicurean Roman poet Lucretius and the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus, as well as the hostile but largely accurate accounts by the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus, and the Academic Skeptic and statesman Cicero.\nEpicurus asserted that philosophy's purpose is to attain as well as to help others attain happy (eudaimonic), tranquil lives characterized by ataraxia (peace and freedom from fear) and aponia (the absence of pain). He advocated that people were best able to pursue philosophy by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that the root of all human neuroses is denial of death and the tendency for human beings to assume that death will be horrific and painful, which he claimed causes unnecessary anxiety, selfish self-protective behaviors, and hypocrisy. According to Epicurus, death is the end of both the body and the soul and therefore should not be feared. Epicurus taught that although the gods exist, they have no involvement in human affairs. He taught that people should act ethically not because the gods punish or reward them for their actions but because, due to the power of guilt, amoral behavior would inevitably lead to remorse weighing on their consciences and as a result, they would be prevented from attaining ataraxia. \nEpicurus derived much of his physics and cosmology from the earlier philosopher Democritus (c. 460\u2013c. 370 BC). Like Democritus, Epicurus taught that the universe is infinite and eternal and that all matter is made up of extremely tiny, invisible particles known as atoms. All occurrences in the natural world are ultimately the result of atoms moving and interacting in empty space. Epicurus deviated from Democritus by proposing the idea of atomic \"swerve\", which holds that atoms may deviate from their expected course, thus permitting humans to possess free will in an otherwise deterministic universe.\nThough popular, Epicurean teachings were controversial from the beginning. Epicureanism reached the height of its popularity during the late years of the Roman Republic. It died out in late antiquity, subject to hostility from early Christianity. Throughout the Middle Ages Epicurus was popularly, though inaccurately, remembered as a patron of drunkards, whoremongers, and gluttons. His teachings gradually became more widely known in the fifteenth century with the rediscovery of important texts, but his ideas did not become acceptable until the seventeenth century, when the French Catholic priest Pierre Gassendi revived a modified version of them, which was promoted by other writers, including Walter Charleton and Robert Boyle. His influence grew considerably during and after the Enlightenment, profoundly impacting the ideas of major thinkers, including John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Jeremy Bentham, and Karl Marx."

The duo began writing songs together as early as the eighth grade (the reggae tune \"Makisupa Policeman\" is often regarded as the duo's first collaboration and the very first Phish original song). Other early collaborations include Bivouac Jaun, a project recorded by Marshall, Anastasio, and their friend Marc Daubert (who occasionally played percussion with Phish in 1984 and wrote the lyrics to their classic \"The Curtain With\"). Many of the pieces recorded on Bivouac Jaun appeared on The White Tape. Marshall also was instrumental in influencing The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday, a Phish concept album and song cycle about the mystical land of Gamehendge written by Anastasio and used as his senior thesis at Goddard College in 1987.\nMarshall, Anastasio, and friends would meet at The Rhombus, a giant piece of art located in a park next to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and embark on lengthy songwriting sessions. Many characters and locations mentioned in early Phish songs reference these songwriting sessions. In one instance, Marshall wrote the original lyrics to the Gamehendge song \"McGrupp and the Watchful Hosemasters\" and nailed them to Anastasio's front door. By 1985, Anastasio and Marshall had parted ways as Anastasio became more involved with Phish at the University of Vermont.\nYears later in 1989, Marshall apparently heard Phish's Junta album and thought to himself, \"these guys really need lyrics.\" Marshall and Anastasio reunited and began a long songwriting partnership that resulted in over 100 songs over the next fifteen years. Anastasio's 2005 solo album Shine marks the first time since the pre-Junta years that he has not worked with Marshall.\nIn addition to working closely with Anastasio, Marshall fronts his own band, Amfibian, currently on hiatus.\nIn the fall of 2010, Marshall collaborated with CT jam band The McLovins to co-write \"Cohesive\", recorded with Marshall and Anthony Krizan (of Spin Doctors fame) at Krizan's Sonic Boom studios. In mid-November 2010, Marshall joined his longtime friend Trey Anastasio on stage at the historic Richardson Auditorium in Alexander Hall Princeton University bringing them back to their roots.\nMarshall has a wife named Lea-Lea, a daughter named Anna and a son named Brodie."

His writing caught the attention of Paul Kelty, then the news editor of Portland's The Oregonian, who recommended Lampman to editor-in-chief Edgar B. Piper.  He was hired, moved to Portland, and began working for The Oregonian on February 1, 1916.  For his first 14 months at the paper, he covered police-related news, but also wrote editorials from time to time. In 1920, he published an account of the 1919 Centralia Massacre.  In additional to part-time editorial writing, he worked as a reporter and feature writer for The Oregonian until 1922, when the paper made him a full-time editorial writer and an associate editor. He also wrote nature essays in The Oregonian.His stories and essays also appeared in national magazines such as the Saturday Evening Post. Some of his essays about life in Portland were collected in his 1942 book At the End of the Car Line. In 1943 he won an O. Henry Award for his short story \"Blinker Was a Good Dog\" which originally appeared in the Atlantic Monthly. Some of his papers and manuscripts are now in the collection of the library of the University of Oregon. Others reside at Lewis and Clark College and the Oregon Historical Society. The Lewis and Clark Collection also contains, on loan, from the family of Ben's long-time friend, Elizabeth Salway Ryan, Ben's typewriter, his trademark glasses, a complete set of proofs of all 14 of his books and many more items.\nLampman also wrote a column in The Oregonian entitled \"Where to Bury A Dog\" which is frequently cited in pet memorials.  It was included in How Could I Be Forgetting, a 1926 compilation of the author's essays and poems.  In total, he authored six books.Lampman was still an associate editor at The Oregonian in early 1951, when a stroke took him off the job, eventually leading to retirement.  He was named poet laureate of Oregon on February 20, 1951.In the 1980s, Elizabeth Salway Ryan wrote a biography, The Magic of Ben Hur Lampman. The typescript was published in a very limited edition by Grandson Mark Anders Kronquist and Daughter Sally Ryan Tomlinson. Copies of the first edition typescript are in the collections of the University of Oregon, The Lake Oswego Public Library, the Library of Congress and the Oregon Historical Society. In 2011, as a part of the celebration, Lewis and Clark College printed several hundred copies of the typescript."

        "content": "Sergio Ortega Alvarado was born in Antofagasta, Chile on February 2, 1938. He had brief studies of Architecture and Literature, until he entered the National Conservatory of the University of Chile and began to study composition with Roberto Falabella and Gustavo Becerra-Schmidt. After graduating, he worked at the Institute of Musical Extension and six years as a sound engineer at the Experimental Theater of the University, at the Antonio Varas Theater.During this period he composed music for theater and cinema. he composed music for works by Alejandro Sieveking and Isidora Aguirre, including Asunto sofisticado and La dama del canasto, respectively. In 1964, the filmmaker Pedro Chaskel heads the music project for the 1925 silent film, El H\u00fasar de la muerte by Pedro Sienna, commissioned by Ortega himself, who made a special composition that was registered in the Hall of Honor of the University of Chile. Later he composed the soundtrack of El Chacal de Nahueltoro in 1969 by filmmaker Miguel Littin. In 2001, he also composed a song for the film Taxi para tres. Ortega's music was based mainly on a typical classical music sound, full of polyphonies and dissonances. His colleague, Luis Advis, also presented these characteristics within his music.Pablo Neruda entrusted him with musicalizing the assembly of his translation of Romeo and Juliet. Later, he would ask her to compose the soundtrack for his only play, Fulgor y muerte de Joaqu\u00edn Murieta, premiered in 1967 at the Antonio Varas Theater, under the direction of Pedro Orthous. The work, which made a successful tour of Europe, tells the story of Joaqu\u00edn Murieta, a Chilean gold prospector who comes to California in search of fortune. The story had already appeared in Neruda's books as the fourth episode of La barcarola. However, Neruda writes the play, with characters, dialogues, script, etc. On December 14, 1998, the two-act opera Fulgor y muerte de Joaqu\u00edn Murieta, composed by him and with a libretto based on the homonymous work by Neruda, premiered at the Municipal Theatre of Santiago.In 1967, he worked with the singer-songwriter V\u00edctor Jara in the musical arrangements of some of the songs on his self-titled album, at the same time he directed his orchestra that he accompanied on the tracks \"El aparecido\", \"Solo\" and \"As\u00ed como hoy matan negros\". Ortega was a member of the Communist Party of Chile. He together with the singer-songwriter Victor Jara and the lyricist Claudio Iturra, he composed \"Venceremos\" the electoral theme of the socialist president Salvador Allende and a world anthem of leftist movements. He composed the 1970 album by Inti-Illimani, Canto al programa, with contributions from Luis Advis and lyrics by Julio Rojas. He also worked on a musical version of Neruda's Canto General with Gustavo Becerra and the group Aparcoa, which was staged in 1970. About three months before the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat against La Moneda, he recorded \"El pueblo unido jam\u00e1s ser\u00e1 vencido\" together with the group Quilapay\u00fan, a recognized worldwide protest anthem. After the coup, he took refuge in the embassy of Panama. He then moved to France, where he would continue his musical career.In 1978, he composed and premiered at an Austrian festival, Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme, 1810. Poema sonoro para el padre de mi patria. For the celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution, Ortegra worked on a praised operatic trilogy. Ortega worked with his eldest son, Cha\u00f1aral Ortega-Miranda (later member of the French faction of Quilapay\u00fan), on an operatic version of Pedro P\u00e1ramo, the novel by Mexican writer Juan Rulfo.In 1970, he began to direct the university's TV station, Channel 9, which he continued until 1973. In 1977 Ortega visited the USSR, participated in the festival \"Red Carnation\". He was given permission to return to Chile in 1983, and did so several times. During his exile, Ortega directed L'Ecole Nationale de Musique, in Pantin, France. \nDuring the 30th anniversary of the Military Coup, he was diagnosed with advanced Pancreatic cancer. In September 2003, Sergio Ortega was already in a coma at the Saint Louis hospital in Paris. He died on September 15, at the age of 65, surrounded by his wife and their three sons. On the 27th of the same month, his remains would be buried in the General Cemetery. The Workers' United Center, the Antonio Varas Theater and the Faculty of Arts of the University of Chile made official tributes. In the Municipal Theatre, the choir led by Max Vald\u00e9s, interpreted the final parts of Fulgor y muerte de Joaqu\u00edn Murieta."

        "content": "Rackham was born at 210 South Lambeth Road, Vauxhall, London as one of 12 children. In 1884, at the age of 17, he was sent on an ocean voyage to Australia to improve his fragile health, accompanied by two aunts.  At the age of 18, he worked as an insurance clerk at the Westminster Fire Office and began studying part-time at the Lambeth School of Art.In 1892, he left his job and started working for the Westminster Budget as a reporter and illustrator. His first book of illustrations were published in 1893 in To the Other Side by Thomas Rhodes, but his first serious commission was in 1894 for The Dolly Dialogues, the collected sketches of Anthony Hope, who later went on to write The Prisoner of Zenda. Book illustrating then became Rackham's career for the rest of his life.\nBy the turn of the century, Rackham had developed a reputation for pen and ink fantasy illustration with richly illustrated gift books such as The Ingoldsby Legends (1898), Gulliver's Travels and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm (both 1900). This was developed further through the austere years of the Boer War with regular contributions to children's periodicals such as Little Folks and Cassell's Magazine. In 1901 he moved to Wychcombe Studios near Haverstock Hill, and in 1903 married his neighbour Edyth Starkie. Edyth suffered a miscarriage in 1904, but the couple had one daughter, Barbara, in 1908. Although acknowledged as an accomplished black-and-white book illustrator for some years, it was the publication of his full-colour plates to Washington Irving's Rip Van Winkle by Heinemann in 1905 that particularly brought him into public attention, his reputation being confirmed the following year with J.M.Barrie's Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, published by Hodder & Stoughton. Income from the books was greatly augmented by annual exhibitions of the artwork at the Leicester Galleries. Rackham won a gold medal at the Milan International Exhibition in 1906 and another one at the Barcelona International Exposition in 1912. His works were included in numerous exhibitions, including one at the Louvre in Paris in 1914. Rackham was a member of the Art Workers' Guild and was elected its Master in 1919.From 1906 the family lived in Chalcot Gardens, near Haverstock Hill, until moving from London to Houghton, West Sussex in 1920. In 1929, the family settled into a newly built property in Limpsfield, Surrey. Ten years later, Arthur Rackham died at home of cancer."

        "content": "Arthur Rackham is widely regarded as one of the leading illustrators from the 'Golden Age' of British book illustration which roughly encompassed the years from 1890 until the end of the First World War. During that period, there was a strong market for high quality illustrated books which typically were given as Christmas gifts. Many of Rackham's books were produced in a de luxe limited edition, often vellum bound and usually signed, as well as a smaller, less ornately bound quarto 'trade' edition. This was sometimes followed by a more modestly presented octavo edition in subsequent years for particularly popular books. The onset of the war in 1914 curtailed the market for such quality books, and the public's taste for fantasy and fairies also declined in the 1920s.\nSutherland, referring to Rackham's work in the 20th century, states: \"Rackham was, without doubt, one of the finest illustrators of the century.\" In his survey of British Book Illustration, Salaman stated: \"Mr. Rackham stands apart from all the other illustrators of the day; his genius is so thoroughly original. Scores of others have depicted fairyland and wonderland, but who else has given us so absolutely individual and persuasively suggestive a vision of their marvels and allurements? Whose elves are so elfish, whose witches and gnomes are so convincingly of their kind, as Mr. Rackham's?\"Carpenter and Prichard noted that \"For all the virtuosity of his work in colour, Rackham remained an artist in line, his mastery having its roots in his early work for periodicals, then breaking free to create the swirling intricate pictures of his prime, and finally reaching the economy and impressionism of his last work.\" They also remarked on his decline: \"Rackham made his name in a heyday of fairy literature and other fantasy which the First World War brought to an end.\" House stated that Rackham \"concentrated on the illustration of books and particularly those of a mystical, magic or legendary background. He very soon established himself as one of the foremost Edwardian illustrators and was triumphant in the early 1900s when colour printing first enabled him to use subtle tints and muted tones to represent age and timelessness. Rackham's imaginative eye saw all forms with the eyes of childhood and created a world that was half reassuring and half frightening.\"Hamilton summarised his article on Rackham in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography thus: \"Rackham brought a renewed sense of excitement to book illustration that coincided with the rapid developments in printing technology in the early twentieth century. Working with subtle colour and wiry line, he exploited the growing strengths of commercial printing to create imagery and characterizations that reinvigorated children's literature, electrified young readers, and dominated the art of book illustration at the start of a new century.\"Arthur Rackham's works have become very popular since his death, both in North America and Britain. His images have been widely used by the greeting card industry and many of his books are still in print or have been recently available in both paperback and hardback editions. His original drawings and paintings are keenly sought at the major international art auction houses."

        "content": "Rackham's illustrations were chiefly based on robust pen and India ink drawings. Rackham gradually perfected his own uniquely expressive line from his background in journalistic illustration, paired with subtle use of watercolour, a technique which he was able to exploit due to technological developments in photographic reproduction. With this development, Rackham's illustrations no longer needed an engraver (lacking Rackham's talent) to cut clean lines on a wood or metal plate for printing because the artist merely had his works photographed and mechanically reproduced.Rackham would first lightly block in shapes and details of the drawing with a soft pencil, for the more elaborate colour plates often utilising one of a small selection of compositional devices. Over this, he would then carefully work in lines of pen and India ink, removing the pencil traces after the drawing had begun to take form. For colour pictures, Rackham preferred the 3-colour process or trichromatic printing, which reproduced the delicate half-tones of photography through letterpress printing. He would begin painting by building up multiple thin washes of watercolour creating translucent tints. One of the disadvantages of the 3-colour (later 4-colour) printing process in the early years was that definition could be lost in the final print. Rackham would sometimes compensate for this by over-inking his drawings once more after painting. He would also go on to expand the use of silhouette cuts in illustration work, particularly in the period after the First World War, as exemplified by his Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.Typically, Rackham contributed both colour and monotone illustrations towards the works incorporating his images \u2013 and in the case of Hawthorne's Wonder Book, he also provided a number of part-coloured block images similar in style to Meiji era Japanese woodblocks.\nRackham's work is often described as a fusion of a northern European 'Nordic' style strongly influenced by the Japanese woodblock tradition of the early 19th century."

He liked the dark tone of Rackham's gritty realistic drawings and had decided to incorporate that into the film. In Hellboy, the design of the tree growing out of the altar in the ruined abbey off the coast of Scotland where Hellboy was brought over, is actually referred to as a \"Rackham tree\" by the director."

He remained a member of the council until 1937 and served as chairman between 1930 and 1931. He was knighted in 1931 at the end of his term of office. In October 1935 he was granted the freedom of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn. He was also a member of three livery companies of the City of London: the Paviors, Fan Makers and Gardeners.Tasker was an unsuccessful Conservative candidate at the 1923 general election, when he failed to be elected at Bethnal Green North East. Another election was held in 1924, and Tasker stood again, this time at Islington East. In a three-cornered contest, Tasker defeated the sitting Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), Arthur Comyns Carr. Five years later he was defeated when a swing to Labour saw Ethel Bentham, one of his opponents in 1924, take the seat.\nIn 1935 he was selected as Conservative candidate for the Holborn constituency. Duly elected, Tasker was on the right wing of the Conservative Party, and frequently found himself at odds with the wartime National Government.The life of the parliament elected in 1935 was extended to ten years due to the Second World War. Tasker had been confirmed as parliamentary candidate by Holborn Conservative Association in October 1944. However, in February 1945 Max Aitken was adopted as candidate for the upcoming general election. Tasker described the situation as \"quite irregular\" as he had had no intention of withdrawing his candidature. However he did not contest the election, effectively retiring from politics."

In June 1985, he completed a one-year training and evaluation program, qualifying him for assignment as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. His technical responsibilities within the Astronaut Office included extravehicular activity (EVA), the Inertial Upper Stage, Spacelab, and Space Station systems. Lee also served as a spacecraft communicator in the Mission Control Center, as Lead Astronaut Support Person at the Kennedy Space Center, Chief of Astronaut Appearances, Chief of the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch, Chief of the EVA Robotics Branch, and Chief of the EVA Branch. He also worked Space Station assembly issues for the Astronaut Office.\nIn total, during his four space flights, Lee traveled over 13 million miles going around the world 517 times and spending 33 days in orbit. Lee's first shuttle mission was as a mission specialist on STS-30 (May 4\u20138, 1989). This mission involved the launch of the Magellan probe, a Venus-exploration spacecraft and experiments involving life sciences and crystals.\nIn his second flight, mission STS-47, running from September 12\u201320, 1992, Lee was payload commander with overall crew responsibility for the planning, integration, and on-orbit coordination of payload/Space Shuttle activities. This cooperative mission between the United States and Japan included 44 Japanese and U.S. life science and materials processing experiments and the shuttle carried Spacelab-J.  Lee also initiated a unique distinction with STS-47: his wife at that time, Jan Davis, was a mission specialist on the flight, making Lee and Davis the first married couple to be in space at the same time. Lee and Davis had met during training for the flight and had married in secret.  They disclosed their marriage to NASA shortly before the flight, when it was too late to train a substitute.  NASA has since changed the rules and will not allow married astronauts on the same flight.Lee was a mission specialist on his third flight, mission STS-64, running from September 9\u201320, 1994.  During this flight, he logged 6 hours and 51 minutes of EVA to test a self-rescue jetpack, undertook the first untethered spacewalk in 10 years and deployed and retrieved a solar science satellite.  Lee's final flight was STS-82, running from February 11\u201321, 1997.  This was the second Hubble Space Telescope maintenance mission and Lee again served as payload commander. He was a member of one of two spacewalk teams who installed two new spectrometers and eight replacement instruments, as well as replacing insulation patches over three compartments containing key data processing, electronics and scientific instrument telemetry packages. Lee's contribution amounted to three spacewalks totaling 19 hours and 10 minutes of EVA.\nLee was scheduled to fly another mission to the International Space Station in 2000, but was replaced by Robert Curbeam for \"undisclosed reasons\" which news reports claimed related to a falling-out with \"at least one of his superiors at the NASA's Johnson Space Center\".  Lee asked for the decision to be reconsidered, but was not reinstated. He retired from NASA in 2001."

Between 1900 and 1902, he published with Martin Gerlach and Carl Otto Czeschka a three volume portfolio titled Die Quelle (\"The Source\") of elegant graphic designs for such things as tapestries, fabrics, and wallpaper.In 1903, Moser and his colleague Josef Hoffmann founded Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, whose studios and artisans produced a number of aesthetically and functionally designed household goods, including glassware, flatware, silverware, rugs and textiles. In 1904, he created the Apse mosaic and glass windows for the Kirche am Steinhof in Vienna, and designed the decoration of the Medallion House of the Linke Wienzeile Buildings for architect Otto Wagner. \nIn 1905, together with the Klimt group, he separated from the Vienna Secession. The same year, he married Editha (Ditha) Mautner von Markhof, an artist in her own right as well as the daughter to one of Austria's great industry fortunes. Due to internal conflicts and as his plans for reorganising the Werkst\u00e4tte (to cope with financial problems) weren't realised, Moser withdrew from the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte in 1907.\nMoser became ill with throat cancer in 1916. Correspondence with Alfred Roller detailed Moser's despair over who would succeed to his position at the University of Applied Arts Vienna. Moser died on 18 October 1918; he was buried three days later in the Hietzing Cemetery."

This art journal paid great attention to art and design and was managed mainly by Moser, Gustav Klimt and Josef Hoffmann.One of Moser's most prominent designs used in a building (The Steinhof Church) was selected as a main motif of one of the most famous euro collectors coins: the Austrian 100 euro Steinhof Church commemorative coin, minted on 9 November 2005. On the reverse of the coin, the Koloman Moser stained glass window over the main entrance can be seen. In the centre of the window is God the Father seated on a throne. The window is flanked with a pair of bronze angels in Jugendstil style, originally designed by Othmar Schimkowitz.On 3 May 2010, Swann Galleries auctioned the third volume in Moser's three-volume series \"Die Quelle,\" containing 30 sumptuous decorations for flat surfaces, such as tapestries, wallpaper and fabrics, in the original portfolio. Each plate was double-sided, with a colour design on one side and a black-and-white design on the other. It sold for an auction record price of $12,600.To commemorate the centennial of his death, the Museum of Applied Arts Vienna (MAK) honored Moser with one of the most comprehensive solo shows to date (19 December 2018-22 April 2019)."

He was strongly against the Anti-Comintern Pact concluded by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and the Empire of Japan in 1937 and favoured instead Western-Christian unity in Europe (he was, in fact, a member of the Order of Saint John, a German Protestant noblemen's association, to which he had been admitted as a Knight of Honor in 1925 and he had been promoted to Knight of Justice in 1933).

Hassell's main function was to be a liaison between the conservative opposition groups centred about Carl Friedrich Goerdeler and Ludwig Beck (Hassell once ironically called this group \"His Majesty's most loyal opposition\", using the English term) and the younger Kreisau Circle.\nIn 1940, Hassell met the amateur diplomat James Lonsdale-Bryans to discuss a possible pact between Germany and the British Empire. Lonsdale-Bryans proposed that Germany would be allowed control of Europe, and Britain would control the rest of the world. Over the next few years, Hassell used his position in the executive committee of the Central European Economic Congress to discuss with Allied officials what might happen after a possible coup d'\u00e9tat in Germany. He envisaged himself, along with Beck and Johannes Popitz, planning for Germany's post-Hitler internal organization after a successful coup.\nJournal reports by Hassell show that he had specific knowledge of the Holocaust by spring 1943. He denounced the mass gassings as \"unimaginably shameful\".\nDepending on the source, either he or the former ambassador to the Soviet Union, Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, would have become Foreign Minister in the foreseen transitional government. Hassell's offer in 1940 was based on the condition that Britain would let Germany keep almost all of the Nazi\u2019s territorial gains in Europe, including Austria, Sudetenland and Poland. The British saw no reason to agree to a treaty that would be entirely beneficial for Germany alone.However, on 29 July 1944, Hassell was arrested by the Gestapo for his involvement in the 20 July plot, something that he had foreseen. On 8 September, after a two-day trial at the German People's Court (Volksgerichtshof), over which Roland Freisler presided, he was sentenced to death and executed the same day at Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison in Berlin."

Born in Kilkenny, Ireland, O'Reily studied for the priesthood in Dublin.  Upon his ordination in 1869, he migrated to Western Australia, serving as a parish priest in Fremantle, and founding a Catholic newspaper there.  When the Diocese of Port Augusta was established in 1887, Pope Leo XIII named O'Reily as its first bishop.  Concerned about the financial position of the diocese (which had inherited significant debt from the Diocese of Adelaide), he accepted the posting reluctantly.  As bishop, he greatly improved the financial position of the new diocese, reducing its debt by half and earning a reputation as a competent administrator.\nIn 1894, O'Reily was appointed to replace the deceased Christopher Reynolds as Archbishop of Adelaide.  The archdiocese he inherited was burdened with substantial debt, again left over from the old Diocese of Adelaide. Through the sale of church assets and a fundraising campaign, O'Reily was able to eliminate most of the Archdiocese's liabilities while still investing in church infrastructure.  He also actively participated in public discussions relating to education policy at a time when the role of the state in supporting religious education was topical.  O'Reily publicly advocated government assistance for religious schools, stating that it was unfair Catholics paid taxes to support state schools, but received no funding for their own.  In the later years of his life, poor health forced him to spend less time attending to his episcopal duties, and from 1905, he largely retreated from public life.  At his request, Robert Spence was appointed as his coadjutor and successor in 1914, and on 6 July 1915, he died at his house in Adelaide.  O'Reily was highly regarded by many in South Australian society, with Adelaide's daily newspapers praising his character, administrative ability and positive relations with non-Catholics."

        "content": "Following a recommendation from the first plenary council of Australia and New Zealand in 1885, in May 1887 Pope Leo XIII elevated the Diocese of Adelaide to an Archdiocese and metropolitan see.  As a suffragan diocese to Adelaide, the Pope established the rural Diocese of Port Pirie, naming O'Reilly as its inaugural bishop. Upon his appointment, O'Reilly travelled to Adelaide, where he met with the Archbishop of Adelaide Christopher Reynolds and the Cardinal of Sydney Patrick Moran to discuss the formation of the new diocese.  The poor financial state of the Archdiocese made the discussions contentious, with O'Reilly concerned about the amount of debt Port Augusta would inherit from Adelaide. To ensure a sufficiently large population for the new diocese, Moran suggested that its boundaries be altered from those drawn up by the Pope, but Reynolds opposed this plan. Dissatisfied with the outcome of the discussions, O'Reilly decided to travel to Sydney to deliberate further with the Cardinal, prompting Reynolds to write to Moran:\n\n\"If the Holy See would think well of giving the entire colony of South Australia to the care of Dr O'Reily,[sic] I would offer no opposition to it and would gladly enter a monastery and spend my few remaining years in preparation for the end!\"\nOn 27 October, O'Reilly wrote to Pope Leo XIII requesting permission to reverse his decision to accept the appointment to Port Augusta, believing he would be unable to administer a diocese with such significant debt and such a small, impoverished population.  In addition, he wrote, he had no personal wealth to contribute to the finances of the diocese. The concerns O'Reilly raised prompted Cardinal Simeoni of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith to call for an official church inquiry into the financial situation of the South Australian dioceses. The report found a total of almost \u00a338,000 of debt, with the new Port Augusta diocese bearing \u00a318,000. Following the report, O'Reilly's request was refused, and on 1 May 1888, he was consecrated in St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney. Later that year, in an effort to save time while signing documents, O'Reilly removed an \"l\" from his surname.Although the Sisters of St. Joseph operated eight primary schools in the Diocese of Port Augusta, it was without a Catholic high school\u2014boarding or otherwise.  Accordingly, while he was staying in Sydney for his consecration, O'Reily sought to establish a convent for the Sydney-based Sisters of the Good Samaritan in Port Pirie.  At the bishop's expense, the order's Mother-General spent two months in Port Pirie, and once she had found appropriate living quarters, a school was established, teaching over 100 students.  A convent for the sisters was completed in 1890 on the same block as the school.Upon his return to South Australia, O'Reily immediately set about improving the financial situation of the Diocese of Port Augusta. He requested financial assistance from the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, and divided the diocese into fund-raising districts, campaigning for contributions in each of them. With the permission of Archbishop Thomas Carr in Melbourne, O'Reily toured parishes in Victoria asking for funds for his new diocese. By 1893, he had reduced the diocesan debt by half, with his peers describing him as a \"practical, clear-headed man of business\" due to his administrative ability.While Bishop of Port Augusta, O'Reily showed an interest in education policy. He authored a pastoral letter on the matter in March 1889, and the next year gave a speech criticising the lack of government funding for Catholic schools.  According to O'Reily, it was unfair and unjust that Catholics paid taxes to support state schools but received no government support for their own. O'Reily's views on education were frequently cited when the Free Education Bill (which aimed to make state schools free) came before the South Australian Parliament in 1890, but the cost of the scheme meant that the bill was not passed.  Although there was some discussion of funding for religious schools when the bill was reintroduced the next year, these proposals failed to gain significant parliamentary support, and in 1891, the bill was passed without assistance for religious schools.O'Reily suffered a long and serious illness through early 1894 and continued to suffer from migraines throughout the year, forcing him to delegate many of his duties to James Maher (his vicar general) and John Norton (an official consultor) who would later become, respectively, the second and third Bishops of Port Augusta."

Due to poor health, from 1905, O'Reily kept to himself in his house in Glen Osmond, leading to the local press referring to him as the \"Recluse of Glen Osmond\". Increasingly, his episcopal duties were fulfilled by Bishop of Port Augusta John Norton, who would have to visit the more remote parts of O'Reily's see on his behalf.  As he became more frail, O'Reily would ask certain priests to accompany him when he travelled, among whom was the Dominican prior Robert Spence.  When O'Reily requested a coadjutor in 1913, he chose Spence as his first preference for the role. Despite the reluctance of some clergy to the appointment of a religious as Archbishop, Spence was consecrated as coadjutor, with right of succession, in August 1914. O'Reily died on 6 July 1915 at his house in Glen Osmond, and was buried under a large Celtic cross at the West Terrace Cemetery.During his time as Archbishop, O'Reily had formed positive relationships with many senior members of South Australian society, including the Anglican Bishop of Adelaide Nutter Thomas, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia, Samuel Way, who considered him a friend. In an editorial in 1913, The Advertiser praised O'Reily, lauding his administrative abilities and crediting the good relations between Protestants and Catholics in South Australia to his \"broadness of mind and to his quiet determination to avoid all unnecessary controversy.\" Upon his death, The Register gave a glowing editorial, describing him as \"loveable and highly estimable\", a \"hard hitter\" and asserting that, had he not been a religious leader, he could have been \"a leading financier, Imperial legislator or even an eminent military commander.\""

Smith's religious views were, by his own admission, unorthodox for the standards of his age: he believed that the message of Jesus was \"the proclamation of a new social order of human society\", and rejected the \"harsh theologies\" of mainstream Christian churches. \"In my sermons\", he wrote, \"no miracle was required to explain the birth of Jesus or his life and teachings ... His name was to be cherished because He died as a leader of the people, for His principles and in protest against the unjust rulers of His day\". After reading The Communist Manifesto, Smith eventually reached the conclusion that Jesus was a communist.\nSmith's views had not yet developed to this stage in 1917, however, and he joined the social reformist Dominion Labour Party at the end of the First World War. Smith supported the strikers from his pulpit during the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 and opened his church to Brandon civic workers who voted for a parallel strike in their city. As a member of the Brandon Trades and Labour Council, Smith provided extensive logistical support to Brandon's strike committee. He also testified before the Royal Commission on Industrial Relations.Not surprisingly, Smith's labour activities were opposed by more conservative figures in his Methodist church. At a special meeting of the church board held on May 26, 1919, a prominent church member moved that Smith \"be restrained from any further preaching in First Church\". No formal charges were made against him, and the motion was withdrawn. Nonetheless, his role as Brandon's Methodist minister had become untenable. On June 8, he announced the formation of a new People's Church in the city."

He was successful in the 1920 provincial election, defeating Liberal incumbent Stephen Emmett Clement by 604 votes.  Some blamed vote-splitting by the Liberals and Conservatives for his victory.\nFor the next two years, Smith sat with the labour parliamentary group led by Fred Dixon in the legislative opposition.  Unlike other labour members, Smith did not join the Independent Labour Party when the Winnipeg branch of the Dominion Labour Party split in late 1920.  In August 1921, he instead attended a meeting of the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Council which led to the creation of the Canadian Labour Party.  While joining the CLP took Smith on a different path from his co-legislators, he remained a member of the labor parliamentary group.\nLabour's political support in Manitoba had declined somewhat by the 1922 provincial election. Smith lost his seat to John Edmison, who ran as a \"fusion\" candidate of the local Liberals and Conservatives, thus preventing any possible vote-splitting in the Liberal and Conservative camp.\nNo longer receiving a salary as a Methodist minister or Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), Smith experienced financial difficulties in Brandon and decided to return to Ontario.\nHe moved to Ontario in 1923, and immediately started a People's Church in Toronto.\nSmith was also involved in the Forum Committee of the local Labour Temple, and became a prominent member of the Canadian Labour Party in the city and became party president in 1925.  Unlike James Simpson, Smith supported opening the CLP to members of the newly formed Communist Party of Canada."

His membership in the party was confirmed at a small upstairs room at 8 Gerrard Street East in Toronto, where a meeting of the party was held.  He later explained his decision to a Toronto Star reporter by arguing that communism was a part of man's social evolution.  Smith remained a member of the Communist Party for the rest of his life.  Still a prominent figure in Toronto, he often defended the Communist Party against threats from hostile governments.  He became a prominent organizer for the Canadian Labour Defence League across Canada in the 1920s, and served as its general secretary until it was shut down by the Canadian government in 1940.\nHe campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1925 federal election as a candidate of the CLP in the northern Ontario riding of Port Arthur\u2014Thunder Bay.  He finished fourth, with 1,363 votes.  The winner was William Fitzgerald Langworthy of the Conservative Party.  At the time of the election, Smith described his occupation as \"educationalist\".  He ran again in the 1926 election, and finished third with 1,382 votes.  The winner was Conservative Donald James Cowan.\nSmith ran for municipal office in Toronto during this period.  In 1925, he ran for alderman in Ward Seven as a candidate of the Labour Representation Political Association, a broad-tent group aligned with the Canadian Labour Party.  He was defeated, and lost a second time in 1926.  He also ran as a candidate of the Ontario division of the CLP in the 1926 provincial election, receiving 416 votes in Hamilton Centre.  The winner on that occasion was Thomas Jutten of the Ontario Conservative Party. In the 1930 federal election he ran as an independent candidate in Fort William winning 594 votes."

Foxton initially joined the band as lead guitarist (Weller played bass), but the pair switched roles following the departure of guitarist Steve Brookes. During his time with the band Foxton performed lead vocals on several tracks, most notably the singles \"David Watts\" (a cover of a Kinks track) and \"News of the World\", which was his own composition. Foxton also penned a number of other tracks, the most notable being \"Smithers-Jones\", done as a straightforward rock take for the B-side of \"When You're Young\" and later reworked with strings for the Setting Sons album.  After Foxton joined Stiff Little Fingers in 1990 the band would regularly perform the song live.\nWhilst in The Jam, Foxton discovered the new wave band the Vapors and offered them two appearances on the May 1979 tour of The Jam. The band was managed by John Weller, Paul's father. The Vapors enjoyed greater success in the US than The Jam, with the Top 40 single \"Turning Japanese\", but broke up shortly thereafter.\nAfter The Jam broke-up in 1982, Foxton pursued a brief solo career and released the studio album, Touch Sensitive, in 1984. The album's single \"Freak\" became a UK Top 20 hit in 1983. He had other minor UK hits in 1983 and 1984 with the singles \"This Is the Way\" and \"It Makes Me Wonder\", and played in several bands, including Sharp with former Jam member Rick Buckler, before joining Stiff Little Fingers.\nHe stayed with Stiff Little Fingers for 15 years, during which time they recorded five albums, namely, Flags and Emblems, Get a Life, Tinderbox, Hope Street and Guitar and Drum. During his time with the band, he wrote and co-wrote several tracks and, along with lead singer Jake Burns, managed the band for a while after Russel Emmanuel relinquished the role.\nIn 1994, Foxton and Buckler collaborated on Our Story, a biography of their years in The Jam. It was around this time he became a source of fascination for comedians Stewart Lee and Richard Herring on their BBC Radio 1 music shows.\nIn 2006, Foxton toured with Bruce Watson, Mark Brzezicki and Simon Townshend as the Casbah Club. When this band supported the Who in the UK, Foxton encountered Paul Weller backstage for the first time in nearly 25 years.\nIn February 2007, Foxton and Buckler announced they would be touring together again as From the Jam, with members of Buckler's Jam tribute band the Gift. In March 2008, they toured Australia and New Zealand \u2013 a first for Foxton and Buckler. A complete concert (recorded at the London Astoria in December 2007) was released on DVD in 2008 through the London-based indie label Invisible Hands Music.On 5 May 2009, Foxton attended the funeral of Paul Weller's father John, who had been instrumental in The Jam's success. Foxton played bass and contributed backing vocals on the songs \"Fast Car/Slow Traffic\" and \"She Speaks\" included on Weller's solo album, Wake Up the Nation, released in April 2010. On 25 May 2010, at the Royal Albert Hall, Foxton joined Weller onstage for the first time in 28 years, to perform three songs, \"Fast Car/Slow Traffic\", \"The Eton Rifles\" and \"The Butterfly Collector\".\nOn 1 October 2012, Foxton released Back in the Room, his first album in 30 years. It was funded by fans through PledgeMusic and released on Absolute via Universal.

        "content": "Joseph John \"Joe\" Comartin was born on December 26, 1947, in Stoney Point, Ontario, a small Franco-Ontarian community. He was the seventh and youngest child of Emery and Loretto (n\u00e9e Quirk) Comartin. His older siblings were Lucille, Agnes, Rosemary, Alice, Kathleen, and Edward. Emery was a French American born in North Dakota. Emery wandered the Midwestern United States during the Great Depression, eventually settling in Detroit after getting a job there as an autoworker. Loretto was an Irish Canadian from London, Ontario who moved to Detroit to care for her sick aunt. The two met through Detroit's Irish American community and married. Emery continued to work in Detroit, but the family also purchased a plot of land to farm in Stoney Point.Emery died of stomach cancer when Joe was a year old and when Loretto was pregnant with an eighth child, who was named Emery after his father. Following the senior Emery's death, Loretto began teaching at an elementary school to supplement meager social assistance, financial support from family, and charity from the local community. She later remarried to Adelard Gagnon, a car salesman from Belle River, Ontario.Comartin developed an early love for reading as a child, and he often read while in the branches of an apple tree. During his education he often had to work two or three jobs at a time to help support his family, with his first job being at a grocery store in Belle River. Comartin attended F.J. Brennan Catholic High School in Windsor, Ontario. At his mother's urging Comartin originally intended to become a priest, but at 16 he decided that he did not want to be celibate. Instead, he decided he wanted to become a lawyer, believing it to be a similar form of public service. While at Brennan, Comartin was elected the eleventh grade male representative on the student council. He was appointed as the male representative on the school's awards committee after the twelfth grade male representative proved unable to fill the role. The twelfth grade female representative was Comartin's future wife, Maureen Granger. Granger was already in a relationship at the time, and she and Comartin did not begin dating until a few years later. Comartin was elected student president in his final year at Brennan.Following his high school graduation Comartin attended the University of Windsor, where he completed an undergraduate in political science in 1968, and law school in 1971. Unlike most of his older siblings, Comartin was able to attend university because of the creation of the Canada Student Loan Program. While at university Comartin was an engaged student activist; he attended a student strike where he briefly met then-Member of Provincial Parliament Hugh Peacock, and was a founding member of the Windsor chapter of the Canadian Environmental Law Association.Two years after completing law school, Comartin established a private legal practice in Windsor. During this time, he specialised in civil litigation and representing low-income women in family law cases. In the late 1970s, Comartin sued brake manufacturer Bendix on behalf of widow Lucie Dunn to have her husband's death by mesothelioma recognised as a compensable injury.In 1984, Comartin left his private legal practice to become a lawyer for the Windsor branch of the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) and the managing director of its legal services."

        "content": "The Comartin family had traditionally supported the Liberal Party, especially prominent local member Paul Martin Sr. At the encouragement of his sister, Comartin joined the Liberal Party and campaigned for her friend Mark MacGuigan in the 1968 Canadian federal election, in which Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was elected for the first time. Despite his initial support, Comartin quickly grew to dislike Trudeau for his arrogance, and he switched parties to the NDP the next year after concluding they better aligned with his values. Comartin went on to become heavily involved with the regional riding associations of the NDP and Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP).\nIn 1981, Comartin was appointed co-chair of the Mayor's Committee on Services for the Unemployed by Bert Weeks.Following Weeks' retirement, Comartin worked as the campaign manager for Elizabeth Kishkon's successful bid to succeed him in the 1982 Windsor municipal election. Comartin also campaigned for city alderman Howard McCurdy's successful bid to be elected MP for Windsor\u2014Walkerville in the 1984 Canadian federal election. After McCurdy's election, there was a controversy over whether his replacement as city alderman would be appointed or if a by-election would be held. Comartin was considered a contender to replace McCurdy, but ultimately former mayor Michael J. Patrick was appointed instead. Comartin was the ONDP campaign manager for Windsor\u2014Walkerville in 1985 and 1987, working on behalf of unsuccessful candidates Gary Parent and Donna Champagne.While otherwise a supporter, Comartin was highly critical of Leader of the NDP Ed Broadbent's conduct in the 1988 Canadian federal election. Comartin believed that Broadbent had unwisely focused on nationwide campaigning rather than targeting winnable ridings. Comartin also believed that Broadbent had failed to capitalise on the NDP's traditionally protectionist trade policy amidst widespread opposition to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement, which the Liberals had made a major campaign issue. Local NDP MPs Howard McCurdy and Steven Langdon both agreed with Comartin's assessment. Broadbent chose to resign as Leader shortly after the election, and both McCurdy and Langdon ran to replace him in the 1989 New Democratic Party leadership election. McCurdy and Langdon's rivalry as leadership candidates was exacerbated by the fact that they came from neighbouring ridings and had to compete for support in their home county. Comartin supported McCurdy, who made a surprisingly poor showing of fifth place on the first ballot of the leadership convention. On the second ballot, McCurdy withdrew and endorsed Langdon. Following McCurdy's withdrawal Comartin supported Langdon, even after McCurdy changed his endorsement to Audrey McLaughlin, the eventual winner, on the third ballot.In the lead-up to the 1990 Ontario general election, Donna Champagne surprisingly chose not to run again. Champagne endorsed the relatively unknown Wayne Lessard, who became the ONDP nominee in Windsor\u2014Walkerville in her stead. Comartin campaigned for Lessard, but was out of the country for part of the election season. Before leaving the country, Comartin predicted that the ONDP would do about as well as it had in the previous election, and expected the party to win about 17 seats in the Legislative Assembly. After returning to Canada, Comartin found that support for the party had surged, and the ONDP went on to form government for the first time in Ontarian history. Leader of the ONDP Bob Rae became Premier of Ontario. In Windsor\u2014Walkerville, Lessard defeated Liberal incumbent Mike Ray.\nComartin declined to run for mayor in the 1991 Windsor municipal election.In 1992, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made his second attempt at constitutional reform, known as the Charlottetown Accord. Approval of the Accord was subject to a nationwide referendum, with Canada's three major parties, the Progressive Conservatives, the Liberals, and the New Democrats all supporting its ratification. Comartin was made campaign manager for the 'Yes' campaign in Windsor, and directed all three parties' riding associations in the area. Despite massive institutional support, Windsor voted against ratifying the Accord by a nearly two-to-one margin.Comartin did a great deal of lobbying on behalf of Windsor's unions to convince the Rae Government to build Ontario's first casino in Windsor. Comartin's efforts were supported by Dave Cooke, a fellow Windsorite and a senior member of Rae's cabinet. The lobbying was a success, resulting in the eventual construction of Caesars Windsor. Comartin was appointed to the Ontario Casino Corporation (OCC) board of directors in 1993.Rae's ONDP government was defeated in a landslide in the 1995 Ontario general election by the Progressive Conservatives, led by Mike Harris. Shortly after being elected, the Harris Government removed Comartin from his position on the board of the OCC before his term had expired, which was widely seen as politically motivated. The removal caused an uproar in Windsor, as it deprived the city of any representation on the board of the OCC despite having (at the time) the only casino in the province."

        "content": "Having grown up without a father and being especially aware of the strain that put on a family, Comartin had delayed any political aspirations until after his children were grown. Comartin ran for MP in his home riding of Windsor\u2014St. Clair in the 1997 Canadian federal election. Comartin campaigned on job creation and expanding healthcare coverage against Liberal incumbent Shaughnessy Cohen, who was considered vulnerable after a personal finance scandal in which she defaulted on her debt. Other notable candidates included Mayor of Tecumseh Harold Downs and national party treasurer Bruck Easton for the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties respectively. Despite the scandal and frequent appearances on his behalf by Leader of the NDP Alexa McDonough, Comartin was defeated, placing second to Cohen. The 1997 election was also marred by personal tragedy; Comartin's mother died in the first week of the campaign, with her second husband having predeceased her seven years earlier, and in the week following the campaign, Comartin's youngest son Adam was in a motorcycle accident which left his right arm permanently paralyzed.After Cohen's sudden death in office, Comartin ran in the 1999 by-election to replace her. Comartin's main opponent was city councillor Rick Limoges, who defeated Cohen's widower, Jerry Cohen, for the Liberal nomination. While the by-election was mainly considered a competition between Comartin and Limoges, Bruck Easton was once again fielded as the candidate of the Progressive Conservatives, while Reform nominated mortgage broker and former magician Scott Cowan. Comartin's campaign manager Joe MacDonald was assigned to him by the NDP. MacDonald was a well-known party insider and campaign manager. Comartin ultimately lost by less than one hundred votes to Limoges in what was initially expected to be a Liberal landslide. Besides a general decline in Liberal popularity, it was speculated that the closeness of the race was in part because of high ticket sales in Windsor for an anticipated Detroit Tigers game happening on the same day. The game may have deflated voter turnout to the detriment of Limoges. Comartin later claimed that MacDonald had not believed that he had a chance of winning and had not worked as hard as he could have because of it. MacDonald denied the allegation, and charged that the problems with the campaign were because of interference by Comartin's family.Comartin challenged Limoges again the next year with environmental protection as his main issue. The rematch was very similar to the previous year, with it being mainly considered a competition between Comartin and Limoges, and with Bruck Easton appearing yet again as the Progressive Conservative candidate. Since the by-election, the Reform Party had rebranded as the Canadian Alliance in anticipation of a merger with the Progressive Conservatives. The Alliance nominated autoworker Phil Pettinato as their candidate. In their second bout, Comartin narrowly defeated Limoges. Besides the strong support expected from progressives and union members, Comartin also benefitted from conservatives who strategically voted for him in the hopes of harming the ruling Liberals. Comartin's victory was attributed to the conservative strategic vote.Through his victory, Comartin became the first New Democrat to be elected in Ontario in ten years, and the first New Democrat to represent an Ontario riding in seven; Michael Breaugh had won a by-election in Oshawa in 1990, but had been defeated with the NDP's nine other Ontario MPs in the 1993 Canadian federal election. Shortly after being elected, Comartin was appointed as his party's critic for the environment.Following the September 11 attacks, Comartin caused controversy by opposing direct military intervention to assist the United States in its invasion of Afghanistan. He did, however, support greatly expanding the Canadian military budget in order to properly meet pre-existing commitments.In 2002, Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray of Windsor West was removed in a cabinet shuffle by Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Instead of serving out the rest of his term, Gray decided to resign from parliament to become Canadian Chair of the International Joint Commission. In the ensuing by-election, Comartin supported the campaign of city councillor Brian Masse, who went on to win Gray's old seat. Masse became the NDP caucus' second Ontario MP after Comartin, and the NDP would go on to control both of Windsor's federal ridings for the next seventeen years. Comartin and Masse had a close working relationship, and were nicknamed \"The Twindsors.\""

He began teaching political science at the University of Windsor in 2016.Comartin described President Donald Trump as erratic, and was concerned that his policies would damage the United States-Canadian trade relationship, the ease of commuting across the border to work, and the ease of border crossing more generally.Comartin was critical of Tom Mulcair's decision to stay on temporarily as Leader of the NDP after being removed in a leadership review instead of resigning and appointing an interim leader ahead of the 2017 New Democratic Party leadership election. No longer bound by the impartiality expected from being House Leader, Comartin formally endorsed Niki Ashton in her second bid for leadership. Ashton placed third out of a field of four, behind runner-up Charlie Angus and winner Jagmeet Singh.\nIn 2018, Comartin was approached by the Trudeau Government to see if he was interested in replacing Douglas George as the Consul General in Detroit. Comartin was surprised he was offered the position given his age and lack of interest in the position, and assumed that he was approached because of his closeness with the auto industry. While initially hesitant to take the position, Comartin ultimately accepted in order to facilitate an expansion of the auto industry in Windsor following the ratification of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) His term began on October 29, 2018.\nThe Trudeau Government assigned Comartin three major priorities for his term: oversee the conclusion of the then-ongoing negotiations of CUSMA, settle an ongoing steel and aluminum tariff dispute with the United States, and monitor the ongoing construction of the Gordie Howe International Bridge. Comartin also had a personal interest in encouraging American tourism toward Windsor, particularly for its casino and wine industries.Comartin described his work as 80% meeting with American politicians and corporate executives, and 20% administrative work, with a majority of the administrative work being dedicated to trade and commerce between Canada and the United States.Comartin was supportive of Canadian automotive technology companies attending the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.Near the end of Comartin's term as Consul General, Freedom Convoy protestors blockaded the Ambassador Bridge connecting Windsor and Detroit. Comartin testified at the Public Order Emergency Commission, which investigated Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's use of the Emergencies Act to disperse the protestors. Comartin reported to the inquiry that there was great concern in American political circles that the different branches of the Canadian government seemed unable to work together to remove the blockade prior to the use of the Emergencies Act, resulting in billions of dollars in lost revenue from stopped international commerce.Comartin's term ended on July 28, 2022. By the end of his term, CUSMA had been ratified. Likewise, the steel and aluminum tariff dispute had concluded, for which Comartin took credit. The Gordie Howe Bridge is expected to open in 2024.\nUpon his retirement, Comartin noted that he had had a particularly good working relationship with governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Eric Holcomb of Indiana. He was succeeded as Consul General by trade specialist Colin Bird."

He supports giving the riding associations and other party-aligned grassroots organisations much more influence in setting party policy.In the early 2000s the NDP was ideologically split. The right wing of the party supported the Third Way trend set by Tony Blair, which had been emulated by Alexa McDonough. The left wing of the party formed the New Politics Initiative (NPI) faction, which pushed for further left policies, the abolition of the NDP, and the following creation of a new leftist party. Like Jack Layton, Comartin was part of the centre-left of the party, which was sympathetic to the NPI but not affiliated with it."

He has also studied Roman and Mongolian military history. He occasionally drinks beer.Comartin's serious nature has been frequently commented on. Shortly before her retirement, Leader of the NDP Alexa McDonough recommended that Comartin should smile more, stating \"He's got this sort of deadly earnestness about him.\" Comartin was described in a profile as someone who is \"cool in the spotlight, rarely misspeaks and eschews the backslapping charm expected of many politicians...too decent a guy, to a fault [and] non-plussed with the pomp and politicking of Ottawa.\" Windsor Star journalist Gord Henderson described him as an \"intense, ramrod stiff New Democrat, a guy who only cracks a smile at gunpoint and [only] provided it's loaded...\"Comartin dislikes Twitter. When first asked if he would be creating a Twitter profile, Comartin replied that \"he couldn't fathom devoting lots of his time telling people trivial things about his life in 140 characters or less.\" During the 2011 election he created a Twitter account which was managed by his staff and later deleted."

In 2001 he broke the age record for gaining a General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), the English academic qualification usually taken at age 16, for which he sat the examinations aged five. In 2003 he became the youngest person ever to gain an A* grade at GCSE, also for Mathematics.In October 2010, when Fernandez began studying the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos aged 15 years and 3 months, he was the youngest Cambridge University undergraduate since William Pitt the Younger in 1773.Fernandez believes it was his exceptional environment rather than exceptional nature, that enabled him to achieve his academic successes. \"Everything I achieved is because of my education and the opportunities I had. And the big part of my story is that I never went to school. My parents never believed in the official education system.\" In a 2020 interview with Raidio Teilifis Eireann he stated his opinion that a large number of people could achieve at the same level if they had the same opportunities as he did, and that those opportunities \"would have to start at a very young age\", such as at two years old.Starting in 2000 (aged five) Fernandez had several sequences published in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the number theory database established by Neil Sloane. Since 2017, he has had more than 20 mathematical research articles published in peer-reviewed international journals.Television work featuring Fernandez has included an appearance as a \"Person of the Week\" on Frank Elstner's talk show on German TV in 2001, and an appearance on Terry Wogan\u2019s and \nGaby Roslin's The Terry and Gaby Show on British TV in 2003, when he beat mathematics popularizer Johnny Ball in a live mental arithmetic contest, successfully extracting the fifth roots of several large integers.\nIn September 2018, having completed master's and doctoral degrees at the University of Cambridge, Fernandez joined the faculty of the Eastern Mediterranean University in Northern Cyprus as an assistant professor of mathematics, where in 2022 he became an associate professor. His main research areas are in fractional calculus and analytic number theory.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Charell was born as Erich Karl L\u00f6wenberg in Breslau. He was the first child of Jewish parents Markus L\u00f6wenberg and Ida Korach. He also had a sister, Betti, who was born in 1886, and a younger brother named Ludwig, who was born in 1889 and later became Charell's manager.\nCharell studied dance in Berlin. He was discovered, according to his own account, by the press in 1913 during a performance of the ballet-pantomime Venezianische Abenteuer eines jungen Mannes by playwright Karl Vollm\u00f6ller in a production of director Max Reinhardt at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin. He founded his own company, the Charell-Ballett, and toured Europe during and after the World War I. The musical director of his company was the young Friedrich Hollaender (later a famous film composer.) In two silent movies, Paul Leni's Prince Cuckoo (1919) and Richard Oswald's Figures of the Night (1920) he demonstrated his brilliance as an actor. Reinhardt appointed Charell as assistant stage manager for the tour production of Vollm\u00f6ller's The Miracle in New York in 1923. After his return to Germany in 1924, Charell and his brother Ludwig were offered to take over the management of the Gro\u00dfes Schauspielhaus in Berlin, which belonged to Reinhardt's theatre empire, the so called Reinhardt B\u00fchnen.\nIn 1924 Charell presented his first revue, An Alle. He managed to engage the \"Tiller Girls\", an internationally famous girl group from London. His aim was to mix German operetta with exotic ingredients such as jazz, \"negro music\" and \"the most enchanting Dancing-Girls with divine legs\", in order to show that revue made in Berlin could be \"as contemporary as the jazz band, that turns the Siegmund-jodeling and Siegfried-screaching to laughter\" and is \"as modern as Mozart or the mini-automobile\", as Charell's personal friend and PR genius Alfred Flechtheim phrased it in the 1924 article \"Vom Ballet zur Revue\" in the magazine Der Querschnitt. \"Charell wants us to witness the many different facets from all around the world\".This show was followed by the revues F\u00fcr Dich (1925) and Von Mund zu Mund (1926), which were arranged by composer Ralph Benatzky and contained music by Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern and many others.\nAfter the series of revues, Charell began adapting classic operettas such as The Mikado, Wie einst im Mai, Madame Pompadour and Die lustige Witwe and turned them into modern jazzy revue operettas, claiming that he needed a plot line for his show, that had been missing in the pure revues before. A few years later, he decided to create his very own operettas with composer Ralph Benatzky. Together they wrote the trilogy of historical revue-operettas, which made Charell famous to this day: Casanova (1928), Die drei Musketiere (1929) and The White Horse Inn (Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6\u00dfl, 1930). Especially The White Horse Inn was one of the most successful creations of Charell's career. In the following years he himself staged the show in London (1931), Paris (1932) and New York (1936), where each production was newly conceived, the script translated differently, and new music and instrumentation were added in some parts.\nMany actors and singers, such as Marlene Dietrich, Joseph Schmidt, Max Hansen and Camilla Spira, who all became famous later, first appeared in major roles in Charell productions. Charell also discovered the boy group Comedian Harmonists and presented them for the first time in Casanova at the Gro\u00dfe Schauspielhaus. The reaction of the international press was positive, the New York Times noting that \"Erik Charell seems to have done it again. 'Casanova', his latest operetta production at the Grosses Schauspielhaus, is filling this huge circus to its stylized rafters\". \nAfter this string of stage successes, Charell moved on to the new and innovative genre of sound film operetta. In 1931, Universum Film AG (Ufa) producer Erich Pommer invited Charell to direct Der Kongre\u00df tanzt, (sets by Ernst Stern, music by Werner Richard Heymann), one of the most successful films of the early era of sound film, with one review in the New York Times saying that \"[it] is a stupendous pictorial film. [...] it is [...] an exceptional film entertainment. The director, Erik Charell, is the Ziegfeld of the German musical comedy stage\" and another noting that \"It is a charming spectacle of Vienna in 1814, filled with tuneful melodies that one likes to remember and blessed with pleasing light comedy\". The international success of Der Kongre\u00df tanzt led to an engagement in Hollywood, where Charell directed the movie Caravan, again with sets by Ernst Stern and music by Werner Richard Heymann.\nWhen the Nazis took over in January 1933, the Ufa immediately annulled their contract with Charell because of his Jewish descent. They also cancelled all plans for two further contractually agreed upon film projects, one a film operetta based on the Odyssey with Hans Albers in the male lead. Three years later a German court even sentenced Charell to return the 26.000 Reichsmark, which had been paid to him as an advance.\nWhen Caravan flopped in the US and internationally, his Hollywood career and all other American film projects came to an immediate halt. The New York Times noted \"If lyric loveliness and photographic charm were all a picture needed to keep an audience enthralled, Mr. Charell could be toasted in good tokay this morning, and 'Caravan' could be applauded until the bottle is dry. But the sober fact is that the new film is an exceptionally tedious enterprise\". One of the cancelled projects was a film about ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). It would have been an interesting project, since Charell in his dancing days was often compared by the German press to Nijinsky.\nIn 1936, Charell staged a successful Broadway production of White Horse Inn. The New York Times noted that it \"involves mountain scenery and hotel architecture, costumes beautiful and varied enough to bankrupt a designer's imagination, choruses that can do anything from the hornpipe to a resounding slap-dance, grand processionals with royalty loitering before the commoners, a steamboat, a yacht, a char-\u00e0-banc, four real cows and a great deal more of the same. Indeed, the enthusiasm with which 'White Horse Inn' has been created has virtually transformed the enormous Center Theatre into a Tyrol village\". The Daily Mirror mentioned that \"it is difficult to give you an idea of the immensity of 'White Horse Inn'. It is gargantuan. It is the Queen Mary of extravaganzas. [...] It boasts acres of settings, hundreds of performers. It is a grand and glittering sight for the eyes.\" There was even talk of a film version with Eddie Cantor as the head waiter. (Warner Brothers were co-producers of the Broadway staging.)\nSpurred by the success of White Horse Inn, Charell adapted Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream as a jazz operetta and presented it as Swinging the Dream on Broadway at the Center Theatre in 1939. It was a daring and innovative production, because Charell used only black actors and singers, including Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Maxine Sullivan, Moms Mabley, Dorothy Dandridge and Butterfly McQueen. Furthermore, the stage sets were based on Walt Disney motifs. Music was written for the production by Jimmy van Heusen but songs included in the show came from the greatest African-American composers and songwriters in jazz: W. C. Handy, Thomas \"Fats\" Waller, Count Basie and many others.Benny Goodman conducted his own sextet and the choreography was by Agnes de Mille. But the production closed after only 13 performances, mainly because white Broadway audiences (and, perhaps more importantly, racist reviewers) of the time were not \"ready\" for an all-black cast. A review in the New York Times described the show as a \"negro carnival\", noting that \"between Shakespeare and Goodman, Goodman wins\".  It's likely that the timing of the opening had a great deal to do with the lack of success of \"Swingin'\"; by opening night - 29 November 1939 - World War II was in full swing; it would have been difficult for audiences to enjoy an escapist musical fantasy while events in Europe were becoming more and more horrifying with every passing hour.  [A re-creation of the show was streamed online during the COVID-19 pandemic in a collaboration between the Royal Shakespeare Company and Young Vic of London, England and Theatre for a New Audience of New York, New York on 9 January 2021.]\nAfter the war, Charell returned to Europe. In Munich he had a big success with the musical comedy Feuerwerk (music by Paul Burkhard) at the Staatstheater am G\u00e4rtnerplatz. The song O mein Papa became an international hit. In the 1950s, Charell created a stage version of Der Kongre\u00df tanzt, which was performed in France, but the French public was not enthusiastic. His two big film productions were The White Horse Inn with Nazi operetta star Johannes Heesters in 1952, and Fireworks with Lilli Palmer and the young Romy Schneider in 1954.\nAfter failing to write a sequel to The White Horse Inn with his original librettist Robert Gilbert, Charell spend most of his time of the 1960s buying and selling art. Together with his brother Ludwig he owned a collection of Toulouse-Lautrec-lithographs, which was exhibited in Canada in 1953 and in other major museums of the world.\nIn 1969 he received the German movie prize, the Filmband in Gold, for his \"excellent works and outstanding contributions to the history of the German movie\".\nHe died on 15 July 1974 in Munich and was cremated on the Eastern cemetery. In his obituary it says: \"28 friends gave him the last farewell in the city, to which he had a special love. A movie producer spoke to his memories, and to honour this charmer, who consciously and prudently managed his graceful talents, the triumph march of Verdi's opera 'Aida' sounded across the cemetery\". The urn was interred in a cemetery in Gr\u00fcnwald near Munich. Charell's partner Friedrich Zanner and Dr. Wolf Schwarz, a lawyer and friend, were appointed to manage the estate and the personal property.His collection of Lautrec-lithographs was sold by Sotheby's in 1978.\nThe Schwules Museum Berlin dedicated an exhibition to Charell and his work from 7 July to 27 September 2010. It was curated by Kevin Clarke.\nOn 18 November 2015, Friedrichstadt-Palast Berlin inaugurated a memorial at Friedrichstra\u00dfe 107 dedicated to the theatre's founders, Max Reinhardt, Hans Poelzig and Erik Charell."

        "content": "When Charell visited New York for the first time, working at the Century Theatre for Max Reinhardt, he was impressed and inspired by the American revues, especially the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway. He decided, upon his return to Berlin, to combine European operetta music with the music and ideas of the American music theatre, to create a more 'cosmopolitan German' style. He established a revue style in which \"word, sound, image, costume, colour, the art of illumination [work together] as a single rousing burning mirror\". Charell wanted to make \"modern\" pieces and bring them to Germany to challenge the conservative mindset, which still prevailed in Europe after the First World War (\"Germany is still suffering from the blockage. After being isolated from the rest of the world for ten years, it finally needs to breathe freely and realize what was going on in those ten long years, not only in science [...], but also in things, which take a look on the bright side of life\"). His way of using contemporary syncopated music \u2013 from the German charts and the USA (the first European performance of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue took place within Charell's first revue, An Alle) \u2013,the risqu\u00e9 jokes and the inclusion of attractive boy groups (dancing and singing) in addition to the then standard heterosexual display of female nudity were all new to the Berlin theatre scene. He also presented renowned Lesbian stars such as Claire Waldoff to draw in additional crowds.\nEspecially the sexually provocative sketches between the songs made his reviews and revue operettas famous. The comedians Claire Waldoff and Wilhelm Bendow were hired to perform slapstick and dialectic humour similar of the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Karl Valentin. They provided an ironic view on different topics and cheeky 'hidden' references to e.g. sex practices of heteros and homosexuals. Besides, there were also jokes about sexuality woven into the song texts by the lyricists. This made the heterosexual audience laugh, especially those who understood the insider jokes, and it especially catered to the homosexual crowd. Bendow was particularly famous for his camp acting and double entendres. Furthermore, on Charell used sexually suggestive imagery, like in Von Mund zu Mund in which ancient Roman soldiers were portrayed semi-naked holding lances and swords.Charell revolutionized the German musical theatre by developing the idea of 'staged nudity' further than had been standard until then. He discovered modern female chorus lines in New York and was the first to bring them to Berlin, where they fuelled his stunning success. When the other theatre managers tried to copy Charell and also hired female chorus groups, they presented them as nude as possible. While the fight over who had the 'most naked' women in Berlin was raging, Charell's staging of nudity moved into a wholly different direction: when the audience became tired and bored of a straightforward display of naked bodies (\"Yes, we are all pretty tired of those flesh exhibitions. The audience is sated with thighs. Not to mention, how fed up we are of the mass display of female bosoms.\"), he started to artfully arrange the nudity. Charell wanted \"to reawaken aesthetic feelings\" in the spectator \"by artistic composition\".\nIn addition and as a contrast to the omnipresent female nudity, Charell also hired boy groups, e.g. the Tyrolean dancers, the \"Schuhplattler and Watschent\u00e4nzer\", for Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6ssl, or the \"Jackson\" and the \"Sunshine Boys\". In the first case homoeroticism is quite obvious, the tabloid newspaper BZ am Mittag noting \"juicy guys in leather trousers, who slap each other in time. [...] My God, they have the right cheeks for it!\"\nCharell also used famous male sex symbols in his operettas, like Alfred Jerger, Max Hansen and Siegfried Arno, the latter doing a famous striptease in The Three Musketeers when comparing his battle wounds with the others, critic Erich Urban noted that \"when [Arno] unveils his perforated body to Hansen [...] the whole theatre screams and gasp, not just the upper balconies\". Im wei\u00dfen R\u00f6ssl contains a similar scene, in which Arno presents himself as a \"gorgeous bathing beauty\" and undresses, before plunging into the Wolfgangsee.\nEven though Charell's revues were inspired by America and England, this kind of nudity and sexual liberation was only found in Berlin during the Roaring Twenties. After 1933, the Nazis suppressed such most of the sexual freedom in operetta, because it was seen as \"Jewish\" and \"degenerate\". Unfortunately, 1945 the German operetta scene never returned to the liberated ideals of the 1920s and adapted many of the famous shows from that era to fit the new 'innocent' style of the post-war period. This eventually led Charell to leave the theatre and film business entirely, and focus on his art collection instead."

A squadron of the 8th Cavalry Regiment reached the bridge just moments after Japanese soldiers had finished preparing it for demolition. As the two sides opened fire on one another, the Japanese lit the fuse leading to the carefully placed explosives. Without hesitation, Lt.

During those days there was a severe scarcity of women actors in films; this was evident in the paychecks that the Mishras received when they went to Nasik for the shooting. While Ram Prasad Mishra was hired on a salary of Rs. 150 per month, Leela Mishra was offered Rs. 500 per month. However, as they fared poorly in front of the camera, their contracts were cancelled.The next opportunity that came their way was an offer to work in the movie Bhikarin, which was being produced by a company owned by the Maharaja of Kolhapur. However, Leela Mishra lost out on this opportunity too, as the role required her to put her arms round the actor (who was not her husband) while delivering a dialogue, which she point-blank refused to do.\nShe faced a similar problem while working in another film titled Honhaar. She was cast opposite Shahu Modak as a heroine, and was supposed to hug and embrace him, which she again refused steadfastly. Since the company was legally in a weak position, they couldn't turn her out of the film, which proved to be a blessing in disguise for her. She was offered Modak's mother's role in the film and it clicked instantly. This opened the doors for her to play mother roles at the young age of 18."

        "content": "Guillaume or William de Malveisin (also, modern forms Malvoisin or Mauvoisin) was Chancellor of Scotland, Bishop of Glasgow (1199/1200\u20131202) and then Bishop of St. Andrews (1202\u20131238).\nWilliam Malveisin was probably born in France. It is possible that he was the son of the nephew of the Count of Brittany, however it is much more likely that he came from a family of the name based on the lower Seine valley. William was likely the nephew of Samson de Malveisin, Archbishop of Rheims from 1140 to 1161. In this context, William's career can come as no surprise.\nWilliam appears in Scottish records for the first time in the 1180s, appearing as a royal clerk. In 1193, the royal patronage he had earned brought him his first known ecclesiastical post, as Archdeacon of Lothian. He was made the king's Chancellor probably on 8 September 1199, and was elected to the Bishopric of Glasgow in October the same year. He was consecrated at Lyon by Renaud de Forez, Archbishop of Lyon, in September 1200. However, two years later in the same month, he was translated to the higher ranking Bishopric of St. Andrews. William got into a little trouble for exercising his episcopal powers before his episcopate had been confirmed by the Pope, then Innocent III; a charge was brought against him by one of his canons, a man named Eustace. The charge was heard by the Papal legate, John of Salerno, who held a council at Perth in December 1201, before leaving for business in Ireland. Legate John once again visited Scotland on his way back from Ireland, staying for more than fifty days at Melrose. However, nothing came of the charge.Walter Bower relates that William received the permission of King William to visit his relatives in France. This was perhaps between May 1212 and Spring 1213, when Bishop William disappears from the records. When not visiting home, Bishop William, like most other Bishops of St. Andrews, was keen to expand the power of the bishopric. In one instance, when Gille \u00cdsu, the hereditary priest of Wedale (Peebleshire) died, he took the opportunity to absorb the church into his diocese. Bishop William enjoyed good relations with the native Scottish clerical order of his diocese, the people \"qui Keledei vulgariter appellantur\" (commonly called C\u00e9li D\u00e9, Gaelic for \"Vassals of God\"). At some point between 1206 and 1216, and again in 1220, he managed to obtain absolution from the sentence of excommunication bestowed on the C\u00e9li D\u00e9 by the Pope; it may be that Bishop William's patronage ensured the opening priesthoods of its church, the Church of St Mary on the Rock at St. Andrews, to non-native clergy, to men such as Henry de Weles, and encouraged the order to consolidate its position vis-\u00e0-vis the papacy.According to the arguments of D.D.R. Owen, William was not only a bishop, but an author of Arthurian romance. The author of the romance known to us as the Roman de Fergus identifies himself as Guillaume le Clerc, or William the Clerk. In the words of Owen, \"it is most reasonable to keep our eyes open for any French clerk by the name of William (Guillaume)\" in the period concerned, and Owen uses textual and contextual evidence to show that William de Malveisin is one of the most likely known candidates.Bishop William died at a place called \"Inchemordauch\" (Inis Muiredaich), one of the Bishopric's manors, in 1238, probably on 9 July. The next consecrated Bishop of St. Andrews was David de Bernham."

Also at this time, Edmund Burke, the Irish statesman and philosopher, became his private secretary and would remain a lifelong friend, political ally and advisor until Rockingham's death from influenza in 1782.\nRockingham's administration was dominated by the American issue.

It is much too probable that the power and influence of the Crown will increase rapidly. We live at the period when for the first time since the Revolution, the power and influence of the Crown is held out, as the main and chief and only support of Government. If we...do not exert now, we may accelerate the abject state to which the Constitution may be reduced\". On 24 May 1771 Benjamin Franklin arrived from the Rectory of Thornhill, where he had stayed with the Rev. John Michell, vicar to Rockingham's kinsman, fellow leading politician and keen advocate of colonists' rights Sir George Savile. Rockingham wrote to Augustus Keppel on 3 November 1779, saying that he believed the war against America could not be won, that the government was corrupt but not unpopular, and that the longer this continued the greater the danger to the liberties and the constitution of Britain: \"Perhaps a total change of men and measures, & system in the Government: of this country might have effect on the councils of some foreign countries...who might think that it was no longer a Court system to combat, but that the whole nation would unite & make the utmost efforts\".Rockingham was recruited to hunt down the Cragg Vale Coiners.

The ministerial changes of 1782 involved a more extensive upheaval among office-holders than any since 1714, virtually replacing one administration with another drawn from opposition\".\nRockingham's second term was short-lived, for Lord Rockingham died fourteen weeks later at the beginning of July from an influenza epidemic. He was replaced as prime minister by Lord Shelburne, who was more reluctant to accept the total independence of America and proposed a form of Dominion status, but by April 1783 he succeeded in securing peace with America and this feat remains his legacy.Rockingham was buried in the Strafford family vault in York Minster in Yorkshire."

Burke wrote to Fitzwilliam on 3 July 1782: \"You are Lord Rockingham in every thing. ... I have no doubt that you will take it in good part, that his old friends, who were attached to him by every tie of affection, and of principle, and among others myself, should look to you, and should not think it an act of forwardness and intrusion to offer you their services\".:\u200a383\u200a On 7 July 150 supporters of Rockingham met at Fitzwilliam's house and decided to withdraw support for Lord Shelburne's administration. The old Rockingham party fragmented, with Fox and the Duke of Portland leading a coalition of Whigs. The Whig party further split over the French Revolution, with Burke writing to Fitzwilliam on 4 January 1797: \"As to our old friends, they are so many individuals, not a jot more separated from your Lordship, than they are from one another. There is no mutual affection, communication, or concert between them\".:\u200a385\u200aThe Whig historian Thomas Babington Macaulay was an admirer of Rockingham and his Whig faction:\n\nThey were men worthy to have charged by the side of Hampden at Chalgrove, or to have exchanged the last embrace with Russell on the scaffold in Lincoln's Inn Fields. They carried into politics the same high principles of virtue which regulated their private dealings, nor would they stoop to promote even the noblest and most salutary ends by means which honour and probity condemn. Such men were Lord John Cavendish, Sir George Savile, and others whom we hold in honour as the second founders of the Whig party, as the restorers of its pristine health and energy after half a century of degeneracy. The chief of this respectable band was the Marquess of Rockingham, a man of splendid fortune, excellent sense, and stainless character. He was indeed nervous to such a degree that, to the very close of his life, he never rose without great reluctance and embarrassment to address the House of Lords. But, though not a great orator, he had in a high degree some of the qualities of a statesman. He chose his friends well; and he had, in an extraordinary degree, the art of attaching them to him by ties of the most honourable kind. The cheerful fidelity with which they adhered to him through many years of almost hopeless opposition was less admirable than the disinterestedness and delicacy which they showed when he rose to power."

She subsequently appeared frequently on television in guest roles, and appeared in the 1981 CBS TV remake of Jacqueline Susann's Valley of the Dolls, as Neely O'Hara. She was on WLS-TV's 1979 special \"You're Never Too Old\" recorded at Marriott's Great America in Gurnee, Illinois.Hartman's breakthrough as an actress came in 1982 when she began appearing on the prime time drama Knots Landing, playing rock singer Ciji Dunne. Her character engaged in romances with the characters played by Ted Shackelford and Michael Sabatino. Hartman was popular with audiences, and when Ciji was murdered off-screen in 1983, there was a public uproar. As a solution, Hartman was brought back on the show as Cathy Geary, also a singer, who later marries an unbalanced televangelist played by a young Alec Baldwin. Hartman remained with the show until 1986, when she was released due to budget cuts and because the show's writers felt there were no further storylines for her character. During her time on the series, she appeared in the film Where the Boys Are '84 produced by Allan Carr. She also sang the film's theme song.\nHartman recorded four solo albums between 1976 and 1987 \u2013 two for Kirshner Records, one for RCA Records, and one for Atlantic Records. Her most notable song is \"If Love Must Go\", which she performed on various television shows like Solid Gold and The Merv Griffin Show. Despite additional contributions from successful songwriters and producers including Jeff Barry, Dobie Gray, Bryan Adams, Rick Springfield, Will Jennings, and Holly Knight, the albums were not commercially successful.

In 1909, following high school graduation, he moved to what was then known as the District of Alaska, settling in Cordova.  After many years of working for the Copper River and Northwestern Railway, he passed the bar and began working as a lawyer.\nTaylor would move to Kodiak briefly during the 1940s before settling in Fairbanks, where he would live for the remainder of his life.\nAs a lawyer, he focused on criminal defense law. In one case in 1948, he represented a young civilian employee at Ladd Field named Joseph Vogler, who sought an injunction against University Bus Lines and its owners Paul and Flora Greimann.  Vogler had a public, years-long feud with the Greimanns, centered on their company's practice of having their vehicles straddle the center line of the narrow Cushman Street Bridge.  That bridge, constructed in 1917, was later replaced with a four-lane bridge.\nIn other cases, he faced then-U.S. Attorney Ted Stevens, who later became another important Alaska politician.  Stevens served as a Republican senator from Alaska from 1968 to 2009, making him the fourth most senior Senator and most senior Republican.\nIn addition to his professional career, Taylor served multiple terms in Alaska Territorial House of Representatives (from 3rd District 1933\u20131934, 1945\u20131946 and from 4th District 1949\u20131950, 1955\u20131958).  He served from each of the communities he lived in during his years in Alaska (Cordova, then Kodiak, then Fairbanks).  He was a delegate to the State Constitutional Convention (1955\u20131956), serving as one of a handful of delegates elected from the territory at-large.\nAfter Alaska became the 49th State, Taylor was among the first members of the Alaska House of Representatives. He was selected by Democratic majority to serve as the first speaker of the Alaska House. He held this position from 1959 to 1962.\nTaylor ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for governor of Alaska in 1962, losing to incumbent and fellow constitutional convention delegate William A. Egan.  This meant that he was not a candidate for reelection to his House seat.  Nonetheless, he was reelected to the House in 1962, when one of the Fairbanks-area Democratic nominees elected in the primary election vacated his spot in favor of Taylor.\nTaylor retired from the House in 1966.  He later moved into the Fairbanks Pioneer Home, where he died on August 5, 1980."

Jones was largely responsible for the programme's innovative, surreal structure, in which sketches flowed from one to the next without the use of punch lines. He made his directorial debut with Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which he co-directed with Gilliam, and also directed the subsequent Python films Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life.\nJones co-created and co-wrote with Palin the anthology series Ripping Yarns. He also wrote an early draft of Jim Henson's film Labyrinth and is credited with the screenplay, though little of his work actually remained in the final cut. Jones was a well-respected medieval historian, having written several books and presented television documentaries about the period, as well as a prolific children's author. In 2016, Jones received a Lifetime Achievement award at the BAFTA Cymru Awards for his outstanding contribution to television and film.

The family home was named Bodchwil. As he recalled in The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons, he was \"born right bang slap in the middle of World War II,\" while his father served with the Royal Air Force in Scotland. A week after he was born, his father was posted in India as a Flight Lieutenant (Temporary). His brother Nigel was two years his senior. He reunited with his father when the war ended four years later; of their first meeting at Colwyn Bay railway station he recalled: \"I'd only ever been kissed by the smooth lips of a lady up until that point, so his bristly moustache was quite disturbing!\" When Jones was four and a half, the family moved to Claygate, Surrey, England.Jones attended Esher COE primary school and the Royal Grammar School in Guildford, where he was school captain in the 1960\u201361 academic year. He read English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, but \"strayed into history\". He became interested in the medieval period through reading Chaucer as part of his English degree. He graduated with a 2:1. While there, he performed comedy with future Monty Python castmate Michael Palin in the Oxford Revue. Jones was a year ahead of Palin at Oxford, and on first meeting him Palin states, \"The first thing that struck me was what a nice bloke he was. He had no airs and graces. We had a similar idea of what humour could do and where it should go, mainly because we both liked characters; we both appreciated that comedy wasn't just jokes.\""

At the National Conference, he was included on the committee for the drafting of internal regulations. At the end of the conference, he was appointed to the transitional government of Prime Minister Andr\u00e9 Milongo as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation.Kololo remained a member of the MCDDI until splitting from it in 1994 to form a new party, the Congolese Alliance for Unity and People's Freedoms (ACULP). He was then appointed as High Commissioner for Human Rights by President Pascal Lissouba. In the midst of the June\u2013October 1997 civil war, he urged France to not recognize any \"political leaders with armed militias\" in late July 1997.During the December 1998 violence in Brazzaville, Kololo fled the city's Bacongo neighborhood and spent three months hiding in the Pool Region before arriving across the Congo River in Kinshasa; he was \"in a state of total exhaustion\" by that point and was hospitalized in Kinshasa. An emissary of President Denis Sassou Nguesso offered to pay for Kololo to be evacuated to Europe for urgent medical treatment, but the Belgian airline Sabena refused to accept him as a passenger on 27 April 1999 out of concern that he would die during the flight. Kololo then died of amoebic dysentery in Kinshasa on the next day, on 28 April.\n\n\n== References =="

In 1928 he published the results of his research and that of his collaborators in a book entitled \u201cThe Disease of the Andes\u201d, a valuable contribution to medical science. In 1929 this condition was named \u201cMonge's Disease\u201d by the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the Sorbonne.\nIn 1931, Monge suggested the creation of the National Institute of Andean Biology to the authorities of the University of San Marcos, and he became its Director in 1934.\nMonge participated in many international conferences. He was a delegate from Peru to the International Medical Congress held in London in 1929; chairman of the delegation from Peru to the IX Pan American Sanitary Conference in 1934; Peru delegate to the Second Pan American Conference on Eugenics and Homicultura in 1934 and the Peruvian government delegate to the organization of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), in Mexico 1947.\nIn recognition of his medical work, Monge was elected president of the National Academy of Medicine from 1933 to 1936; member of the American Society for the advancement of science in 1934 and an honorary member of the Academy of Medicine of Buenos Aires, in 1934.\nMonge also was vice president of International Studies Conference Stations of the Great Cultures, held in Switzerland in 1948; President of the Peruvian delegation of the II General Assembly of UNESCO in Beirut in 1948; Peru delegate at the Conference on Narcotic Drugs of the UN, New York in 1950; Rapporteur of the International Congress of Medicine in Buenos Aires in 1964, among other prestigious positions.\nHe was also honorary professor of the Faculty of Medical Sciences at the University of Cochabamba, Bolivia in 1947, a member of the Executive Council of the National Commission of Peru for Cooperation with UNESCO in 1962, as well as consultant on indigenous and tribal peoples of the International Labour Organization in 1962.\nFor his work as a professor, researcher and doctor at various hospitals, Dr. Monge was recognized and held in distinction by a number of educational and medical institutions.

The Labour Party had introduced a compulsory retirement age for MPs, which applied to Howard, who had already been showing signs of ageing. Once retired, she became increasingly isolated and paranoid, on top of the onset of dementia and pneumonia that she had already suffered while still in Parliament. On a court order, she was eventually committed to Sunnyside Hospital, a mental asylum. She died there on 23 June 1972. She is buried with her father, Ted Howard, at Bromley Cemetery in Christchurch."

        "content": "Linney was born in Philadelphia, the son of Maitland (n\u00e9e Thompson) Linney and physician Romulus Zachariah Linney III. His great-grandfather was Romulus Zachariah Linney, a prominent North Carolinian who served the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War and was a U.S. Congressman. Linney grew up in the town of Madison, Tennessee where his father was an M.D. He also lived with his extended family for a few years during the Great Depression in the Linney/Coffey homestead in Boone, North Carolina and returned to the homestead to visit his favorite cousins, the Coffeys, throughout his life. Linney recalled that his mother \"was a very good amateur actress\" and when she starred in the Nashville Community Theatre's 1940 production of Our Town as Mrs. Gibbs, he was deeply moved by her performance, particularly by her character's death. \"I became really connected to my mother and it was the first time I was really shattered by a play. And in many ways that was the beginning. It, in a very visceral way, showed me the profound impact theater can have... Music might give you exultation or something else equally profound, but theater at a great stroke can just shatter you, can break you.\" Linney's father died of throat cancer when Linney was 13 years old. Linney said about his father's death, \"I've never gotten over it. My father was a very good man...I think his death is in everything I do. All other experiences in life pall beside the death of a parent you dearly love, when you have to deal with that as a child. No religion can console you for it. Nothing can.\" After his father's death, Linney and his mother moved to Washington, D.C., where he attended middle school and high school.He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Oberlin College and a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Yale School of Drama. He is an alumnus of HB Studio in New York City. He authored three novels, four opera librettos, twenty short stories, and 85 plays which have been staged throughout the United States from South Coast Repertory in California to the Virginia Museum Theater (VMT) in Richmond, and in Europe and Asia. His plays include The Sorrows of Frederick, Holy Ghosts, Childe Byron, Heathen Valley, and an adaptation of Ernest J. Gaines's novel, A Lesson Before Dying, which has been produced in New York and in numerous regional theaters. Many of his plays were set in Appalachia (Tennessee, Holy Ghosts, Sand Mountain, Gint and Heathen Valley), while others focused on historical subjects (The Sorrows of Frederick, King Philip, 2: Goering at Nuremberg). His adaptations for the American stage of several modern foreign classics\u2014plays and tales from Tolstoy, Chekhov, Ibsen and others\u2014have been performed from New York to Minneapolis, and his melding of two novels by Henry Adams into the comedy Democracy was premiered by artistic director Keith Fowler at VMT.  Linney's vivid biographical reconstructions of controversial personalities are remarkable for their power to retain a lifelike vigor\u2014as in his treatment of Hermann Goering in 2: Goering at Nuremberg, and Lord Byron in Childe Byron.In 2010 before his death, Linney completed a libretto for an opera by Scott Wheeler based on his first play The Sorrows of Frederick commissioned by The Metropolitan Opera and Lincoln Center Theater. He also completed a full-length play about Alzheimer's disease, Over Martinis, Driving Somewhere, which received a workshop at New York Stage and Film in the summer of 2010.\nAmong Linney's many awards were two Obie awards, one for sustained excellence in play writing; two National Critics Awards; three Drama-Logue Awards; and fellowships from the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations, the New York Foundation for the Arts and the National Endowment of the Arts. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which conferred upon him its Award in Literature, Award of Merit and its highest award, the gold medal. He received honorary doctorates from Oberlin College in 1994, from Appalachian State University in 1995, and from Wake Forest University in 1998.He was a member of the Ensemble Studio Theatre, the Fellowship of Southern Writers, National Theatre Conference, College of Fellows of the American Theatre, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Corporation of Yaddo.  Linney had been chair of the MFA Playwriting program at Columbia University\u2019s School of the Arts and Professor of Playwriting in the Actors Studio MFA Program at The New School in New York. He also taught over the years at Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, Connecticut College, and the Sewanee Writers Conference among others.\nLinney was the founding playwright of Signature Theatre Company, which named a theater in his honor in the new Signature Center, which opened in 2012.  On his birthday September 21, 2012, the University of North Carolina at its Appalachian State University campus in Boone, NC opened his archives for researchers and scholars."

He was educated at Berlin and Jena universities. During 1867 and 1868 he was the holder of a fellowship at the Royal Statistical Bureau of Berlin, and in 1869 became privat-docent at the University of Heidelberg, but in the same year accepted an invitation from the Polytechnikum at Riga. Cohn paid a visit to England in 1873, and the fruits of his observation and research were embodied in the masterly production \"Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Englische Eisenbahnpolitik,\" 2 vols., Leipzig, 1874-75. In 1875, he was invited to fill the chair of economics at ETH Zurich, which he held until 1884, when he became professor in the University of G\u00f6ttingen.\nWhile at Zurich he prepared for publication his \"Volkswirtschaftliche Aufs\u00e4tze\" (Stuttgart, 1882), and contributed to the \"G\u00f6ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen\" (1880, i. 97-135) an exhaustive critical review of the first volume of Wagner's \"Allgemeine Volkswirtschaftlehre.\" The names of Wagner and Cohn have often been coupled, not only because both were classed among the Katheder-Socialisten, but also because they have much in common in their attitude toward the various so-called schools of economic science. In continuation of his study of the English railroad policy, and as the third volume of his earlier work on that subject, appeared his \"Die Englische Eisenbahnpolitik der Letzten Zehn Jahre,\" Leipzig, 1883.\nAfter his establishment at G\u00f6ttingen a period of ardent literary activity set in. The first volume of the greatest work which he has yet produced, his \"System der National\u00f6konomie,\" was published in 1885, the very next year after his arrival. It is significant of the importance and character of this work that two such great leaders of the respective opposing \"schools\" as Wagner and Schmoller should unite in praising it.\nIn 1886, he contributed to the \"Jahrbuch f\u00fcr National\u00f6konomie\"(vol. xiii, No. 6), \"Zur Fabrikgesetzgebung,\" a review of government reports on factory legislation in Switzerland and Saxony, and to the \"Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Gesetzgebung\" (x.3), \"Er\u00f6terungen \u00fcber die Fiskalische Behandlung der Verkehrsanstalten.\" In that year, too, appeared his \"National\u00f6konomische Studien,\" Stuttgart, 1886.\nThe year 1889 witnessed the publication of the second volume of his \"System der National\u00f6konomie,\" and his \"Finanzwissenschaft.\"\nCohn was elected a regular member of the Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften at G\u00f6ttingen in 1894; and in 1896 the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle of the fourth class was conferred upon him. After an interval of nearly ten years he completed the third volume of the \"System der National\u00f6konomie,\" which was also issued under the title \"National\u00f6konomie des Handelsund Verkehrswesens: Ein Lesebuch f\u00fcr Studierende,\" Stuttgart, 1898. To the \"Jahrbuch f\u00fcr National\u00f6konomie\" (vi, Jan., 1901) he contributed \"Ueber die Vereinigung der Staatswissenschaften mit den Juristenfacult\u00e4ten.\""

This and his almost slavish loyalty to Stalin led to De Groot becoming political secretary of the party in 1938, which had since been renamed Communist Party of the Netherlands.

In the Volksdagblad he wrote that English imperialism and the Dutch bourgeoisie had provoked the occupation.It did not prevent the CPN and its organs from being banned by the Germans. In November 1940, the first issue of a new, illegal party newspaper, De Waarheid, was published. De Groot aimed his arrows at the German aggressor, but also continued to fight \"Anglo-American imperialism\", the government in London and the SDAP. Only with the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941 did he change course. Incidentally, it was not De Groot, as the party legend later proposed, but fellow board member Jansen who wrote the famous manifesto 'Staakt, staakt, staakt' on the eve of the February strike of 1941. The CPN has always considered this strike to be the culmination of the communist resistance against the Nazis in the Netherlands.\nIn October 1942, the Germans raided the house where De Groot and his family were hiding. De Groot managed to escape through the back door, but his wife and daughter were taken to Auschwitz and gassed there, which made him feel guilty and troubled the rest of his life. In February 1943 he again narrowly escaped arrest by the Germans. He then turned the party leadership over to others (including Jaap Brandenburg) and cut off all contact with the illegal party."

For a short time he promoted the dissolution of the party in favour of an 'Association of Friends of De Waarheid', because in that first post-war period the communist newspaper De Waarheid enjoyed wide popularity because of its resistance history. Fierce criticism in his own ranks and an ok from Moscow made De Groot decide in July 1945 to re-establish the CPN.\n\nDe Groot also entered the House of Representatives. There and in De Waarheid, of which he had become editor-in-chief, he sometimes defended contradictory views. For example, with regard to the young Indonesian republic: on the one hand he was against sending Dutch troops to violently crush the nationalist resistance in Java and elsewhere, on the other hand he thought that young communists should be sent out and then propaganda within the army for Indonesian independence. In their own communist circle this led to confusion and dissatisfaction."

He thought the current leadership was too soft - young academics and social workers had increasingly taken the place of workers as members and administrators in the 1970s - and wanted to see it replaced by steel worker frameworks. With that, however, he overplayed his hand. The party board opposed and stripped him of honorary membership (1978). De Groot's role had been played."

After hearing Nacogdoches citizens denounce the despotism of Mexico, Rusk became involved in the independence movement. He organized volunteers from Nacogdoches and hastened to Gonzales, where his men joined Stephen F. Austin's army in preventing the Mexicans from seizing their cannon. They proceeded to San Antonio, but Rusk left the army before the Siege of B\u00e9xar.\nThe provisional government named him inspector general of the army in the Nacogdoches District. As a delegate from Nacogdoches to the Convention of 1836, Rusk not only signed the Texas Declaration of Independence but also chaired the committee to revise the constitution of the Republic of Texas. The ad interim government, installed on March 17, 1836, appointed Rusk as Secretary of War. When informed that the Alamo had fallen and the Mexican army was moving eastward, Rusk helped President David Burnet to move the government to Harrisburg.\nAfter the Mexicans killed all James W. Fannin's Texan army at Goliad, Burnet sent Rusk with orders for General Sam Houston to make a stand against the enemy. Rusk participated with bravery in the defeat of Santa Anna on April 21, 1836, in the Battle of San Jacinto. From May to October 1836, he served as commander-in-chief of the Army of the Republic of Texas, with the rank of brigadier general.

He joined Milam Lodge No. 40 (Later Milam Lodge #2) in Nacogdoches in 1837 and was a founding member of the Grand Lodge of Texas, organized in Houston on December 20, 1837.\nAs chairman of the House Military Committee in 1837, he sponsored a militia bill that passed over Houston's veto, and Congress elected Rusk major general of the militia. In the summer of 1838, he commanded the Nacogdoches militia, which suppressed the C\u00f3rdova Rebellion. In October, when Mexican agents were discovered among the Kickapoo Indians, Rusk defeated those Indians and their Indian allies. He captured marauding Caddo Indians in November 1838 and risked an international incident when he invaded United States territory to return them to the Indian agent in Shreveport, Louisiana.\nOn December 12, 1838, the Texas Congress elected Rusk Chief Justice of the Republic's Supreme Court. He served until June 30, 1840, when he resigned to resume his law practice. Later he headed the bar of the Republic of Texas. He and J. Pinckney Henderson, later the first governor of the state of Texas, formed a law partnership in 1841.\nEarly in 1843, Rusk was called upon once again to serve as a military commander. Concern over the lack of protection on the frontier caused Congress, in a joint ballot on January 16, 1843, to elect Rusk major general of the militia of the Republic of Texas. But he resigned in June when Houston obstructed his plans for aggressive warfare against Mexico. Rusk then turned his energies to establishing Nacogdoches University (operated 1845\u20131895).

He attended Harvard University and graduated magna cum laude in the class of 1971, after transferring from Amherst College after two years concentrating in a cross major between anthropology and visual studies. His first endeavor in filmmaking was a commissioned recruiting film for Harvard's Admissions Office in 1970, which became his senior thesis. He is Jewish.Upon graduation, Cohen immediately headed to Los Angeles to work as a screenwriter for Martin Jurow but soon found himself unemployed when the producer moved out of state.\nAfter a six-month stint as a kennel boy at the Harvey Animal Hospital in West Hollywood to make ends meet, Cohen landed a job as a reader for then-agent Mike Medavoy. Six weeks into his tenure at International Famous Agency (now part of ICM), he distinguished himself by discovering an unheralded script he found in a slush pile of neglected screenplays. Recognizing its quality, commerciality and uniqueness, Cohen wrote in his coverage that it was \"the great American screenplay and this will make an award-winning, major-cast, major-director film.\" He championed the piece relentlessly, with his own job at stake, as Medavoy said that he would try to sell it on that recommendation, but promising to fire Cohen if he could not. Universal bought it that afternoon for a record price, and it became the Academy Award winning movie The Sting (1973). Cohen still keeps the coverage framed on the wall of his office, as this gave him his first identity in Hollywood: \"the kid who found The Sting.\""

In the same year, Tattersall married Blanche Yandall. In 1903, Tattersall took over the business when Davis died.

As the eldest son he stood to inherit the family plantation of Dodon in Maryland, but the coming of the Revolutionary War forced his father to divided his property between his sons. Hume was eventually to inherit the Scottish estates, with the Maryland lands being divided between his brothers, now loyal to the fledgling United States of America. These however were substantial; through his father he inherited the estates of Ballachallan, Argaty and Annat. These estates were held under entail, and Steuart changed his name to Hume (also spelled \"Home\") in order to be able to inherit."

Lehman was elected to Barrie City Council in the municipal election in November 2006, representing Ward 2, the city centre. Lehman won the election with 49.98% of the vote, falling just one vote short of an absolute majority.\nAs a councillor, Lehman was the Chairman of the Finance Committee of Council in 2007 and served as the chair of the city's Growth Management Working Group in 2008. At the time Barrie, the Town of Innisfil, and County of Simcoe were battling over contrasting visions for how the area should grow.  At the heart of the dispute was whether additional jobs and population should be focused in Barrie, or dispersed among the 16 municipalities in Simcoe County. Barrie argued growth should occur in cities with urban services and in June 2009, the Government of Ontario stepped in and resolved the dispute, annexing additional lands for growth to Barrie and the lion's share of the additional jobs.\nIn 2008, Lehman created the Historic Neighbourhoods Strategy, a plan for the older neighbourhoods in Barrie, generally those built before World War II. The strategy was innovative, as it focused on specific neighbourhoods, instead of considering services citywide, and because it was citizen-led. The project was co-ordinated by a committee of 16 volunteers from the 7 historic neighbourhoods and was approved by City Council in June 2010.\nLehman played a prominent role in the ultimately unsuccessful battle to save two schools in his ward, Prince of Wales PS, and Barrie Central Collegiate, including starting a Facebook group called \"Save Barrie Central\", which attracted 3,000 members in its first week. Lehman also worked on issues related to small business in Barrie, including eliminating the basic business license fee."

Lehman's campaign was the first in Barrie to use social media in a manner that is now more typical of elections in larger urban centres. Lehman won the election on 25 October 2010, with 39% of the popular vote. He was sworn in as the 46th mayor of Barrie in December 2010.\nDuring his first term in office, major new office/industrial campuses were developed in Barrie by IBM, TD Bank, Cogeco, Napoleon, and others. Barrie led all metropolitan areas east of Alberta in the rate of job creation from 2010 to 2014. Lehman launched a series of service reviews to modernize city services, and the City made the high-profile hirings of Carla Ladd as CAO of the City of Barrie in 2011 and Kimberley Greenwood as Chief of Police in 2013.Lehman drove a major overhaul and expansion of the city's transit system, launched in 2013. Initially beset by route and scheduling problems, the plan later helped deliver a dramatic increase in transit ridership, particularly after Georgian College and the City signed a student pass agreement a few years later.The city built a number of new public facilities during this time, including its first branch public library, a performing arts centre, the Allandale Waterfront GO Station, and the Military Heritage Park. Lehman's leadership resulted in annual tax increases declining from an average of 3.9% in the previous decade to 2.7% over the 2010 to 2020 period.\nIn October 2014, Lehman was re-elected for a second term, winning by a large margin with 92.3% of the popular vote.In 2014 and 2015, Barrie had the lowest crime index of any Canadian metropolitan areas. Lehman's second term was again characterized by economic expansion, further reduction in crime, and the construction of more public facilities, together with a further shifting growth patterns from suburban to more urban redevelopment. The city completed a major new public square in the city's historic downtown, Meridian Place, which includes an outdoor performing arts stage and in the adjacent Memorial Square, an expanded cenotaph in recognition the city's strong military history and relationship with Base Borden.\nAs residential rents in the city started to rise, Lehman championed an Affordable Housing Strategy adopted by City Council in early 2015. However, the city has continued to experience a housing crisis, due in part to a lack of purpose-built rental development since the 1980s.\nIn October 2018, Lehman was re-elected for a third term, winning 91% of the popular vote. Lehman's focus has been on housing, economic development, public space, and improving the city's fiscal condition. Lehman has played a prominent public role during the COVID-19 crisis by supporting public health measures with frequent video updates through his social media channels and in civic initiatives. He has also advocated for small business supports and changes to public health restrictions, most notably being one of several Ontario Mayors who pushed back when the Ford Government ordered playgrounds closed in April 2021.\nOn 15 July 2021, an F2 tornado struck south end neighbourhoods in the City of Barrie, damaging hundreds of homes and businesses. Lehman provided video updates from the impacted area following in the aftermath of the damage. As chair of Ontario's Big City Mayor's caucus, Lehman has advocated for the needs of large municipalities on issues affecting Ontario's cities, including advocating for decriminalization of simple possession of opioids, and the use of federal and provincial economic policies to address the housing crisis.Lehman ran for the Ontario Liberal Party in the 2022 Ontario general election in the riding of Barrie\u2014Springwater\u2014Oro-Medonte."

He joined the French Communist Party at the age of 17 in 1939 when the Communist Party was banned for supporting the German-Soviet pact. In July 1940, he created a student club, the Centre la\u00efque des auberges de la jeunesse (Claj), which served as a legal screen for the clandestine Union of Communist Students.When David Rousset (1912-1997) spoke out about Stalin's vast system of prison camps, Daix attacked him as a liar, denying that the GULAG system existed in the Soviet Union, in a 16 page article in Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises, entitled \"Pourquoi M. David Rousset a-t-il invent\u00e9 les camps sovi\u00e9tiques?\". Rousset brought libel charges against Daix and there was a public trial in France, which Rousset, who had told the truth about the camps, won in 1950.  As a French communist, Daix continued his uncritical support for the Soviet Union for many years, though late in life he admitted he had been wrong.From 1980 to 1985, he was a journalist for Le Quotidien de Paris.\n\n\n== References =="

Ranieri was noted for his role as a soldier and also as the author of two books on military architecture. The Duke of Urbino, Duke Guidobaldo II, honoured him with the title Marchese del Monte so the family had only become a noble one in the generation before Guidobaldo. On the death of his father Guidobaldo inherited the title of Marchese.\nGuidobaldo studied mathematics at the University of Padua in 1564. While there he became a friend of the great Italian poet Torquato Tasso. In fact Guidobaldo may have known Tasso before they studied at Padua together, for Tasso was almost exactly the same age as Guidobaldo and had been educated at the court of the Duke of Urbino, with the duke's son, from 1556.\nGuidobaldo then served as a soldier in the ensuing conflict in Hungary between the Habsburg Empire and the Ottoman Empire. After serving in the army, Guidobaldo returned to his estate of (Monte Baroccio) Mombaroccio in the Marche, where he was able to spend his time doing research into mathematics, mechanics, astronomy and optics. He studied mathematics under Federico Commandino during this period and became one of his most staunch disciples. He also became a friend of Bernardino Baldi, who was also a student of Commandino around the same time.\nHe corresponded with several mathematicians including Giacomo Contarini, Francesco Barozzi and Galileo Galilei. His invention of a drafting instrument for constructing regular polygons and dividing a line into any number of segments was incorporated as a feature of Galileo's geometric and military compass.\nGuidobaldo was also important in helping Galileo Galilei in his academic career. Galileo, then a promising, but unemployed 26-year-old, had written an essay on hydrostatic balance, which struck Guidobaldo as being nothing short of genius. He then commended Galileo to his brother, the Cardinal Del Monte, who referred him to the powerful Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando I de' Medici. Under his patronage, Galileo got an indication to a professorship of mathematics at the University of Pisa, in 1589. Guidobaldo became a staunch friend of Galileo and helped him again in 1592, when he had to apply to the chair of mathematics at the University of Padua, due to the hatred and machinations of Giovanni de' Medici, a son of Cosimo I de' Medici, against Galileo. Notwithstanding their friendship, Guidobaldo was a critic of Galileo's principle of the isochronicity of the pendulum, a major discovery which Guidobaldo thought was impossible.\nGuidobaldo wrote an influential book about perspective, titled Perspectivae Libri VI, published at Pesaro in 1600. Several painters, architects and the theater stage designer Nicola Sabbatini used this geometrical knowledge in their works.\nHe died at Mombaroccio in 1607."

In the last year of the First World War, Joseph Freiherr von W\u00e4chter was decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa, which earned him the title of Freiherr (Baron). In 1922, after the First Austrian Republic was established, he was twice nominated two times as Minister of Defence in the Cabinets of Johann Schober (in the first replacing Carl Vaugoin).Otto W\u00e4chter spent his first years in Vienna before the family moved to Trieste (then part of Austria-Hungary) in 1908. For the duration of World War I, he lived in southern Bohemia, studying and taking his Matura school leaving examinations in 1919 in \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, then called by its German name, Budweis, where everyday life was dominated by the national differences between Germans and Czechs.\nThe family moved to Vienna, where W\u00e4chter studied law and joined national and sporting organizations.

Until 1940, his deputy was Arthur Seyss-Inquart, who took W\u00e4chter with him to the General Government, where he was appointed as Governor of the administrative district of Krak\u00f3w. W\u00e4chter  chose the two crowns of Galicia in the coat-of-arms issued for the nobility of his father. As Governor of Krak\u00f3w, he was under the direct and local supervision of Frank and had to face the fanatical actions of the local SS and police forces.\nThe arrest on 6 November 1939 of the entire staff of professors and academics of the Jagiellonian University and other academic institutions and their subsequent deportation to Sachsenhausen concentration camp called Sonderaktion Krakau resulted in widespread condemnation worldwide. W\u00e4chter publicly criticised the action which took place without his knowledge and reportedly tried to free the academics. Due to the \"Special Action Krak\u00f3w\", he was indicted by exiled Poles in New York in 1942.In his capacity as Governor, an execution warrant for 52 Poles in Bochnia was issued 18 December 1939 under W\u00e4chter's signature, as reprisal for killing two Viennese police officers. Likewise in December 1940, a decree organizing the expulsion of the city's 68,000 Jews also appeared under his name as did a further decree ordering the remaining 15,000 Jews to move into the newly created Krak\u00f3w Ghetto (\"Jewish Residence Zone\") issued on 3 March 1941.W\u00e4chter, unlike his wife who was often in the company of the Franks, tried to keep his distance from them. The family lived in a pseudo-Romanesque villa in Przegorzaly on a steep slope above the Vistula outside Krak\u00f3w, which belonged to Professor Szyszko-Bohusz, head of the restoration measures of the Royal Wawel. The atmosphere of the confiscated building did not meet with the approval of W\u00e4chter's wife, so she built a house which she called \"Wartenberg Castle\". Frustrated with the severe limitations of his role, W\u00e4chter was about to resign from his office in Krak\u00f3w, when he received a new posting in Galicia."

        "content": "Following Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the Soviet-occupied eastern part of the former Austrian province of Galicia was attached to the General Government as the District of Galicia. Its capital city, variously known as L'viv (Ukrainian), Lw\u00f3w (Polish) and Lemberg (German), had been - after Vienna, Budapest and Prague - the largest in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where Poles, Ukrainians and Jews had lived together for centuries. The first German governor was Karl Lasch, an intimate friend of Frank, who was later arrested and shot for extensive black market activities on orders of Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler. W\u00e4chter was chosen by Adolf Hitler \"as the best man on the spot\", and installed as Governor on 22 January 1943.\nHis first official visit was to the influential and respected Greek Catholic Metropolit Andrij Aleksander Szeptycki (Sheptytsky). With his assistance, W\u00e4chter endeavored to promote a greater degree of co-operation among the occupying Germans and the ethnic elements in the district of Galicia. Consequently, he immediately found himself in conflict with SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Friedrich-Wilhelm Kr\u00fcger, the Reichsf\u00fchrer's representative in the General Government and executor of his planned large scale resettlement programs. At the government meeting in Krak\u00f3w on 17 February, W\u00e4chter publicly opposed plans to \"germanize\" the city of Lemberg, which would have resulted in the expulsion of its entire population stating: \"A German colonization of the East during the war would bring about the collapse of production.\"W\u00e4chter's continued opposition to Kr\u00fcger's policies led to a number of open confrontations. To avoid further altercations, Himmler offered W\u00e4chter the chance to relocate to Vienna, which he declined. As Governor of Galicia, he remained a firm believer in the principle \"Germany first\". He was frequently obliged to use his influence and connections by first circumventing General Governor Hans Frank and by exploiting the strained relations between Frank and Himmler to pursue his own policies. W\u00e4chter selected men with liberal views for the key posts in his administration, notably his department heads Otto Bauer and Ludwig Losacker, whom he consulted before deciding all important issues.In late 1942, W\u00e4chter visited the \"Reichskommissariat Ukraine\" (eastern Ukraine) to witness first hand the effect of the implementation of the Nazi Untermensch (subhuman) philosophy by Gauleiter Erich Koch and his policies of repression and subjugation. On his return in December 1942, he sent a secret ten page letter to Martin Bormann in the F\u00fchrer Headquarters in Berlin, criticizing the serious mistakes made in the handling of the Ukrainians.\nWhilst Governor of Galicia, he established a Waffen-SS Division recruited from the Ukrainian population of Galicia, under German supervision, to fight against the hated Bolsheviks. The formation of the unit was approved by Himmler after the disastrous German defeat at Stalingrad. W\u00e4chter submitted the proposal to Himmler on 1 March 1943, and, on 28 April, the SS Division Galicia was publicly inaugurated."

        "content": "Nazi documents detail W\u00e4chter's involvement with the establishment of ghettos, and the Final Solution, the extermination of Europe's Jews. W\u00e4chter's name is seen on the order to establish the Krak\u00f3w ghetto, where many inhabitants perished, and the rest would eventually be liquidated as a part of Operation Reinhard. W\u00e4chter also ran the transportation systems, which would carry trains of Jews to their death under his watch. The U.S. Justice Department also holds documents indicting W\u00e4chter. One, signed on March 13, 1942, by W\u00e4chter, was an order to restrict the employment of Jews throughout Galicia. The Justice Department also maintains a document from Heinrich Himmler to Wilhelm Stuckart, the State Secretary to the Reich Minister of the Interior in Berlin, on W\u00e4chter's future, dated August 25, 1942.  It describes how Himmler was recently in Lemberg and asked W\u00e4chter if he would want to be transferred out to Vienna. W\u00e4chter replied to Himmler that he did not want to go to Vienna. This document implies W\u00e4chter willingly wanted to stay in Lemberg for the implementation of Operation Reinhard and directly refutes Horst's claim that his father \"had no chance to leave the system.\"While W\u00e4chter was Governor of Galicia, he oversaw the implementation of the Final Solution. After 75,000 Jews died in the first month during Operation Reinhard, Hans Frank made a speech in the Parliament of Galicia praising W\u00e4chter's job for \"making Lemberg a proud city.\" Although these actions would almost certainly indict W\u00e4chter for command responsibility, W\u00e4chter was not directly responsible for Operation Reinhard, since he was a member of the civil government. The dual German administration in the General Government meant that he did not control the SS or Police; these matters in Lemberg were under the control of SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer Fritz Katzmann, the SS and Police Leader of the District of Galicia. Although he likely would have worked closely with the SS to carry out the operations, he was not directly a part of the group that implemented them.As far as direct responsibility, Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal claims in his book The Murderers Among Us, that W\u00e4chter personally oversaw the transportation of four thousand Jews to extermination camps and was responsible for killing at least 800,000 Jews. Specifically, Wiesenthal also claims to have seen W\u00e4chter in Lemberg on August 15, 1942, while his mother and other Jews were being loaded on a train to their death. However, Horst owns a letter written by his father for his mother on that date, from a party meeting in Krakow. Horst believes Wiesenthal may have mistaken Fritz Katzmann for his father since, according to the letter, W\u00e4chter was not in Lemberg on August 15.On September 28, 1946, the Polish government sent a document to the Military Governor of the American occupation zone in Germany requesting \"that W\u00e4chter be delivered to Poland for trial for mass murder, shooting and executions. Under his command of District Galicia, more than one hundred thousand Polish citizens lost their lives.\" Due to W\u00e4chter's death in Rome in 1949, he was never tried for charges in Poland. The extent of his criminal involvement in the final solution was never brought before a court."

        "content": "In 1943, W\u00e4chter conceived the idea of creating a Waffen-SS division made up of Ukrainians. The division was organized as a part of a program of creating foreign (e.g., Estonian, Latvian) formations of the Waffen-SS to fight with the Germans on the Soviet front. Wachter first proposed his idea to SS Reichsf\u00fchrer Heinrich Himmler on March 1, 1943, and wanted to name them Division Ukraine. W\u00e4chter succeeded in creating the division, but they were ultimately called Division Galizien. The creation of the Division Galizien was announced on April 28, 1943, at ceremonies throughout Galicia. W\u00e4chter appointed the members of the Military Board of the Division Galizien and had good relations with them. In 1945, he was the commander in chief of all Waffen SS divisions made up of non-Germans. In organizing Waffen-SS Galizien, W\u00e4chter worked closely with the head of the Ukrainian Central Committee in Cracow, Volodymyr Kubijovy\u010d.In March 1945, the German government announced the formation of the Ukrainian National Army. W\u00e4chter successfully secured the appointment of General Pavlo Shandruk, a former officer in the Polish Army, as commander of the Ukrainian National Army. On April 25, 1945, the Waffen-SS Galizien was officially reorganized as the First Division of the Ukrainian National Army, and swear a new oath of loyalty to the Ukrainian people.Modern Ukraine remains divided on the legacy of World War II, although nationalists, hardcore rightists and neo-Nazis continue to honor the Waffen-SS Galizien today through yearly celebrations."

In response, Himmler agreed to order his release on the basis that he assume a new commission as \"Chief of the Military Administration to the Plenipotentiary General of the German Wehrmacht in Italy headed by SS-Obergruppenfuhrer Karl Wolff. Himmler felt W\u00e4chter would be \"of immense use in this equally interesting and difficult field.\" On assuming his new post, W\u00e4chter relocated to Gardone on Lake Garda.As the German situation at the front worsened day by day, in a vain attempt to regain the military initiative the Nazi authorities became increasingly desperate and sought to exploit the Eastern European Anti-Bolshevik movements. In so doing, on 30 January 1945, Himmler appointed W\u00e4chter as subsidiary head of the Group D of the Reich Security Main Office in Berlin, which sought to utilize and combine the Russian Liberation Army of General Andrey Vlasov and the newly formed Ukrainian National Army which included the 1st Ukrainian Division (formerly the SS 14th Galician Division), the creation of which he had instigated.\nVlasov's 'federalist' concept which required the subordination of all the other former Soviet nationalities to his overall command, proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for W\u00e4chter who was unable to bring about the unification of Vlasov and the separatist Ukrainians led by General Pavlo Shandruk. Nevertheless, W\u00e4chter redoubled his efforts with the Ukrainians whom he rejoined on 7 April 1945 in Carinthia. On 8 May 1945, W\u00e4chter informed General Shandruk of the unconditional surrender of the German Reich with the following words: \"Now, General, you are the central figure in the action of saving the Division, and possibly of all of us who are with you.\" In Zell am See, amidst the German collapse, his wife burned a crate full of documents he had methodically collected to justify his deeds, which should demonstrate \"that he had done everything to help so many people\"."

Together with a young member of the 24th Waffen-Gebirgs-(Karstj\u00e4ger-) Division of the Waffen-SS, he successfully hid for four years, sustained by his wife who supplied both men with food and equipment from secret pick-up points. In the spring of 1949, W\u00e4chter crossed the border to South Tyrol in Italy where he met his wife and his elder children for the last time.\nOn 24 April 1949, he arrived in Rome, where, through pro-Nazi Bishop Alois Hudal, rector of the Teutonic College of Santa Maria dell'Anima, he found rudimentary accommodation in the clerical institute \"Vigna Pia\" on the southern outskirts of Rome under the name of Alfredo Reinhardt. In June, he took part in an Italian film, playing the part of an actor and was in the process of collecting information about a flight to South America. As a result of his daily morning swim in the polluted Tiber, he appeared jaundiced on 3 July. On 9 July, he was taken to Santo Spirito Hospital near the Vatican where W\u00e4chter revealed his true identity.

Although a self-portrait, the subject of the painting was the color yellow.

He also frequented the 'studia' of his religious order in Padua and Rome before assuming the duties of a lecturer in Cesena, Perugia and Padua.He acquired a profound knowledge of scholastic philosophy and theology, being deeply versed in the writings of Duns Scotus. Nevertheless, he was an open-minded and independent scholar. As a controversialist he was harsh and arrogant towards his opponents, mingling invective with his arguments. His opinions on some philosophical questions were fiercely combatted by many of his contemporaries and especially by Matthew Ferchi and the Irish Franciscan John Punch. Mastrius particularly objected to Punch's methodology, arguing that neither his conclusions nor his argumentation were faithful to Scotus.When presenting the second volume of his work on the \"Sentences\" to Alexander VII, to whom he had dedicated it, the pope asked him where he had learned to treat his opponent Ferchi in such a rough manner: Mastrius answered, \"From St. Augustine and St. Jerome, who in defence of their respective opinions on the interpretation of Holy Scripture fought hard and not without reason\".\nThe pope smilingly remarked, \"From such masters other things could be learned\".Mastrius had a well-ordered intellect which is seen in the clearness and precision with which he sets forth the subject-matter of discussion. His arguments for and against a proposition show real critical power and are expressed in accurate and clear language. His numerous quotations from ancient and contemporary authors and various schools of thought are a proof of his extensive reading. His works shed light on some of the difficult questions in Scotistic philosophy and theology.\nIn 2002, to celebrate the fourth centenary of his birth, an international conference was held in Meldola, Mastri\u2019s native town (near Forl\u00ec), devoted to his philosophical thought."

Later during that year he was transferred to the same position in Vladivostok in the Soviet Union, where he remained until 1920 when he became the consul in San Francisco in the US. In 1922, he was appointed as the consul in Chicago and served in that position until 1926. In February 1926, he was promoted to Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and during September of the same year he was appointed Head of Department in the Directorate for Contracts of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Acting Director of the Consular and Trade Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

        "content": "Bo\u017eidar Puri\u0107 was appointed for the prime minister of the Yugoslav government-in-exile on 10 August 1943, succeeding Milo\u0161 Trifunovi\u0107 who resigned after constant disputes between Serbian and Croatian members of his cabinet. Puri\u0107's cabinet was composed of nonpolitical appointees. Puri\u0107, alike the previous prime ministers of the government-in-exile supported the Chetniks (the Serbian nationalist movement in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia), and their leader, Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 remained Minister of Defence in Puri\u0107's cabinet. Chetnik collaboration with Italians and the Germans, as well as fighting against the Partisan resistance movement caused the British to pressure the Yugoslav government to remove Mihailovi\u0107 from office. After Puri\u0107 assumed office this pressure became more intense as creating a strong resistance in Yugoslavia became imperative for reducing pressure on Allied forces fighting in Italy. Mihailovi\u0107 retained support from the government-in-exile despite his refusal to cooperate with the Partisans. Puri\u0107, despite being appointed with British blessings, rejected their appeals to remove Mihailovi\u0107 from the office.Puri\u0107's cabinet dispersed the \"League of Majors\", a group of inner circle advisers to King Peter headed by Kne\u017eevi\u0107 brothers. Radoje Kne\u017eevi\u0107 was removed from the position of Minister of the Royal Court and sent to Lisbon as charg\u00e9 d'affaires by Milo\u0161 Trifunovi\u0107. Puri\u0107 sent \u017divan Kne\u017eevi\u0107 to Washington as a military attach\u00e9. Two aides-de-camp to the king, Vlastimir Ro\u017edjalovski and Svetislav Vohoska, were sent to parachuting training in a British base so they could be dropped to Chetniks in Yugoslavia, this, however never happened.Squabbles between Serbian and other ministers, which had troubled previous cabinets were not present in Puri\u0107's cabinet, which enabled it to come to decisions on pressing issues. The government moved to Cairo, a move which was suggested by the British during Trifunovi\u0107's tenure. It was decided that Bogoljub Jevti\u0107 should become Yugoslav ambassador to London and King Peter was given permission to marry Princess Alexandra which was opposed by the previous Prime Ministers.On 7 December 1943, Anthony Eden talked for the first time with Puri\u0107 since the Tehran conference, where it was decided that Allies should support Yugoslav Partisans. After the meeting, Puri\u0107 spoke with American ambassador Lincoln MacVeagh who later reported that Puri\u0107 was extremely dissatisfied with the British decision to not allow his government to have direct communications with its people, which he called British failure to cooperate with the Yugoslav government. He also expressed concern that Allied military support to Partisans would cause conservative elements of the population to collaborate with the Germans. This confirmed suspicions of the Chetnik collaboration with the Germans, despite Puri\u0107 likely not knowing about non-aggression pacts concluded between the Chetniks and Germans few weeks prior.In March 1944, the Allies decided to withdraw aid and recognition from the Chetniks after a period of worsening relations between the British and the Chetniks. Even after this, the Puri\u0107 government refused to remove Mihailovi\u0107 from the office which resulted in a complete breakdown in relations between pro-Chetnik officials who controlled Yugoslav government-in-exile and the British. On 13 April 1944, a conference between Churchill and King Peter was held during which Churchill urged Peter to dismiss Puri\u0107's cabinet as soon as possible and in that way get rid of Mihailovi\u0107. Because in the following months Mihailovi\u0107 might oppose Soviet forces if they were to cross in Yugoslav territory which would prove embarrassing for the king. Churchill promised Peter that he would aid him in matters of publicity if the king accepted his suggestion. King met with the British ambassador to the Yugoslav government Skrine Stevenson during the next day, and he seemed ready to take Churchill's advice. However, the king soon changed his mind, likely after talking with Puri\u0107, and on 17 April he sent an urgent letter to US President Roosevelt saying that dismissing his best Prime Minister and relieve Mihailovi\u0107 would mean committing an act of treason on his nation. It remains unclear whether Roosevelt sent a reply but in a draft letter there seemed to be no encouragement to the king and Roosevelt generally agreed with British handling of Yugoslav affairs. After a series of moves and several months of British pressure, King Peter agreed to dismiss Puri\u0107's cabinet on 8 July 1944."

Alastair Niven, judge of the Man Booker Prize for 2014, described it as \"a moving and necessary novel\", and The Bookseller called it \"a terrifically absorbing, topical and quietly affecting novel of interlocking worlds and relationships\".If You Can Walk, You Can Dance (1999 ) won the Commonwealth Writers Prize for the best book in the Africa region. In 2017 it was re-issued by Niyogi Books in India, where it was long-listed for the Atta Galatta Bangalore Literary Festival Prize.  It follows a young woman fleeing from the threat of prison in South Africa, across countries and cultures, to find a new meaning for her life through music. The composer Diana Burrell called it \"an exhilarating book that celebrates the power of music as universal language, healer, political tool - the thread that links humankind across cultures and continents\".Boyd Tonkin, reviewer for The Independent, described it as \"ambitious and gripping \u2026 an eloquent exploration of what music can mean in a life \u2026 handled with a zest that outshines most of this year's cacophony of musically-themed fictions.\"Somewhere More Simple (2007) is set in the small-scale world of the Isles of Scilly, off the coast of Cornwall. It\u2019s a story of newcomers to the islands, drawn to what seems a simpler life in a place blessed by nature and apparently cut off from mainland pressures; but their own complexities follow them. The New Zealand Sunday Herald called it \u2018an intense, deeply personal novel \u2026 a muted, reflective meditation on the need for resolution.\u2019   Radio Scilly\u2019s reviewer said it was \"a beautifully written and perceptive book about the complexities of love and life in an island setting \u2026 A story of love, desire, loss and forgiveness that I found very thought provoking and moving.\"A Shield of Coolest Air (1992) won the David St John Thomas prize for fiction.  It revolves around a friendship between two young mothers, one of whom is a Somali who has had to flee from a civil war but been unable to get all her children out with her. The Egyptian writer Nawal el Saadawi said it was \"a beautiful piece of fiction, uncovering hidden realities.\" The Independent on Sunday reviewer said: \"So successfully has Molteno breathed life into her characters that we get a real sense of their vulnerability, their fury, their sadness and their astonishing resilience.\""

Vishram needed an Afghan who could tie a Pashtun turban on one of his characters. Rehman could do that, being a Pashtun, and that brought him to the screen for some lead roles. One of his major hits as hero was Pyar Ki Jeet with Suraiya, and the song-\"Ek Dil Ke Tukade Hazar Hue, Koi Yahan Gira, Koi Wahan Gira\" was a major hit. Badi Behen was another big hit with Suraiya. He was also interested in marrying Suraiya, along with many other suitors, though she was adamant in wanting to marry Dev Anand. He also worked with Madhubala in Paras (1949) and Pardes (1950); both the films were critical and commercial successes.\n\nInitially he played lead roles, but as time passed, he accepted supporting roles and made his mark in some hit films like  Pyaasa, Chaudhvin Ka Chand and Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam (in which he played a debauched zamindar, Chhote Sarkar), and Waqt which were some of his memorable roles, the first two with Guru Dutt, famous actor, producer, director.

The film was produced by GRB Entertainment, McAllister, and Luthringshausen, among others. It was released through Vimeo on Demand in July of that same year. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she described the project as an \"amazing experience\" and that seeing herself on screen left her \"cracking up at the fact that this is a real thing because I can\u2019t take myself seriously. So we\u2019re going to be hot messes, but I think we\u2019ll make it through.\" Also in 2015, McAllister made her writing debut with the autobiography Really Professional Internet Person, which was released in August 2015 and became a New York Times Best Seller.In February 2016, it was announced that McAllister would portray the leading role of Addie Fixler in the YouTube Red original series Foursome.

The series was released in March of that same year, and ran for four seasons until 2018. For her performance, she won the Streamy Award for Best Actress at the 6th Annual Streamy Awards, which was presented to her by frequent collaborator Andrea Russett.

In 1596 he established one of the first informal Jewish communities in Den Haag.After a delegation from the Dutch Republic visited Morocco to discuss a common alliance against Spain and the Barbary pirates, Sultan Zidan Abu Maali in 1608 appointed the merchant Samuel Pallache to interpret for his envoy Hammu ben Bashir to the Dutch government in The Hague. Officially, Pallache served as the sultan's \"agent\", not ambassador.On 23 June 1608 Pallache met stadtholder Maurice of Nassau and the States-General in The Hague to negotiate an alliance of mutual assistance against Spain. On 24 December 1610 the two nations signed the Treaty of Friendship and Free Commerce, an agreement recognising free commerce between the Netherlands and Morocco, and allowing the sultan to purchase ships, arms and munitions from the Dutch. This was one of the first official treaties between a European country and a non-Christian nation, after the 16th-Century treaties of the Franco-Ottoman alliance.The story goes that, one day, Pallache's horse-drawn carriage met the carriage of the Spanish ambassador in The Hague. The two carriages were unable to pass one another and, to cheers from onlookers, the Spanish ambassador's carriage had to make way for Pallache's carriage.In addition to his diplomatic affairs, Pallache also continued his activities as a merchant, actively trading between the Netherlands and Morocco. He also got permission from Prince Maurice for privateering activities. The goods obtained through these pirating activities were sold along the Moroccan coast."

A heavy storm and disease among his men forced him to seek refuge in an English port where, by request of the Spanish ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned. Eventually, Prince Maurice came to his aid and helped bring him back to the Netherlands. However, he had lost all his money by then and fell ill shortly thereafter.On 4 February 1616 he died in The Hague, and was buried with a gravestone (image) in the Beth Haim of Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, a \"cemetery of the Portuguese Jewish community\" in Ouderkerk aan de Amstel near Amsterdam. Thousands attended his funeral. The record for his grave spells his name as \"Palache\" and describes him as Morokkaans Gezant (Moroccan envoy).  It cites a birth place of Fez (Morocco). It states a burial date in Hebrew calendar Sebat 16, 5376 (4 February 1616). It lists three sons: Isaac, Moses, and David.

Rey intended for La aldea maldita to be a silent film, but, after completing production, decided to include sound. This necessitated additional shooting and synchronization in Paris. The decision to move sound production to France stemmed from Rey's dissatisfaction with the quality of the sound in his first talkie, Football, Love, and Bullfighting, in 1929.\nNo copy of the sound version of La aldea maldita exists today.Many film historians claim Rey was inspired by Russian Expressionist films during the making of La aldea maldita, particularly The Village of Sin by Olga Prebajenskaia, although the influence of this specific film on Rey is not universally agreed.\nRey incorporated such aspects of Russian Expressionism into his film as attention to shadow, camera \"walk-throughs\" (actors walk towards a camera followed by a shot of them moving away, as if they moved through it), and closeups on peasant faces."

His  younger  brother, Tore Strindberg (1882-1968), was a noted sculptor. His father's cousin was playwright and  novelist August Strindberg (1849\u20131912).\nStrindberg graduated from Norra Real in Stockholm during 1890. He received his Bachelor of Arts (fil.kand.) at Uppsala University in 1893. In 1895, received a post as lector at the  Stockholm University. In the spring of 1896 he traveled to Paris to study gas balloon flight.\nStrindberg was invited to the Arctic balloon expedition of 1897 to create a photographic aerial record of the arctic. Before perishing on Kvit\u00f8ya with Andr\u00e9e and Knut Fr\u00e6nkel, Strindberg recorded on film their long doomed struggle on foot to reach populated areas. When the remains of the expedition were discovered by the Bratvaag Expedition in 1930, five exposed rolls of film were found, one of them still in the camera. Docent John Hertzberg of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm managed to save 93 of the theoretically 240 frames. A selection of these photos were published along with the diaries of the expedition as Med \u00d6rnen mot Polen (Stockholm: Bonnier (1930); British edition The Andr\u00e9e diaries  (1931); American edition Andr\u00e9e's Story  (1932).

In an article from 2004, Tyrone Martinsson published some digitally enhanced versions of Strindberg's photos of the expedition, while lamenting the lack of care with which the original negatives were stored from 1944.Strindberg's so-called \"shorthand\" diary from the expedition has the form of messages to his fianc\u00e9e, Anna Charlier (1871-1949), and provides a more personal window on events than Andr\u00e9e's own diaries. Strindberg's body and those of the other two explorers were brought back to Sweden for a funeral with great honors.

He began his studies in law in 1948 in Milan, but left to take art courses at the Brera Fine Arts Academy. Soon, he started shooting reports on life of Milan's suburbs. Upon joining the regulars at the legendary \"Jamaica\" bar, he became part of the art and fashion community. In 1954 he was asked to cover the Venice Biennale, his first professional assignment. He went on to photograph every Venice Biennale through 1972 and to document his work in an art book. Mulas worked for such Italian publications as Settimo Giorno, Rivista Pirelli, Domus, Vogue.Mulas also did commercial work for advertising campaigns including clients such as Pirelli and Olivetti. In 1959 in Florence, he discovered Veruschka who later became a well-known model and artist. While covering the Spoleto Festival in 1962, he befriended sculptor Alexander Calder, who later became a major subject of Mulas' photography and writings.\nWhile photographing the 1964 Venice Biennale, Mulas met several American artists, art critics, and the art dealer Leo Castelli. This meeting led to his travel to New York City and his documentation of the Pop art scene. This trip to New York and Mulas' resulting book and exhibits, New York, the New Art Scene became his best known work. The exhibit included enlargements of Mulas' contact sheets and environmental portraits of Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Barnett Newman and Roy Lichtenstein. In the 1960s, he also worked in graphic design and wrote art books.In the late 1960s, Mulas became interested in theater and worked on many productions at Milan's Piccola Scala Theater and Teatro Comunale di Bologna. His photography of that period was full of experiments, in the shootings of that time he \"played\" with the composition, plot, framing, looking for a new artistic language. Mulas was described by his contemporaries as a man who, through photography, tried to understand the depths of human souls.In 1970, Mulas started working on the series La Verifiche that turned out to be his last \u2014 he was diagnosed with cancer in the same year. In early 1973, Mulas released his last book La Photographie, where he collected and summed up all his ideas and thoughts on art and photography. Aged 45, Mulas died in Milan on March 2, 1973."

In 1993 he received his bachelor's degree in applied science, industrial engineering from the University of Toronto.\nWhen he was 11, Ben began to take an interest in programming. One summer, Ben's father assigned him to write a database system (using DBASE) for their family business. With help from his father, Ben started Linguasoft Corp. and sold his system to bookstores and libraries. To this day, the Royal Ontario Museum is still using his software.\nBarely a teenager, Ben Chiu played table-tennis for the provincial (Ontario) team. Under the relentless training of renowned Yugoslavian coach Zoran Kosanovic, Ben won the Canadian National Championships (junior singles), Formosa Cup (men's singles) and took 2nd place at the 1984 U.S. Open (junior doubles).\nIn addition to high school, Ben also attended school for the gifted in visual arts. His art teacher once offered to buy one of his oil paintings but Ben declined. Some of his wildlife paintings have been displayed at the McMichael Gallery in Kleinburg, Ontario.

While buying computer hardware for the company, he discovered it was tedious to browse through thousands of magazine listings for the best deals.\nInstead, he cut the spines off publications like Computer Shopper and PC Magazine and keyed all the specs and prices into a database, page after page, one page at a time. After e-commerce sites began to appear on the Internet, Ben developed a web crawler that would automatically gather and update prices around the clock. This was to form the foundation for his new company.\nBen formally incorporated KillerApp, Corp. in 1995 and went on to pioneer the concept of online comparison shopping (also known as the price engine). This paradigm shift proved devastating to the computer publication industry. \"Print\" simply could not compete with the timely content and convenience of these specialized search engines.\nThe web crawlers at KillerApp ran 24/7, updating 1.5 million prices daily. Within two years, killerapp.com was receiving 14 million page views per month and 1/2 million monthly users. The site was also generating 150,000 leads per month for its base of 360 merchants.\nIn order to sustain the growth of its business, Ben raised two rounds of funding from angel investors that included: C.S. Ho (founder of Mitac/Synnex and honorary chairman of Computex); Charlene Wang (president of FIC and daughter of tycoon Y.C. Wang); Ming Chien (chairman of FIC) and \nCher Wang (chairperson of VIA Technologies and daughter of Y.C. Wang).\nIn 1998, Ziff-Davis approached Ben with a buy-out offer. He declined but instead brought in Deutsche Bank to produce competitive bids. A long M&A roadshow ensued. Ben held due diligence discussions with Microsoft, ZDNet, Yahoo!, CNET, Excite, Lycos and Inktomi. On March 23, 1999 he sold his company to CNET in a stock swap valued at US$54 million and joined CNET as the Director of Commerce Services."

Scalzi very narrowly retained his seat despite an 11.7 percent swing at the 1997 election reducing him to a margin of 0.7 percent.\nJoe Scalzi was a member of the public works committee that in 2001, made the deeply unpopular decision to sell the Payneham Civic Centre to JPMorgan Chase whereupon it was demolished and the land was used as the site for offices for financial services despite protests by residents.At the 2002 election, Scalzi had to defend the most marginal Liberal seat in the state, but managed to increase his margin to 1.3 percent.Despite this Scalzi remained a \"fairly low-key figure\" only obtaining a position as a parliamentary secretary in April 2004 when he became secretary for training.He was also one of a small number of Liberals to support a bill the cut the number of pokies in South Australia by 20 percent.Scalzi lost his seat in the 2006 election landslide to the ALP, giving his Labor opponent Grace Portolesi a 4.6 percent margin.  He failed to regain the seat at the 2010 election and lost Liberal preselection in Hartley to Vincent Tarzia for the 2014 election."

She sang alongside her mother and sister Caterina at court and across Italy, including cities such as Naples, Genoa, and Florence. She was admired not only for her skill as a musician, in which she almost overshadowed her mother, but also for her learning and refined manners. Baroni was honored by poets such as Fulvio Testi and Francesco Bracciolini, who addressed poems to her, as did some nobles, such as Annibale Bentivoglio and then-cardinal Pope Clement IX. These poems were collected and published as Applausi poetici alle glorie della Signora Leonora Baroni in 1639 and reprinted in 1641. John Milton later wrote a series of epigrams to her, entitled Ad Leonoram Romae canentem.In 1633, Baroni moved with her mother to Rome, where she sang at many salons in the Palazzo Barberini. On 27 May 1640 Baroni married Giulio Cesare Castellani, Cardinal Francesco Barberini's personal secretary.In February 1644, Baroni moved to the French court of Anne of Austria briefly, but by April 1645 she was back in Rome, where she was a chamber singer. Apparently she was not admired in Paris, perhaps because her Italian style of ornamented singing was too foreign to the court there.None of Baroni's compositions survive, but the French traveller and viol player Andr\u00e9 Maugars mentioned her compositions while praising the musical understanding of her singing."

He co-wrote the season six episode \"The Truth in the Myth\" with his writing partner Jonathan Goldstein. Sweets was ultimately killed in the season 10 premiere; Bones executive producer Stephen Nathan said Sweets was killed because Daley wanted time off to direct a movie, and he was concerned that Daley's absence would be too long, especially if the directing job led to other jobs.Daley was also featured in the music video for \"Mercy Kiss\" by Abandoned Pools.\nIn 2011, Daley and his writing partner Jonathan M. Goldstein wrote the black comedy Horrible Bosses. In 2013, Daley co-wrote The Incredible Burt Wonderstone with Goldstein; Daley also has a cameo in the film as a paramedic.

Carter's research focuses on neuropeptide and steroid hormones, including oxytocin, vasopressin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and estrogen. Her research program has discovered important new developmental functions for oxytocin and vasopressin, and implicated these hormones in the regulation of long-lasting neural and effects of early social experiences. She also has a long-standing concern regarding the consequences of medical manipulations for human development and parent-child interactions, including the use of \"pitocin\" \u2013 a synthetic version of oxytocin \u2013 to induce labor and consequences of breastfeeding for the mother and child. Most recently she has been examining the role of oxytocin and vasopressin in mental disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. Carter is also known for research on the physiological basis of social behavior, including studies that implicated oxytocin, vasopressin and hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (\"stress\") axis in the traits of monogamy including pair-bond formation.  She pioneered the physiological study of socially monogamous mammals, including the prairie vole. In collaboration with zoologist Lowell Getz, Carter documented the occurrence of social monogamy in prairie voles. Her studies in rodents helped to lay the foundation for the studies of behavioral and developmental effects of oxytocin and vasopressin in humans which are in progress. In collaboration with psychiatrist Margaret Altemus she conducted some of the first studies documenting the importance of breastfeeding in the regulation of maternal physiology."

He founded the Eufaula Indian Journal in 1901, the first Native American daily newspaper. For several years he published editorial letters known as the Fus Fixico Letters, written by a fictional figure who commented pointedly about Muscogee Nation, Indian Territory, and United States politics during the period of the dissolution of tribal governments and communal lands. He served as secretary to the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention and drafted much of the constitution for its proposed Native American state, but Congress rejected the proposal.

He was the oldest of twelve children, and his parents were Lewis Henderson \"Hence\" Posey, of Scots-Irish Muskogee Creek ancestry, from the Creek Berryhill family and Nancy (Phillips) Posey (Creek name Pohas Harjo), who was Muscogee Creek and a member of the Harjo family.The Creek have a matrilineal kinship system, by which Posey and his siblings were considered born into his mother's Wind Clan of the tribal town of Tuskegee. They took their status from her, and property and hereditary positions were passed through her line. Posey's father Lewis H. Posey was born to Scots/Irish/Creek family, but he identified as Creek. He had been orphaned at an early age and raised in the Creek Nation; he spoke the Muscogee language fluently; and he was made a member of the Broken Arrow tribal town. Young Alexander and his siblings spoke Muscogee as their first language. As they grew older, their father insisted they speak English as well; when Posey was fourteen, his father would punish him if he spoke Muscogee. From that time, Posey received a formal education, including three years at Bacone Indian University in Muskogee, Oklahoma.\nIn 1896 at the age of 23, Posey married Minnie Harris, a schoolteacher. Together they had three children, Yahola Irving, Pachina Kipling, and Wynema Torrans, each with a middle name drawn from one of the couple's literary heroes."

In 1895, he represented the Wind Clan as a member of the Creek National Council. He was also the director of a Creek orphanage.\nIn 1901, Posey edited the journal Eufaula Indian Journal. He gained national recognition for founding the first Indian-published daily newspaper.\nIn 1906, Posey was secretary for the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention, called to draft a constitution for a state to be majority Native American. According to the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma, he is credited with having written most of that constitution. The Native Americans hoped to gain a state of their own, in the period when whites were pushing for the Oklahoma and Indian territories to be admitted as a state to the Union. The Native Americans were not successful. Their tribal structures were dissolved as part of extinguishing Native American land title in what became the state of Oklahoma."

        "content": "As Posey honed his satirical skills, he created a fictional persona, Fus Fixico (Muscogee Creek for \"Heartless Bird\"), whose editorial letters were published in the Indian Journal. Fus Fixico was represented as a full-blood Muscogee traditionalist, whose chatty letters were about his everyday life or detailed accounts that he had heard the fictional Muscogee medicine man Hotgun share with an audience of Creek elders: Kono Harjo, Tookpafka Micco, and Wolf Warrior. These monologues are written in Creek dialect.The Fus Fixico Letters have aspects of nostalgia but are primarily sharp political commentary about Muscogee Nation, Indian Territory, and United States politics. This was a time of political upheaval because Creek and other tribes' communal lands were being broken up into individual household allotments under the Dawes Act, to extinguish land title in preparation for statehood. The Curtis Act of 1898 dismantled tribal governments and institutions, also in preparation for Indian Territory to become part of the state of Oklahoma.\nExperienced politicians from the Five Civilized Tribes met to draft a constitution to establish  an indigenous-controlled State of Sequoyah, but their proposals were rejected by the US Federal Government. Posey served as secretary for the 1906 State of Sequoyah convention. His Fus Fixico letters from 1902 to 1908 poked fun as statehood was debated. Various US newspapers proposed syndicating the Fus Fixico letters nationwide, but Posey refused. His readership was within Indian Territory, and he did not believe a non-Native audience would understand the humor.So-called dialect literature was extremely popular at the dawn of the 20th century. Usually dialect literature was based on African-American dialect. The Posey family had also avidly read Robert Burns, who wrote poetry in the Scots language. Posey's father read such dialect writers as Max Adler, Josh Billings, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and James Whitcomb Riley. Alexander Posey saw dialects as a means of expressing Muscogee oratory styles in English; he did not care for dialect writers who tried to adopt it as part of a popular trend: \"Those cigar store Indian dialect stories...will fool no one who has lived 'six months in the precinct.' Like the wooden aborigine, they are the product of a white man's factory, and bear no resemblance to the real article.\""

        "content": "Having joined the Army (The Royal Fusiliers), Grantham was soon posted to West Germany, where he quickly found himself in debt to army colleagues. He resorted to criminal activities in his attempt to clear the debt.\nOn 3 December 1966, Grantham attempted to rob a taxi driver, Felix Reese, in Osnabr\u00fcck, Lower Saxony, by threatening him at gunpoint and demanding money. In a struggle between the two men, Grantham shot Reese, who died from a gunshot wound to the head. Grantham was arrested and charged with murder.In his statement to the police following his arrest, Grantham said that he did not know the gun was loaded and it had gone off during the struggle, which would have resulted in a conviction for manslaughter had a jury believed this version of events. However, at his trial in April 1967, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Although he had committed the murder in West Germany, he served the entirety of his sentence in British prisons. This was because soldiers and officers convicted of any criminal offence that warrants a sentence of over two years were automatically transferred to Her Majesty's Prison Service, since they are also automatically dishonourably discharged.\nGrantham was released in 1977, having served 10 years inside. While he was in Leyhill Prison in Gloucestershire, he performed in several plays for inmates and members of the public, and edited the prison newspaper. He was encouraged to get more involved in acting professionally by the disgraced Labour politician T. Dan Smith, who was also an inmate at Leyhill in the mid-1970s. Grantham also met actress Louise Jameson during her visit to Leyhill near the end of his imprisonment; she had also encouraged him to take up acting, and he became good friends with her."

He then moved to London, where from 1897 to 1899 he was an assistant first to Richard Creed, then to William Alfred Pite, and finally to Edwin Landseer Lutyens. During these years he studied at the South Kensington Schools of the Royal College of Art. He passed the Royal Institute of British Architects qualifying examination and was admitted an Associate on 30 November 1903, having been proposed by Pite, John William Simpson and Lacy William Ridge.Ayrton was in practice on his own from 1899, and in 1903 was at 14, Belsize Park Gardens, London. One of his early buildings was a house called Hall Ingle, at Heath End, Checkendon (1902), \"...by Mr. O. Maxwell Ayrton, for, and decorated by, Arthur Hacker, Esq., ARA\". Hacker painted Ayrton's wife and exhibited the portrait at the Royal Academy in 1902.In 1905, Ayrton joined John William Simpson's practice, and from then on he carried out most of the firm's design work. He became a partner in the firm in 1910 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1920, having been proposed by his old master Lutyens and by Sir Aston Webb, who at the time was President of the Royal Academy.Simpson's practice included much work for schools, and Ayrton was the architect of a new chapel for Gresham's School, Holt, constructed in knapped flint and limestone (flushwork), with two angle turrets and an embattled parapet, between 1912 and 1916, which is now a listed building.\nAyrton's most notable public building from his years with Simpson was the old Wembley Stadium, a simple structure in reinforced concrete which they designed together, built between 1921 and 1923 for the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park of 1924 to 1925. It had echoes of the Olympic stadium of 1908 at White City. Simpson received a knighthood for their Exhibition work, while as a result of it Ayrton came into an association with the project's civil engineer, Owen Williams, and this led to their working together on the design of Williams's bridges in Scotland.In 1928 Ayrton's partnership with Simpson was dissolved. Although by then over seventy, Simpson continued his practice, taking into partnership Frank W. Knight and Henley Cornford, while Ayrton returned to private practice. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics.Ayrton's National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, London, is an imposing copper-roofed building. Although construction began in 1937, it was delayed by the Second World War, and the opening ceremony in the presence of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth did not take place until 5 May 1950.\nAyrton was still in practice when he died in 1960 at the age of eighty-five. The Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects reported that \"Mr R. Courtenay Theobald, following the death of his partner Mr Maxwell Ayrton in February 1960, will practise under his own name from 9 Church Row, Hampstead, London NW3 and 21A Heath Street, NW3.\""

Schor responded to the rumors stating that \"If I run for mayor, it's because I want to be mayor, not because I need a job,\" he said. Schor added that he'd only want to be mayor if he concludes \"it's best for the city.\"In February 2017, Schor announced his primary run for mayor of Lansing. Around the same time, Mayor Bernero said in a press release that he was \"prepared\" to reapply for \"my job\" for a fourth term. A few days later, Bernero announced that he would not be seeking a fourth term so he can spend more time with his family. Schor transferred the balance of his state representative campaign committee into a committee for his run for mayor, having nearly $70,000 for campaign finance at the start of the campaign. In the 2017 primary election for mayor of Lansing, Schor and Judi Brown Clarke were the top two finishers over candidates Michael Joseph Gillenkirk, Harold J Leeman Jr, and Danny Trevino. Schor received 8,402 votes, which made up 68.37% of the primary votes. Schor and Brown Clarke, the top-two primary candidates, went on to face off in the general election.\nIn the mayoral election on November 9, 2017, Schor was elected mayor of Lansing, defeating Judi Brown Clarke, 72.2% to 27.8%.

His recent work on branched chain fatty acids is particularly noteworthy. He showed, for example, that in cows fed grass silage the phytanic acid found in their plasma lipids originates from chlorophyll. He then went on to discover other novel branched-chain acids in sheep fed carbohydrate-rich diets. These compounds are of great significance arising, as they do, from excess propionate produced by rumen fermentation. This occurs because the conversion of propionate into methylmalonyl-Coenzyme A (a vitamin B-12 - dependent reaction) is rate-limiting and hence the ability of the animal to channel propionate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle is considerably reduced. This work opens up a completely new field of lipid biochemistry. \"The 55th International Conference on the Bioscience of Lipids, will be held in his memory."

Bakewell.She played a major role with her husband in 1957 in writing the \"American Bar Association's Report on Communist Tactics, Strategy, and Objectives.\" Donald T. Critchlow says it \"became not only one of the most widely read documents ever produced by the ABA, it was probably the single most widely read publication of the grassroots anticommunist movement.\"In 1952, Schlafly ran for Congress as a Republican in the majority Democratic 24th congressional district of Illinois and lost to Charles Melvin Price by 117,408 votes (64.80%) to 63,778 (35.20%). Schlafly's campaign was low-budget and promoted heavily through the local print media, and the major munitions manufacturers John M. Olin and Spencer Truman Olin, and the Texas oil billionaire H. L. Hunt.She attended her first Republican National Convention in 1952, and continued to attend each following convention. As part of the Illinois delegation of the 1952 Republican convention, Schlafly endorsed U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft to be the party nominee for the presidential election. At the 1960 Republican National Convention, Schlafly helped lead a revolt of \"moral conservatives\" who opposed Richard Nixon's stance \"against segregation and discrimination.\" Schlafly was the Republican nominee for Illinois's 24th congressional district again in 1960, losing again to Price, this time by 144,560 votes (72.22%) to 55,620 (27.79%).\nShe came to national attention when millions of copies of her self-published book A Choice Not an Echo were distributed in support of Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign, especially in California's hotly fought winner-take-all-delegates GOP primary. In it, Schlafly denounced the Rockefeller Republicans in the Northeast, accusing them of corruption and globalism. Critics called the book a conspiracy theory about \"secret kingmakers\" controlling the Republican Party.\nSchlafly had previously been a member of the John Birch Society, but quit, and later denied she had been a member because she feared her association with the organization would damage her book's reputation. By mutual agreement her books were not mentioned in the John Birch Society's magazine, and the distribution of her books by the society was handled so as to mask their involvement. The society was able to dispense 300,000 copies of A Choice Not an Echo in California prior to the June 2, 1964 GOP primary. Gardiner Johnson, Republican National Committee for California, stated that the distribution of her book in California was a major factor in Goldwater's winning the nomination.In 1967, Schlafly lost a bid for the presidency of the National Federation of Republican Women against the more moderate candidate Gladys O'Donnell of California. Outgoing NFRW president and future United States Treasurer Dorothy Elston of Delaware worked against Schlafly in the campaign.In 1970, she ran unsuccessfully for Illinois's 23rd congressional district, losing to Democratic incumbent George E. Shipley by 91,158 votes (53.97%) to 77,762 (46.04%). She never sought public office again.\nAmerican feminists made their greatest bid for national attention at the 1977 National Women's Conference in Houston; however, historian Marjorie J. Spruill argues that the anti-feminists led by Schlafly organized a highly successful counter-conference, the Pro-Life, Pro-Family Rally, to protest the National Women's Conference and make it clear that feminists did not speak for them. At their rally at the Astro Arena they had an overflow of over 15,000 people, and announced the beginning of a pro-family movement to oppose politicians who had been supporting feminism and liberalism, and to promote \"family values\" in American politics, and so moved the Republican Party to the right and defeated the ratification of the ERA."

In the days before the graduation ceremony, Washington University Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton explained the trustees' decision to award Schlafly an honorary degree with the following statement of disclaimer:In bestowing this degree, the University is not endorsing Mrs. Schlafly's views or opinions; rather, it is recognizing an alumna of the University whose life and work have had a broad impact on American life and have sparked widespread debate and controversies that in many cases have helped people better formulate and articulate their own views about the values they hold.\nAt the May 16, 2008, commencement ceremony, Schlafly was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, yet faculty and students protested to rescind Schlafly's honorary degree. During the ceremony, hundreds of the 14,000 people in attendance, including one-third of the graduating class and some faculty, silently stood and turned their backs to Schlafly in protest. In the days before the commencement there were protests regarding the awarding of an honorary degree; Schlafly described the protesters as \"a bunch of losers\". Moreover, after the ceremony, Schlafly said that the protesters were \"juvenile\" and \"I'm not sure they're mature enough to graduate.\" As planned, Schlafly did not address the graduating class, nor did any other honored guest, except for the commencement speaker, news commentator Chris Matthews of MSNBC."

In \u0141\u00f3d\u017a he ordered the construction of the Jewish ghetto on 10 December 1939, a measure he described as only temporary, adding that ultimately the Nazis intended to \"burn out this plague dump\".In early October 1941, Uebelhoer drew the ire of Reinhard Heydrich when he vehemently protested against the intended deportation of 60,000 German Jews to the already overcrowded ghetto.  In a letter to Uebelhoer, Heydrich threatened to draw \"appropriate conclusions\" if Uebelhoer did not change his stance.  Through negotiations with Adolf Eichmann, the number eventually reached was 20,000 Jews and 5,000 Gypsies sent to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, with tens of thousands sent to other ghettos.  In November that year, to assuage Uebelhoer's qualms about ghetto arson started by Gypsies, Heinrich Himmler advised Uebelhoer to shoot ten Gypsies for every fire that broke out within the ghetto.  Those Gypsies who did not perish in the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto were killed by gas vans in January 1942 in Che\u0142mno.Uebelhoer was dismissed from his post as governor of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in December 1942 after being accused of embezzlement by Arthur Greiser.

Norman was named Producer of the Year by Cashbox in 1989.\nDuring the 1990s, Nashville became home to a migration of singer/songwriters and the city gradually became known for embracing that genre. In 1990 Norman added his production talents to this emergent trend, producing the breakthrough self-titled Warner Bros/Reprise album by singer/songwriter Beth Nielsen Chapman. He resumed duties for Nielsen Chapman's follow-up, You Hold the Key (Warner Reprise, 1993)."

Howard was the leading rider at Louisiana Downs for several consecutive years in the late 1980s.\nAs is the case with most jockeys, Don Howard experienced several serious injuries.  In 1993, he suffered a nearly fatal accident while racing at Louisiana Downs.  In the final stretch riding Police Cat, the horse broke its leg resulting in the horse falling into a somersault.  Don was able to untangle himself from his horse only to be trampled by an apprentice's horse that was several lengths behind.  Don was unconscious for nearly an hour and initially was not expected to survive.  He suffered his fourth severe concussion in six months and had a compound fracture of his right humerus, the same arm that was nearly amputated when he was 14 due to a hay equipment accident.  In 1994, Don Howard attempted to return to horse racing, only to discover that the fractured humerus had not healed. The non-union fracture required several additional surgeries.\nIn 1997, Howard returned to horse racing in New Mexico and then back to Oaklawn Park.  His circuit eventually included Prairie Meadows Racetrack in Altoona, Iowa. Don Howard was very successful at Prairie Meadows and was consistently in the top 3 jockeys in the number of wins as well as earnings.\nHe never officially retired, but has not raced since 2002."

        "content": "After the April Revolution, a citizens' and students' uprising against the Syngman Rhee dictatorship and election fraud in 1960, he engineered the May 16 coup, led by Major General Park Chung Hee in 1961 with his fellow Korea Military Academy (8th graduating class) classmates. He served in several high-profile offices, including chairman of the ruling Democratic Republican Party during Park's eighteen year presidency until his assassination in 1979.\nIn 1965, he spearheaded the establishment of diplomatic relations with Japan following the conclusion of Imperial Japanese rule of Korea. Japanese rule of Daeil Cheongoogwon was used as seed money for economic development of Pohang Steel and the Gyeongbu Expressway to achieve the Miracle on the Han River. The poverty of 60 dollars income to 30,000 dollars strong economy of South Korea. Income went from 60 South Korean Won to 30,000 South Korean Won, representing a robust economy.\nIn 1963, he founded the Democratic Republican Party which helped President Park Chung Hee strengthen his power and his party maintained supermajority during his presidency. From 1971 to 1975, he served as Prime Minister of South Korea. He assumed the same position from 1998 to 2000 during Kim Dae-jung's presidency as part of the Alliance DJP.\nIn 1987, Kim Jong-pil staged a political comeback by creating a new political party known as the New Democratic Republican Party (NDRP). Most of the key party members and backers were conservatives who had served with him under the Park Chung Hee administration. Key members included Choi Gak-kyu, Kim Dong Kun (\uae40\ub3d9\uadfc (1930)), Koo Ja-choon, Lee Hee-il, Kim Yong-tae, Cho Yong-jik, Kim Yong-hwan, Kim Moon-won, etc. As chairman of the NDRP, he ran for president and lost to Roh Tae-woo of the ruling Democratic Justice Party (DJP). In the 13th National Assembly legislative elections held in April 1988, the NDRP won 35 seats out of the 299-seat National Assembly.\nIn January 1990, Kim Jong-pil led the merger of his party with the ruling DJP and opposition party, Kim Young-sam\u2019s Reunification Democratic Party (RDP) to create the Democratic Liberal Party (DLP). Jong-pil became the Executive Chairman of the newly formed DLP and Kim Young-sam became the party's presidential nominee in the 1992 South Korea presidential elections, which he won.\nThe outline of Kim Jong-pil's positions hardly describes the skills of the politician in navigating the complexities of South Korean politics. Scholars note that he mastered the art of political coalitions. This is demonstrated in the way he was able to reemerge politically stronger after suffering various political setbacks. For instance, by October 1997, Kim Jong-pil's popularity had fluctuated, hovering between 2.9 percent and 4.6 percent, which was attributed to his reputation as being an integral member of the authoritarian rule of Park Chung-hee. part. This was further aggravated by the conservative party's image problem, which was identified with old politicians who have ethical flaws. Also, it is important to note that his main regional power base, the Chungcheon province, lacks the intense and unwavering loyalty to its political 'leaders' that is often found among those from neighbouring regions such as Chollado or Gyeongsangdo provinces.\nThrough clever political maneuvering, however, Kim Jong-pil struck a power-sharing deal with Kim Dae-jung's National Congress for New Politics, known as the DJP Alliance, which allowed him to choose half of the cabinet members of the Kim Dae-Jung administration. The deal also included his appointment as prime minister in March 1998 during Kim Dae-jung's presidency (1998-2003) for the second time.\nIn 2004, he announced his retirement from politics after his bid for a tenth term in the National Assembly failed and his party, the United Liberal Democrats, was unable to gain a sizable number of seats in the 2004 parliamentary election. The party later merged into the Grand National Party.\nKim Jong Pil was the last of the \"Three Kims,\" which refers to himself, Kim Young-sam, and Kim Dae-jung, who dominated South Korea's politics for decades. Fate had him elude the presidency on several occasions, earning him the title \"the perennial no. 2 man.\" It is important to note Chungcheon province, JP's main regional power base, lacks the intense and unwavering loyalty to its political leaders that is often found among those from neighboring regions, such as Chollado and Gyeongsangdo provinces."

Although he wrote as a scientist, his objective attitude toward Native Americans contrasted with other writing, which was often either romantic or discriminatory. He largely accepted the goal of Indian assimilation as outlined by reformers of the era. But, he was a witness to what the costs were to the traditional peoples and reported on issues and changes with objectivity.During the late 1800s Native Americans were under harsh attack in many areas, and essentially subjects of genocide by the United States of America. The Indian Wars, intended to suppress tribal resistance to European-American settlement of the West, was generally presented as required because Native Americans made unjustified attacks on pioneers. Mooney wrote more objectively about issues in the West.\nMooney took the time to observe various Native American tribes in the way they lived on a daily basis. Prior to his work, most people outside reservations learned about issues only from a distance. He wanted to learn and to teach other Americans about their culture. He published several books based on his studies of Native American tribes."

The Archbishop of York at the time was Richard le Scrope, a former Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, and the window was funded by Walter Skirlaw, also previously Bishop of Coventry, so it seems possible both men would have recommended Thornton based on their knowledge of his work in his home town.\nThornton was made a freeman of York in 1410, but was known to be back living in the St John's Bridges area of Coventry (now known as Burges) by 1413. He appears again in 1433, when he received further payment from the dean and chapter of York, and was recorded as holding property there.It has been suggested, though without any strong evidence, that Thornton was the son of a \"John Coventre\", a glazier in the royal glass-painting workshops at Westminster in 1351 and 1352, who later assisted in setting up windows at Windsor Castle for Edward III of England. Thornton could have worked as an assistant to his father before rising to the position of designer and draughtsman."

Niesen could teach several subjects including mathematics and was an able administrator. During his time at St. Xavier's High School, Patna, students performed extremely well academically and won distinctions of various sorts like Rhodes Scholarships.\nIn 1949, when Fr.

Niesen introduced the house system at St. Xavier's High School, Patna in which the boys were divided into four houses- Lions, Leopards, Tigers & Panthers. The houses competed against each other in sports and other extra-curricular activities. The system exists at St. Xavier's High School, Patna to this very day and was also replicated at Godavari St. Xavier's, where Niesen later moved. A great sports man himself, Niesen encouraged his students to participate in sports. He formed leagues in all sports and there were tournaments organised throughout the school year that culminated in Annual Sports Day.By 1954, Godavari St. Xavier's was well established and another school at Jawalakhel had been opened for the primary students. Niesen moved to Nepal to take up the work of principal of Godavari High School and superior of the Jesuits in Nepal. He also continued the task of teaching mathematics in all the senior classes. Later, Fr. Niesen moved to Jawalakhel to take over the junior school and built the \"new\" building at Jawalakhel, one of the first structures in Nepal using the then novel reinforced concrete pillars and slabs.Fr. Niesen suffered from asthma, and later emphysema. By 1968 Fr. Niesen's health had deteriorated, he was asked by the provincial to move to Delhi to take over the junior section of St. Xavier's School, Delhi, where he put all his skills to good use to build up that school, a task he continued until his death in March 1974."

In 2002, Baxley defeated Bill Armistead in the election as elected lieutenant governor, having received more votes than either candidate for governor that year.  She also served as a delegate to the 1996 Democratic National Convention, which met in Chicago to renominate the Clinton-Gore ticket, which lost in Alabama.\nIn 2005, Baxley announced plans to run for governor in 2006. Her main opponent in the primary was former Governor Don Siegelman. In large part because of Siegelman's indictment for bribery and racketeering, she was able to secure important endorsements from the Alabama Democratic Conference, the New South Coalition, and the Alabama State Employees Association.  Despite running a relatively low-profile campaign, she coasted to a win in the primary election on June 6 with 60 percent of the vote. Baxley was an underdog in the general election, however, against incumbent Republican Bob Riley, trailing by as much as 30 points in some polls. Baxley proposed a raise in the minimum wage of $1 per hour, which generated some criticism from her opponents.  She was heavily outspent in the campaign by Riley and pointed to Riley's receipt of large contributions from recipients of industrial development subsidies.  Baxley lost to Riley, 58-42 percent.Baxley's term as lieutenant governor ended in 2007, and she was succeeded by fellow Democrat and former Governor Jim Folsom, Jr., of Cullman. Making a political comeback in 2008, Baxley defeated Republican Twinkle A. Cavanaugh to become president of the Alabama Public Service Commission. She replaced the retiring Jim Sullivan. She was then defeated by Cavanaugh in 2012 during her bid for reelection.In each of her campaigns for office, Baxley utilized media bearing the title of the iconic CBS situation comedy starring Lucille Ball, I Love Lucy."

        "content": "After dropping out of law school at the University of Amsterdam, Van Gogh became a stage manager. His self-proclaimed passion was filmmaking, and he made his debut as a director with the movie Luger (1981).\nHe was awarded a Gouden Kalf for Blind Date (1996) and In het belang van de staat (\"In the Interest of the State\", 1997). For the latter, he also received a \"Certificate of Merit\" from the San Francisco International Film Festival. As an actor, he appeared in the film, De noorderlingen (\"The Northerners\", 1992). He made numerous films (see below), many on political themes. From the 1990s, Van Gogh also worked in television.\nHis last book (2003) was Allah weet het beter (\"Allah Knows Best\"), in which he strongly condemned Islam. He was a well-known critic of Islam, particularly after the Iranian Revolution and the September 11 attacks. He supported the nomination of writer Ayaan Hirsi Ali for the Dutch parliament, who was elected. Born in Somalia, she had immigrated to the Netherlands to escape an arranged marriage. She became a writer and liberal (former PvdA Labour Party) politician.\nIn the 1980s, Van Gogh became a newspaper columnist. Through the years he used his columns to express his frustration with politicians, actors, film directors, writers and other people he considered to be part of \"the establishment\". He delighted in provocation and became a controversial figure, frequently criticising Islamic cultures. He used his website, De Gezonde Roker (\"The Healthy Smoker\"), to express harsh criticism of multicultural society. He said the Netherlands was so rife with social turmoil that it was in danger of turning into \"something Belfast-like\"."

Mazarin arrested him and a number of other members of the Paris Parlement for their politics on 26 August 1648.  In response, the people of Paris rebelled and Mazarin was forced to free Broussel two days later.  This insurrection touched off the first Fronde.  Broussel was appointed Provost of the merchants of Paris (effectively, the mayor) in July 1652, but he resigned in September in order to make it easier to end the civil war he had helped to start.\n\n\n== References =="

Roberts, and the writers William Carman Roberts and Elizabeth Roberts MacDonald, were his siblings.He published his first poem in 1889, when he was eleven, in the New York Independent (where his cousin Bliss Carman was working), and his first prose piece (a comparison of the Battle of Waterloo and the Battle of Gettysburg) in the Century two years later.Roberts attended Fredericton Collegiate School, though (since school records were lost in a fire) the exact years are unknown. He later went to University of New Brunswick (UNB), but left without graduating. He published poetry in UNB's University Magazine.\nIn 1897 he moved to New York City, living with his brothers Charles and William and working at The Independent. In 1898 the magazine sent him to Cuba, as a special correspondent, to cover the Spanish\u2013American War. While on the island he contracted malaria\u2014he was sent back to New York and consulted specialists, who sent him back to Fredericton \"to die.\"An unnamed surgeon saved Roberts's life, and he was nursed back to heath by Frances Seymour Allen (whom he would subsequently marry). The next year he travelled to Newfoundland, where he helped to found and edit The Newfoundland Magazine. He published his first book of poetry Northand Lyrics, an anthology edited by Charles G.D. Roberts and featuring his three siblings in 1899, and his first novel, The House of Isstens, in 1900.\nIn 1901 Roberts sailed on a barkentine to Brazil. In 1902 he returned to Fredericton and briefly edited a second magazine, The Kit-Bag.Roberts married Frances Seymour Allen in November 1903, and they had a two-year honeymoon in Barbados where their first child was born. They would have four children: William Goodridge, Dorothy Mary Gostwick, Theodora Frances Bliss and Loveday (who died as an infant).Roberts averaged three novels a year from 1908 until 1914. At that time his \"many novels of adventure and romance\" already enjoyed a \"wide popularity in English-speaking lands.\"A former militiaman, Roberts re-enlisted in 1914 when World War I broke out, serving as a lieutenant in the 12th Canadian Infantry Battalion, commanded by Lt.-Col. Harry Fulton McLeod of Fredericton\u2014Roberts' entire family followed him to England. When the 12th Battalion was assigned to a reserve and training roll in early 1915, Roberts was transferred to a position perhaps better fitted to his combination of military knowledge and literary skill. \"In the summer of 1915, he was transferred to the Canadian War Records Office at the request of Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook. Roberts wrote official reports and battlefield accounts and published three works in collaboration with others.\" He was promoted captain early in 1916.\nWhen Roberts was in Europe he left his manuscripts and papers, including work not yet published, with a Dr. Wainwright in Saint John, who stored them in his basement. They were destroyed in the spring of 1919 when the Saint John River flooded.In 1929 Roberts wrote a weekly column for the Saint John Telegraph-Journal, \"Under the Sun.\" From April through September 1930 he edited another small magazine, Acadie.In 1932 he undertook his last major sea cruise, sailing through the Panama Canal to Vancouver and back. The same year he did a cross-Canada reading tour, which \"culminated with festivities in Vancouver.\"Roberts moved to Toronto in 1935, and in 1937 briefly edited another magazine, Spotlight. In 1939 he relocated to Aylmer, Quebec, where he briefly founded another magazine, Swizzles.He returned to New Brunswick in 1941, and in 1945 moved to Digby, Nova Scotia, where he would die eight years later. He is buried beside Charles G.D. Roberts and Bliss Carman in Fredericton's Forest Hill Cemetery."

Roberts's \"poetry and fiction, staggering in sheer quantity and variety, show at their best Roberts's most enduring gifts: in his poetry a love of nature well served by a keen eye for local color and detail, a good ear for clean, clear rhythm and rhyme, and a forceful, uncluttered narrative line; and in fiction a talent for presenting his abiding perception of universal struggles between good and evil either in mythic tales of adventure or in regional stories animated by local settings, customs, and dialects.\"Of the poems in his 1926 collection, The Lost Shipmate, The Encyclopedia of Literature commented: \"Had this volume appeared forty years earlier it might have won for Theodore a reputation equal to that of his brother Charles or of Bliss Carman. Poems such as 'The sandbar' and 'Magic' are unmatched in Canadian poetry for a facility and clarity of image suggestive of high-realist painting."

        "content": "LeDoux ran for State House as a Democrat in Kodiak in 2000, losing in the general election to Gary Stevens by a 44 percent to 55 percent margin. LeDoux served as mayor of the Kodiak Island Borough March 2001 through October 2004. LeDoux was then elected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 2004. Taking office in January 2005, she served two terms in the Alaska State Legislature, through January 2009 and was a recipient of the Toll Fellowship in 2006. While in the legislature LeDoux served as co-chair of both the Fisheries and the Community and Regional Affairs Committees. She was also a member of the Labor and Commerce, and Resources committees.In October 2007, LeDoux announced her candidacy for the United States House of Representatives in Alaska's At-large congressional district in 2008, challenging 18-term congressman Don Young and Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell. LeDoux was dubbed a spoiler and placed a distant third in the primary, garnering less than 10 percent of the vote. The only part of the state she carried was her former legislative district, by a plurality. Ledoux said in July 2009 that she would not run again in 2010 if Young sought re-election.After her second term in the house ended in January 2009, LeDoux moved to east Anchorage from Kodiak Island in 2009, and ran for State House in her new district in the 2010 elections. She lost to Pete Petersen in the general election by 5 percent (47 percent to 52 percent). In 2012, LeDoux's presumptive Democratic opponent withdrew after winning an uncontested primary, and was replaced by Kay Rollison. LeDoux beat Rollison in the general election. She defeated retired colonel Laurie Hummel to represent District 15 (East Anchorage) in 2014 (52 percent to 47 percent). LeDoux is her own single largest campaign contributor, by a factor of more than 10 times.After being elected in 2016 to her 5th non-consecutive term in the state house, LeDoux joined a majority coalition of Democrats, Independents and two other Republicans, with an avowed goal of ameliorating the state's budget deficit, the latter a product of declining oil revenues, budgeting, and prior taxation restructuring. LeDoux was chosen to chair the house Rules Committee. Alaska state Republican Party chair, Tuckerman Babcock, informed LeDoux by letter that the party will recruit and support a primary opponent against her in 2018. After joining the majority coalition in 2016, LeDoux expressed confidence that she would be representing the needs of her constituents saying \"We're hired to do a job, and the purpose of our job is not to keep our job. It's to actually do something.\"."

An expert swimmer, she handled all of Lamour's swimming and diving scenes shot on location in Pago Pago, American Samoa, and Catalina Island. In one scene, Shanley lowered her sarong and was filmed diving into a lagoon in the nude. After The Hurricane became a hit, Shanley was hired to double for Lamour in her subsequent films.Shanley went on to double for a succession of leading actresses, including Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind, Paulette Goddard in Reap the Wild Wind and Unconquered, Donna Reed in It's a Wonderful Life, Betty Hutton in The Perils of Pauline, and Sandra Dee in A Summer Place. She also doubled for Jane Powell, Olivia de Havilland, Ida Lupino, Veronica Lake, Joan Fontaine, Frances Dee, and Sonja Henie. She appeared in more than 100 films. In 1947, Jerry Fairbanks produced The Stunt Girl, a short documentary film highlighting her career to date.Shanley performed a wide range of stunts. In the escape from Atlanta scene in Gone with the Wind, she rode in a horse-drawn carriage through the burning warehouses of the railroad depot. In the graduation party scene in It's a Wonderful Life, she fell into a swimming pool that lay underneath the retractable floor of a high school gymnasium. In Unconquered, she and stuntman Ted Mapes rode a canoe on the rapids then jumped out to grasp an overhanging tree limb; she also sustained an attack of \"flaming arrows\" in the same film. In To Catch a Thief, Shanley leaped from rooftop to rooftop, then rolled down a slanted roof and broke her fall. She had also \"jumped out of bombers, been chased by lions, clawed by tigers, and thrown overboard into icy ocean waters at night\", and served as the target for a knife-and-hatchet-thrower. Shanley said stair falls were her favorite stunt, explaining, \"They are the most rewarding because everyone thinks they look great. They're quite simple, actually\".In 1981, the Chicago Tribune said that Shanley, then aged 72, \"may be the oldest working stuntwoman in America\". It credited her long and injury-free career to her conditioning program, which involved swimming 50 laps daily and playing beach volleyball."

Three of the six other survivors were also said to have become saints. While others survived through good fortune, Derfel survived \"by his strength alone\". \nDerfel is said to have been a noted warrior in medieval Welsh poetry. Tudur Penllyn wrote: \n\nDerfel mewn rhyfel, gwnai'i wayw'n rhyfedd, Darrisg dur yw'r wisg, dewr yw'r osgedd.\n(\"Derfel in war, he would work his spear wondrously, steel covering is the garment, brave is the appearance.\")According to Lewys Glyn Cothi:\n\n\"When there were at Camlan men and fighting and a host being slain, Derfel with his arms was dividing steel there in two\".After Camlan, Derfel is unanimously held in Welsh tradition to have entered the religious life. After a possible stint as a wandering hermit, he is said to have entered the monastery of Llantwit. He was also associated with Llandderfel in Gwynedd, named after and said to have founded by him. He is also said to have served as the abbot of Ynys Enlli, Bardsey Island, succeeding his cousin St. Cadfan. He is said to have died of natural causes on 6 April 560."

Derfel was depicted as a warrior in full armour riding a horse rather than as an ecclesiastic. The Llandderfel image was removed and dismantled by order of Thomas Cromwell during the English Reformation and used to burn a Catholic priest, John Forest, at Smithfield in London in 1536.

He started his political career in the Alliance of the Socialist Youth of Slovenia (ZSMS), the largely autonomous youth and student organisation, many times in opposition to the League of Communists of Slovenia.\nIn the first free elections in Slovenia, he was elected to the Slovenian Parliament as member of the Alliance of the Socialist Youth of Slovenia \u2013 Liberal Party (later renamed to Liberal Democratic Party) and became Deputy Foreign Minister (1990\u20131993) in first democratic Government of Slovenia ruled by the DEMOS coalition. He was re-elected to the Parliament in 1992 and 1996 on the list of the ruling Liberal Democracy of Slovenia. Between 1993 and 1995, he served as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Parliament.\nIn January 1995, he was nominated Minister of Foreign Affairs of Slovenia in the government of Janez Drnov\u0161ek, after Lojze Peterle of the Slovene Christian Democrats had resigned. Thaler's term in office was marked by tensions with neighbouring Italy, which had already begun in the previous years. The disagreements between the two countries were mostly centered around the issue of property restitution to Italian refugees from Yugoslavia from the late 1940s. Thaler was involved in several negotiations with the Italian Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli, in which he unblocked the Italian veto to Slovenia's access to the European Union. The Italian counterpart demanded that Slovenia changed its constitutional provisions which prevented foreign citizens to acquire real estates in Slovenia. In 1996, Slovenia agreed to the so-called \"Spanish compromise\", in which Slovenia promised to liberalize its property market regulations, allowing Italian and other EU citizens to purchase real estate in Slovenia. This resulted in the unblock of the Italian veto to Slovenia's access to the European Union. The deal made it possible for Slovenia to sign the Association Agreement with the EU on 10 June 1996 in Luxembourg and formally apply for membership in the EU the same day.\nIn May 1996, Thaler was impeached by the Parliament. In the final impeachment vote, a part of the ruling coalition (MPs from the Slovene Christian Democrats) joined the two major opposition forces (the Slovenian People's Party and the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia).In December 1996, Thaler was re-elected to Parliament on the list of the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia. In 1997 he became again Minister of Foreign Affairs in Janez Drnov\u0161ek's third cabinet. During his mandate, the Parliament ratified the Association Agreement with the EU, after having changed the Constitution a day earlier in accordance with the Spanish compromise. The European Commission gave a positive opinion on the Slovenian application for membership shortly afterwards. After that achievement Thaler left politics for business. Between 2004 and 2006, he served as chairman of Si.mobil, Slovenia's second largest mobile operator.\nIn 2009, he headed the list of the Social Democrats for the European Parliament, not being a member of the party and was elected on 7 June 2009. As a member of the European Parliament, Thaler was EP Rapporteur for Macedonia, vice-chairman of the EP Delegation for the South Caucasus, and a member of EP Foreign Affairs Committee.\nIn March 2011, The Sunday Times implicated Thaler among other members of the European Parliament in a cash-for-laws scandal. Rupert Murdoch's Sunday Times also provided edited video of Thaler discussing adding amendments to EU laws with undercover journalists.On 21 March he resigned as a member of the European Parliament. European Anti-fraud Office \u2013 OLAF investigated the case. In January 2012 OLAF concluded the investigation with the decision that there was \"no infringement\" on Thaler's side.\n\n\n== References =="

The whole of traditional price theory is covered in one chapter \u2026 [some] prices are formed by conventional mark-ups on prime costs, the level of the mark-up itself being left unexplained. Apart from this chapter, the book is doggedly macro-economic in treatment \u2026 A striking omission from the book is any mention of the closely related concepts of externalities and public goods, which most economists would nowadays regard as the basic ingredients of \u201cmarket failure\u201d that has come to be fruitfully applied \u2026 to problems of pollution and congestion.\u2019 (Blaug, 1974, pp. 71-2)\n\u2018Nothing is more difficult than to turn and entire discipline around, asking itself to jettison its own history over the last 200 years.\u2019 Blaug (1990, p. 205).\n\u2018Despite entries on socialism, socialist economics and market socialism, and biographical entries on Oskar Lange and Ludwig von Mises, the Socialist Calculation Debate, so crucial in the revival of general equilibrium theory and the rise of modern welfare economics in the 1930s, is nowhere discussed at length in The New Palgrave.\u2019 Blaug (1990, p. 236). \n\u2018The history of economic thought is irrepressible. It would survive even if it were banned \u2026 it would be carried on in secret in underground organizations. Many economists denigrate the history of economics as mere antiquarianism but, in fact, they have deluded ideas about the history of their own subject. After all, whenever anyone has a new idea in economics, whenever anyone hankers to start a new movement or school of thought, what is the first thing he or she does? Why, it is to rummage the attic of past ideas to establish an appropriate pedigree for the new departure. \u2026 Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Marshall and Keynes all drew on the history of economics to show that they had predecessors and forerunners; even Milton Friedman, when he launched the monetarist counterrevolution against Keynes, could not resist the temptation to quote David Hume over and again. The history of economic thought cannot be abolished and, were its study declared illegal, it would be studied in basements behind locked doors.\u2019 (\u2018Introduction\u2019, to Blaug, M. (ed.) (1991) The Historiography of Economics (Aldershot: Edward Elgar), p. x.)\n\u2018Modern Austrian economists go so far as to suggest that the Walrasian approach to the problem of multimarket equilibrium is a cul de sac: if we want to understand the process of competition, rather than the equilibrium end-state achieved by competition, we must begin by discarding such static reasoning as is implied by Walrasian GE theory. I have come slowly and extremely reluctantly to the view that they are right and that we have all been wrong\u2019 Mark Blaug (1991, pg. 508)\n\u2018The Lange idea of managers following marginal cost-pricing rules because they are instructed to do so, while the central planning board continually alters the prices of both producer and consumer goods so as to reduce their excess demands to zero, is so administratively naive as to be positively laughable. Only those drunk on perfectly competitive, static equilibrium theory could have swallowed such nonsense. ... in all the recent calls for reform of Soviet bloc economies, no one has ever suggested that Lange was of any relevance whatsoever. And still more ironically, Lange\u2019s \u201cmarket socialism\u201d is, on its own grounds, socialism without anything that can be called market transactions.\u2019 Mark Blaug (1993) Review of David R. Steele From Marx to Mises, in Economic Journal, 103(6), November, p. 1571. \n\u2018Modern economics is \u201csick\u201d. Economics has increasingly become an intellectual game played for its own sake and not for its practical consequences. Economists have gradually converted the subject into a sort of social mathematics in which analytical rigor as understood in math departments is everything and empirical relevance (as understood in physics departments) is nothing. If a topic cannot be tackled by formal modelling, it is simply consigned to the intellectual underworld. To pick up a copy of American Economic Review or Economic Journal, not to mention Econometrica or Review of Economic Studies these days is to wonder whether one has landed on a strange planet in which tedium is the deliberate objective of professional publication. Economics was condemned a century ago as \u201cthe dismal science\u201d, but the dismal science of yesterday was a lot less dismal than the soporific scholasticism of today.\u2019 Blaug (1998, p. 12)"

After theatrical distribution alongside Dazed and Confused, Super Grass was broadcast on Channel 4. Numerous other short films and commercials followed before he began directing mainstream television.His other works include two episodes of the ITV comedy drama Cold Feet in 1999, one of which featured the first location filming for the show outside England; due to last minute script changes, Vaughan led a small production team and two actors on half a day's filming in Paris, France. In 2003, he directed Deborah Moggach's two-part drama Final Demand for BBC One. The next year, he directed the BBC adaptation of He Knew He Was Right. Vaughan credits his work on the BBC dramas with sharpening his skills as a director, as the tight schedules meant he had to plan ahead.In 2006, he directed the Playtone/BBC Films feature film Starter for 10, and in 2008 the Regency Enterprises feature film What Happens in Vegas. Starter for 10 got him the job directing the CBS Films feature Extraordinary Measures, starring Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford. It was released in the United States in January 2010. Vaughan was pleased to be able to work with Ford, as Star Wars had inspired him to make his first amateur films.In 2011, Vaughan directed the Miley Cyrus feature So Undercover and is scheduled to direct the romantic comedy Boomsday. A screenplay version of Karen Bishko's musical Single is being developed with Vaughan attached to direct."

Dagelet's astronomical sightings gave precision to the maps posthumously published in the official Atlas du Voyage de la Perouse (Paris: L'Imprimerie de la Republique, An V, 1797).\nYoung Dagelet arrived in Paris in 1767, welcomed by his uncles the renowned clockmakers Jean-Andr\u00e9 and Jean-Baptiste Lepaute, who held the brevet horlogers du Roi. Through his aunt, Nicole-Reine Lepaute, wife of Jean-Andr\u00e9, he discovered his aptitude for astronomy. From his arrival until 1772 he studied in the observatory of the Coll\u00e8ge Mazarin, where he was guided by Joseph J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lefran\u00e7ois de Lalande.\nIn 1773 he departed for the South Seas with the expedition of Yves Joseph de Kerguelen de Tr\u00e9marec; on his return he was made professor of mathematics at the \u00c9cole Militaire, Paris.\nDagelet is known particularly for having calculated the distance between the center of Mercury and the Sun and for his map of the solar eclipse of 1778. Dagelet discovered WY Sagittae, a nova in Sagitta (27-29 July 1783) and was a scientific observer of the balloon ascent of Jacques Alexandre C\u00e9sar Charles from the Champ de Mars, Paris, 27 August 1783.\nHe presented his observations of the planets and stars to the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences and was received as adjoint and then named astronomer to the Academy in 1785, the year he embarked at Brest on the fatal expedition.\nAfter extensively mapping and recording the coastlines of North America, Japan, Korea and Siberia, Lap\u00e9rouse was directed by the French government to go to Botany Bay to observe the founding of the British Colony by the First Fleet. On 26 January 1788 Lap\u00e9rouse arrived at Botany Bay, just as the British were leaving for Port Jackson. The French ships stayed at Botany Bay for six weeks and built a stockade, observatory and a garden for fresh produce on the La Perouse peninsula. At Botany Bay Dagelet undertook calculations on map position of Botany Bay, carried out astronomical observations and met with William Dawes at Port Jackson. Dawes volunteered for service with the First Fleet and sailed on the Sirius. From February 1788, he was employed on shore to build an observatory at Dawes Point. Following this meeting Dagelet sent a letter to Dawes (1762-1836) with advice to Dawes on setting up his observatory, recent work on the fluctuations of the Earth's magnetic field and calculations on maps positions of Botany Bay.The island of Dagelet, named in his honour, is now known by its Korean name, Ulleungdo. In Alaska, Mount Dagelet still bears his name.\n\n\n== Notes =="

She was born into a very wealthy and prominent family in her state and city: her great-grandfather, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the last surviving signers and a delegate to the Second Continental Congress and later in the new Congress of the United States, her father was the Governor of Maryland from 1830\u20131831, and her mother was the daughter of a Baltimore physician. She was also the eldest of eight children.\nThe eldest of eight children, Anna was educated and trained by her father to be his aide. She was likely tutored in the law by him.

        "content": "Carroll entered the national political arena in the 1850s, following her father's appointment as Naval Officer for the District of Baltimore by Whig President Zachary Taylor. Shortly thereafter, Taylor died and Carroll's commission was signed by Millard Fillmore. In 1854, Carroll joined the American Party (the Know Nothing Party) following the demise of the Whigs. At the time much political realignment was going on nationwide. The same year the Republican Party was formed. The Southern pro-slavery Democrats took over control of their party's leadership in Congress due to the defeat of many Northern Democrats following the passage of the unpopular Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in May.\nIn Maryland, large numbers of immigrants, largely Irish and German Catholics, had flooded into Baltimore during the Great Famine in Ireland and the 1848 Revolutions in Germany. They took work in the port and railroad yards. Due to this rapid increase in population density, there was competition with free people of color for housing and jobs; street crime became a problem and relief rolls rose. At the same time, planters were a strong force in the state; many Catholic and Episcopalian planters resided on the Eastern Shore, which continued as primarily agricultural. In 1853, the Maryland Know Nothing party was formed, initially from three nativist groups. Yet beginning in February, it took in large numbers of striking laborers from the ironwork's factory in Baltimore, whom the Democratic Party had refused to support. In opposing the pro-slavery Democrats, the Know Nothings became a powerful, but divisive, party in the state. They were pro-Union, pro-labor, anti-Catholic, and anti-immigrant.\nAlong with other reformers, Anna Carroll campaigned by writing against urban machine corruption, crime, and what was perceived as the political threat of the power of the Catholic Church. In Maryland the Catholic planter/urban vote could combine to establish a pro-slavery state government. In 1856, the Whig Party split nationally into Northern and Southern factions due to the slavery issue. During the 1856 presidential election, Carroll supported and campaigned on behalf of Fillmore, the Know Nothing candidate. Carroll wrote many articles and pamphlets and she toured the Northeast on his behalf. Considered a moderate, Fillmore carried the state of Maryland, his only victory in the election.\nFor the 1856 campaign, Anna Carroll published two party books that greatly extended her political and press contacts: The Great American Battle, or, The Contest Between Christianity and Political Roman-ism and The Star of the West, and influential pamphlets such as \"The Union of the States\". The former book was a virulent criticism of the political influence of the Roman Catholic Church under the papacy of Pius IX  (see anti-clericalism). In 1857 Carroll was the chief publicist for Governor Thomas H. Hicks of Maryland; he credited his victory to her writings. In 1858, she took up the cause of former Congressman John Minor Botts, a Unionist from Virginia, in his presidential bid. She published a series of articles in the New York Evening Express newspaper on the 1860 candidates under the pseudonym \"Hancock.\" Others over time appeared in the influential National Intelligencer, among other venues."

        "content": "With the election of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860, Carroll freed her slaves. She began to work to oppose the secession of the Southern states and helped keep Maryland loyal to the Union. Lincoln's election set off the secession movement, which began with South Carolina's exit on December 20, 1860. The first six states to secede were those that held the largest number of slaves. In February 1861, the Confederate government was formed in Montgomery, Alabama. During this time Carroll was advising Governor Thomas H. Hicks on compromise efforts in the Congress. After Virginia seceded, she sent him intelligence on Confederate plans that might have resulted in a coup d'\u00e9tat of Washington, D.C., had  Maryland  seceded.During the summer of 1861, Carroll wrote a political pamphlet in response to a speech given on the floor of the senate by the Hon. John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. He had argued that Lincoln had acted in violation of the Constitution by mustering state militias into service following the bombardment of Fort Sumter, suspending the writ of habeas corpus, and imposing martial law and a naval blockade. In her reply pamphlet, which was widely circulated by the Lincoln administration, Carroll made informed legal arguments, later used by Attorney General Edward Bates, stating that Lincoln had acted in accordance with the Constitution.  She noted that, as the chief enforcement officer of the nation, Lincoln could use all his powers to enforce federal law in the Southern states.  Those powers included his role as commander-in-chief of the armed forces.  Under an agreement made with the government, by 1862 Carroll had produced three more war powers pamphlets that presented able constitutional arguments supporting the federal government's actions. Governor Hicks wrote that her documents did more to elect a Union man as his successor than \"all the rest of the campaign documents together.\""

        "content": "In the fall of 1861, Carroll traveled to St. Louis to work with secret agent, Judge Lemuel Dale Evans, who had been appointed by Secretary of State William H. Seward to assess the feasibility of a Union invasion of Texas. Carroll worked on her second war powers paper at the Mercantile Library. She also gathered information from the head librarian, who was the brother of Confederate General Joe Johnston. She took military matters into her own hands when she initiated an interview with a riverboat pilot, Capt. Charles M. Scott, about the feasibility of the planned Union Mississippi River expedition. Scott told her that he and other pilots thought the advance ill-conceived because there were many defensible points on the Mississippi River that could be reinforced. It could take years just to open up the river to navigation by trying to broach those points. Carroll questioned Scott about the feasibility of using the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers for a Union invasion of the South. Scott provided Carroll with technical navigation details. Based on this information, Carroll wrote a memorandum to Assistant Secretary of War Thomas A. Scott and Attorney General Edward Bates in late November 1861, advocating that the combined army-navy forces change their invasion route from the Mississippi to the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers.\nMeanwhile, in St. Louis, Major General Henry W. Halleck was planning the same movement without Lincoln's knowledge. Upon learning that Confederates were possibly sending reinforcements west from Virginia, Halleck ordered Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant and Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote to immediately move on Fort Henry and Fort Donelson on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers in a telegram dated January 30. Scott was dispatched to the Midwest to mobilize reinforcements for Halleck on the night of January 29. On February 6, Fort Henry fell to Foote's gunboats and on February 13, Fort Donelson fell to Grant's and Foote's combined forces. These comprised the first two \"real victories\" of the Civil War for the Union, as Gen. William Sherman wrote later. At the time Carroll's role in the effort was kept secret. Immediately following the war, she gave credit for the plan to Capt. Charles Scott in a letter printed in a leading Washington newspaper. Years later, Assistant Secretary of War Scott and Senator Wade testified to her critical role before Congress.\nDuring the remainder of the war, Carroll worked with Lincoln on issues pertaining to emancipation and colonization of American slaves. She and Aaron Columbus Burr lobbied him to establish a colony of freedmen in British Honduras, today Belize. Although Carroll had freed her own slaves, she lobbied Lincoln against issuing the Emancipation Proclamation. She feared that this action would cost the support of Southern Unionists and resistance to the Union would be stiffened. But, she wrote that Lincoln did have the constitutional right to free the slaves as a temporary war measure under his power as commander-in-chief, since the proclamation would help cripple the organized forces of the rebellion. Yet the measure was not a transfer of title and would have to be suspended once the war emergency ended. To free the slaves required a constitutional amendment."

        "content": "In the postwar years, Carroll traveled with Lemuel Evans to report on his role in the Texas constitutional convention to draw up a new state constitution.  She was active in the Republican Party in Maryland and continued her political writing career. After 1870, however, she had to devote much time to trying to gain payment for $5,000 (~$120,474 in 2023) which she insisted that the government still owed her for her wartime publications. She went through twenty years of congressional hearings. Every military committee but one voted in her favor, but no bills passed the Congress. She filed a claim in the United States Court of Claims in 1885, but was denied. Justice J. Nott wrote that the documents she used to back up her claim were \"impressive\" but \"valueless as blank paper\" because \"they establish no judicial fact.\" Despite the rulings against her claim\u2014or, more likely, because of those negative rulings\u2014Carroll received support from women's and suffrage organizations. The suffragists commissioned a biography of her in 1891 by Sarah Ellen Blackwell.\nAnna Ella Carroll died of Bright's disease, a kidney ailment, on February 19, 1894, at the age of 79.  She is buried at Old Trinity Church, near Church Creek, Maryland, beside her parents and other members of her family. The epitaph on her grave reads, \"A woman rarely gifted; an able and accomplished writer.\"In 1959, the state historical society unveiled a monument to Carroll with the words, \"Maryland's Most Distinguished Lady. A great humanitarian and close friend of Abraham Lincoln. She conceived the successful Tennessee Campaign and guided the President on his constitutional war powers.\"  The gravestone was inscribed with 1893 as the year of her death, but a Washington, D.C., death certificate lists the correct death year of 1894. Surviving letters in her writing exist from that year before her death."

        "content": "Well into the 20th century, Carroll was hailed as a feminist heroine whose contributions were denied because of her sex. Some scholars, however, have attempted to discredit her tale, arguing that she was more a \"relentless self-promoter\" than the \"woman who saved the Union,\" as novelists, playwrights, and suffragists called her. Carroll had condemned the Emancipation Proclamation and recommended colonization of blacks. Yet research published in 2004 unveiled new sources, primarily Maryland political histories and Lincoln administration records, that analyze the Maryland Know Nothing party in a new progressive light. These materials generally support (but slightly diminish) Carroll's role in the Tennessee River campaign.  A plan nearly identical to Carroll's was printed in the New York Times two weeks prior to the date Carroll said she sent her plan to the War Department in Washington; a similar version was printed in late December. Original sources found in Carroll's papers, housed in the Maryland State Archives, remain problematic as source material. Many of them, purportedly from leading politicians of the time, are in her handwriting, a distinctive scrawl."

Called to the Neapolitan court by Queen Joan II of Anjou, he became a favourite of the powerful minister Sergianni Caracciolo.\nHe was the Feudal Lord of Anversa, Arce, Bari, Campo di Giove, Monteodorisio, Pacentro, Palena, Trivento, Valva and Vasto.\nJacopo was the son of Giovanni Antonio Caldora, and Rita Cantelmo, a noblewoman of the powerful Cantelmo Family of French origin. He had two brothers, Restaino and Raimondo.\n\nIn the political turmoil of the period, Caldora later became a general of Alfonso V of Aragon in his conquest of the Kingdom. When the Aragonese troops were left under siege in Naples, he changed sides again, winning the title of gran connestabile from Queen Joan, and serving as assistant to the Kingdom's commander-in-chief Muzio Attendolo Sforza. When the latter drowned before the Battle of L'Aquila in 1424, Caldora led the Angevine army to victory.\nHe subsequently continued to defend the Anjou cause after Alfonso's return. In 1431 he was sent to fight against the excommunicated Colonna in southern Lazio, but he was bribed by them and remained inactive. When his protector Sergianni Caracciolo died, and the marriage of his daughter Maria to Francesco Sforza was annulled by Pope Martin V, he returned to his lands.\nHe died during a siege at Colle Sannita, near Benevento. He was buried by his family in a chapel of the Abbey of the Holy Spirit (also known as Badia Morronese), near Sulmona. This chapel and an elaborate sarcophagus was built by his mother for the family in 1412.\nHis son Antonio Caldora was also a successful condottiero who later sided with the Anjou faction against Ferdinand of Aragon.

        "content": "Glenn Toby, a fellow Queens rapper known as Mr Sweety G, produced Positive K's first solo record \"Getting Paid\" for the short-lived independent label Star Maker Records. The track brought him recognition after it was included on the label's showcase album Fast Money, a 1986 compilation featuring Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock's debut recording and a track by hip hop pioneer Disco Dave.In 1987, Positive K signed to Nat Robinson's First Priority Music under the management of Lumumba Carson (the son of activist Sonny Carson) who would later become better known as X-Clan founding member Professor X The Overseer. With the guidance and production skills of Grand Puba of Brand Nubian and Daddy-O of Stetsasonic, Positive K released a number of songs that appeared on various underground compilations. His 1989 duet with MC Lyte \"I'm Not Havin' It\" was Positive K's first song to land on a Billboard music chart and it helped further establish his reputation in hip hop. Positive K soon left First Priority Music, feeling there was favoritism happening with the owner's relatives on the label.After leaving First Priority Music, Positive K began working closely with Big Daddy Kane, whom he'd met through a mutual friend. He would bring Positive K on stage to freestyle with Jay-Z and Sauce Money. Guest spots on Brand Nubian\u2019s One for All and Grand Puba's Reel to Reel along with his self-released, Big Daddy Kane-produced single \"Nightshift\" generated enough interest to land him a major record label deal.\nThe Skills Dat Pay Da Bills, Positive K's 1992 full-length debut on Island Records, balanced themes of Nation of Gods and Earths with gangsta-isms and more pop-based moments. The album's most successful single was \"I Got a Man,\" a track loosely based on his earlier duet with MC Lyte \"I'm Not Havin' It.\" This time, however, he pitch-shifted his own vocals to perform the lines of the track's female rapper himself. \"I Got A Man\" reached #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1993. Meanwhile, he kept his Creative Control label in operation, signing and cultivating new talent.\nLater that year, Positive K was featured in a remix of the song \"Come To Butt-head\" with Beavis and Butt-head on the soundtrack album for the film The Beavis and Butt-head Experience. The song is hidden at the end of the album on the same track as \"I Got You Babe,\" performed by Beavis and Butt-head with Cher. The same year, Positive K briefly appeared in the Robert De Niro film A Bronx Tale as an angry protester and was featured on WYBE's Old School Show, where he was awarded the #3 slot on the list of early hip hop pioneers.\nAfter touring extensively to promote The Skills Dat Pay Da Bills, Positive K focused his efforts on other interests. Island Records had wanted him to record a full album with Grand Puba, but only one song, \"Back Together Again,\" was recorded and the track never saw release. Instead, he started a promotion company, handling record promotions for Def Jam Recordings and London Records, and booked acts in his Harlem studio. During this time, he also worked with Outkast, Rampage and Puff Daddy. Eventually he became fed up with the music business and took a short break from it.In late 1996, Positive K re-emerged and told Billboard Magazine that his sophomore album, due out in February 1997, would be named Straight To The Moon. He explained the album, like his debut, would be released on both his personal record label Creative Control as well as Island Records, and would feature guest appearances by Al Green and Harry Connick Jr. Its Teddy Riley-produced lead single \"Black Cinderella\" saw an independent label 1996 release on PosK Records but the full album never materialized.\nPositive K has continued to release music over the last 20+ years without duplicating his earlier success of \"I Got a Man,\" earning him the status of one hit wonder. In 2007, he appeared on Nas' track \"Where Are They Now ('90s Remix).\" In 2008, a compilation album Back to the Old School was released under the EchoVista label. In 2015, Positive K teamed with Greg Nice on his song \"Make It Happen\" which led to a pairing that would result in a full-length album in 2017, preceded by its lead single was \"Bring It.\" The pair refer to themselves individually as PK Dolla and N.I. and collectively as Gr8te Mindz, but the album is sold online under the artist name \"Positive K and Greg Nice.\"\nPositive K told Unkut in 2013 that his next solo effort would be titled Pos K In The Extreme, but it has yet to surface."

During the 1960s he began creating outline sketches for improvisation, and beginning in the 1970s became increasingly interested in environmental sound and the problem of noise pollution.\nIn 1966 he was a founder of the Groupe d'Etude et R\u00e9alisation Musicales (GERM), and in 1979 founded the Laboratoire Acoustique et Musique Urbaine de l'Ecole d'Architecture de Paris La Villette, which he directed until 1990. Mari\u00e9tan taught at the University of Paris (I et VIII) from 1969 to 1988 and at the Ecole d'Architecture de Paris la Villette in 1993. He was Director of the Conservatoire de Garges (R\u00e9gion parisienne) 1972\u201377, and has been a visiting lecturer at the Universities of Paris, Lille, Barcelona,Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, University of California San Diego, the Ecole Hautes Etudes Sociales Paris, Ecoles Nationales Sup\u00e9rieures des Beaux-Arts et d'Architecture of Paris, Besan\u00e7on, and Marseilles, and the \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Lausanne."

Since the 1970s he has mainly focussed on combining composed music (\"music of the interior\"), with everyday environmental sounds (\"music of the exterior\"), which has led him to electronic and radiophonic composition. Paysmusique (1991), for example, combines 96 voices speaking in different Swiss dialects. He has also created sound installations and sound environments, sometimes collaborating with architects."

When a fire accidentally broke out in the city on 16 March 1190, de Malbis used the opportunity to incite a mob to attack the home of Benedict of York, the recently deceased agent of Aaron of Lincoln, killing his widow and children and burning the house.\nThe following evening, (the day of the Jewish feast of Shabbat HaGadol, the shabbat before Passover), Josce of York (Joseph), the leader of the Jewish community of York, gained permission from the constable of York Castle to bring his wife and children, Rabbi Yom Tov and the rest of the Jews into the castle. The group, numbering about 150, then took refuge in the castle's motte that had a wooden tower, but the motte was besieged by the mob demanding that the Jews be baptized and convert to Christianity.\nWith no hope of escape, Rabbi Yom Tov advised the other Jews to kill themselves rather than convert. Josce began by slaying his wife Anna and two children. He was then killed by Yom Tov. The father of each family killed his wife and children and then Yom Tov stabbed the men before killing himself. The tower was set alight so their bodies could not be mutilated by the mob.\nA handful of Jews who did not kill themselves surrendered at daybreak on 17 March, leaving the castle on a promise that they would not be harmed, but they were all killed by the mob.\nThe pogrom was part of a series of massacres against other Jewish communities in England over the preceding weeks. It was in the wake of religious fervor created from preparations for the Third Crusade led by Richard I against the Saracens."

The Clinton band's repertoire was split between pop tunes of the day (\"I Double Dare You\", \"Summer Souvenirs\", \"Deep Purple\"), ambitious instrumentals penned by Clinton like \"Satan Takes a Holiday\" (recorded by Tommy Dorsey), \"The Big Dipper\", \"Midnight in the Madhouse\", and the most popular, \"A Study in Brown\", which begat four sequels in different \"colors\", and swing adaptations of classical compositions. This last category swept the industry, and orchestras everywhere were \"swinging the classics\" by adding pop lyrics to melodies by Debussy and Tchaikovsky. His arrangement and adaptation of Debussy's \"Reverie\", with vocalist Bea Wain, was particularly popular. Entitled \"My Reverie\", his version peaked at No. 1 on Billboard's Record Buying Guide in 1938. \"Abba Dabba\" was based on Tchaikovsky's Arabian Dance from The Nutcracker.\nHe was the first to record and release the standard \"Heart and Soul\" featuring Bea Wain on vocals in 1939. The single reached no. 1.\nTommy Dorsey and His Orchestra were the first to record and release his classic composition \"The Dipsy Doodle\" in 1937 featuring Edythe Wright on vocals.\nHis composition \"Calypso Melody\" was a chart hit for bandleader and composer David Rose in 1957 on M-G-M Records, becoming a million seller and earning a gold disc.

Two years later, when Lee became the chief executive of Taiwan Province, Huang followed Lee to the Taiwan Provincial Government and was appointed the Deputy Secretary-General. After returning to National Taiwan University in 1984 as a professor, he was appointed the Secretary-General of Taipei City Government in 1987. He became the acting Mayor of Taipei in May 1990, replacing Wu Poh-hsiung. In October, he was appointed Mayor of Taipei by President Lee Teng-hui. During the final year of Huang's term, under the pressure of democratization, the office of mayor became directly elected. Huang is the last Mayor of Taipei to have served via presidential appointment.\nIn the 1994 Taipei mayoral election, Huang received a late nomination from the Kuomintang. Though he secured the party's endorsement and support from Lee, Huang did not win the election. The loss could be partly ascribed to the split between the Kuomintang and Chinese New Party within the Pan-Blue Coalition. Although the entire Pan-Blue Coalition gained more votes, Huang only received 25.89% of the voter turnout, allowing Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian to be elected in a traditional pro-Chinese unification city and Mainlander stronghold.\nAfter he lost the mayoral election, Huang was appointed the Minister of the Research, Development, and Evaluation Commission in June 1996, and a Minister without Portfolio in 1997.\nHe was appointed National Policy Advisor by President Ma Ying-jeou in 2009."

        "content": "Henry was born on 8 April 1914 in Belgravia, London. She was descended from Prime Ministers John Russell (her great-great-grandfather) and Robert Peel, and was the cousin once removed of Bertrand Russell. She was raised by grandparents in Ireland after her parents separated. After returning to England and finishing her education, she made her society d\u00e9but in 1932. She had a twin sister, who died at the age of 21.In 1938 she married army officer Donald Standage; the couple had one daughter. The marriage broke down in the late 1940s and they were divorced by 1950. After getting into debt through gambling, Henry accepted a forged cheque from a friend as a loan. She was convicted at the Old Bailey in 1951 and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment; though the 'Daily Telegraph' 's obituary claims \"...she was na\u00efve enough not to realise that the cheque had been forged\". She served eight months, the majority at Holloway prison, and also at Askham Grange open prison.  At the latter, she came under the care of Anglo-Irish prison reformer Mary Size, who she later described in her 1952 book Who Lie in Gaol as \"a mixture of discipline and humanity.\""

She came to prominence in 1952 with the publication of Who Lie in Gaol (the title was taken from a line in Oscar Wilde's The Ballad of Reading Gaol), based on her experiences in prison, which became a best-seller. Henry was critical of Holloway prison, giving accounts of brutal treatment and neglect she had witnessed. The book was the basis for the film The Weak and the Wicked (1953), directed by J. Lee Thompson with Glynis Johns playing a character based on Henry.Yield to the Night (the title was taken from Book VII of the Iliad), a novel following a woman awaiting execution, was published in 1954. A film version was released in 1956 with Diana Dors in the lead role. Henry co-wrote the script, which was nominated for a BAFTA award for Best British Screenplay. The film was again directed by Lee Thompson, whom Henry married in 1958.In 1960 Henry's play Look on Tempests was staged at the Comedy Theatre in London's West End. It continued Henry's focus on the justice system, depicting the effect on the upper middle class family of a man accused of gross indecency, and became the first play dealing with homosexuality to be approved for performance by the Lord Chamberlain, who had lifted a ban on the subject the previous year.Henry also wrote two television plays, Rough Justice in 1962 and Person to Person in 1967. She and Lee Thompson divorced in the late 1960s."

In Santiago he held positions as a senator and a professor, as well as directing several local newspapers. As a legislator, he was the main promoter and editor of the Chilean Civil Code, one of the most innovative and influential American legal works of his time. In 1842, under his inspiration and with his decisive support,  the University of Chile was created, an institution of which he became the first rector, staying in the post for more than two decades. Due to his great contributions, on 17 October 1832 he was given Chilean nationality through a law approved by the Congress."

He had been hired by his brother-in-law, Louis Skidmore, the chief architect for the exposition. Together they designed the layout and buildings for the entire site. They were told to build pavilions for more than 500 exhibits at minimum cost using lightweight, mass-produced materials; and they devised solutions, using the simplest materials\u2014pavilions built out of beaverboard.After the exposition was over, the two men worked independently before forming a Chicago-based partnership in 1936 with a small office at 104 South Michigan Avenue. Some smaller projects remain from this period. An architecturally significant residence in Northfield, Illinois, still looks and feels contemporary because of its open, inviting interiors and large windows. The partnership developed projects for corporate clients they had met during the Chicago exposition.\nThe firm opened a second office at 5 East 57th Street in New York in 1937; and young Gordon Bunshaft was hired by Skidmore.

After graduation, he was sent to work at Siderurgica Hunedoara, a steel foundry. In 1989, the ruling Romanian Communist Party (PCR) sent him to the Timi\u0219oara party school; after finishing second in his class that October, he was named secretary for economic affairs in Hunedoara. During that December's revolution, the insurgents who entered his office were surprised to find only stacks of paper inside, instead of luxury goods, and a number of individuals anonymously stated that he was the only PCR activist to help them out during those days. However, factory employees recalled he was on the premises at the time, urging employees to \"stop this nonsense about a Revolution\". Following the revolution, he continued working at the foundry, remaining until 1991 as a section chief, which he had been since 1981; then from 1992 to 1993 as adviser to the director; and afterwards as chief of technical services. From 1997 to 2001, when he was replaced, Pogea directed the foundry, where he acquired a reputation for insisting on total control, and where he conducted a restructuring that saw several thousand people leave the firm. He has also directed two Simeria marble producers: Marmosim from 2001 to 2004 and Titan Mar from 2006 to 2008; both of these are largely owned by Adriean Videanu.In October 2000, Pogea entered the Democratic Party (PD; later evolved into the PD-L), the first party he entered after 1989. He ran for a Senate seat in the election the following month, but barely lost. In 2000, he was elected head of the Hunedoara chapter of the PD; soon after, he won the chairmanship of the Hunedoara County chapter, heading it from 2000 to 2006. He was also county councillor there for several months. In 2004, he co-authored the electoral manifesto of the Justice and Truth Alliance, which won the November elections. He was also strategy coordinator for the new PDL, and co-authored its programme for the 2008 election. Between 2005 and 2006, he served in the T\u0103riceanu cabinet, until being compelled to resign by party leader Boc and President Traian B\u0103sescu, partly as a means of putting pressure on T\u0103riceanu's PNL. He was then offered the position of Bucharest city manager, but declined, returning instead to the marble business. He became Finance Minister when the Boc executive came into office following the 2008 election. The beginning of his term coincided with the onset of a financial crisis in Romania, leading him to vow a rewrite of the state budget with up to 15% cuts in salaries for government employees, and to warn that Romania's GDP could fall by 6.5% in 2009. He also promised a complete rewrite of the fiscal code, aiming to make it simpler and more transparent, and reduce the number of taxes on businesses and individuals. In October 2009, he became interim Labour Minister following the resignation of his PSD cabinet colleagues, including Marian S\u00e2rbu, the previous occupant of that ministry, holding the portfolio until December. His ministerial term ended when he was not reappointed to a new cabinet under Boc at the end of 2009. In August 2013, he was named director of CrisTim, a producer of cold meats.\n\n\n== Notes =="

And within today's thriving Texas and Red Dirt scene, he's a revered elder statesman to countless performers and songwriters who teethed and grew up on his music. \"They\u2019ve let me know I inspired them and showed them how it could be done.\" Nunn moved back to the Austin area in 2003.Nunn's songs have been recorded by various nationally known country artists, including Jerry Jeff Walker, Michael Murphey, Tracy Nelson, David Allan Coe, Rosanne Cash, and Willie Nelson among others. With a continuing array of successful solo albums and an army of fans, Nunn has made a permanent mark on the Texas/Southwestern/Country/Folk music scene.\nAlong with being a touring performer, Nunn has appeared on programs such as Nashville Now, The Nashville Network's Texas Connection, music videos and special appearances on TNN, Austin City Limits, Texas Rangers baseball games (singing the national anthem), among other appearances."

His legacy is celebrated in the South Orange-Maplewood School District.Ricalton was locally famous for his habit of conducting classes outdoors in good weather and for his gentle manner. Among other things, a central square in Maplewood village is named after him, and there is a large mural of his outdoor classes in Maplewood municipal hall.He expanded his house on Valley Street in Maplewood to house his enormous collection.

Every summer, while on vacation from his school, he embarked on journeys overseas using a wheelbarrow-like cart large enough to transport his photography equipment by day, and to sleep in by night. It was designed such that during rainy weather Ricalton could stand in a well in the middle and continue walking under the cart's cover. Using this system, he visited Iceland, the Amazon and the St. Petersburg region of Russia, bringing back thousands of photographs, mineral specimens, and curios. His voyages came to the attention of local inventor Thomas A. Edison, who financed an expedition to search the Far East for a bamboo filament suitable for use in the incandescent lamp. Ricalton took a one-year leave of absence from teaching, and departed the United States in February 1888, arriving in Ceylon on April 1, via the Suez Canal.\nRicalton visited every part of the island, testing hundreds of samples, and continuing on to  British India, Singapore, China and Japan, becoming an expert in the properties of various types of bamboo. He returned home one year after his departure, with hundreds of samples for Edison, and recommendations on the two most suitable. This filament was used by Edison for nine months until the suitability of tungsten was discovered."

When Ricalton tried to take pictures of Japanese soldiers in trenches during the Port Arthur campaign, he was held in custody until Major Yamaoka of General Nogi's staff confirmed that the American photographer could take pictures of whatever he wanted.\nHe was amongst the  photographers who recorded the 1903 Delhi Durbar which celebrated the installation of Edward VII as Emperor of India.Ricalton's photographs earned him numerous honors and many were used to illustrate textbooks. He sold his images to the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.  Many of his photographs were used by the Underwood & Underwood to illustrate geography books.In 1909, at age 65, he walked from Cape Town to Cairo, a distance of 4,500 miles averaging 30 miles a day.  An extant diary confirms his daily itinerary through South Africa, Rhodesia, and Kenya.In 1912, Ricalton was sent on another assignment by Edison to test a motion picture camera in Africa, filming among other things a whaling expedition off Cape Town. His son Lomond accompanied him on this trip but died from typhoid fever there, and this was Ricalton's last trip.Ricalton retired to his home town of Waddington, New York, where he died October 28, 1929, at the age of 85."

Gruppe (2nd group) of Schlachtgeschwader 1 (SG 1\u20141st Ground Assault Wing). As an Oberfeldwebel, he flew his first combat mission on southern sector of the Eastern Front and claimed his first aerial victory on 23 April 1943 was not confirmed. Lambert flew almost 200 ground support missions in which he and the fellow pilots of II./SG 2 accounted for the destruction of hundreds of ground support vehicles and artillery batteries.\nII./SG 1 was renamed Schlachtgeschwader 2 \"Immelmann\" (SG 2\u20142nd Ground Assault Wing) on 18 October 1943.\nII. Gruppe of SG 2 was heavily involved in the Crimean campaign during early-mid 1944, and in addition to its usual ground-attack work flew interception sorties, claiming some 247 Soviet aircraft shot down. On 10 April 1944, he claimed four victories, a Yak-9, a P-39 Airacobra and two Il-2 Sturmoviks. On 17 April 1944, Lambert was credited with twelve aerial victories, including five Il-2 Sturmovik. According to Bergstr\u00f6m, this number may be exaggerated according to Soviet records. The Ministry of Aviation (RLM\u2014Reichsluftfahrtministerium) only holds records for five of these claims. He claimed nine further victories on 4 May. On 6 May 1944, Lambert again claimed to have become a \"double-ace in a day\". These 14 aerial victories over an unknown type were not documented by the RLM.Leutnant Lambert claimed some 70 aerial victories during one three-week period. He received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) on 14 May 1944 and the German Cross in Gold (Deutsches Kreuz in Gold) on 1 October 1944. By May 1944, the depleted II./SG 2 retired to bases in Romania.\nFollowing the Battle of the Crimea resulting in the evacuation of the Crimea by the Germans, Lambert served as an instructor with Schlachtgeschwader 151. In March 1945, he was posted to Schlachtgeschwader 77 (SG 77\u201477th Ground Assault Wing) where he commanded 8. Staffel as Staffelkapit\u00e4n (squadron leader) and Oberleutnant. In April 1945, Lambert was credited with his 100th aerial victory. He was the 101st Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark.On the morning of 17 April 1945, Leutnant Gerhard Bauer, Lambert, and another pilot were taking off from Kamenz for a mission to the front when American P-51Ds of the 55th Fighter Group appeared. Bauer's Fw 190 F-9 \"Black 1 +\" was quickly shot down north of Kuckau, about eight kilometres east-south-east of Kamenz. August Lambert and another 8./Schlachtgeschwader 77 pilot tried desperately to get away, but could not lose their pursuers. Lambert was shot down and killed in action in his Fw 190 F-8 \"Black 9 +\" just north of Hoyerswerda, a town some 20 kilometres (12 mi) north-north-east of Kamenz.Lambert was officially credited with shooting down 116 enemy aircraft, all claimed on the Eastern Front. He also claimed over 100 vehicles destroyed in ground attacks. After his death, Lambert had been nominated for the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross, but this request was not approved."

John Bateson (1898\u20131918), the eldest of the three, was killed in World War I. Martin Bateson (1900\u20131922), the second brother, was then expected to follow in his father's footsteps as a scientist, but came into conflict with his father over his ambition to become a poet and playwright. The resulting stress, combined with a disappointment in love, resulted in Martin's public suicide by gunshot under the statue of Anteros in Piccadilly Circus on 22 April 1922, which was John's birthday. After this event, which transformed a private family tragedy into a public scandal, the parents' ambitious expectations fell on Gregory."

He was stationed in the same offices as Julia Child (then Julia McWilliams), Paul Cushing Child, and others. He spent much of the war designing 'black propaganda' radio broadcasts. He was deployed on covert operations in Burma and Thailand, and worked in China, India, and Ceylon as well. Bateson used his theory of schismogenesis to help foster discord among enemy fighters. He was upset by his wartime experience and disagreed with his wife over whether science should be applied to social planning or used only to foster understanding rather than action.In Palo Alto, California, Bateson developed the double-bind theory, together with his non-colleagues Donald Jackson, Jay Haley and John H.

Vallier's father was Jean Vallier, a distinguished operatic Bass.\nVallier was immersed from his first years in the purest traditions of piano playing embellished with authenticity of interpretation.\nVallier gave his first solo concert at the age of eight, and was something of a child prodigy giving recitals in the South of France.  He was heard by Moritz Rosenthal (Liszt's pupil) whom he much impressed.  However his Aunt wisely held back developing the young talent too early.

He was demobilised with the rank of captain.\nHe resumed his performing career and concertized extensively.   There were some notable recitals in London and the UK and some in Europe.

He was one of the last who would improvise the cadenza to a concerto, particularly Beethoven, and, as an encore, would invite the name of a composer and tune from the audience and then improvise a piece in the style of the composer suggested.  He also undertook valuable educational work in bringing classical music to children in parts of the country where live performances were rare in the 1940s and early 1950s at schools for the WEA.

Internationally, his fame arises chiefly from his extensive body of choral music, which exceeds 500 individual choral songs, most of it a cappella. The great majority of these pieces are based on traditional ancient Estonian folksongs (regilaulud), either textually, melodically, or merely stylistically.\nHis composition most often performed outside Estonia, Curse Upon Iron (Raua needmine) (1972), invokes ancient Shamanistic traditions to construct an allegory about the evils of war. Some of his works were banned by the Soviet government, but because folk music was fundamental to his style most of his compositions were accepted by the censors.\nMore recently, Tormis' works have been performed and recorded by T\u00f5nu Kaljuste with the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir, and others. In the 1990s, Tormis began to receive commissions from some a cappella groups as the King's Singers and the Hilliard Ensemble.\nTormis famously said of his settings of traditional melodies and verse: \"It is not I who makes use of folk music, it is folk music that makes use of me.\" His work demonstrates his conviction that traditional Estonian and other Balto-Finnic music represents a treasure which must be guarded and nourished, and that culture may be kept alive through the medium of song."

His delight in the contrasting timbres provided by the organ stops may also be connected to his later orchestration of choral textures, a hallmark of his mature style.Tormis began his formal musical education in 1943 at the Tallinn Music School, but was interrupted by World War II and illness. In 1949, he entered the Tallinn Conservatory and continued his studies at the Moscow Conservatory (1951\u20131956). He quickly acquired teaching positions at the Tallinn Music School (1955\u201360) and the Tallinn Music High School (1962\u201366), but by 1969 was supporting himself exclusively as a freelance composer. One of his pupils was composer Kuldar Sink.\nFrom his student days until his retirement from composition in 2000, Tormis composed over 500 individual choral songs, as well as other vocal and instrumental pieces, 35 film scores, and an opera. Despite the censorship of several of his more politically provocative works in the late 1970s and the 1980s, he remained an incredibly celebrated composer whose works were performed throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. In Eastern Europe, he is regarded as one of the great contributors to the 20th century repertory of choral music. Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 has allowed increased access to the Soviet censored compositional output. The music of Tormis, along with other composers in the region, is experiencing increased rates of programing and publishing, allowing for increased appreciation of the choral and vocal music traditions."

Langu took part in the great Assembly of Dibra on February 27, 1899. After graduating from the madrasa, he continued his high school education in Bitola and in 1904 went to study theology in Istanbul. In December 1908, he formed the \"Bashkimi\" club of Debar. As leader of the club's administrative council, along with other activists such as Kadri Fishta, Riza Rusi, Eqerem Cami, Ibrahim Xhidri, Abdullah T\u00ebrshana and Ibrahim Jegeni, he carried out vigorous activities for the benefit of the national cause.\nHis grandfather Selim Rusi, supported him in continuing his studies in Bitola and later in Istanbul, where he met other figures of the Albanian National Awakening, including Ibrahim Temo and Dervish Hima. He moved from Bitola to Debar in 1907, and formed a chapter of the Society for the Unity of the Albanian Language there in December 1908. The chapter also included Fishta, Riza Rusi, Eqerem Cami, Ibrahim Xhidri, Ramadan Camin, Abdullah T\u00ebrshana, and Ibrahim Jegeni. Langu also helped organize the Congress of Dibra on July 23, 1909. At the end of June 1910, Shevket Turgut Pasha, who derided Langu as a \u201cLatin priest,\u201d crushed the rebellion, but it continued underground.\nLangu continued to lobby for Albanian-language schooling in the area, and the people of Debar elected him unanimously as their first official teacher of same. Carefully watching the fall of the Ottoman Empire, he joined Cami, Ismail Strazimiri, Tajar Tetova, Ramadan Cami, and Sulejman Shehu from Zerqan in taking up arms to liberate Debar. By now the leading local independence ideologue, he was elected along with Vehbi Dibra to the Assembly of Vlor\u00eb. He left Vlor\u00eb to organize resistance to the Serbian occupation of the Debar and Elbasan regions. He was arrested but freed by public agitation.\nHe was ushered into Elbasan by his longtime friend Aqif Pasha Elbasani and helped connect the tribes near Debar with the Provisional Government of Albania out of Vlor\u00eb. A commission consisting of Langu, Elbasani, Tetova, Ismail Haki Peqini, and Ahmet Dakli, set out to professionalize local government in Debar. They were helped by Ramadan Cami, Hoxh\u00eb Muglica, Hoxh\u00eb Kurt Ball\u00eb, and others in this effort. From 1913 to 1917, Langu acted as qadi (sharia judge) in the parts of the Dib\u00ebr valley under Albanian rule. He then resettled in Debar, serving as an imam and occasional qadi there from 1920 to 1938. Reconnecting with local associates, he was surveilled by the Yugoslav government. From April 1938 to 1941, he served as chairman of the Skopje Council of Ulema, but seeing growing danger, he left for Tirana to serve as leader of the Muslim Community of Albania, promoting interreligious tolerance as the key to national unity.\nIn 1947, at the age of 70, he was sentenced to ten years in prison for agitation and propaganda. He was released in 1950 and died in 1956.\n\n\n== References =="

He soon began drawing his own manga in 1933 and came to fame after World War II with a series of comedic manga for children based on stories like those of Sasuke Sarutobi, Jiraiya, and Journey to the West. Sugiura closely followed popular culture and thus his manga were also influenced by such contemporary fads as Godzilla, pro wrestling, and American science fiction films. The philosophy of his manga \"is of yukai, pleasure and amusement, pursuing the path as far from seriousness as possible. . . . The praxis of yukai is essentially the body in free motion, and Sugiura\u2019s characters are defined by an excess of movement.\" The result was a visual style that was often surreal and absurd. A craftsman, Sugiura could not keep up with the mass production of manga that the shift to weekly magazines brought at the end of the 1950s, and his subsequent manga became more and more surreal, if not avant-garde, as they came to be directed at an older audience. He enjoyed a second boom in popularity from the 1970s on."

In 1525 he was an ambassador in his own right to Pope Clement VII, when the Grand Duke Vasily III desired to join the anti-Ottoman League. During his stay in Rome, Dmitri related details to Giovio of the geography of Russia and the northern countries. This information was compiled by Giovio into a separate book, and subsequently mapped by Battista Agnese in Venice and was a pattern for most 16th-century maps of Muscovy.\nGerasimov also translated Ars grammatica by Aelius Donatus, juxtaposing the Latin grammar against that of Church Slavonic and proposing a terminology for Slavic grammar.

He was later appointed as UMNO Youth Vice Chief in 1993 before acting as UMNO Youth Chief from the following year until 1996.\nHe was also appointed as the Chairman of the International Affairs Bureau of the Malaysian UMNO Youth Movement from 1986 to 1996 and the Chairman of the Barisan Nasional Malaysia Youth from 1990 to 1994. In addition, he was also appointed as a Member of the UMNO Supreme Council from 1990 to 2018.\nHe was appointed chairman of MARA from 17 March 1993 to 23 July 1995, Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department from 1995 to 1999 and Deputy Minister of Finance II since 1999 until the dissolution of the Cabinet ahead of the general election in December 1999. He was later appointed Minister of Entrepreneur Development until 2004.\nHis experience as a Member of Parliament began after winning the Chenderoh parliamentary seat on the Barisan Nasional ticket in the 1995 Malaysian general election which he later successfully defended in the next term, (1999-2004). In addition, he was appointed Senator of the Senate from 1991 to 1995.\nIn the 2004 Malaysian general election, he moved to the Padang Rengas parliamentary seat as a result of the demarcation by the Election Commission of Malaysia (EC). He managed to win it after defeating the PKR candidate, Mohd Zolkafli bin Yahaya. He managed to retain the seat in 2008, 2013 and 2018 general elections.\nNazri was originally the Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of legal affairs and judicial reform since 2004. After the 2008 general election, which saw the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition's majority in Parliament significantly reduced, the then Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi reshuffled his cabinet and gave Nazri's legal affairs portfolio to Zaid Ibrahim but only lasted for 6 months when Zaid resigned in September 2008. He was the Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of law and parliamentary affairs as of 2008."

He studied medicine in Freiburg, qualifying in 1891. He left the German Empire in 1894, where his father was a banker in Wiesbaden, and lived in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nHe apparently discovered, or was more thoroughly converted to, Nietzsche in 1905 or 1906 via a patient. The 18-volume Nietzsche translation he oversaw appeared from 1909 to 1913. His collaborators were Francis Bickley, Paul V. Cohn, Thomas Common, William S. Haussman, J.M. Kennedy, Anthony Ludovici, Maximilian A. Mugge, Maude D. Petre, Horace B. Samuel, Hermann Georg Scheffauer, G.T. Wrench and Helen Zimmern. Ludovici became his most important follower. In general he found little British support, but A.R. Orage was an enthusiast and Levy found an outlet in The New Age.\nSubsequently, his life was complicated by having to leave the United Kingdom and his medical practice despite his support for the British side against the Central Powers when World War I broke out. He went back to the German Empire in 1915 and then to Switzerland. Back in the United Kingdom in 1920, he incautiously wrote a preface for an inflammatory political pamphlet by George Pitt-Rivers, The World Significance of the Russian Revolution. He was deported as an alien in 1921. He then lived in the French Third Republic.\nEventually he returned to the United Kingdom. He died in Oxford. He was married to Frieda Brauer. His daughter Maud lived in Oxford, having married the bookseller Albi Rosenthal. His grandson is television sports presenter Jim Rosenthal and his great-grandson is actor Tom Rosenthal.\nIn 2004, his papers were deposited in the Nietzsche-Haus in Sils Maria."

He made his film debut in Ill Met by Moonlight. His grandparents were from Kiev and escaped the Russian pogroms, arriving in London in about 1890. The family moved to Portsmouth at the turn of the century. Morris was one of nine children born to Becky (n\u00e9e Levine) and Morry Steinberg. His younger brother, Aubrey Morris, was also an accomplished actor. His daughter Shona Morris became a stage actress.Morris trained as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, graduating in 1943. In his career, spanning five decades, he appeared in almost 90 different films and TV shows, as well as appearing in numerous stage plays as a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. His best-known role on television was as Thomas Cromwell in The Six Wives of Henry VIII. In preparation for it, he visited a number of English castles to study the characters' portraits. In 1968, he played Gollum in the BBC Radio dramatisation of The Hobbit, and later starred as the mad waxworks owner in the Amicus horror anthology film The House That Dripped Blood (1970). His other films included The Abominable Snowman (1957), The Camp on Blood Island (1958), I Only Arsked!

        "content": "In 1861, Allan Pinkerton was hired by Samuel H. Felton, president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, to investigate secessionist activity and threats of damage to the railroad in Maryland. Pinkerton went to work placing agents at various points in Maryland to investigate this potential activity. As the investigation proceeded, Pinkerton became aware that the activity in Maryland did not just end with the railroad; it also included the president-elect, Abraham Lincoln. Pinkerton received permission to continue his investigation and focus on the possible assassination plot. Warne was one of five agents sent to Baltimore, Maryland, on February 3, 1861, to investigate the hotbed of secessionist activity.During the investigation, evidence unveiled a plot to assassinate Lincoln on his way to take office. Under the aliases Mrs. Cherry and Mrs. M. Barley (M.B.), Warne tracked suspicious movement among the Baltimore secessionists. It was in part through her undercover work in the guise of a wealthy Southern lady visiting Baltimore \"with a thick southern accent\", allowing her to infiltrate secessionist social gatherings in the Baltimore area. This included the classy Barnum Hotel, also known as Barnum's City Hotel, allowing her to verify a plot to assassinate Lincoln and develop details of how the assassination was going to occur. Pinkerton had agents across Maryland, but it was Warne specifically who supplied many of the key details that led Pinkerton to believe that the plot was imminent. Warne had befriended secessionists in Maryland and collected many details about the plot to assassinate Lincoln.The president-elect, Abraham Lincoln, was traveling from his home in Springfield, Illinois, to the Capital via a train tour that was to stop at notable cities along the way. His published program showed that Lincoln's last leg of the journey was from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to Washington, D.C. Due to the configuration of the rail system, all southbound trains required a transfer to be made in Baltimore, Maryland. The tracks from points north ended at Calvert Street and the tracks heading south started at Camden Street (now the Camden Yards station). The distance between these two stations was about a mile by carriage ride. The secessionist plot to kill Lincoln was said to be that when Lincoln was passing through part of Calvert St. Station, a row or fight would occur, resulting in police officers rushing out, leaving Lincoln \"entirely unprotected and at the mercy of a mob of Secessionists\" that would then surround him. It was further alleged that a small steamship had been charted, sitting in a nearby river, on which the murderers would flee, and travel immediately to the state of Virginia.After seeing the pieces of the plot coming together, Pinkerton directed Kate Warne to take the 5:10 evening train to New York City on the morning of February 18. Once there, she was to set up a meeting with Norman B. Judd and give him a letter from Pinkerton outlining the known details of the assassination attempt. After receiving the details of the Baltimore Plot from Warne, Judd set up a meeting between himself, Pinkerton, and Lincoln on February 21. At this meeting, Lincoln was doubtful of the existence of an assassination plot or that if such a plot existed that it should be taken seriously.\nHowever, a second independent source confirmed the plot by way of Frederick W. Seward, son of William H. Seward (the secretary of state\u2013designate). From this point, Lincoln agreed that the assassination plot was plausible enough to take action. Lincoln decided to avoid hazard where it was not necessary; however, he refused to cancel any of his scheduled plans in Harrisburg. His agenda included: giving three speeches, raising of the American flag at Independence Hall, and attending a high-profile dinner.Train arrangements were made accordingly that allowed Lincoln to fulfill his scheduled duties in Harrisburg. It was not until 5:45 at night that there was any deviation from his schedule. John George Nicolay, Lincoln's private secretary, interrupted the dinner party to excuse the president-elect. Lincoln then changed into a traveling suit and a soft felt cap. He carried a shawl upon one arm to play the role of an invalid. Pinkerton, meanwhile, had the telegraph lines interrupted to prevent any knowledge of the deviation in Lincoln's schedule. At the station, Warne entered the sleeping car through the rear along with Pinkerton, Ward Hill Lamon, and a still-disguised Lincoln. She greeted Lincoln loudly as she would have a true brother.\nFrom Harrisburg, Abraham Lincoln rode to Philadelphia by a special Pennsylvania Railroad train. From Philadelphia he went to Baltimore by a special Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore train on the night of February 22\u201323. It is said that Kate Warne did not sleep a wink on the overnight trip from Pennsylvania to Washington D.C. The disguises provided by Warne that night enabled Lincoln to make it through Baltimore without recognition and take his seat in the White House. It is believed that Pinkerton came up with the slogan to his agency \"we never sleep\" as a result of Warne's guard of Lincoln that night. Warne was key in the foiled Baltimore assassination plot \u2013 not only did she help uncover its details, but she also carried out most of the arrangements to smuggle Lincoln into Washington, D.C. She couriered secret information and set up meetings as well as securing the necessary four berths on a train leaving Philadelphia under the pretext that these berths were for her sick brother and family members. The train pulled out shortly before 11 p.m. and arrived in Baltimore about 3:30 a.m. on February 23. Warne remained in Baltimore as the sleeping cars with Lincoln on board were shifted to another train, which arrived in Washington around 6 a.m.As such, it has been stated that Warne was instrumental not only in Lincoln's safe passage to take the oath of office but in convincing Pinkerton that there was a plot to assassinate Lincoln in Baltimore."

        "content": "After the quelled assassination attempt on president-elect Abraham Lincoln, Kate Warne continued to travel with Allan Pinkerton as his Female Superintendent of Detectives. On April 12, 1861, the Confederate States of America's cannons in Charleston began firing on Fort Sumter. These cannon shells marked the beginning of the American Civil War. Within nine days, Pinkerton wrote to President Lincoln offering the services of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. However, before Lincoln could respond, Major General George B. McClellan asked Pinkerton to set up a military intelligence service for McClellan's command. Therefore, by the end of July 1861, Pinkerton took Warne, Timothy Webster, and later George Bangs west to set up a headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio, to follow McClellan's Ohio division (see also Cincinnati in the Civil War).During the American Civil War, Allan Pinkerton and Kate Warne were used as a covert war intelligence-gathering bureau. Warne could easily penetrate into Southern social gatherings. She said that women are most useful in worming out secrets in many places which would be impossible for a male detective. Believed to be a mistress of Pinkerton, Warne would often pose as his wife while undercover. She also had an assortment of alias names: Kay Warne, Kay Waren, Kay Warren, Kate Waren, Kate Warren, Kitty Warne, Kitty Waren, Kitty Warren, Kittie Waren, Kittie Warne, and Kittie Warren. Warne was known as \"Kitty\" to Robert Pinkerton, Allan's brother. Robert Pinkerton often argued with Warne over expenses turned over to the agency, but her relationship with Allan continued for years. It was also rumored that the close working relationship between Allan and Warne was intimate."

        "content": "After the Civil War, Kate Warne worked on various high-profile cases. One of these involved the murder of a bank-teller, George Gordon. The murderer got away with $130,000. Pinkerton determined that Gordon was fetching money for a friend or someone who frequented the bank when he was struck on the head behind the ear with a hammer with intent to murder any witnesses of the robbery. Through his investigation, Pinkerton felt certain that his prime suspect, Alexander P. Drysdale, had in fact killed Gordon. However, at this point he did not have enough hard evidence to convict Drysdale; too much was still based on speculation. Therefore, he set a trap for Drysdale so that he would reveal a confession. Warne was sent undercover as a Mrs. Potter and became close friends with Mr. Drysdale's wife. Through this plot, they were able to uncover where Drysdale had hidden the stolen money.Another case for which Kate Warne went undercover was brought about by a Captain Sumner, who was convinced that both his sister, Mrs. Annie Thayer, and a Mr. Pattmore, were attempting to poison Mrs. Pattmore and himself. Warne took the name Lucille and assumed the role of a fortune teller to lure information out of the suspected murderer's confidants. In the meantime, she also continually coordinated Pinkerton's other female detectives in the agency. Pinkerton rented a space for Warne to work as part of her guise. Allan Pinkerton named Kate Warne one of the five best detectives that he had. Her employment by Pinkerton was a significant moment in Women's History. Women were not allowed to be a part of the police force until 1891 and could not be officers until 1908.Pinkerton specifically thanked Kate Warne and Timothy Webster in his memoirs. Both Warne and Webster were key operatives during the Baltimore Plot investigations. Warne reported back to Pinkerton about all her work when he was away from the office and they worked together, on numerous cases, during their tenure. Pinkerton constantly showed a deep trust in the work that Warne performed and acknowledges so in his memoirs. She was in charge of the Female Detective Bureau established by Pinkerton, her title being Supervisor of Women Agents. Pinkerton said to his female prospective agents that they would serve their children \"better than on the field,\" and added he had \"several female operatives,\" supporting his case by noting, \"if you agree to come aboard you will go in training with the head of my female detectives, Kate Warne. She has never let me down.Since the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed many of the unpublished records of Pinkerton detective agency, little of her life beyond Pinkerton's words, which detailed cases his agency solved is known. Erin Allen, who managed the Library of Congress blog, called Warne an \"intriguing figure\" and speculated that little documentation remains \"because she was a good spy.\""

Her gravestone is marked under the misspelled surname of \"Warn\", and states that she died of \"congestion of the lungs.\" It was said that she died of pneumonia, and estimated at the age of 35 when she died.Pinkerton wanted her burial plot to be undisturbed, so he took care of the issue in his will. Warne's burial plot could never be sold. An obituary in the Democratic Enquirer of McArthur, Ohio on March 19, 1868, described her as \"marked woman amongst her sex\" who had \"great mental power\" and was \"an excellent judge of character\" and called her the \"best female detective in America, if not in the world.\" The Pinkerton detective agency later stated that she was \"a source of inspiration\" in the agency's history, and stated that the agency continued to carry on her legacy with female detectives working at the agency. Others have called Warne a trailblazer for those women who served as protectors of the United States President and in the United States Secret Service."

Silberman, ran, and was described as \"delightful\" and \"homespun\".In the 2014 Channel Zero TV series The Pinkertons, a fictionalized Kate Warne is played by Martha MacIsaac. The series was produced in collaboration with the Pinkerton detective agency.In 2015, Kate Hannigan published The Detective's Assistant, a historical fiction based on the cases of Kate Warne. In 2016, Elizabeth Van Steenwyk would publish a picture book about Warne's story. Greer Macallister's detective story and historical novel, Girl in Disguise, released in 2017, features Warne and tells her story. One reviewer called it a glimpse into a \"19th century cloak and dagger world.\"In August 2021, Amazon Studios acquired the distribution rights to an upcoming film produced by Seven Bucks Productions starring Emily Blunt as Warne. There have been no updates on this project since then, as noted by Collider in January 2023. In the 2022 History Channel mini-series, Abraham Lincoln, Kate Warne is played by Natalie Robbie with her mission to safely deliver the newly elected Abraham Lincoln to Washington D.C.In addition, the popular YouTube series \"Puppet History\" has an episode which describes a simplified version of the Baltimore Plot. The episode, entitled \"How America's First Female Detective Saved Abe Lincoln,\" mainly focuses on Warne and how she aided in saving the life of the president elect.

However, it was straight from graduating at National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) that she got her big break with the part of Esther Wolcott in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) series Seven Little Australians.  Allegedly the producers had all but given up on the show, because they did not feel that they had found a suitable actress for the part, until they discovered Alexander.  She was actually younger than actress Barbara Llewellyn, who played her stepdaughter Meg in the series, but producers and audiences felt that they were both convincing in their roles.\nThe ten-part series delivered huge ratings when it was broadcast in 1973, and was also the first ABC series to enjoy international acclaim. It went on to win three Australian Film Institute Awards and four Penguins, including best drama series and the 1974 George Wallace Memorial Logie for Best New Talent for Alexander as the sweet-tempered Esther.  The series is now available on DVD.\nAlexander had a recurring guest role in the high rating Australian medical drama All Saints as the viper-like Dr. Alison Newell, ex-wife of Dr. Frank Campion, played by John Howard.  She was not initially written as his ex-wife, as her character appeared before Howard joined the cast.  Apparently, it was the sharp onscreen dynamic between Alexander and Howard in their early scenes together that made the writers decide to write this history into Alexander's character.\nOther television credits include:  Home and Away (she played Christine Jones, the overprotective conservative mother of Melody Jones), Silent Number, Special Squad, Chopper Squad, Farscape, Murder Call, Seven Deadly Sins (Pride), Salem's Lot and Time Trax, a science fiction series in which she starred as a computer hologram alongside Dale Midkiff.\nHer film work includes: the lead role in The Killing of Angel Street (which won an award at the Berlin Film Festival) opposite John Hargreaves, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, Summerfield with Nick Tate and John Waters, Sebastian and the Sparrow and The Journalist with Sam Neill.  2010 saw her appear in a thriller called The Clinic and in 2011 she made an appearance in Fred Schepisi's The Eye of the Storm.\nHer theatre credits are also numerous and include:  Hermione in The Winter's Tale, Portia in The Merchant of Venice for which she received glowing reviews, Martha in the Sydney Theatre Company's production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? for which she again received extremely positive reviews, Kate in another STC production of Harold Pinter's Old Times and many more.  She also played anthropologist Margaret Mead in David Williamson's play Heretic.  The play, based on Mead's life and work, was the subject of much debate and controversy due to the very public row between the writer, Williamson, and the director Wayne Harrison over the play's production.Alexander has also directed a number of plays and written several screenplays, including a short film titled Memento (which was sold to Village Roadshow) which she also directed, about the emotional problems caused by the return of a father to his family, a young boy and his mother.  She also directed a feature film,  A Spy in the Family.  Alongside this she also does voiceover work."

Randa Kassis is the former president of the Coalition of Secular and Democratic Syrians and member of the Syrian National Council. The Coalition of Secular and Democratic Syrians, the nucleus of a secular and democratic Syrian opposition, was created by the union of a dozen Muslim, Christian, Arab and Kurdish parties, who called upon minorities in Syria to support the fight against the government of Bashar al-Assad. Kassis believes in the power of minorities and their role in society, especially in Kurds and highlighted in 2013 the importance of involving Kurds in any political process in Syria.Kassis is no longer a member of the Syrian National Council, having been excluded due to her many declarations alerting the Syrian opposition about the rise of Muslim fundamentalists.Kassis is also an anthropologist and journalist. She has also published a book called \"Crypts of The Gods\", which is a book on religions, their origins, and their ways of functioning. Since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War on March 15, 2011, she has become a leading commentator on the Syrian Conflict and the wider complexities of the Arab Spring and the future of the Middle East region. \nRanda Kassis initiated the Astana platform in 2015 after her request to the President of Kazakhstan to form a platform that could assemble moderate Syrian opponents. The first round of the Astana platform was moderated by Kazakh Ambassador Baghdad Amreyev and the opening session was chaired by the Kazakh  Minister of Foreign Affairs Erland Idrissov. The second round was moderated by Fabien Baussart, President of the Center of Political and Foreign Affairs (CPFA).Randa Kassis participated in the 2016 Geneva Peace Talks under the banner of the Moscow/Astana groups. She is Co-President with Qadri Jamil of the Syrian secular and democratic opposition delegation. She is criticized by other opposition members for her advocacy to a political transition in cooperation with Bashar al-Assad's regime and her support of the Russian intervention in the civil war.In 2017, Kassis invited many members of the Syrian opposition, academics and constitutionalists with the help of French constitutionalist expert Xavier Latour, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Yasar Yakis and former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy Giulio Terzi, in order to start drafting a new constitution for Syria.On 30 January 2018 Randa Kassis, along with other members of the Astana platform, participated in the Syrian National Congress as President of the Astana platform. Kassis emphasized the importance of creating a constitutional committee in order to facilitate the peace process in Syria, which the UN and Astana troika \u2013 Russian, Iran and Turkey \u2013 later agreed to create.\nOctober 2018, Kassis worked to include many political factions of the opposition to reach a road map to peace. The document was drawn up by representatives of the opposition invited to Rome by Sant'Egidio, an organisation closed to the Vatican."

On 11 December 1937, he was aboard the USS Panay on the Yangtze Patrol in Nanking at the prompting of George Atcheson, a U.S. Embassy official. Also aboard were Universal News cameraman Norman Alley, Movietone News' Eric Mayell, the New York Times's Norman Soong, Collier's Weekly correspondent Jim Marshall, and La Stampa correspondent Sandro Sandri. Atcheson had invited them aboard the Panay so that they could document the fall of the city from relative safety. The four journalists had been covering the ongoing Japanese invasion of China in the mid-1930s, and found themselves in the thick of things in early December 1937 as Japanese forces moved on Nanking.According to Alley, writing in his memoir I Witness, Atcheson proclaimed that aboard the gunboat the group would be \"as safe as you would be on good old American soil.\"  Little did any of them know that in just a week's time, the Panay would be attacked and sunk, Sandri killed, and that they would witness the Rape of Nanking.\nDuring the attack Barzini, although wounded, performed heroically helping to bring the wounded ashore and providing first aid to the best of his ability. As Sandri, known as \"the Floyd Gibbons of Italy,\" was stretched out in the reeds with excruciatingly painful, fatal stomach wounds, Barzini could only comfort him with an occasional cigarette and a word from time to time. This episode of the incident was captured on Alley's and Mayell's cameras and in a 1937 Wide World Photos shot titled \"Consoling dying Panay victim\"."

He also wrote Down the Programmed Rabbit-Hole, a collection of essays on 1970s corporate figures.\nHaden-Guest frequently turns to upscale Manhattan social life for his subject matter as seen in the following sample of his work from Rolling Stone:\n \nThe lead singer had been married to one of those decadent European rich so numerous in Manhattan nowadays\u2014\"International White Trash,\" as the uncharitable put it\u2014and there was a sizeable splinter group of fashionable uptown faces cruising among the downtown regulars, their expressions mingling curiosity, distaste, alarm. We fetched drinks. Making small talk would have been strenuous ... We left. He got into a Maserati the colour of arterial blood. The three of us followed in the rich girl's Mercedes. Although almost brand-new, it was already dented and scarred by careless driving.\n\nOne reviewer said about Haden-Guest's book The Last Party: Studio 54, Disco and the Culture of the Night:\nBritish socialite and writer Anthony Haden-Guest has been a champion party-goer for more than 30 years. There are few people more qualified to lead a reader, as he does in The Last Party, past the velvet ropes and doorman and into the tornado of 1970s disco, drug excess, and excessive sex that was Studio 54. Unlike some of his contemporaries whose memories are dulled by years of hard living, Haden-Guest seems to actually recall many of his experiences at Studio. His book is therefore part personal memoir, part reportage.\nHaden-Guest was a guest on Charlie Rose while promoting his book True Colors: The Real Life of the Art World.\nIn 2017 Haden-Guest released a spoken word album The Further Chronicles of Now with accompanying music written and performed by Keith Patchel."

He married in Lublin, and in 1840 left for Odessa, then a centre of the Haskalah movement. He obtained there a commercial position, made the acquaintance of the Maskilim of the city, and in his leisure hours continued to work for his self-education. Later he opened a clothing-store, and was himself cutter in his tailoring-shop.\nIn 1860 Zederbaum succeeded in obtaining the government's permission to publish Ha-Melitz, the first Hebrew periodical issued in Russia; and three years later he began publishing the pioneer Yiddish journal Kol Mevasser. After an existence of eight years the latter paper was suppressed by the government, whereupon Zederbaum went to Saint Petersburg, obtaining permission to transfer the headquarters of Ha-Melitz to that city. He was also granted permission to do his own printing, and to publish, besides Ha-Melitz, a Russian weekly (Vyestnik Ruskich Yedreed), which, however, enjoyed only a short existence, as did also the \"Razsvyet,\" which he started a few years later. In 1881 he founded the Volksblatt, a daily Yiddish journal which existed for eight years, although Zederbaum was its editor for only a few years. In 1884 Zederbaum invited rising Yiddish author Mordecai Spector to join him as an assistant editor of the paper, after publishing his breakthrough novel Der Yidisher Muzhik (The Jewish Farmer). The two worked together until 1887.Zederbaum was the author of \"Keter Kehunnah\" and \"Ben ha-Metsarim,\" but neither of these works met with any success. His chief significance lies in the fact that he was a champion of the Haskalah. His Kol Mevasser offered an opportunity for many of the best jargon-writers to develop their talents; and among these may be mentioned Yitzkhok Yoel Linetzky, Mendele Mocher Sforim, Mordecai Spector, and Sholem Aleichem.\nZederbaum exercised considerable influence in government circles, and it was due to his intercession that an impartial judgment was obtained for many Jewish families accused of blood libel in Kutaisi; he disclosed also the ignorance of the Russian anti-Semite Hippolytus Lutostansky, whose pamphlets threatened to become dangerous for the Russian Jews. The Palestine Association of Odessa owed its existence to Zederbaum's activity."

Following this, he joined the drama company of Gubbi Veeranna, a notable theatre director during the time. Film director B. R. Panthulu happened to visit the drama company, saw his acting on stage and offered him a film role, beginning his career as a movie actor. He appeared as an antagonist in the film Kalachakra, a performance that was appreciated. He appeared in over a hundred Kannada films playing mostly comic roles, that starred Rajkumar.\nIn order to make the Kannada film industry self-reliant and save money for the producers, Balakrishna started the studio, investing all of his money and property. He built the Abhiman studio in Kengeri, Bangalore, on a 20-acre plot in 1963, but faced difficulties initially. When no Kannada films were being made, Balakrishna got together with other actors like Rajkumar and G. V. Iyer and produced the film Ranadheera Kanteerava. He even raised money from the public at \u20b91 per person to build the studio. The studio was a failure, and Balakrishna died in penury.

Although Ceravolo\u2019s work shares some of the same warmth and immediacy that typifies some of the other New York School Second Generation, his work is less prone to use conversational language and is often less directly humorous than much New York School writing.  Influences on Ceravolo\u2019s poetry include Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams and E. E. Cummings as well as Asian and Native American poetry.\nMany of Ceravolo\u2019s poems are marked by distorted syntax, elisions, juxtaposition and fragments (a trait he shares with Clark Coolidge, a writer also sometimes associated with the second generation of the New York School) resulting in poems that surprise with their refracted meanings and misdirections.  The structure and shape of Ceravolo\u2019s poetry changed over the course of his career: the poems of one of Ceravolo\u2019s early books, Fits of Dawn, are characterized by a dense, relentless gush of words; Ceravolo\u2019s poems (such as in Spring in this World of Poor Mutts) then increasingly experiment with spacing and twists added by conjunction and preposition; poems in Ceravolo\u2019s later books tend to be more direct and lyrical, although parataxis is still prevalent.\nCeravolo\u2019s poems often focus on the natural world, as opposed to the social world.  The titles of almost all of his books contain a reference to natural phenomena (Fits of Dawn, Wild Flowers Out of Gas, Spring In This World of Poor Mutts, Millennium Dust) and the same is true of the titles of his individual poems. Sometimes simple, sometimes elliptical, Ceravolo\u2019s poems shortcut conventional description, and as Kenneth Koch says they become almost as physical as the natural world encountered in them. An example is the poem \u201cDrunken Winter\u201d. \nAn enthusiasm can be found in much of Ceravolo\u2019s work, exemplified by use of imperative, address and exclamation, and aided by his syntactical abstraction. A good example of this is found in his poem \u201cThe Book of Wild Flowers\u201d.\nEven where Ceravolo\u2019s poems are \u201cquiet\u201d, they possess an intensity and openness; as is the case in this passage from his poem \u201cBoth Close by Me, Both\u201d."

He became notable in linguistics for his analysis of the indigenous languages of the Americas. As a member of the society's Historical and Literary Committee, he helped build a collection of texts that described and recorded native languages. His book on their grammatical systems (M\u00e9moire sur le syst\u00e8me grammatical des langues de quelques nations indiennes de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord) won the Volney Prize of the Institute of France in 1835.\nIn 1816, he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society, and in 1820, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Du Ponceau also worked on Asian languages and was one of the first Western linguists to reject the axiomatic classification of Chinese writing as ideographic. Du Ponceau stated:\n\nThat the Chinese system of writing is not, as has been supposed, ideographic; that its characters do not represent ideas, but words, and therefore I have called it lexigraphic.\nThat ideographic writing is a creature of the imagination, and cannot exist, but for very limited purposes, which do not entitle it to the name of writing.\nThat among men endowed with the gift of speech, all writing must be a direct representation of the spoken language, and cannot present ideas to the mind abstracted from it.\nThat all writing, as far as we know, represents language in some of its elements, which are words, syllables, and simple sounds. In the first case it is lexigraphic, in the second syllabic, and in the third alphabetical or elementary.He used the example of Vietnamese, then called \"Cochinchinese,\" which used Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m, a modified form of Chinese characters. He showed that Vietnamese used the Chinese characters to represent sound, not meaning. A hundred years later, his theory was still a source of controversy."

The boy's education in the Nobility Boarding school at the Saint Petersburg University (1828-1833) was paid for by his uncle on his mother side, Nikolai Khmelnitsky, a well-known playwright of his time. From 1833 to 1847 Durov worked as a civil servant, before retiring and making literature his profession. Most of his works\u2014poems, short stories and novellas\u2014were  published in almanacs, magazines and newspapers from 1843 to 1849, prior to the arrest.In late 1847 Durov began attending Petrashevsky's Fridays. In the spring of 1849, dissatisfied with what he saw as the chaotic nature of these meetings, he\u2014along with his friends Alexander Palm and A.D.Shchelkov\u2014organised another underground circle, which included brothers Fyodor and Mikhail Dostoyevsky, Aleksey Pleshcheyev, Nikolay Speshnev, Nikolai Grigoriev, P.N.Filippov, V.A. Golovinsky and F.N.Lvov. The social and economical situation in Russia was taken as the main issue. Among the documents read there was the banned Belinsky's Letter to Gogol, and \"The Soldier Talk\" (Soldatskaya beseda), the first ever document propagating revolutionary ideas in the Russian army. Four of the circle members, Speshnev, Dostoyevsky, Filippov and Lvov, decided to organize an underground lithograph. Durov disliked the idea and in April 1849 declared his 'evenings' closed.On April 23, 1849, Durov was arrested and spent 8 months in a single camera in the Petropavlovskaya Fortress. Along with the other Petrashevtsy he was taken to the parade ground of the Semionovsky Regiment in Saint Petersburg, and lined up for execution. At the last moment the execution was stopped and it was revealed that his sentence had been commuted to katorga. Durov, along with Fyodor Dostoevsky, was sent in chains to Omsk, where he was to spend 8 years in a convict colony and the rest of his life as a soldier in Siberia.  That sentence was reduced to 4 years as a Prisoner by Nicholas I.  The sentence only commenced when the convicts entered the Prison at Omsk. Dostoyevsky wrote about his experience as a convict in Omsk in his memoir-novel Notes from the House of the Dead.\nAfter Durov's release he spent one year serving in the army as a soldier, then retired due to ill health and settled in Omsk. Having received permission to leave Siberia, he went to Odessa and stayed at his friend Palm's house. There he died in 1869, after a long illness."

Durov's short stories had a strong \"natural school\" component. His sketches (with the exception of \"The Auntie\" and \"Khalatnik\") and novellas (\"Somebody Else\u2019s Child\", \"A Novel in Notes\") were hardly original, according to Bogdanova.\nWhile Sergey Durov's literary legacy is lean, the strength of his personality made a deep impression upon the people who knew him, particularly Petrashevsky's cohorts (Pleshcheev, N.Grigoriev, A.P.Milyukov) and members of his own circle (Ch.Valikhanov, G.N.Potanin, Viktor Burenin and others). He became the prototype of Rudkovsky (in Alexander Palm's novel Alexey Slobodin), and Sornev (Pavel Kovalevsky's Life\u2019s Summary). Several poets, including Pleshcheev dedicated poems to Sergey Durov."

        "content": "In the summer of 1970, Belyakov was transferred as ambassador to Finland. His designation as ambassador was mainly because Moscow was interested in increasing the influence of the Finnish Communist Party in Finland. Belyakov mainly created relationships with the Finnish Communist Party's far left Stalinist wing and became its spiritual leader.\nBelyakov's rival counselor Viktor Vladimirov estimated that in Finland there would be some kind of revolution and he supported it by sympathizing with the strikes and writing articles in Pravda about what he perceived were Finland's \"class exploitation\".\nAnother political idea of Belyakov was to encourage the Finnish Communist Party not to accept any Comprehensive Income Policy Agreements. President Urho Kekkonen invited the counselor Vladimirov to his official residence and reproached him about Belyakov. Vladimirov sent a telegram to Moscow and criticized Belyakov's actions in Finland. Kremlin responded to the telegram by sending the Deputy Foreign Minister Vasili Vasilyevich Kuznetsov to Finland. At a secret meeting, he convinced Kekkonen that the Soviet policy towards Finland hadn't changed and Finland had a right to solve its internal policy alone. After the visit Belyakov started to create contacts outside the Finnish Communist Party, especially with the centre-right National Coalition Party and industrialists and bankers.\nBelyakov's countdown to leaving Finland started at President Kekkonen's dinner party in Kekkonen's official Tamminiemi residence where he was very drunk and behaved badly. Vladimirov sent a telegram to the Kremlin on the following day, and suggested that Belyakov be sent back to Moscow. Belyakov left in February 1971 for Moscow, never to visit Finland again.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Daniel studied law at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, and he was admitted to the bar in 1866. He joined his father's practice at Lynchburg.\nDespite being crippled from his war injury, he enjoyed oratory, particularly memorializing the Confederate war effort and excoriating Congressional Reconstruction and Republicans. He entered politics and Campbell County voters elected him as a member of the Conservative Party to represent (part-time) them alongside Rufus Murrell and Robert C. Burkholder in the House of Delegates from 1869\u201372. He did not seek re-election.\nDaniel unsuccessfully sought nomination to the U.S. House of Representatives for Virginia's 6th congressional district in 1872 and 1874, between which elections he canvassed for Conservative Party candidates in the state elections in 1873. The Funding Act which the legislature had passed in 1871 (although Daniel did not vote for it at the time) proved a major campaign issue in Virginia for the next decade. Daniel became one of its main supporters (known as \"Funders\"). Others, known as Readjusters advocated reducing payments on the bonds issued in 1871 which reaffirmed the debts Virginia had acquired before the Civil War to construct railroads, bridges, etc. Although the bonds traded at far below face value, they could be used at face value to pay state taxes, so they significantly cut state tax revenues. Also, the interest rate was kept at the prewar level, which was much higher than postwar interest rates.\nIn 1876, Daniel published his \"A Treatise on the Law of Negotiable Instruments\", which was reprinted several times. That year he also campaigned for Samuel J. Tilden, the Democratic presidential candidate (who lost). However, Campbell county voters had elected Daniel to the state senate the previous year, and he was re-elected once before resigning the part-time position in 1881. In 1877, Daniel became one of the leading Conservative orators against the leading Readjuster candidate, former Confederate general turned railroad tycoon William Mahone. Mahone  ultimately withdrew his gubernatorial candidacy in favor of relatively unknown Frederick W.M. Holliday of Winchester, Virginia, who was elected.Daniel was a presidential elector in the 1876 presidential election.In 1880, Daniel spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio in favor of the candidacy of former Union General Winfield Scott Hancock, whom he praised as offering the best hope for reconciliation between North and south.\nIn 1881, Daniel was the Conservative Party's candidate for governor of Virginia, but lost by 12,000 votes (out of 211,000 cast) to William E. Cameron, the candidate of a coalition of Republicans and Readjusters. During one state senate debate, Daniel had orated it \"were better to burn the schools...than sustain them on money taken by force\" from bondholders. Since public schools were a key innovation of the Virginia Constitution of 1869 (but Thomas Jefferson had  proposed them a century earlier), Readjusters portrayed Daniel as putting the interests of bondholders (few of whom lived in Virginia) above all others. Although Daniel had easily won re-election to the state senate in 1879, the Readjusters swept to victory in those state elections. State revenues remained insufficient to pay both bondholders and ordinary but minimal state government activities, and many school construction debts had not been paid for years.\nAfter the 1882 election, the Virginia's Conservative Party reorganized as the state's Democratic party, guided by railroad tycoon and future U.S. Senator John S. Barbour (although his cousin James Barbour favored some readjustment). On June 28, 1883, Daniel delivered the three-hour long keynote oration in the dedication of a statute of Confederate General Robert E. Lee at Washington and Lee University, which was republished by many newspapers, including outside the state. In the 1883 Virginia statewide election year, race and cronyism within the Readjuster and Republican ranks became major issues.\nAlthough Daniel was not running for office directly that year, he and Mahone were the leading candidates for the U.S. Senate seat that the General Assembly would soon select. Daniel summarized the Democratic platform, \"I am a Democrat because I am a white man and a Virginian.\" Democrats won control of the General Assembly, which was then allowed to reapportion legislative districts pursuant to the completed 1880 census. Daniel successfully defended the partisan redistricting in the Supreme Court of Appeals over Republican challenge. He also benefited because Democrats nominated him as the 6th congressional district (as he had long sought), after popular incumbent John Randolph Tucker was moved to the 10th congressional district (which he also won).\nDuring his federal service as discussed below, Daniel was a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1901. He had advocated such a convention since 1895, and was elected as Campbell County's representative without opposition. At that convention (in Richmond from June 12, 1901, until June 26, 1902), Daniel served on the suffrage committee and advocated requiring a voter to explain any section of the constitution, although some criticized his leadership. Future Senator Carter Glass of Lynchburg developed a compromise involving a poll tax and writing test which passed and became a means for disenfranchising African Americans and poor whites."

Daniel delivered a speech during dedication of the Washington Monument on February 21, 1885, which extolled Virginia's central place in the nation, then served one congressional term, from March 4, 1885, to March 4, 1887, before elected to the U.S. Senate to replace Readjuster William Mahone. Fellow Confederate veteran Samuel I. Hopkins, a member of Labor party, succeeded Daniel, served a single term (the Fiftieth Congress), declined to run for re-election, and was succeeded by a Democrat.\nIn 1887, Virginia's General Assembly elected Daniel as a Democrat to the United States Senate to succeed Readjuster Republican William Mahone. He was reelected four times: in 1891, 1897, 1904, and 1910. Thus, he served from March 4, 1887, until his death, largely cooperating with the Democratic organization created by his fellow U.S. Senator Thomas S. Martin.\nDuring his tenure, Daniel served as chairman of the Committee on Revision of the Laws of the United States (Fifty-third Congress). He was also a member of several committees, including the Committee on Corporations Organized in the District of Columbia (Fifty-fifth Congress), the Committee on Public Health and National Quarantine (Sixtieth Congress), and the Committee on Private Land Claims (Sixty-first Congress).\nDaniel staunchly supported American intervention into Cuba during the 1890s, and often spoke at length on Spanish cruelties. He also argued against repeal of the Sherman Silver Act and for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, but by 1904 realized that was an ineffective campaign issue and helped remove it from the party's national platform. He also campaigned unsuccessfully for federal funding of schools.Always interested in veterans affairs, Senator Daniel was heavily involved in the initial planning of the Virginia Memorial on the Gettysburg Battlefield, as years earlier he had helped organize Lynchburg's commemoration of General Robert E.

His parents died in his childhood and Legien grew up in an orphanage in Thorn, Province of Prussia (now Toru\u0144) from 1867 to 1875. He became a wood turner and served in the Prussian Army from 1881 to 1884. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1885, a wood turners\u2019 union in 1886 and worked as a turner in several cities in Germany until 1891, since 1886 in Hamburg.In 1887 Legien became the first chairman of the German Association of Turners and of the General Commission of the German Trade Unions (Generalkommission der Gewerkschaften Deutschlands) in 1891, a position he would hold until its dissolution in 1919. He was elected a member of the German Parliament in 1893 (until 1898) and again in 1903 (until his death in 1920). He became the leader of the SPD's right wing and opposed its more leftist factions.He took part in the International Workers Congresses of Paris, 1889.Legien became Chairman of the International Secretariat of National Trade Union Centres in 1903 and first President of the International Federation of Trade Unions in 1913 until its dissolution in 1919.In 1912, Legien gave a keynote address at the convention of the Socialist Party of America in Indianapolis which was credited with persuading the convention to reject the anarcho-syndicalist program of Bill Haywood.\nAt the outbreak of World War I he supported the war with \"patriotic fervor\" and the SPD-majority\u2019s Burgfriedenspolitik, a \"civil truce\", which assured the German government not to \"obstruct the German war effort\". Legien and other leading Social Democrats expected this policy to end the animosity and discrimination of socialist workers in Germany, while the German Empire's government (particularly the War Ministry) evaluated organised labour as an important factor in war industries. As a result, workers became a mobilized, disciplined loyal force in the war effort in return for concessions, and the German labour movement became an obstacle against opposition to war. In the context of the separation of the opposing Social Democratic minority, which led to the foundation of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), Legien and Gustav Bauer declared that the \"Jewish gang\" must be dealt with, in attempt to drive them out of their faction.Robert S. Wistrich classifies Carl Legien as belonging to a group of whom some had antisemitic tendencies.\nDuring the war he worked in variety of ways to help German war effort. He threw down calls from socialists in USA to mediate an end of the war with the German government, while defending the resumption of submarine warfare by German Kriegsmarine as response to the rejection of \"Germany's sincere offer of immediate peace negotiations\"On 15 November 1918 he signed the Stinnes-Legien Agreement with industrialist Hugo Stinnes, an agreement in which the German employers for the first time accepted nationwide unions as legitimate workers-organisations and which introduced an eight-hour day, workers councils in plants with more than 50 employees and parity employment offices. The employers agreed to stop discrimination of union members and their support of \"house unions\" (yellow unions) while the unions rejected radical socialists\u2019 demands. Most of the agreement's regulations became part of the Weimar German constitution.\nIn 1919 he became the first Chairman of the Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund. \nTo Legien the expected loss of Upper Silesia to Poland after World War I would intensify the 'psychological' impact of the \"draconian peace\" on the German working class.He countered the right-wing Kapp Putsch of March 1920 by organizing a massive general strike in Germany with about 12 million employees following the joint call of the legal government and the unions. The strike immediately halted all production, transportation, mining and public services, it was \"the strongest mass movement the German proletariat ever created\" and \"gave the Kapp r\u00e9gime its death blow\".At that time he declined Friedrich Ebert\u2019s offer to become Chancellor of Germany.Legien died after a short illness in Berlin and was buried at Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde, where his grave now forms part of the Memorial to the Socialists (German: Gedenkst\u00e4tte der Sozialisten)."

With his wife, Helen Watkins, he developed ego-state therapy, which uses analysis of underlying personalities, rather than traditional talk therapy, to find the causes of psychological problems.\nThe most famous example of the use of ego-state therapy was the interrogation of the Hillside Strangler, in which Watkins solicited a confession by revealing the killer's multiple personalities.Watkins also published research suggesting that hypnotic techniques for pain reduction may work by displacing the pain into \u201ccovert\u201d ego states. Accordingly, the pain is not eliminated by the hypnotic intervention but is dissociated from conscious awareness and fully experienced by an underlying ego state. The underlying ego state may suffer trauma as a result experiencing the pain.Watkins  graduated from the University of Idaho and received a Ph.D. from Columbia University. He was professor emeritus at the University of Montana, where he taught for many years.\nJohn G Watkins died on 12 January 2012. He was 98 years old."

        "content": "Creang\u0103 was one of the first architects in Romania to adopt the basic elements of modernist design, in designs which progressed rapidly from complex stepped forms in his first projects of the late 1920s to simple unadorned volumes, or dominant horizontal and vertical massing in the 1930s. This evolution is evident in his villas designed from 1929 to 1930, progressing from the blocky volumes elaborated with statuary and sculpture of the Cornel Medrea Villa in 1929 to the spare unadorned cubic volume of the Ion Miclescu Villa, completed the next year.\nIn 1929 Creang\u0103, in collaboration with his brother, Ion, and his wife, won the competition to design the ARO building for the Asigurarea Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 insurance company, a multi-use building including shops, offices and apartments, and eventually a cinema. Completed in 1931, after the design was simplified into simple bold horizontal and vertical masses, it is the first important large scale modernist building completed in Romania., and established Creang\u0103's career.\nIn 1935, he opened an office with architects Haralamb Georgescu and Nicolae Nedelescu, working primarily for three clients: ARO insurance, Malaxa industries, and Bucharest City Hall. For these clients Creang\u0103 designed industrial, office and residential buildings, notably including the Malaxa Industries factories (1930\u20131940), becoming one of the most respected modernists in industrial architecture.  The Encyclopedia of 20th Century Architecture states that \"..despite the austerity of Creanga's modernist vocabulary, he reached a remarkable expressive force that remained unequaled in the production of the industrial architecture.\"Throughout the 1930s, he designed numerous villas and small apartment buildings, as well as public buildings like the Stadionul Republicii. His Malaxa Factories and the Malaxa-Burileanu Building, with bold horizontal lines, unadorned surfaces and large areas of glass, are the most clearly Bauhaus influenced buildings in Romania. His large scale work of the later 1930s however showed an influence of the stylised classical of Italian architecture of the 1930s, such as the formal fa\u00e7ades, with fine vertical ribs of the ARO Palace Hotel in Bra\u0219ov and the Cultural Palace in Cern\u0103u\u021bi.\nCreang\u0103's work was not uncontroversial. The ARO building which made his reputation and influenced the embrace of Modernism in Romania was fiercely criticized as well. His works were not published by mainstream Romanian industrial publications until the late 1930s.His career was cut short by his death when he was only 51."

On 5 June 2014, Jupe said she had decided to support Jokowi because Prabowo had broken her heart as he already had a girlfriend.Ahead of Jakarta's 2017 gubernatorial election, Jupe voiced support for the incumbent, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known as Ahok, who ended up losing the election and was then jailed for blasphemy against Islam. Jupe had initially considered Ahok to be fierce and creepy, but upon meeting him in March 2016 she declared him to be warm and friendly. She praised his urban planning and efforts to combat Jakarta's notorious floods and traffic. She also lauded his honesty, saying it was very difficult to find honest leaders in Indonesia."

She said CSS was not intended to be a money-making operation, but was inspired by her love of football. She fondly recalled playing football as a child with her parents and siblings in Cijantung, East Jakarta. CSS was based in Kuningan, South Jakarta, and subsequently opened coaching clinics at Bung Karno Stadium and in Simprug, South Jakarta. The school's first batch of 14 participants received free training. Subsequent participants, who had an average age of 10 to 13 years, were required to pay a Rp 1 million registration fee, plus an additional Rp 1 million for a 10-week course. Former participants recall Jupe often monitoring the training, encouraging them to exercise and sharing her passion for the game.Julia Perez served as manager of Indonesia's Team Garuda at the 21st President's Cup International Amateur Boxing Tournament held in Jakarta over 3\u20139 July 2011. Jupe said her presence fired up the team's performance. She was also enthusiastic about the team, commenting: \"The other day, I wanted to see the boxers being weighed. When I went in the room, why are they all naked? Apparently, one has to strip to be weighed. What can I say, that's my luck.\""

There was speculation at the time that she was suffering cancer and wanted to have a baby before the cancer advanced. Later that same month, Perez revealed that seven months previously (around March 2014) she had been diagnosed with Stage 2a cervical cancer. She later clarified the cancer had been identified at Stage 1b. In Singapore, she underwent chemotherapy, radiation treatment and ovarian removal. In January 2015, she announced she was looking forward to returning to showbiz work, declaring she had completely recovered from the cancer. In April 2016, she appeared publicly with her head shaved, saying it was an act of support for cancer sufferers, especially women. Despite her treatment, the cancer spread and by December 2016 had reached Stage 4. In 2017, Perez was being treated in Jakarta's Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. She had become reliant on donations from friends and supporters to cover her heavy medical bills for chemotherapy and other treatment. Among those helping to pay her bills was Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known as Ahok, who had served as Jakarta governor. During Ahok's last visit to Julia in April 2017, he said she should not worry about paying her bills.It was announced on 10 June 2017 that Perez had died of Stage 4 cervical cancer."

His father was stationed at the US Naval Air Station, where he worked with helium as a lifting gas for naval lighter-than-air aviation. The family moved almost every year to follow his military placements, including an assignment to Pearl Harbor prior to World War II. In 1943 he was sent to the western Pacific and the rest of the family settled in Haddam Neck, Connecticut.   \nIn Connecticut John Reppy became interested in herpetology, geology and rock climbing, exploring local quarries. He graduated from high school in 1950.Reppy immediately enrolled at the University of Connecticut, beginning with summer school. He majored in mathematics but also began working for his thermodynamics instructor Charles Reynolds. At this time Reppy became friends with David M. Lee, who was also a student. Reppy received a bachelor's degree in math and physics in 1954 at University of Connecticut and a master's degree from the same school two years later.In 1956, Reppy joined Cecil T. Lane's Yale Low Temperature group at Yale University.  As part of his Ph.D. work, Reppy adapted a design by Jesse Beams and built an apparatus for rotating a container of liquid helium in vacuum and measuring the helium's angular momentum.  He completed his dissertation in 1960, and received his Ph.D from Yale University in 1961.  Reppy spent 1961  working with Nicholas Kurti in Oxford on a National Science Foundation (NSF) Fellowship."

The well-known Reppy's Crack on Cannon Mountain in New Hampshire bears his name and he has made first ascents as of  number of routes in the Shawangunks and elsewhere. He made early attempts on Armadillo, a long alpine rock climb on Mount Katahdin, Maine. In addition, he has climbed extensively in England, the Alps and western America.\nReppy has said his earliest interest in rock climbing as a very young teenager was related to the re-opening of small open-pit mica mines in eastern Connecticut during World War II in response to increased war-time demand for electronics materials.Reppy was among the first climbers in the United States to practice so-called \"clean climbing\" techniques, which he learned in England. While most climbers of the day were hammering their way up the cliffs with pitons, Reppy helped introduce the use of nuts, which at the time consisted of hex nuts from truck wheels, strung with nylon webbing. Unlike pitons, nuts are placed and removed without the use of hammers and save the rock from permanent damage. The technique often makes placements easier and faster to achieve, and thus may make difficult climbs easier to complete. Many advances in rock climbing were made possible by this method. Among a substantial number of others deserving credit for this trend in the U.S. are Yvon Chouinard and John Stannard."

He joined the Cornell University Physics Department in 1966, becoming the John Wetherill Professor of Physics in 1987.\nAs physics professor at Cornell University, he studies quantum properties of superfluids with an emphasis on boundary conditions and phase transitions in systems of reduced dimensionality. \nReppy's research group has close associations with  David M. Lee and Robert C. Richardson also of Cornell, who shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physics with Douglas D. Osheroff for discoveries related to super fluidity in helium-3 ice. Lee, in his Nobel Prize speech, credited Reppy's \"extraordinary technical ingenuity\"  in experiments leading to the discovery. In the speech, Lee made other references to Reppy, noting that his work helped confirm related insights.Reppy also figured at least on the fringes of the 2001 Nobel Prize for Physics which was awarded to Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman of the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics, or JILA, in Boulder, Colo., and Wolfgang Ketterle of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Bose\u2013Einstein condensation was predicted in 1924, and was seen decades ago in liquid helium, according to Ketterle, who acknowledged a controversial earlier claim by Reppy. Ketterle says that Reppy brought this finding to his attention, and that the priority claim was fair. \"I think the results appeared conclusive\", Ketterle reportedly said.  Co-laureate Wieman reportedly said that Reppy's claim is \"really a stretch\" and that \"Ketterle is being gracious\".Physicists generally agree that the atoms in superfluid helium-4 is not a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate in the original sense of the term because its atoms interact too strongly. Reppy studied an exception: tiny amounts of helium trapped in nanometer-sized pores of a spongelike glass called Vycor. Even though the pores keep its atoms too far apart to jostle one another much, the helium still behaves like a three-dimensional fluid. In 1983 Reppy and colleagues reported results that suggested the helium was sloshing through the glass as a true Bose\u2013Einstein condensate.\nSeparately, work from Cornell physics laboratories has been used to test a theory of cosmic strings, hypothetical objects, which may have been important in the formation of galaxies, and may have arisen through  \"phase transitions\" in a fraction of a second after the Big Bang."

He doctored in law at the University of Zagreb and later studied music at the Zagreb Academy of Music under Blagoje Bersa and Franjo Dugan. Bjelinski started composing in the 1930s. By the beginning of World War II he had finished his 2 sonatas for violin and piano, 3 piano suites and a toccata. During World War II he was sent to a concentration camp, but in 1943, with the help of a friend, he escaped and joined the Partisans on the island of Kor\u010dula.

Bjelinski never belonged expressly to the \u201cnational course\u201d but he was far from indifferent to folk music (the influence of idiosyncratic Balkan rhythms and even of exotic South American dances mirroring the impressions of the composer's repeated stays in Brazil, with occasional inspirations by the particular features of jazz). The fundamental features of this sensitive and easily recognisable musical speech are a light Mediterranean lyricism, a general facility of expression and a message that is always optimistic, all interwoven with occasional dramatically accumulated sounds. Visible in his work are traces of Baroque music with its incessant kinetic motion and well-thought-out structures. But neo-Classical impulses are always at the roots of his creative work; rejecting all that is outside the tried and tested laws of classical order, the composer, respecting these same laws, also played with them a little. The unpretentious poeticism of his works is often suffused with a gentle humour that occasionally borders on irony. Bjelinski successfully tried his hand at almost all the areas of serious music."

He accidentally irradiated himself on August 21, 1945, during a critical mass experiment at the remote Omega Site of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico and died 25 days later from the resultant radiation poisoning.\nDaghlian was irradiated as a result of a criticality accident that occurred when he accidentally dropped a tungsten carbide brick onto a 6.2 kg bomb core made of plutonium\u2013gallium alloy. This core, subsequently nicknamed the \"demon core\", was later involved in the death of another physicist, Louis Slotin."

His father was from Gaziantep, Turkey. He had a sister, Helen, and a brother, Edward. Soon after his birth the family moved across state to the coastal town of New London, Connecticut. He was educated at Harbor Elementary School, where he played violin in the school orchestra, and at Bulkeley High School. In 1938, at the age of 17, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, intending to study mathematics, but became interested in physics, particularly particle physics, which was then emerging as an exciting new field. This interest led him to transfer to the West Lafayette, Indiana, campus of Purdue University, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1942. He then commenced work on his doctorate, assisting Marshall Holloway with the cyclotrons. In 1944, while still a graduate student, he joined Otto Frisch's Critical Assembly Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory of the Manhattan Project."

        "content": "During an experiment on August 21, 1945, Daghlian was attempting to build a neutron reflector manually by stacking a set of 4.4-kilogram (9.7 lb) tungsten carbide bricks in an incremental fashion around a plutonium core. The purpose of the neutron reflector was to reduce the mass required for the plutonium core to attain criticality. He was moving the final brick over the assembly, but neutron counters alerted Daghlian to the fact that the addition of that brick would render the system supercritical. As he withdrew his hand, he inadvertently dropped the brick onto the center of the assembly. Since the assembly was nearly in the critical state, the accidental addition of that brick caused the reaction to go immediately into the prompt critical region of neutronic behavior. This resulted in a criticality accident.Daghlian reacted immediately after dropping the brick and attempted to knock the brick off the assembly without success. He was forced to disassemble part of the tungsten-carbide pile in order to halt the reaction.Daghlian was estimated to have received a dose of 510 rem (5.1 Sv) of neutron radiation, from a yield of 1016 fissions. Despite intensive medical care, he developed symptoms of severe radiation poisoning, and his sister and widowed mother were flown out to care for him. He fell into a coma and died 25 days after the accident. He was the first known fatality caused by a criticality accident. His body was returned to New London, where he was buried at Cedar Grove Cemetery."

        "content": "As a result of the incident, safety regulations for the project were scrutinized and revised. A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions and designs for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading to the creation of the Godiva device.These changes did not prevent another criticality accident from happening at Los Alamos the following year. Louis Slotin, a colleague of Daghlian's, was killed in 1946 while performing criticality tests on the same plutonium core. After these two incidents it became known as the \"demon core\", and all similar criticality experiments were halted until remote-controlled assembly devices were more fully developed and available.In 2000, the city of New London erected a memorial stone and flagpole in Calkins Park to honor Daghlian. His surname is misspelled \"Daghiian\" on the monument. The monument bears an inscription: \"though not in uniform, he died in service to his country.\""

        "content": "Born in the village of Trylies, then part of the Sto\u016dbtsy Raion within the Minsk Region of the Soviet Union's Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Lebedko emerged in the 1990s as one of the leading critics of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, whom Lebedko, along with other opposition leaders and many western governments, considers a dictator.\nLebedko's strident opposition to Lukashenka led to increasingly bitter confrontations with the Belarusian authorities through the late 1990s and into the 2000s. He was arrested numerous times for participating in unsanctioned protests and marches, including the 1999 Freedom March; was charged with libel against Lukashenko several times; and was beaten outside his home by masked men he alleges were connected to Lukashenko. Lebedko appears to have drawn particular ire for his relatively high visibility and frequent contact with groups outside Belarus, who Lukashenko accuses of meddling in Belarus's internal affairs. In particular, one of Lebedko's arrests came shortly after he had spoken on the floor of the United States Senate and at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in October 1999, prompting letters of protest from both bodies.\nFollowing an October 2004 election, which combined a referendum on permitting Lukashenko a third term with parliamentary elections, Lebedko led slightly over a thousand opposition protestors into the streets of Minsk on 18-19 October. Lebedko and other opposition leaders charged that the elections were rigged, an accusation echoed by OSCE election monitors.  During the second day of protests on October 19, Lebedko was arrested along with two other opposition leaders, Mikola Statkevich and Paval Sieviaryniets, as well as an Associated Press photographer who had been covering the protest. Lebedko's supporters claim he was severely beaten by riot police following his arrest; he ended up in the hospital, reportedly with fractured skull, broken ribs and internal injuries.\nAt the Congress of Democratic Forces in October 2005, he lost by just a few votes to Alaksandar Milinkievi\u010d, who became (with Lebedko's subsequent support) the opposition's primary candidate in the 2006 Belarusian presidential election.\nCurrently, Lebedko functions as Representative for the Constitutional Reform and Parliamentary Cooperation in the office of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya."

        "content": "Vikram was born as Kennedy John Victor on 17 April 1966 to a Christian father and a Hindu mother. His father, John Victor (alias Vinod Raj) was a native of Paramakudi and ran away from home to start a career in films, but worked only in minor roles. Vikram's mother, Rajeshwari, was a government officer who reached the rank of sub-collector. Rajeshwari was born in a Hindu family with film connections. Her brother, Thiagarajan, is an established director-actor in the Tamil film industry; he is the father of actor Prashanth, making him Vikram's first cousin (although the two have never openly acknowledged this relationship). Vikram has two siblings, both younger to him. His brother, Arvind, appeared in the low-budget Tamil film, Eppo Kalyanam (2022). His sister, Anitha, is a teacher.\nVikram's father, Vinod Raj, was a small time actor who did not fare successfully in films and only managed to act in supporting roles in Tamil films and television serials. This inspired Vikram to take theatre lessons and become professionally trained in classical and cinema dance forms to ensure that he became a leading actor. Vikram decided to use a screen name because he disliked his original name, Kennedy, and he also felt that such a foreign name was not a fit name for an actor in Tamil films. He took the name Vikram (a Hindu name) which means \"man who does great deeds.\" In one interview, he said that he was also inspired to take the name because it was a mixture of several names dear to him: \"Vi\" from his father's name (Vinod), \"K\" from Kennedy, \"Ra\" from his mother's name (Rajeshwari) and \"ram\" from his sun sign, Aries.Vikram was educated at Montfort School, Yercaud (a boarding school in a hill station near Salem) and graduated in 1983. He has mentioned that he used his opportunities at school well by taking part in karate, horseback riding and swimming and noted that such early exposure to activities gave him confidence as a youngster. Vikram lurked in the fringes of the school's theatre club for a long period and often took part in backstage work before being handed the lead role in a school adaptation of Moli\u00e8re's The Doctor in Spite of Himself after the original lead had contracted chicken pox. Despite expressing his interest to join films after school, his father forced him to go through education and Vikram subsequently graduated from Loyola College, Chennai with a degree in English Literature and worked halfway towards an MBA programme. Through the prolific dramatics club, Vikram appeared in stage productions including college adaptations of The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial and Peter Shaffer's Black Comedy, receiving best actor awards for his performances. After winning a Best Actor Award at a function held at IIT Madras, Vikram was hit by a truck during a ride on his motorbike on the way home and suffered a serious leg injury. He remained hospital-ridden for three years during college and subsequently went through twenty-three surgeries to prevent his leg from being amputated. Vikram then returned to finish the final year of his degree after his accident and secured permission to finish his dissertation at home, as he was only able to walk on crutches for a short period."

        "content": "Vikram is a prolific method actor, being often compared akin to Hollywood's Christian Bale. Since the success of Sethu, Vikram's intense performances and variety of roles have received critical acclaim. His performances as a rogue turned mentally ill patient in Sethu, a gravedigger with autism spectrum disorder in Bala's Pithamagan, a Brahmin lawyer with multiple personality disorder in Anniyan and a mentally challenged adult with the maturity of a six-year-old boy in Deiva Thirumagal are all roles in which he played a mentally affected man, with Vikram mentioning that he does such roles to reinvent himself on screen.Furthermore, Vikram has enjoyed a fan following in Andhra Pradesh as a result of a series of successful dubbed Telugu films with Aparichitudu, dubbed from his Tamil film Anniyan, being among the most successful Telugu films of 2005. All his films are thus released in Telugu soon after their original release in Tamil, while Anniyan was also dubbed in Hindi as Aparichit. He has also enjoyed success in Kerala, where his films have demanded large box office openings akin to Malayalam film stars. In 2004, Vikram participated in a live stadium stage event organised by producer P. L. Thenappan titled \"Vikram Mega Nite\". The event, held in Singapore, attracted several hundreds of his South East Asian fans and was held in the form of a stage musical. Vikram's pan-Indian popularity has also prompted him to be regularly considered for brand endorsements. In 2005, he was signed as Coca-Cola's brand ambassador in Tamil Nadu. He has been the ambassador for Brooke Bond 3 Roses, Manappuram General Finance and Leasing Ltd and Josco Jewellers since 2010. In 2015, Vikram has endorsed Big Deal TV, a celebrity-driven home shopping channel.He is amongst the most decorated actors in terms of awards in the history of Tamil cinema. He holds a National Film Award for Best Actor; a feat only matched by four other actors in Tamil films. Moreover, Vikram holds seven Filmfare Awards South, with the tally being only second to Kamal Haasan who has ten wins. In 2010 his film Raavan was promoted at the Cannes Film Festival and then screened at Venice Film Festival and the Busan International Film Festival. Within weeks of release, Deiva Thirumagal was sent to the Asia Pacific Screen Awards after it was nominated by the Film Federation of India and the National Film Development Corporation. Vikram is also a recipient of the Kalaimamani Award from the Government of Tamil Nadu in 2004. Other recognitions includes a string of Cinema Express Awards, Vijay Awards and Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, including recognition in three different categories. In 2011, Vikram was awarded an honorary doctorate from Universit\u00e0 Popolare degli Studi di Milano (People's University of Milan) in the field of Fine Arts. Vikram accepted the title on 29 May 2011 and in his next release, Deiva Thirumagal, he was credited as Dr. Chiyaan Vikram."

Wyneken's missionary experience, method, and plan influenced American Lutheran missions for many years to come.

Some of the earlier Wynekens and their relatives were minor government officials in the Duchy of Bremen-Verden when it was under Swedish control. The Wyneken family had an established Lutheran heritage long before Friedrich arrived in America. Heinrich Wyneken's father, grandfather, and one brother were pastors in Hanover. Two of Friedrich Wyneken's older brothers also became pastors. Significant numbers of more distant relatives and in-laws were also Lutheran clergy members, such as Superintendent Hans Heinrich Justus Phillip Ruperti, (1833-1899), who was Friedrich's nephew.Other Wyneken relatives had military careers in the Electorate of Hanover and others would serve in army of the Kingdom of Hanover. Friedrich Wyneken's maternal grandfather was a Rittmeister stationed in Verden. Wyneken's second cousin Christian Wilhelm August Johann Ernst Wyneken (1783- 1853) fought in the King's German Legion in Spain and at the Battle of Waterloo and later became a Lieutenant General in the Hanoverian Army and led a German contingent in the First Schleswig War. Much later a third cousin, Hans Kannengiesser (1880-1970), would fight at Gallipoli and later become a generalleutnant.Wyneken was baptized on May 22, 1810, by his father at St. Andreas Church in Verden. Heinrich Wyneken died five years later, leaving eleven children and a widow behind. Friedrich attended the gymnasium in Verden. At the age of 17 he went to the University of G\u00f6ttingen but soon enrolled at the University of Halle. Neither of these institutions had a reputation for the dogmatic Lutheran orthodoxy which Wyneken was later to embrace; rather they both promoted strong rationalistic viewpoints. At Halle, Wyneken became a student of August Tholuck, a skilled linguist and a believer in the personal religious experience.After graduation, Wyneken worked as a private instructor in Lesum (now a locality of Bremen) at the home of Consistorial Counsellor Georg von Henfstengel, himself an \"Awakened\" pastor. During this time Wyneken became more influenced by the Erweckungsbewegung (\"Awakening\" movement) led by August Tholuck. He was ordained in Stade along with his fellow theology student E. W. Wolff on May 8, 1837, and soon the pair secured free passage to America from an \"Awakened\" sea-captain, Stuerge, and the blessing of the Stade Bible and Mission Society."

        "content": "In early 1838, Wyneken sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and arrived in Baltimore, Maryland. He noted that the following year, 5000 fellow Germans arrived weekly in the relatively nearby port of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alone, most fleeing economic hardship, warfare, and political repression in the various German states\u2014and that emigration would continue until the American Civil War. Wyneken worked in Baltimore helping the ailing Rev. Johann Heaesbaert and a mixed congregation of Lutherans and Reformed (Moravians) for about a year.\nThen, as his mentor recovered, the Pennsylvania Ministerium of Lutherans sent Wyneken westward to serve the many Protestant German farmers who had moved into Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he met C. F. Schmidt, editor of Lutherische Kirchenzeitung, who would become a friend and supporter, but continued his evangelism westward. In Putnam and Allen counties in Ohio, Wyneken found Lutherans who had not heard a sermon in years, so he baptized many children, and decided to tell his fellow ministers still in Germany about the massive need for their ministry in the New World. However, first he ministered to Germans in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the nearby settlement of Friedheim, Preble Township, in northwest Adams County, whose pastor, Jesse Hoover, had died in May 1838. Then he made Fort Wayne, a portage and canal town, his base, and traveled among the isolated settlements on the Michigan Road to the north as well as in central Indiana and western Ohio.\nHe joined the Evangelical Synod of the West (despite misgivings about its ecumenical stance), and also appealed to the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod of the United States of North America for more clergy, especially for the frustrating missionary survey work, when the isolated German protestants wanted to establish their own church communities. While the General Synod did not have resources, various missionary societies in Germany did. Already in 1840, the Bremen (missionary) Society for Protestant Germans had sent two missionary pastors to America, and they sent another five in 1842.\nOn August 31, 1841, he married Sophia Marie Wilhelmine Buuch (1824\u20131891), daughter of the first settler in Friedheim. That same year, the Stade missionary society sent G. Jensen to cover Wyneken's pastoral responsibilities at St. Paul's in Fort Wayne while he and his wife returned to Germany for medical treatment of a throat ailment. There, Wyneken published Die Noth der deutschen Lutheraner in Nordamerika (English translation: The Distress of the German Lutherans in North America). This, together with his personal contacts and correspondence with Wilhelm Loehe as well as mission societies in Hanover, Bremen, Erlangen, Breslau, Leipzig, and Berlin over the next year while he received medical treatment (and began raising his first child), inspired many German ministers and theology students (22 trained by Loehe himself) to emigrate to America.While Wyneken returned to the United States in May 1843 with Adolf Biewend (who soon accepted a call from a congregation near Washington, D.C.), Loehe and Rev. Johann Friedrich Wucherer worked in Germany to send missionaries to North America, publishing Kirchliche Mitteilungen aus und ueber Nord-Amerika. Wyneken, in 1845, became the delegate of the Synod of the West to the General Synod. He then accepted a call of a Baltimore congregation, where he served for five years, then moved to St. Louis for four years.\nWyneken worked with C. F. W. Walther, who had founded Concordia Seminary in St. Louis and had become the first president of the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod. Wyneken succeeded Walther and served as the Missouri Synod's second president for fourteen years."

        "content": "The Daily Show  (TDS) is an American late-night talk and satirical news television program. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central with release shortly after on Paramount+ of extended episodes. The Daily Show draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories as well as political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humor.The half-hour-long show premiered on July 22, 1996, and was first hosted by Craig Kilborn until December 17, 1998. Jon Stewart then took over as the host from January 11, 1999, until August 6, 2015, making the show more strongly focused on political satire and news satire, in contrast with the pop culture focus during Kilborn's tenure. Stewart was succeeded by Trevor Noah, whose tenure began on September 28, 2015. Under the different hosts, the show has been formally known as The Daily Show with Craig Kilborn from 1996 to 1998, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart from 1999 until 2015, and The Daily Show with Trevor Noah from 2015 to 2022. The Daily Show is the longest-running program on Comedy Central (counting all three tenures), and has won 25 Primetime Emmy Awards.The program has been popular among young audiences. The Pew Research Center suggested in 2010 that 74% of regular viewers were between 18 and 49, and that 10% of the audience watched the show for its news headlines, 2% for in-depth reporting, and 43% for entertainment; compared with respectively 64%, 10% and 4%, who said the same of CNN. In 2015 The Daily Show's median age of viewership is 36 years old. In 2023 the viewership for age range of 25-54 year olds is 158k and the age range for 18-34 year olds is 30k.Critics chastised Stewart for not conducting sufficiently hard-hitting interviews with his political guests, some of whom he may have lampooned in previous segments. Stewart and other Daily Show writers responded to such criticism by saying that they do not have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians, their only duty is to provide entertainment. Stewart's appearance on the CNN show Crossfire picked up this debate, where he chastised the CNN production and hosts for not conducting informative and current interviews on a news network.In September 2022, Noah announced he would step down as the host of The Daily Show. His last episode as host was on December 8, 2022. As a new permanent host has not been chosen, the show has featured a rotating cast of guest hosts, with Jon Stewart returning to host Monday night shows starting February 12, 2024 and through the fall elections."

        "content": "The host sits at his desk on the elevated island stage in the style of a traditional news show. The show initially used New York PBS station WNET's facilities until late 1998, when it moved a few blocks to NEP Studio 54. The Colbert Report would claim NEP Studio 54 in 2005. On July 11, 2005, the show premiered in its new studio, NEP Studio 52, at 733 11th Avenue, a few blocks west of its former location.\nThe set of the new studio was given a sleeker, more formal look, including a backdrop of three large projection screens. The traditional guests' couch, which had been a part of the set since the show's premiere, was done away with in favor of simple upright chairs. The change was initially not well-received, spawning a backlash among some fans and prompting a \"Bring Back the Couch\" campaign. The campaign was mentioned on subsequent shows by Stewart and supported by Daily Show contributor Bob Wiltfong. The couch was eventually featured in a sweepstakes in which the winner received the couch, round-trip tickets to New York, tickets to the show, and a small sum of money.\nOn April 9, 2007, the show debuted a new set. The projection screens were revamped (with one large screen behind Stewart, while the smaller one behind the interview subject remained the same), a large, global map directly behind Stewart, a more open studio floor, and a J-shaped desk supported at one end by a globe. The intro was also updated; the graphics, display names, dates, and logos were all changed.\nOn September 28, 2015, the show debuted a new set alongside the debut of Trevor Noah's tenure. According to Larry Hartman, Noah took a lot of inspiration from Stewart's set. A second on-stage 'jumbo-tron' was added and the colours of the set were made lighter. The graphics, intro, theme music, lower thirds, logo, etc. were also all revamped. On July 19, 2016, the set and graphics were given another change to reflect Democalypse 2016 and denote The Daily Show's RNC and DNC coverage (which was taped in the conventions' respective cities). The new temporary sets had a Washington theme, and was meant to show that Washington is \"a little broke\" and needs \"repair\". Though the studio was reverted to its former self after the election week in 2016, the changes to the graphics were kept.\nAfter a stretch of episodes filmed from Trevor Noah's apartment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the show returned to a smaller studio at One Astor Plaza, the corporate headquarters of ViacomCBS in Times Square. The new studio had no audience, and a smaller, more intimate atmosphere with muted colors. In April 2022, The Daily Show returned to NEP Studio 52 with a revamped set, combining elements of the Times Square studio with a revamped version of its previous layout."

By lunchtime, Noah \u2014 who describes his role as that of the captain of a team \u2014 has begun to review headline jokes. The script is submitted by 3 pm, and at 4:15 there is a rehearsal.

        "content": "The show's correspondents have two principal roles: experts with satirical senior titles that the main host interviews about certain issues, or hosts of field reporting segments which often involve humorous commentary and interviews relating to a current issue. The current team of correspondents collectively known as \"The World's Fakest News Team\" (formerly known as \"The Best F#@king News Team Ever\") includes Ronny Chieng, Michael Kosta, Desi Lydic, Dulc\u00e9 Sloan, Troy Iwata, and Grace Kuhlenschmidt. Contributors appear on a less frequent basis, often with their own unique recurring segment or topic. Current contributors are Lewis Black and Jordan Klepper. Ben Karlin says that the on-air talent contribute in many ways to the material they perform, playing an integral role in the creation of their field pieces as well as being involved with their scripted studio segments, either taking part early on in the writing process or adding improvised material during the rehearsal.The show has featured a number of well-known comedians throughout its run and is notable for boosting the careers of several of these. In 2006, The Onion editor-in-chief Scott Dikkers described it as a key launching pad for comedic talent, saying that \"I don't know if there's a better show you could put on your resume right now.\" Steve Carell, who was a correspondent between 1999 and 2005 before moving on to a movie career and starring television role in The Office, credits Stewart and The Daily Show with his success. In 2005, the show's longest-serving correspondent, Stephen Colbert, became the host of the spin-off The Colbert Report, earning critical and popular acclaim. Colbert would host the program until he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of CBS's Late Show in 2015. Ed Helms, a former correspondent from 2002 to 2006, also starred on NBC's The Office and was a main character in the 2009 hit The Hangover.After filling in as host during Stewart's two-month absence in the summer of 2013, John Oliver went on to host his own show on HBO, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. In 2016, former correspondent Samantha Bee launched her own late-night talk show Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. Bee's husband Jason Jones, also a former correspondent, serves as executive producer for the show. Hasan Minhaj, the last correspondent hired during Stewart's tenure as host, left the show in 2018 to host Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj on Netflix.In June 2010, actress-comedian Olivia Munn began a tryout period on the show as a correspondent. Her credentials were questioned by Irin Carmon of the website Jezebel, who suggested that Munn was better known as a sex symbol than as a comedian. Carmon's column was denounced by Munn and the Daily Show's female writers, producers, and correspondents, 32 of whom posted a rebuttal on the show's website in which they asserted that the description of the Daily Show office given by the Jezebel piece was not accurate. Munn appeared as a Daily Show correspondent in a total of 16 episodes, from June 2010 to September 2011.Wyatt Cenac had a tumultuous tenure on the show, revealing in a July 2015 interview on WTF with Marc Maron, that his departure stemmed in part from a heated argument he had with Jon Stewart in June 2011 over a bit about Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain. However, Cenac did return for Stewart's final episode to bid him farewell and the two exchanged an intentionally awkward conversation."

It has been airing outside of the U.S. on CNN International and other overseas networks since September 2002. This edition runs for a half-hour and contains a selection of segments, including one guest interview from the preceding week's shows, usually from the Monday or Tuesday episode. Noah provides an exclusive introductory monologue in front of an audience, usually about the week's prevalent international news story, and closing comments without an audience present. When aired on CNN International, the broadcast is prefaced by a written disclaimer: \"The show you are about to watch is a news parody. Its stories are not fact checked. Its reporters are not journalists. And its opinions are not fully thought through.\"Since February 27, 2017, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah has been regularly simulcast on Black Entertainment Television.\nBetween 2001 and 2006, Westwood One broadcast small, ninety-second portions of the show to various radio stations across America.In Canada, The Daily Show was aired on The Comedy Network (a cable channel similar to Comedy Central), in simulcast with the Comedy Central airing, as well as on the CTV broadcast network at 12:05 a.m. local time, following late local newscasts. After the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, The Daily Show has not been shown on any TV channel in Canada.\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, the digital television channel More4 used to broadcast episodes of The Daily Show Tuesday through Friday evenings with the Global Edition, which is uncensored, airing on Mondays; regular episodes air the evening following their U.S. airing. More4 was the first international broadcaster to syndicate entire Daily Show episodes, though they made edits to the program due to content, language, length or commercial references. The program was also available to watch via the internet video on demand service 4oD. However, the 'toss' to The Colbert Report was usually included even though it was aired on FX, another channel. In addition, the placement of commercial breaks followed the UK format, with one break midway through the show rather than several short breaks at various points. When The Daily Show was on hiatus, either re-runs or alternative content were aired. Since January 2011, only the Global Edition is broadcast.\nIn July 2012 Comedy Central announced that The Daily Show would be shown on Comedy Central Extra in the same format as previously on More4, with episodes shown 24 hours after airing in the U.S. The show aired on the channel from July 2012 to April 2015.\nThe Global Edition of the week of July 20, 2011, was not aired in the UK as it included a segment mocking Rupert Murdoch's appearance before the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee in relation to the News International phone hacking scandal. Parliamentary rules ban parliamentary proceedings from being broadcast in a satirical context. Stewart dedicated a segment of the show on August 2, 2011, to lampooning the censorship of the episode in Britain. In May that year, The Daily Show mocked the ban on using footage of the Royal Wedding in a satirical context with an animated video that showed Paddington Bear, Gollum and Adolf Hitler as guests at the wedding, and depicted its attendants engaging in various forms of violent and sexual behavior. Stewart later discussed the ban with guest Keira Knightley.The Daily Show used to be aired in India on Comedy Central India.The Daily Show aired on Australian Pay TV channel, The Comedy Channel, weeknights at 6:30pm. Free-to-air digital channel ABC2 began broadcasting the show without commercial breaks in March 2010, but discontinued in January 2011 when The Comedy Channel obtained exclusive rights; episodes were also available on the network's online service ABC iView shortly after airing. The Comedy Channel (as well as ABC2 during 2010) used to air the show together with The Colbert Report, and both air the Global Edition on Mondays and the regular edition Tuesday through Friday. The Global Edition was previously shown weekend late nights on SBS before moving to Network TEN. The show now airs on 10 Shake (owned by Comedy Central parent ViacomCBS).\nIn North Africa and the Middle East, the Daily Show was broadcast on Showtime Arabia starting in 2008 and ending in 2015. When the show transitioned under Noah, OSN decided to wait a bit before airing the new show. Now, the Global Edition of Noah's show is broadcast on OSN's Comedy Central HD channel. Episodes are often edited if they contain topics deemed inappropriate for the region.\nEpisodes of the U.S. version are also available online the next day at Comedy Central's official Daily Show website, although this service is not available in all countries. However, clips for UK and Ireland viewers became available on the UK Comedy Central website in December 2011."

As Arthur Wallace writes: \"As a literary composition for chorus dithyramb was the creation of Arion of Corinth,\" His fame was established in antiquity, and Herodotus says \"Arion was second to none of the lyre-players in his time and was also the first man we know of to compose and name the dithyramb and teach it in Corinth\". However, J. H. Sleeman observes of the dithyramb, or circular chorus, \"It is first mentioned by Archilochus (c. 665 BC) ... Arion flourished at least 50 years later ... probably gave it a more artistic form, adding a chorus of 50 people, personating satyrs... who danced around an altar of Dionysus. He was doubtless the first to introduce the dithyramb into Corinth\". Armand D'Angour notes that Arion's contribution to the reform of the dithyramb, which was eventually performed in a circle and called kuklios choros, was recognised by ancient sources by the fact that they named his father Kukleus (\"Circle-man\").Arion is also associated with the origins of tragedy: of Solon John the Deacon reports: \u201cArion of Methymna first introduced the drama [i.e. action] of tragedy, as Solon indicated in his poem entitled Elegies\"."

        "content": "According to Herodotus' account of the Lydian empire under the Mermnads, Arion attended a musical competition in Sicily, which he won. On his return trip from Tarentum, whose onomastic founder has a similar story, avaricious sailors plotted to kill Arion and steal the rich prizes he carried home. Arion was given the choice of suicide with a proper burial on land, or being thrown in the sea to perish. He asked for permission to sing a last song to win time.\n\nPlaying his kithara, Arion sang a praise to Apollo, the god of poetry, and his song attracted a number of dolphins around the ship.  Some argue that the dolphins were sent by Apollo to rescue Arion. At the end of the song, Arion threw himself into the sea rather than be killed, but one of the dolphins saved his life and carried him to safety at the sanctuary of Poseidon at Cape Tainaron. When he reached land, being eager for his journey, he failed to return the dolphin to the sea and it perished there. He told his misfortunes to Periander, the Tyrant of Corinth, who ordered the dolphin to be buried, and monument raised to it. Shortly after, word came to Periander that the ship on which Arion had sailed had been brought to Corinth by a storm. He ordered the crew to be led before him, and inquired about Arion, but they replied that he had died and that they had buried him. The tyrant replied: \"Tomorrow you will swear to that at the Dolphin's monument.\" Because of this he ordered them to be kept under guard, and instructed Arion to hide in the dolphin's monument the next morning, attired as he had been when he had thrown himself into the sea. When the tyrant brought the ship's crew to the dolphin's monument and ordered them to swear by the departed spirit of the dolphin that Arion was dead, Arion came out of the monument. In amazement, wondering by what divinity he had been saved, the ship's crew was silent. The tyrant ordered them to be crucified at the dolphin's monument. Apollo, because of Arion's skill with the kithara, placed him and the dolphin among the stars. This dolphin was catasterised as the constellation Delphinus, by the blessing of Apollo.\n\nThe story as Herodotus tells it was taken up in other literature. Lucian of Samosata wittily imagined the dialogue between Poseidon and the very dolphin who bore Arion.Augustine of Hippo asserted that pagans \"believed in what they read in their own books\" and took Arion to be a historical individual. \"There is no historicity in this tale\", according to Eunice Burr Stebbins, Arion and the dolphins are given as an example of \"a folkloristic motif especially associated with Apollo\" by Irad Malkin. Erasmus instanced Arion as one of the traditional poet's topics that sound like historia rather than fabulae, though he misremembered that Augustine had taken the Arion story to be historical."

L\u00e9vy's 1995 book, Qu'est-ce que le virtuel?

        "content": "L\u00e9vy was born in Tunisia, to a Sephardic Jewish family, before moving to France. He is one of the major philosophers working on the implications of cyberspace and digital communications. L\u00e9vy has written a dozen of books that have been translated in more than 12 languages and are studied in many universities all over the world. His principal work, published in French in 1994 and translated into English, is entitled Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace.As early as 1990 L\u00e9vy published a book about the merging of digital networks and hypertextual communication. L\u00e9vy's theory of knowledge spaces and the cosmopedia foreshadowed the emergence of Wikipedia and anticipates wikinomics, and the efficacy of shared distributed knowledge systems.From 1993 to 1998 L\u00e9vy was Professor at the University of Paris VIII, where he studied the concept of collective intelligence and knowledge-based societies. He has contributed to many scholarly discourses about cyberculture.He was a member of the editorial board of the Revue virtuelle project of the Pompidou Centre in Paris from 1995 to 1997 and was the author of a report on cyberculture for the Council of Europe in 1996.In the chapter Interactivity from his book Cyberculture (2001), L\u00e9vy argues that analogue communication (telephone, mail) differs from digital communication (email, chat) in terms of temporal organization and material involvement of their communication systems. He claims that interactivity is a vague term that \"has more to do with finding the solution to a problem, the need to develop new ways to observe, design, and evaluate methods of communication, than it does with identifying a simple, unique characteristic that can be assigned to a given system\". Henry Jenkins, among others, cites him as an important influence on theories of online collective intelligence.In Becoming Virtual: Reality in the Digital Age L\u00e9vy explores the way we virtualise every aspect of our lives, from real time (media) interaction through language, to our actions through technology, and our social relations through institutions. And in each case the mechanism is the same: we create some artifact, more or less material, which allows us to shift what's at stake away from the immediate here-and-now and towards a problematic where new possibilities open up."

She now lives in Hailey, Idaho, with her husband Bob, a hunter/jumper and trainer. Debbie trains and teaches riders on Peggy and E. Parry Thomas's River Grove Farm in Sun Valley, Idaho.\nMcDonald's first mount was an $800 pony. She agreed that she would pay for board if her parents bought it for her. Shortly thereafter Debbie managed to find a gaited horse trainer near her hometown who allowed her to groom horses and clean stalls in exchange for board.  At age 14,  when Debbie went to turn her pony out, she discovered a strange man in his stall, beating him. She went running for help and ran into a young trainer and her future husband, Bob McDonald, who ran a hunter/jumper farm and hired her as a stable hand.  It was at this facility that she began her career.McDonald began her career in show jumping. However, she switched to dressage after a serious fall in which her horse somersaulted over her breaking ribs, rupturing her spleen, and fracturing a vertebra in her neck,   She first met Parry and Peggy Thomas when she got a catch ride at a dressage show in Las Vegas on one of their horses whose rider was not available.The Thomases also became the owners of Brentina, a chestnut Hanoverian mare that became McDonald's primary mount. McDonald and her husband obtained the mare at an auction in Germany in 1994.  Brentina, foaled in 1991, had a suitable temperament to respect McDonald, who is only five feet tall, and the team established a partnership that took them to the Olympics. McDonald and Brentina began by winning the Individual and Team Gold medals at the 1999 Pan American Games.  In recognition of this accomplishment, McDonald was named the 1999 Equestrian of the Year by the United States Equestrian Federation and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) Female Equestrian Athlete of the Year.   In 2003, McDonald become the first American rider to win the Dressage World Cup, and the pair placed third at the 2005 World Cup. As members of the United States Equestrian Team they won a team silver and team bronze at the 2002 and 2006 World Equestrian Games.  At the 2004 Athens Olympics, the pair won the team bronze and were individually fourth overall, and McDonald was dubbed  \"First Lady of American Dressage.\"Brentina was named the 2005 Farnam/Platform USEF Horse of the Year. After the 2008 Olympics, where the mare had an uncharacteristically poor performance, she was retired to the Thomas' farm. While McDonald went on to compete with other horses, Brentina developed an impaction in early 2009 and underwent colic surgery to remove a fecalith from her small colon.  She has since recovered and attended a retirement ceremony at the 2009 FEI World Cup Dressage Finals in Las Vegas.On January 22, 2010 McDonald was named the U.S. Equestrian Federation's Developing Dressage Coach, a role designed to identify and cultivate future US Dressage stars."

He later led a consortium of investors who leased the theatre during a much longer second phase, after the property was revived by Richard Burbage and Cuthbert Burbage.\nTheatre historian David Grote describes Evans as an \"unsavoury\" and \"devious\" character who was not above kidnapping young boys to perform in his theatre."

This was part of a complicated series of transactions apparently designed to ensure that the building could continue to be used as a theatre, something More was attempting to stop. Evans seems to have been working in alliance with John Lyly and his patron Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. In 1584 More regained control of the building and stopped performances.In 1585 Evans was head of the Earl of Oxford's Boys at court.It has been suggested that during this period Evans may have written the play the Famous Victories of Henry V, one of the principal models for Shakespeare's later plays on the life of Henry.

This helped the Burbages out of a problem, since after their father acquired it in 1596 wealthy local citizens had successfully petitioned to stop the building being used again as a theatre. In consequence, it had been left empty for several years. Evans intended to use it to support a company of boys, as he had before 1590. By installing child \"choristers\", and setting aside part of building for their education, Evans could claim that the theatre was legally a school: one in which plays happened to be performed. Evans apparently supplemented his choristers by taking talented children from local grammar schools, which he could do because his business partner Nathaniel Giles, Hunnis's successor at the Chapel Royal, had a warrant to provide performers for the queen's entertainment. In 1600 the father of one child attempted to sue Evans for forcing his son to join the Blackfriars troupe.\nBy April 1602 the business appears to have been in financial difficulty. Evans accepted a deal that he had backed out of a few months earlier, ceding half ownership of the company to three new partners, William Rastell, Edward Kirkham and Thomas Kendall. In return he received an injection of capital. When the plague struck in the following year, Evans tried to give up the lease, but the Burbages refused to release him from the contract. He later ceded the remaining half ownership to three more partners, John Marston, William Strachey and his own wife.\nThe company was later badly affected when in 1608 the French ambassador Antoine Lef\u00e8vre de la Boderie complained to King James I about productions of plays by George Chapman at Blackfriars in which the French court was allegedly treated with disrespect. The ambassador told James that there had also been a play about a Scottish mine in which James himself was portrayed as a drunk. Incensed, James ordered that the Blackfriars children should \"never play more, but should first begg their bread\". Evans was forced to turn the lease back to the Burbages later in 1608. They took it up for their own company, the King's Men. The deal involved Henry's relative Thomas Evans taking one share in the new partnership, the other six going to members of the King's Men, including the Burbages and Shakespeare.\nThe transfer of the share to Thomas may have been related to the fact that after the end of the lease two of Evans' old partners engaged in a protracted lawsuit to recover money from him on the grounds that he had breached the agreement with them. Henry himself is listed as the sharer in later cases in 1610 and 1612."

        "content": "In addition to his possible authorship of the Famous Victories Evans had an indirect influence on Shakespearean drama. His company of boys has often been seen as a rival to the King's Men, in part because of the apparent attacks on it in Hamlet. However, income from the 1599 lease helped to keep the Globe theatre afloat at a time when takings were limited and the Burbages were having to make hefty repayments on the loans they had taken out to build and maintain it. The Burbages appear to have trusted Evans despite the fact that the historical record indicates that he \"was devious or incompetent even by Elizabethan standards\". When Evans finally gave up the lease, and the King's Men moved into Blackfriars, Shakespeare's plays start to undergo significant changes in their structure and style, apparently adapting to the new, more select, audience and the indoor theatre."

During this period this team made significant contributions to psychiatry. The three main contributions are described below: \nFirst.  They have scientifically proven that depressions require different treatments depending on the specific type of depression, against the current trend driven by American psychiatry, and some psychiatrists in Spain. This trend does not distinguish differential treatment in all cases depression in the same manner and with the same drugs. They believe that it must be treated very differently the depressions of biological cause (endogenous) from depressions of psychological or social causes (neurotic or reactive).  Thus at the time defended the use of old tricyclics and MAOIs in atypical depression and endogenous, and now they prefer dual-action antidepressants in endogenous depression and antidepressant action of specific the neurotic or reactive depression (serotonin).\nSecond.  They are critical of the excessive overvaluation of comorbidity (at least two different diseases in one patient) in psychiatry, which involves the therapist to make several different diagnostic and patient follow several different treatments. For this reason they identify the primary underlying pathology and treat it specifically. They tend to assess and treat a single disease and not a mixture of pathologies. \nThird.  They delved into the study and diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in line to differentiate this disease from others like: hair pulling (trichotillomania), fear of body deformation (BDD), etc. These conditions that resemble OCD reiteration, not genuine obsessions and, therefore, treatment should be different. This team has made numerous scientific publications in this field."

His earliest compositions in the medium, e.g. \"Chef d'Oeuvre\" and \"Newark Airport Rock\" (1967) attracted attention because they established a new tradition some have called programmatic electronic music. In 1970, he won Guggenheim, Fulbright and American-Scandinavian Foundation fellowships. When he was twenty-eight years old, he joined the faculty of Dartmouth College where he established one of the first electronic music studios in the United States. He remained there intermittently for forty-two years. In the mid-1970s, he left Dartmouth to briefly become the head of Elektronmusikstudion (EMS) (sv) in Stockholm, Sweden. In the late 1970s, together with Sydney Alonso and Cameron Jones, he helped develop the first commercial digital synthesizer called the Synclavier. For a decade he toured around the United States and Europe performing the compositions he composed for this instrument. In the early 1990s, he helped found the Theremin Center for Electronic Music at the Moscow Conservatory of Music. He also taught at Keio University (Mita) in Tokyo, Japan, CCRMA at Stanford University and the University of California Santa Cruz. In his later years, he devoted most of his time to the composition of instrumental and choral music in a quasi-Romantic vein which has largely been performed only in France, Russia and Japan."

His mother was employed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and his father by Twentieth Century Fox film studios. His father left his family the year Appleton was born and he spent his first years in Mrs. Bell's (an orphanage) and with his brother (Michael Charles Appleton, born 1932) at Palomar Military Academy. When he was six years old his mother married Alexander \"Sasha\" Walden (born in Ufa, Russia, in 1897), a double-bass player in the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra. He was the greatest musical influence in Appleton's young life seeing that he studied piano, encouraging him to compose music and taking him to multiple concerts. Appleton's parents were true believers in the Soviet Union and active members of the multiple left-wing organizations including the Communist party. In the 1950s both his parents were blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee and lost their jobs. As a child Appleton studied piano with Jacob Gimpel and Theodore Saidenberg but preferred composing his own music rather than playing the works assigned to him (e.g. Chopin, Scarlatti, Prokofiev).

        "content": "Kohn was born in Manhattan, attended Columbia University, and spent four years at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, from 1891 through 1895.  After brief stints for other architects, he established an independent practice in 1896.  In 1905 he married sculptor Estelle Rumbold of St. Louis, Missouri.\nHis first building of note was the Vienna Sezession-detailed Old New York Evening Post Building (1906\u201307), 20 Vesey Street, one of the limited number of Art Nouveau structures in New York.  Stacks of convex copper-framed windows press forward between unrelieved limestone piers.  Of the four sculpted figures in the uppermost floors, two are by Kohn's wife, and the other two are by Gutzon Borglum.  \nHe designed the hall for the Society for Ethical Culture (Central Park West and 64th Street, 1911) and had formerly collaborated with Carr\u00e8re and Hastings on the adjoining Ethical Culture school building (1902).  \"Like Christian Science, the Ethical Culture movement was searching for its own form - it had no historic precedents from which to draw. Kohn's exterior, all Bedford limestone, took its cornice and base course lines from the adjacent school, but nothing else. Instead of the school's broad window facing Central Park, the meeting house has wide, limestone expanses, like a mausoleum, and simply, blocky detailing.\" (Stern et al.) \nHe worked in association with his brother, Victor H. Kohn,  who died in New York, 4 May 1910, aged thirty-eight. In 1918 he was a founding member of the Technical Alliance, organized for the purpose of undertaking an energy survey of North America, for the reconsideration of the workings of the entire social system; their work was continued by Technocracy Inc.\nFrom 1917 through the early 1950s Kohn collaborated, formally and informally, with fellow architect Charles Butler. In the 1920s they became well known for their temples and other structures for the Reform Jewish congregations of New York, notably the discreetly modernist Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York on Fifth Avenue (1927\u201329)  and for the New York Society for Ethical Culture, of which he had been a member since early youth. The Congregation Emanuel-El blends a conservative modernism with Neo-Romanesque precedents, stripped of its literal historicisms. The west end of Emanu-El, facing Central Park, is a single vastly-scaled entrance porch, infilled with stained glass under a round-headed arch. Buttressed wall permit an interior free of support, with a roof 103 feet above the floor.  In 1953 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician.\nAnother regular partner was Clarence Stein.  Like Stein, in the 1930s and beyond Kohn would become recognized for his expertise in low-cost housing.  Kohn also became President of the American Institute of Architects in 1930\u201332."

Receiving a degree in law, he tried life as a courtier in Spain and Florence, without any great success.  Cortese apparently had some success in the Medici court as he was sent in 1599 to Spain as a member of a Medici delegation for the marriage of Philip III of Spain with Margherita of Austria.  In his \"Tuscan\" rhymes there is a fruitless attempt to catch the attention of the Counts of Lemos, the foremost representatives of the Spanish crown in Naples.\nHe was a close friend of Luigi Caponaro, who he frequently cites in his work.\nRegardless of his commemoration by Basile in 1627, it is generally believed, due to several handwritten manuscripts, that Cortese lived at least until 1640 and it is consequently believed that he attended and perhaps participated in his own funeral.  \nCortese is very important for Baroque and dialectical literature, in that, with Basile, he laid the foundations for the artistic and literary dignity of the Neapolitan language as opposed to the Tuscan dialect in which Cortese had also produced a number of largely laudatory works."

In 1976, Cousens legally changed his name from Kenneth Gabriel Cousens to Gabriel. Cousens advocates live foods therapy, a nutritional regimen which he says can cure diabetes, depression and other chronic degenerative diseases. He is the founder of the \"Essene Order of Light\", a spiritual organization based upon teachings from the Jewish Kabbalah, the Torah, and modern interpretations of the Essenes. The Essenes are a mystical group from the second century B.C.E. who lived in community, eschewed materialism and grew their own food. The modern Essene movement was founded by Edmond Bordeaux Szekely, a religious scholar who promoted a simple holistic lifestyle of meditation and raw vegan eating and published several books on the Essenes in the early 20th century. Essene Order of Light is taught by Cousens at \"Tree of Life Foundation,\" an organization directed by Cousens and headquartered at its \"Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center\" in Patagonia, Arizona. Cousens has authored nine books and tours internationally promoting his ideas on food and his spiritual beliefs."

Cousens founded a not for profit organization called the Essene Order of Light which teaches \"modern Essene living\". He outlined his philosophy in his book Creating Peace By Being Peace.Cousens has advocated a raw food diet for babies and children. He instituted a study of the medical history of infants and children and advocates for raw food education. A 2009 documentary, Simply Raw, followed six people with diabetes who go through a thirty-day raw vegan program in an attempt to cure their disease with a raw food diet and without drugs.

In consequence of the California decision, New York also required him to return his license. Cousens' license in California was later reinstated, but not in New York. Because of this, he is not eligible for a medical license in Arizona.In 1998, 57-year-old Charles Levy of New Jersey died after being treated at the center over a five-day period. The cause of death was determined by the Santa Cruz County Medical Examiner, who along with the Arizona Medical Board attributed the death to a gas gangrene infection caused by \"bovine adrenal fluid\" injections given by Cousens as part of a treatment for fatigue. The autopsy also found that Levy had hepatitis, encephalomyelitis, and coronary atherosclerosis. Levy's son said that his father was healthy, able to run three miles, not overweight, and had no high blood pressure at the time of his visit to the spa, and the family sued for malpractice. Cousens settled the suit for an undisclosed amount paid to the family. The case came up before the Arizona Board of Homeopathic Medical Examiners in 2001. Despite the medical examiner's report and testimony, then Board Chairman Bruce Shelton said he \"found no medical fault with Dr. Cousens' care of\" Levy and the board found \"no violation of homeopathic law\" in Cousens' treatment. Cousens argued that the medical examiner had misdiagnosed the cause of death, which he said was toxic shock unrelated to the injections, a claim that the Levy family attorney called \"outrageous\"."

The following year, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was ordered to Washington, D.C., where he fulfilled his military service obligations as a staff arranger and rehearsal conductor at the Navy School of Music. Upon his honorable discharge in late 1957 - followed by a brief teaching assignment at Morton College in his hometown of Cicero - Tyra joined the Louisiana State University faculty in the Fall of 1958, serving as an assistant to the Director of Bands L. Bruce Jones. In 1959, LSU elevated Tyra to the position of 14th Bandmaster of the Tiger Marching Band, making him - at age 26 - the nation's youngest director of a major university marching band.That same year Tyra created the LSU Ballet Corps dance line, launching what would in 1965, become the LSU Golden Girls. Satisfying the constant demand for new musical content on the LSU gridiron was a small cadre of aspiring student composers and arrangers which included Bill Conti. Conti would later gain fame by penning Gonna Fly Now, the theme song popularized by the 1976 hit film Rocky. During his tenure, Tyra introduced Hey, Fightin' Tigers, an adaptation of Hey, Look Me Over from the 1960 musical Wildcat! by Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh. This team spirit song - later adopted by the LSU Golden Girls as their introductory theme - continues to be used at LSU athletic events today.\nIn 1964, Tyra was appointed Director of Bands at Eastern Michigan University. In 1968, a young Max Plank joined the EMU Bands Program as Tyra's assistant. Together they forged a lifelong collaboration and friendship that would result in significant growth of the EMU's band program and its traditions. In 2002, Plank passed the leadership mantle to Scott Boerma, ending an era that spanned over 38 years of EMU Band history. After leaving EMU in 1977 and until 1985, Tyra headed the Department of Music at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina, strengthening its Music Education curriculum and planting the seeds of growth for its instrumental performance programs, including marching band. From 1985 until his retirement in 1989, he served as Professor and Dean of the Crane School of Music at SUNY-Potsdam.He also held appointments as Director of the Ann Arbor Civic Band (late 1960s to 1977) and guest Clinician at the Ontario Youth Music Camp in Beaverton, Ontario, Canada (1970\u201373).\nTyra was a member of the Iota Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia at Northwestern University, the Kappa Kappa Psi/Tau Beta Sigma band service organization and served as \u039a\u039a\u03a8's National President from 1973 to 1975.

Compositions and arrangements for intermediate bands include Two 17th Century Italian Songs and arrangements of Handel's The Messiah (Part I)  and \"I'd Do Anything\" from the Lionel Bart musical Oliver!. His Two Gaelic Folk Songs (1964) - an arrangement of the two Irish patriotic tunes Molly Malone and Wearing of the Green in the 20th-century classical music idiom - remains in the standard repertoire for many intermediate band programs. A third Gaelic tune, The Minstrel Boy, was also arranged by Tyra and originally intended to round out this collection. Never published, it is now part of the Music Department archives at Eastern Michigan University.\nFor more skilled ensembles, he penned many arrangements of pre-game and half-time music for the Northwestern, LSU and EMU Marching Bands, including nationally televised works performed by the Tiger Marching Band when LSU competed post-season at the Sugar Bowl (1959, 1960), the Orange Bowl (1962), the Cotton Bowl Classic (1963) and the Bluebonnet Bowl (1964). His original compositions include Suite for Brass and Timpani, Three Christmas Miniatures, Ceremonial Sketch and Intravention. For Eastern Michigan University, Tyra composed Eastern Variants, the music and lyrics for Go Green!,  The Pride of the Peninsula, Huron War Cry, EMU Fanfare and the break strain for the Huron (now Eagle) Fight Song on YouTube. These compositions - integral to modern EMU band tradition - reflect the expertise he developed in writing for low brass voices while serving at the U.S. Navy School of Music."

He created the Collegium Musicum there, developing his interest in Renaissance and Baroque music, later expanding his activities to include the Classical and early Romantic eras. He is now in demand as a fortepianist in concert halls across Europe, where he is known for his refined sensitivity to the rhetorical aspects of music and for his skills in improvisation. (His cadenzas were singled out in reviews of his Beethoven concerto recordings.) Over the years, he has acquired a unique collection of period keyboard instruments, which travel with him for concerts and CD recordings.\nIn 1977, he attracted international attention when he conducted Monteverdi's L'Orfeo in the former Royal Flemish Opera House in Antwerp. This series of 18 performances established a new standard which remains to this day.\nFrom 1980 to 1985, he was the artistic director of the Sweelinck Conservatory of Amsterdam.\nIn 1987 Van Immerseel established the \"period instrument\" ensemble Anima Eterna, which he continues to lead. This ensemble has become well-known and achieved a world-wide reputation particularly for the CD series of Mozart's complete piano concerti (with van Immerseel as soloist and conductor).\nDuring 1999 they toured Europe with performances of Beethoven symphonies.\nIn addition to his concertising, Van Immerseel is professor at the Antwerp Conservatory, where he uses historical instruments from the nearby Vleeshuis Museum to give masterclasses. He has also taught at the Sweelinck Conservatorium in Amsterdam and the Conservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur in Paris, as well as given masterclasses at festivals in La Roque-d'Anth\u00e9ron, Utrecht, Sopron and Ancona.\nVan Immerseel appears on Sony Classical's Vivarte imprint as a solo performer, as a soloist with Tafelmusik and as a participant in chamber music. Among his partners were: Midori Seiler (violin), Claire Chevallier (piano duo), Lisa Shklyaver (clarinet), Thomas Bauer (baritone), Yeree Suh (soprano), and Chouchane Siranossian (violin).\nSince winning first prize at the inaugural Paris International Harpsichord Competition in 1973, Jos Van Immerseel has established an international career as a fortepianist and conductor specializing in music of the Baroque and Classical eras. Accomplished on the organ and piano as well as harpsichord and fortepiano, Van Immerseel has in particular gained a reputation for his performances of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert on Sony Classical. Most recently he has appeared on Vivarte with Anner Bylsma in performances of Beethoven's complete cello sonatas (S2K 60761) and with L'Archibudelli in performances of Schubert's \"Trout\" Quintet and \"Arpeggione\" Sonata (SK 63361). His recent cycle of Beethoven Piano concertos with Tafelmusik and Bruno Weil (Nos. 1 and 2: SK 68250; Nos. 3 and 4: SK 62824; No. 5: SK 63365) elicited praise for his stylistic sensitivity and his musical sensibility. His recording of Mozart's late piano works, Mozart: The Vienna Years (S2K 62879), prompted Classic CD to write that Van Immerseel is \"among the most winning and authoritative champions of the fortepiano\".\nSince 2002 he has been artistic director of the Collection Anima Eterna for the Parisian label Zig-Zag Territories.\nIn 2010, the city of Bremen awarded him the Prize of the Musikfest Bremen for his career."

He had numerous acquaintances amongst vehicle design engineers, especially in Japan at Honda and Mazda and also worked as a consultant to automobile manufacturers. He also had the opportunity to test numerous road and racing cars as a journalist, one of the highlights being the Audi R8 which he tested and demonstrated during a break in the proceedings of the Test Day of the 2003 24 Hours of Le Mans.

He would go on to photograph such people as, Sylvester Stallone, Ronald Reagan, Sidney Sheldon, Lee Remick, Paul McCartney, Peter Criss, Bruce Lee, Todd Rundgren, Priscilla Presley, Pia Zadora, Michael Landon, Florence Henderson, Shelly Fabares, among others.While watching an on-location filming of Charlie's Angels, Fong saw for the first time an on-set Storyboard and reasoned that wedding photography albums should use a similar format to depict a wedding story.  So, using sequential photo layouts rather than static, posed images, Fong introduced the \"Storybook Concept\".  This style of wedding albums remains popular to this day.Here Comes the Guide, a respected \"bible\" of wedding planning has said, \"Every once in a while someone comes along to revolutionize an art form; for wedding photography, that someone Is Gary Fong.\"\nFong was selected in the telecast, Weddings 2000 as one of the top ten wedding photographers in the world.

From that point, Fong gave up trying to meet or achieve goals, and dropped out of society.  It was during this period when he went to Club Med in the Bahamas to vanish, that his greatest inspiration came in the form of maintaining emptiness in not only his schedule but in his aspirations.\nThis began an awareness of a mindset which Fong calls, \"The Law Of Repulsion\".  In the book and interviews, he theorizes that much of what sabotages a person from success is trying \"too hard\" to achieve a narrowly focused goal.  He lists among the examples of the \"Power Of Repulsion\", couples who want badly to have children that have better luck becoming pregnant after adopting, or how a salesman with a quota in mind can become more repulsive to closing a sale than if the goal was not so heavily focused upon.One review described that Fong's approach caused his wealth \"to grow only after he stopped focusing on a set goal for success\". Fong's seemingly random path to a diversified portfolio of business interests came as he \"cast his fate to the wind to free himself and let life lead his path\"."

The property was the site of a former plantation that had been in his family for generations until it was sold during the Great Depression. He was surprised to discover that riprap along the river shore contained cemetery headstones. Research by Virginia historians discovered that the markers were from Columbian Harmony Cemetery, a historic African-American burial ground in Washington, D.C., that was established in 1859 by the first burial society for free Blacks. It was in active use until 1959, then dug up and relocated in 1960. Approximately 37,000 bodies were reburied at National Harmony Memorial Park in Maryland, but the headstones were sold as scrap, including use in riprap. A nonprofit organization was formed to reclaim the gravestones, and as many as possible will be given to National Harmony. Stuart said he will work to create a parklike memorial along the Potomac to recognize any headstones that cannot be reclaimed."

        "content": "Cann was elected president of the local branch of the Amalgamated Miners' Association (AMA) in early 1890, defeating the more radical previous president, Richard Sleath. When the AMA formed a local branch of the Labor Electoral League in 1891 Cann was preselected as candidate for the state parliament seat of Sturt and elected in the same year. Cann was elected unopposed as the sitting member, Wyman Brown, decided to retire after local unions passed a motion of no confidence in him. Other labour candidates including Sleath (then serving as AMA secretary) and William Ferguson (supported by the Barrier Ranges Trades and Labour Council) withdrew from the contest once it was clear Cann had the majority support of local unions.Cann faced significant local problems once elected. The far west of New South Wales was in a severe drought, and Broken Hill had no secure source of fresh water. Cann was able to persuade the Premier, Henry Parkes, to commission emergency supplies of water brought in from South Australia by train.An even more significant problem emerged with the defeat of the local union movement in the 1892 miners' strike. The 18-week strike saw local union leaders arrested and imprisoned in Sydney and strikebreakers brought in to replace striking miners. Union membership collapsed following the defeat and many of the working conditions won in previous years were lost.While the defeat of the strike was a significant setback for the unions in Broken Hill, politically Labour was very successful in the 1890s. Cann was able to persuade the Dibbs government to divide the district of Sturt into three new seats, Alma, Broken Hill and a redrawn Sturt. Labour polled over 70 percent in all three new seats at the 1894 election, with Cann winning Broken Hill.Cann served as Labor's central campaign director for the 1897 election to the Federation Convention. Labor opposed the 1897 federation proposal, instead advocating a unicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage. This opposition to federation was controversial locally, and although the \"No\" vote was successful, it caused significant internal conflict within the Labor party in the far west. When Labor won the 1910 election, Cann was elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. Cann resigned as speaker as part of the political crisis caused by the resignations of Bill Dunn and Henry Horne, causing Labor to lose its majority. Parliament was porouged and on its resumption, Liberal Reform member Henry Willis was elected speaker and restoring Labor's majority.Cann continued to serve as MLA for Broken Hill until the seat was abolished in 1913, when he returned to the seat of Sturt. From 1912 to 1914 he was the Treasurer of New South Wales. In 1916 Cann was expelled from the Labor Party during the 1916 Labor split, and resigned to take the position of deputy chief commissioner of the New South Wales Government Railways. He was succeeded as the member for Sturt by the more radical Percy Brookfield.In 1914 his younger brother George joined him in the legislative Assembly, winning the 1914 Canterbury state by-election.\n\n\n== References =="

He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, and, after the war, was educated at Harvard University, where he excelled academically. He later became a professor of government at the university and earned an international reputation as an expert on nuclear weapons and foreign policy. He frequently acted as a consultant to government agencies, think tanks, and the presidential campaigns of Nelson Rockefeller and Richard Nixon before being appointed national security advisor.\nKissinger pioneered the policy of d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union, orchestrated an opening of relations with China, engaged in \"shuttle diplomacy\" in the Middle East to end the Yom Kippur War, and negotiated the Paris Peace Accords, which ended American involvement in the Vietnam War. For his role in negotiating the end of the Vietnam War, he was awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize under controversial circumstances. A practitioner of a pragmatic approach to politics called Realpolitik, he has been widely considered by scholars to have been an effective secretary of state.Kissinger is also associated with controversial U.S. policies, including its bombing of Cambodia, involvement in the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat, support for Argentina's military junta in its Dirty War, support for Indonesia in its invasion of East Timor, and support for Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War and Bangladesh genocide. He was accused of war crimes for the civilian death toll of the policies he pursued, his role in facilitating U.S. support for dictatorial regimes, and willful ignorance towards human rights abuses committed by the United States and its allies.After leaving government, Kissinger founded Kissinger Associates, an international geopolitical consulting firm. He authored over a dozen books on diplomatic history and international relations. His advice was sought by American presidents of both political parties."

        "content": "Kissinger was born Heinz Alfred Kissinger on May 27, 1923, in F\u00fcrth, Bavaria, Germany. He was the son of homemaker Paula (n\u00e9e Stern; 1901\u20131998), from Leutershausen, and Louis Kissinger (1887\u20131982), a schoolteacher. He had a younger brother, Walter (1924\u20132021), who was a businessman. Kissinger's family was German-Jewish. His great-great-grandfather Meyer L\u00f6b adopted \"Kissinger\" as his surname in 1817, taking it from the Bavarian spa town of Bad Kissingen. In his childhood, Kissinger enjoyed playing soccer. He played for the youth team of SpVgg F\u00fcrth, which was one of the nation's best clubs at the time.In a 2022 BBC interview, Kissinger vividly recalled being nine years old in 1933 and learning of Adolf Hitler's election as Chancellor of Germany, which proved to be a profound turning point for the Kissinger family. During Nazi rule, Kissinger and his friends were regularly harassed and beaten by Hitler Youth gangs. Kissinger sometimes defied the segregation imposed by Nazi racial laws by sneaking into soccer stadiums to watch matches, often resulting in beatings from security guards. As a result of the Nazis' anti-Semitic laws, Kissinger was unable to gain admittance to the Gymnasium and his father was dismissed from his teaching job.On August 20, 1938, when Kissinger was 15 years old, he and his family fled Germany to avoid further Nazi persecution. The family briefly stopped in London before arriving in New York City on September 5. Kissinger later downplayed the influence his experiences of Nazi persecution had had on his policies, writing that the \"Germany of my youth had a great deal of order and very little justice; it was not the sort of place likely to inspire devotion to order in the abstract.\" Nevertheless, many scholars, including Kissinger's biographer Walter Isaacson, have argued that his experiences influenced the formation of his realist approach to foreign policy.Kissinger spent his high-school years in the German-Jewish community in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. Although Kissinger assimilated quickly into American culture, he never lost his pronounced German accent, due to childhood shyness that made him hesitant to speak. After his first year at George Washington High School, he began attending school at night while working in a shaving brush factory during the day.Following high school, Kissinger studied accounting at the City College of New York, excelling academically as a part-time student while continuing to work. His studies were interrupted in early 1943, when he was drafted into the U.S. Army."

        "content": "Kissinger earned his Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa in political science from Harvard College in 1950, where he lived in Adams House and studied under William Yandell Elliott. His senior undergraduate thesis, titled The Meaning of History: Reflections on Spengler, Toynbee and Kant, was over 400 pages long, and was the origin of the current limit on length (35,000 words). He earned his Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy at Harvard University in 1951 and 1954, respectively. In 1952, while still a graduate student at Harvard, he served as a consultant to the director of the Psychological Strategy Board, and founded a magazine, Confluence. At that time, he sought to work as a spy for the FBI.\nKissinger's doctoral dissertation was titled Peace, Legitimacy, and the Equilibrium (A Study of the Statesmanship of Castlereagh and Metternich). Stephen Graubard, Kissinger's friend, asserted that Kissinger primarily pursued such endeavor to instruct himself on the history of power play between European states in the 19th century. In his doctoral dissertation, Kissinger first introduced the concept of \"legitimacy\", which he defined as: \"Legitimacy as used here should not be confused with justice. It means no more than an international agreement about the nature of workable arrangements and about the permissible aims and methods of foreign policy\". An international order accepted by all of the major powers is \"legitimate\" whereas an international order not accepted by one or more of the great powers is \"revolutionary\" and hence dangerous. Thus, when after the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the leaders of Britain, France, Austria, Prussia, and Russia agreed to co-operate in the Concert of Europe to preserve the peace after Austria, Prussia, and Russia participated in a series of three Partitions of Poland, in Kissinger's viewpoint this international system was \"legitimate\" because it was accepted by the leaders of all five of the Great Powers of Europe. Notably, Kissinger's Primat der Au\u00dfenpolitik (Primacy of foreign policy) approach to diplomacy took it for granted that as long as the decision-makers in the major states were willing to accept the international order, then it is \"legitimate\" with questions of public opinion and morality dismissed as irrelevant. His dissertation also won him the Senator Charles Sumner Prize, an award given to the best dissertation \"from the legal, political, historical, economic, social, or ethnic approach, dealing with any means or measures tending toward the prevention of war and the establishment of universal peace\" by a student under the Harvard Department of Government. It was published in 1957 as A World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh and the Problems of Peace 1812\u20131822.Kissinger remained at Harvard as a member of the faculty in the Department of Government where he served as the director of the Harvard International Seminar between 1951 and 1971. In 1955, he was a consultant to the National Security Council's Operations Coordinating Board. During 1955 and 1956, he was also study director in nuclear weapons and foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. He released his book Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy the following year. The book, which criticized the Eisenhower administration's massive retaliation nuclear doctrine, caused much controversy at the time by proposing the use of tactical nuclear weapons on a regular basis to win wars. That same year, he published A World Restored, a study of balance-of-power politics in post-Napoleonic Europe.\nFrom 1956 to 1958, Kissinger worked for the Rockefeller Brothers Fund as director of its Special Studies Project. He served as the director of the Harvard Defense Studies Program between 1958 and 1971. In 1958, he also co-founded the Center for International Affairs with Robert R. Bowie where he served as its associate director. Outside of academia, he served as a consultant to several government agencies and think tanks, including the Operations Research Office, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Department of State, and the RAND Corporation.Keen to have a greater influence on U.S. foreign policy, Kissinger became foreign policy advisor to the presidential campaigns of Nelson Rockefeller, supporting his bids for the Republican nomination in 1960, 1964, and 1968. Kissinger first met Richard Nixon at a party hosted by Clare Boothe Luce in 1967, saying that he found him more \"thoughtful\" than he expected. During the Republican primaries in 1968, Kissinger again served as the foreign policy adviser to Rockefeller and in July 1968 called Nixon \"the most dangerous of all the men running to have as president\". Initially upset when Nixon won the Republican nomination, the ambitious Kissinger soon changed his mind about Nixon and contacted a Nixon campaign aide, Richard Allen, to state he was willing to do anything to help Nixon win. After Nixon became president in January 1969, Kissinger was appointed as National Security Advisor. By this time, he was arguably \"one of the most important theorists about foreign policy ever to be produced by the United States of America\", according to his official biographer Niall Ferguson."

With the death of George Shultz in February 2021, Kissinger was the last surviving member of the Nixon administration Cabinet.The relationship between Nixon and Kissinger was unusually close, and has been compared to the relationships of Woodrow Wilson and Colonel House, or Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins. In all three cases, the State Department was relegated to a backseat role in developing foreign policy. Kissinger and Nixon shared a penchant for secrecy and conducted numerous \"backchannel\" negotiations, such as that through the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Dobrynin, that excluded State Department experts. Historian David Rothkopf has looked at the personalities of Nixon and Kissinger, saying:\n\nThey were a fascinating pair. In a way, they complemented each other perfectly. Kissinger was the charming and worldly Mr. Outside who provided the grace and intellectual-establishment respectability that Nixon lacked, disdained and aspired to. Kissinger was an international citizen. Nixon very much a classic American. Kissinger had a worldview and a facility for adjusting it to meet the times, Nixon had pragmatism and a strategic vision that provided the foundations for their policies. Kissinger would, of course, say that he was not political like Nixon\u2014but in fact he was just as political as Nixon, just as calculating, just as relentlessly ambitious ... these self-made men were driven as much by their need for approval and their neuroses as by their strengths.\nA proponent of Realpolitik, Kissinger played a dominant role in United States foreign policy between 1969 and 1977. In that period, he extended the policy of d\u00e9tente. This policy led to a significant relaxation in U.S.\u2013Soviet tensions and played a crucial role in 1971 talks with the People's Republic of China premier Zhou Enlai. The talks concluded with a rapprochement between the United States and China, and the formation of a new strategic anti-Soviet Sino-American alignment. He was jointly awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize with L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd for helping to establish a ceasefire and U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. The ceasefire, however, was not durable. Th\u1ecd declined to accept the award and Kissinger appeared deeply ambivalent about it\u2014he donated his prize money to charity, did not attend the award ceremony, and later offered to return his prize medal. As National Security Advisor in 1974, Kissinger directed the much-debated National Security Study Memorandum 200."

        "content": "After Nixon was forced to resign in the Watergate scandal, Kissinger's influence in the new presidential administration of Gerald R. Ford was diminished after he was replaced by Brent Scowcroft as National Security Advisor during the \"Halloween Massacre\" cabinet reshuffle of November 1975. Kissinger left office as Secretary of State when Democrat Jimmy Carter defeated Republican Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential elections.Kissinger continued to participate in policy groups, such as the Trilateral Commission, and to maintain political consulting, speaking, and writing engagements. In 1978, he was secretly involved in thwarting efforts by the Carter administration to indict three Chilean intelligence agents for masterminding the 1976 assassination of Orlando Letelier. Kissinger was critical of the foreign policy of the Jimmy Carter administration, saying in 1980 that \"has managed the extraordinary feat of having, at one and the same time, the worst relations with our allies, the worst relations with our adversaries, and the most serious upheavals in the developing world since the end of the Second World War.\"After Kissinger left office in 1977, he was offered an endowed chair at Columbia University, which was met with student opposition. Kissinger instead accepted a position at Georgetown University's Center for Strategic and International Studies. He taught at Georgetown's Edmund Walsh School of Foreign Service for several years in the late 1970s. In 1982, with the help of a loan from the international banking firm of E.M. Warburg, Pincus and Company, Kissinger founded a consulting firm, Kissinger Associates, and was a partner in affiliate Kissinger McLarty Associates with Mack McLarty, former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. He also served on the board of directors of Hollinger International, a Chicago-based newspaper group, and as of March 1999, was a director of Gulfstream Aerospace.\nIn September 1989, The Wall Street Journal's John Fialka disclosed that Kissinger took a direct economic interest in U.S.\u2013China relations in March 1989 with the establishment of China Ventures, Inc., a Delaware limited partnership, of which he was chairman of the board and chief executive officer. A US$75 million investment in a joint venture with the Communist Party government's primary commercial vehicle at the time, China International Trust & Investment Corporation (CITIC), was its purpose. Board members were major clients of Kissinger Associates. Kissinger was criticized for not disclosing his role in the venture when called upon by ABC's Peter Jennings to comment the morning after the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square massacre. Kissinger's position was generally supportive of Deng Xiaoping's decision to use the military against the demonstrating students and he opposed economic sanctions.\nFrom 1995 to 2001, Kissinger served on the board of directors for Freeport-McMoRan, a multinational copper and gold producer with significant mining and milling operations in Papua, Indonesia. In February 2000, president of Indonesia Abdurrahman Wahid appointed Kissinger as a political advisor. He also served as an honorary advisor to the United States-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce.In 1998, in response to the 2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal, the International Olympic Committee formed a commission, called the \"2000 Commission\", to recommend reforms, which Kissinger served on. This service led in 2000 to his appointment as one of five IOC \"honor members\", a category the organization described as granted to \"eminent personalities from outside the IOC who have rendered particularly outstanding services to it\".Kissinger served as the 22nd Chancellor of the College of William and Mary from 2000 to 2005. He was preceded by former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and succeeded by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The College of William & Mary also owns a painted portrait of Kissinger that was painted by Ned Bittinger.From 2000 to 2006, Kissinger served as chairman of the board of trustees of Eisenhower Fellowships. In 2006, upon his departure from Eisenhower Fellowships, he received the Dwight D. Eisenhower Medal for Leadership and Service.In November 2002, he was appointed by President George W. Bush to chair the newly established National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States to investigate the September 11 attacks. Kissinger stepped down as chairman on December 13, 2002, rather than reveal his business client list, when queried about potential conflicts of interest.In January 2007 Kissinger delivered a eulogy for Gerald Ford, one of the U.S. presidents he served, at Ford's state funeral in the Washington National Cathedral.\nIn April 2008 Kissinger gave a eulogy for the conservative author and founder of the National Review, William F. Buckley at the latter's memorial service at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.In the Rio Tinto espionage case of 2009\u20132010, Kissinger was paid US$5 million to advise the multinational mining company how to distance itself from an employee who had been arrested in China for bribery.\nKissinger\u2014along with William Perry, Sam Nunn, and George Shultz\u2014called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in three op-eds in The Wall Street Journal proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four created the Nuclear Threat Initiative to advance this agenda. In 2010, the four were featured in a documentary film entitled Nuclear Tipping Point. The film is a visual and historical depiction of the ideas laid forth in The Wall Street Journal op-eds and reinforces their commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and the steps that can be taken to reach that goal.On November 17, 2016, Kissinger met with President-elect Donald Trump during which they discussed global affairs. Kissinger also met with President Trump at the White House in May 2017.In an interview with Charlie Rose on August 17, 2017, Kissinger said about President Trump: \"I'm hoping for an Augustinian moment, for St. Augustine ... who in his early life followed a pattern that was quite incompatible with later on when he had a vision, and rose to sainthood. One does not expect the president to become that, but it's conceivable\". Kissinger also argued that Russian president Vladimir Putin wanted to weaken Hillary Clinton, not elect Donald Trump. Kissinger said that Putin \"thought\u2014wrongly incidentally\u2014that she would be extremely confrontational ... I think he tried to weaken the incoming president [Clinton]\"."

        "content": "A 2014 poll of American international relations scholars conducted by the College of William & Mary ranked Kissinger as the most effective Secretary of State in the 50 years prior to 2015. In 1972, Time commented that \"a streak of suspicion seems to underlie all that he does\" and \"His jokes about his paranoia have an uncomfortable edge of truth\". He was so often seen escorting Hollywood starlets that the Village Voice charged he was \"a secret square posing as a swinger\". The insight, \"Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac\", is widely attributed to him, although Kissinger was paraphrasing Napoleon Bonaparte. Critics on the right, such as Ray Takeyh, have faulted Kissinger for his role in the Nixon administration's opening to China and secret negotiations with North Vietnam. Takeyh writes that while rapprochement with China was a worthy goal, the Nixon administration failed to achieve any meaningful concessions from Chinese officials in return, as China continued to support North Vietnam and various \"revolutionary forces throughout the Third World\", \"nor does there appear to be even a remote, indirect connection between Nixon and Kissinger's diplomacy and the communist leadership's decision, after Mao's bloody rule, to move away from a communist economy towards state capitalism.\"Historian Jeffrey Kimball developed the theory that Kissinger and the Nixon administration accepted a South Vietnamese collapse provided a face-saving decent interval passed between U.S. withdrawal and defeat. In his first meeting with Zhou Enlai in 1971, Kissinger \"laid out in detail the settlement terms that would produce such a delayed defeat: total American withdrawal, return of all American POWs, and a ceasefire-in-place for '18 months or some period'\", in the words of historian Ken Hughes. On October 6, 1972, Kissinger told Nixon twice that the terms of the Paris Peace Accords would probably destroy South Vietnam: \"I also think that Thieu is right, that our terms will eventually destroy him.\" However, Kissinger denied using a \"decent interval\" strategy, writing \"All of us who negotiated the agreement of October 12 were convinced that we had vindicated the anguish of a decade not by a 'decent interval' but by a decent settlement.\" Johannes Kadura offers a positive assessment of Nixon and Kissinger's strategy, arguing that the two men \"simultaneously maintained a Plan A of further supporting Saigon and a Plan B of shielding Washington should their maneuvers prove futile.\" According to Kadura, the \"decent interval\" concept has been \"largely misrepresented\", in that Nixon and Kissinger \"sought to gain time, make the North turn inward, and create a perpetual equilibrium\" rather than acquiescing in the collapse of South Vietnam.Kissinger's record was brought up during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Hillary Clinton had cultivated a close relationship with Kissinger, describing him as a \"friend\" and a source of \"counsel\". During the Democratic primary debates, Clinton touted Kissinger's praise for her record as secretary of state. In response, candidate Bernie Sanders criticized Kissinger and said: \"I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.\"Kissinger was an immensely beloved figure within China, with China News Service describing him in his obituary as someone \"who had a sharp vision and a thorough understanding of world affairs\"."

He was a monk of the Michaelsberg Abbey, Bamberg and former chaplain to Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth of Poland, whence he knew the Pomeranian language of the temporarily Polish-subjugated West Slavic population, whereas the Joms Vikings and other Germanic inhabitants of the Pomeranian coast understood his old German language."

Adalbert is assumed to be of Polish origin.The territory was  put under the jurisdiction of the archbishopric of Magdeburg by Holy Roman emperor Otto I, King of Germany. In 1133 the Magdeburg archbishop Saint Norbert received verification by the pope of his jurisdiction over a number of dioceses, including those in Pomerania. However, bishop Otto of Bamberg had actually baptized the Pomeranians and therefore thought to add it to his southern Bamberg archdiocese and in order to avoid conflicts, pope Innocent II exempted the Pomeranian bishopric(s). \nOtto did not succeed during his lifetime in founding a diocese, due to a conflict between the archbishops of Magdeburg and Gniezno about ecclesiastical hegemony in the area. Pope Innocent II founded the diocese by a papal bull of 14 October 1140, and made the church of St. Adalbert at (Julin (Wollin/Wolin) on Wollin/Wolin island the see of the diocese. In the bull, the new diocese was placed \"under the protection of the see of the Holy Peter\", thwarting ambitions of the archbishops of Magdeburg and Gniezno, who both wanted to incorporate the new diocese as suffragan into their archdioceses.Otto had recommended his chaplain Adalbert as bishop, which was supported by Ratibor I, Duke of Pomerania. Adalbert was consecrated bishop at Rome. Adalbert and Ratibor I founded Stolpe Abbey at the side of Wartislaw I's assassination by a pagan in 1153, the first monastery in Pomerania. The new foundation was occupied by monks from Berge Abbey near Magdeburg and all churches to be built in the future were subordinated to it.\nIn 1147, the Wendish Crusade, a campaign of the Northern Crusades, was mounted by bishops and nobles of the Holy Roman Empire. The crusaders pillaged the land and besieged Demmin and Szczecin despite the fact that both towns were (officially) Christian already. Adalbert took part in the negotiations that finally led to the lifting of the Szczecin siege by the crusaders.After the death of Duke Ratibor I, Adalbert received the same support from his two nephews, Dukes Bogislaw I and Kasimir I. His last act was the confirmation of the richly gifted Grobe Monastery near Usedom, founded by Ratibor I, on 8 June 1159.\nWhen Wolin was destroyed by Danes in the late 12th century, the diocese was moved to Cammin (also Kammin, now Kamie\u0144 Pomorski ); this bishopric became known as the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kammin.\n\n\n== References =="

His father was from a Leonese family of blacksmiths and his mother was from an Andalucian family of miners. In 1905, the family moved to Argentina, settling in Santa Fe.After working a number of jobs, in 1913, the young Sinesio returned to Le\u00f3n and earned his bachelor's degree at a local university. After some travels around Catalonia and the Basque Country, in 1915, he enrolled at the University of Madrid, where he studied the humanities, graduating as a Doctor of Philosophy. In the Spanish capital, he began to live a bohemian lifestyle, taking the pseudonym Diego Abad de Santill\u00e1n while writing for dissident journals.Santill\u00e1n participated in the 1917 Spanish general strike, for which he was imprisoned for a year. After receiving an amnesty, he returned to Argentina, briefly reuniting with his family in Santa Fe before moving to the capital Buenos Aires. There he joined the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation (FORA), working as editor of its newspaper La Protesta. In 1922, he went to Germany and participated in the establishment of the International Workers' Association (IWA), staying behind in Berlin in order to study medicine. There he met a number of famous anarchists, including Max Nettlau, for whom he helped translate his works into Spanish. In 1925, he briefly went to Mexico and helped organise the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) before returning to Argentina, where he took part in the Sacco & Vanzetti defense campaign and wrote a history of anarchism in Argentina. In the wake of the 1930 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat, he was sentenced to death for sedition, but managed to escape into exile in the newly-established Spanish Republic.In Spain, Santill\u00e1n joined the Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and became secretary of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI), for which he edited their respective newspapers Solidaridad Obrera and Tierra y Libertad. Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he joined the Central Committee of Antifascist Militias of Catalonia and was appointed Minister of Economy in the Catalan government. In the wake of the May Days, he took a critical line against the government of Juan Negr\u00edn and the Communist Party of Spain (PCE), publishing After the Revolution, which outlined a program for workers' self-management under anarcho-syndicalism. In the program, Santill\u00e1n invoked British utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill in his attacks against capitalism, declaring:\n\nStuart Mill is right. We believe that such a society has no right to existence and we desire its total transformation. We want a socialized economy in which the land, the factories, the homes, the means of transport cease to be the monopoly of private ownership and become the collective property of the entire community.\nWhen the Republic was defeated, Santill\u00e1n fled into exile in France, before finally returning to Argentina. There he continued his historical work and contributed to dictionaries and encyclopedias, notably writing Why We Lost the War, which his son Luis later adapted into film. He largely ceased political activities and gravitated increasingly towards reformism, defending anarchist collaboration with the Republican government during the war, while also coming to prioritise the abolition of the state over the abolition of capitalism.During the Spanish transition to democracy, Santill\u00e1n finally returned to Spain, settling in Barcelona, where he died in 1983."

        "content": "The son of Lacasse Rousseau and Gabrielle Fafard, Andr\u00e9 Rousseau was born on January 12, 1911, in Saint-Lambert Quebec, on the South Shore (Montreal). He was the seventh child in a family of 14 (12 boys and 2 girls). He studied at the Soeurs de la Providence and at the Notre-Dame-du-Saint-Rosaire school in Montreal, the Sacre-C\u0153ur college in Montmagny and the Seminaire de Qu\u00e9bec. His first wife was C\u00e9cile Collin, deceased in 1957, with whom he had 6 daughters and one adopted son. In 1959, he married Simone Ouellet who already had 4 children.\nAt the young age of 16, Andr\u00e9 Rousseau began work in one of his father's companies. His father, Lacasse, has been recognized as a pioneer in the development of electricity in the Montmagny\u2014L'Islet region. From 1935 to 1940, Andr\u00e9 Rousseau worked at Dufresne Engineering and was in charge of overseeing the electrification project during the construction of the Wellington tunnel that passed under the Lachine Canal and the Pierre Le Gardeur Bridge in Montreal. From 1940 to 1950, he was Vice President of Electrical Manufacturing Limited in Montmagny, a company also founded by his father, (which later became Montel).\nIn 1950, after relocating to Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, Andr\u00e9 Rousseau rounded Rousseau Metal inc., and  later Moto-Kometik in the 1970s. He was President of Rousseau Metal inc., until his retirement in 1985 and was succeeded by his son-in-law, Simon-Pierre Par\u00e9. From 1950 to 1960 Rousseau was a Director of Paul Dumont Ltd. in Saint-Romuald, Quebec, and  of Artistic Decalcomania in Montreal. Rousseau was a defender of private enterprise and assisted in the financial rescue of many enterprises in Quebec headed for bankruptcy, including Moto-Kometik which was consolidated with Rousseau Metal Inc."

        "content": "Rousseau was a friend of Georges-\u00c9mile Lapalme and held the position as Secretary of the Quebec Liberal Party in 1956 and as President in 1957 and 1958. He was consulted by Lapalme in the weeks preceding the Liberal convention of May 1958. In June 1960 at the National Assembly of Quebec, he was elected to serve as a Member of Parliament for the Quebec Liberal Party in the county of Montmagny-L'Islet. In July, he was named Minister of Industry and Commerce under the government of Jean Lesage. During his mandate as Minister, he accomplished many projects. Among these were the creation of an Economic Research Office and a Statistics Office; the funding for creating the Centre de l'organisation scientifique de l'entreprise (Cose); the creation of the Loi des fonds industriels municipaux; the division of Quebec into regions (see List of regions of Quebec) and the installation of delegates of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce into each of these regions; and finally, the creation of Economic Boards, now known as the Conseil regional de d\u00e9veloppement (CRD's). On an international level, he succeeded in giving weight to economic teams of the first delegations outside of Quebec in New York, London and Paris.\nAlthough Rousseau was personally opposed to the nationalization of private electricity companies, he remained faithful to the government, and sought a second mandate at the 1962 Quebec general election. Although defeated on election night,  by Fernand Lizotte of the Union Nationale (Quebec),  Rousseau remained very active in the political arena. From 1963 to 1968, he was the Representative of the Quebec Government on the Board of Directors and as an executive for Expo 67 in Montreal. In 1970, he became the first president of the Bouchard Foundation and from 1972 to 1980, the President of the Societe du Parc Industriel du centre-du-Quebec de Becancour, Quebec.  He reentered politics during the 1976 Quebec general election as a candidate for the Union Nationale in Montmagny-L'Islet but was defeated by the liberal Julien Giasson.\nHe was also president of the Commission industrielle et touristique de Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, and from 1990 to 1993, president of the fund-raising campaign for the l'Institut Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de recherche sur la culture, enabling the publication of the impressive \"Histoire de la Cote-du-Sud\", an essential work for anyone interested in the history of Montmagny and surrounding areas. It should also be noted that he was a member of many other different organizations such as: The Association professionnelle des industriels, the Centre des dirigeants d'entreprise, the Association des manufacturiers Canadiens, the Club de la garnison, Knights of Columbus, the Richelieu Club, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Saint-Jean-Port-Joli and the Association des Amis de Saint-Benoit-du-Lac.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Rosamund Stanhope was born on 4 March 1919 in Northampton as the daughter of a Latvian (German by adoption) leather merchant who changed his name after her birth from Steinberg to Stanhope. She grew up in a wealthy and distant British family setting, boarding at two independent schools. She trained as an actress at the Royal Central School of Speech & Drama, where she was taught by Elsie Fogerty, and embarked on her career at the Northgate Theatre, Exeter, but was diverted by the outbreak of the Second World War. She joined the Women's Royal Naval Service and spent the war working as a radio mechanic in Crail, Scotland. She subsequently worked for the BBC, in the Latin American dance band department, and after her marriage as secretary for Miron Grindea and his literary magazine ADAM International Review.  After her daughter was born, she returned in 1952 to the Central School, where she retrained as a teacher.\nAs well as the three collections published between 1962 and 1992, Stanhope regularly had poems published in various literary and other magazines, such as the New Statesman, Time and Tide, The Times Literary Supplement, and The Anglo-Welsh Review. Her first collection was published in March 1962 by John Rolph at the Scorpion Press. The following year, in 1963, she completed an external degree in English from the University of London. In the same year, she broke her spine in an accident at her home. Partially paralysed and psychologically traumatised from the event, she was hospitalised for a string of related problems over 30 times between 1963 and 1969, and thereafter suffered chronic and intense pain. Additionally, she underwent a colostomy after an operation to remove colon cancer, during which her bladder was injured, resulting in further complications.\nAs well as working as a tutor for Wolsey Hall, a home schooling college, she maintained her teaching position for nearly two decades, finally retiring in 1987 at the age of 68, and continued writing, producing seven unpublished novels, written in the immediate aftermath of her accident, and numerous poems. Two collections of her poems were published by Peterloo Press; she also featured as the Poetry Review\u2032s Poet of the Month. After decades of increasing debilitation, she died peacefully at her home on 7 December 2005.\nIn 2020, US publishing house Flood Editions republished So I Looked Down to Camelot with an afterword by poet and professor of literature Graham Foust.  At this time Jennifer Moxley wrote of the book: \"Rare is the poet who makes us see the visible world anew, but rarer still is she who uses her 'lace intelligence' to bend familiar English into a foreign tongue. Reading this astonishing book I fell in love with poetry again, which is, at its best, a 'difficult love.' Stanhope's poems clock the personhood of time, abstract the world, and concretize the mind. While reading I thought of Dickinson and Schuyler, I thought of H. D., of Blake and Coleridge, yet Stanhope is unique. Her poems give evidence (just in time) that though we be 'headcuffed in the gaol of day,' an 'unaccustomed thought' can still 'slip out of the galaxy.'\""

The busy actor is also seen frequently in Eid-special TV plays.\nChowdhury plays a key role, called \u2018Laley\u2019, in Aronyak's popular production Shangkranti. In Che'er Cycle (a Bengali Theatre production), he plays six different characters including those of Fidel Castro and a peace-loving young boy, Shubhro \u2014 demonstrating his versatility. Chowdhury considers his performance in Che'er Cycle as one of his best works on stage so far. On his contemporaries, the actor says, several artistes are doing well. Among them, AKM Hasan, Mosharraf Karim, Shamim Zaman, Anisur Rahman Milon, Nusrat Imroz Tisha, Chandni and Richi Solaiman have done some impressive works. Chowdhury says that performing in front of the camera is relatively easy for him, thanks to his experience on stage. He adds, acting in films is more challenging than TV plays because of its duration and format. He has also been a playback singer, along with Meher Afroz Shaon, in the 2012 war film depicting the Bangladesh Liberation War, Pita \nAlso known for famous children show \"Sisimpur\" where he played the character of \"Mukul\""

        "content": "Born Maurice F\u00e9lix Thomas in the \u00c9pinettes district (17th arrondissement of Paris), his father was a wholesaler. As a young man, Maurice Thomas first trained as a graphic designer and a magazine illustrator but was soon drawn to the theater. In 1904, he married the actress Fernande Petit. They had a son, Jacques (1904\u20131977), who would follow his father into the film industry, establishing his own reputation as a director of American films in the 1940s and 1950s.Using the stage name Maurice Tourneur, he began his show business career performing in secondary roles on stage and eventually toured England and South America as part of the theater company for the great star Gabrielle R\u00e9jane. Drawn to the new art of filmmaking, in 1911 he began working as an assistant director for the \u00c9clair company. A quick learner and an innovator, within a short time he was directing films on his own using major French stars of the day such as Polaire.\n\nIn 1914, with the expansion of the giant French film companies into the United States market, Tourneur moved to New York City to direct silent films for \u00c9clair's American branch studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey before moving to William A. Brady's World Film Corporation, where he directed important early American feature-length films such as The Wishing Ring, Alias Jimmy Valentine, The Cub (Martha Hedman's only screen performance) and Trilby, the last starring Clara Kimball Young and noted stage actor Wilton Lackaye as Svengali. Before long, Maurice Tourneur was a major and respected force in American film and a founding member of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association. As the feature film evolved in the mid 1910s, he and his team (comprising screenwriter Charles Maigne, art director Ben Carr\u00e9, and cameramen John van den Broek and Lucien Andriot) coupled exceptional technological skill with unique pictorial and architectural sensibilities in their productions, giving their films a visual distinctiveness that met with critical acclaim.\n\nTourneur admired D.W. Griffith and considered the skill level of American actors at the time ahead of their counterparts in Europe. Of the actresses he worked with, he called Mary Pickford the finest screen actress in the world and believed that stage actress Elsie Ferguson was a brilliant artist. However, Tourneur opposed the evolving star system that Carl Laemmle had begun with his advertising campaign for actress Florence Lawrence.\nAfter directing several innovative films for Adolph Zukor's Artcraft Pictures Corporation (which released through Paramount) in 1917 and 1918, Tourneur launched his own production company with the film Sporting Life. In 1921 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. By 1922 he believed that the future of the film industry lay in Hollywood and the following year he was hired by Samuel Goldwyn to go to the West Coast and make a film version of the Hall Caine novel The Christian. However, Tourneur's career in the United States faltered in the 1920s as his pictorialism sometimes hampered the narrative drive of his later films, and he also separated from his wife Fernande in 1923. He was removed from production on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's version of Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island in 1928, and this marked the end of his American career.\nAfter his trouble with MGM, Tourneur decided to move back to his native France. There, he continued to make films both at home and in Germany, easily making the change to talkies. In 1933 he met his second wife, actress Louise Lagrange (1898\u20131979), while shooting his film, L'Homme myst\u00e9rieux. Tourneur went on to direct another two dozen films, several of which were crime thrillers, until a 1949 automobile accident in which he was seriously injured and lost a leg. Health and age prevented him from directing more films, but a voracious reader and a skilled hobby artist, he kept busy painting and translating detective novels from English into French.\nAfter his death in 1961, Maurice Tourneur was interred in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.\nMaurice Tourneur was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6243 Hollywood Blvd.\nHis 1917 film, The Poor Little Rich Girl, his 1918 film The Blue Bird and his 1920 film The Last of the Mohicans have since been deemed \"culturally significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Recently, the American Film Institute's Center for Film and Video Preservation and the National Archives of Canada have been cooperating on the restoration of Tourneur's 1915 film, The Cub."

His father, only a linen worker, could not give Libavius an education because in this time period only the wealthy were able to get a higher education. Showing great intelligence as a child Livavius overcame his personal status and attended the University of Whittenburg at the age of eighteen in 1578. In 1579 he entered the University of Jena where he studied philosophy, history and medicine. In 1581 he obtained the academic degree of magister artium and was named a poet laureate.\nHe began teaching in Ilmenau in 1581 and remained there until 1586 when he moved to Coburg to teach there. In 1588 he went to study at the University of Basel and received the degree of medicinae doctor. Shortly thereafter, he became a professor of history and poetry at the University of Jena. At the same time, he also supervised the disputations in the field of medicine.\nIn 1591 he became physician of the city council of Rothenburg and, one year later, became the superintendent of schools. This position led to conflict with the rector of schools causing Libavius to move to Coburg in 1605. In 1606 he was offered and accepted the position of headmaster of the reestablished Casimirianum Gymnasium in Coburg. He lived in Coburg from 1607 until his death in 1616.\nLittle is known about his personal life, but he did have two sons, Michael, and Andreas, who followed in his father's footsteps and became a teacher and physician. He also had two daughters, Susanna, and one whose name is not known."

        "content": "Libavius is best known for his work as an alchemist above all else. Alchemy was an early science whose goals were to transform matter like turning base metals to gold. Alchemists also tried to find an elixir of life that would allow them to cure all disease. Alchemy is the study that turned into what we know today as chemistry. Libavius believed that his studies in alchemy would help further advancements in the medical field.In 1597 Libavius published Alchemia, a textbook that summarized all the discoveries alchemists had made at this point. Alchemia was organized into four parts: what to have in a laboratory, descriptions of procedures, chemical analysis, and transmutation. Publishing such a book was blasphemous, as many alchemists wanted to keep their findings to themselves to prevent their findings from being misused. Libavius thought that knowledge should be shared if it could be used to help better mankind.\nHis studies in alchemy led to many new discoveries in chemistry. He discovered methods to prepare a number of chemicals like hydrochloric acid, ammonium sulfate and tin chloride. He also recorded the dangers of alchemy, as most of it was done in homes, and proposed the development of a series of laboratories, called chemical houses, to make alchemy a safer practice."

        "content": "Libavius was a staunch believer in chrysopoeia, or the ability to transmute a base metal into gold. This viewpoint was a matter of much debate for alchemists of the time, and he defended it in several of his writings. Though he did discover several new chemical processes, he tended to be more of a theoretician, and he leaned toward traditional Aristotelianism rather than Paracelsian alchemy.\nHe was an opponent of Paracelsus on the grounds of Paracelsus' disrespect for ancient thought, magnification of personal experience above others' experience, overstatement of the didactic function of nature, use of magical words and symbols in natural philosophy, confusion of natural and supernatural causes, interjection of seeds into the creation of the universe, and postulation of astral influences. Despite this, he did not entirely reject all Paracelsian methods.\nIn The Rosicrucian Enlightenment, Frances Yates states:\n\nAndrea Libavius was one of those chymists who was influenced up to a point by the new teachings of Paracelsus in that he accepted the use of the new chemical remedies in medicine advocated by Paracelsus, whilst adhering theoretically to the traditional Aristotelian and Galenist teachings and rejecting Paracelsist mysticism. Aristotle and Galen appear, honourably placed, on the title-page of Libavius's main work, the Alchymia, published at Frankfurt in 1596 ... Libavius criticized the Rosicrucian Fama and Confessio in several works. Basing himself on the texts of the two manifestos, Libavius raises serious objections to them on scientific, political, and religious grounds. Libavius is strongly against theories of macro-microcosmic harmony, against Magia and Cabala, against Hermes Trismegistus (from whose supposed writings he makes many quotations), against Agrippa and Trithemius\u2014in short he is against the Renaissance tradition.\nHe accepted the Paracelsian principle of using occult properties to explain phenomena with no apparent cause but rejected the conclusion that a thing possessing these properties must have an astral connection to the divine.\nHe was also critical of alchemists who claimed to have produced a panacea, or cure-all, not because he didn't believe that a panacea was possible, but because these alchemists invariably refused to disclose their formulas. He believed that anyone who managed to create a panacea was duty bound to teach the process to as many other people as possible, so that it could benefit mankind. He was particularly critical of Georgius am Wald (also called Georgius an und von Wald), an alchemist who wrote a book in which he claimed to have made a panacea. Libavius considered am Wald to be a fraud and declared that am Wald's panacea was no more than sulfur and mercury, not gold as am Wald claimed. Between 1595 and 1596 he dedicated four volumes, Neoparacelsica, Tractatus duo physici, Gegenbericht von der Panacea Amwaldina, and Panacea Amwaldina victa to exposing am Wald as a quack."

His father, uncle, half-brother and brother John, would all die of Huntington's disease (HD). John, five years older than Charles, was, before he became symptomatic, an Oxford graduate and barrister in London.In interviews, Sabine has described why he then chose to use what remaining time he had, to switch battlefields from Baghdad to the one facing HD families due to unparalleled misrepresentation, discrimination and prejudice: \u201cMy neurologist said: \u2018there is nothing you can do about this disease, just live your life as well as you can.\u2019\u201d Sabine relates. In the coming months, however, he realised that: \u201cThe neurologist was completely wrong. There is everything I can do about this disease. The problem, is finding the time to do it all.\u201dAmong keynote lectures across four continents, Sabine has spoken at the Royal Society, the European Parliament, the World Congress for Freedom of Scientific research, the Italian Senate, the Harvard Club, and the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste (SISSA). Sabine has become one of the foremost lay opinions on the ethics of future scientific research.\nJennifer Doudna, Nobel Laureate and inventor of CRSPR gene editing, closed her 2017 \u2018TED\u2019 treatise on the ethics of gene editing with a quote from Sabine: \u201cAbove all else, we must respect people\u2019s freedom to choose their own genetic destiny and strive for healthier, happier lives ... As Charles Sabine \u2026 put it, \u201cAnyone who has to actually face the reality of one of these diseases is not going to have a remote compunction about thinking that there is any moral issue at all.\u201d Who are we to tell him otherwise?\u201d.Sabine contributed to the drafting of the late Senator Edward Kennedy's last act of legislation\u2014the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (\"GINA\"), designed to protect the rights of individuals with genetic predispositions in the American workplace and in insurance.Sabine was an active lobbyist in the successful implementation of the UK's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008. The 50th Anniversary of Canada's Gairdner Foundation in 2009, attended by 22 Nobel Laureates, was marked by a debate between Sabine and Nobel Laureate Sydney Brenner about the future of personalised genomics. In 2009 he was the star guest at the Italian National Telethon, for which a film about him was produced by RAI cinema.Sabine is a spokesperson for Huntington's disease lay associations around the world, among them:\n\nUSA: Huntington's Disease Society of America\nUK:    Huntington's Disease AssociationSabine is a member of the Global Advisory Council of the International Society for Stem Cell Research.Sabine is Consulting Publisher to the Huntington's disease research news web platform HDBuzz, founded by Dr Jeff Carroll and Dr Ed Wild.Featured in the 2013 documentary Alive & Well, Sabine discusses his advocacy work to raise awareness of Huntington's disease.\nExcerpts from Sabine speeches were used by James K Wright in his song \"Spring in your Step\".\nIn her 2022 New Year Honours list, the Queen awarded the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) to Sabine, \"Philanthropist and Global Campaigner, Huntington\u2019s Disease for Charitable and Voluntary Services\".

Its mission is to \"empower and enable patients and families facing Huntington's disease, to step out of the shadows of shame, stigma and fear. Huntington's is often described as the 'harshest affliction known to mankind,' but unlike other diseases, the daily suffering it inflicts, is uniquely compounded by the fact that the vast majority of those families carrying the HD gene, feel compelled to hide that reality.\"The first Hidden No More event took place on 30 June 2010, when more than a year of campaigning and fundraising by Sabine in partnership with Sir Michael Rawlins culminated in the launch of an All-Party Parliamentary Group for Huntington's disease in the UK Parliament. Chaired by Lord Walton of Detchant and supported by more than 40 MPs and Lords, the purpose of the Group was to raise the profile of Huntington's disease and establish a better methodology for estimating its prevalence, and thus lead to allocation of more appropriate resources for care and research. Within twenty-four months, the research commissioned showed that the disease was indeed more than twice as common as previously estimated.Then, on May 18, 2017, Sabine became the first person with Huntington's disease to meet publicly with a world leader when Pope Francis said to a Global TV audience and an audience of 1,800, the largest number of people ever gathered in relation to Huntington's disease:\nToday, however, we are here because we want to say to ourselves and all the world: \u201cHIDDEN NO MORE!\u201d, \u201cOCULTA NUNCA MAS!\u201d, \u201cMAI PIU\u2019 NASCOSTA!\u201d. It is not simply a slogan, so much as a commitment that we all must foster.\nThe events of that day, and the extraordinary journey of Huntington's families to Rome from some of the poorest and most remote places on earth, was made into a film Dancing at the Vatican, released on Amazon and YouTube in six languages. Dancing at the Vatican premiered in Hollywood, California in July 2019. The documentary's European premiere took place at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), in February, 2020."

In 1992, he began writing daily columns on television for Le Monde, critiquing the way in which TV presents information and influences viewers, continuing the tradition of television criticism begun thirty years earlier by writers like Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac or Morvan Lebesque (see, on this subject, the book The Critical Eye - The Television Critic (L'\u0153il critique - Le journaliste critique de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision) by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bourdon and Jean-Michel Frodon.)\nIn 1995, the success of his written columns allowed him to create a weekly program on France 5 called \"Arr\u00eat sur images\" (\"Freeze-Frame\"), which he both produced and moderated.  The journalist Pascale Clark anchored the show with him during the first year.  The objective of Arr\u00eat sur images is to \"decode\" television's images and talk, and with the help of diverse columnists and journalists, to analyze the sources and the effectiveness of the narrative use of media.  The program tries to use the Internet for the purposes of self-criticism.  Each month, an internet  \"forum-master,\" who is responsible for following the viewer debates in the internet forum for Arr\u00eat sur images, comes on the show to question Daniel Schneidermann about remarks submitted by the contributors to the site.\nSchneidermann wrote weekly columns for Le Monde  until October 2003, when he was fired, after the publication of his book The Media Nightmare (Le Cauchemar m\u00e9diatique), in which he deplored the fact that the management of Le Monde had not responded to criticism directed at them by the authors of the book The Dark Side of Le Monde.  In his last column (A Column at Sea or Une chronique \u00e0 la mer ), he related how disappointed and surprised he was by the sanctions of a paper, which vaunts its transparency.\nHe became a media columnist for the daily newspaper Lib\u00e9ration, whose publisher, Serge July, he had derided in 1989 in his book Where are the cameras? (O\u00f9 sont les cam\u00e9ras ?) ; notably, July rebuked Schneidermann for having \"changed sides.\"\nSchneidermann shows an equal interest in analysis of the internet as a source of data, notably in regard to the development of blogs, and of the Wikipedia website.   In 2006, for example, he stated that he considered the development of anonymous biographers and encyclopedists a terrifying prospect."

Her work investigates the nature of performance in itself and explores the relationship between the text and the performer, between the performer and space, and the role of the spectator in the performative experience. She describes her works as \"an exploration of space and the role that space plays in the construction and experience of narratives \u2013 whether it is the space of the human body, or the space of the place within which the performance is happening.\" Her first major theatre production was 'Roland Schimmelpfennig's Arabian Night', an experimental site-specific installation and performance supported by Max Mueller Bhavan in association with Khoj International Artists' Association. The production opened in Khoj Studios, New Delhi, in 2006 and was presented again in Seoul Performing Arts Festival, Seoul, 2007.\nShe continued this style of site-specific installation and performance art with her next project, 'On Seeing', based on Haruki Murakami's short story, On Seeing the 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning, presented in 2008 at Khoj Studios, New Delhi and different theatre festivals and at Essl Museum, Vienna in 2010. Set in three rooms at Khoj Studios, New Delhi, this performance required the audience to move with the actors. Chaudhuri explains about this unique performance, \"When the performance and audience move \u2013 the text gets fragmented. I wanted to explore that connection.\"Chaudhuri's project 'Some Stage Directions for Henrik Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman' based on Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen's penultimate play, John Gabriel Borkman with texts by the Raqs Media Collective was commissioned for the Delhi Ibsen Festival, 2009.Chaudhuri's later work consisted of installations developed from her stage productions. Her next project, 'Propositions: On text and Space', a take-off from her earlier stage production, 'Some Stage Directions for Henrik Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman', developed in collaboration with Khoj Studios' Artist Residency programme in 2010, does away with the actors and is translated through space and texts from the play. Her next project, 'Propositions: On text and Space II', a light and text installation, based on texts from Roland Schimmelpfennig's play 'Before/Afterwards', opened at Project 88, Mumbai, in collaboration with Max Mueller Bhavan, Mumbai in 2011. Devoid of any performers, the installation of the play, investigates the nature of narrative in text, sound, space and light.Her latest project, 'Seen at Secunderabad', in collaboration with Raqs Media Collective, was a multi-media performance that attempted to deconstruct a photograph taken by colonial war photographer Felice Beato in 1857. The project premiered in Kunstenfestivaldesarts, Brussels in 2011."

He entered Kyoto University in 1912 and studied philosophy with Kitar\u014d Nishida, one of the most prominent Japanese philosophers of his time and the author of An Inquiry into the Good. With Nishida\u2019s recommendation, Hisamatsu joined the Rinzai Zen monastery of My\u014dshin-ji in Kyoto in 1915 and studied Zen Buddhism with Zen Master Ikegami Sh\u014dsan. After his monastic life at My\u014dshin-ji, he established his original philosophical view, which consists of both Eastern (mainly Zen Buddhist) and Western philosophy. Shortly after that, Hisamatsu received a doctorate degree from Kyoto University.\nBetween 1943 and 1949, he taught philosophy and religious studies at Kyoto University. While in Kyoto, Hisamatsu frequently discussed Zen Buddhism and philosophy with D.T. Suzuki at Shunk\u014d-in, where he lived. He also became the teacher of Masao Abe. Abe became a leader in interfaith dialogue. In 1958 Hisamatsu and Carl Jung held a brief conversation in Switzerland. \"Specifically, their conversation centered on Jung's notion of Self and the Zen notion of 'No Mind', as well as their respective views of human suffering and its alleviation.\" Each appeared to see, however, that then a genuine understanding in depth was premature. Even as they spoke through translators, the key words were susceptible to multiple interpretations.Hisamatsu was a founder of the FAS Society. The FAS Society\u2019s origin, Gakud\u014d D\u014dj\u014d, was established by students of Kyoto University under Hisamatsu's guidance. In 1960, Gakud\u014d D\u014dj\u014d was renamed FAS Society for their international activities. The purpose of this society is to spread the standpoint of the fundamental self-awakening of all mankind.\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium the message of Hisamatsu is kept alive by Zen teacher Ton Lathouwers."

He studied at Eton and received a BA from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1810 as Second Wrangler, second Smith's Prizeman, and chancellor's medalist, attesting to his keen intelligence. He received his MA in 1813, and was subsequently elected to a fellowship at Trinity. He then entered the Inns of Court, initially at Lincoln's Inn in 1810, but he migrated to the Inner Temple in 1813 and was called to the bar in 1818.

These achievements led him into friendship with George Stephenson, and he played a role in the survey and engineering of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, particularly the crossing of Chat Moss. However, he resigned as a director of the line shortly before its completion.\nIn the early days of railroading, it was by no means clear that the steam locomotive would come to be the principal form of propulsion for trains. Brandreth invented a machine which used a horse galloping on a treadmill as its source of motive power. A prototype, the Cycloped, participated in the Rainhill Trials in 1829, but it had to be withdrawn when the horse broke through the floor of the machine. In any case, the trials proved the superiority of steam motive power in all but exceptional circumstances."

A move to London further diminished his legal practice, and he ultimately declined the offer of a judgeship in Jamaica and retired to Worthing and devoted himself to the education of his children.\nIn retirement, he again took up the study of classical literature, and made a lengthy inquiry into the use of the digamma in the works of Homer. His studies were published in 1844 as A Dissertation on the Metre of Homer; and reflected in an edition of the Iliad with digammas. This was followed by a well-received translation of the Iliad into blank verse in 1846. Brandreth died in Worthing in 1873. He took an interest of local affairs, becoming a justice of the peace for West Sussex and taking a hand in the improvement of the town's infrastructure."

After his retirement in 1982, he moved briefly to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and then to Everett, Washington, where he continued his work in mental health advocacy when the Governor of Washington appointed him Chair of the Western Washington State Hospital Governing Board where he served for 12 years. Dr. Brooks was also active with Boards for Snohomish County Mental Health, Compass Health and Planned Parenthood. Because of his strong interests in the criminalization of the mentally ill, he established a fund under the Foundation for Excellence in Mental Health Care to \"decriminalize the mentally ill\" and recruited many renowned leaders from across the United States in psychiatry, law, journalism and psychology to work as the Dorothea Dix Think Tank."

        "content": "While in Boston, Tappan was disturbed by the fate of fugitive slaves who were caught pursuant to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and returned to servile labor. Tappan was encouraged in his abolitionism by family members and prominent men, who included Wendell Phillips, William Lloyd Garrison, Theodore Parker, and others.\nIn May 1854, the capture of the slave Anthony Burns in Boston and forced return by US Marshals stirred a fierce reaction among Boston's abolitionists. Crowds lined the street to protest his being shipped back to slavery in the South. This event may have inspired Tappan to take personal action following passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act.\nAt the age of 23, Tappan was one of a group of 29 New England settlers who came to found what later became Lawrence, Kansas, in August 1854 as part of the New England Emigrant Aid Company's \"pioneer party\". They were trying to arrange for anti-slavery advocates to settle in Kansas before the vote on whether it should be free or a slave state. He staked a claim to land that abutted the claim of the homeopathic physician Dr. John Doy, formerly of Rochester, New York. He was also a correspondent for Horace Greeley's New York Tribune and did some writing for the Boston Atlas and several other newspapers, reporting on the territory's first difficulties with border raiders. As an active abolitionist, he covered the antislavery movement in the Kansas Territory, including reports dealing with the armed and sometimes deadly conflicts between the territory's Pro-Slavery advocates and those aligned with the Free-State movement. Tappan was also actively involved in the Underground Railroad, moving slaves through Kansas to northern states. He also participated in 1855 in Jacob Branson's rescue during the short-lived Wakarusa War.Tappan became active in the volatile political activity in the territory. In 1855, accompanied by political activist Martin F. Conway, he traveled through southern and western Kansas, speaking in favor of the free-state movement. He also maintained close ties to both the Kansas-based and East Coast leadership of the New England Emigrant Aid Company and participated in helping to smuggle arms (nicknamed \"Beecher's Bibles\") and other assistance to Free-Soil settlers. Tappan was clerk of the Topeka constitutional convention, assistant clerk of the House of Representatives in 1856, and the following year performed the duties of Speaker of the Topeka House of Representatives. He was secretary of the Leavenworth constitutional convention in 1858, and acted as clerk of the Wyandotte convention in 1859. His first cousin, Lewis N. Tappan, also emigrated to Kansas in 1857, and was Secretary of the Senate under the Topeka Constitution. Lewis Tappan was one of the Fort Scott Treaty Commissioners. Both Lewis and Sam were among the 15 armed men who captured the box containing the altered election returns at Lecompton, the discovery of which resulted in the overthrow of the pro-slavery party in Kansas.In 1860, Tappan relocated as a \"Pike's Peaker\" to the settlement that became Denver, Colorado. This move was part of a business arrangement involving his cousin Lewis N. Tappan and the then relatively unknown Henry Villard, who had both preceded him to the gold fields by a year. Sam Tappan worked as a journalist for the Daily Herald and became involved in gold and other mineral exploration and township settlement. His cousins Lewis N. Tappan (1831\u20131880), George H. Tappan (1833\u20131865), joined later in 1865 by William H. Tappan (1821\u20131907), operated Tappan & Co, one of the first general stores serving Colorado miners, with branches in Denver, Colorado City, Golden, and Central City."

He acted as witness to the treaty executed on October 7, 1863, at Conejos between the Tabeguache band of Utes under Ouray and the US government represented by Colorado Territory's Governor Evans, New Mexico Territory's Indian Superintendent Dr. Michael Steck, Indian agents Simeon Whiteley and Lafayette Head, and President Lincoln's personal representative John G. Nicolay. Tappan was later appointed by President Andrew Johnson in July 1867, pursuant to an act of the US Congress, to serve as a member of the Indian Peace Commission along with Generals William Tecumseh Sherman, William S. Harney, Alfred H. Terry, and C. C. Augur and several prominent civilians. The Commission negotiated with several tribes in the Plains during 1867\u20131868, as well as other native tribes in the Southwest. In Kansas, on October 21, 1867, the group negotiated the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the tribes of the Southern plain. He and Gen. Sherman were the two commission members who finalized the Treaty of Bosque Redondo that was signed with the Navajo Nation on June 1, 1868, at Fort Sumner, New Mexico, that ended the Bosque Redondo reservation fiasco. Tappan met several times with President Johnson and General Grant during his service with the commission, as well as many members of Congress.\nDuring his service with the commission, Tappan also recruited the young and inexperienced Henry Morton Stanley, later the famed African explorer and author, first as a clerk to cover the commission's work and later recommended that he be hired as a correspondent to file dispatches with major newspapers. Through this work, Stanley came to the attention of James Gordon Bennett, Jr. of the New York Herald, who later sent him to Africa in search of Dr. David Livingstone. Tappan also developed a lifelong friendship with the pioneer, buffalo hunter, Indian agent, illustrator and prominent Colorado artist/designer John Dare Howland, who was a clerk for the commission and later designed the Civil War monument at the Colorado Capitol building.\nTappan also vociferously protested the Washita Massacre in November 1868 of Chief Black Kettle's Southern Cheyennes while camped near Ft. Sill Oklahoma Territory by Lt. Col. George A. Custer's Seventh Cavalry troopers. Tappan was also a leading member of Peter Cooper's United States Indian Commission, founded in 1869. He promoted legislation in favor of the funding of annuities and economic assistance promised to the Indians by the federal Indian Peace Commission two years before. Tappan remained active in the cause of native rights throughout the 1870s, strongly supporting President Ulysses S. Grant's peace policy. He openly charged that the efforts of the peace policy to reach a final settlement with Plains and Southwest Indians were being undermined by congressional railroad and land speculation interests, and that these interests were ultimately responsible for such atrocities against the Indians as the 1871 massacre of Eskiminzin's Apache band at Camp Grant, Arizona."

        "content": "Following the Medicine Lodge Treaty in October 1867 which he attended as a Commissioner, Tappan adopted an orphaned Cheyenne girl whom he renamed Minnie Tappan. He made arrangements for Minnie to move back East to Boston, where she was enrolled in public school to further her education. After Tappan married the leading spiritualist Cora L.V. (Scott) Hatch Daniels (later known as Cora L.V. Richmond 1840\u20131923) and moved to Washington, DC, Minnie joined their household and continued her studies in Washington. When Tappan and his wife moved a few years later to Titusville, Pennsylvania, as part of a business venture, he made arrangements with his friend General Oliver Otis Howard for Minnie to continue her education at the Preparatory Department of what is now Howard University. While studying there in 1873, she fell ill and died and was buried in a Boston, Massachusetts, cemetery. Tappan also lived for a time during the post-War period in New York City.\nFollowing his service with the Indian Peace Commission, Tappan worked for his former associate Henry Villard at the Oregon Steamship and Railway Company during the 1870s to help systematize and encourage emigration to Oregon. He traveled during this time to Alaska and also represented Oregon at the Centennial Exposition in 1876 in Philadelphia. He later lived in California for a time. Tappan was appointed during the presidency of Chester A. Arthur to become the first superintendent of the United States Indian Industrial School in Genoa, Nebraska, in 1884\u20131885. The school was started to teach trades and educate Native Americans. Tappan served until removed by President Grover Cleveland.Tappan's marriage to Cora, who was a spiritualist medium, author, poet, abolitionist, and fellow Native American rights activist, eventually ended in divorce and they had no children together. He lived in Washington, D.C. for the last years of his life and was buried after his death at Arlington National Cemetery."

At the age of 17, he was employed as local theatre manager while also earning a law degree from Osgoode Hall.In 1934, he went into business for himself and founded 20th Century (Twinex) Theatres; by 1941, Twinex operated 17 theatres. He was then hired by Famous Players Canadian Corporation to operate an additional 25 theatres in addition to his own in order to keep him from linking up with their Canadian competition, Odeon. As head of Twentieth Century Theatres, the Ontario branch of Famous Players Canadian Corporation, he built one of the world's first cineplex movie theatres in Ottawa, Ontario at the Elgin Theatre. The Elgin's second screen opened in December 1947 on a patch of land adjacent to the original 1935 theatre. At first, the same program played in both auditoriums, but several years later Taylor came up with the idea of selling tickets to different movies from the same box office, laying claim as the first to do so. He also created one of the first movie theatres in a shopping mall (the dual-screen at Yorkdale Plaza in Toronto, Ontario, opened in 1964) and one of the first in an office building (another dual-screen, opened in 1962 in Place Ville Marie in Montreal, Quebec). By the 1970s, Taylor had entirely sold all but a few of his theatres to Famous Players, yet he started a new theatre chain from scratch, with Garth Drabinsky co-founding Cineplex Odeon cinemas. The first location in 1979 at the Toronto Eaton Centre had 18 screens (soon increased to 21), a Guinness World Record at the time.\nHe started the Canadian Film Weekly in 1941, edited by Hye Bossin. The magazine quickly became the key film trade paper in Canada, supplemented in 1951 with a yearbook for the Canadian film industry, and taking over the competing Canadian Moving Picture Digest in 1956. Taylor also distributed films, and produced of one of Canada's first horror movies The Mask. He was given a special Genie Award in 1984 for Outstanding Contributions to the Canadian Film Industry. In 1982, he received an honorary degree from York University after donating a movie theatre in his name to the school."

Other initial supporters included Vancouver's LG73 radio and Seattle's dance station C89.5FM. Top-40 radio support in both Vancouver and Seattle became a spring board for Thomas' dance music to jump to other stations and club circuits across the U.S., Canada and abroad.Thomas mixes human rights and global activism lyrics in his exploration of synth-pop music. Thomas' release  \"Calling Around the World\" is a visual and lyrical call to action, inspired by concern for environmental issues and the greater human condition. Thomas directed, edited and produced the first history documentary of Vancouver's LGBT community. Thomas' support for human rights and same sex marriage is reflected in his musical and video works, as demonstrated in his sexually and politically charged dance-pop dynamo titled \"What Our Love Is Made Of\".\"He had a big hit in the '90s with \"Total Controller\" and Thomas Donovan is still playing in the same electronica pop/dance sandbox.

After graduating in 1894, he spent two years studying piano with Theodor Leschetizky in Vienna.\nIn July 1905 he recorded ten pieces for the Welte-Mignon reproducing piano, one of the first pianists to do so. Between 1915 and 1927, he subsequently recorded at least fifteen more reproducing rolls for Duo-Art and at least five reproducing rolls for Ampico.\nOn 6 October 1909, he married Mark Twain's daughter Clara Clemens, a singer who appeared with him in recital. On 18 August 1910, their only child, Nina, was born at Mark Twain's home Stormfield in Redding, Connecticut.\nNina, the last known lineal descendant of Mark Twain, died on 16 January 1966 in a Los Angeles hotel. She had been a heavy drinker, and bottles of pills and alcohol were found in her room. Her death was ruled a suicide.From 1910 to 1914, he was conductor of the Munich Konzertverein (later known as the Munich Philharmonic). At the outbreak of World War I, he was arrested as an enemy national. Through the intervention of the nuncio to Bavaria, Archbishop Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII), Gabrilowitsch was freed from jail, and then he headed to the United States via Z\u00fcrich in August 1914.He settled in the US, and was offered the post of conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In declining, he recommended that the Boston board appoint the recently arrived Sergei Rachmaninoff. In 1918 he was appointed the founding director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, while still maintaining his life as a concert pianist. Before accepting the conductor's position, he demanded a new auditorium be built, and this was the impetus for the building of Orchestra Hall.\nGabrilowitsch composed a few works, primarily short piano pieces for his own use. He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.He died from stomach cancer on September 14, 1936 in Detroit, Michigan.

In 1552 he went back to Portugal in the suite of the Infanta Juana, wife of Jo\u00e3o Manuel, Prince of Portugal, and on the death of this prince in 1554 returned to Spain. He is said to have served in the army, to have accompanied Philip II to England in 1555, and to have travelled in Italy and the Low Countries; but it is certain that his poetical works were published at Antwerp in 1554, and again in 1558.\nHis reputation is based on a prose work, the Diana, a pastoral romance published about 1559. Shortly afterwards Montemor was killed in Piedmont, apparently in a love affair; a late edition of the Diana gives the exact date of his death. The Diana is generally stated to have been printed at Valencia in 1542; but, as the Canto de Orfeo refers to the widowhood of the Infanta Juana in 1554, the book must be of later date.\nIt is important as the first pastoral novel published in Spain; as the starting-point of a widespread literary fashion; and as the indirect source, through the translation included in Googe's Eglogs, epytaphes and sonnets (1563), of an episode in  The Two Gentlemen of Verona. Though Portuguese was Montemor's native language, he only used it for two songs and a short prose passage in the sixth book of the Diana. His mastery of Spanish is amazing, and even Miguel de Cervantes, who judges the verses in the Diana with unaccustomed severity, recognizes the remarkable merit of Montemor's prose style. That he pleased his own generation is proved by the seventeen editions and two continuations of the Diana published in the 16th century, by parodies, imitations and renderings in French and English."

To say that it is too safe in some places would be more than appropriate.\" BBC's Andy Puleston was more enthusiastic, calling it \"a sumptuous mix of styles\" that \"fuses deep house with nu jazz, downtempo and African rhythms to create a sound that is both accomplished and travelled\".

His first known individual design is the Church of the New Jerusalem, a board-and-batten Gothic Revival church built at Glendale in 1861.\nAfter serving with the Union army during the American Civil War, Mullett in 1863 relocated to Washington. He worked again with Rogers, since 1862 the de facto Supervising Architect at the Treasury Department. At that time the Treasury Department oversaw design and construction of all federal buildings. Mullett undermined his superior's position until an exasperated Rogers resigned in 1865. That year Mullet married Pacific Pearl Myrick.\nAlthough widely dismissed as \"an obscure draftsman\" from Cincinnati, Mullett used his political skills to gain appointment as Supervising Architect in 1866. He designed fireproof federal buildings across the nation, particularly custom houses, post offices and courthouses. Responsible for contracting with local architects and/or construction companies to deal with subcontractors, source materials and other matters, Mullett was known as a micromanaging authoritarian with an explosive temper.Influenced by the 1864\u20131868 remodeling of the Louvre's Pavillon de Flore  by Hector Lefuel and Richard Morris Hunt, Mullett produced six massive fortress-like Second Empire federal buildings in St. Louis, Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, New York and Washington D.C.  What was called the State, War, and Navy Building rose near the White House. These stone and cast iron structures, with mansard roofs and multiple tiers of columns, were expensive. Mullett was dogged by accusations of extravagance and subjected to five separate investigations into his ties to the corrupt \"Granite Ring\".Mullett reluctantly resigned in 1874 while under attack from reforming Treasury Secretary Benjamin Bristow and others. When three men were killed on May 1, 1877, by a floor failure at the City Hall Post Office, New York City, which had been constructed under his supervision, Mullett was investigated for negligence.\nIn 1882, he set up a practice in New York with Hugo Kafka and William G. Steinmetz, later establishing Alfred B. Mullett & Sons to practice with his two elder sons. But the government never paid him for major commissions, and he remained a popular political target. The New York Sun called him \"the most arrogant, pretentious, and preposterous little humbug in the United States.\" In 1890, in financial trouble and ill health, Mullett killed himself in Washington.Over his career he produced some 40 government buildings. Two of the six huge Second Empire buildings survive in St. Louis and Washington.  The New York City Hall Post Office was dubbed \"Mullett's monstrosity.\" Following another shift in popular taste, however, he is recognized since the late 20th century for his contribution to monumental Victorian architecture."

        "content": "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Maidana (born around 1899, died 1989) was a Bolivian film director, composer, conductor, actor, painter and dancer. He was the estranged son of a Bolivian president. He was married to Texas painter, Dorothy Hood.Le Courrier describes his portrayal of indigenous Bolivians as shaped by the assimilationist ethos of his time, but also as progressive for the era, highlighting the condition of indigenous peoples, denouncing racism, and raising the question of their role in society.Maidana is known for \"his ballets and symphonic works, a number of which embrace national/native themes\", but also for his films. He entered the cinema industry \"at the very start of Bolivian fiction film production\".\nHis first film, The Prophecy of the Lake (La profec\u00eda del lago), was made in 1925, on the heels of Bolivia's  first ever fiction feature, Pedro Sambarino's Coraz\u00f3n Aymara (1925). The Prophecy of the Lake was a contemporary love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. The film was censored, for its \"social critique\" and \"because it featured the love between a native man and a white woman\", and was never shown. Velasco Maidana subsequently started his own production company, Urania. His next two films, Wara Wara (1930) and Hacia la Gloria (1931) were released in cinema as feature films, and Wara Wara remains \"the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent-film era\". He also made short documentary films, \"before returning to music\".From then on, he worked exclusively on music, and also left Bolivia to work abroad. Among his notable ballets is Amerindia (1940).Maidana was introduced to Dorothy Hood in Mexico. He married Hood in 1946 and during that time, they traveled, following his conducting jobs which took them between Mexico City, New York and Houston, Texas.In the 1960s, Maidana had to quit conducting because he was showing signs of Parkinson's disease. He and Hood moved to Houston for better medical care. He died in Houston in 1989."

He included some of them in the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, which he edited.\nSome of her poems have been set as songs by the composer Robert Erickson.\nShe was married twice: first to John Collis, with whom she had a son, Michael, and secondly to Raymond Lovell, with whom she had a daughter, Simone Lovell. She died in 1951, when she was 44.\nDuring her marriage to Raymond Lovell she had an affair with Yeats. When they met in 1934, Yeats was 69 and Ruddock`was 27.  Their affair was conducted fitfully over the next few years. The affair broke down and Ruddock became mentally unstable. Some months later she followed Yeats (uninvited) out to the island of Majorca, where he was working with the Indian monk Shri Purohit Swami. Ruddock ended up in an asylum in Madrid from where she was rescued by Yeats and his friends, but later died in another institution, St. Ebba's Hospital in Epsom.

His father officially named him Demetrio Abdon, but his mother hated the name Abdon, and always called him Ra\u00fal Demetrio. He stopped using Ra\u00fal on the advice of Joaqu\u00edn Gallegos Lara. His father was a businessman who owned factories and farms. His maternal great-grandfather, Juan Jos\u00e9 de Malta y Salcedo, was a playwright, and the young Aguilera Malta discovered his works in the library he inherited from his grandfather. Aguilera Malta spent much of his childhood on his family's farm on an island in the Gulf of Guayaquil. He was home-schooled by his mother and tutors. He went to high school at Vicente Rocafuerte School, from which he graduated in 1929. Jos\u00e9 de la Cuadra was his literature teacher. At the beginning of his college education, he studied law in Guayaquil, but he quit these studies in 1931. Later, he studied literature on a Ministry of Education scholarship in Ecuador and in Madrid, just before the start of the Spanish Civil War.\nAmong other posts, Aguilera Malta was Undersecretary of Education and charge d'affaires in the Ecuadorian Embassy in Chile in 1947 under the government of Carlos Julio Arosemena Tola. Later, he was Cultural Attache in Brazil in 1949 and Ambassador of Ecuador to Mexico from August 1979 until his death in 1981.\nHe held conferences and courses at several universities in North and South America, including Claremont Colleges and the University of California, Irvine.\nHe was a war correspondent during the Spanish Civil War.

Son of the vicar Erich Rosenius and of Anna Wekander, he studied at the Gymnasium of Gothenburg and when he was 16 years old at Lund University under Kilian Stobaeus, and in Uppsala. In 1727, he was appointed as a lecturer at the Uppsala University, replacing Petrus Martin who had recently died. Ros\u00e9n had already worked as an assistant to professor Olof Rudbeck at the time. But he couldn't take up this position until 1731, spending those four years traveling and studying abroad in Germany, Italy, France, and the Netherlands, where he studied for a while under Friedrich Hoffmann, Herman Boerhaave and Pieter van Musschenbroek. He stayed for a year in Geneva in Switzerland with Albrecht von Haller. In 1730, Ros\u00e9n stayed in Harderwijk where he received his medical degree with his work De historiis morborum rite consignandis. He returned to Uppsala on 1 March 1731. He was at one point Carl Linnaeus's rival, who was one year younger than Ros\u00e9n. While they were working at Uppsala University, they aimed for the same position as the other. This led to a strained relationship, with Ros\u00e9n on the one hand teaching Linnaeus medicine, but on the other trying to take over the demonstrations Linnaeus gave at the botanical gardens. At one time, Ros\u00e9n had Linnaeus expelled from the university for supposedly lecturing without the necessary qualifications, after which an enraged Linnaeus tried to stab him with a sword. Eventually, they would both hold one of the chairs of medicine and cooperate on more friendly terms. In 1740, Ros\u00e9n succeeded Olof Rudbeck as professor of medicine at Uppsala University. Taking on the responsibility for the fields of physiology, anatomy, and practical medicine, while Ros\u00e9n and Linnaeus were together responsible for pathology and chemistry. Originally, they held reverse positions (Ros\u00e9n had botany, and Linnaeus anatomy and pathology), but considering their specialties and main interests, they switched places in 1742. As their mutual animosity died down they became colleagues, eventually becoming friends, with Ros\u00e9n treating Linnaeus when he suffered from the so-called \"Uppsala Fever\" or pleurisy in 1764, and Linnaeus returning the favor two years later.\nHe was First Physician to the King of Sweden by 1743, retaining this title under Frederick of Sweden, Adolf Frederick of Sweden, and Gustav III of Sweden. He was made a Knight of the Polar Star and a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and ennobled in 1762, changing his name from Nils Ros\u00e9n to Nils Ros\u00e9n von Rosenstein."

        "content": "Between 1961 and 1969 \u00d3 Riada led the Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann group. They played in concert halls dressed in black suits with white shirts and black bow ties, but relied on traditional songs and tunes. An ordinary c\u00e9ili band or show-band would have musicians who competed with each other to grab the audience's attention. Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann played sparse lucid arrangements. \u00d3 Riada sat in the middle at front playing a harpsichord and a bodhr\u00e1n, a hand-held frame-drum. This was an instrument that had almost died out, being played only by small boys in street parades. Ceil\u00ed bands generally had jazz-band drum-kits. \u00d3 Riada also wanted to use the cl\u00e1irseach or wire-strung harp in the band, but as these were as yet unavailable, he played the harpsichord instead \u2013 in his opinion the nearest sound to a cl\u00e1irseach. The harpsichord he used on a regular basis was made by Cathal Gannon. Unknown to \u00d3 Riada, Irish folk music was being played ensemble-style in London pubs, but for most people of Ireland this was the first time they heard these tunes played by a band. For some, the membership of Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann overlapped with that of The Chieftains. They recorded the soundtrack of the film Playboy of the Western World (original play by John Millington Synge) in 1962. Their last public performance was in 1969, the album was then called \"\u00d3 Riada Sa Gaiety\"."

        "content": "In 1963 \u00d3 Riada was appointed lecturer in music at University College, Cork. He moved to Baile Bh\u00fairne, and not C\u00fail Aodha (a common misconception) in West Cork, an Irish-speaking area, where he established C\u00f3r Ch\u00fail Aodha, a male voice choir. He turned toward choral church music, composing two settings of the Mass. Ceol an Aifrinn (\"Music of the Mass\") was the first Mass written in the Irish language. This featured the hymn \"Ag Cr\u00edost an S\u00edol\", which has become popular in its own right, and with such good phrasing, that it is (wrongly) thought by many today to be an ancient medieval tune. Aifreann 2 (\"Mass 2\") premiered posthumously in 1979. Further works in the \"classical\" tradition include Five Epigrams from the Greek Anthology (1958) and In memoriam Aloys G. Fleischmann (1964) to words by H\u00f6lderlin. \u00d3 Riada also set the poetry of Thomas Kinsella (Three Poems, 1954), who returned the favour by praising \u00d3 Riada in verse.\nHe became involved in Irish politics and was a friend of several influential leaders. \u00d3 Riada and his wife Ruth drank regularly at a local pub which still advertises itself as being his local."

Ralf continues to keep busy as a musician and sound engineer to this day.\nIn April 2008, he released his first ever solo album entitled \"When Aliens Meet a Drop of Water\" on the German Manikin Records label."

        "content": "When Albert Ogilvie died suddenly in 1939, 68-year-old Edmund Dwyer-Gray was elected Labor leader (and thus premier) with the understanding that he would retire after six months in office. Cosgrove was elected as his deputy, narrowly defeating Thomas D'Alton. He served as state treasurer until December 1939, when he swapped portfolios with Dwyer-Gray.During World War II, Cosgrove co-operated closely with the federal government, particularly under Labor prime ministers John Curtin and Ben Chifley. Unlike many other state premiers, he was willing to cede certain state government powers to the Commonwealth indefinitely, and was thus able to secure generous concessions and federal aid for Tasmania. He was minister administering the Hydro-Electric Commission Act for sixteen years between 1942 and 1958. He appointed himself Minister for Education in 1948, and oversaw \"an extensive school-building programme\".Cosgrove led his party to a significant victory at the 1941 state election, which saw Labor win 20 out of 30 seats. However, at all subsequent elections he and his party could muster only slim majorities. On several occasions he had to govern in minority with the support of independents. At the 1955 election, both Cosgrove's Labor Party and Rex Townley's Liberal Party won 15 seats. He was able to remain premier, but the following year one of his ministers, Carrol Bramich, defected to the Liberals. He called an early election, and won back one of the Liberals' seat to revert to the status quo of 15 seats each.In December 1947, Cosgrove was indicted on charges of bribery and corruption.  He stood down as Premier during his trial, and longtime minister Edward Brooker was sworn in as his replacement on 19 December 1947. The trial was concluded by February the next year, and Cosgrove was acquitted. Brooker stood down and Cosgrove was reinstated, appointing Brooker as Treasurer and Minister for Transport. During the 1955 Labor Party split, Cosgrove was able to prevent the large-scale defections to the Democratic Labor Party seen in other states. However, the party did split ideologically to some extent, and some individuals (notably Reg Turnbull and Brian Harradine) eventually left the party to sit as independents.Cosgrove fell ill in July 1958, and underwent surgery in Melbourne. He retired as premier on 25 August 1958, at the age of 73, and was replaced by his long-serving deputy Eric Reece, who kept Labor in power until 1969. Cosgrove was premier for 18 years and six months, the longest service in Tasmanian history. Only two other Australian state premiers have served for longer \u2013 South Australia's Thomas Playford IV (26 years) and Queensland's Joh Bjelke-Petersen (19 years), both of whom used gerrymandering to hold onto power. In 1959, Cosgrove was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG), one of the few Labor politicians to accept a knighthood."

In 1991, they formed Aftermath, a thrash metal band that played in a shed in Watkins's garden. Aftermath never recorded any material. Whilst spending time in the local Ynysangharad Park, where (17 years later) Lostprophets would headline The Full Ponty festival, Watkins was introduced to future bandmate Lee Gaze through a mutual friend. Having abandoned Aftermath, which made two live appearances in its lifespan of two years, Watkins and Gaze decided to form a new band called Fleshbind, based on their American hardcore punk influences. The band played several shows, including one supporting Feeder in London, but the group was short-lived.Watkins reunited with Mike Lewis as a drummer in a hardcore band called Public Disturbance, formed in 1995. By this time, Watkins and Gaze had left Fleshbind to create their own band, Lost Prophets, who made their live debut in May 1997 alongside Public Disturbance, with Watkins as the lead vocalist. In 1998, Watkins left Public Disturbance to concentrate on the newly named lostprophets (all lower-case letters).\nIn 2003, Watkins was featured on the Hoobastank song \"Out of Control\" along with Jamie Oliver, who was by then a member of Lostprophets.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2008, Watkins took part in a concert for Kidney Wales Foundation and stated that his reasons for being involved were as a result of his mother needing a kidney transplant: \"Having that direct experience is why I wanted to get more involved with Kidney Wales and organise a fundraising concert on New Year's Eve.\" The concert featured Welsh bands the Blackout, Kids in Glass Houses, and Attack! Attack!Watkins was also featured on the Blackout's song \"It's High Tide Baby!\" from their debut studio album We Are the Dynamite (2007), and also accompanied them on tour.\nIn 2009, Watkins started a remixing side project called \"L'Amour La Morgue\". He released 17 remixes by artists such as the Killers, Beyonc\u00e9, Young Guns, Tears for Fears, and Bring Me the Horizon. He also released a free mixtape, which was available online, along with a free download of a song that was premiered at a fashion show in 2008.Lostprophets released five studio albums: The Fake Sound of Progress (2000), Start Something (2004), Liberation Transmission (2006), The Betrayed (2010), and Weapons (2012).

        "content": "Watkins' abuse and misconduct with children was reported as early as 2008 to South Wales Police, though the authorities repeatedly failed to act upon any leads linking Watkins to these allegations. Around 2006 or so, whilst on tour in support of the band's third studio album, Liberation Transmission, multiple band members and road crew employees recalled seeing Watkins backstage with multiple underage fans. Watkins' former bandmates claimed they were unaware of his conduct as his drug use had begun to cause heavy strain on his relationship with them. Watkins had requested his own private dressing room away from the other five band members, where much of his abuse of children allegedly took place. Watkins had also chosen to minimize personal contact with most of his bandmates, spending more of his time at his residence in Wales during much of their off-time, while the rest of his bandmates resided in Los Angeles. Bassist Stuart Richardson recalled during a December 2019 interview the tensions escalating into an altercation with Watkins after he failed to show up for a show:\n\nI come off the stage, fucking livid. Go on the bus, Ian's on the bus. And I'm like 'nice one'. And he gives me some shit. And I black the fuck out and I'm laying punches into his face. I'm not fucking proud of it. But I'm laying punches into his face for 10 seconds or 10 minutes. I don't know. And I'm a big boy compared to him, so I'm not proud of this. And then he gives me this fucking look after I hit him. I had this can of Monster Energy in my hand and I smashed this fucking can into his head. And I'm like 'fuck', I go outside and puke. And for the next three weeks he's like black eyes, cut on his face and I'm like feeling fucking horrible about the whole thing. And that's what I did when he missed a show.\n\nJoanne Mjadzelics, an ex-girlfriend of Watkins, recalls him displaying multiple graphic images with minors or drug paraphernalia as early as 2010. Appalled by the content, Mjadzelics had made multiple complaints to South Wales Police, though very little action was taken at the time. Mjadzelics was one of six people who had spoken to the police in regards to Watkins' conduct from 2008 to 2011. In 2010, an Australian woman had also come forward accusing Watkins of assaulting her child, though the allegations were not investigated any further by authorities. During the recording of the band's fourth studio album, The Betrayed, in 2009, Mjadzelics was made aware by Watkins that he was abusing a two-year-old child in California whilst the band was recording in Los Angeles. Mjadzelics contacted the child's parents, who had also reported him to Welsh authorities, though again, no further action was taken to investigate the matter."

He is a great grandson of D. S. Senanayake (Sri Lanka's \"Father of the Nation\") and cousin of Ruwan Wijewardene.Senanayake was appointed State Minister of Foreign Affairs in the United National Party led national government on May 31, 2017. He was the State Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management from 2015 to 2017. He was the Deputy Minister of Tourism and Sports in the United National Party 100 days government. Senanayake served as acting Foreign Minister when the Minister Ravi Karunanayake resigned on 10 August 2017. Vasantha Senanayake as state minister foreign affairs developed a close friendship with Lord Naseby of the UK House of Lords and supported vociferously the English Peer's condemnation of the characterization of the war and the Sri Lankan military.During the 2018 Sri Lanka constitutional crisis, Senanayake, a Member of Parliament elected on the United National Party's Polonnaruwa District ticket in 2015, switched his alliance on multiple occasions between the two political parties that were battling for power. Initially he pledged his support for Mahinda Rajapaksa who appointed him as Minister of Tourism and Wildlife after controversially dismissing prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Senanayake then returned his alliance to the United National Party, announcing his resignation from his ministerial portfolio, but later supported Rajapaksa again. This turbulence which Senanayake faced in his second term in Parliament moving between the UNP, the party of his ancestors and the Rajapakse camp may be attributed to his dilemma. Which can be attributed to him of wanting to belong to the \u2018Old UNP\u2019 but fiercely attempting to resist and depose its present occupant and leader of four decades Ranil Wickremasinghe. Wickremasinghe remains in office today after leading the UNP to its worst ever defeat in which the party secured no elected seats and Wickremasinghe scrambled in on a single National List seat the party had secured. He went on to be appointed president of Sri Lanka following the peoples uprising and Gotabhaya Rajapaksha\u2019s resignation in 2022.Senanayake suggested early in his parliamentary career that the imposition of an overly powerful executive presidency on a Westminster type parliament was likely to cause repercussions in Parliament's role, human rights and national policy and rule of law. He submitted a model constitution for the reflections of the select committee. In parliament he has been an active lobbyist against the alcohol and tobacco industries. He has been espousing the importance of transforming modern sri lanka in to a commercial trading hub giving emphasis to sri lanka\u2019s geographical position. Senanayake also established strong contacts with many countries and world leaders during his tenure in the foreign ministry.Senanayake did not contest for election in 2020, and has been spending much of his time writing. His first published book 'Transcending Sita' has been well received."

        "content": "He was born in Bologna about 1050.\nAt the urging of Countess Matilda of Tuscany he began to devote himself to the study of jurisprudence, taking the Justinian code as a guide. After teaching jurisprudence for a short while in Rome he returned to Bologna, where he founded a new school of jurisprudence in 1084 or 1088, which would rival the law school of Ravenna.\nSome jurisprudence had been taught at Bologna, before Irnerius founded his school, by Pepo and a few others, and a tradition of jurisprudence had developed at Pavia since the mid-ninth century. He introduced the custom of explaining the Roman law by means of glosses, which originally were meagre interlinear elucidations of the text. But since the glosses were often too extensive to be inserted between the lines of the text, he began to write them on the margin of the page, thus being the first to introduce the marginal glosses which afterwards came into general use.\n\nAfter the death of Pope Paschal II, he defended the rights of Emperor Henry V in the papal election and upheld the legality of the election of the imperial antipope Gregory VIII. After 1116 he appears to have held some office under the emperor. He died, perhaps during the reign of the emperor Lothair II, but certainly before 1140."

Thus he was the first of the glossators, whose explications of the law became an essential part of the legal curriculum.\nThe text of Justinian's Pandects used in Bologna, referred to as the Littera Bononiensis, closely parallel to the Littera Florentina, would be disseminated throughout Europe as students returned home from Bologna: there are versions of the Bolognese Littera with provenances in Paris, Padua, Leipzig and at the Vatican (Purpura 2001)."

As his father's grandparents were Jewish, he was also considered Jewish and at risk of being sent to concentration camps. In an interview with Adam Spencer, Nossal noted that his father was not a professing Jew but of Jewish ethnicity as he had been baptised a Roman Catholic as a child. Nossal remarked that his father \"therefore thought that he would be somewhat protected from the Holocaust-type predicament. Of course, he hadn't properly read Mein Kampf. It was all spelt out there: if your four grandparents were Jewish, then you were Jewish.\" He was baptised and remains a practising Roman Catholic.Nossal showed interest in medicine and wanted to become a doctor since the age of seven. When he first attended school in Australia, Nossal spoke no English\nbut he graduated from St Aloysius' College in 1947\nas the dux of the college. In 1948, he entered the Sydney Medical School, graduating later with first-class honours from the University of Sydney.

It deals with hypotheses of which you can at least say \"this is not patently false.\" But the human experience, on the other hand, does not just deal with verifiable facts.

All that is known of him is from the Gesta regum Anglorum (Deeds of the English Kings), written by the eminent medieval historian William of Malmesbury in about 1125. Being a fellow monk of the same abbey, William almost certainly obtained his account directly from people who knew Eilmer when he was an old man.Later scholars, such as the American historian of technology Lynn White, have attempted to estimate Eilmer's date of birth based on a quotation in William's Deeds about Halley's Comet, which appeared in 1066. However, William recorded Eilmer's quotation not to establish his age, but to show that a prophecy was fulfilled when the Normans invaded England.\n\nYou've come, have you? \u2013 You've come, you source of tears to many mothers. It is long since I saw you; but as I see you now you are much more terrible, for I see you brandishing the downfall of my country.\nIf Eilmer had seen Halley's Comet 76 years earlier in 989, he could have been born about 984, making him about five or six years old when he first saw the comet, and therefore old enough to remember it. However the periodicity of comets was probably unknown in Eilmer's time, and so his remark \"It is long since I saw you\" could have referred to a different, later comet. Since it is known that Eilmer was an \"old man\" in 1066, and that he had made the flight attempt \"in his youth\", the event is placed some time during the early 11th century, perhaps in its first decade.Beyond those based on William's account, there are no other known sources documenting Eilmer's life."

Thus, Eilmer fixed wings to his hands and feet and launched himself from the top of a tower at Malmesbury Abbey:\n\nHe was a man learned for those times, of ripe old age, and in his early youth had hazarded a deed of remarkable boldness. He had by some means, I scarcely know what, fastened wings to his hands and feet so that, mistaking fable for truth, he might fly like Daedalus, and, collecting the breeze upon the summit of a tower, flew for more than a furlong [201 metres]. But agitated by the violence of the wind and the swirling of air, as well as by the awareness of his rash attempt, he fell, broke both his legs and was lame ever after. He used to relate as the cause of his failure, his forgetting to provide himself a tail.\nGiven the geography of the abbey, his landing site, and the account of his flight, to travel for \"more than a furlong\" (220 yards, 201 metres) he would have had to have been airborne for about 15 seconds. His exact flightpath is not known, nor how long he was in the air, because today's abbey is not the abbey of the 11th century, when it was probably smaller, although the tower was probably close to the present height. \"Olivers Lane\", off the present-day High Street and about 200 metres (660 ft) from the abbey, is reputed locally to be the site where Eilmer landed. That would have taken him over many buildings. Maxwell Woosnam's study concluded that he is more likely to have descended the steep hill off to the southwest of the abbey, rather than the town centre to the south.Eilmer used a bird-like apparatus to glide downwards against the breeze. However, being unable to balance himself forward and backwards, as does a bird by slight movements of its wings, head and legs, he would have needed a large tail to maintain equilibrium. Eilmer could not have achieved true soaring flight, but he might have glided down safely with a tail. Eilmer said he had \"forgotten to provide himself with a tail.\""

These include over the years: Helinand of Froidmont (before 1229), Alberic of Trois-Fontaines (before 1241), Vincent of Beauvais (1250s), Roger Bacon (c. 1260), Ranulf Higden (before 1352, and the first to misname him \"Oliver\") and the English translators of his work: Henry Knighton (before 1367), John Nauclerus of T\u00fcbingen (c. 1500), John Wilkins (1648), John Milton (1670), and John Wise (1850).More recently, Maxwell Woosnam in 1986 examined in more detail the technical aspects such as materials, glider angles, and wind effects.Contemporaries had developed small drawstring toy helicopters, windmills, and sails for boats while church artists increasingly showed angels with more accurate bird-like wings, detailing the camber (curvature) that would help develop lift for heavier-than-air flight. Air was accepted as something that could be \"worked\", and some people believed that humans could fly with physical effort and the right equipment. Still, for the monk Eilmer the idea of flight must have had a spiritual significance as well: he would not have been ignorant of the need to guard and stabilize the soul for its flight in the afterlife; the differences between angelic and human bodies; the weight of sin and the unnaturalness of ascending mortal flesh."

He was a recipient of a John D. Rockefeller III Grant to study filmmaking at the New York University and film archiving at the Library of Congress Film Archives in Washington, DC and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A British Council Grant led to further film studies and training in film archiving at the British Film Institute.\nAguiluz worked in various capacities in film projects with other important Filipino directors his senior, including National Artist Lino Brocka. He first made his mark with the 15-minute documentary Mt. Banahaw, Holy Mountain. The film won a Silver Trophy at the prestigious Young Filmmakers of Asia Festival in Iran.\nAguiluz plunged into the full-length feature in 1984 with the acclaimed Boatman. It was exhibited at the 1985 London Film Festival where it was cited as the outstanding film of the year. It was followed several years later, in 1995, by his own version of the story of the ill-fated household helper Flor Contemplacion in the equally acclaimed docu-drama entitled Bagong Bayani, OCW.\nIn 1996, his film Segurista (Dead Sure) was picked as the official Philippine entry to the Academy Awards for the Best Foreign-Language Film category. It placed 12th in the list of thirty-nine titles. The same film won the Best Director award for Aguiluz at the Gawad Urian (the local film critics award), as well as the Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Production Design and Best Supporting Actor plums, the last for actor Albert Martinez who played the title role. Segurista toured international film festivals in Toronto, Singapore and others.\nAguiluz's next film project was originally intended to be a biographical film about Filipino revolutionary Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio, to be titled Ang Supremo: The Life of Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio with Caloocan mayor Rey Malonzo cast in the title role, but the project did not come to fruition. Rizal sa Dapitan (1997), was a historical film on the Philippine national hero's poignant exile in Dapitan. It captured the majority of awards at the Philippine Movie Press Club's Star Awards and the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences Annual Awards. The film was also shown at the First Philippine International Film Festival, at the Toronto International Film Festival, in Mar del Plata, Argentina and in Singapore. It continues its tour of world film capitals under the auspices of the Culture Committee of the UNESCO National Commission of the Philippines. When it competed at the Brussels International Film Festival (Festival International du Film Independent), it was conferred the Grand Jury Prize in addition to the best actor award for lead star Martinez.\nAguiluz served on the jury of the film festivals in Berlin, Pusan (South Korea), Singapore, Vesoul (France), Delhi, and Kerala in India, among others. He was the chief creative force behind the highly successful Cinemanila International Film Festival.\nIn 2003, the French government awarded Aguiluz the Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres prize for his contributions to Philippine cinema.\nIn 2013, the documentary film The Search for Weng Weng started its film festival run. In it Aguiluz was interviewed about the actor Weng Weng who was the Philippines' first international star and a unique figure in cinema, being a short person who performs death defying stunts.On January 8, 2015, Aguiluz directorial effort Tragic Theater was released. The film is a supernatural horror film adaptation of the book of the same name, starring Andi Eigenmann, Christopher de Leon and John Estrada.Aguiluz died on February 18, 2024, at the age of 76."

His father, Pasicrates, seems to have bestowed great care on his son Dio's education. At first he lived in Prusa, where he held important offices, composed speeches and other rhetorical and sophistical essays, and studied philosophy. The Stoic and Platonist philosophies, however, appear to have had the greatest charms for him, particularly the stoicism of Musonius Rufus.\nHe went to Rome during Vespasian's reign (69\u201379 AD), by which time he seems to have got married and had a child. He became a critic of the Emperor Domitian, who banished him from Rome, Italy, and Bithynia in 82 for advising one of the Emperor's conspiring relatives. He claims that, on the advice of the Delphic oracle, he put on the clothes of a beggar, and with nothing in his pocket but a copy of Plato's Phaedo and Demosthenes's On the False Embassy, he lived the life of a Cynic philosopher, undertaking a journey to the countries in the north and east of the Roman empire. He thus visited Thrace, Mysia, Scythia, and the country of the Getae, giving orations.He was a friend of Nerva, and when Domitian was murdered in 96 AD, Dio used his influence with the army stationed on the frontier in favour of Nerva. Under Emperor Nerva's reign, his exile was ended, and he was able to return home to Prusa. He adopted the surname Cocceianus, reflecting Nerva's nomen, Cocceius. Dio addressed his four Orations on Kingship to Nerva's successor, Trajan, and appears to have known the Emperor personally, claiming \"I am perhaps as well acquainted with your character as anyone.\" He knew Apollonius of Tyana and Euphrates of Tyre. In his later life Dio had considerable status in Prusa, and Pliny the Younger reports that he was involved in a lawsuit about a civic building project around 111. He probably died a few years later."

        "content": "Dio Chrysostom was part of the Second Sophistic school of Greek philosophers which reached its peak in the early 2nd century during the Antonine period. He was considered one of the most eminent of the Greek rhetoricians and sophists by the ancients who wrote about him, such as Philostratus, Synesius, and Photius. This is confirmed by the eighty orations of his which are still extant, and which were the only ones known in the time of Photius. These orations appear to be written versions of his oral teaching, and are like essays on political, moral, and philosophical subjects. They include four orations on Kingship addressed to Trajan on the virtues of a sovereign; four on the character of Diogenes of Sinope, on the troubles to which men expose themselves by deserting the path of Nature, and on the difficulties which a sovereign has to encounter; essays on slavery and freedom; on the means of attaining eminence as an orator; political discourses addressed to various towns which he sometimes praises and sometimes blames, but always with moderation and wisdom; on subjects of ethics and practical philosophy, which he treats in a popular and attractive manner; and lastly, orations on mythical subjects and show-speeches. He argued strongly against permitting prostitution. Two orations of his (37 and 64) are now assigned to Favorinus. Besides the eighty orations we have fragments of fifteen others, and there are extant also five letters under Dio's name.\nHe wrote many other philosophical and historical works, none of which survives. One of these works, Getica, was on the Getae, which the Suda incorrectly attributes to Dio Cassius."

His father Frank, who was a founder-member of Fianna F\u00e1il, and his mother Delia Costello, both died in 1931. As a result, he was raised by an uncle and aunt. His brother Fergus (Patrick) Barrett OFM, became a Franciscan priest, and founding rector of St John Vianney Seminary, Pretoria, South Africa. Barrett was educated at Ballyea National School and St Flannan's College in Ennis. He studied engineering at University College Galway, though did not complete his studies. He was a cadet in the Irish Army and later worked as a rate collector and an auctioneer.He was elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 14 March 1968 at the by-election in the Clare constituency, held following the death of Fine Gael TD William Murphy. Barrett topped the poll at the general election the following year. At the 1973 general election Fianna F\u00e1il lost office to a Fine Gael\u2013Labour Party coalition government under Liam Cosgrave, and Barrett was appointed to the party's front bench as spokesperson on Transport and Power. After Fianna F\u00e1il's landslide victory at the 1977 general election he was appointed to the cabinet as Minister for the Environment.\nBarrett supported George Colley in the 1979 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election. Charles Haughey was the eventual victor, but Barrett was retained in the cabinet in the Environment position. Following a reshuffle in 1980 he was appointed Minister for Defence. After the February 1982 general election Fianna F\u00e1il were returned to office, but Barrett was not appointed to cabinet. However, he was appointed a Minister of State at the Department of Finance.\nIn October 1982, when Charlie McCreevy put down a motion of no confidence in Haughey's leadership, Barrett was the only Minister of State among the so-called Gang of 22 who supported it; Haughey survived, and did not dismiss Barrett from office.The following month he topped the poll at the November 1982 general election. Fianna F\u00e1il were out of government again, and Barrett was appointed to the front bench as spokesperson on Defence. He remained there until 1984, when he won a seat in the Munster constituency at the European Parliament election and was replaced on the front bench by Noel Treacy. He did not contest either the 1987 general election or the 1989 European Parliament election, and retired from politics. He died on 8 May 2002."

The joint premiers for Canada West during this period were William Henry Draper (1846 to 1847) and then Henry Sherwood (1847).\nPapineau was part of the interconnected Papineau, Viger, and Cherrier families, who were politically active during the early to mid-19th century in Lower Canada (now Quebec).  His father, Joseph Papineau, and his uncle, Andr\u00e9 Papineau, had both been members of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada.  His older brother, Louis-Joseph Papineau, was a leader of the Patriote movement leading up to the Lower Canada Rebellion. A cousin, Andr\u00e9-Benjamin Papineau, had also been a Patriote member of the Assembly.   Another cousin, Denis-Benjamin Viger, was also involved in the Patriote movement, and later served as joint premier of the Province of Canada.\nUnlike his brother and cousins, Papineau was not politically active during the lead-up to the Rebellion.  It was not until 1842 that he entered politics, when he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in a by-election, as the member for Ottawa County, Canada East. Two years later, in 1844, Viger invited Papineau to join his new government.  Papineau became the Commissioner of Crown Lands with a seat in the Executive Council. When Viger withdrew from politics in 1846, Papineau succeeded him as joint premier from Canada East. Papineau in turn retired from politics late in 1847.\nPrior to his political career, Papineau was involved in various commercial activities. He was the manager of the family seigneury of Petite-Nation, first for his father, then for his brother Louis-Joseph. He also had a share in a bookstore in Montreal, and some commercial activities in the Petit-Nation area. He was the postmaster for Petit-Nation, and had several term appointments as a justice of the peace in the Montreal district. \nAfter withdrawing from politics, Papineau retired to Petite-Nation, where he died in 1854."

His father was a successful surveyor and notary, and a member of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada.  He had risen into the seigneurial class by buying the seigneury of Petite-Nation (now located in the Papineau Regional County Municipality in western Quebec, on the Ottawa River). Denis-Benjamin's older brother, Louis-Joseph Papineau, was also elected to the Legislative Assembly and became the major leader of the Parti canadien (later known as the Parti patriote), leading up to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837.Like his older brother, Denis-Benjamin studied at the Petit S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, from 1801 to 1807.

        "content": "Unlike his father and his brother, Papineau did not train as a lawyer.  Instead, starting in 1808, he oversaw the operation of the seigneury of Petite-Nation, first for his father Joseph, and later for his brother, Louis-Joseph, who bought the seigneury from their father in 1817.  His tasks included encouraging settlement into the area and developing the lumber trade and sawmills, in the rich timber area of the Ottawa River valley.  His correspondence with his father during this period indicate that his father criticised him for his business decisions.  He continued to manage the seigneury for his brother, including the period when Louis-Joseph was in exile after the Rebellion.  Louis-Joseph sent letters to Denis-Benjamin, criticising him for not collecting enough rents from the tenants.Papineau tried to develop a horse-breeding business, but without success.  He had greater success with sheep, at one point building up a flock of over 200 sheep. In 1822, he became a seigneur in his own right, buying the fief of Plaisance, located near Petit-Nation, but he was forced to sell part of it a few years later because of financial difficulties.As part of the efforts to encourage settlement, Papineau was involved in developing the parish and municipality in the area.  In 1821, the vicar general of the diocese of Montreal, Jean-Jacques Lartigue (another of Papineau's cousins), issued an order permitting the erection of a chapel dedicated to Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours. Ten years later, Papineau and seventy-five other residents sent a petition to the Bishop of Quebec for the creation of a parish.  The bishop granted the request, with a recommendation that the residents also seek the creation of a civil parish.  In 1845, the Governor General of the Province of Canada issued an order creating a number of civil parishes based on existing ecclesiastical parishes, including the new municipality of Notre-Dame-des-Bonsecours.Papineau was involved in merchant activities in the Petit-Nation area, and served as the postmaster for the region. He was a partner in a Montreal bookstore, and was named a justice of the peace for Montreal district on several occasions."

        "content": "Papineau was not politically active as a young man, unlike his older brother and several cousins, who were involved in the Patriote movement and had been members of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada leading up to the Rebellion. It was not until the formation of the Province of Canada in 1841, merging Lower Canada with Upper Canada (now Ontario), that Papineau became involved in politics.  In 1842, he was elected in a by-election in the electoral constituency of Ottawa County, on the Lower Canada side of the Ottawa River.  In the Assembly, he joined the French-Canadian Group, a parliamentary caucus which generally opposed the government of the Governor General.  Papineau's cousin Denis-Benjamin Viger was initially one of the leaders of the Group.Papineau entered politics just as a political crisis was brewing, which eventually led to him becoming joint premier. In 1843, all but one of the members of the Executive Council, led by Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine and Robert Baldwin, resigned in protest at actions taken by Governor General Charles Metcalfe, without consulting the Council. The Assembly passed a resolution criticising Metcalfe and supporting LaFontaine and Baldwin. The vote on the resolution revealed a split in the French-Canadian Group.  While most of the members of the Group, including Papineau, supported LaFontaine and voted for the resolution, two of the older members of the Group, Viger and John Neilson, supported Metcalfe and voted against the resolution.  The result was a surprise, since Viger and Neilson had a long history of opposing the governors prior to the Rebellion.Metcalfe then appointed Viger as joint premier, along with a moderate Tory from Upper Canada, William Draper.  However, they lacked political support from the Assembly. Almost a year went by without additional appointments to the Council.  Finally, in September 1844, Viger and Draper were able to persuade some members of the Assembly to be appointed to the Council.  One of them was Papineau, who accepted the office of Commissioner of Crown Lands.  Governor General Metcalfe and Viger hoped that appointing Papineau would gain support from French-Canadians, given the political strength of his family. Metcalfe then dissolved Parliament and called new elections.The elections did not go well for the government.  LaFontaine was now the clear leader of the French-Canadian Group. Viger and Neilson were both defeated in their own ridings, and LaFontaine and his supporters won a strong majority of the seats from Canada East.  Papineau was one of the few members of the government in Canada East who was re-elected. After the elections, Governor General Metcalfe kept the Viger\u2013Draper ministry in office, supported primarily by Draper and the Tories, who had won a majority of the seats in Upper Canada.Instead of gaining support for the government, Papineau's appointment to the Council furthered the split in the French-Canadian Group.  His own brother, Louis-Joseph Papineau, had earlier been critical of anyone who took an appointment from the governor, saying: \"One cannot accept a position as minister and remain an honourable man.\" Louis-Joseph, now in exile in Paris, refused to endorse the new government, even with his brother as a member. Viger and Denis-Benjamin Papineau were considered to be Tories, supporting the governor.Denis-Benjamin Papineau did not help his reputation with French-Canadians by his first vote in the Assembly after the 1844 elections.  In the election of the new Speaker, he voted for Allan MacNab, a unilingual Family Compact Tory from Upper Canada. Nor did Papineau appear to have a firm grasp of parliamentary procedure, contradicting one of his own government colleagues during the debate on the speech from the throne.  He was also hampered by his own deafness, making it difficult for him to follow the debates.He did win some support by introducing an address to Queen Victoria, requesting that the statutory restrictions on the use of French in the Assembly be lifted, but he also attracted further criticism for introducing legislation to reorganise the schools and municipalities, triggering opposition from the Catholic church and landowners.  Another controversial position was his support for compensation for residents in Upper Canada who had their property damaged during the Rebellion, while not bringing in a similar compensation system for residents of Lower Canada. In light of Viger's failure to earn political support in Lower Canada, Draper began to make overtures to other French-Canadian politicians, suggesting that Viger and Papineau might both retire from politics to make way for others.  Papineau was aware of the negotiations and appeared willing to retire, but Draper's efforts did not bear fruit.  Viger remained in office for another year, until June 1846, when he  retired from politics, resigning his leadership position in the ministry.  Papineau took over as the leader of the Canada East members in the Council.  At first he was paired with Draper, who continued as leader of the Canada West members, but Draper resigned a year later, in May 1847.  Draper's position was taken by Henry Sherwood, a Family Compact Tory from Toronto.  There was considerable turnover in the membership of the Executive Council in the eighteen months after Viger's retirement (including the addition of a young John A. Macdonald in 1847).  Not much was achieved by the ministry before Parliament was dissolved in December 1847.  Papineau resigned his seat in the Executive Council at that time, and did not stand for re-election in the general elections that followed."

His father, Sare King Wong, was born and raised in Guangdong province, and later moved to Shanghai as a news journalist. His mother Alice was a devout Christian who took the family to the First Chinese Baptist Church every week. Wong was one of five children; his siblings were Sarah Wong Lum, Zeppelin Wong, and twins Shirley Wong Frentzel and Betty Wong Brown. Sare King Wong's grandfather had founded the  Young China newspaper with Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Victor Wong was fluent with both English and Cantonese, which helped lead his acting career to Hong Kong.Wong and his family moved to Courtland, California when he was two years old after his father took a job as teacher and principal at a school for the children of local Chinese laborers. The family would move back to Chinatown within three years and his father was active in local politics. He would live in Sacramento, California for much of his adult life.Wong studied political science and journalism at the University of California, Berkeley and theology at the University of Chicago under Paul Tillich, Reinhold Niebuhr and Martin Buber. In Chicago, Wong joined The Second City comedy troupe and stayed with Langston Hughes. Wong returned to San Francisco for the summer, taking part in a theatre production and never returning to Chicago; he resumed his studies at the San Francisco Art Institute under Mark Rothko, earning a master's degree in 1962."

Kennedy to pursue a career in journalism, landing an on-air role for KQED's Newsroom, where he won a Regional Emmy, from 1968 until 1974, when he was stricken with Bell's palsy.During his tenure on Newsroom, Wong is credited with inventing the photojournalistic essay, covering stories with his still camera and returning to narrate them in the studio. The palsy would give him his later distinctive appearance, but at the time, he felt his roles had diminished because he wasn't \"pretty looking\"."

The independent filmmaker and fellow San Franciscan first cast him in the lead role of his 1985 film Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart, and went on to include him in Eat a Bowl of Tea and Life Is Cheap... But Toilet Paper Is Expensive (both 1989), and The Joy Luck Club (1993). Wang later called Wong his role model for living life.\n\nHe retired from acting in 1998 after suffering two strokes.

He proceeded to teach himself guitar and jazz improvisation and attended the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany for a brief period.\nFor the release of Mastertouch, he collaborated with Michael Brecker, Billy Cobham, Kai Eckhardt, Ernie Watts, Alphonse Mouzon, Hellmut Hattler, Joachim K\u00fchn and various other instrumentalists, setting a new standard for young musicians both in regard to its open minded eclecticism and its high level of transatlantic musical cooperation, subsequently followed by many younger artists such as trumpeter Till Br\u00f6nner.Upon an invitation by Steve Smith and Tom Coster, members of platinum-selling groups Santana and Journey, de Winkel become successor to Mike Stern and Frank Gambale in their co-led jazz-fusion group Vital Information and proceeded to tour internationally with this group. He accepted a full scholarship from the Berklee College of Music in Boston and graduated summa cum laude. In the 1990s, he collaborated with an unusually broad spectrum of artists including Pat Metheny (DVD Secret Story Live), Al Foster, Larry Grenadier, Matthew Garrison, Ravi Coltrane, Joe Zawinul, Grandmaster Flash, and more recently Gwilym Simcock and Stuart Hamm. He can also be heard on all ten CDs of the German vanguard electronica-jazz fusion duo Tab Two and continues to tour and record with Hattler, the group of former Kraan head Hellmut Hattler.

Since, he has been active in various projects in Europe, Africa and Asia as well as in non-profit organizations exploring sustainability and globalization issues in the context of the arts.\nDisenchanted with the common chord scale theory didactics, de Winkel has developed an alternative approach to teaching improvisation. Under the title Training Intuition this approach considers recent developments in learning psychology and in the neurosciences. De Winkel has conducted courses, master classes and clinics at various institutions, among them the Musikhochschule Hamburg and the Berufsfachschule f\u00fcr Musik in Krumbach/Schwaben. De Winkel is also active in the field of neurophilosophy.\nIn 2005, Torsten de Winkel was one of the initiators and has since been the artistic director of the Bimbache openART Festival and Initiative in UNESCO world biosphere reserve El Hierro (Spain). This project, based on a global interdisciplinary network of artists and thinkers, is an ambitious and non-profit effort at creating a platform which seeks to bridge traditional divides, both on a musical and human level, in a globalized world."

        "content": "When Koyasu was in junior high school, he, as an aspiring screen actor himself, was such a movie buff that he would watch movies every day without going to school. By chance, he saw the scene before Tetsur\u014d Hoshino's departure in Adieu Galaxy Express 999 where a group of nameless soldiers take him on the 999 and send him on his way, and was impressed by it. This sparked his interest in voice acting, and since then it has been his policy to aim for \"three-dimensional acting.\" After graduating from high school, he entered a training school. In 1988, he made his voice acting debut in Wowser, and in 1989, he played his first regular character as Gai, the King Yaksha in Legend of Heavenly Sphere Shurato. Although he was a regular character in the series, he was in the position of a villain whose inner workings were rarely discussed in the story, so it was difficult for Koyasu to grasp the role and he had to do several dozen retakes for a single line. He later said that although his name recognition as a voice actor had increased, he did not feel like he was doing his best.\nAfterwards, Koyasu played the role of Minos in the OVA Aries released in 1990. The OVA was based on a fantasy manga of the same name that was being serialized at the time, and the voice actors for the main characters were to be decided by a magazine reader's vote. Since Koyasu had appeared in Shurato shortly before this, he had some recognition among the viewers, and he received the most votes for the role of Hades, the main character. However, at the time, Koyasu was still an unknown name in the voice acting industry, and the production members voiced their concerns about giving the lead role to a newcomer like Koyasu. As a result, the results of the readers' poll were rejected, and Koyasu was given the role of Hades' subordinate Minos, a role with little screentime.In Tekkaman Blade, Koyasu played the main character's rival, Tekkaman Evil (Shinya Aiba). Koyasu himself has often said in interviews that this is his favorite character, and after a period of sluggish performance, he put his voice acting career on the line to play the role, which ultimately led to his recovery. He also said that when he was playing the character, he thought he was really great, but when he watched the footage again later in life, he thought he was terrible at it, which led him to believe he was making progress.In the late 1990s, Koyasu worked on conceptualizing for the media franchise Wei\u00df Kreuz. He also formed the voice acting unit \"Wei\u00df\" consisting of voice castmates Shin-ichiro Miki, Tomokazu Seki and Hiro Y\u016bki, and became the first male voice actor to appear on the cover of a voice acting magazine and the first voice actor to make a music clip. In 2000\u20132001, he was active in music under the name ZAZEL.After working as a member of Production Baobab (1988\u20131998), Koyasu established his own representative office, T's Factory, in 1998. On May 5, 2020, on the occasion of his birthday, the official website and Twitter account of T's Factory were opened, and his profile was also released at the same time.\nIn 2020, Koyasu made his first appearance with his son, voice actor K\u014dki Koyasu, in an advertisement for Duel Masters. In April, he and K\u014dki teamed up for their own radio show, \"Takehito & K\u014dki's KOYASU RADIO.\"In 2021, he won the Best Actor in Supporting Role award at the 15th Seiyu Awards.Koyasu's name \"Takehito\" comes from the fact that his birthday is on Children's Day. His motto is to \"make two-dimensional into three-dimensional.\" His hobby is writing novels and he professes to like video games. He has played every game he has appeared in, but he is not very good at action or shooting games."

He is most notable as a constant attendant at the court of Peter III and Alfonso III of Aragon. He may be the same person as the Peironet who composed poems with Peter III.\nSalvatge wrote the third piece in a five-piece cycle of sirventes written in Summer 1285. Early in the summer Bernart d'Auriac inaugurated the political debate by coming to the defence of the \"three kings\" Philip III of France, Philip of Navarre, and Charles of Valois, who claimed the Crown of Aragon. Under the direction of the French king they invaded Catalonia in the so-called \"Aragonese Crusade\". After Peter III of Aragon responded to Bernart, Pere responded to Peter in the short piece Senher, reys qu'enamoratz par.\nPere appears to have gotten his nickname from his occupation as a caballero salvaje or cavaller salvatge in the king's house. As such, he acted as messenger and herald. Among his duties was directing the battle cry when the king's armies went to war. Pere is first mentioned by name in 1280 as a juglar del rey (\"jongleur of the king\"). In April 1286 he was charged with distributing compensation in precious metal and money to the other jongleurs who had assisted in Peter's coronation (in 1276). He was still alive in June 1287 when Alfonso III ordered proceedings against some men accused of kidnapping Pere's daughter."

He lived at 14 Andrew Road on the Bustleholme Mill estate in West Bromwich, West Midlands, England with his elderly parents, Hilda and Horrace, who owned and ran a metal polishing business in Birmingham.He held a valid firearms certificate, allowing him to possess a single semi-automatic weapon. He used this weapon at approved gun clubs for sports shooting at targets. His erratic behaviour, including shooting at dummies dressed in wigs, and modifying his bullets to make them more powerful, led to his being expelled from one club, in Telford, Shropshire. His nickname there had been \"The Cowboy\". Members of another gun club where Williams was a member had expressed concerns that he was stealing bullets.During the mid 1970s, he had been involved in a number of disputes with his neighbours, the Burkitt family, of 16 Andrew Road, alleging that the noise of their television and record player disturbed him and his parents. This became an obsession, and he suffered the delusion that his neighbours were mocking him. On one occasion, during a row about noise, he told Philip Burkitt, \"I'm going to exterminate you\"."

At around 7pm, annoyed by the noise they were making, Williams shot them both with a 9mm Smith & Wesson semi-automatic pistol. George died where he fell and Philip, wounded, ran into the house. Williams followed him, shooting him again and killing him. He then shot and killed George's wife, Iris. The Burkitts' 17-year-old daughter was hit four times in the back and once in the thigh, but survived. Two other neighbours, a married couple who had witnessed the attack on the Burkitts, also survived being shot. The injured were treated at Birmingham General Hospital.After discharging a total of 23 rounds, Williams fled the scene by car, firing a further six shots from a second, .22-calibre pistol as he did so. In Stanhurst Way he shot at two boys, aged 10 and 11, who were playing football, and at a woman, but missed them all. Passing through Wednesbury, he shot through the windows of a barber's shop and two houses. In one of these, a nine-year-old girl was hurt by flying glass. He stopped for petrol in Walsall and drove off without paying.\nAt around 8:10pm, Williams shot and killed another married couple, Michel and Lisa Di Maria, after stopping to use the petrol filling station which they ran, Arbury Road Service Station, in Stockingford, Nuneaton, Warwickshire, some 20 miles (32 km) from his home. Lisa was killed immediately, and Michel died later in hospital.Williams slept rough in some woodland, and was arrested the next morning, in Spring Gardens, Buxton, after a 30 miles (48 km) car chase at high speed, starting on the Derbyshire moors. After his car was involved in a collision, he pulled a gun and attempted to hijack one of the police cars which had been following him. He was overpowered without firing his gun by the unarmed officers who had been pursuing him. He later said he had wanted the police to shoot him. Police found 147 9mm and 770 .22 rounds in his car, along with the .22 calibre pistol which had a full magazine, and several home-made bombs.He was subsequently charged with five counts of murder. Two counts of attempted murder were ordered to lie on file.In March 1979 at Stafford Crown Court he pleaded not guilty to murder but instead pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The plea was accepted by the prosecution, after psychiatrists gave evidence that he had an active paranoid psychosis. His indefinite detention was ordered by the trial judge, Mr Justice Stephen Brown, and he was held in Broadmoor Hospital and at Ashworth Hospital, both high security units.His parents described him as \"a quiet boy\" and said they had \"no idea\" of what he had been preparing to do."

The bomb squad was called in to make the explosive device safe. This was featured in the Channel 5 documentary series The Nightmare Neighbour Next Door.At Birmingham Crown Court in October 2014, he pleaded guilty to three charges of possessing a prohibited firearm, to putting a neighbour in fear of violence, and to making an improvised explosive device. He was again ordered to be detained indefinitely, this time under sections 37 and 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983, by Mr Justice Blair, who said that \"The effect of these orders is that the defendant may never be released\". He also likened Williams's more recent behaviour to that leading up to the 1978 incident and said that \"a similar tragedy had been narrowly averted\". Williams was returned to Ashworth Hospital, where he was already being treated on recall from his previous detention.West Midlands Police announced after the trial concluded that a Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements serious case review would be held. A spokesman for the police said, \"There was no trace of Harry Street on any police systems; but it is thanks to the tenacity of a local police officer who, when the harassment escalated, made extensive checks which led her to Street's GP and his true identity.\"He died on 24 December 2014 from a suspected heart attack.\n\n\n== References =="

He then ran for governor in 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania. He won the election, and was reelected in 1998 with the most votes for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumbered Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century. As Governor of Pennsylvania, he is credited for statewide advances in economic development, education, health care and the environment. As of 2024, he is the last Republican to win reelection as Pennsylvania's governor.\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W.

In January 2003, the Office of Homeland Security became an official Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and Ridge became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. He served in these roles for Bush's first term as president, then retired and returned to the private sector.\nSince reentering the private sector, Ridge has served on the boards of The Home Depot, The Hershey Company and Exelon Corporation and as a senior advisor to Deloitte & Touche and TechRadium. He is also the founder and chairman of Ridge Global, a Washington, D.C.-based security consulting firm.

        "content": "Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush created the Office of Homeland Security within the White House, and named Ridge to head it. The charge to the nation's new director of homeland security was to develop and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to strengthen the United States against terrorist threats or attacks. Ridge formally resigned as Pennsylvania's governor on October 5, 2001.In January 2003 and after the passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Office of Homeland Security split into a Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House Homeland Security Advisory Council. Ridge left the White House and became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. The department's mission \"is to (A) prevent terrorist attacks within the United States; (B) reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism; and (C) minimize the damage, and assist in the recovery, from terrorist attacks that do occur within the United States\" (From H.R. 5005-8 the Homeland Security Act of 2002). The newly created department was the most comprehensive reorganization of the Federal government since the National Security Act of 1947.\nThe Department of Homeland Security consolidates 22 agencies and 180,000 employees, unifying once-fragmented Federal functions in a single agency dedicated to protecting America from terrorism. Ridge worked with the employees from combined agencies to strengthen borders, provide for intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection, improve the use of science and technology to counter weapons of mass destruction, and to create a comprehensive response and recovery division.In January 2004, Ridge was named among others in a lawsuit filed by a Syrian-born Canadian Maher Arar who said he was tortured in Syria after being deported by American authorities."

He explains the challenges and decision-making processes of the newly formed department, and gives his own views as to the future of the security of the United States of America. The book further discusses\n\nthe infighting he saw that frustrated his attempts to build a smooth-running department. Among the headlines promoted by publisher Thomas Dunne Books: Ridge was never invited to sit in on National Security Council meetings; was 'blindsided' by the FBI in morning Oval Office meetings because the agency withheld critical information from him; found his urgings to block Michael Brown from being named head of the emergency agency blamed for the Hurricane Katrina disaster ignored; and was pushed to raise the security alert on the eve of President Bush's re-election, something he saw as politically motivated and worth resigning over.\nRidge wrote in his memoir that then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and then-Attorney General John Ashcroft pressured him to raise the terror alert level, running up to the 2004 elections, because of a pre-election message critical of President Bush from Osama Bin Laden."

Before Marpa would teach Milarepa, he had him undergo abuse and trials, such as letting him build and then demolish three towers in turn. Milarepa was asked to build one final multi-story tower by Marpa at Lhodrag, which still stands. Eventually, Marpa accepted him, explaining that the trials were a means to purify Milarepa's negative karma. Marpa transmitted Tantric initiations and instructions to Milarepa, including tummo (\"yogic heat\"), the \"aural transmissions\" (Wylie: snyan rgyud), and mahamudra. Marpa told Milarepa to practice solitary meditation in caves and mountain retreats, which, according to the biography, after many years of practice resulted in \"a deep experiential realization about the true nature of reality.\" In some other sources, it is said that Milarepa and Marpa both came to India to seek one most important thing for ultimate realisation from Marpa's guru, but even he didn't know about it. Later on he tried for many years and finally attained enlightenment. Thereafter he lived as a fully realized yogi, and eventually even forgave his aunt, who caused his family's misfortune.According to Lopez, The Life of Milarepa represents \"Buddhism as it was understood and practiced in Tibet in the fifteenth century, projected back in time,\" and contains \"many of the key terms and doctrines of Buddhism.\" Tsangny\u00f6n Heruka did his best to establish a lineage of teachers which connects the Kagyu tradition with the Indian siddha tradition, portraying Marpa as a student of Naropa, though Naropa had already died when Marpa went to India."

It describes how Milarepa practiced the generation stage and completion stage, to achieve mahamudra, \"spontaneous realization of the most profound nature of mind.\" Yet, in his instructions to his Tibetan audiences, Milarepa refers to the basic Buddhist teachings of \"impermanence, the sufferings of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the certainty of death and the uncertainty of its arrival, the frightful rebirth that is the direct result of our benighted deeds.\" But, his own life also is an example that even a murderer can transform into a Buddha.

He was baptised on 15 September 1594. He was awarded BA from Magdalen Hall, Oxford on 6 July 1614. He entered Middle Temple on 1 July 1615 and was called to the bar on 23 May 1623.  He was Lord of the Manor of Baunton and a J.P. and Deputy Lieutenant for Gloucestershire.In 1626 George was elected Member of Parliament for Cirencester, and was re-elected in 1628 until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In April 1640, he was re-elected MP for Cirencester in the Short Parliament and in November 1640 he was re-elected for the Long Parliament.  In August 1642, he formed a garrison for Parliament at Cirencester, but was captured by Prince Rupert in the spring of 1643 and taken to Oxford. The Earl of Forth threatened to execute George if Colonel Fiennes, the parliamentary governor of Bristol, executed his prisoners. Although Fiennes did put his prisoners to death, the Earl of Forth relented and spared George. George thereupon changed his views and supported the king. He was accordingly disabled from sitting in parliament and retired to his estates. He became a bencher of his inn in November 1653 and Treasurer in November 1658.After the Restoration, George was re-elected MP for Cirencester in 1661 for the Cavalier Parliament and sat until his death.George probably died in December 1678 aged 85 and was buried at Baunton on 6 January 1679.George married Elizabeth Tirrell, daughter of John Tirrell of St Ives, Huntingdonshire and had five sons and a daughter.\n\n\n== References =="

He was the party's candidate in Yukon in the 1974 federal election, but was not elected.Penikett became a member of the New Democratic Party's federal council in 1973 and served as executive assistant to Ed Broadbent from 1975 to 1977.

He was the party's only MLA elected that year.\nIn 1981, Penikett succeeded Fred Berger as leader of the party. Under his leadership, independent MLA Maurice Byblow crossed the floor to join the party, and Roger Kimmerly won a by-election for the party in October. With the party having surpassed the Yukon Liberal Party in seats, Penikett became Leader of the Opposition.The party won six seats in the 1982 election, retaining Official Opposition status.In the 1985 territorial election, the party won eight seats, forming a minority government with Penikett serving as government leader. Four of the party's eight MLAs were of First Nations descent, with a by-election win by Danny Joe in 1987 bringing First Nations representation in the government to five out of nine; this remains the all-time historical record for First Nations representation in a Canadian legislature. Joe's by-election win also lifted the party to majority government status.Penikett fought the federal government for a better deal for the territory in Canadian confederation and for control over its natural resources. He and Dennis Patterson, premier of the Northwest Territories, also fought for a greater role at First Minister's conferences. Penikett's government negotiated and signed an umbrella agreement for First Nations land claims, negotiated the first four agreements with individual First Nations, and developed an economic development strategy for the Yukon in consultation with citizens.\nPenikett also brought forward the Yukon Human Rights Act, which banned discrimination on the basis of age, race, gender or sexual orientation. It was only the second such act passed anywhere in Canada.The NDP formed a majority government after the 1989 election, winning nine seats. Later that year, Penikett took on the title of Premier, the first government leader in the territory to be given that title, in a bid to increase the territory's clout in relations with the federal and provincial governments.Penikett's government opposed the Meech Lake Accord, believing it would make it impossible for the Yukon to ever become a province. According to Penikett, the accord violated the rights of Yukon residents by granting to each existing province an absolute veto over the creation of a new province, as well as by giving provinces, but not territories, consultation rights on the appointment of new Senators and new Supreme Court justices, and would condemn northerners to \"forever be second-class citizens\". Penikett's government fought the accord in court, although its case was dismissed by the Yukon Court of Appeal. During the subsequent Charlottetown Accord negotiations, Penikett raised many of the same concerns that he had during Meech, although he ultimately supported the final deal.After seven years in power, the NDP was defeated in the 1992 election by the conservative Yukon Party. Penikett's successor, John Ostashek, dropped Penikett's use of the title \"Premier\", reverting to the older form \"Government Leader\", although the \"Premier\" title was reinstituted in 1996 by Piers McDonald and has remained in use ever since.On April 25, 1994 Penikett announced his resignation as leader of the Yukon NDP, and was succeeded by Piers McDonald at a party convention in May 1995. There was an attempt later in 1994 to draft Penikett as a candidate in the federal New Democratic Party's 1995 leadership contest, but he declined to run.He remained in the legislature as the MLA for Whitehorse West until September 27, 1995, when he resigned to accept a position as a policy advisor in the office of Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow."

Dr. Murnane is a founder of the field of ultrafast X-ray science, having made transformational contributions to this area of research in every decade since the 1980s. She is also currently one of the most-accomplished woman laboratory experimental physicists in the U.S., further distinguished by having independently developed her university-based laboratory effort with Prof. Kapteyn.In their lab, Murnane, Kapteyn, and their students make lasers whose beams flash like a strobe light \u2013 except that each flash is a trillion times faster. These lasers, like camera flashes, make it possible to record the motions of atoms in chemical reactions, and of atoms and electrons in materials systems. Some of her lasers can generate pulses of less than 10 femtoseconds. The very high peak power of these ultrashort laser pulses makes it possible to coherently upconvert light to much shorter wavelengths, in the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray region of the spectrum. This high harmonic generation process makes possible for the first time a tabletop-scale X-ray laser light source. \nProf. Murnane was the first to explore the use of femtosecond lasers for x-ray generation, and has made substantive pioneering contributions to many aspects of this area of research, including the science and fundamental understanding of the high harmonic process, the laser technology required to use this process to implement practical tabletop light sources for applications, and in applying this new source to make fundamental discoveries in areas ranging from basic atomic and chemical dynamics, to materials dynamics, to nanoimaging. She is also a founder the area now known as experimental \"Attosecond Science,\" having performed foundational experiments that for the first time clearly demonstrated the ability to manipulate electron dynamics with attosecond precision.She is also the co-founder of the laser company KMLabs, Inc., for which Intel Capital is a co-investor, and which has commercialized these technologies for research and possible industrial applications in nanometrology."

Her father raised her on mostly vegan fresh whole and raw foods. They had their own organic farm growing up, and grew their own produce for food and juicing.Her first job after college was working retail management at Macy's in Herald Square in New York City. Soon afterwards, she moved to London, England for a year and a half, then to Sydney, Australia for 7 months. Upon her return to upstate New York, she studied post-graduate social psychology, computer art, and fine art, which launched her career in multimedia. She produced live multimedia events and convergence TV and internet experiences through the 1990s, and co-founded a multimedia production studio and event company. During this time, she discovered that eating raw foods fueled her mental clarity and focus, and kept her healthy. This was the early beginning of her raw food career.\nPhyo attended Ewha and Yonsei Universities and studied international business, graduating in 1987 and 1989, respectively.  She then graduated from Cornell University with a dual bachelor's in human ecology design and business management, and a minor in nutritional sciences in 1990.  She then did some post-graduate work in social psychology, 3-D modeling and simulation, computer art, fine art and sculpting at SUNY Buffalo, finishing in 1994."

Though her background is in complex, gourmet recipes, today, she teaches simple, fast, easy to make recipes using common ingredients.\nSmartMonkey Foods was co-founded by Phyo in 1999 in Los Angeles, CA. SMF started as a catering and events company, hosting gourmet raw food dinners in Hollywood, Santa Monica, and Pasadena, CA. As customer requests increased for packed and prepared foods, the SmartMonkey Foods line of packed dressings, sauces, cheeses, pizza crust, desserts was launched.\nThe company moved to Portland, Oregon for 4 years from 2003 to 2006, where it provided catering, packaged prepared foods, classes, retreats, weekly cafes, monthly special events, and their fruit and nut bars called SmartMonkey Bars. Clients included Nike, Adidas, Portland Institute of Contemporary Art, and Carnival Cruise Lines, to name a few.\nPhyo sold SmartMonkey Foods, which ceased operations in 2009.Phyo moved to San Francisco and founded a multimedia company called SmartMonkey Media, which produced live multimedia events, including the world's first online fashion show, \"Fiber,\" in 1994 Netcast over copper lines before ISDN or T1 lines were available to the U.C. Berkeley multicast backbone (known as MBone), this show was attended by a global audience via the internet.\nAs an early pioneer of the web, Phyo was a part of San Francisco digital lab, Cyberlab 7, and founder of Dimension 7, where she handled CG work on Virtuosity, the early cyber film starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe and produced by Paramount Pictures.

        "content": "Gasiorowski was born in Paris on March 30, 1930. He studied at the School of Applied Arts between 1947 and 1951, and he married Marie-Claude Charels in 1963. His work, which was strongly linked with the emergence of Pop Art, matured between 1964 and 1972. He based many of his paintings on images collected through Delpire, the publishing house where he worked as a librarian. His photorealistic reproductions of enlarged black-and-white photographs have affinities both with the images in family albums and with publicity photos. Despite the success of these works, Gasiorowski turned away from painting (but not drawing) after 1972. His work changed radically as he became more critical of the tradition of western painting and the structure of the art world, and he turned to photomontage to express his ideas in works such as The Horrors of War. To stage these photos, he created miniature battlefield sets using purchased and homemade toy planes, trains, tanks, and so on. He even costumed himself with a bloody head bandage to serve as one of the wounded. Gasiorowski himself later saw his obsession with this work as one reason that his wife left him in 1976.Another tack Gasiorowski took in his critical investigations was to begin creating fictive artworks such as Worosiskiga Academy, a fake art school run by a tyrant (the name is an anagram of his own last name) which produced a variety of artworks, from drawings and gouaches to objects. One such issue was a set of hats signed with the names of 500 famous artists, intended as a critique of the art market and of the compromises it forced on artists. The first exhibition of the Worosiskiga Academy project was at the Galerie Maeght in 1981; despite the dismal failure of this show, the gallery continue to support and exhibit works by Gasiorowski. The Museum of Modern Art, Paris held a retrospective of his work in 1983.\nGasiorowski's fictions succeeded in confusing visitors to his exhibitions. It was difficult for audiences of the time to know what to make of\u2014for example\u2014an imaginary artist named Kiga, a member of the 'Worosis' tribe, who was the embodiment of 'primitive' painting and who mixed her paints from excrement and aromatic plants to make paintings in the style of C\u00e9zanne. Gasiorowski's fictive productions took a wide range of forms: paintings, drawings, painted objects, organic sculptures.\nAfter 1983, Gasiorowski finally returned to painting and developed several bodies of work, often at monumental scale, in which the groups of paintings were understood to form a single larger work. His final work was a 12-panel polyptych, Fertility.\nHe died suddenly of a heart attack on August 19, 1986, in Lyon, and is buried there in Saint-Julien-du-Sault cemetery.\nHis work is included in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada."

He held this post from 1937 to 1940, developing a statewide reputation for honesty and integrity. Though never having run for public office, he was drafted by New Deal Democrats to run against popular Republican Governor Raymond E. Baldwin. At a tumultuous Democratic convention at the Taft Hotel in New Haven, Hurley defeated the Old Guard, who had convinced former Governor Cross to enter the race, and won the nomination for governor."

        "content": "Hurley, was elected the Governor of Connecticut in 1940. He was Connecticut's first Catholic governor after 300 years of Protestant political dominance. An enthusiastic supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, he successfully set out to reform the state's labor and employment laws and extend electrification to rural areas of the state.  However, other elements of his ambitious reform agenda were stymied by a Republican-controlled General Assembly. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he quickly mobilized the war production effort and forged a labor-management agreement called \"Connecticut's Compact for Victory\" that achieved a \"no strike pledge\" from labor for the unknown duration of the war, and gave the governor sole authority to arbitrate labor disputes during the conflict. The compact became a national model. A fierce opponent of discrimination, he developed a national reputation by integrating housing in the Connecticut  National Guard. Hurley also named the first Jewish judges to the Connecticut bench. He ran unsuccessfully for re-election. He left office on January 6, 1943. He again ran unsuccessfully for governor again in 1944.\nAfter completing his term, Hurley was active in the Democratic National Committee and was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to be a member of the Surplus Property Board from 1944 to 1945. He then retired from public life."

        "content": "Cruikshank was the son of Andrew Crookshanks (c. 1725 \u2013 c. 1783), a former customs inspector, dispossessed for his role in the Jacobite rising of 1745 originally from Edinburgh, and Elizabeth Davidson (born c. 1725), the daughter of a gardener. He was born on 5 October 1764 in Edinburgh, where he was baptised on 14 October 1764. Isaac grew up in New North Kirk parish in Edinburgh after his family moved there. He was the youngest child, and was interested in all sorts of hobbies including sports and music. Isaac studied with a local artist, possibly John Kay (1742\u20131826).\nIn 1783, Cruikshank left Scotland to travel to London with his master. There he married Mary MacNaughton (1769\u20131853) on 14 August 1788. The couple had five known children, two of whom died in infancy. A daughter, Margaret Eliza (1808\u20131825), a promising artist, died at the age of eighteen of tuberculosis. Their sons Isaac Robert Cruikshank (1789\u20131856), and George Cruikshank (1792\u20131878), also became artists.\nCruikshank's first known publications were etchings of Edinburgh \"types\", from 1784. His first caricature etching called Scotch Eloquence was of Edinburgh characters. He produced illustrations for books about the theatre, did the frontispiece for Witticisms and Jests of Dr. Johnson (1791), and illustrated George Shaw's extensive General Zoology (1800\u201326). His water colours were exhibited, but in order to make a living, he found it more lucrative to produce prints and caricatures. He was responsive to the marketplace but firm in his dislikes of Napoleon and Britain's home-grown political radicals, including, for example, the members of the London Corresponding Society and the Society of the Friends of the People. He and James Gillray developed the figure of John Bull, the nationalistic representation of a solid British yeoman. His Olympic games or John Bull introducing his new ambassador to the grand consul and Boney at Brussells (both from 1803) contrast an implied European capitulation and British defiance under the threat of invasion.Near the start of his fame in 1789, Cruikshank produced several watercolours adapted from his earlier drawings, and was on exhibition at the Royal Academy. Publisher John Roach was a friend and patron. Cruikshank later also worked with print dealer S. W. Fores and Johnny Fairburn. He also collaborated with G. M. Woodward, and later, with his son George. (See also G.S. Tregear.) He also etched and designed lottery tickets and the song-heads of musical scores.Cruikshank died of alcohol poisoning at the age of forty-six as a result of a drinking contest, of which he was declared the winner. He is buried near his home in London."

        "content": "During the late 18th century, there was propaganda due to political turbulence in Europe, in particular the French Revolution. The British monarchy was being criticized for debauchery during this time, as it was a period of economic hardship and debt. Political caricature and graphic satire became a prominent outlet for mass propaganda to express competing perspectives on political and economic issues. The revolution triggered feelings and expressions of patriotism towards artists' home countries which they depicted by shedding a grotesque light on their countries' enemies.Isaac Cruikshank, James Gillray, and Thomas Rowlandson were considered the leading caricaturists during this period, and they produced many popular sketches and graphics satirizing contemporary issues. These three prominent artists' distinct styles and subject matter became notable and widespread throughout Europe, although they also adapted and borrowed images from lesser-known artists. The three illustrators were sometimes considered rivals as their ideas often took opposing positions on important matters, despite sometimes collaborating on works. A common theme in all three artists' works was the portrayal of gluttony and cannibalism meant to represent the exploitation of the people by the monarchy, sparked by the effects on the economy of France of the Revolution. Their work, however, had to be published exclusively in Britain, as in France censorship laws were at an all-time high.In 1803 after France declared war on Britain, numerous patriotic prints resulted focused around support and strength for the British homefront. Cruikshank was one of the first to illustrate Napoleon as a negative caricature in his work Buonaparte at Rome Giving Audience in State (1797). In 1809, Cruikshank created French Generals Receiving an English Charge which largely attacked Prince Frederick, Duke of York for his scandalous affairs with Mary Anne Clarke during the time."

He was an avid and skilled water colourist, and had a \"keen sense of humour\", although his achievements during his shortened life suffered from the greater successes and \"more prolonged career of his gifted son.\"There are believed to be at least 345 prints created by Isaac Cruikshank between 1793 and 1800 that are in the British Museum's collection. E.B. Crumbier created a catalogue of around 1350 images that Cruikshank produced in his lifetime. In the Huntington Library, California, there is also a collection of his watercolour drawings.\nCruikshank, like his son Isaac Robert Cruikshank and more famous son George Cruikshank, was a pioneer in the history of comics through creating several cartoons which make use of narrative sequences and/or speech balloons."

In the late 1920s he emigrated to the United States.  In 1935 he founded the Saxl Instrument Company, which designed and manufactured tension meters for use in the textile industry, and later in other industries.  The company, which Saxl ran jointly with his wife, Lucretia Hildreth Saxl, from their home in Harvard, Massachusetts, was renamed Tensitron in 1953.  Saxl is reported as having stated that he worked under Albert Einstein.  He died in 1981.Saxl is most well known for a series of controversial experiments in which he measured unexpected changes in the period of a torsion pendulum under various conditions.  In one series of experiments, the period of a torsion pendulum situated inside a Faraday cage, with the pendulum and the cage connected by a conducting path, was observed to increase as the voltage on the cage was increased.  In another experiment, the period of the pendulum was seen to increase during an eclipse.  Saxl is reported to have attempted, without success, to get this work published in the Physical Review; eventually the work was published in Nature.In the early 1960s, Saxl began a collaboration with Mildred Allen of Mount Holyoke College.  In 1971,  Saxl and Allen published a report of  anomalous changes in the period of a torsion pendulum during a solar eclipse in 1970 and hypothesized that \u201cgravitational theory needs to be modified\u201d.  In addition, they observed unexplained diurnal variation in the period of the pendulum.  None of the effects observed by Saxl and Allen have obvious explanations in terms of well-established theories of gravity and electromagnetism.  Although more subtle explanations, still using conventional physical theory, have been proffered there does not appear to be general agreement as to the cause of the anomalies.  Saxl and Allen's claim that general relativity must be modified, and earlier claims of a similar nature by Allais based on observations of anomalies in the behaviour of a paraconical pendulum, have not won acceptance by the physics community, and recent attempts to reproduce the phenomena have not been successful."

Her image famously appears in Novalis\u2019 Hymns to the Night, a foundational text of the literary movement known as German Romanticism.\nAlthough Novalis's love for Sophie has assumed mythic proportions, their time together was short and uneventful. The two met on 17 November 1794 when Novalis was twenty-two and Sophie was only twelve. They became engaged on Sophie's thirteenth birthday 17 March 1795. Sophie became sick in November 1795, and her sickness continued until her death at the age of 15 in March 1797. The loss of Sophie brought about a deep period of mourning and suffering in Novalis' life. Even so, he became engaged to Julie von Charpentier in December 1798.\nThe depth of Sophie's love for Novalis is uncertain given her young age. Some of her diary entries, found in Wm. O\u2019Brien's Novalis: Signs of Revolution, provide some insight into her relationship with Novalis:\n\n1 March.  Today Hartenberch visited again nothing happened.\n11 March. We were alone today and nothing at all happened.\n12 March. Today was like yesterday nothing at all happened.\n13 March. Today was repentance day and Hartenb. was here.\n14 March. Today Hartenber. was still here he got a letter from his brother.Sophie had a sister, Caroline von K\u00fchn, and a stepsister, Wilhelmine von Th\u00fcmmel.\nLudwig Tieck's biography of Novalis describes Sophie, saying: \"Even as a child, she gave an impression which--because it was so gracious and spiritually lovely--we must call superearthly or heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into an actual reality.\" von K\u00fchn and Novalis' relationship is the focus of the 1995 novel The Blue Flower by Penelope Fitzgerald."

Subsequently, a spokesman for Padwa doubted the credibility of the alleged victim, claiming the allegations had already been dismissed by social services as \"malicious\".\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Martinus Hendrikus Hogervorst-Benders (born 23 July 1971, Helmond) is a Dutch poet and philosopher, and chief editor of literary magazine De Honingzaag\nBenders published his first poetry book titled 'Karavanserai' in 2008, with Nieuw Amsterdam publishers. He got nominated for the prestigious Buddingh prize for the book, but staged a Laibach-esque performance on the awards, where Bart van der Pligt read an Anti-Price poem and Samuel Vriezen wearing a fake moustache yelled the prize had to be taken seriously from within the audience. Benders sang 'Lezen is Lezen' ('Reading is reading') from a dark corner, to the tune of the known 'Life is Life' song of the Austrian band Opus.In 2011 Benders sabotaged the National Turing Poetry contest by simultaneously sending in poems that ended in the top 100, sending in a song about Jury Member Gerrit Komrij Kom nou Mr Komrij (based on Frankly Mr Shankly of the Smiths) and making an alternate character named 'Bert' that severely criticized the quality of the top 100. Ramsey Nasr, the National Poet, gave a raving speech against 'Bert' at the nominations Gala day, not knowing it was Benders, and claimed Bert was just jealous for not making it into the Top 100.\nAfter this successful action Benders vowed to stop this particular artform. He left his publisher and self-published a second volume of poetry named 'Wat koop ik voor jouw donkerwilde machten, Willem' ('What do I buy for your darkwilde powers, William') with 91 poems, which got raving reviews on major poetry sites but was ignored by the poetry magazine establishment.\nIn February 2013 Benders, as a situationist artwork, put a Bill Knott poem into the Turing National Poetry contest. Benders was present with 2 poems in the Top 20, but sent the Sesame Street character 'Bert' to collect the nomination. The jury took several ressentimental jibes at Bert, which he recorded and remixed into a video named '36 Euro'.\nMuch of Benders\u2019 work combines not only literary styles, such as lyrical, conceptual, satirical, and absurdist influences; his work also moves across genres, media and modes. Some examples are: his Laibach-inspired performance at a poetry award including an Anti-Prize poem and choreographed chants from within the audience, and a fake moustache; several submissions to poetry contests intended as playful self-referential critique of poetry institutions and contests as such; W\u00f4ld, W\u00f4ld, W\u00f4ld! (2013) a personalized poetry book, including dedications and assignments to the reader, poems in Dutch and English, concrete poems, images. Stubbing Out a Cigarette on a Nightingale will be Benders\u2019 first English language poetry collection. In 2014, Dutch publisher van Gennep has republished some of Benders\u2019 works that had only been available as self-published prints.\nBenders published five books with van Gennep but in 2019 after a discussion with Ruud Poppelaars and Monique van der Kubbe he decided to get involved in the new publishing house De Kaneelfabriek, a name loosely based on a novel by Bruno Schulz. He has since published Baah Baaah Krakschaap/ De P van Winterslaap there, a counterprinted experimental volume of poetry that managed to sell out two prints, unique for such experimental poetry.\nIn 2020/2021 Benders published a Gaelic-based collection of 'magical poetry' Ginneninne that infused the Dutch language with Gaelic and Irish-based neologisms. He subsequently mailed the book to critics with a tab of 1cp-LSD inside, since critic Piet Gerbrandy in his review of Baah Baaah Krakschaap had written that 'sober analysis does not yield too much result'."

(1) The composer Samuel Vriezen stood up during the performance with a fake moustache stuck on screaming 'the Buddingh' Prize must be taken seriously!' \nErik Lindner in De Groene Amsterdammer calls this a courageous debut ('Martijn Benders has something few poets have: guts') and compares Benders to Tonnus Oosterhof, by his own admission the first time such a comparison has struck him.

Immediately after the publication of the collection, Christian professor Tom van Deel launched the attack via the review service Biblion, intended for libraries. According to van Deel, the 'Willem' in the title referred to Willem Thies, and was now typical network poetry by network poets.  \nHowever, Gerrit Komrij in his Poetry Calendar calls Benders 'one of the greatest talents of our time', and he observes that 'The supervisors who hand out the talent cards are too busy in their own playgrounds to read Benders'.  \nIn the Groene Amsterdammer, Piet Gerbrandy called the collection 'outstanding'."

In which they meekly 'evolve' along with the psychotic delusions of a PVV-like boor, all contained in a kind of Disney fable that is patently fake. Poet Alexis de Roode writes on Goodreads: \"Flierman's Passage\" is a scathing book, in a Dadaist sense. An absurdist, at times hilarious, at times also repulsive allegory of a Western society that has lost all its coherence, where all spiritual values have long since been effectively demolished, where all writers are poseurs pretending to each other that there is still something to defend, find or reveal, where fascists and democrats, people who defend values and people who attack values, are interchangeable and randomly dive into bed with each other, where ethical issues only have a meaning as a fetish. At the end, the two-headed scheming duo, Jos and Chamiel, walk into the bike shed as a happy love pair, just as sometime during 2020 Baudet and Rutte will walk into the bike shed together, \"two lost souls who found each other in a morgue\".Flierman's passage is an aptly absurdist parable for today's hollowed-out, de-spiritualised Netherlands, a nihilistic and outrageous fairy tale by one of the worst freethinkers among Dutch poets. Ironically, afterwards the ex-girlfriend of Thierry Baudet discussed the book in de Volkskrant, from a kind of recipe idea for literature: a bit of humour + a bit of seriousness, and the novel is done. According to Bo van Houwelingen, there was too much humour in the book."

That they do this through prizes and other means is clear from Marc van Oostendorp's piece on the site Neerlandistiek: after all, why would professors 'refuse to have anything to do with a poet' (6) According to Benders, this not only shows a lack of secularism but these Christians also abuse the Woke-narrative by doing one-twos: someone of colour is alternated with a Christian poet, and thus you can appear progressive with a heavily conservative agenda."

Through drugs and chemicals, this entity created a docile population that cannot concentrate and thus cannot think or read, and is barely able to formulate a coherent sequence of thoughts in succession. Through a meteoric devolution caused, among other things, by poor nutrition and manipulated receptors, a dystopia took shape that fantasy cannot escape. The book contains a number of hypotheses that are unique: for instance, the philosopher Heraclitus is said to have written not a philosophical work but 'the world's first trip report' on the Fly agaric, and Benders also has a hypothesis that it was a precursor of the fly agaric that caused fish to live on land through the Repetitive Movement Syndrome."

        "content": "Cornelius, as an oil painter, possessed little technical skill, and his works do not exhibit any instinctive appreciation of colour. Even as a fresco painter his manipulative power was not great. In critically examining the execution in colour of some of his magnificent designs, one cannot help feeling that he was, in this respect, unable to do them full justice. Cornelius and his associates endeavoured to follow in their works the spirit of the Italian painters. But the Italian strain is to a considerable extent modified by the D\u00fcrer heritage. This D\u00fcrer influence is manifest in a tendency to overcrowding in composition, in a degree of attenuation in the proportions of, and a\npoverty of contour in, the nude figure, and also in a leaning to the selection of Gothic forms for draperies. These peculiarities are even noticeable in Cornelius's principal work of the \"Last Judgment\", in the Ludwigskirche in Munich.The attenuation and want of flexibility of contour in the nude are perhaps most conspicuous in his frescoes of classical subjects in the Glyptothek, especially in that representing the contention for the body of Patroclus. But despite these peculiarities there is always in his works a grandeur and nobility of conception. Although not dexterous in the handling of the brush, he could conceive and design a subject with masterly purpose. If he had an imperfect eye for colour, he had vast mental foresight in directing the German school of painting; and his favorite motto of \"Deutschland uber alles\" indicates the direction and the strength of his patriotism. His pupils included Karl Hermann, Wilhelm von Kaulbach and Adam Eberle. Cornelius often relied on pupils and assistants for the execution, and sometimes even the design of the projects of which he was in charge. The cartoons for the Glyptothek were all by Cornelius's own hand; in the Pinakothek, however, his sketches and small drawings sufficed, and at the Ludwigskirche even the invention of some of the subjects was entrusted to Hermann."

        "content": "In 1855 Th\u00e9ophile Gautier wrote that Cornelius \"enjoyed a celebrity such as few artists enjoy in their lifetime\", adding that he was admired \"as if he were already dead\". To comprehend and appreciate thoroughly the magnitude of the work which Cornelius accomplished for Germany, we must remember that at the beginning of the 19th century Germany had no national school of art. Germany was in painting and sculpture behind all the rest of Europe. Yet in less than half a century Cornelius founded a great school, revived mural painting, and turned the gaze of the art world towards Munich. The German revival of mural painting had its effect upon England, as well as upon other European nations, and led to the famous cartoon \ncompetitions held in Westminster Hall, and ultimately to the partial decoration of the Houses of Parliament. In November 1841, when the latter work was in contemplation, Cornelius, in response to \ninvitations, visited England. His opinion was in every way favourable to the carrying out of the project, and even in respect of the durability of fresco in the English climate.Cornelius, in his teaching, always inculcated a close and rigorous study of nature, but he understood by the study of nature something more than constantly making studies from life; he meant the study of nature with an inquiring and scientific spirit. Study nature, was the advice he once gave, in order that you may become acquainted with its essential forms."

Having served in Morocco, the Philippines, and Cuba, he went on to be Spain's naval minister, chief of naval staff, naval attach\u00e9 in London, the captain of several warships, and most notably, commander of the Cuba Squadron during the Spanish\u2013American War.

Cervera entered the naval college at the age of thirteen and was later made a midshipman during his first voyage to Havana in 1858. He later made lieutenant junior grade at the age of 21 and spent time serving in both Cuba (during the early part of the Ten Years' War) and also Morocco (during the Spanish\u2013Moroccan war). Later, Cervera was deployed to the Spanish Philippines, where, under the command of Admiral Casto M\u00e9ndez N\u00fa\u00f1ez, in September 1864 he took part in the storming of Fort Pagalungan against the Moro rebels. During that action, he distinguished himself by capturing the enemy flag and was promoted to lieutenant for his service, receiving a mention in the official report on the battle. Afterwards, Cervera took part in expeditions mapping the hundreds of islands of the Philippine archipelago, which became useful to sailors navigating the area. In 1865 he returned to the Spanish homeland and got married.Due to the political instability that persisted in Spain since Napoleon's invasion, Cervera took part in putting down the Cantonal rebellion during one of the Carlist Wars. He later commanded the schooner Circe and the corvette Santa Lucia back in the Philippines, where Cervera again took part in operations against insurgents. In 1876 the Spanish captain was appointed as the Governor of Jolo, although he later contracted malaria because of the conditions there and barely survived, returning to Madrid to report on the conditions in the Philippines shortly after that at the request of Prime Minister Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo. C\u00e1novas asked Cervera to take up the post of Minister of the Navy, but Cervera refused, saying that he preferred to be at sea rather than at a desk job. In 1879, he was given command of the training corvette Ferolana, where he remained until 1882, when he was transferred to oversee the Cartagena naval base. From 1885 to 1890, he served on the shipbuilding commission of the battleship Pelayo and became its first commander, but had to fight against the bureaucratic procedures of the Spanish Navy that caused delays in her construction."

A year later the captain was assigned to oversee the construction of several cruisers for the Spanish Navy at the request of the Queen Regent. Around that time multiple politicians wanted Cervera to become the Minister of the Navy, but he continued to resist because he detested politics. Finally, in 1892, Prime Minister Pr\u00e1xedes Mateo Sagasta asked the Queen Regent to compel him to accept the position of naval minister in his government. She did so, and Cervera reluctantly accepted, being promoted to Contraalmirante (rear admiral). But the newly promoted flag officer made the prime minister promise to not lower the naval budget in return, which Mateo accepted. However, it was not long before the prime minister broke that promise and so Cervera resigned from the position in 1892, but not before trying to make efforts to improve the Spanish Navy's efficiency. The rear admiral was appointed as the naval attach\u00e9 in London shortly afterwards, where he witnessed the technical innovations being made by the British Royal Navy, a post he held until the situation in Cuba began escalating around 1896\u201397."

        "content": "The admiral viewed the escalation of tensions between the kingdom and the United States with alarm, as he believed their defeat would be inevitable in a war because of the U.S. Navy's advancements between 1892 and 1896. Cervera thought that the Spanish were unprepared and did not possess enough ships to defend their colonies. Nonetheless, he accepted the posting of commander of the Cuban squadron on 20 October 1897 and immediately organized training exercises to prepare the crews, since the last time naval drills had been carried out was 1884 (during tensions with the German Empire over the Caroline Islands). Cervera sought to correct the numerous deficiencies in the fleet within a short time period, including lack of training and inadequate supplies. He continued to face difficulties from the naval ministry of Admiral Segismundo Bermejo, however. After the explosion aboard the American battleship USS Maine in Havana harbor in February 1898, the admiral sped back to Spain to speak to the government in person, but received orders from the Admiralty while at Cape Verde to take several ships back to Cuba and prepare for war, despite the severe problems in the fleet. Cervera returned to the Caribbean and slipped past American ships to enter the harbor Santiago de Cuba on May 19, despite several mishaps and having difficulties finding a port to refuel on coal, as most of the European countries with possessions in the Caribbean remained officially neutral. His total force included the cruisers Infanta Maria Teresa, Vizcaya, Almirante Oquendo, and Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n, along with two destroyers.\nThe U.S. remained unaware of the Spanish squadron's whereabouts for another several days, prior to it being discovered on May 28 or 29 at Santiago harbor by the Flying Squadron under Commodore Winfield Scott Schley. On May 31, the two sides exchanged fire, between the Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n and three American vessels (USS Iowa, Massachusetts, and New Orleans). After some time, Cervera ordered his squadron's cruiser to return to the harbor, with neither side having taken any damage. The rest of the North Atlantic Squadron under Rear Admiral William T. Sampson, operating in Cuban waters, did not arrive until June 1, and together the U.S. naval forces blockaded Cervera's squadron in Santiago. On June 2\u20133, the American commander decided to try to blockade the Spanish ships in the harbor by sinking a collier, the USS Merrimac, at the entrance. However, it came under fire from the defenders and was forced aground, at which point the Spanish admiral personally met with its American crewmen, who were taken prisoner. \n\n\"\u00a1Bien, muy bien! \u00a1Sois unos valientes! \u00a1Os felicito!\"\"Good, very good! You are brave! I congratulate you!\"\nCervera later sent his chief of staff under a flag of truce to give a note to Admiral Sampson informing him that the collier's crew was alive and safe. It was an act that impressed his American opponents and Sampson later noted that the affair \"gave us a favorable impression of the Spanish officers.\"The fleet remained mostly inactive in harbor for the next month until July 2, when Ram\u00f3n Blanco, the military governor of Cuba, gave orders for a sortie against the American blockade. Earlier, Admiral Cervera had argued with the authorities in Madrid against taking such an action, but Blanco settled the matter with his order. They formally departed on July 3. The U.S. fleet sounded the alarm at 9:31 in the morning on July 3. The approaching Spanish ships, with Cervera's flagship Infanta Maria Teresa leading the way, opened fire and engaged the U.S. fleet. They headed west while remaining near the coastline.  The American battleships and cruisers pursued them as they made their way along the coast as the Spanish admiral's flagship sustained heavy damage from them. With their engines damaged, Cervera decided to ground the Infanta Maria Teresa, which they did at 10:15 am. Around 10:20, the Almirante Oquendo was forced out of action with heavy damage and grounded. The two destroyers, Plut\u00f3n and Furor, put up a fight before also the former ran aground and the latter was sunk by 10:30 am.As the admiral's flagship raised a white flag on the beach, the remaining two cruisers \u2013 Vizcaya and Col\u00f3n \u2013 were pursued, with the former being destroyed around 11:00 while the latter made it fifty miles from Santiago before being grounded on a beach. After that, the American ships began rescue operations for the Spanish sailors of the destroyed squadron, and among those captured from the wreck of the Infanta Maria Teresa was Admiral Cervera. That afternoon, he made it onto the USS Iowa, where he and the other Spanish officers met with Captain Robley D. Evans and formally surrendered to them. Afterwards, Cervera and the rest of the captured prisoners were sent to Annapolis, where they were free to roam the U.S.  Naval Academy and were greeted with cheers by Americans. The New York Times reported that he appeared to be \"much affected by the genuineness and spontaneity of the feeling manifested.\" On August 20, he was offered freedom by the U.S. government on the condition that he would not take up arms against the United States, but he refused, saying that accepting conditional freedom was illegal by Spanish law, and did not return to Spain until September 1898. He gained popularity among both the Spanish and American public in the years after the war."

His brother was the founder of Nippon Suisan Kaisha and his uncle Fujita Densabur\u014d was the founder of the Fujita zaibatsu. He studied in 1885 at the Tokyo Commercial School (the predecessor of Hitotsubashi University) and went on to graduate from Keio University. After graduation, he joined the Morimura-gumi, but on the recommendation of ex-Ch\u014dsh\u016b politicians Inoue Kaoru, he joined his uncle\u2019s company, the Fujita-gumi (current Dowa Holdings), and in 1891 was assigned management of the Kosaka mine in Kosaka, Akita, one of the largest lead, copper and zinc mines in Japan. He introduced new technologies and made the mine very profitable.\nIn 1903, he left the Fujita-gumi, and acquired the Akazawa Copper Mine in Ibaraki Prefecture in 1905, renaming it the Hitachi Copper Mine. He established Hitachi Seisakusho in 1910, merging his operations into Kuhara K\u014dgy\u014d in 1912. The mine became the second largest producer of copper in Japan in 1914 through mechanization and improved production techniques.\nDuring World War I, Kuhara expanded his operations into a vast array of enterprises, ranging from shipbuilding  to fertilizer production, petrochemical, life insurance, trading and shipping, creating the Kuhara zaibatsu. However, the overextended company experienced severe financial difficulties in the post-war depression, and Kuhara turned to his brother-in-law, Yoshisuke Aikawa, who created a holding company called Nihon Sangy\u014d, or Nissan for short.  Kuhara went on to a career in politics, forging ties with future Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka and other political and military leaders, which Aikawa would later use to his advantage.In 1928, Kuhara was elected to the lower house of the Diet of Japan as a member of the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai from the Yamaguchi 1st Electoral District, and was made Minister of Communications the same year in the Tanaka administrationHe served as secretary-general of the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai in 1931 under Inukai Tsuyoshi. Politically, Kuhara supported a hard-line approach against China, and was a vocal supporter of a constitutional reform intended to transform Japan into a one-party state. However, Kuhara was briefly arrested after the February 26 incident and forced to resign from the party after it was discovered that he had made a financial contribution to the rebels.After the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai party split, Kuhara was invited back into politics by Ichir\u014d Hatoyama, leading the faction opposed to Chikuhei Nakajima, and rising to the post of president of the party in 1939.In 1940, he presided over the absorption of the party into Fumimaro Konoe\u2019s Taisei Yokusankai, thus fulfilling his ambition of creating a one-party state. Under the Hiranuma administration, he served as an advisor to the cabinet. He was one of the key organizers of the League of Diet Members Carry Through the Holy War.\nAfter World War II, Kuhara was purged by the American occupation authorities. After the end of the occupation, he was elected to the post-war House of Representatives of Japan from the Yamaguchi 2nd Electoral District in the 1952 General Election. He played an important role in the restoration of Russo-Japanese relations and Sino-Japanese relations.\nKuhara died at his home in Shirokanedai, Minato, Tokyo in January 1965. His home is now the Happo-en, a hotel with a noted Japanese garden."

        "content": "Payette was born in Verdun, Quebec, the daughter of Fernand Ouimet, a bus driver, and C\u00e9cile Chartier. She was educated in Montreal, Quebec. She started a career in journalism at a radio station in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res in 1954. She held various jobs, including editor of the weekly Frontier Rouyn-Noranda, host of the show La Femme dans le monde (The Woman in the World) at CKRN and secretary and public relations officer for the United Steelworkers of America. While living in Paris she wrote for Petit Journal at the Patrie, for New Journal, and for Ch\u00e2telaine magazine. \nPayette returned to Montreal where she worked on the television program Interdit aux hommes (\"prohibited to men\") for Radio-Canada. From 1965 to 1972, Payette worked on a series of animated television programs for the French and English networks of the CBC. From 1972-75, Payette was the host of the TV series Appelez moi Lise\" (Call Me Lise) and Lise Lib. Payette was appointed President of the Quebec National Holidays Committee in 1975.Payette held several portfolios in the Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque government. She was Minister for Consumer Affairs, Cooperatives and Financial Institutions, the  Minister of State for the Status of Women, and the Minister of State for Social Development. The phrase \"Je me souviens\" (\"I remember\") on Quebec vehicle license plates is attributed to Payette, replacing the old slogan of \"La Belle Province\". Payette was also instrumental in the founding of the SAAQ automobile insurance company of Quebec, and the updating of the Civil Code of Quebec, allowing two surnames for children.\nDuring the campaign for the 1980 Quebec referendum Payette denounced women supporters of the \"No\" side as Yvettes (the name of a docile young girl in an old school textbook). She went so far as calling Claude Ryan's wife, Madeleine Guay, an \"Yvette\". This backfired spectacularly as \"the Yvettes\", led by Guay, held a number of political rallies in response to her remarks.  As Donald Brittain put it in his documentary series of Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque and Pierre Elliott Trudeau, The Champions, \"The old women were proud to be 'Yvettes'. The young women resented being 'Yvettes'.  Payette had galvanized them into a fighting force\". The first of those rallies happened on March 30 when a group of 1,700 women held the brunch des Yvettes at the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac in Quebec City. A major rally occurred at the Montreal Forum on April 7 when 14,000 women denounced the minister's declarations about women and manifested their support for the \"No\" side. This was the first major rally for the \"No\" side in the campaign. This would be followed by many more rallies, particularly by women groups. Lise Payette would eventually apologize for her remarks.\nIn 1981, Payette left political life and did not stand for re-election. She became a writer for television with a series of successful soap operas. She founded the television production company Focus, with whom she first conceived the documentary series \"Les quatre chevaliers de l'apocalypse\" and \"Femmes\" and other fiction series, as a producer or author.\nIn 2004, Payette began writing columns for the Journal de Montreal. In 2007, she switched to Le Devoir. Payette continued to write for the paper until May 6, 2016, when she signed off with the phrase \"Le Devoir ends the chronicle of Lise Payette,\" without further explanation, although she has since claimed that editor Brian Myles let her go without explanation from one day to the next.In 2007, Payette wrote a song for Celine Dion entitled \"Je cherche l'ombre\" which is included on Dion's D'Elles album.\nIn 1994, Payette was recognized as \"Woman of the Year\" by Canadian Women in Communications. Payette was awarded the Florence Bird Award by the International Centre for Human Rights and Development in 1997. She was awarded the Grand Prize of the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television, September 27, 1998. \nIn 2000, Payette was awarded the gold medal of the Mouvement national des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, September 30, 2000. In 2001, she was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec. In 2003, she received a lifetime achievement award from the Quebec Business Women's Network. In June 2009, she received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Quebec in Montreal. Payette was awarded the Pierre-Vadebonc\u0153ur Prize in 2012 and the Guy-Price Mauffette Prize in 2014. Payette died at her home on September 5, 2018.Payette defended former PQ premier Pauline Marois's failed legislation known as the Charter of Quebec Values, which would prohibit public servants from wearing religious garb at work.  The proposal, seen to target Muslim women, was widely criticized even by some Quebec nationalists.Her daughter, Dominique Payette, ran unsuccessfully for the PQ in the riding of Charlesbourg in the 2014 election.\nPayette in 2016 defended her friend, the deceased film director Claude Jutra, about allegations that he sexually abused children that were revealed after his death.In 2017, Payette tried to dissuade Quebec media personality L\u00e9a Clermont-Dion from proceeding with a complaint of sexual assault alleged against journalist Michel Venne."

        "content": "Dele Giwa was killed by a parcel bomb in his home at Ikeja, Lagos, while in his study with Kayode Soyinka, on Sunday 19 October 1986. The assassination occurred two days after he had been interviewed by State Security Service (SSS) officials. In an off-the-record interview with airport journalists, Lt. Col. A.K. Togun, the Deputy Director of the SSS had claimed that on 9 October Dele Giwa and Alex Ibru had organised a media parley for media executives and the newly created SSS. Togun claimed that it was at this meeting that the SSS and the media executives reached a secret censorship agreement. Under this agreement, the media was to report any story with potential to embarrass the government to the SSS before they tried to publish same.Giwa had been invited by the SSS to their headquarters for the first time on 19 September 1986, after writing an article in which he described the newly introduced Second-Tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM) as \"God's experiment\" and suggested that if SFEM failed, the people would stone their leaders in the streets. Giwa was interviewed and his statement taken by two SSS operatives. He was later taken to meet with Lt Col Togun, the deputy director of the agency in his office. Togun is reported to have told Giwa that he found nothing offensive in the story as Giwa had also stated in the same story that he was hopeful that Babangida seemed determined to make SFEM work.According to Giwa's neighbour and colleague, Ray Ekpu, on 16 October 1986, Giwa had been questioned over the telephone by Col Halilu Akilu of the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) over an allegation that Dele had been heard speaking to some people about arms importation. SSS officials reportedly summoned Giwa to their headquarters again on 16 October 1986, and on the next day Ekpu accompanied him to the SSS headquarters for the interview. Lt. Col Togun accused Giwa and Newswatch of planning to write the \"other side\" of the story on Ebitu Ukiwe who was removed as Chief of the General staff, to General Babangida. The magazine had published a cover story titled, \"Power Games: Ukiwe loses out\", in its edition of 20 October which was on sale on 13 October 1986. Togun also accused Giwa plotting with the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, and students to carry out a socialist revolution. Giwa was also accused of saying that Newswatch would employ the suspended police public relations officer Alozie Ogugbuaja. Ogugbuaja claims that on 16 October 1986, a bomb was defused by the police bomb squad at his official residence in GRA, Ikeja, Lagos. Ogugbuaja also said that he suspected that his phone might have been bugged because Giwa and Ray Ekpu in one of their telephone conversations with him had indeed promised to employ him in Newswatch if the police dismissed him. Ray Ekpu also believed that their houses and phones may have been bugged because he did discuss employing Ogugbuaja in Newswatch with dele Giwa over the phone only; he said that he found two bugging devices in the cover of two books inside his study. Lt. Col. Togun while questioning Giwa had claimed that he wasn't aware of the fact that Akilu had already questioned Giwa over the gun running allegations the day before, this was after Giwa had brought it to his attention.Giwa reported the interrogations to his friend Prince Tony Momoh who was then the Minister of Communications, Giwa had told Momoh that he feared for his life because of the weight of the accusations levelled against him. According to Ekpu, Momoh \"dismissed it as a joke and said the security men just wanted to rattle him\"; Momoh promised to look into the matter. On Saturday 18 October, Giwa also spoke to Admiral Augustus Aikhomu, the Chief of General Staff who said he was familiar with the matter and also promised to look into it.\nLater on 18 October, a day before the bombing, a staff of the DMI had phoned Giwa's house and asked for his office phone number from his wife Funmi. This same person from the DMI later called back to say he couldn't reach Giwa at the office and then put Col Akilu on the line. Ekpu alleges that Akilu asked Giwa's wife for driving directions to the house and when she asked him why he needed the directions he explained that he wanted to stop by the house on his way to Kano and he wasn't very familiar with Ikeja, he also offered that the President's ADC had something for Giwa, probably an invitation. According to Ekpu, this didn't come as a surprise because Giwa had received advance copies of some of the President's speeches in the past through Akilu.On the morning of 19 October, Giwa phoned Akilu to ask why he had been calling his house the previous day. Akilu had earlier called one of Dele Giwa's wife to request for his home address. Akilu was alleged to have explained that he only wanted to tell Giwa that the matter had been resolved. Ekpu says Giwa replied Akilu that it wasn't over and that he had already informed his lawyer, Chief Gani Fawehinmi to follow up on the matter. Akilu then told Giwa that there was no need for that, that it wasn't a matter for lawyers and that he should consider the matter resolved.\nAbout 40 minutes after the telephone conversation with Akilu, a package was delivered to Giwa's guard while the guard handed it over to Giwa's son, Billy. (the accounts of which vehicle was used to deliver the package vary). According to Billy, the parcel had the seal of Nigerian Coat of Arms, restricting the letter to the name written on it . Billy also said that was not the first time his father will be receiving letters from the government  When Giwa received the package from his son, he was with Kayode Soyinka (London Bureau Chief of Newswatch). The package exploded on Dele Giwa's laps, mortally wounded him and temporarily deafening Soyinka, who had excused himself to the rest room shortly before Giwa was supposed to have attempted opening the package. Giwa was rushed to the hospital where he eventually died from his wounds."

        "content": "On 20 October, the day after the bombing, the government convened a press conference presided over by Augustus Aikhomu. Before the press conference started, all press photographers, foreign journalists, and Nigerians that worked for foreign news media were ordered out. Those left behind were told that the briefing was \"off the record\" and Aikhomu would not be entertaining any questions.Aikhomu then went on to ask Ismaila Gwarzo, the Director of the SSS and Haliru Akilu to render their accounts of what had transpired between Dele Giwa and their agencies in the recent past. Gwarzo confirmed that the SSS had invited Giwa for questioning over allegations of gun running. Akilu on his part confirmed that he had called Giwa's home on 18 October to ask for directions to the house so he could stop over to see Giwa while on his way to Kano through Ikeja airport. Akilu also said that he had wanted to visit Giwa at home to \"prove a Hausa adage that if you visit someone in his house, you show him you are really a friend.\" Ekpu claimed that he remembered Gwarzo saying that the killing was \"quite embarrassing\" and also that Tony Momoh had described it as \"a clear case of assassination\"; later he was quoted saying, \"a special probe would serve no useful purpose\".\nGraffiti of the time implied a belief that the SSS had been responsible.In a newspaper interview years later in retirement, Chris Omeben who at the time was the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in charge of the Federal Investigation and Intelligence Bureau (FIIB) at Alagbon, on his part recalled that he was the second officer to have handled the case file after he had taken it over from his predecessor at the FIIB, Victor Pam. Omeben explained that he had done what any competent investigator would have done in unraveling the circumstances surrounding the death of Dele Giwa. He went on to say that he had examined the crime scene and found it suspicious that the toilet adjacent to the blast site which Kayode Soyinka alleged he was occupying when the explosion occurred had also suffered damage from the blast but Soyinka was left unscathed. Omeben described the force of the explosion to have been strong enough to blow out the steel bars over the toilet window (burglary protection), which in his own assessment made Soyinka's story less convincing. Omeben also claims he requested to interview Dan Agbese, Ray Ekpu and Kayode Soyinka. Of the three, only Agbese turned up, he was later to find out that Soyinka had fled the country. Omeben also recalled that in the course of his investigations he had cause to interrogate both Haliru Akilu and Tunde Togun. According to Omeben Akilu defended Giwa's invitation to the DMI by saying Giwa was invited to clarify statements he made  to a New York daily which had been assessed as having potential to paint the country in a bad light in the international press. The only known interview Giwa gave to any New York daily was one published eight months earlier in a New York Times story about rising religious nationalism and extremism in Nigeria. On the issue of rising Islamic nationalism, Giwa gave this singular quote in the story, It's a dangerous, explosive trend,...in the worst case, I see a situation where die-hard Christians and die-hard Moslems are fighting in the streets. Omeben said he was satisfied with the reasons Akilu and Togun gave for inviting Giwa.However, Soyinka has come out to reply Omeben and accused him of spreading deliberate falsehood with his comments on him on his involvement with the parcel bomb incident. In an interview he granted The Nation newspaper of Lagos of Saturday, 19 January 2013, Soyinka denied that he ran to the toilet when the bomb exploded. He said he did not know where Omeben got that false information from. When questioned, Soyinka requested to not be required to relive the experience again.Omeben also alleged that he was being pressured into naming Babangida and Akilu as suspects when he yet had no evidence linking them to the crime. Some of this pressure led to the formation of a special squad to investigate the case, the squad was headed by Assistant Commissioner of Police Abubakar Tsav. Omeben alleges that the then Inspector General of Police Gambo Jimeta has asked him to leave the case with the Tsav team out of anger at how messy the whole situation was getting.Omeben also spoke about certain \"fixations\" in the minds of the general public about the case, in his own words \"...There is the tendency for people to make up their minds as to what they want to see or hear. It may not necessarily be the truth and once they are so fixated, every other thing that somebody else would say would not mean anything to them. Dele Giwa's case suffered such a fixation\".In testimony that he gave on 3 July 2001, before the Justice Oputa led Human Rights Violations Investigations Commission (HRVIC), Tsav alleged that the government stonewalled his investigation into the assassination. Tsav claimed that he was not granted permission to question key actors involved, including Tunde Togun, Ismaila Gwarzo and Haliru Akilu. He also said that he had requested that the privileges of these officers be withdrawn so he could take their statements and conduct a search of their offices and residences for items of evidential value but this request was denied. Tsav averred that in his final report, he had concluded that there was enough circumstantial evidence to accuse the duo of Togun and Akilu of conspiracy to murder but still the government did not make these two officers available for interrogation or a voice identification as he had requested.Tsav claims that he handed the case file back to Chris Omeben. Tsav alleged that none of his recommendations were implemented, the case file was never returned to him and that there was no evidence that the case was transferred to another officer or agency. Tsav said he believed Giwa was killed because he believed Giwa was in \"the way of some powerful forces\".After the investigation stalled, various conspiracy theories arose to explain why Giwa was killed. One of the most popular and still the most enduring has been the Gloria Okon connection. Gloria Okon was a Lady who was arrested in 1985 at the Aminu Kano International airport on suspicion of drug smuggling. Soon after, it was alleged that she had died in custody, the government subsequently constituted a commission of inquiry to investigate the matter.Conspiracy theorists allege that Gloria Okon was a drug mule working for the wife of General Ibrahim Babangida who was then the Minister of Defence in the regime of General Muhammadu Buhari. The theorists allege that during interrogation Okon had claimed that she worked for highly placed Nigerians, in particular Babangida's wife. The theory goes on that Babangida spirited Okon out of detention to the United Kingdom, sold the public the ruse of a dead Gloria Okon and that Dele Giwa happened upon Okon on a trip to the UK where she told him her story. The story goes on that armed with this information, Giwa tried to blackmail the now Military President, Ibrahim Babangida and this was why he was killed. This blackmail theory might not be unconnected with the off-the-record interview that Lt Col A.K Togun gave to airport correspondents of the Guardian on 27 October 1986. In the interview, when asked about Dele Giwa's killing and the suspicion in the public that he was killed by the government, Togun was quoted as saying \"...one person cannot come out to blackmail us. I am an expert in blackmail. I can blackmail very well. I studied propaganda so no one person can come and blackmail us after an agreement...\". Togun's statement was in the context of the secret agreement reached by Giwa and other media executives at the 9 October meeting, he seemed to accuse Giwa of reneging on the agreement leading to Giwa being invited for questioning on 16 October. Theorists also allege that Babangida's drug running activities were brought to the attention of the Buhari-Idiagbon regime which led the regime to slate him for retirement on 1 October 1985. They also say that it was his impending retirement that inspired him to plan the coup that toppled Buhari in August 1985.Giwa's colleagues at Newswatch have debunked this theory and deny any link between Giwa, Gloria Okon and Mrs. Babangida. In a Newswatch interview marking the 25th anniversary of the magazine, one of the founding partners of the organisation Yakubu Mohammed explained the Giwa-Newswatch-Gloria Okon link.\nMohammed claims that Dele Giwa had not been writing any Gloria Okon story and that the closest Newswatch got to a Gloria Okon story was at one of the magazine's editorial conferences where a Newswatch reporter, Bose lasaki, who was a niece to President Olusegun Obasanjo spoke about a \"rumour\" making the rounds to the effect that Gloria Okon had not died in detention but had been spirited out of the country. Mohammed claimed that Lasaki's story was dismissed off-hand but that she was asked to find out more about the rumour. Lasaki was alleged to have returned for the next editorial conference the following week and declared that there was no substance to the rumour. Mohammed alleged that Giwa was not at any of these meetings. The Ibrahim Babangida drug running angle was also called into question by revelations made by the embittered former head of the National Security Organization (NSO), Alhaji Mohammed Lawal Rafindadi. In 1985, following a request by the Supreme Military Council, the NSO under Rafindadi investigated Babangida and found him complicit of forgery and activities inimical to national security. This issue arose as a result of Babangida and his in-law, Mr Sunny Okogwu's interest in an arms manufacturing venture in Kaduna called Black Gold. The SMC, based on the NSO's findings slated Babangida for retirement.\nThe only witness to the events shortly before the bomb exploded, Mr Kayode Soyinka had alleged that the package had a label with the seal of the Nigerian President and also claimed that the label indicated that it was from the office of the president. However, no other witness has corroborated this claim, Giwa's 17-year-old son, Billy, who had delivered the package to Giwa has never corroborated this claim. Soyinka's testimony about the events prior to and after the bombing have also been brought into question, there have been accusations made to the effect that he might have been the same person that detonated the bomb by remote control as he was not injured in the explosion.Soyinka is also alleged to have given conflicting accounts of the events to the Police and media outlets, he is also accused of fleeing the country while investigations were ongoing. To the accusation of fleeing the country, Soyinka has this to say in that his interview with The Nation (Saturday, 19 January 2013): \"Dele was very close to his mother. He did not joke with her at all. It was an honour for me to have met her. The last time I saw her was at Dele's burial in their village near Auchi, in Edo State. I was there live with my wife contrary to the erroneous story of Babangida's government's mischief makers who tried to deceive the Nigerian people in order to exonerate the government from the assassination of Dele Giwa, saying that I had fled the country. They deliberately spread all kinds of falsehood, ignoring even newspaper reports and pictures of myself and my wife in attendance at the burial. And mind you, how could I have fled the country? My wife and children were not in Nigeria with me when the bomb exploded, they had to take the next available flight to Nigeria to join me. Yet, Babangida's men said I fled the country. And my family and I remained in the country throughout the whole period of the controversy and burial arrangement. We returned to London together through the former British Caledonian Airways, through Muritala Mohammed Airport. There was no way we could have left quietly. We were accompanied to and seen off at the airport by friends, including the Newswatch editors, and family. The airline people recognised us. Our two children were still small then. The air hostesses took them from us, played with them, and they were asking me if I was feeling better \u2013 knowing the trauma one must have been through in the past weeks, and took us straight and right inside the aircraft, even before checking in other passengers. Yet the Babangida men kept saying, even till today, that I fled the country. Can you imagine?\"Giwa's lawyer was also accused of prematurely accusing the government of Dele Giwa's murder thereby truncating the investigation into the case, Newswatch magazine in an edition of 18 November 1986, disowned Fawehimni.The subsequent court cases instituted by Fawehinmi against the government to enable him try the case as a private prosecutor after the Director of Public Prosecution, Mrs. Eniola Fadayomi had refused to prosecute based on the evidence available were mostly unsuccessful. An excerpt of the Judgement by the then Lagos State Chief Judge, Justice Candido Johnson reads thus \"...Even if one considers the reasonableness of time, I would say that the incident that gave birth to the death of the late Dele Giwa is not only unique in its form but also complex and would require sufficient time to conduct detailed and balanced investigation, a report on which the appropriate authority would reasonably act. The timing here appears hasty and premature. It appears impulsive without giving reasonable time and chance for a detailed and balanced investigation into this sordid incident.\nIn the circumstances and having regard to the review made above, it is my ruling that this (ex-parte) application is misconceived and it is therefore dismissed. Leave to apply for mandamus is hereby refused.\"Fawehinmi went on to the Supreme Court and got a favourable judgement which enabled him go back to the Lagos State High Court, this judgement also mandated the Justice Candido to recuse himself from the case and appoint another judge to hear the case. On 23 February 1988, Justice Longe ruled that the two security officers, Lt. Col Tunde Togun and Col. Haliru Akilu could not be tried for the murder of Dele Giwa. In his ruling Justice Longe averred among other things that,\"...the Attorney general did not oppose the objection raised by counsel to the 'accused' persons, Chief Rotimi Williams, on the ground that the information was filed by private prosecutor (Chief Gani Fawehinmi) when the information had not been completed and especially when the 'INFORMATION IMPLICATED ONE OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES'(Kayode Soyinka)...the proof of evidence before the Court was mere HEARSAY\u2026. Based on the evidence available before the court, it will be an abuse of the process of court to call the two security chiefs for trial. The information is therefore quashed accordingly.\" Kayode Soyinka was represented in court by Kayode Sofola SAN, representing the chambers of Kehinde Sofola SAN, that succeeded to getting the court to rule as frivolous the reference to Soyinka being \"implicated\". The court also ordered that cost be paid Soyinka by the 'accused' persons.In 2001, General Ibrahim Babangida refused to testify before a national human rights commission about the Giwa murder. Babangida, Hakilu and Togun went to court and obtained an order restraining the commission from summoning them to appear before it. The Chairman of the commission commented that the commission had the power to issue arrest warrants for the trio but decided against this \"in the over-all interest of national reconciliation\".In 2008, the Government of Nigeria named a street in the New Federal Capital Abuja after Dele Giwa, as they did with other activists such as Fela Anikulapo-Kuti and Ken Saro Wiwa"

Ferdinand, Elisabeth and their three children lived until November 1915 on rue Moli\u00e8re in La Roche-sur-Yon, before settling in the Paris region of Coulommiers. The writer Dominique Duviard (1940\u20131983), was a grandson of Ferdinand Duviard; he contributed a preface to a modern reprint of Ferdinand's book Les Cotillons barr\u00e9s.\nThe couple divorced in 1924, and he remarried Anna Marie Marsan (1906\u20131960) the following year.

L. Zamenhof, the father of Esperanto. Bourlet's wife, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Marie Adam (1872\u20131923), was the sister of Duviard's first wife Elisabeth Antoinette Adam."

The congress was cancelled because war was declared on 2 August 1914, the very day the Esperanto Congress was to have begun at the Gaumont Palace.During the First World War, Esperantists devoted great efforts to the search for soldiers missing in action and prisoners of war. In the January\u2013March 1916 issue of Juneco, an article entitled \"The French Press\" states: \"We find in the newspapers, of which we give names below, press releases on Esperanto and on various services rendered by Esperantists since the war began. We sincerely thank the said newspapers, as well as the Esperantist friends who have submitted these items.\"Under the headline \"A success of Esperanto,\" the 9 August 1915, issue of the newspaper La Petite Gironde highlighted the efforts of Esperantists concerning the search for the missing and the results obtained. La France de Bordeaux wrote: \"The La Roche-sur-Yon group produced such results that the Nantes group will organize a similar service.\" Le Temps of 18 August published separate press releases from the La Roche Esperanto group and from the Le Mans Esperanto club on the issue of soldiers missing in action."

Lenz became a professional musician when he played keyboards and flute for the soft-rock bands Seals and Crofts and Loggins and Messina touring around the world, performing before large audiences, and recording. Lenz' involvement in children's issues stems partly from having seven children of his own, as well as being in an arena which avoids \"the conflict between what I believe about music and its sacred nature and dealing with what a lot of programming deals with, which sometimes could be the worst aspects of human nature.\"  Lenz joined the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in 1969."

After he found out he would not be frontrunner in the 2003 election, he quit the party and returned to his former post of public prosecutor.\n\nIn 2006, Teeven announced his return to politics, this time for the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). For the general election of 2006, he was sixth on the candidate list for the VVD; he was elected into House of Representatives on 30 November 2006. He was the main spokesperson for justice policy.\nFor the general election of 2010 he was third on the candidate list for the VVD. After the cabinet formation of 2010 for the First Rutte cabinet, Teeven became State Secretary for Security and Justice taking office on 14 October 2010 and resigned the same day as a member of the House of Representatives. On 5 November 2012, he continued as State Secretary for Security and Justice under the Second Rutte cabinet. Meanwhile, he was a member of the House of Representatives again from 20 September 2012 to 5 November 2012. As State Secretary for Security and Justice he was tasked with dealing with prevention, family law, youth justice, in addition to copyright law.On 10 March 2015 Justice Minister Ivo Opstelten resigned together with Teeven after the former had informed the House of Representatives wrongly in the early 2000s on a deal made by Teeven as a state prosecutor in 1994. The deal concerned money paid to a drug trafficker whose money had been seized and received compensation after the origin of the money could not be proved to be illegal. Opstelten had mentioned to the House of Representatives a lower amount than the one that was actually paid, as well as that the receipt of the transaction had gone missing, while it later surfaced. In the wake of this affair, House Speaker Anouchka van Miltenburg, a member of the same political party as both Teeven and Opstelten, resigned on 12 December 2015 when it became clear she had suppressed two letters of a whistleblower from the justice ministry who had already mentioned the right details on the deal, by putting the letters through the shredder. After resigning as State Secretary Teeven served as member of the House of Representatives between 26 March 2015 and 23 March 2017.Teeven currently works as a part-time bus driver for public transportation company Connexxion in North Holland and as a consultant for public relations and cybercrime.

He is most notable for his studies of radiant heat. He was one of the six founding members of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft at Berlin on 14 January 1845.\nKnoblauch's father was a well-to-do silk fabrics manufacturer in Berlin. Despite pressure from his father to enter the family business, Knoblauch in his early 20s opted to study mathematics and science at the University of Berlin. There he became one of the star students in the laboratory of Gustav Magnus. Knoblauch's doctorate, completed in Berlin in 1847, described valuable experiments that established some of the optical properties of radiant heat (a.k.a. infrared radiation). In an article describing these experiments Knoblauch wrote that experimental facts are \"the only permanent things in science\", while abstract models are \"transitory\" and should be treated with caution and kept separate from the facts, a view that Magnus maintained also.\nAs a researcher and teacher at the University of Marburg, 1849\u201353, he produced valuable experimental demonstrations about the nature of diamagnetism. Knoblauch's student and collaborator on the diamagnetism work was John Tyndall. Tyndall and Knoblauch maintained a correspondence on and off over the next 25 years.Knoblauch moved to the University of Halle in 1853, and remained there for the rest of his career. During his first few years at Halle he did not publish anything. Later his publications were still not as frequent as they had been before moving to Halle. In his Halle years, apart from science teaching and research, he also gave his time to various administrative functions in German science including being president for 17 years of the German Academy of Sciences. He was also the rector (chief administrative officer) of the University of Halle for a while.\nHis wife Elisabeth (1827\u20131855) died on September 12 due to complications from childbirth of their son Johannes, who was born on August 27."

Before embarking on a music career, White attended film school at New York University. Soon after finishing his lengthy thesis at the university, White entered a self-described \"deep hole of sickness and depression and poverty\". It was during this period that White began writing songs again after a long hiatus, many of which would appear on his debut album Wrong Eyed Jesus, released by David Byrne's boutique label Luaka Bop."

On Wrong-Eyed Jesus, folk singer Victoria Williams sings on the track \"Angel-Land\"; British electronica trio Morcheeba produced and played on three tracks on No Such Place alongside Sade keyboardist Andrew Hale, who produced three tracks on the same album. Aimee Mann, Barenaked Ladies, and jazz guitarist Bill Frisell appear on Drill a Hole in That Substrate and Tell Me What You See, which was produced by Joe Henry, Tucker Martine, and Jim White himself. In an interview with David Byrne, White described the making of the album.White's 2012 album Where It Hits You marked his first effort after an amicable parting of ways with Byrne's Luaka Bop. The record features guest appearances by members the roots group Olabelle, Terri Binion and Shak Nasty. Where It Hits You was released on the Yep Roc label.In 2017 White's album Waffles, Triangles & Jesus came out via the PIAPTK label in the US and Loose in the UK. White was joined by musical group Hog Eyed Man, Holly Golightly, and Cicada Rhythm.\nWhite's 2020 album Misfit's Jubilee marked a departure from his more solemn introspective previous work, featuring and upbeat collaboration with Belgian recording artists Geert Hellings and Nicolas Rombouts. White's longtime drummer Marlon Patton played drums on Misfit's Jubilee, as he did on White's previous four solo records.White's debut album Wrong Eyed Jesus is considered a minor classic in the Americana genre, and his fan base includes various entertainment luminaries such as David Byrne, Matt Groening, and Vince Gilligan. The song \"Wordmule\" appeared in the Breaking Bad episode \"Blood Money\", while \"Static on the Radio\" appeared in the end credits of El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie."

Dr. Fellowes, author of the Religion of the Universe and other works, and given over to Fonblanque's complete control. For 17 years up to 1847, he sustained the high character for political independence and literary ability that The Examiner had gained under the direction of Leigh Hunt and his brother John, and even compelled his political opponents to acknowledge some delight in the boldness and brightness of the wit he directed against them.\nWhen it was proposed that supporters of the paper should facilitate a reduction in its price by paying their subscriptions ten years in advance, they were joined by Edward Bulwer-Lytton and by Benjamin Disraeli, who was then flirting with radicalism. Fonblanque remained at the Examiner despite many offers of other literary employment, resolving to make it a standard of literary excellence in journalism.\nFonblanque entirely took over The Examiner in 1830, serving as editor until 1847. Among the contributors he found were John Stuart Mill, John Forster, William Makepeace Thackeray, and most notably Charles Dickens. Fonblanque wrote the first notice of Sketches by Boz (on 28 February 1836) and of The Pickwick Papers (on 4 September 1836). Forster became the magazine's literary editor in 1835, and succeeded Fonblanque as editor from 1847 to 1855. Fonblanque retained ownership until 1865. The magazine ceased publication in 1886."

It was not uncommon at the time for boys to be named with initials, and he was simply called \"W. A.\". In later years when a full name was required for his passport Criswell supplied his father's first and middle names. Criswell grew up in Texline in Dallam County, the most northwesterly community in the Texas Panhandle, where his cowboy-barber father moved the family in 1915.At age ten, young W. A. professed faith in Christ at a revival meeting led by the evangelist Reverend John Hicks. Two years later Criswell publicly committed his life to the gospel ministry.  Criswell was licensed to preach at the age of seventeen and soon thereafter held part-time pastorates at Devil's Bend and Pulltight, Texas. While attending Baylor University in Waco, Texas, from 1928 to 1931 he ministered in Marlow, White Mound, and  Pecan Grove, the latter in Fort Bend County, Texas. During his graduate and post-graduate years, including a Ph.D. at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, Criswell was the pastor of Baptist churches in Mount Washington in Bullitt County near Louisville and Oakland in Warren County near Bowling Green, Kentucky.  After completing his degrees, Criswell in 1937 accepted the pastorate of the First Baptist Church of Chickasha in Grady County in central Oklahoma. In 1941, he moved to First Baptist Church of Muskogee in eastern Oklahoma. In 1935, Criswell married the former Bessie Marie \"Betty\" Harris (1913\u20132006), the pianist of the Mount Washington church and an education graduate of Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green. Their daughter Mabel Ann was born in Chickasha in 1939. Mabel Ann possessed an exceptional operatic voice and recorded three albums of sacred music in the late 1960s and early 1970s, two with the Ralph Carmichael orchestra. She died in 2002, some six months after her father's passing."

He would spend the remainder of his life at First Baptist, preaching more than four thousand sermons from its pulpit. During his pastorship membership grew from 7,800 to 26,000, with weekly Sunday School attendance in excess of 5,000. The church expanded to multiple buildings covering five blocks in downtown Dallas, eventually becoming the largest Southern Baptist church in the world. The popular evangelist Billy Graham joined the church in 1953, became a close friend of the Criswell family, and remained a member of the Dallas congregation for 55 years.\nCriswell was part of the pioneering movement in the modern megachurch phenomenon.  He was also a visionary, who introduced a number of innovations at First Baptist Dallas that became a model for growing churches all over the country.  By the early 1950s he had hired professionally trained educational directors for each age group of the church, organized a sophisticated multi-level Sunday School program, added a full-time business manager to the staff, and broadened the church into a youth and family life center featuring a bowling alley, skating rink, and gymnasium with a track and basketball court.  He greatly expanded the church's long-standing Silent Friends ministry, creating for the deaf their own Sunday School, Training Union, Vacation Bible School, and summer camp ministries. His vigorous outreach efforts to the community included sponsoring thirty-seven inner city missions, a crisis pregnancy center, the Good Shepherd and Dallas Life Foundation ministries for the homeless and disadvantaged, Spanish-language chapels, and extensive television and radio ministries.  Church services were locally televised as early as January 1951 and eventually were carried on stations nationwide.\nCriswell's accomplishments include helping to engineer the conservative resurgence of the Southern Baptist convention, a transition  which began in the late 1970s. He was awarded eight honorary doctorates in addition to his earned postgraduate degree.  He published fifty-four books, including an annotated Criswell Study Bible (in later editions the Believers Study Bible and Holy Bible, Baptist Study Edition, Thomas Nelson Publishers), and founded both Criswell College with its radio station KCBI, and First Baptist Academy.\nAt Criswell's request in 1988 a search committee was formed to identify and call a new pastor.  On Thanksgiving Sunday evening 1990 First Baptist called Joel C. Gregory as pastor, following the unanimous recommendation of the pastor search committee and the deacons. Gregory became pastor while Criswell took the title \"Senior Pastor.\"  At the Wednesday evening service on September 30, 1992, Gregory announced his resignation, indicating that the intended succession of Criswell had not taken place. Gregory subsequently wrote Too Great a Temptation (Summit Group, 1994) describing his experiences during this period.\nIn 1993 First Baptist called O. S. Hawkins as pastor and Criswell entered semi-retirement as pastor emeritus. He continued to preach at conferences, First Baptist's annual pre-Easter series, Sunday school and college lectures, and occasional Sunday morning messages for the remainder of the decade."

Warren stood in line to shake hands with Criswell afterwards.\nWhen my turn finally arrived, something unexpected happened. Criswell looked at me with kind, loving eyes and said, quite emphatically, \"Young man, I feel led to lay hands on you and pray for you!\" He placed his hands on my head and prayed: \"Father, I ask that you give this young preacher a double portion of your Spirit.

Bless him greatly, O Lord.\"\nWarren went on to found the Saddleback Church in California, one of the most recognized ecumenical churches in the country, with weekly attendance in excess of 20,000.

He served there for 18 months, arriving in March 1845 (his wife followed shortly after, when appropriate accommodation was found, and his sister in law Emma S. Bacon, and mother in law, Mrs. Bacon, arrived one year later). He was able to work on restoring peace and order and in doing so, he earned a promotion to the consulate at Shanghai.Alcock, along with his wife, Henrietta, sister-in-law, and mother-in-law, moved to Shanghai in the fall of 1846, where they were part of a burgeoning community of expats, merchants and missionaries from England, France, and North America. Alcock made it a special part of his duties to superintend the established Chinese government and lay out the British settlement, which had developed into such an important feature of British commercial life in China. This included initially hosting a small church in his home, which his sister in law described as \"...an immense rambling Chinese House containing fifty two Rooms / surrounded by courtyards, and divided by Galleries and Passages in all directions\". In April 1847 it was, however, decided to apply to the Church Missionary Society for a Clergyman and to plan and build a church on land donated by a merchant, and it appears that Rutherford was heavily involved in this initiative.Emma S. Bacon, Alcock's sister-in-law, writes in April 1847, that the consulate was about two miles from Alcock's house and was to be built on ground \"...by the River Side appropriated to the English...but as it is not yet commenced, it is uncertain when we shall inhabit it + but on the site appropriated for the Building Rutherford has at present Offices and a pretty sitting Room for our use, opening into a garden very nicely arranged...\".In 1853 Alcock's wife, Henrietta died (March), and the Taiping rebellion reached Shanghai. The city was besieged and attacked until February 1855 when the rebels were starved and burned out of the city. Alcock remained in Shanghai until April of that year to restore peace and order, and then moved on to the Consulate in Canton, the original seat of much unrest in the 1840s. He was stationed in Canton for 1 year and then took a furlough to return home to England in October 1856, just before tensions once again ignited in Canton."

Although these men were bound by personal friendship, national rivalries and differences in dealing with the Japanese led to conflict and antagonism. However, the chaotic and ungovernable circumstances of the first few years forced them to cooperate.Alcock opened the second British legation in Japan within the grounds of T\u014dzen-ji in Takanawa, Edo (now Tokyo), the first being at Hiogo (Kobe), under Sir Harry Parkes and the vice-consul Frank Gerard Myberg (also known as Francis Gerard Mijburg and Frans Gerard Mijberg, died 18 January 1868 buried at Kobe).  He saw\n\n\"peace, plenty, apparent content, and a country more perfectly cultivated and kept, with more ornamental timber everywhere, than can be matched even in England\", Sir Rutherford Alcock, 1860.\nIn those days, foreign residents in Japan faced some danger, with noticeable Japanese hostility to foreigners (sonn\u014d j\u014di).

At the same time, he often fails to endear himself to his fellow detectives, who resent his black-and-white attitude toward the job and his arrogant demeanor.\nFrank's religious faith is tested in the three-part premiere of Season 3 when he investigates a series of killings that are revealed to have been religiously motivated. The thought that God can allow such crimes to be committed greatly disturbs Frank, and he chooses to renounce his faith, refusing even to go to church until near the end of Season 5.\nIn Season 3, Pembleton is asked by Deputy Commissioner James C. Harris to help Congressman Jeremy Wade cover up a homosexual liaison by dismissing a report that he was kidnapped. Pembleton reaches an agreement with Wade to admit the report was false, but word gets to the press and accusations of a cover-up costs Wade an election. When confronted, Pembleton looks to Harris, who denies that he sanctioned any agreement, and Al Giardello (who was deliberately kept in the dark) can offer no help. Disgusted with the situation, Pembleton throws down his badge and quits. However, his intuitive attitude towards his work meshes poorly with his home life, and he annoys Mary to the point that she gently pressures him to go back to work, which he eventually does. Pembleton is later called to testify about the cover-up and reluctantly states that he decided to offer Wade the deal on his own; however, he continues to harbor a deep resentment for Harris long after the incident is closed.\nExcept for target practice in Season 4 and re-certification training in Season 5, Frank never fires his gun during the course of the series. It is implied on a few occasions that he is in fact unwilling to use deadly force, which becomes significant during the two-part finale of Season 6."

Here's why. Six people sat in the Lake Avenue Studio of the Federation for the Advancement of Minority Artists (FAMA) on a recent morning. The talk turned to their professional life. Joe Montell, executive director of FAMA, acted as host. The guests were: Josephine Toussaint, Don Davis, Joseph Taylor, Robert Earl Sawyer and Marlene Labat. Quotations by Robert E. Sawyer:\nIt's not a problem being black - the problem rests with the undeveloped mentality of those who are in a position to make a moral and intellectual decision about the fundamental equality of minorities. And by having this malfunction they deny the literary and screen world the right to enjoy other cultures and musical and writing geniuses. And at the other side, the lethargy of the black businessman - and the lack of support of black people - also have contributed to the demise and decimation of black talent. It seems to be an unholy union of white discrimination and black lethargy. But the problem is 'not' being black."

At the same time, in an unofficial capacity Starr became involved in the conditioning of horses. As an unlicensed trainer his first win in 1936 was not formally recognized as were the wins of other horses he trained between then and 1952 when he applied for his license.\nYonnie Starr earned his first Canadian Horse of the Year honors in 1955 with Ace Marine, a colt whose wins included the three races that four years later were officially designated as the Canadian Triple Crown series. In all, Starr won ten official Triple Crown Classics including four Queen's Plates. His horses earned ten Sovereign Awards and won a record seven Canadian Horse of the Year titles: Ace Marine (1955), Wonder Where (1959), Fanfreluche (1970), La Prevoyante (1972), L'Enjoleur (1974, 1975), L'Alezane (1977). Seven of the horses he trained were inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame with one of them also elected to the U.S. United States Racing Hall of Fame.Although Starr trained horses of both sexes, he was recognized as someone who also had a special talent to develop fillies. During his career he trained horses with great success for prominent owners such as Conn Smythe and Larkin Maloney, both individually and for the Smythe/Maloney racing partnership. In the 1970s and 1980s Starr continued as a dominant force in Canadian racing as the trainer for Quebec sportsman, Jean-Louis Levesque. In addition to training for others, he owned a few horses and notably trained Unbranded who won the 1954 Jockey Club Cup Handicap.\nYonnie Starr trained horses until his death in Florida in March 1990 at age eighty-four. At the time, he had been racing for the winter season at Gulfstream Park.\n\n\n== References =="

He took part in the proceedings against Bacon for corruption, and was manager for the House of Commons in the impeachment of Edward Floyd for insulting the elector and electress palatine.On 1 November 1625 he was made Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; in this capacity, he delivered Charles I's reprimand to the Commons on 9 March 1626, when he declared that \"liberty of counsel\" alone belonged to them and not \"liberty of control\". On 10 April 1628 he received the title of Baron Coventry of Aylesborough in Worcestershire. At the opening of parliament in 1628, he threatened that the king would use his prerogative if further thwarted in the matter of supplies. In the subsequent debates, however, while strongly supporting the king's prerogative against the claims of the parliament to executive power, he favoured a policy of moderation and compromise. He defended the right of the council in special circumstances to commit people to prison without showing cause, and to issue general warrants. He disapproved of the king's sudden dissolution of parliament, and agreed to the liberation on bail of the seven imprisoned members on condition of their giving security for their good behaviour.He showed less subservience than Bacon to the Duke of Buckingham, and his resistance to the latter's pretensions to the office of Lord High Constable greatly incensed the duke. Buckingham taunted Coventry with having gained his place by his favour; Coventry replied, \"Did I conceive I had my place by your favour, I would presently unmake myself by returning the seal to his Majesty\". After this defiance Buckingham's sudden death alone probably prevented Coventry's displacement.He passed sentence of death on Lord Audley in 1631, drafted and enforced the proclamation of 20 June 1632 ordering the country gentlemen to leave London, and in 1634 joined in William Laud's attack on the Earl of Portland for peculation. The same year, in an address to the judges, he supported the proposed levy of ship money on the inland as well as the maritime counties on the plea of the necessity of effectually arming, \"so that they might not be enforced to fight\", \"the wooden walls\" being in his opinion \"the best walls of this kingdom\". He voted in Star Chamber in 1633 to remove the Irish judge  Lord Sarsfield from office for corruption, censuring him severely for hearing a murder case in private and for bullying the jury into returning a guilty verdict.In the Star Chamber Coventry was one of John Lilburne's judges in 1637, but he generally showed conspicuous moderation, inclining to leniency in the cases of Richard Chambers in 1629 for seditious speeches, and of Henry Sherfield in 1632 for breaking painted glass in a church. He prevented also the hanging of men for resistance to impressment, and pointed out its illegality, since the men were not subject to martial law. While contributing thirty horse to the Scottish expedition in 1638, and lending the king \u00a310,000 in 1639, he gave no support to the forced loan levied upon the city in the latter year."

Bulstrode Whitelocke accuses him of mediocrity, but his contemporaries in general have united in extolling his judicial ability, his quick despatch of business and his sound and sterling character. Clarendon in particular praises his statesmanship, and compares his capacity with Lord Strafford's, adding, however, that he seldom spoke in the council except on legal business and had little influence in political affairs; to the latter circumstance, he owed his exceptional popularity. He describes him as having \"in the plain way of speaking and delivery a strange power of making himself believed\", as a man of \"not only firm gravity but a severity and even some morosity\", as \"rather exceedingly liked than passionately loved\"."

Like his sisters Anna (1905\u20132000), Rita (1909\u20132012), a scientist, and Paola (1909\u20132000), a painter, he took the surname Levi-Montalcini. In Turin he studied at the Liceo Classico Massimo D'Azeglio, and took private courses in drawing and sculpture. He graduated in 1925 from the Royal School of Engineering in Turin (now the Polytechnic University of Turin).\nIn the 1920s and 30s in Turin, he associated with a wide circle of intellectuals and artists which included architects, painters and art critics, including Giuseppe Pagano, Edoardo Persico, Felice Casorati, Gigi Chessa, Henry Paolucci, Umberto Cuzzi, Domenico Morelli, Mario Passanti, and Carlo Mollino.\nHis collaboration with Giuseppe Pagano, a classmate who was six years older, marks the beginning of his career as an architect, with projects that place him among the first and most important representatives of the rationalist movement in Italy. The Palazzo Gualino office building they designed for the financier Riccardo Gualino drew an immediate response at the international level. Other projects designed by the two architects were publicized and analyzed by critics, in particular through the pages of Casabella and Domus.\nHe moved to Milan after the separation from Pagano. Among the most important works of this period is the Colonia elioterapica di Bardonecchia (1936\u201338). He and his family were affected by the anti-Jewish laws in 1938. After Jews were banned from university posts and the practice of medicine, he helped his sister assemble a secret laboratory in her bedroom at their parents' house in Turin so she could continue her medical research.In 1943 he married Maria Gattone. In 1944 they had a son Emanuele, and in 1946 a daughter Piera. From 1943 to 1945 he was displaced to Florence, where he was able to escape anti-Jewish persecution under a false name.\nAfter the end of the Second World War he returned to Turin, and in 1946 joined the Giuseppe Pagano Group and the local branch of APAO, engaging with issues of postwar reconstruction and new tasks of architecture.\nIn the 1950s he worked on numerous projects. He focused on higher education and increasing participation in competitions for major works, including (in collaboration with colleagues Domenico Morelli, Felice Bardelli and Sergio Hutter) the project for a new building for the University of Turin.\nHe also designed furniture and decor, starting with 67 pieces of furniture for the Palazzo Gualino and including furnishings of important public buildings, such as the Hall of the Press in Turin, in shops, including the Borletti in Galleria San Federico, and for exhibitions.\nHe remained a sculptor, for which he had an early vocation, and made drawings, portraits and caricatures. His sculptures and portraits in pen and oil are reminiscent of those of Pagano, Mollino, and other architects from Turin.\nHis academic career began at the Polytechnic of Turin, where he was a lecturer in architectural composition from 1948 to 1956. He served as a professor at the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Palermo from 1956 to 1964, at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Padua from 1964 to 1971, and to Turin in 1971\u201372.\nHe was President of the Council of the Order of Architects of the Province of Turin in 1969\u201370, and in 1969 was appointed a member of the National Academy of St. Luke.\nGino Levi-Montalcini died in Turin on November 29, 1974. He was 72."

He was probably born in the early part of the 5th century, and succeeded Gelsimus as bishop of Toul around 478. After more than 500 years in the Roman Empire, the city of Toul (capital of the Leuci) had fallen under the power of Francia, and Auspicius was thus the first of the bishops of Toul to serve under the Franks.\nSidonius died around 485, and it is likely that Auspicius died a few years later (perhaps about 490). His successor was the bishop Saint Ours. He was buried in the burial ground of St. Mansuy."

He was a friend of the poet Sidonius Apollinaris, bishop of Clermont, and of Count Arbogast, the governor of Trier for Childeric I, and the three exchanged correspondence.Arbogast wrote to Sidonius asking him to instruct him in his duties and to give some explanation of the sacred books but Sidonius apologized and referred him to Saint Loup, Bishop of Troyes, or to Auspicius, bishop of Toul, both distinguished by their deep knowledge and high rank. The Count approached Auspicius, who sent him a highly complimentary reply in verse. The letter was written sometime created between 460 and 475. In it Auspicius praised Arbogast because of his Latin language skills.  He also hinted at the end of Roman rule.  \" ... as long as you live and speak, though the Latin rule has fallen on the frontier, the (Latin) words do not waver. \" He praised the high descent and noble disposition of the prince.  He was greater than his ancestor of the same name, because he died as a pagan, but Arbogast was Christian.  He also warns him against greed. Confident that Arbogast takes this to heart, Auspicius saw him as a future bishop. In fact, he may have possibly later  become Bishop of Chartres.  Finally, he exhorts him to meet Bishop Jamblichus of Trier.\nThe text is written in poem form of 164 iambic dimeters.  He is considered an early example of rhythmic anthemstrophy, in the word accent prevails. As a poet, he was the first Westerner to adopt the iambic rhythm derived from the Saturnian metre, the preferred metre of Roman folk and secular poetry. The poem is preserved in a collection of various writings written or sent in Austrasia, which was compiled in 585.  The only surviving manuscript is Cod. Vaticano-Palatinus 869 s.IX"

        "content": "Isabella of France (c.\u20091295 \u2013 22 August 1358), sometimes described as the She-Wolf of France (French: Louve de France), was Queen of England as the wife of King Edward II, and de facto regent of England from 1327 until 1330. She was the youngest surviving child and only surviving daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. Isabella was notable in her lifetime for her diplomatic skills, intelligence, and beauty. She overthrew her husband, becoming a \"femme fatale\" figure in plays and literature over the years, usually portrayed as a beautiful but cruel and manipulative figure.\nIsabella arrived in England at age 12 during a period of growing conflict between the king and the powerful baronial factions. Her new husband was notorious for the patronage he lavished on his favourite, Piers Gaveston, but the queen supported Edward during these early years, forming a working relationship with Piers and using her relationship with the French monarchy to bolster her own authority and power. After the death of Gaveston at the hands of the barons in 1312, however, Edward turned to a new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and attempted to take revenge on the barons, resulting in the Despenser War and a period of internal repression across England. Isabella could not tolerate Hugh Despenser, and by 1325, her marriage to Edward was at a breaking point.\nTravelling to France on a diplomatic mission, Isabella may have begun an affair with Roger Mortimer, and the two may possibly have agreed at this point to depose Edward and oust the Despenser family. The Queen returned to England with a small mercenary army in 1326, moving rapidly across England. The King's forces deserted him. Isabella deposed Edward, becoming regent on behalf of her young son, Edward III. Some believe that Isabella then arranged the murder of Edward II. Isabella and Mortimer's regime began to crumble, partly because of her lavish spending, but also because the Queen successfully, but unpopularly, resolved long-running problems such as the war with Scotland.\nIn 1330, aged 18, Isabella's son, Edward III forcibly asserted his authority. Mortimer was executed, Isabella's regency was ended and she was imprisoned, but soon released.  She lived out her remaining years as a wealthy courtier and grew close again to her family especially her daughter Joan, Queen of Scots and her grandson  Edward, Prince of Wales."

        "title": "Isabella of France_p0",
        "content": "Isabella was born in Paris on an uncertain date\u2014on the basis of the chroniclers and the eventual date of her marriage, she was probably born between April 1295 and January 1296. She is described as born in 1292 in the Annals of Wigmore, and Piers Langtoft agrees, claiming that she was 7 years old in 1299. The French chronicler Guillaume de Nangis and English chronicler Thomas Walsingham describe her as 12 years old at the time of her marriage in January 1308, placing her birth between January 1295 and of 1296. A papal dispensation by Clement V in November 1305 permitted her immediate marriage by proxy, despite the fact that she was probably only 10 years old. Since her brother Charles was born on 18 June 1294, and she had to reach the canonical age of 12 before her marriage in January 1308, the evidence suggests that she was born between April 1295 and January 1296. Her parents were King Philip IV of France and Queen Joan I of Navarre; her brothers Louis, Philip and Charles became kings of France.Isabella was born into a royal family that ruled the most powerful state in Western Europe. Her father, King Philip, known as \"le Bel\" (the Fair) because of his alleged good looks, was a strangely unemotional man; one contemporary described him as \"neither a man nor a beast, but a statue\"; modern historians have noted that he \"cultivated a reputation for Christian kingship and showed few weaknesses of the flesh\". Philip built up centralised royal power in France, engaging in a sequence of conflicts to expand or consolidate French authority across the region, but remained chronically short of money throughout his reign. Indeed, he appeared almost obsessed about building up wealth and lands, something that his daughter was also accused of in later life. Isabella's mother died when Isabella was still quite young; some contemporaries suspected Philip IV of her murder, albeit probably incorrectly.\nIsabella was brought up in and around the Louvre Palace and the Palais de la Cit\u00e9 in Paris. Isabella was cared for by Th\u00e9ophania de Saint-Pierre, her nurse, given a good education and taught to read, developing a love of books. As was customary for the period, all of Philip's children were married young for political benefit. Isabella was promised in marriage by her father to Edward, the son of King Edward I of England, with the intention to resolve the conflicts between France and England over the latter's continental possession of Gascony and claims to Anjou, Normandy and Aquitaine. Pope Boniface VIII had urged the marriage as early as 1298 but it was delayed by wrangling over the terms of the marriage contract. The renewal of the Anglo-French truce in 1299 led to the marriage of Edward I to Philip's sister Margaret, further anticipating the marriage of Isabella to Edward II. In 1303, Edward I may have considered a Castilian bride for Edward II instead of Isabella and even increased her dowry before the wedding. Edward I attempted to break the engagement several times for political advantage, and only after he died in 1307 did the wedding proceed.Isabella and Edward II were finally married at Boulogne-sur-Mer on 25 January 1308. Isabella's wardrobe gives some indications of her wealth and style\u2014she had dresses of baudekyn, velvet, taffeta and cloth, along with numerous furs; she had over 72 headdresses and coifs; she brought with her two gold crowns, gold and silver dinnerware and 419 yards of linen. At the time of her marriage, Isabella was probably about twelve and was described by Geoffrey of Paris as \"the beauty of beauties... in the kingdom if not in all Europe.\" This description was probably not simply flattery by a chronicler, since both Isabella's father and brothers were considered very handsome men by contemporaries, and her husband was to nickname her \"Isabella the Fair\". Isabella was said to resemble her father, and not her mother, queen regnant of Navarre, a plump, plain woman. This indicates that Isabella was slender and pale-skinned, although the fashion at the time was for blonde, slightly full-faced women, and Isabella may well have followed this stereotype instead. Throughout her career, Isabella was noted as charming and diplomatic, with a particular skill at convincing people to follow her courses of action. Unusual for the medieval period, contemporaries also commented on her high intelligence."

        "content": "As queen, the young Isabella faced numerous challenges. Edward was handsome, but also to have possibly formed close romantic attachments first to Piers Gaveston and then to Hugh Despenser the Younger. Edward found himself at odds with the barons, too, in particular his first cousin Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, whilst continuing the war against the Scots that he had inherited from Edward I. Using her own supporters at court and the patronage of her French family, Isabella attempted to find a political path through these challenges. She successfully formed an alliance with Gaveston, but after his death at the hands of the barons, her position grew increasingly precarious. Edward began to take revenge on his enemies, using an ever more brutal alliance with the Despenser family, in particular his new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger. By 1326, Isabella found herself increasingly at odds with both Edward and Hugh, ultimately resulting in Isabella's own bid for power and an invasion of England."

With her lands in England seized, her children taken away from her and her household staff arrested, Isabella began to pursue other options. When her brother, King Charles IV of France, seized Edward's French possessions in 1325, she returned to France, initially as a delegate of the King charged with negotiating a peace treaty between the two nations. However, her presence in France became a focal point for the many nobles opposed to Edward's reign. Isabella gathered an army to oppose Edward, in alliance with Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, whom she may have taken as a lover. Isabella and Mortimer returned to England with a mercenary army, seizing the country in a lightning campaign. The Despensers were executed and Edward was forced to abdicate\u2014his eventual fate and possible murder remains a matter of considerable historical debate. Isabella ruled as regent until 1330 when her son Edward deposed Mortimer and began to rule directly in his own right."

The Synod or Convention of Drumceat in 584 AD was called to pass new laws to keep control of the ollams. Geoffrey Keating's History of Ireland states that St Columba or Columcille interceded on their behalf as follows:\n\"'I do not wish to keep the fil\u00e9s,' said the king, 'so unjust are their demands and so numerous are they. For there are usually thirty in the train of an ollamh, and fifteen in that of an anroth, and so on for the other grades of the fil\u00e9 down to the lowest.' Each of them used to have a separate train of attendants according to his degree, so that nearly the third of the men of Ireland followed the bardic profession. Columcille said to the king that it was right to set aside many of the fil\u00e9s, as they were so numerous. But he advised him to maintain a fil\u00e9 as his own chief ollamh after the example of the kings who went before him, and that each provincial king should have an ollamh, and, moreover, that each lord of a cantred or district in Ireland should have an ollamh, and Columcille proposed this plan and Aodh assented to it; From this regulation, which was made by Aodh, son of Ainmire, and Columcille, it followed that the king of Ireland and every provincial king and every lord of a cantred had a special ollamh, and that each of these ollamhs had free land from his own lord, and, moreover, the lands and worldly possessions of each of these ollamhs enjoyed general exemption and sanctuary from the men of Ireland. It was also ordained that a common estate should be set apart for the ollamhs where they could give public instruction after the manner of a University, such as Raith Cheannait and Masruidhe Mhuighe Sleacht, in Breithfne, where they gave free instruction in the sciences to the men of Ireland, as many as desired to become learned in seanchus and in the other sciences that were in vogue in Ireland at that time. The ardollamh of Ireland at that time was Eochaidh Eigeas, son of Oilill, son of Earc, and it was he who was called Dall\u00e1n Forgaill, and he sent out ollamhs and set them over the provinces of Ireland, namely, Aodh Eigeas over the district of Breagh and over Meath, Urmhaol chief eigeas over the two provinces of Munster, Sanchan, son of Cuairfheartach, over the province of Connaught, and Fear Firb, son of Muireadhach, son of Mongan, in the ollamhship of Ulster; and, moreover, an ollamh in every cantred in Ireland under these high ollamhs, and they were to have free land from their territorial chiefs, as well as sanctuary, as we have said; and each of them was to get certain rewards for their poems and compositions.\""

The actor stated that the role allowed him to play tougher than he is in real life and commented that it \"gives you a bit of a rush.\" Johnstone-Burt garnered a nomination for an Out of the Box award from the Inside Film Awards.A week before he graduated from NIDA, Johnstone-Burt was approached to play the brain damaged Fish Lamb in the television adaptation of Tim Winton's Cloudstreet. After attending the audition, the actor believed he had done a good enough job to secure the role. He told a The Daily Telegraph reporter, \"I supposed I walked out thinking I did a good job \u2013 seeing how I worked with [director Matthew Saville] and taking his direction. Then I had to sit by my phone for a month and hopefully get a call.\" To prepare for the role, Johnstone-Burt visited a home for people with intellectual disabilities and he then spent four months shooting the miniseries in Western Australia.For his performance in Cloudstreet, the actor earned nominations for Best New Talent and Most Outstanding Performance by an Actor at the 2012 ASTRA Awards.

Basu invented simple examples that displayed some difficulties of likelihood-based statistics and frequentist statistics; Basu's paradoxes were especially important in the development of survey sampling. In statistical theory, Basu's theorem established the independence of a complete sufficient statistic and an ancillary statistic.Basu was associated with the Indian Statistical Institute in India, and Florida State University in the United States."

        "content": "Debabrata Basu was born in Dacca, Bengal, unpartitioned India, now Dhaka, Bangladesh. His father, N. M. Basu, was a mathematician specialising in number theory. Young Basu studied mathematics at Dacca University. He took a course in statistics as part of the under-graduate honours programme in Mathematics but his ambition was to become a pure mathematician. After getting his master's degree from Dacca University, Basu taught there from 1947 to 1948.Following the partition of India in 1947, Basu made several trips to India. In 1948, he moved to Calcutta, where he worked for some time as an actuary in an insurance company. In 1950, he joined the Indian Statistical Institute as a research scholar under C.R. Rao.In 1950, the Indian Statistical Institute was visited by Abraham Wald, who was giving a lecture tour sponsored by the International Statistical Institute. Wald greatly impressed Basu. Wald had developed a decision-theoretic foundations for statistics in which Bayesian statistics was a central part, because of Wald's theorem characterising admissible decision rules as Bayesian decision rules (or limits of Bayesian decision rules). Wald also showed the power of using measure-theoretic probability theory in statistics.\nHe married Kalyani Ray in 1952 and subsequently had two children, Monimala (Moni) Basu and Shantanu Basu. Moni is a journalism professor at the University of Florida and former CNN reporter, and Shantanu is an astrophysicist at the University of Western Ontario.In 1953, after submitting his thesis to the University of Calcutta, Basu went as a Fulbright scholar to the University of California, Berkeley. There Basu had intensive discussions with Jerzy Neyman and \"his brilliant younger colleagues\" like Erich Leo Lehmann. Basu's theorem comes from this time. Basu thus had a good understanding of the decision-theoretic approach to statistics of Neyman, Pearson and Wald. In fact, Basu is described as having returned from Berkeley to India as a \"complete Neyman Pearsonian\" by J. K. Ghosh.Basu met Ronald Fisher in the winter of 1954\u20131955; he wrote in 1988, \"With his reference set argument, Sir Ronald was trying to find a via media between the two poles of Statistics \u2013 Berkeley and Bayes. My efforts to understand this Fisher compromise led me to the likelihood principle\". In their festschrift for Basu, the editors Malay Ghosh and Patak write that\n\n[Basu's] critical examination of both the Neyman\u2013Pearsonian and the Fisherian modes of inference eventually forced him to a Bayesian point of view, via the likelihood route. The final conversion to Bayesianism came in January 1968, when Basu was invited to speak at a Bayesian Session in the Statistics Section of the Indian Science Congress. He confesses that, while preparing for these lectures, he became convinced that Bayesian inference did indeed provide one with a logical resolution of the underlying inconsistencies of both the Neyman\u2013Pearson and the Fisherian theories. Since then, Dr. Basu became an ardent Bayesian and, in many of his foundation papers, pointed out the deficiencies of both the Neyman\u2013Pearsonian and the Fisherian methods. \nAfter 1968, Basu began writing polemical essays, which provided paradoxes to frequentist statistics, and which produced great discussion in statistical journals and at statistical meetings. Particularly stimulating papers were Basu's papers on the foundations of survey sampling. There is an extensive literature discussing Basu's problem of estimating the weight of the elephants at a circus with an enormous bull elephant named Jumbo, which Basu used to illustrate his objections to the Horvitz\u2013Thompson estimator and to Fisher's randomisation test.Basu taught at the Indian Statistical Institute and various universities around the world. He moved to the United States and taught statistics at Florida State University from 1975 to 1990 when he was made an emeritus professor; he has supervised six PhD students. In 1979 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association."

Intrigued by anthropology, he gave up plans for a technical career. In 1927 he received a degree from the \u00c9cole Nationale de Langues Orientales, where he concentrated on Amharic and Ge'ez.\nBetween 1928 and 1933 Griaule participated in two large-scale ethnographic expeditions\u2014one to Ethiopia and the ambitious Dakar to Djibouti expedition which crossed Africa. On the latter expedition he first visited the Dogon, the ethnic group with whom he would be forever associated.\nIn 1933 he received a diploma from the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes in religion.\nThroughout the 1930s Griaule and his student Germaine Dieterlen undertook several group expeditions to the Dogon area in Mali. During these trips Griaule pioneered the use of aerial photography, surveying, and teamwork to study other cultures. In 1938 he produced his dissertation and received a doctorate based on his Dogon research.\nWith the outbreak of World War II Griaule was drafted again in the French Air Force and after the war he served as the inaugural professor of the first chair of anthropology at the University of Paris - Sorbonne. He died in 1956 in Paris.\nGriaule is remembered for his work with the blind hunter Ogotemmeli and his elaborate exegeses of Dogon myth ( fr )\u2014(including the Nommo) and ritual. His study of Dogon masks remains one of the fundamental works on the topic. A number of anthropologists are highly critical of his work and argue that his claims about Sirius and his elaborate accounts of cosmic eggs and mystic vibrations do not accurately reflect Dogon belief.Griaule is the father of anthropologist Genevi\u00e8ve Calame-Griaule (See fr: Genevi\u00e8ve Calame-Griaule)."

After graduation in 1952 from Baylor School, a private high school in Chattanooga, Tennessee, James entered Auburn University, where he played football for head coach Ralph \"Shug\" Jordan. In 1955 James was named All-American as a halfback. He received a civil engineering degree in 1957.  During the 1956 season, he played professional football in Canada as a member of the Montreal Alouettes. He entered the US Army and served two years as a lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers.\nFrom 1958 to 1959, James worked as a heavy construction engineer with Burford-Toothaker Tractor Company in Montgomery, Alabama. He had married and started a family. In 1959, his second born, Gregory Fleming James, was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. Needing more money to pay medical bills, James left Montgomery in 1960 to take a job as construction superintendent with Laidlaw Contracting Company, a road-paving company in Mobile.\nIn 1961, James decided that he could earn a living from the manufacture of plastic-coated barbells.  In 1962, he founded Diversified Products Inc., a manufacturer of fitness equipment; it was known for the plastic-disc barbells filled with \"Orbatron,\" which DP patented. The company name was changed to \"Diversified Products Corporation\" after originally being called Health-Disc Inc. In addition to physical fitness equipment, the company manufactured ballasts and counterweights for farms, industry and trucking.  James founded DP in his basement and, over the next 15 years, the company ultimately grew to employ 1,500 people with plants in Opelika, AL; Los Angeles, and Toronto, with sales of about $1 billion annually.  James served as the CEO of DP until 1977, when it was bought by the Liggett Group.\nJames's son Gregory died of cystic fibrosis at the age of eight. In 1981 James established the Gregory Fleming James Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, named in his honor. James played an integral role in the establishment of the center.\nFrom 1972 to 1974, James served as president of the Alabama Citizens for Transportation, a statewide committee that developed a twenty-year highway program. This was subsequently adopted by the Alabama Legislature."

Claudius and Andrew of the Burgundian (c.1729), where he experimented with reviving the High Renaissance central planning of a Greek cross surmounted by a central dome,  and, facing Trajan's Forum, Santissimo Nome di Maria (1736\u201338), which is elliptical in plan, with radiating chapels. He also provided designs for the marble revetment and stuccoes added to the interior of  San Luigi dei Francesi (1759\u201364).D\u00e9rizet lectured at the Accademia di San Luca on his theory of proportional harmonies between music and architecture. These theories, akin to those common in the Renaissance but currently fallen into desuetude, failed to convince the architect Giacomo Quarenghi, who attended the lectures, according to his remarks in letters to the mathematician Alexander Barca in Padua. Quarenghi studied with D\u00e9rizet 'for about a year' just before the latter died of apoplexy.\nA close friend was the painter-collector Adrien Manglard (1695\u20131760), his compatriot at the Accademia.There is a caricature of D\u00e9rizet by Pier Leone Ghezzi."

His pictures are the reflection of control, power, and influenced by and over human beings. His minimalistic photographs in the trilogy Ronde de Nuit, Docile Bodies, and Politics of Bacteria, picture the void of the other. In 1974 he captured the anonymity and the relationships between inhabitation, settlement and anonymity in The New Industrial Parks near Irvine, California (1974).\nHis books and exhibitions, his \"topographic work\", such as The New Industrial Parks, Nevada, San Quentin Point, Candlestick Point, expose the crisis of technology and define both objectivity and the role of the artist in photographs. His work Candlestick Point is made of 84 photographs documenting a public space near Candlestick Park, ruined by natural detritus and human intervention.Baltz moved to Europe in the late 1980s and started to use large colored prints.He published several books of his work including Geschichten von Verlangen und Macht, with Slavica Perkovic (Scalo, 1986). Other photographic series, including Sites of Technology (1989\u201392), depict the clinical, pristine interiors of hi-tech industries and government research centres, principally in France and Japan. In 1995, the story Deaths in Newport was produced as a book and CD-ROM. Baltz also produced a number of video works.\nBaltz taught at various institutions, including Claremont Graduate School, California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), University of California, Riverside (UC Riverside), California State University, San Bernardino, and the IUAV University in Venice, Italy, where in 2006 he co-founded the Arsenale Institute for Politics of Representation."

        "content": "Campillo was of very obscure origin.\nFrom his own account of his youth, written to Antonio de Mier in 1726, we only know that he was born in \"a house equally poor and honest,\" that he studied Latin by his own wish, that he entered the service of Don Antonio Maldonado, prebendary of C\u00f3rdoba, who wished apparently to train him as a priest, and that he declined to take orders. He left the service of Maldonado in 1713, being then eighteen years of age. In 1715 he became \"page\" to Don Francisco de Ocio, superintendent general of customs, who doubtless employed him as a clerk.In 1717, he attracted the favorable notice of Jos\u00e9 Pati\u00f1o, the head of the newly organized navy, and was by him transferred to the naval department. Under the protection of Pati\u00f1o, who became prime minister in 1726, Campillo was constantly employed on naval administrative work both at home and in America. It was Patino's policy to build up a navy quietly at home and in America, without attracting too much attention abroad, and particularly in England. Campillo proved an industrious and honest subordinate. Part of his experience was to be present at a shipwreck in Central America in which he was credited with showing spirit and practical ability in saving the lives of the crew.In 1726 he was denounced to the Inquisition for the offence of reading forbidden books. The proceedings against him were not carried further, but the incident is an example of the vexatious tyranny exercised by the Holy Office, and the effect it must have had even in its decadence in damping all intellectual activity.Between 1733 and 1737 he was Intendent of the Spanish army sent to Italy during the War of Polish Succession. After his return he became Intendent General of Army of Aragon.\nIn 1741, when Spain was entangled in a land war in Italy and a naval war with England, Campillo was summoned by King Philip V of Spain to take the place of minister of Finance, Navy, War and Indies. He had to find the means of carrying on a policy out of all proportion to the resources of Spain, with an empty treasury. His short tenure of power was chiefly notable for his vigorous attempt to sweep away the system of farming the taxes, which left the state at the mercy of contractors and financiers. Campillo's predecessors were constantly compelled to apply to capitalists to provide funds to meet the demands of the king for his buildings and his foreign policy.A whole year's revenue was frequently forestalled. Campillo persuaded the king to allow him to establish a system of direct collection, by which waste and pilfering would be avoided. Some progress was made towards putting the national finances on a sound footing, though Campillo could not prevent the king from disposing, without his knowledge, of large sums of money needed for the public service. He died suddenly on April 11, 1743.Campillo was the author of a treatise on a New System of Government for America printed at Madrid 1789. He also left a manuscript treatise with the curious title, What is superfluous and is wanting in Spain, in order that it may be what it ought to be, and not what it is."

        "content": "Cunningham began his career as an assistant to astronomer Fred Whipple at Harvard University. In this capacity, he became a driving force in using automated calculating methods for computing celestial orbits.\nDuring World War II, Cunningham joined the Ballistics Research Laboratory (BRL) at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland, putting his expertise in number crunching toward the war effort. The computational needs of the BRL revolved around the compilation of artillery firing tables and bombing tables and employed a number of methods, human, analog, and digital; the backlog of computation jobs was so overwhelming that a satellite computation center was opened at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering in Philadelphia, and improved methods of automated computation were sought. Cunningham was present at the June 1943 meeting at which J. Presper Eckert, John Mauchly, and Lt. Herman Goldstine proposed the construction of the ENIAC; the program was agreed upon the same day. Initial plans for the machine called for it to have a precision of 5 decimal digits, but Cunningham's input compelled the inventors to design it with a precision of 10 decimal digits.\nFrom 1945 to 1946, Cunningham served on the BRL's Computations Committee at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland, a group established as part of the Ballistics Research Laboratory to prepare the ENIAC for utilization following its completion the Moore School; the other Computations Committee members were Haskell Curry, Derrick Henry Lehmer, and Franz Alt. His duties included supervision of the laboratory's shop of IBM punched card calculating equipment, which was busy calculating ballistics trajectories, and writing sample problem specifications for benchmarking the ENIAC.\nIn 1946, Cunningham followed Lehmer to Berkeley where the latter was a professor, joining the Department of Astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley (a department that had 10 members in 1964\u20131965), and at one point serving as the department's chair. With Lehmer, Cunningham planned the construction of the California Digital Computer (CALDIC).\nWorking with the Leuschner Observatory in the 1950s and 1960s, Cunningham performed and published calculations of the orbits of comets. In particular, he showed that Comet Pereyra and Comet Ikeya-Seki were sungrazers similar to comets seen in 1668, 1843, 1880, and 1882."

Brennan and Waits first met in 1978 when Waits made his acting debut in Paradise Alley while Brennan was a scriptwriter, and then again during production of the Francis Ford Coppola film One from the Heart. At the time, Brennan worked at the American Zoetrope studio as a script analyst, while Waits composed the score for One from the Heart. According to Waits, they met on New Year's Eve.Waits dedicated his 1980 song \"Jersey Girl\" to Brennan, and they were married later that year in the Always Forever Wedding Chapel. After they married, Brennan encouraged Waits to become his own producer.Brennan is generally regarded as the catalyst for Waits' shift towards more experimental sound beginning with the 1983 album Swordfishtrombones, which Waits produced on a dare from Brennan. Her first co-writing credit appears on Rain Dogs in 1985 for \"Hang Down Your Head\", and by 1992 she was his main producer and constant song-writing partner; her record collection introduced him to the music of Captain Beefheart. Her work includes co-writing and collaboration on the albums Franks Wild Years (1987), Alice (2002), and Blood Money (2002), as well as the musicals The Black Rider (1989) and Woyzeck (2000).Waits has described Brennan as \"a remarkable collaborator.... She's bold, inventive and fearless. That's who you wanna go in the woods with, right? Somebody who finishes your sentences for you.\" Waits has also said: \"She doesn't like the limelight, but she's an incandescent presence on all songs we work on together.\" In 2008, Waits described their collaboration as \"one person holds the nail and the other one swings the hammer\". In 2020, Brennan described Waits' songs as either \"grim reapers\" or \"grand weepers\".In 2023, Waits and Brennan oversaw reissues of remastered versions of Swordfishtrombones, Rain Dogs, Frank's Wild Years, Bone Machine, and The Black Rider. The remasters used original master tapes and were marketed as \"The Island Years\", because they were originally released on Island Records."

        "content": "North was born in Walham Green in London, England. His father Charles North was a draper who together with his wife Fanny kept a shop in the area. They had three children apart from John \u2013 Charles, Fanny and Alfred. Little is known of John's early schooling, although he claimed to have been an avid reader from the age of 6 years. He left school at the age of 12.\nDue to a downturn in business, John's father was forced to shut up shop and relocate the business to Worthing (on the Sussex coast). After the business failed again, John's parents decided to emigrate with the youngest son Alfred to Canada. It is thought that John (then 14) and his two siblings, Charles and Fanny, were looked after by various relatives including an uncle in Walham Green, and a great uncle who owned a farm near Kimpton in Hertfordshire.\nHe showed artistic ability at a young age and received some training at art school as well as instruction from a local artist called Hackman. At the age of 10 he completed his first watercolour, The Thames from Wandsworth, which was subsequently exhibited by the Royal Watercolour Society in 1919. A number of other watercolours and sketches were also completed in his teens.\nAt the age of 16, he was apprenticed to produce illustrations for the notable London-based wood engraver Josiah Whymper. There North became friends with Frederick Walker, Arthur Boyd Houghton and George John Pinwell, who would later become associated with the Idyllic school. He worked \u2013 using a brush and pencil \u2013 on black and white illustrations for various publications, gaining a reputation for the quality of his landscapes.In 1868 he moved to Somerset, renting a room at Halsway Manor near Crowcombe \u2013 his friend and fellow artist Frederick Walker also lived there. North's vivid watercolour of Halsway Manor, from 1865, is in the  British Museum, London.  In 1866 North's parents returned from Canada and he became the main provider for the whole family. North moved to the village of Woolston in 1869.\nThe period 1860\u201367 brought both artistic success as an illustrator and financial security. North was also developing his skill as a watercolourist, so much so that in 1867 he decided to pursue his painting full-time and abandon his illustration work. He made his debut at the Royal Academy in 1869 with four watercolours, including The Wood Gatherers (1869; Cleveland Museum of Art). In the subsequent years up to 1887, he divided his time painting between Somerset, a studio in London, and a house in Algeria. North exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery and the New Gallery and was a member of Arts Club. He was eventually accepted as a member of the Royal Watercolour Society (RWS) and an associate of the Royal Academy (ARA).\nIn 1884 North married the 21-year-old Selina Weetch at Bicknoller Church in Somerset, setting up home in Beggearn Huish House in Nettlecombe. They went on to have six children, including Roland Arthur Charles North. Selina died in 1898.\nNorth became friends with the essayist Richard Jefferies in 1883 until the latter's death in 1887. Subsequently, North was involved in setting up a fund for Jefferies' widow and family, and invited them to stay at his home in Somerset, even arranging for the education of Jefferies' son Harold.\nIn 1895, North started the O.W. Paper & Arts Co. featuring fine papers for art printing and watercolor.In personality and politics North was a liberal, publicly championing the cause of social justice for the agricultural labouring class. He opposed the enclosure of common lands, campaigned for decent rural sanitation and for social housing.\nNorth died at Stamborough, Somerset in 1924, and is buried in the New Cemetery at Nettlecombe."

        "content": "The term \"idyllist\" is more properly applied to North's earlier black and white landscapes, which were driven by the necessity to illustrate a particular literary narrative. His later watercolour work was certainly not idyllist in the nostalgic, \"chocolate-box art\" sense of the word, but attempted to evoke a sense of spiritual communion with nature. In this North owed a lot to his friend Richard Jefferies, and biographer Herbert Alexander noted that North had to be in the right state of mind before he would start a painting.In 1895, North helped to develop a new, kind of linen-based art paper that was extraordinarily durable and ideally suited to the demands of the watercolourist. He experimented with this paper for the rest of his life and was able to develop a very detailed painting style using ordinary watercolor paint and no gouache. He built up his forms by applying the paints in very small dots and touches of pure colour \u2013 a technique predating pointillism by a decade."

They had a son named Charles Godfrey Haggas Cutcliffe Hyne (1 December 1897 \u2013 21 November 1916), who was wounded in the Battle of the Somme and died from his wounds. They also had a daughter, Nancy Mildred Cutcliffe Hyne (1902\u20131999).\nCaptain Kettle first appeared as a side character in the novel Honour of Thieves (1895). His first appearance as a main character was in the short story 'Stealing a President' in vol 1, issue 6 of Pearson's Magazine (1896). This initial short story was followed in 1897 by a series of twelve short stories again in Pearson's Magazine that were later collected and published as Adventures of Captain Kettle. Over the next four years two more sets of twelve stories were published in Pearson's Magazine and subsequently collected as Further Adventures of Captain Kettle (\"A master of fortune\" in the US) and Captain Kettle K.C.B. respectively.\nThe character of Captain Kettle was one of action and decision. He is said to be based on a South Shields sea captain, Davey Proffit, whose physical appearance closely matched the descriptions in the books, but Cutcliffe Hyne insisted emphatically that this was not the case. However, the most enduring image of Kettle was created by Stanley L. Wood, who provided the illustrations for Pearson's Magazine; they were reprinted in the first book compilations of the stories. He found 'the exact spit and image of our little sailor, pulling beer behind a bar' in a pub in north London. This is noteworthy because Wood's Captain Kettle bears a striking resemblance (particularly in his stance, the set of the head on the shoulders, his beard and the characteristic gaze) to the novelist Joseph Conrad, also a sailor. Among the people who saw this remarkable similarity was H. G. Wells, whose War of the Worlds appeared in Pearson's in instalments, alternating with the Captain Kettle stories. Conrad met Wells at just this time, read Pearson's, and borrowed whole phrases, key episodes, and images from the Kettle stories for Heart of Darkness.\nCutcliffe Hyne would probably have been forgotten but for the American science fiction fans such as Sprague de Camp. They republished The Lost Continent without permission, possible because of the then American copyright law, which led to the republishing of his other stories."

His filmmaking was particularly influential, with critic Georges Sadoul considering him \"one of the three major postwar Greek directors\" (along with Michael Cacoyannis and Nikos Koundouros).Tzavellas wrote at least 26 plays, in addition to writing the scripts for all of his films. Among his notable films are  Marinos Kontaras (1948), the drama O methystakas (1950), and Antigone (1961), a cinematic adaptation of the Sophocles tragedy. His adaptation of Antigone reimagined it in the language of realist cinema, omitting stylized elements of Greek stageplay such as the chorus, and attempting to convey the same information via setting and dialogue. In 1964 he was a member of the jury at the 14th Berlin International Film Festival.  His masterpiece, however, is the 1955 film The Counterfeit Coin (I k\u00e1lpiki l\u00edra), a film in four parts, linking the stories of several people through their transactions of a single counterfeit gold coin."

In 1969, Vincent's band needed a piano player to secure bookings and Vincent ended up hiring Joe Pesci to play guitar. As the popularity of lounge music waned, Vincent and Pesci turned to stand-up comedy, performing as \"Vincent and Pesci\" from 1970 to 1976. Their act coupled Abbott and Costello-inspired double act antics with Don Rickles-style insult comedy, which proved popular.

De Niro told Martin Scorsese about both Vincent and Pesci.

He underwent open heart surgery in New Jersey on September 13; however, he died shortly thereafter, at the age of 80 years. Director John Gallagher, who worked with Vincent on Street Hunter and The Deli, noted that the actor lied about his age to avoid discrimination, and therefore many sources listed his birth year as 1939. He also omitted using his Italian last name to further avoid discrimination by Hollywood during his career. \nVincent's remains were cremated at a funeral home in Montclair, New Jersey, and a funeral service was held on September 16."

Between 1913 and 1920 William (Bill) worked as a reporter for a Reading, Pennsylvania newspaper.  He moved to Washington, D.C. in 1920 and started work for William Randolph Hearst's International News Service (INS).  As an INS reporter, he covered the John T. Scopes trial, also known as the  Scopes Trial, in Dayton, Tennessee and on July 24, 1925 he was the first reporter to file the dispatch stating the outcome.  A conversation that occurred during the last days of the trial, Scopes said:\n\"There's something I must tell you. It's worried me. I didn't violate the law ...I never taught that evolution lesson. I skipped it. I was doing something else the day I should have taught it, and I missed the whole lesson about Darwin and never did teach it. Those kids they put on the stand couldn't remember what I taught them three months ago. They were coached by the lawyers.\" \"Honest, I've been scared all through the trial that the kids might remember I missed the lesson. I was afraid they'd get on the stand and say I hadn't taught it and then the whole trial would go blooey. If that happened they would run me out of town on a rail.\"When Bill mentioned that would make a great news story, John responded, \"My god no! Not a word of it until the Supreme Court passes my appeal. My lawyers would kill me.\"  In L. Sprague de Camp's book, The Great Monkey Trial, de Camp goes on to say that Bill claimed he overheard Clarence Darrow coaching the students on what to say, however, even with coaching, only one of the students implied that Scopes taught evolution.Bill also covered the national political conventions and events in the Capitol.  In 1939 he was the Bureau Chief of the International News Service in Washington, D.C.  In late 1949, during a game of hearts, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Bill came up with the idea for a list of names, photographs, and descriptions of the ten worst criminals wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  On March 14, 1950, the list was compiled and distributed as the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives list.Following his transatlantic solo flight and return to the United States in 1927, Charles Lindbergh gave his flight jacket to Bill.  He wore this jacket on many outings and kept it until his death.  The jacket was then willed to his brother Herb.  By the time of Herb's death in 1986,  the jacket had so deteriorated that it was mistakenly thrown out by someone who did not realize its historic value.Bill was a member of the bar in the District of Columbia and wrote two books, Life and Works of William E. Borah and Ten Days that Changed the World, the latter being an account of the ten days between the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of Japan. For many years he was owner and the Vice President of the Washington Redskins football team.  A World War I veteran, Bill received numerous awards from the Air Force, Army, and Navy for patriotic service.Bill was the president of the Senate Press Gallery for over 20 years.  As a token of appreciation for Bill's aid in having the Congressional press galleries renovated, the standing committee of House and Senate correspondents today presented a silver punch bowl to William K. Hutchinson of International News Service. In the photo, taken at the Capitol on 25-FEB-1938, Hutchinson is shown receiving the bowl from Nathan Robertson (right) of King Features who is Chairman of the committee.He died the day after the announcement of the merger of the International News Service with the United Press to form United Press International.  On May 26, 1958 the funeral was held with Vice President Richard Nixon as one of the pallbearers.  Bill was awarded the lifetime District of Columbia license plate number \"53\" which upon his death in 1958, was willed to John Willard Marriott.\n\n\n== References =="

He had been trying for some time to secure a production deal, and he drew the interest of the Casablanca label with a disco track called \"Rock It,\" which became a hit locally.\nReleased nationally in late 1979, \"Rock It\" made it into the Top 20 on the Billboard Disco Charts. Casablanca asked Greenberg for a full album, so he gathered several session players, among them guitarists David Rivkin and Tom Riopelle; keyboardist Ivan Rafowitz; synth and vocoder programmer Roger Dumas (not to be confused with French actor Roger Dumas); and bassist Terry Grant. Most importantly, he recruited lead vocalist Cynthia Johnson, the 1976 Miss Black Minnesota, who had been performing with an early version of The Time.\nThe group's debut album, Mouth To Mouth, was released in November 1979. \"Funkytown\" was the first single, and it was an instant hit, climbing to No. 1 on May 31, 1980, and spending four weeks there. In the wake of that success, \"Rock It\" was re-released but it only made the Billboard Top 50. The six-song release Pucker Up followed, featuring a disco remake of the British pub rock group Ace's hit ballad \"How Long.\" It earned gold and platinum records in many countries. Lipps Inc.'s full-length Designer Music was a huge success in Mexico and in Central and South America, and it made Top 10 on the Billboard Disco chart. Designer Music also earned gold and platinum elsewhere, including Mexico and Hong Kong, but no subsequent song matched the success of \"Funkytown\" in the United States.\nCynthia Johnson was already decreasing her involvement with the group, with Melanie Rosales and Margie Cox picking up some of the slack and later becoming lead vocalists. Johnson left for good in 1983, after three albums. Lipps Inc. released one more album before breaking up in 1985. Greenberg became a web designer in 1992 and stayed in that field through 2007."

        "content": "Louis-Alexandre Berthier's position as both Chief of Staff and Minister of War proved overwhelming, and in 1807 Napoleon relocated the Ministry of War to Paris, naming Clarke to head it. Clarke quickly took control of the Ministry and began developing its authority, first by taking over the responsibilities of the Ministry of War Administration and then by encroaching upon other Ministries' administrative areas. His role in thwarting the British invasion of the Netherlands, the Walcheren Campaign in 1809, lead to the emperor creating him Duc de Feltre (\"Duke of Feltre\", extinct in 1852 but extended in 1864). Napoleon came to depend on his authority and he was instrumental in organizing the administration and building the Grande Arm\u00e9e in 1811\u20131812. As chief military organizer, he claimed authority over conscription, the production of all military items, funding, and even health services. This led both to conflict with other Ministers and to an expansion of his own authority.In 1812, when Claude Fran\u00e7ois de Malet attempted his coup in Paris, Clarke saw an opportunity to expand his authority yet further. Anne Jean Marie Ren\u00e9 Savary, the Minister of Police and Clarke's main rival by 1812, was arrested by Malet and Clarke moved in to provide military police powers. Napoleon, however, was alarmed by Clarke's assumption of power in his absence and upon his return to Paris in December 1812 reappointed Savary. Although he needed Clarke's centralized Ministry in 1813, he never fully trusted Clarke after the Malet affair, and in November 1813 appointed an equally strong administrator, Pierre Daru, as Minister of War Administration. Daru began building his own authority, and during 1814 the army suffered as both Clarke and Daru sparred over administrative responsibilities and authority. As the Allies approached Paris, Clarke found himself with the responsibility to defend the capital but with split authority; not only was he charged with producing manpower for Napoleon, a duty he shared with Daru, but he was also responsible for the population and civil defense. He found himself organizing hospitals and mobilizing the population. In the end, his efforts at defense were ineffectual and he was one of the generals pressing for Napoleon's abdication."

        "content": "Giovannino Guareschi was born into a middle-class family in Fontanelle di Roccabianca, Province of Parma, in 1908. He always joked about the fact that he, a big man, was baptized Giovannino, a name meaning \"little John\" or \"Johnny\".\nIn 1926, his family went bankrupt and he could not continue his studies at the University of Parma. After working at various minor jobs, he started to write for a local newspaper, the Gazzetta di Parma. In 1929 he became editor of the satirical magazine Corriere Emiliano, and from 1936 to 1943 he was the chief editor of a similar magazine called Bertoldo.In 1943 he was drafted into the army, which apparently helped him to avoid trouble with the Italian Fascist authorities. He ended up as an artillery officer.\nWhen Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in 1943, he was arrested as an Italian military internee and imprisoned with other Italian soldiers in camps in German-occupied Poland for almost two years, including at Stalag X-B near Sandbostel. He later wrote about this period in Diario Clandestino (My Secret Diary).\n\nAfter the war Guareschi returned to Italy and in 1945 founded a monarchist weekly satirical magazine, Candido. After Italy became a republic, he supported the Democrazia Cristiana party. He criticized and satirized the Communists in his magazine, famously drawing a Communist as a man with an extra nostril, and coining a slogan that became very popular: \"Inside the voting booth God can see you, Stalin can't.\" When the Communists were defeated in the 1948 Italian general election, Guareschi did not put his pen down but also criticized the Democrazia Cristiana party.\nIn 1950, Candido published a satirical cartoon by Carlo Manzoni poking fun at Luigi Einaudi, President of the Republic. The President is at the Quirinal Palace, surrounded by, instead of the presidential guard of honour (the corazzieri), giant bottles of Nebbiolo wine, which Einaudi actually produced on his land in Dogliani. Each bottle was labeled with the institutional logo. The cartoon was judged 'in Contempt of the President' by a court at the time. Guareschi, as the director of the magazine, was held responsible and sentenced.\nIn 1954 Guareschi was charged with libel after he published two facsimile wartime letters from resistance leader and former Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi requesting that the Allies bomb the outskirts of Rome in order to demoralize German collaborators. The legitimacy of the letters was never established by the court, but after a two-month trial it found in favour of De Gasperi.  Guareschi declined to appeal the verdict and spent 409 days in Parma's San Francesco jail, and another six months on probation at his home.His most famous comic creations are his short stories, begun in the late 1940s, about the rivalry between Don Camillo, a stalwart Italian priest, and the equally hot-headed Peppone, Communist mayor of a Po River Valley village in the \"Little World.\" These stories were dramatized on radio, television and in films, most notably in the series of films featuring Fernandel as Don Camillo.\nBy 1956 Guareschi's health had deteriorated and he began spending time in Switzerland for treatment. In 1957 he retired as editor of Candido but remained a contributor.\nHe died in Cervia in 1968 of a heart attack, at age 60."

Over the next quarter-century, he directed twenty more feature films, of which he is best known for five made between 1937 and 1944: Gueule d'amour (1937), L'\u00c9trange Monsieur Victor (1938), Remorques (1941), Lumi\u00e8re d'\u00e9t\u00e9 (1943), and Le ciel est \u00e0 vous (1944), all but the first starring Madeleine Renaud.\nGr\u00e9millon rejected what he referred to as \"mechanical naturalism\" in favor of \"the discovery of that subtlety which the human eye does not perceive directly but which must be shown by establishing the harmonies, the unknown relations, between objects and beings; it is a vivifying, inexhaustible source of images that strike our imaginations and enchant our hearts.\""

He left the wushu team later to recover from his injury and worked in a factory for the next decade or so. During that period of time, Yu spent his free time studying martial arts and interacting with other martial artists to improve his techniques until he had fully recovered.\nFor 14 years during the course of his martial arts career, Yu had been working on recreating the shuang shou jian (double-handed sword) movement, which was believed to be extinct since the Tang Dynasty. In the wee hours of the morning of 15 September 1975, during a thunderstorm, Yu saw how a praying mantis reacted in response to the heavy downpour and conceived the ideas for completing the design of the swordplay technique.

        "content": "Edward Gough Whitlam  (11 July 1916 \u2013 21 October 2014) was the 21st prime minister of Australia, serving from 1972 to 1975. He held office as the leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), of which he was the longest-serving. He was notable for being the head of a reformist and socially progressive administration that ended with his removal as prime minister after controversially being dismissed by the governor-general of Australia, Sir John Kerr, at the climax of the 1975 constitutional crisis. Whitlam is the only Australian prime minister to have been removed from office by the governor-general.\nWhitlam was an air navigator in the Royal Australian Air Force for four years during World War II, and worked as a barrister following the war. He was first elected to the Australian House of Representatives in 1952, becoming a member of parliament (MP) for the division of Werriwa. Whitlam became deputy leader of the Labor Party in 1960, and in 1967, after the retirement of Arthur Calwell, was elected leader of the party and became the Leader of the Opposition. After narrowly losing the 1969 federal election to John Gorton, Whitlam  led Labor to victory at the 1972 election, after 23 years of continuous Coalition government.\nIn its first term, the Whitlam government introduced numerous socially progressive and reformist policies and initiatives, including the termination of military conscription and the end of Australian involvement in the Vietnam War, institution of universal health care and free university education, and the implementation of legal aid programmes. With the opposition-controlled Australian Senate delaying passage of bills, Whitlam called a snap double dissolution election in May 1974 in which he won a slightly reduced majority in the House of Representatives, and picked up three Senate seats to hold equal Senate numbers to the opposition. The Whitlam government then instituted the first and only joint sitting enabled under section 57 of the Australian constitution as part of the double dissolution process. His government's second term was dominated by a declining economy suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and the 1970s global recession, as well as a political scandal known as the Loans affair, which led to the removal of two government ministers. The opposition continued to obstruct Whitlam's agenda in the Senate.\nIn late 1975, the opposition senators refused to allow a vote on the government's appropriation bills, returning them to the House of Representatives with a demand that the government go to an election, thus denying the government supply. Whitlam refused to agree to the request, arguing that his government, which held a clear majority in the House of Representatives, was being held to ransom by the Senate. The crisis ended in mid-November, when governor-general Sir John Kerr dismissed him from office and commissioned the opposition leader, Malcolm Fraser, as caretaker prime minister. Labor lost the subsequent election by a landslide. Whitlam stepped down as leader of the party after losing again at the 1977 election, and retired from parliament the following year. Upon the election of the Hawke government in 1983, he was appointed as Ambassador to UNESCO, a position he filled with distinction, and was elected a member of the UNESCO Executive Board. He remained active into his nineties. The propriety and circumstances of his dismissal and the legacy of his government have been frequently debated in the decades since he left office. Whitlam is often ranked in the upper-tier of Australian prime ministers by political experts and academics, with political journalist Paul Kelly writing in 1994 that \"there is no doubt that in three years his government was responsible for more reforms and innovations than any other government in Australian history\"."

        "content": "Edward Gough Whitlam was born on 11 July 1916 at the family home 'Ngara', 46 Rowland Street, Kew, a suburb of Melbourne, the elder of two children (his sister, Freda, was born four years after him), to Martha (n\u00e9e Maddocks) and Fred Whitlam. His father was a federal public servant who later was Commonwealth Crown Solicitor, and Whitlam senior's involvement in human rights issues was a powerful influence on his son. Since his maternal grandfather was also named Edward, from early childhood he was called by his middle name, Gough, which in turn had come from his paternal grandfather who had been named after the British soldier Field-Marshal Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough.In 1918, Fred Whitlam was promoted to deputy Crown solicitor and transferred to Sydney. The family lived first in the North Shore suburb of Mosman and then in Turramurra. At age six, Gough began his education at Chatswood Church of England Girls' School (early primary schooling at a girls' school was not unusual for small boys at the time). After a year there, he attended Mowbray House School and Knox Grammar School in the suburbs of Sydney.Fred Whitlam was promoted again in 1927, this time to Assistant Crown Solicitor. The position was located in the new national capital of Canberra, and the Whitlam family moved there. As of 2008, Whitlam was the only prime minister to have spent his formative years in Canberra. At the time, conditions remained primitive in what was dubbed \"the bush capital\" and \"the land of the blowflies\". Gough attended the government Telopea Park School. In 1932, Whitlam's father transferred him to Canberra Grammar School where, at the Speech Day ceremony that year, he was awarded a prize by the Governor-General, Sir Isaac Isaacs.\nWhitlam enrolled at St Paul's College at the University of Sydney at the age of 18. He earned his first wages by appearing, with several other \"Paulines\", in a cabaret scene in the film The Broken Melody \u2013 the students were chosen because St Paul's required formal wear at dinner, and they could therefore supply their own costumes. After receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree with second-class honours in classics, Whitlam remained at St Paul's to begin his law studies. He had originally contemplated an academic career, but his lacklustre marks made that unlikely. Dropping out of Greek classes, he professed himself unable to care for the \"dry as dust\" lectures of Enoch Powell."

        "content": "Soon after the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Whitlam enlisted in the Sydney University Regiment, part of the Militia. In late 1941, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and with a year remaining in his legal studies, he volunteered for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). In 1942, while awaiting entry into the service, Whitlam met and married Margaret Elaine Dovey, who had swum for Australia in the 1938 British Empire Games and was the daughter of barrister and future New South Wales Supreme Court judge Bill Dovey. He entered the RAAF on 20 June 1942.Whitlam trained as a navigator and bomb aimer, before serving with No. 13 Squadron RAAF, based mainly on the Gove Peninsula, Northern Territory, flying Lockheed Ventura bombers. He reached the rank of Flight Lieutenant. While in the service, he began his political activities, distributing literature for the Australian Labor Party during the 1943 federal election and urging the passage of the \"Fourteen Powers\" referendum of 1944, which would have expanded the powers of the federal government. Although the party was victorious, the referendum it advocated was defeated. In 1961, Whitlam said of the referendum defeat, \"My hopes were dashed by the outcome and from that moment I determined to do all I could do to modernise the Australian Constitution.\" While still in uniform, Whitlam joined the ALP in Sydney in 1945. He was discharged from the RAAF on 17 October 1945, and continued to use Air Force log books to record all the flights he took until 2007. Whitlam completed his studies after the war, obtained his Bachelor of Laws, and was admitted to the federal and New South Wales bars in 1947."

        "content": "In October 1975, the Opposition, led by Malcolm Fraser, determined to withhold supply by deferring consideration of appropriation bills. With Field on leave (his Senate appointment having been challenged), the Coalition had an effective majority of 30\u201329 in the Senate. The Coalition believed that if Whitlam could not deliver supply, and would not advise new elections, Kerr would have to dismiss him. Supply would run out on 30 November.The stakes were raised in the conflict on 10 October, when the High Court declared valid the Act granting the territories two senators each. In a half-Senate election, most successful candidates would not take their places until 1 July 1976, but the territories' senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats, would assume their seats immediately. This gave Labor an outside chance of controlling the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976.On 14 October, Labor minister Rex Connor, mastermind of the loans scheme, was forced to resign when Khemlani released documents showing that Connor had made misleading statements. The continuing scandal bolstered the Coalition in their stance that they would not concede supply. Whitlam on the other hand, convinced that he would win the battle, was glad of the distraction from the Loans Affair, and believed he would \"smash\" not only the Senate, but Fraser's leadership as well.Whitlam told the House of Representatives on 21 October,\n\nLet me place my government's position clearly on the record. I shall not advise the Governor-General to hold an election for the House of Representatives on behalf of the Senate. I shall tender no advice for an election of either House or both Houses until this constitutional issue is settled. This government, so long as it retains a majority in the House of Representatives, will continue the course endorsed by the Australian people last year.\nWhitlam and his ministers repeatedly claimed that the Opposition was damaging not only the constitution, but the economy as well. The Coalition senators remained united, though several became increasingly concerned about the tactic of blocking supply. As the crisis dragged into November, Whitlam attempted to make arrangements for public servants and suppliers to be able to cash cheques at banks. These transactions would be temporary loans which the government would repay once supply was restored. This plan to prolong government without supply was presented to Kerr unsigned on 6 November, under the title \"Draft Joint Opinion\" (ostensibly of solicitor-general Maurice Byers and attorney-general Kep Enderby). It proposed that public employees, including members of the armed forces and police, \"could assign arrears of pay by way of mortgage\". The government's refusal to formalise this and other \"advice\" was a factor justifying Kerr's resort to advice from elsewhere.Kerr was following the crisis closely. At a luncheon with Whitlam and several of his ministers on 30 October, Kerr suggested a compromise: if Fraser conceded supply, Whitlam would agree not to call the half-Senate election until May or June 1976, or alternatively would agree not to call the Senate into session until after 1 July. Whitlam rejected the idea, seeking to end the Senate's right to deny supply. On 3 November, after a meeting with Kerr, Fraser proposed that if the government agreed to hold a House of Representatives election at the same time as the half-Senate election, the Coalition would concede supply. Whitlam rejected this offer, stating that he had no intention of advising a House election for at least a year.With the crisis unresolved, Kerr decided to dismiss Whitlam as prime minister. Fearing that Whitlam would go to the Queen and potentially have him removed, the Governor-General gave Whitlam no prior hint. Against Whitlam's advice, he conferred with High Court Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, who agreed that he had the power to dismiss Whitlam.A meeting among the party leaders, including Whitlam and Fraser, to resolve the crisis on the morning of 11 November came to nothing. Kerr and Whitlam met at the Governor-General's office that afternoon at 1:00 pm. Unknown to Whitlam, Fraser was waiting in an ante-room; Whitlam later said he would not have set foot in the building if he had known Fraser was there. Whitlam, as he had told Kerr by phone earlier that day, came prepared to advise a half-Senate election, to be held on 13 December. Kerr instead told Whitlam he had terminated his commission as prime minister, and handed him a letter to that effect. After the conversation, Whitlam returned to the Prime Minister's residence, The Lodge, had lunch and conferred with his advisers. Immediately after his meeting with Whitlam, Kerr commissioned Fraser as caretaker Prime Minister, on the assurance he could obtain supply and would then advise Kerr to dissolve both houses for election.In the confusion, Whitlam and his advisers did not immediately tell any Senate members of the dismissal, with the result that when the Senate convened at 2:00 pm, the appropriation bills were rapidly passed, with the ALP senators assuming the Opposition had given in. The bills were soon sent to Kerr to receive Royal Assent. At 2:34 pm, ten minutes after supply had been secured, Fraser rose in the House and announced he was prime minister. Whitlam immediately moved a successful no confidence motion against Fraser in the House. The Speaker, Gordon Scholes, was instructed to advise Kerr to reinstate Whitlam.Kerr refused to receive Scholes, keeping him waiting for more than an hour. In that time Kerr rang Justice Anthony Mason to ask for advice. Mason told him the no confidence motion in the House was \"irrelevant\". Kerr then dissolved Parliament by proclamation: his Official Secretary, David Smith, came to Parliament House to proclaim the dissolution from the front steps. A large, angry crowd had gathered, and Smith was nearly drowned out by their noise. He concluded his task by taking the unilateral step of re-instating the traditional ending for a royal proclamation \"God save the Queen\", a practice the Whitlam government had abolished. Whitlam, who had been standing behind Smith, then addressed the crowd:\n\nWell may we say \"God save the Queen\", because nothing will save the Governor-General! The Proclamation which you have just heard read by the Governor-General's Official Secretary was countersigned Malcolm Fraser, who will undoubtedly go down in Australian history from Remembrance Day 1975 as Kerr's cur. They won't silence the outskirts of Parliament House, even if the inside has been silenced for a few weeks. ... Maintain your rage and enthusiasm for the campaign for the election now to be held and until polling day."

        "content": "As the ALP began the 1975 campaign, it seemed that its supporters would maintain their rage. Early rallies drew huge crowds, with attendees handing Whitlam money to pay election expenses. The crowds greatly exceeded those in any of Whitlam's earlier campaigns; in The Domain, Sydney, 30,000 people gathered for an ALP rally below a banner: \"Shame Fraser Shame\". Fraser's appearances drew protests, and a letter bomb sent to Kerr was defused by authorities. Instead of making a policy speech to keynote his campaign, Whitlam made a speech attacking his opponents and calling 11 November \"a day which will live in infamy\".Polls from the first week of campaigning showed a nine-point swing against Labor, which would have decimated Labor if repeated in an election. Whitlam's campaign team disbelieved the results at first, but additional polling returns clearly showed that the electorate had turned against Labor. The Coalition attacked Labor for economic conditions, and released television commercials with the title \"The Three Dark Years\" showing images from Whitlam government scandals. The ALP campaign concentrated on the issue of Whitlam's dismissal and did not address the economy until its final days. By that time Fraser was confident of victory and content to sit back, avoid specifics and make no mistakes. In the election, the Coalition won the largest majority government in Australian history, winning 91 seats to Labor's 36. Labor suffered a 6.5 per cent swing against it and its caucus was cut almost in half, suffering a 30-seat swing. Labor was left with five fewer seats than it had when Whitlam took the leadership. The Coalition also won a 37\u201325 majority in the Senate.\nWhitlam stayed on as Opposition leader, surviving a leadership challenge. In early 1976, an additional controversy broke when it was reported that Whitlam had been involved in ALP attempts to raise $500,000 during the election from the Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr government of Iraq. No money had actually been paid, and no charges were filed.\nThe Whitlams were visiting China at the time of the Tangshan earthquake in July 1976, though they were staying in Tianjin, 140 kilometres (90 mi) away from the epicentre. The Age printed a cartoon by Peter Nicholson showing the Whitlams huddled together in bed with Margaret Whitlam saying, \"Did the earth move for you too, dear?\" This cartoon prompted a page full of outraged letters from Labor partisans and a telegram from Gough Whitlam, safe in Tokyo, requesting the original of the cartoon.In early 1977 Whitlam faced a leadership challenge from Bill Hayden, the last treasurer in the Whitlam government, with  Whitlam remaining leader of the ALP by a two-vote margin. Fraser called an election for 10 December. Although Labor managed to pick up five seats, the Coalition still enjoyed a majority of 48. According to Freudenberg, \"The meaning and the message were unmistakable. It was the Australian people's rejection of Edward Gough Whitlam.\" Whitlam's son Tony, who had joined his father in the House of Representatives at the 1975 election, was defeated. Shortly after the election, Whitlam resigned as party leader and was succeeded by Hayden."

        "content": "Whitlam was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in June 1978, and resigned from Parliament on 31 July of the same year. He then held various academic positions. When Labor returned to power under Bob Hawke in 1983, Whitlam was appointed as Australia's ambassador to UNESCO, based in Paris. He served for three years in this post, defending UNESCO against allegations of corruption. At the end of his term as ambassador Whitlam was elected to the Executive Board of UNESCO for a three-year term, until 1989. In 1985, he was appointed to Australia's Constitutional Commission.Whitlam was appointed chairman of the National Gallery of Australia in 1987 after his son Nick, who was then managing director of the State Bank of New South Wales, turned down the position. He and Margaret Whitlam were part of the bid team that in 1993 persuaded the International Olympic Committee to give Sydney the right to host the 2000 Summer Olympics.Sir John Kerr died in 1991. He and Whitlam never reconciled; indeed, Whitlam always saw his dismissal from office as a \"constitutional coup d'\u00e9tat\". Whitlam and Fraser put aside their differences and became friends during the 1980s, though they never discussed the events of 1975. The two subsequently campaigned together in support of the 1999 Australian republic referendum. In March 2010, Fraser visited Whitlam at his Sydney office while on a book tour to promote his memoirs. Whitlam accepted an autographed copy of the book and presented Fraser with a copy of his 1979 book about the dismissal, The Truth of the Matter.During the 1990s Labor government, Whitlam used the Australian Greens as a \"decoy questioner\" in parliament. According to Dee Margetts, Whitlam \"didn't like what Keating and Hawke had done\" and regularly sent the Greens questions to ask the government about policies he disagreed with.\nWhitlam initially had a close relationship with Labor leader Mark Latham, who held his old seat of Werriwa. However, by 2005 he had called for Latham's resignation from parliament. Whitlam called his support of Latham to enter federal politics as one of his \"lingering regrets\".Whitlam supported fixed four-year terms for both houses of Parliament. In 2006, he accused the ALP of failing to press for this change. In April 2007, he and Margaret Whitlam were both made life members of the Australian Labor Party. This was the first time anyone had been made a life member of the party organisation at the national level.In 2007, Whitlam testified at an inquest into the death of Brian Peters, one of five Australia-based TV personnel killed in East Timor in October 1975. Whitlam indicated he had warned Peters' colleague, Greg Shackleton, who was also killed, that the Australian government could not protect them in East Timor and that they should not go there. He also said Shackleton was \"culpable\" if he had not passed on Whitlam's warning.Whitlam joined three other former prime ministers in February 2008 in returning to Parliament to witness the Federal Government apology to the Aboriginal Stolen Generations by the then prime minister Kevin Rudd. On 21 January 2009, Whitlam achieved a greater age (92 years, 195 days) than any other prime minister of Australia, surpassing the previous record holder Frank Forde. On the 60th anniversary of his marriage to Margaret Whitlam, he called it \"very satisfactory\" and claimed a record for \"matrimonial endurance\". In 2010, it was reported that Whitlam had moved into an aged care facility in Sydney's inner east in 2007. Despite this, he continued to go to his office three days a week. Margaret Whitlam remained in the couple's nearby apartment. In early 2012, she suffered a fall there, leading to her death in hospital at the age of 92 on 17 March of that year, a month short of the Whitlams' 70th wedding anniversary.Gough Whitlam died on the morning of 21 October 2014. His family announced that there would be a private cremation and a public memorial service. He was the longest-lived Australian Prime Minister, dying at the age of 98 years and 102 days. He predeceased his successor Malcolm Fraser (14 years his junior) by just under five months. His funeral was attended by seven Australian prime ministers."

The Welcome to Country was given by Auntie Millie Ingram and eulogies were delivered by Graham Freudenberg, Cate Blanchett, Noel Pearson, John Faulkner and Antony Whitlam. Pearson's contribution in particular was hailed as \"one of the best political speeches of our time\". Musical performances were delivered by William Barton (a didgeridoo improvisation), Paul Kelly and Kev Carmody (their land rights protest song From Little Things Big Things Grow), as well as the Sydney Philharmonia Choir and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Benjamin Northey. In accordance with Whitlam's wishes, the orchestra performed \"In Tears of Grief\" from Bach's St Matthew Passion, \"Va, pensiero\" from Verdi's Nabucco, \"Un Bal\" from Symphonie fantastique by Berlioz and, as the final piece, Jerusalem by Parry. Jerusalem was followed by a flypast of four RAAF F/A-18 Hornets in missing man formation. Those attending the memorial included the current and some former governors-general, the current and all living former prime ministers, and members of the family of Vincent Lingiari. The two-hour service, attended by 1,000 invited guests and 900 others, was screened to thousands outside the Hall, as well as in Cabramatta and Melbourne, and broadcast live by ABC television.\nIn honour of Whitlam, the Australian Electoral Commission created the Division of Whitlam in the House of Representatives in place of the Division of Throsby, with effect from the 2016 election. ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher announced that a future Canberra suburb will be named for Whitlam, and that his family would be consulted about other potential memorials. Gough Whitlam Park in Earlwood, New South Wales, is named after him.In January 2021, the Whitlams' purpose-built home from 1956 to 1978 at 32 Albert Street, Cabramatta, designed by architect Roy Higson Dell Appleton, came up for sale. It was eventually sold at for $1.15 million to a group of Labor supporters, including former NSW Premier Barrie Unsworth, with the intention of restoring the house for educational purposes as a museum.  The work is supported by a Commonwealth government national heritage grant of $1.3 million, and is to be managed by the Whitlam Institute of Western Sydney University. The house was as of November 2021 proposed to be listed as a local heritage item in the Fairfield Local Environmental Plan 2013 as part of a regular LEP review, which identified the house as being at least of state heritage significance. Following renovations and restoration works, the \"Whitlam Prime Ministerial Home\" was officially opened by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on 2 December 2022."

        "content": "Whitlam remains well remembered for the circumstances of his dismissal. It is a legacy he did little to efface; he wrote a 1979 book, The Truth of the Matter (the title is a play on that of Kerr's 1978 memoir, Matters for Judgment), and devoted part of his subsequent book, Abiding Interests, to the circumstances of his removal. According to journalist and author Paul Kelly, who penned two books on the crisis, Whitlam \"achieved a paradoxical triumph: the shadow of the dismissal has obscured the sins of his government\".More books have been written about Whitlam, including his own writings, than about any other Australian prime minister. According to Whitlam biographer Jenny Hocking, for a period of at least a decade, the Whitlam era was viewed almost entirely in negative terms, but that has changed. Still, she feels Australians take for granted programmes and policies initiated by the Whitlam government, such as recognition of China, legal aid, and Medicare. Ross McMullin, who wrote an official history of the ALP, notes that Whitlam remains greatly admired by many Labor supporters because of his efforts to reform Australian government, and his inspiring leadership. Some rankings have put Whitlam high on the list of Australia's better prime ministers. Economist and writer Ross Gittins evaluates opinions on the Whitlam government's responses to the economic challenges of the time:\n\nWhat Labor's True Believers don't want to accept is that the inexperience, impatience and indiscipline with which the Whitlam government changed Australia forever, and for the better, cost a lot of ordinary workers their jobs. Many would have spent months, even a year or more without employment.But what the Whitlam haters forget is that Labor had the misfortune to inherit government just as all the developed economies were about to cross a fault-line dividing the post-war Golden Age of automatic growth and full employment from today's world of always high unemployment and obsession with economic stabilisation.\nWallace Brown describes Whitlam in his book about his experiences covering Australian prime ministers as a journalist:\n\nWhitlam was the most paradoxical of all Prime Ministers in the last half of the 20th century. A man of superb intellect, knowledge, and literacy, he yet had little ability when it came to economics. ... Whitlam rivalled Menzies in his passion for the House of Representatives and ability to use it as his stage, and yet his parliamentary skills were rhetorical and not tactical. He could devise a strategy and then often botch the tactics in trying to implement that strategy. ... Above all he was a man of grand vision with serious blind spots.\nWhitlam's last words in the documentary film Gough Whitlam \u2013 In His Own Words (2002) were in response to a question about his status as an icon and elder statesman. He said:\n\nI hope this is not just because I was a martyr; the fact was, I was an achiever."

He wrote in both Galician and Castilian, and worked as a teacher in the areas of Amoroce and Maceda (Ourense). In the impoverished Galician village atmosphere, a love-affair with pedagogy began, which would be the great passion of his life.\nIn 1932 he was the director of a pedagogical magazine Escuela del Trabajo (School of Work), published by A.T.E.O. (Ourense Teachers Association), of which he was president. The magazine had a successful two-year run, with twenty-six published editions, and caused an authentic revolution within the education system, which was anchored in the old methods of the time. Nu\u00f1ez imposed on this system a distinctively technical and pedagogical character, rejecting the old methods of memorisation and excessive intellectualism completely. He introduced methods from the new school, based on the latest pedagogical doctrines, and worked tentatively, yet steadily towards their establishment. It was the beginning  of the introduction of new pedagogical techniques to schools in Ourense, and Nu\u00f1ez was the central figure in this change (Montessori, Kerschensteiner, Ovide Decroly, Dewey, Cousinet, etc.).\nHeadmaster at \u00abConcepci\u00f3n Arenal\u00bb school, in A Coru\u00f1a, he continued developing the new scholastic techniques, establishing \"new aims\" of the education and orienting the social work of the school towards those aims. But The Spanish Civil War truncated his humanitarian aspirations. From 1936 on he became dedicated to deprived education, first in Lugo, and later in Orense, where he founded, in 1949 the center for the study of \"Estudios Galicia\". The interest of this center was mainly the special attention dedicated to the formation of teachers who would soon take the new techniques of education to their classrooms.\nIn August 1959 he was reinstated, first as a teacher and soon after as school headmaster, holding his last position in A Estrada (Pontevedra). The primary school of Casardomato (Ourense) was named after him by city council agreement (1980)."

        "content": "Alfred Brauer was Richard's brother and seven years older. They were born to a Jewish family. Both were interested in science and mathematics, but Alfred was injured in combat in World War I. As a boy, Richard dreamt of becoming an inventor, and in February 1919 enrolled in Technische Hochschule Berlin-Charlottenburg. He soon transferred to University of Berlin. Except for the summer of 1920 when he studied at University of Freiburg, he studied in Berlin, being awarded his PhD on 16 March 1926. Issai Schur conducted a seminar and posed a problem in 1921 that Alfred and Richard worked on together, and published a result. The problem also was solved by Heinz Hopf at the same time. Richard wrote his thesis under Schur, providing an algebraic approach to irreducible, continuous, finite-dimensional representations of real orthogonal (rotation) groups.\nIlse Karger also studied mathematics at the University of Berlin; she and Brauer were married 17 September 1925. Their sons George Ulrich (born 1927) and Fred Gunther (born 1932) also became mathematicians. Brauer began his teaching career in K\u00f6nigsberg (now Kaliningrad) working as Konrad Knopp\u2019s assistant. Brauer expounded central division algebras over a perfect field while in K\u00f6nigsberg; the isomorphism classes of such algebras form the elements of the Brauer group he introduced.\nWhen the Nazi Party took over in 1933, the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars took action to help Brauer and other Jewish scientists. Brauer was offered an assistant professorship at University of Kentucky. Brauer accepted the offer, and by the end of 1933 he was in Lexington, Kentucky, teaching in English. Ilse followed the next year with George and Fred; brother Alfred made it to the United States in 1939, but their sister Alice was killed in the Holocaust.Hermann Weyl invited Brauer to assist him at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study in 1934. Brauer and Nathan Jacobson edited Weyl's lectures Structure and Representation of Continuous Groups. Through the influence of Emmy Noether, Brauer was invited to University of Toronto to take up a faculty position. With his graduate student Cecil J. Nesbitt he developed modular representation theory, published in 1937.  Robert Steinberg, Stephen Arthur Jennings, and Ralph Stanton were also Brauer\u2019s students in Toronto. Brauer also conducted international research with Tadasi Nakayama on representations of algebras. In 1941 University of Wisconsin hosted visiting professor Brauer. The following year he visited the Institute for Advanced Study and Bloomington, Indiana where Emil Artin was teaching.\nIn 1948, Brauer moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan where he and Robert M. Thrall contributed to the program in modern algebra at University of Michigan.\nIn 1952, Brauer joined the faculty of Harvard University and retired in 1971. His students included Donald John Lewis, Donald Passman, and I. Martin Isaacs. Brauer was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1954, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1955, and the American Philosophical Society in 1974. The Brauers frequently traveled to see their friends such as Reinhold Baer, Werner Wolfgang Rogosinski, and Carl Ludwig Siegel."

        "content": "Several theorems bear his name, including Brauer's induction theorem, which has applications in number theory as well as finite group theory, and its corollary Brauer's characterization of characters, which is central to the theory of group characters.\nThe Brauer\u2013Fowler theorem, published in 1956, later provided significant impetus towards the classification of finite simple groups, for it implied that there could only be finitely many finite simple groups for which the centralizer of an involution (element of order 2) had a specified structure.\nBrauer applied modular representation theory to obtain subtle information about group characters, particularly via his three main theorems. These methods were particularly useful in the classification of finite simple groups with low rank Sylow 2-subgroups. The Brauer\u2013Suzuki theorem showed that no finite simple group could have a generalized quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup, and the Alperin\u2013Brauer\u2013Gorenstein theorem classified finite groups with wreathed or quasidihedral Sylow 2-subgroups. The methods developed by Brauer were also instrumental in contributions by others to the classification program: for example, the Gorenstein\u2013Walter theorem, classifying finite groups with a dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup, and Glauberman's Z* theorem. The theory of a block with a cyclic defect group, first worked out by Brauer in the case when the principal block has defect group of order p, and later worked out in full generality by E. C. Dade, also had several applications to group theory, for example to finite groups of matrices over the complex numbers in small dimension. The Brauer tree is a combinatorial object associated to a block with cyclic defect group which encodes much information about the structure of the block.\nIn 1970, he was awarded the National Medal of Science."

        "content": "Eduard Study had written an article on hypercomplex numbers for Klein's encyclopedia in 1898. This article was expanded for the French language edition by Henri Cartan in 1908. By the 1930s there was evident need to update Study\u2019s article, and Brauer was commissioned to write on the topic for the project. As it turned out, when Brauer had his manuscript prepared in Toronto in 1936, though it was accepted for publication, politics and war intervened.  Nevertheless, Brauer kept his manuscript through the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, and in 1979 it was published by Okayama University in Japan. It also appeared posthumously as paper #22 in the first volume of his Collected Papers.  His title was \"Algebra der hyperkomplexen Zahlensysteme (Algebren)\". Unlike the articles by Study and Cartan, which were exploratory, Brauer\u2019s article reads as a modern abstract algebra text with its universal coverage. Consider his introduction:\n\nIn the beginning of the 19th century, the usual complex numbers and their introduction through computations with number-pairs or points in the plane, became a general tool of mathematicians. Naturally the question arose whether or not a similar \"hypercomplex\" number can be defined using points of n-dimensional space. As it turns out, such extension of the system of real numbers requires the concession of some of the usual axioms (Weierstrass 1863). The selection of rules of computation, which cannot be avoided in hypercomplex numbers, naturally allows some choice. Yet in any cases set out, the resulting number systems allow a unique theory with regard to their structural properties and their classification. Further, one desires that these theories stand in close connection with other areas of mathematics, wherewith the possibility of their applications is given.While still in K\u00f6nigsberg in 1929, Brauer published an article in Mathematische Zeitschrift \"\u00dcber Systeme hyperkomplexer Zahlen\"  which was primarily concerned with integral domains (Nullteilerfrei systeme) and the field theory which he used later in Toronto."

He was also the assistant director of the first two Star Trek episodes: \"The Cage\" and \"Where No Man Has Gone Before.\" During Star Trek: The Original Series, he served as Gene Roddenberry's right-hand man, who managed the show along with John D. F. Black, Herbert F. Solow, D.C. Fontana, and Gene L. Coon. Justman was reportedly the first to call Gene Roddenberry \"The Great Bird of the Galaxy,\" drawn from a throwaway line from the original series episode \"The Man Trap\".Justman served as associate producer of Star Trek during its first two seasons, and was promoted to co-producer at the start of the third before resigning, partly due to exhaustion, and partly due to his displeasure with the decline in quality of the series, as well as what he considered its poor treatment by Paramount, the new owner of the studio. Paramount radically reduced the production budget during its third season.Justman's motion picture credits as an assistant director included The Big Combo (1955), Kiss Me Deadly (1955), The Big Knife (1955), Attack (1956), and Mutiny on the Bounty (1962).\nJustman also appeared in front of the camera once as an actor, playing the \"Elder of Luminos\" in \"A Feasibility Study\", a 1964 episode of The Outer Limits. His name also became the name of a shuttlecraft in Star Trek: The Next Generation.\nAlong with Herbert F. Solow, Justman wrote the book Inside Star Trek: The Real Story, published by Pocket Books in 1996. According to Publishers Weekly, \"As told by Solow, Star Trek's co-producer  [sic], and Justman, the executive in charge of production  [sic], this is arguably the definitive history of the TV show...With plenty of behind-the-scenes material that will be of interest to Trek fans, this book puts a good deal of emphasis on the show's business side, elucidating production difficulties, cost overruns, and the seemingly constant debate with NBC over the show's future.\"  (Publishers Weekly inadvertently gave Solow's title to Justman and vice versa.)"

        "content": "On 27 August 2008, Hartmann was indicted by the Tribunal for disclosing, in her book, Paix et ch\u00e2timent, Les guerres secr\u00e8tes de la politique et de la justice internationales, confidential information pertaining to two decisions of the Tribunal approving blackouts and exclusions from critical historical war documents provided by Belgrade for the trial of the former Serbian President Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and showing Serbia's involvement in the Srebrenica massacre.Hartmann posited that the ICTY Appeals Chamber had used invalid legal reasoning to effectively censor evidence which might have implicated Serbia-Montenegro in the alleged commission of genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1990s Balkans wars. She specifically criticized the ICTY Appeals Chamber for improperly denying victims of mass atrocities the ability to access information critical to their ability to obtain reparations for crimes committed against them and their relatives. She argued that the war documents censored by the ICTY should have been made available during a separate trial at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in which Bosnia unsuccessfully tried to sue Serbia for genocide, because they could not prove a direct link between Belgrade and war crimes committed in Bosnia \u2013 most notably the massacre of up to 8,000 Bosniak men and boys around Srebrenica in 1995.The Tribunal decision to grant confidentiality for the key portions of Belgrade war documents acknowledged that disclosure would harm Serbia's \"vital national interests\" by failing to protect Serbia from having to pay damages to Bosnia in Bosnia's suit then-pending at the ICJ.The issue at trial was whether the information she disclosed \u2013 \"the existence and the purported effect\" of the two impugned confidential decisions of the ICTY Appeals Chamber's dated 20 September 2005 and 6 April 2006 \u2013 was confidential or whether only the key evidence Serbia sought to censor was protected by a Court order.On 14 September 2009, the ICTY found Hartmann guilty of contempt of court and was sentenced to pay a \u20ac7,000 (\u00a36,100) fine for disclosing information relating to the two confidential ICTY Court orders that deprive victims and public from access to documents on Serbia's involvement in planning and executing the Srebrenica genocide in 1995. While the Chamber found that \"some protected information disclosed by the Accused in her publications was indeed in the public domain\", it considered that she disclosed \"more information, notably the legal reasoning applied by the Appeals Chamber in reaching its dispositions, as well as the purported effects of both Appeals Chamber decisions\".She was convicted on these grounds of violating two appellate orders dated 20 September 2005 and 6 April 2006 issued in the Slobodan Milosevi\u0107 case before the ICTY.On 24 September 2009, Hartmann launched an appeal against the conviction. The London-based international NGO called Article 19, which is dedicated to the protection and promotion of freedom of speech submitted an amicus curiae brief, calling the ICTY Appeals Chamber to apply the international standards allegedly disregarded by the Trial Chamber.On 19 July 2011, the ICTY Appeals Chamber dismissed all the grounds of appeal advanced by Hartmann and confirmed the conviction, limiting it exclusively to the \"disclosure of the legal reasoning of the two impugned confidential decisions\". The imposition of the \u20ac7,000 fine was upheld.In March 2011, prior to the issuing of the appeal judgement against Hartmann, the impugned confidential decisions criticized by Hartmann were turned down. Most of the critical documents provided by Belgrade for the trial of Slobodan Milosevi\u0107 in relation to which confidentiality orders had initially been made were released by the ICTY and admitted as public evidence in the ICTY case against Mom\u010dilo Peri\u0161i\u0107, former Yugoslav Army chief of staff. The only information pertaining to the 2005 and 2006 confidentiality Court orders that still remains protected is therefore the Appeals Chamber's legal reasoning. However, no ban was ordered in the ICTY Appeal judgment in relation to the three impugned pages of her book or her articles.In reaction to Hartmann's conviction by the ICTY, several international NGOs have criticized the ICTY for hiding its \"legal reasoning\" while the publicity of criminal proceedings is a general principle of criminal and international law which aim is to guarantee the transparency and public control of judicial proceedings. Reporters Without Borders and Article 19 condemned a conviction contravening international case law relating to freedom of expression.Reporters Without Borders stated that \"it is the duty of the press to highlight how this internationally created system of justice works, to question its procedures and to stimulate public discussion\". \"Article 19 believes that such an insistence on keeping the logic and effect of the ICTY's jurisprudence secret is profoundly undemocratic and manifestly inappropriate for an international criminal court\", adding that \"[t]o impose such a penalty on a journalist for bringing transparency and accountability to the ICTY raises troubling questions about the Tribunal's democratic legitimacy\".The \u20ac7,000 fine was deposited by Hartmann into a French dedicated bank account along with an invitation to the ICTY to seek assistance to the French authorities in order to collect these funds for the purposes of paying the fine. The ICTY Appeals Chamber deemed the money not to have been paid and converted, on 16 November 2011, the \u20ac7,000 fine into a seven-day prison term. An arrest warrant for contempt of court was issued by the ICTY on the same day, ordering France to transfer immediately Hartmann to The Hague and the Netherlands to assist in taking her to the United Nations detention unit. The French government refused to extradite Hartmann and informed the ICTY of this refusal on 27 December 2011.In November 2011, Reporters Without Borders urged the French judiciary to determine the validity of the arrest warrant and to consider the merits of the case in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. \"The European Court of Human Rights has consistently emphasized the public interest in the reporting of legal issues. It would be illogical and dangerous if international justice was exempt.\"On 30 November 2011, Article 19 denounced the unlawfulness of the arrest warrant and \"calls on all states, particularly the French and Dutch authorities, to avoid complicity in this perversion of international justice and to resist carrying out the order\". Article 19 insisted that the human rights guarantees enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) should take priority over the ICTY and recalled that under the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, French authorities as well as the authorities of the 46 other member states to the European Convention are obliged to verify the legality of the ICTY orders which they are asked to execute.Hartmann began petitioning Frank La Rue, United Nations Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Opinion and Expression, and Dunja Mijatovi\u0107, the Representative for Freedom of the Media of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), on 30 November. As there is no appeal before an independent jurisdiction from a decision of the ICTY, Hartmann is seeking from the Special Rapporteurs a judgement that the ICTY decision against her violates international standards of protection of the right of freedom of expression and that upholding or executing the arrest warrant against her would constitute a further violation of this right. Reporters Without Borders called on both rapporteurs to remind international courts that they are subject to international norms, especially those concerning freedom of expression, noting that \"[b]eyond the Hartmann case itself, the decision to penalize criticism of an international tribunal is a dangerous precedent for all those working in the media.\"On 24 March 2016, Hartmann was arrested by UN guards as she gave an interview near the war crimes tribunal building. She was granted early release on 29 March 2016."

Future Cities; Livable Futures featured an interdisciplinary panel of speakers focused on topics such as sustainable urban development, increasing population, inadequate infrastructure, poor social services, escalating health problems, and challenges posed by climate change.  Both her and Zaretsky were interviewed on public radio about sustainable urban development and their notion of livable cities.  She was interviewed by public radio for her views on environmental racism.  Then again on CBS where she described Hurricane Harvey as more of a man-made disaster than a natural disaster.\nIn 2014 she founded Louder Than A Bomb Cincy. She worked with local organizations, University of Cincinnati affiliations, spoken-word poets, and Cincinnati public school district teachers to bring what is the largest youth poetry slam in the nation, to Cincinnati. According to an article in the News Record, \"LTAB was originally founded in Chicago in 2001 through nonprofit Young Chicago Authors as a festival for young spoken word artists of diverse cultural backgrounds to gather and engage in performances of their poetry.\" She has been interviewed on national public radio and television for her work directing the Louder Than A Bomb Cincy program.  Her interviews have included 2016 interview with NPR, a 2015 interview with WVXU Chanel 5, and an earlier 2015 NPR interview with Bill Reinhardt.\nIn addition to community outreach, Adrian Parr Zaretsky has spoken on and been interviewed for her views on climate change, environmental degradation, and sustainable development. In her capacity as a UNESCO water chair, she is a strong advocate for water justice. In a NPR interview for World Water Day she speaks of the ongoing struggle for clean, accessible, and affordable water the world over. Again on public radio she speaks of the connection between environmental racism and the struggles of Native American communities to survive the rising seas and the contamination of their water supplies. Later, in a television interview with the Newsmakers, she describes Hurricane Harvey as more of a man-made than a natural disaster.\nIn an interview for The New York Times with journalist Natasha Lennard, Adrian Parr Zaretsky discusses how environmental damage and climate change are not only forms violence but a crime against humanity. In his op-ed in The New York Times Brad Evans, the founder/director of the Histories of Violence Project expanded upon Parr's framework of climate violence explaining that environmental degradation is a crime against humanity.  Evans writes, she \"also posed the question of what a crime against humanity actually means in such a context. It turns out, there are many ways in which damage to the environment rises to that level. This type of violence presents profound existential questions about what it means to be human and the ontological crimes (i.e., a crime against the human as such) some of us wage against ourselves.\""

In his endorsement of the book, 350.org founder Bill McKibben writes \"As Adrian Parr [Zaretsky] suggests in a timely fashion, imagination may be the best weapon we have in the fight against environmental destruction, as useful as a new engine or a bigger windmill.\"  Ananya Roy, author of Poverty Capital: Microfinance and the Making of Development, describes her book, as \"one that not only provides a rigorous and critical analysis of emergent environmentalism but also charts how imaginations of a 'new earth' can be forged at the limits of liberal democracy.  In this sense, the book is as much about the political as it is about the environment.  It is a must-read for our times.\" Henry Giroux, author of America at War with Itself, noted that \"Birth Of A New Earth is one of those rare and brilliant books that critiques the ongoing destruction of the environment in a writing style that is lyrical compassionate and as accessible as it is informative. She masterfully weaves together a language of critique and possibility and in doing so makes a convincing case of environmental and economic justice on a global scale and offers a powerful argument for rethinking the meaning and practice of politics.\" The book explores how activists and popular movements are fighting the environmental crisis of climate change and the ongoing devastation of the earth.  The influence of the growing environment can be seen in how corporate mission statements, government policy, and national security agendas now focus much more on sustainability.  Parr maintains political scenarios for change often pursue either a revolutionary platform or a reformist agenda.  She argues these are false choices as she advocates for an emancipatory political imagination, maintaining that environmental politics engages the twofold problem of democratization and decolonization.\nParr, Adrian (212). The Wrath of Capital: Neoliberalism and Climate Change Politics. New York City, New York: Columbia University Press. ISBN 0231158289.\nThis monograph has been commended by a number of experts in the environmental profession.  Raj Patel, the author of the two books Stuffed and Starved and the Value of Nothing, said of her book, \"With this short, pointed, and very welcome text, [she] blends political theory and startling fact to refresh our understanding about the capitalist roots of environmental change.\"  Her work investigates the intersection of social and environmental justice issues, arguing that the neoliberalism framework is hurting climate change talks and policy. Adrian Parr Zaretsky concentrates on how those with the most economic power continue to have control over the environmental change discourse. Many scholars felt this work contributed greatly to the field.  In a positive review of this work, M. M. Gunter Jr., of Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., wrote she \"presents an engaging, hard-cutting critique of neoliberalism, arguing more transformative politics are needed to address climate change and sustainability problems worldwide but that a \u2018Trojan horse\u2019 of market mechanisms under the dominant neoliberal paradigm prevents viable alternatives from emerging.\"  In Global Environmental Politics, Rebecca Pearse, a research associate working on the Global Arenas of Knowledge at the University of Sydney, writes that the book gives scholars and activists, who are looking for an introduction of leftist critiques on environmental politics, will receive a good summary from her book.  Critical of this work, John Bellamy Foster, a sociology professor at the University of Oregon, writes in \"Contemporary Sociology,\" she \"confuses matters by providing seemingly conflicting definitions of \u2018neoliberalism,\u2019 which she describes as (1) \u2018a more virulent strain\u2019 of the liberalism inherited from Adam Smith,\u2019 (2) \u2018a cultural mode of production that in turn defines the political economy,\u2019 and (3) a particular \u2018agenda.'\"  He says Adrian Parr Zaretsky allows readers to use words such as \"capital,\" \"capitalism, and \"the law of value,\" interchangeably, when the three words have three, different meanings.  Ryder W. Miller, a freelance environmental and science reporter based in San Francisco, writes in the Electronic Green Journal (2013), that Parr focuses too much on drawbacks of the environmental movement and does not acknowledge all the achievements of the movement.\nParr, Adrian; Zaretsky, Michael, eds. (2011). New directions in sustainable design. London: Routledge. ISBN 978-0415780377.\nAlong with Michael Zaretsky, a University of Cincinnati professor, she edited this anthology on sustainable design and development initiatives, combining the viewpoints of practitioners and scholars.  The central idea is that sustainable design is not merely about material production but also about changing the way people live, their relationship to the world, and one another.  This text combines a number of essays from recognized experts in sustainability practices, in theory, and design to construction, on order to develop a comprehensive approach to thinking, designing, building, and living sustainably. According to WorldCat, the book is held in 228 libraries \nParr, Adrian (2009). Hijacking sustainability. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press. ISBN 978-0262517461.\n\u00b7 In this work, she argues that contemporary environmental activism, rather than helping redress environmental issues, is actually hurting these same issues.  She uses five examples of where the capitalists are hijacking sustainability: corporate image-greening, Hollywood activism, gated communities, the greening of the White House, and the incongruous efforts to achieve a \u2018sustainable\u2019 army. These examples are used to help explain how architecture, especially urban spaces, add to global inequality by contributing more distinct boundaries between areas with and without poverty.    This work received several positive reviews. Jean Hillier, a professor at RMIT University's School of Global, Urban & Social Studies in Australia, writes when reviewing \"Hijacking Sustainability,\" in the journal of \"Deleuze Studies,\" that \"Parr maps the physical as well as intellectual spaces that construct boundaries between \u2018normal/indecent, honest/criminal, and neighborly/threatening\u2019 (135).\"  Antonelli Monika, an associate professor at Minnesota State University, writes in, \"the Electric Green Journal,\" that her work \"is a needed addition to environmental literature field due to the fact that there is limited information available on the attack on and the greenwashing of sustainability\" (p. 209). Daniel Barber, an associate professor and associate chair at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Design, wrote in the \"American Book Review\" journal that \"Parr [Zaretsky]\u2019s (piece) is the most theoretically sophisticated of this recent wave of environmentalist critique, and she provides a valuable interpretation of sustainability through the frameworks of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri\" (p. 4).  In a critical review of this work, R. Moore, with the University of Toronto, argues that she failed to adequately define the core term \"sustainability.\" While a difficult task, greater clarity is required in order to avoid an argument that is \"at best vague and at worst incomprehensible\" (p. 284).  Failing to clarify the term \"sustainability culture,\" Moore contends that readers do not get a good description of the type of individuals and organizations who can further environmental progress without adding to the capitalistic machine.  Monika notes she would like to see Adrian Parr Zaretsky add solutions about way people can fix this problem of \"Hijacking Sustainability.\"According to WorldCat, the book is held in 420 libraries \nParr, Adrian (2008). Deleuze and memorial culture: desire, singular memory and the politics of trauma. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. ISBN 978-0748627547.This work combines critical theory, cultural studies, and media theory with empirical research to describe the political scope of collective remembrance of traumatic events, e.g., the event of 9/11, the Holocaust, and the Amish shooting in Pennsylvania. Parr argues that memorialization, e.g., monuments marking a tribute, is not a means of capturing a definitive, implicitly negative historical truth of events but is, instead, a form of cultural production of a collective memory, which offers means of positive therapeutic outcomes for a group of people.\nBuchanan, Ian; Parr, Adrian, eds. (2006). Deleuze and the contemporary world. Edinburgh: Edinburgh Univ. Press. ISBN 0748623426.\nCo-edited this anthology with Ian Buchanan, now the director of the Institute for Social Transformation Research based at the University of Wollongong, the goal of this book is to show how Deleuzian concepts can be seen in today's political concerns.  Contributors use Deleuzian theories when explaining a number of real-world issues, e.g., the Holocaust, immigration, and the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Adrian Parr Zaretsky and Buchanan here defend Deleuzian concepts from some of their largest critics, many of whom attack Deleuze concepts as too abstract or idealistic.

ISBN 0748618996.\nFirst published by Columbia University Press in 2005, the book was subsequently expanded and published 2010 by both Columbia University Press and Edinburgh University Press. In the 2010 edition, she makes a new connection between Deleuze's more recent work and architecture, cinema, psychoanalysis, biology, and geography.  An expanded bibliography is also included. The book includes more than 150 entries, with some focus on individuals who have impacted Deleuze's work such as Spinoza, Nietzsche, Kafka, Hume, Leibniz, and Bergson, while the majority of the entries focus on Deleuze's main oppositional concepts, e.g., molar/molecular, exteriority/interiority, and deterritorialization/reterritorialization. To help readers, many of the entries provided a list of \"\u2019connectives,\u2019\" which point readers toward other sections in the dictionary.

This work examines the connections between science, technology, philosophy, art, and design developing a concept of creative production. Looking at the da Vinci\u2019s sketchbooks and work, Parr analyzes his method of creative production, arguing that da Vinci takes and reworks what is real, through an imaginative process, allowing a new reality to emerge.  According to WorldCat, the book is held in 103 libraries Adrian Parr Zaretsky is a regular contributor to the LA Review of Books series on violence.  She has interviewed Serbian performance artist, Marina Abramovi\u0107, spoken word artist Malcolm London, and sound artist David Rothenberg.

In the post-Revolution French educational system, most boys received scholarships for education up to age 14, and this allowed him to be educated at the academy at Sens. He then went at the age of sixteen to study pharmacy in Paris. There he attended the lectures of Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Fourcroy and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin. He was allowed into Vauquelin's laboratory even though he was unable to pay the monthly fee of 20 francs, due to the requests of Vauquelin's sisters. But his progress was so rapid that in two or three years he was able to take his master's place at the lecture-table, and Fourcroy and Vauquelin were so satisfied with his performance that they procured for him a school appointment in 1797 as a teacher of chemistry, and in 1798 one as r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique."

He also succeeded Fourcroy as member of the academy. In 1821, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1825 he received the title of baron from Charles X, and in 1832 Louis Philippe made him a peer of France. From 1827 to 1830 he represented the d\u00e9partement of Yonne in the chamber of deputies, and as vice-president of the conseil superieur de l'instruction publique, he exercised a great influence on scientific education in France. He died in Paris on 21 June 1857. A statue was erected to his memory at Sens in 1861, and in 1865 the name of his native village was changed to La Loupti\u00e8re-Th\u00e9nard.Above all things Th\u00e9nard was a teacher; as he himself said, the professor, the assistants, the laboratory \u2014 everything must be sacrificed to the students. Like most great teachers he published a textbook, and his Trait\u00e9 de chimie \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire, th\u00e9orique et pratique (4 vols., Paris, 1813\u201316), which served as a standard for a quarter of a century, perhaps did even more for the advance of chemistry than his numerous original discoveries."

Ludwig's mother Caroline Agnes Vogel was seventeen when she married the thirty-four-year-old Gustav. Ludwig von Bertalanffy grew up as an only child educated at home by private tutors until he was ten and his parents divorced, both remarried outside the Catholic Church in civil ceremonies. When he arrived at his Gymnasium (a form of grammar school) he was already well habituated in learning by reading, and he continued to study on his own. His neighbour, the famous biologist Paul Kammerer, became a mentor and an example to the young Ludwig.The Bertalanffy family had roots in the 16th century nobility of Hungary which included several scholars and court officials. His grandfather Charles Joseph von Bertalanffy (1833\u20131912) had settled in Austria and was a state theatre director in Klagenfurt, Graz and Vienna, which were important sites in imperial Austria. Ludwig's father Gustav von Bertalanffy (1861\u20131919) was a prominent railway administrator. On his mother's side Ludwig's grandfather Joseph Vogel was an imperial counsellor and a wealthy Vienna publisher. \nIn 1918, Bertalanffy started his studies at the university level in philosophy and art history, first at the University of Innsbruck and then at the University of Vienna. Ultimately, Bertalanffy had to make a choice between studying philosophy of science and biology; he chose the latter because, according to him, one could always become a philosopher later, but not a biologist. In 1926 he finished his PhD thesis (Fechner und das Problem der Integration h\u00f6herer Ordnung, translated title: Fechner and the Problem of Higher-Order Integration) on the psychologist and philosopher Gustav Theodor Fechner. For the next six years he concentrated on a project of \"theoretical biology\" which focused on the philosophy of biology. He received his habilitation in 1934 in \"theoretical biology\".Bertalanffy was appointed Privatdozent at the University of Vienna in 1934. The post yielded little income, and Bertalanffy faced continuing financial difficulties. He applied for promotion to the status of associate professor, but funding from the Rockefeller Foundation enabled him to make a trip to Chicago in 1937 to work with Nicolas Rashevsky. He was also able to visit the Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts.Bertalanffy was still in the US when he heard of the Anschluss in March 1938. However, his attempts to remain in the US failed, and he returned to Vienna in October of that year. Within a month of his return, he joined the Nazi Party, which facilitated his promotion to professor at the University of Vienna in 1940. During the Second World War, he linked his \"organismic\" philosophy of biology to the dominant Nazi ideology, principally that of the F\u00fchrerprinzip.Following the defeat of Nazism, Bertalanffy found denazification problematic and left Vienna in 1948. He moved to the University of London (1948\u201349); the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (1949); the University of Ottawa (1950\u201354); the University of Southern California (1955\u201358); the Menninger Foundation (1958\u201360); the University of Alberta (1961\u201368); and the State University of New York at Buffalo (SUNY) (1969\u201372).\nIn 1972, he died from a heart attack."

Cerrone's passion for music was discouraged by his father, who tried to distract him from his obsession. By the end of the 1960s, he was fascinated by Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana and Blood, Sweat & Tears, among others. At the age of 17, he convinced Gilbert Trigano to hire rock bands for his holiday clubs: Club Med (Club Mediterran\u00e9e). Cerrone became the A&R scout for 40 Club Med vacation villages around the world."

In Florence, Italy, she studied silver repouss\u00e9 and metal enameling before deciding to study landscape architecture. She returned to the United States to attend Smith College, studying under Henry Atherton Frost and graduating around 1920 and trained as both architect and landscape architect at the Cambridge School of Domestic and Landscape Architecture for Women, graduating in 1919. Among her fellow students was Gertrude Sawyer, with whom she would later work on an estate that is now the Jefferson Patterson Park & Museum.

        "content": "She opened her own architectural firm in 1925 during the Country Place Area (1890-1940), becoming the first female licensed architect in Washington. The period she opened was a booming time for landscape architects with work from country estates with much planning and construction to create outbuildings and large gardens, commissioned by the new rich after World War I. The firm employed a secretary, an assistant, and two drafters and was located in an office in downtown Washington and worked in mostly Virginia, Washington, and Maryland. She designed more than 500 landscapes in her forty-year career, specializing in residential design but emphasized the integral relationship between buildings and their surroundings.Greely worked on the staff of House Beautiful and in 1932, wrote the series \"Why Should the Garden Have Design?\" The series detailed her design philosophy, about Beaux-Art, Arts and Crafts, harmony, regional styles, native plant material and craft details. She felt that planting should echo the character of the architecture and that the landscape should emphasize the dominant points of the house and accentuate the beauty of an architectural element. Greely's designs for small city gardens were enclosed spaces, scaled with the house which made connections with the indoor space. Country estates were designed through a set of \"rooms\" emphasizing the landscape's vastness to create a parklike experience. Her suburban designs frequently featured a step-down entrance on the sidewalk, and a smaller set of \"rooms\" for differing activities. When working with clients, she prioritized their desires first, followed by the house (if built), and lastly by the existing landscape. Clients included members of the Garden Club of America, prominent figures in Washington including Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Chester Bowles, Jefferson Patterson, and institutions.One of her largest project, Aberdeen Proving Grounds, came in 1934 for the Army. The project received $2 million from Congress and Greely designed roads, gradings and plantings to complement the new buildings and houses. In 1936, she became a fellow and the only woman on the advisory board of the American Society of Landscape Architects\u2019 advisory committee for the Colonial Williamsburg restoration project. In the 1940s and 1950s, she worked on military landscapes, schools, real estate developments, government housing, outdoor theaters, playgrounds, gardens, roads, country estates, expanding her work throughout the United States and Mexico.Greely retired in 1956 due to arthritis but continued to consult on projects until the early 1960s. She died on May 23, 1969 at her home in Georgetown."

A literary conference was taking place nearby, and the writers organized a petition that reversed the decision. Baranowski staged one final production in Poland \u2013 Kafka's The Trial at the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw \u2013 before leaving the country.Baranowski emigrated to West Berlin in 1980 and rose to prominence in the city's Freie Theater scene, co-founding the company and theatre school TransformTheater Berlin and the International Directing Seminar at the K\u00fcnstlerhaus Bethanien with Swiss filmmaker Bettina Wilhelm.Baranowski's stage adaptations of works by Joyce, Kafka and Dostoyevsky formed the core of TransformTheater Berlin's repertoire. In the early years, he mounted his productions in Berlin, but once the greater openness that followed the founding of Solidarity had been institutionalized, he renewed his work in Poland. Concurrently, he began working in regional theaters in Germany and internationally. His productions were presented at Berlin's Hebbel am Ufer, the Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon, the Mittelfest in Italy, the European Theatre Festival in Krak\u00f3w, and numerous other festivals and venues in Poland, Germany, Russia, Italy, Norway and the USA. In the mid-1990s, he moved to a house in Brwin\u00f3w, a suburb of Warsaw.\nBaranowski made his English language debut with George Tabori's Peepshow in Chicago in 1991, which won a Joseph Jefferson Award for Best Ensemble. He went on to direct a number of other productions in the US in New York, Las Vegas, and Knoxville, Tennessee. In May 2001, he made his UK directing debut with an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Idiot, produced by The Playground at the Riverside Studios in London.\nBaranowski's 2009 production of Loneliness on the Net, adapted from the novel by Janusz Leon Wi\u015bniewski, has remained in the repertoire of the 837-seat Main Stage of the Baltic House in Saint Petersburg, Russia through the 2017/18 season, almost a decade after its premiere."

        "content": "During the early 1780s, Cooper became a storekeeper in Burlington, New Jersey, located along the Delaware River. By the end of the decade, he was a successful land speculator and wealthy frontier developer in what is now Otsego County, New York. Soon after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, he acquired a tract of land several thousand acres in extent within the borders of New York state and lying along the head waters of the Susquehanna River at Otsego Lake. He founded the Village of Otsego at the foot of the lake in 1786, creating a traditional plan for the village inspired by that of Burlington. He moved his family there, arriving on November 10, 1790. The judge and other investors also founded De Kalb, New York, near the east end of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River, in 1803, platting approximately 64,000 acres and selling the parcels on. His brother James took care of the holdings, which were tied up in litigation for years, both before and after the death of Judge Cooper in 1809. The Cooper family holdings were all gone by 1817. In 1852 a village was named Cooper's Falls north of De Kalb. James stayed in the area, and his son William grew up in De Kalb and was a carpenter. The existing De Kalb Historical Society building was built by the judge's nephew, William, and some of his descendants may still live in the area.\nAfter 1791, when Otsego County was split off from Montgomery County, Cooper was appointed as a county judge. He was later elected to two terms in Congress, representing the Federalist Party in the 4th (March 4, 1795 \u2013 March 3, 1797) and the 6th United States Congresses (March 4, 1799 \u2013 March 3, 1801).\nIn 1796, Cooper determined to make his home permanently in the town he had founded, which by that time promised to become a thriving settlement. It attracted many land-hungry migrants from New England. He began the construction of a mansion, completed in 1799, which he named Otsego Hall. For many years it served as his manor house; it was by far the most spacious and stately private residence in central New York.\nIn the first decade of the 1800s, Cooperstown began to struggle financially and saw a significant increase in violent crime, with Cooper himself being caned in the streets in 1807.:\u200a319\u200aCooper family tradition has it that Judge Cooper was killed by a blow to the head sustained during an argument with a political opponent after a public meeting in Albany, New York on December 22, 1809. No evidence of this can be found, and the story appeared to arise in 1897. A great-grandson of the judge published this account, which historians consider implausible. They believe that Judge Cooper died of natural causes.\nCooper was buried at the Episcopal Christ Churchyard in Cooperstown. His son James Fenimore Cooper, a popular author of historical novels, was buried there many years later.\nA great-grandson, Paul F. Clark, became a Nebraska State Representative. A great-great-grandson, writer Paul Fenimore Cooper, is known for the children's adventure, Tal: His Marvelous Adventures with Noom-Zor-Noom (1929, reprint 1957 and 2001)."

Her mother, Lily Mary Battherham, was a mathematician who taught secondary school and her father was the literary critic and philosopher Kenneth Burke. Leacock was raised between the family's apartment in Greenwich Village, New York and their northern New Jersey 150-acre farm, living half of the year in each place. Living in a social circle that included artists, political radicals and intellectuals prompted into Leacock an ideal \"to be scornful of materialist consumerism; to value\u2014even revere\u2014nature; to hate deeply the injustices of exploitation and racial discrimination...and to be committed to the importance of doing what one could to bring about a socialist transformation of society\".Leacock attended New York public schools during her childhood until her teenage years, when she got a scholarship to the prestigious private high school Dalton School. Also on scholarship, she started undergraduate courses in anthropology at Radcliffe College in 1939. At Radcliffe, she was introduced by Carleton S. Coon to the neo-evolutionary thought of V. Gordon Childe and C. Daryll Forde. She also became involved in studying Lewis H. Morgan and Karl Marx and in radical student politics. There she also met filmmaker Richard Leacock, whom she married in 1941. After curfew violations, Radcliffe authorities asked her to leave and she transferred to Barnard College in 1942. She studied under Gladys Reichard, graduating from Barnard in 1944 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in anthropology."

It is during this time in Paris that she began researching the social changes in the fur trade amount the Montagnais-Naskapi people. In 1951 Leacock received a grant to conduct fieldwork in Labrador, Canada. During this time she brought her one-year-old son with her to Labrador. She used this fieldwork to challenge the idea that private property is universal.She worked at Bank Street College of Education as a senior research associate, from 1958 to 1965, and at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in the social sciences department, from 1963 to 1972. She struggled to get a full-time job during the 1950s due to her outspoken political views. She taught as an adjunct for decades before being appointed, in 1972, as a professor and chair of anthropology at City College (CCNY) and graduate faculty of City University of New York Graduate Center. Although highly qualified, Leacock credited her CCNY appointment to the rise of the women's movement and social pressure felt by City College to diversify its faculty. Her appointment coincided with the publication of her celebrated introduction to Friedrich Engels' The Origins of the Family, Private Property and the State. In that introduction, she cited contemporary research to further explicate Engels' theory that \"the historic defeat of the female sex\" and subjugation of women began with the stratification of society, the widespread practice of private property, and the emergence of a state.\nIt is not until 1971 that she does her next big fieldwork assignment in Zambia. During this time Zambia had not let many anthropologists into the country because of perceived colonist attitudes. This particular fieldwork aided Leacock in her research of the decolonization efforts in primary school education.One of Leacock's most fruitful contributions to the field of anthropology was her essay entitled \"Interpreting the Origins of Gender Inequality: Conceptual and Historical Problems\" (1983), in which she discussed gender inequalities. Leacock's theories mainly concentrated on the relationships between race, class, gender, sexuality, and religion. And she refuted biological determinism as it relates to race, gender, and class. Leacock's work could be reflected in five areas: women's status in egalitarian societies, race, and gender in schools, culture of poverty studies, women's work in development, and the studies of race, class, and gender in Samoa. Arguing the roles of women in the hierarchical society, she claimed that some features of women become exploitable under the patriarchy system. Leacock interpreted the structure of marriage as the structure of exchange and the division of labor. The exploitation of women's labor within the household is the same.\nLeacock's career involved four major regions: North America, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific. In these areas she studied various topics including the anthropology of education, women cross-culturally, foraging societies, etc.Leacock died of a stroke on April 2, 1987, in Hawaii."

Pierre's family would have liked for him to enter the military as well, but his health was not sufficiently good for him to pursue a military career.Fatou entered the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris in 1898 to study mathematics and graduated in 1901 when he was appointed an intern (stagiaire) in the Paris Observatory. Fatou was promoted to assistant astronomer in 1904 and to astronomer (astronome titulaire) in 1928. He worked in this observatory until his death.\nFatou was awarded the Becquerel prize in 1918; he was a knight of the Legion of Honour (1923). He was the president of the French mathematical society in 1927.He was in friendly relations with several contemporary French mathematicians, especially, Maurice Ren\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chet and Paul Montel.In the summer of 1929 Fatou went on holiday to Pornichet, a seaside town to the west of Nantes. He was staying in Le Brise-Lames Villa near the port and it was there at 8 p.m. on Friday 9 August that he died in his room. No cause of death was given on the death certificate but Audin argues that he died as a result of a stomach ulcer that burst. Fatou's nephew Robert Fatou wrote:\n\nHaving never thought it useful during his life to consult a doctor, my dear uncle died suddenly in a hotel room in Pornichet.\nFatou's funeral was held on 14 August in the church of Saint-Louis, and he was buried in the Carnel Cemetery in Lorient."

        "content": "Fatou's work had very large influence on the development of analysis in the 20th century.\nFatou's PhD thesis S\u00e9ries trigonom\u00e9triques et s\u00e9ries de Taylor (Fatou 1906) was the first application of the Lebesgue integral to concrete problems of analysis, mainly to the study of analytic and harmonic functions in the unit disc. In this work, Fatou studied for the first time the Poisson integral of an arbitrary measure on the unit circle. This work of Fatou is influenced by Henri Lebesgue who invented his integral in 1901.\nThe Fatou theorem, which says that a bounded analytic function in the unit disc has radial limits almost everywhere on the unit circle was published in 1906 (Fatou 1906). This theorem was at the origin of a large body of research in 20th-century mathematics under the name of bounded analytic functions. See also the Wikipedia article on functions of bounded type.\nA number of fundamental results on the analytic continuation of a Taylor series belong to Fatou.\nIn 1917\u20131920 Fatou created the area of mathematics which is called holomorphic dynamics (Fatou 1919, 1920, 1920b). It deals with a global study of iteration of analytic functions. He was the first to introduce and study the set which is called now the Julia set. (The complement of this set is sometimes called the Fatou set). Some of the basic results of holomorphic dynamics were also independently obtained\nby Gaston Julia and Samuel Lattes in 1918. Holomorphic dynamics has experienced a strong revival since 1982 because of the new discoveries of Dennis Sullivan, Adrien Douady, John Hubbard and others. In 1926, Fatou pioneered the study of dynamics of transcendental entire functions (Fatou 1926), a subject which is intensively developing at this time.\nAs a byproduct of his studies in holomorphic dynamics, Fatou discovered what are now called Fatou\u2013Bieberbach domains (Fatou 1922). These are proper subregions of the complex space of dimension n, which are biholomorphically equivalent to the whole space. (Such regions cannot exist for n=1.)\nFatou did important work in celestial mechanics. He was the first to prove rigorously a theorem (conjectured by Gauss) on the averaging of a perturbation produced by a periodic force of short period (Fatou 1928). This work was continued by  Leonid Mandelstam and Nikolay Bogolyubov and his students and developed into a large area of modern applied mathematics. Fatou's other research in celestial mechanics includes a study of the movement of a planet in a resisting medium.(Fatou 1923b)"
