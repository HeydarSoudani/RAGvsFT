It was the first Megadeth album to feature lead guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza. The songs \"Hangar 18\" and \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" were released as singles. A remixed and remastered version of the album featuring four bonus tracks was released in 2004. Since its release, Rust in Peace has often been named as one of the best thrash metal records of all time, by publications such as Decibel and Kerrang!, and listed in the reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 33rd Grammy Awards. At the 1991 Foundations Forum, the album received a Concrete Foundations Award for \"Top Radio Album\" and the single \"Hangar 18\" won \"Top Radio Cut\" award."

        "content": "In 1988, Megadeth appeared at the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park in the UK, alongside Iron Maiden, Kiss, Helloween, Guns N' Roses, and David Lee Roth. The band performed to an audience of more than 100,000 people  and was soon added to the \"Monsters of Rock\" European tour, but dropped out after the first show due to bassist David Ellefson's drug problems. Further issues within the band caused frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine to fire drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, and canceled their scheduled 1988 Australian tour. Nick Menza, previously Behler's drum tech, was hired as the band's new drummer. The search for a new guitarist was a drawn out process; Mustaine examined a number of guitarists for the job, including Dimebag Darrell of Pantera and Jeff Waters of Annihilator, and the former was initially offered the job before declining. Mustaine had asked original Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland to rejoin the band, with Poland tracking lead guitar parts on a few demos. According to Poland he was \"99 percent going to join\" the band but was talked out of it by his manager. According to Mustaine, one of the last guitarists he had heard about, Marty Friedman, had sent him a copy of Dragon's Kiss, on which Friedman played. Upon listening to the record, Mustaine had Friedman come in to audition and hired him. This would become the band's first stable line-up and, as recognized by fans, the 'classic' Megadeth lineup. The album title Rust in Peace was inspired by a bumper sticker that Mustaine saw on the back of a vehicle while driving home from Lake Elsinore, California. The sticker read: 'May all your nuclear weapons rust in peace'. Mustaine liked the concept and decided to use it as a title for Megadeth's upcoming album. Rust in Peace was recorded at Rumbo Recorders with producer Mike Clink, while the mixing was handled by Max Norman. Clink was brought in for his work on both Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction and UFO's Strangers in the Night. The producer's work dealt mostly with the bass, drums and Friedman's guitar. In a 2002 interview, Mustaine declared that they \"really didn\u2019t make the record with [Clink]\" as at the time he was focused on Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I and II \u2014 which were also being recorded at Rumbo \u2014 and stated most of the work in the album was done by himself, Norman, and engineer Micajah Ryan. The album artwork was created by artist Ed Repka, who previously had done the cover for Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? in 1986. It references \"Hangar 18\", and depicts band mascot Vic Rattlehead and world leaders of the era viewing an alien body. In addition to creating the album's cover, Repka also supplied artwork for the album's two singles."

        "content": "The album features multiple lyrical themes: religion, politics and warfare, as well as Mustaine's personal issues, such as his fight against drug and alcohol addiction, UFO conspiracy theories and even the Marvel Comics character Punisher. The opening song, \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" finds its thematic inspiration derived from the Northern Ireland conflict, in which the largely Catholic nationalist community were in conflict with the mainly Protestant loyalist community over the sovereignty of the six counties of Northern Ireland. Mustaine has said that at a show in Antrim, Northern Ireland, he discovered bootlegged Megadeth T-shirts were on sale. He was dissuaded from taking action to have them removed on the basis that they were part of fund raising activities for \"The Cause\", explained as something to bring equality to Catholics and Protestants in the region. Liking how \"The Cause\" sounded as was explained to him, Mustaine dedicated a performance of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" to it, causing the audience to riot. The band were forced to travel in a bulletproof bus after the show. This incident, along with Marvel's Punisher, inspired Mustaine to write the song. \"Rust in Peace... Polaris\", addresses the topic of nuclear warfare, with \"Polaris\" referring to the Cold War-era Lockheed UGM-27 Polaris intercontinental ballistic missile. Mustaine has revealed that the song, originally titled \"Child Saint\", was one of his earlier compositions, having been written before his tenure with Metallica (1982\u201383). Menza proposed the concept for \"Hangar 18\", a song about UFO conspiracies and Area 51. Musically, the song features twin guitar solos after the verse."

In 1994, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping one million copies in the United States. Rust in Peace, along with the rest of Megadeth's Capitol-released studio albums, was remixed and remastered in 2004. Upon release, the album received widespread critical acclaim. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune called it Megadeth's most accomplished album, praising its \"instrumental virtuosity, thoughtful lyricism and punkish rage\". Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone wrote that the album is demonstration of how far the \"nasty speed thrash\" concept can go without being \"formulaic and boring\". Reviewing the album for Entertainment Weekly, Jim Farber described the music as \"sheer velocity, combined with dexterity\" and Mustaine's lyrics as \"nihilistic whimsy\". Mike Stagno from Sputnikmusic agreed that the songwriting was \"top notch\" on the album, as well as the fast and technical musicianship. He also spoke highly of Friedman's and Mustaine's guitar performance, calling them \"one of the most potent duos in the scene\". Spin reviewer Tom Nordlie praised the album, deeming it a \"mature, complex, surprisingly consonant and sparely produced album\", and concluded that Rust in Peace \"never sleeps\". Music journalist Kim Cooper also noted the album's maturity and wrote that Rust in Peace \"transcended the hard rock genre and raised the bar to a whole new level\". Another positive reaction came from Rock Hard, whose writer Holger Stratmann stated that the record was \"pure Megadeth\", filled with \"razor sharp guitars\" and \"snotty vocals\"."

Heavy metal magazine Decibel labeled the album as a \"genre-defining work\", while Kerrang! wrote that the record \"set a new standard for heavy metal in the 90s\". IGN named Rust in Peace the fourth most influential heavy metal album of all time, commenting that the album \"displays Dave Mustaine's finest writing ever\". Additionally, Martin Popoff ranked it eleventh among the best heavy metal albums of all time. In a reader poll organized by MusicRadar in 2010, Rust in Peace was voted as the sixth best metal album ever. The MusicRadar staff explained that the record saw Megadeth moving \"into the big league\", while staying true to their intricate sound and lyricism. In a list compiled by Chad Bowar of About.com, Rust in Peace was placed as the best heavy metal album of the 1990s and named a \"thrash masterpiece\". The album was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 33rd Grammy Awards. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The tracks \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" and \"Hangar 18\" have become staples of Megadeth's live set, and are fan favorites. In 2010, the band announced a 22-show North American tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Rust in Peace. The band performed the entire album at every show. Dates in South and Central America were later added to the tour, due to positive response from fans. In 2010, Shout! Factory released a live recording filmed on the Hollywood Palladium stop of the tour, entitled Rust in Peace Live. It was released on September 7, 2010 in Blu-ray, CD and DVD formats, and debuted at number 161 on the Billboard 200 and number two on the Billboard DVD charts. Rust in Peace in its entirety was released as purchasable downloadable content in the rhythm game Rock Band, a part of their \"Rust in Peace Download Package\". It was released a little more than a year after the release of Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? on the game's download store. A cover version of \"Holy Wars\" by Steve Ouimette was featured in Rock Revolution. \"Holy Wars\" was also featured in Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, while \"Hangar 18\" was featured in Guitar Hero II and as downloadable content for Guitar Hero 5. Both songs have been described as amongst the most difficult songs in the series' history. \"Holy Wars\", \"Hangar 18\" and \"Tornado of Souls\" were also released as downloadable content for Rocksmith 2014 A sequel to \"Hangar 18\" titled \"Return to Hangar\" later featured on Megadeth's ninth studio album, The World Needs a Hero."

McClatchy High School together, and participated in the city's skateboarding scene. Carpenter was a fan of heavy metal; Moreno was interested in hardcore punk bands such as Bad Brains as well as post-punk and new wave bands such as Depeche Mode and The Cure. When Moreno learned that Carpenter was a guitarist, he set up a jam session with Cunningham, who played drums. The trio began playing regularly in Carpenter's garage around 1988. They recruited bassist Dominic Garcia some time after, and the band became a four-piece. When Cunningham left Deftones to join Phallucy, another band from Sacramento, Garcia switched instruments and became the band's drummer. Chi Cheng filled the void as bassist, and the band recorded a four-track demo soon afterwards. Regarding the recording, drummer Abe Cunningham said, \"At the time we did the first record\u00a0\u2013 which I really like and think is good\u00a0\u2013 you can tell the band was really young. We'd been playing most of those songs for quite a while, and we were just so happy to be making a record that we didn't really think a whole lot about making the songs better\". Frontman Chino Moreno felt that Adrenaline was recorded \"really fast\", and he performed all his vocals live with the band in the room using a hand-held Shure SM58 microphone."

        "content": "Adrenaline was praised for its new, innovative sound, with critics initially comparing it to a diverse range of acts such as Helmet, Nine Inch Nails, the Cure, Korn, Nirvana, and the Smashing Pumpkins. In 1995, Jon Wiederhorn of Pulse stated that \"Adrenaline pitches between gloom-saturated melodies and explosive riffs, lashing out like a sleep-deprived paranoiac awakened by noisy neighbors. The rhythms are crisp and crafty and the vocals resonate both fury and sensitivity in a way that's similar to, but far more blatantly metallic than Nirvana\". Critic Katherine Turman wrote in January 1996, \"If this is what heavy metal is evolving into, it's a damn good thing\". Giving the album 3 out of 4 stars in her 1996 review, Los Angeles Times critic Sandy Masuo praised the album's nuance and blend of musical extremes and various influences: \"On the outside, Sacramento's Deftones are all pummeling rhythms and high anxiety, but delving further into the music turns up some surprising nuances: traces of post-punk pop, tinges of rap, a pinch of industrial grit. Chino Moreno rants, sobs, croons and even works some Middle Eastern overtones into his vocals, while Stephen Carpenter's guitar shifts from coarse outbursts to crisp Helmet-ine precision. A bracing blend of extremes\". In his 1996 review, Tomas Pascual of Livewire magazine similarly noted the album's subtle yet diverse musical influences and the juxtaposition of loud and heavy with soft and melodic: \"There are many bands these days that lay claim to a diverse section of influences. But no one band is as subtly boisterous about their eclectic mix as are Deftones. [...] Deftones' course is piloted by vocalist and frontman Chino Moreno, who expresses his smooth, melodic lyrics emotionally one minute before giving way to abrasive, maddened screams the next. Backed by the serene and apocalyptic guitar of Stephen Carpenter, this Yin-Yang formula keeps Deftones' debut Adrenaline progressively contagious\"."

While he noted that \"there is a bit of sameness in Chino Moreno's whispered vocal melodies, which drags the record down a bit\", Gioffre ultimately states that \"[o]n later albums, the band's progressive tendencies become more developed, but the more straight-ahead material on Adrenaline does not disappoint. A promising debut.\" In the book The Rough Guide to Heavy Metal, author Essi Berelian wrote that the album \"still stands as one of the best examples of nu-metal\". Writing for MetalSucks in June 2009, Carlos Ramirez noted that the wide range of musical influences in both Adrenaline and Around the Fur helped to establish the band in the underground music scene prior to their larger commercial breakthrough with third album White Pony: \"[Deftones'] first two albums, Adrenaline (1995) and Around the Fur (1997), were both chock full of bombastic guitars, new wave kissed vocal lines, and post-hardcore informed arrangements and their wide-scoped sound helped the Sacramento, CA band find audiences in various facets of the underground music scene\". In critic Tim Karan's 20th anniversary assessment for Diffuser, he wrote: \"For those who were swept up in the burgeoning nu-metal movement, 'Adrenaline' was a landmark, life-changing release. But Deftones never really were a true nu-metal band -- this album is more like hardcore-influenced post-hardcore than 'Nookie' -- and it only scratched at the surface of the experimental metal Deftones would soon step into\"."

Funkadelic signed to Westbound in 1968. Around this time, the group's music evolved from soul and doo wop into a harder guitar-driven mix of psychedelic rock, soul and funk, much influenced by the popular musical (and political) movements of the time. Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, The MC5, and Vanilla Fudge were major inspirations. The band made their first live television performance on Say Brother on October 7, 1969. They played a jam with songs \"Into My Own Thing\", \"What Is Soul?\", \"(I Wanna) Testify\", \"I Was Made to Love Her\" (a Stevie Wonder cover), \"Friday Night, August 14th\" and \"Music for My Mother\". On the group's self-titled debut, the credits listed organist Mickey Atkins plus Clinton, Tiki Fulwood, Eddie Hazel, Billy \"Bass\" Nelson, and Tawl Ross. The recording also included the rest of the Parliaments singers (still uncredited because of contractual concerns), several uncredited session musicians then employed by Motown, as well as Ray Monette (of Rare Earth) and future P-Funk mainstay Bernie Worrell."

        "content": "In conjunction with the release of Funkadelic, Westbound Records circulated a promotional single called \"Focus on Funkadelic\" to radio stations. The single features six snippets of tracks from the LP. According to critic Robert Christgau, Funkadelics \"dark, slow, tuneless\" music was originally panned and \"scared the bejesus out of fans of upful blackness on both sides of America's widening racial divide\". Writing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Christgau jokingly referred to Clinton as \"someone from Carolina who encountered eternity on LSD and vowed to contain it in a groove.\" Years later, Christgau rated the album as \"a prequel to Sly and the Family Stone's depressive There's a Riot Goin' On\". Mojo later hailed Funkadelic as \"the best blues-influenced, warped acid rock you're likely to hear\", and The Mojo Collection (2007) called it the band's first album of \"spaced-out psychedelic funk\". AllMusic's Jason Birchmeier said the recordings are \"essentially conventional soul songs in the spirit of Motown or Stax -- steady rhythms, dense arrangements, choruses of vocals -- but with a loud, overdriven, fuzzy guitar lurking high in the mix\". He deemed the album \"a revealing and unique record that's certainly not short on significance, clearly marking the crossroads between '60s soul and '70s funk\". \"I'll Bet You\" was later covered by The Jackson 5 on their album ABC, and sampled by the Beastie Boys for their song \"Car Thief\". The 2005 CD reissue also contains their version of \"Can't Shake It Loose\", which was recorded two years prior by Diana Ross & The Supremes on their album Love Child. In more recent years, The Red Hot Chili Peppers have combined the main riff of \"Mommy, What's a Funkadelic?\" and certain parts of the lyrics from \"What Is Soul?\" in live shows, a version which appears as a B-Side on their 2002 single \"By the Way\"."

In contrast to the British folklore-inspired lyrical content found on Songs From the Wood, Heavy Horses adopts a more realist and earthly perspective of country living \u2014 the album and its title track are dedicated to the \"indigenous working ponies and horses of Great Britain\".

        "content": "Heavy Horses was the first album recorded by Jethro Tull at the newly constructed Maison Rouge studio in Fulham, London, a custom built recording studio which was funded and owned by Ian Anderson. Much of the album was recorded at night, as Anderson felt that daytime hours at the studio needed to be left open for potential business clients. Keyboardist Dee Palmer (then David Palmer) recalled her diary entries at the time of recording as saying that \"I'd start at 7pm and go home at 7am!\" Heavy Horses was the first album on which Anderson began to experience vocal issues, the beginning of an affliction which would become more serious in the 1980s and later develop into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Anderson's vocals sound more nasal and gruff on some of the album's tracks as a result, particularly on the title track. As with the band's previous album Songs From the Wood, other members of the band beyond just Anderson were involved in writing music for the album, with guitarist Martin Barre writing portions of the title track and \"No Lullaby\" and Palmer writing string arrangements for most of the album as well as the instrumental bridge of \"...And the Mouse Police Never Sleeps\". Darryl Way of Curved Air guests on the album, playing violin on the title track and \"Acres Wild\". Several songs were recorded but then abandoned or otherwise cut from the album during the recording sessions, including the B-side \"Beltane\", a completely finished song titled \"Everything in Our Lives\" and an early acoustic version of \"Jack-a-Lynn\", a song which would later be re-recorded during sessions for the band's 1982 album The Broadsword and the Beast. Many of the unreleased songs recorded during the album's sessions were later released on the 20 Years of Jethro Tull anniversary compilation in 1988 and the 40th anniversary \"New Shoes\" edition of the album in 2018. Upon remixing of the album for the 40th anniversary edition, it was discovered that the original masters of \"Moths\" and \"Rover\" were slightly sharp, likely as a result of a faulty tape machine. The remixed versions of the tracks included on the re-release of the album were slightly pitched down to correct this."

        "content": "While continuing the folk rock style of Songs From the Wood, Heavy Horses sees a tonal shift into more earthly and realist themes of country living, compared with the fantasy and mythology of the previous album. Anderson was again inspired by daily life at his recently purchased country estate in Buckinghamshire, saying that \"I was living in the same house in the same place, and getting a bit more involved in farming and other rural stuff... so the horse-hoeing husbandry of the original Jethro Tull era was in the back of my mind.\" Several of the album's songs were directly inspired by Anderson's personal life at the estate: \"...And the Mouse Police Never Sleeps\" was partially inspired by his cat Mistletoe, \"No Lullaby\" was written as an \"anti-lullaby\" for his son and \"Rover\" was partially inspired by his dog Lupus. Other songs on the album such as \"Weathercock\" and the title track paint a cold and practical picture of country living, with the latter track described by Anderson as \"a lament for the passing as working animals of those magnificent beasts, the heavy farm horses.\" Other track's lyrics were inspired by literature, such as \"One Brown Mouse\" inspired by the Robert Burns poem \"To a Mouse\" and \"Moths\" inspired by the John le Carr\u00e9 novel The Na\u00efve and Sentimental Lover. Anderson stated that the recording of the album came at a time when other artists were moving towards the new trends in music, and the band decided they did not want \"to appear as if we were trying to slip into the post-punk coattails that were worn by The Stranglers or The Police.\""

        "content": "Live at Leeds is the first live album by English rock band The Who. It was recorded at the University of Leeds Refectory on 14 February 1970, and is their only live album that was released while the group were still actively recording and performing with their best-known line-up of Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle and Keith Moon. The Who were looking for a way to follow up their 1969 album Tommy, and had recorded several shows on tours supporting that album, but didn't like the sound. Consequently, they booked the show at Leeds University, along with one at Hull City Hall the following day, specifically to record a live album. Six songs were taken from the Leeds show, and the cover was pressed to look like a bootleg recording. The sound was significantly different from Tommy and featured hard rock arrangements that were typical of the band's live shows. The album was released in 23 May 1970 by Decca and MCA in the United States by Track and Polydor in the United Kingdom. It has been reissued on several occasions and in several different formats. Since its release, Live at Leeds has been cited by several music critics as the best live rock recording of all time."

        "content": "By the end of the 1960s, particularly after releasing Tommy in May 1969, The Who had become cited by many as one of the best live rock acts in the world. According to biographer Chris Charlesworth, \"a sixth sense seemed to take over\", leading them to \"a kind of rock nirvana that most bands can only dream about\". The band were rehearsing and touring regularly, and Townshend had settled on using the Gibson SG Special as his main touring instrument; it allowed him to play faster than other guitars. He began using Hiwatt amplifiers that allowed him to get a variety of tones simply by adjusting the guitar's volume level. The group were concerned that Tommy had been promoted as \"high art\" by manager Kit Lambert and thought their stage show stood in equal importance to that album's rock-opera format. The group returned to England at the end of 1969 with a desire to release a live album from concerts recorded earlier in the US. However, Townshend balked at the prospect of listening to all the accumulated recordings to decide which would make the best album, and, according to Charlesworth, instructed sound engineer Bob Pridden to burn the tapes. Pridden has since stated that not all of the tapes must have been burnt as some did eventually surface and got used. Two shows were consequently scheduled, one at the University of Leeds and the other in Hull, for the express purpose of recording and releasing a live album. The Leeds concert was booked and arranged by Simon Brogan, who later became an assistant manager on tour with Jethro Tull. The shows were performed on 14 February 1970 at Leeds and on 15 February at Hull, but technical problems with the recordings from the Hull gig\u00a0\u2014 the bass guitar had not been recorded on some of the songs\u00a0\u2014 made it all the more necessary for the show from the 14th to be released as the album. Townshend subsequently mixed the live tapes, intending to release a double album, but ultimately chose to release just a single LP with six tracks. The full show opened with Entwistle's \"Heaven And Hell\" and included most of Tommy, but these were left off the album in place of earlier hits and more obscure material. According to David Hepworth, because there was no microphone pointed towards the audience, crowd noise was a \"distant presence, as distant as the traffic outside,\" making the recording \"a faithful account of what the band played and nothing more.\""

        "content": "The album opens with \"Young Man Blues\", an R&B tune that was a standard part of the Who's stage repertoire at the time. It was extended to include an instrumental jam with stop-start sections. \"Substitute\", a 1966 single for the band, was played similarly to the studio version. \"Summertime Blues\" was rearranged to include power chords, a key change, and Entwistle singing the authority figure lines (e.g.: \"Like to help you son, but you're too young to vote\") in a deep-bass voice. \"Shakin' All Over\" was arranged similar to the original, but the chorus line was slowed down for effect, and there was a jam session in the middle. Side two begins with a 15-minute rendition of \"My Generation\", which was greatly extended to include a medley of other songs and various improvisations. These include a brief extract of \"See Me, Feel Me\" and the ending of \"Sparks\" from Tommy, and part of \"Naked Eye\" that was recorded for the follow-up album Lifehouse (which was ultimately abandoned in favour of Who's Next). The album closes with \"Magic Bus\", which included Daltrey playing harmonica and an extended ending to the song."

It resembled that of a bootleg LP of the era, parodying the Rolling Stones' Live'r Than You'll Ever Be. It contains plain brown cardboard with \"The Who Live at Leeds\" printed on it in plain blue or red block letters as if stamped on with ink (on the original first English pressing of 300, this stamp is black). The original cover opened out, gatefold-style, and had a pocket on either side of the interior, with the record in a paper sleeve on one side and 12 facsimiles of various memorabilia on the other, including a photo of the band from the My Generation photoshoot in March 1965, handwritten lyrics to the \"Listening to You\" chorus from Tommy, the typewritten lyrics to \"My Generation\", with hand written notes, a receipt for smoke bombs, a rejection letter from EMI, and the early black \"Maximum R&B\" poster showing Pete Townshend wind-milling his Rickenbacker. The first pressing included a copy of the contract for The Who to play at the Woodstock Festival. The label was handwritten and included instructions to the engineers not to attempt to remove any crackling noise. This is probably a reference to the clicking and popping on the pre-remastered version (such as in \"Shakin' All Over\"). Modern digital remastering techniques allowed this to be removed, and also allowed some of the worst-affected tracks from the gig to be used; on CD releases, the label reads, \"Crackling noises have been corrected!\""

Jonathan Eisen of Circus magazine felt that it flowed better than Tommy and that not since that album had there been one \"quite so incredibly heavy, so inspired with the kind of kinetic energy that The Who have managed to harness here.\" Greil Marcus, writing in Rolling Stone, was less enthusiastic and said that, while Townshend's packaging for the album was \"a tour-de-force of the rock and roll imagination\", the music was dated and uneventful. He felt that Live at Leeds functioned simply as a document of \"the formal commercial end of the first great stage of [The Who's] great career.\" In Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau asserted that, although side one was valuable for the live covers and \"Substitute\", the \"uncool-at-any-length\" \"Magic Bus\" and \"My Generation\" were not an improvement over their \"raw\" album versions. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Bruce Eder felt that the album was seen as a model of excellence for live rock and roll during the 1970s; that it was The Who's best up to that point, and that there was \"certainly no better record of how this band was a volcano of violence on-stage, teetering on the edge of chaos but never blowing apart.\" In a review of its 1995 CD reissue, Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly asserted that it showed why The Who were important: \"Few bands ever moved a mountain of sound around with this much dexterity and power.\" Mojo magazine wrote that \"the future for rock as it became, in all its pomp and circumstance, began right here.\" Steven Hyden, writing for PopMatters, said that it was \"not only the best live rock 'n' roll album ever, but the best rock album period.\" Roy Carr of Classic Rock, reviewing the 2010 Super Deluxe Edition of the album, remarked how the new Live at Hull section \"is noticeably more tight, more focused and even more aggressive\" than the original recording, concluding that \"we now have the two greatest live rock albums...ever.\" Who biographer Dave Marsh has praised the album as \"so molten with energy at times it resembles the heavy metal of Deep Purple and the atomic blues of Led Zeppelin ..... absolutely non-stop hard rock\". Accolades Live at Leeds has been cited as the best live rock recording of all time by The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, the BBC, Q magazine, and Rolling Stone. In 2003, it was ranked number 170 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list.,  and dropping to number 327 in a 2020 revised list. A commemorative blue plaque has been placed at the campus venue at which it was recorded, the University of Leeds Refectory. On 17 June 2006, over 36 years after the original concert, The Who returned to perform at the Refectory, at a gig organised by Andy Kershaw. Kershaw stated the gig was \"among the most magnificent I have ever seen\". A Rolling Stone readers' poll in 2012 ranked it the best live album of all time. It was voted number 356 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums."

        "content": "The original LP was released on 23 May 1970 in stereophonic format. There is an 8-second segment near the beginning of \"Magic Bus\" (leading into the lyric I don't care how much I pay) where the music is played backwards. Townshend stated that he did this deliberately to mark a part he had edited due to several mistakes. The 1995 and 2001 CD mixes edit this section differently and do not have the backward portion. The backwards portion was retained on Greatest Hits Live. The album was reissued on CD in 1985 by MCA in the US, and in 1987 by Polydor in Germany. In February 1995, the album was reissued as a remixed CD which included more songs than the original vinyl edition, as well as song introductions and other banter that had been edited out of the original release. For the remix,  vocals from the Hull show from Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle were mixed in to address occasional flaws in the original tapes or performances. The additional songs were inserted before and in the middle of the original track list, but left \"My Generation\" and \"Magic Bus\" as the final two tracks. In September 2001, a Universal Deluxe Edition version was released. The Deluxe Edition includes more chat between the songs, and the entirety of the band's Tommy set as performed at Leeds. Again, new overdubs from the vocalists were employed at select points. During the concert, \"Summertime Blues\", \"Shakin' All Over\", \"My Generation\", and \"Magic Bus\" were played after the Tommy set. The Deluxe Edition puts the Tommy'' set onto the second disc, moving \"My Generation\" and \"Magic Bus\" out of order to the end of the first disc. Universal Music released a 40th Anniversary edition of the album in November 2010, containing the full Leeds show from 14 February 1970 and the band's complete performance from the University of Hull recorded the following evening, as well as a heavyweight vinyl reproduction of the original six-track album, memorabilia and a replica 7-inch single of \"Summertime Blues/Heaven and Hell\". This performance had previously been unavailable because of a problem with the recording of John Entwistle's bass guitar on the first six songs. To fix this problem his performance at the Leeds show was overdubbed over these tracks of the Hull performance using digital technology. In November 2014, the complete concert was released in set list order on iTunes and HDtracks, with restoration of much in-between song patter. In November 2016, Universal Music released the complete concert as a three-disc album on the Polydor label, half-speed mastered at Abbey Road Studios, with a six-panel gatefold sleeve with assorted pictures and liner notes by Chris Charlesworth."

So they just stayed in the slums rather than moving into luxury. Erna says the results show in the music's \"tougher\" sound; \"however, it has a very raw edge to it. It's not very polished,\" he says. \"But it still has a lot of good grooves, and it still has a lot of power.\" The band also kept in touch with its roots by working some older unreleased material. The album includes older songs that just missed being on the debut. \"Goin' Down\" is a track from the original Godsmack album that was dropped in favor of \"Whatever\" for the major-label release.

In addition, this album was an attempt by the band to show that they could write more than just heavy metal songs. However, many fans wanted a heavier follow up to the previous record, Borrowed Time and did not like the progressive direction. There were two singles to be released from this album, which were \"Makin' Music\" (that had an extended version and an interview with Andy Peebles, now available on the released version of the album) and \"Out of Phase\", which had \"The Kingmaker\" as its B-side. \"Out of Phase\" was also released as a B-side for a live version of \"Sucking My Love\". The song \"Knight of the Swords\" is about the god Arioch in Michael Moorcock's Elric stories. This album was only released on CD in Japan making it a highly collectible item. On 15 October 2007 it was released by Metal Mind Productions on CD format, with bonus tracks. However, this was limited to 2000 copies.

Pearl Jam wrote and recorded Vitalogy while touring behind its previous album Vs. (1993). The music on the record was more diverse than previous releases, and consisted of aggressive rock songs, ballads, and other stylistic elements, making it Pearl Jam's most experimental album to date. The album was first released on vinyl, followed by a release on CD and cassette two weeks later on December 6, 1994. The LP sold 34,000 copies in its first week of release, and until Jack White's 2014 album Lazaretto it held the record for most vinyl sales in one week since SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991. Upon its CD release, Vitalogy became the second-fastest selling album in history, behind only the band's previous release Vs., selling 877,000 copies in its first week and quickly going multi-platinum. The album has been certified five times platinum by the RIAA in the United States. It is Pearl Jam's last album to feature drummer Dave Abbruzzese, who left the band before recording was finished.

        "content": "For the band's third album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer Brendan O'Brien. The band wrote many of the songs during soundchecks on its Vs. Tour, and the majority of the album's tracks were recorded during breaks on the tour. The first session took place late in 1993 in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the band recorded \"Tremor Christ\" and \"Nothingman\". The rest of the material was written and recorded in 1994 in sessions in Seattle, Washington and Atlanta, Georgia, with the band finishing the album at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle after the tour's completion. \"Immortality\" was written in April 1994 when the band was on tour in Atlanta. Sources state that most of the album was completed by early 1994, but it was not released until November due to either a forced delay by Epic or the band's battle with ticket vendor Ticketmaster. Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by the time they were working on Vitalogy. Producer Brendan O'Brien said: \"Vitalogy was a little strained. I'm being polite\u2014there was some imploding going on.\" Bassist Jeff Ament said that \"communication was at an all-time low\". Drummer Dave Abbruzzese stated that the communication problems started once guitarist Stone Gossard stopped acting as the band's mediator. According to Gossard, Vitalogy was the first album for which lead vocalist Eddie Vedder made the final decisions. At the time, Gossard thought of quitting the band. Gossard said the band was having trouble collaborating, so most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. He added that \"80 percent of the songs were written 20 minutes before they were recorded.\" During the production of Vitalogy, lead guitarist Mike McCready went into rehabilitation to receive treatment for alcohol and cocaine abuse. Drums on \"Satan's Bed\" were performed by Abbruzzese's drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On the day it was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as \"Jimmy\". Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for Vitalogy, Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with other band members. Gossard said: \"It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason, his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled.\" Jack Irons, the original drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on \"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\". Gossard said: \"Jack entered the band right at the end of making Vitalogy. Jack's a breath of fresh air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He was just there to play drums and help out.\""

        "content": "In a 1995 interview, Guitar World writer Jeff Gilbert described Vitalogy as \"strange\" and \"very eclectic\". McCready agreed, saying: \"There is some weird stuff on there.\" McCready attributed the album's sound to the group recording it on tour. During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said: \"Vitalogy is the first one where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, 'This is so different. Is anyone going to like this?'...It had a more punk feel to it. Simple songs recorded really quickly.\" The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said: \"Vitalogy is not really a 'solo' album. I don't think the songs demanded solos; it was more of a rhythmic album.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that \"thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, Vitalogy stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album.\" He added that \"in between the straight rock numbers and the searching slow songs, Pearl Jam contribute their strangest music\u2014the mantrafunk of 'Aye Davanita', the sub-Tom Waits accordion romp of 'Bugs', and the chilling sonic collage 'Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me'.\" \"Bugs\" features Vedder playing an accordion that he found at a thrift shop, while \"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\" was created using looped recordings of real patients from a psychiatric hospital. Many of the songs on the album address the pressures of fame and dealing with the resulting loss of privacy. These include \"Not for You\", \"Pry, To\", \"Corduroy\", \"Bugs\", \"Satan's Bed\" and \"Immortality\". Vedder said: \"I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express.\" The lyrics of \"Not for You\" express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and \"how youth is being sold and exploited\", while Vedder said \"Corduroy\" is about \"one person's relationship with a million people.\" In \"Pry, To\" the phrase \"P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me\" is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of \"Immortality\" may be about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it is about \"the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train.\" The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of \"Immortality\" were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said, regarding \"Nothingman\", that \"if you love someone and they love you, don't fuck up...'cause you are left with less than nothing.\" \"Better Man\" is a song about an abusive relationship. Vedder wrote \"Better Man\" when he was in high school and performed it with his previous band, Bad Radio. Considered a \"blatantly great pop song\" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility."

        "content": "Vitalogy was released first on vinyl on November 22, 1994, two weeks before its CD and cassette release, and debuted at No. 55 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The LP sold 34,000 copies in its first week of release, and, until Jack White's Lazaretto in 2014, it held the record for most vinyl sales in one week on Soundscan. It was also the first album to chart on the Billboard 200 due to vinyl sales alone since the CD became the dominant format for album sales. When Vitalogy was released on CD and cassette on December 6, 1994, it went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling more than 877,000 copies in its first week. It was the second-fastest selling album in history, behind only the band's previous release Vs. Vitalogy has been certified five times platinum by the RIAA, and, as of July 2013, has sold 5.9 million\u00a0copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. In July 2013, Rolling Stone ranked Vitalogy second in a reader's poll of Pearl Jam's best albums. Rolling Stone staff writer Al Weisel gave Vitalogy a positive four out of five stars, describing the album as \"a wildly uneven and difficult record, sometimes maddening, sometimes ridiculous, often powerful.\" While Weisel praised several songs, saying that \" Vitalogy has a number of gripping songs that match the soaring anthems of Ten, the extended grooves of Vs. or the poetry of either record\", he somewhat criticized some of the more experimental songs as \"throwaways and strange experiments that don't always work\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised the album's diversity compared to the band's previous records, commenting that the band incorporated \"fast but brutal punk, fuzz-toned psychedelia and judicious folk-rock, all of it sounding more spontaneous than before.\" He felt the band continued to be \"unremittingly glum\", and described the majority of the songs as \"tortured first-person proclamations\", commenting that \"Vedder sounds more alone than ever.\" Time reviewer Christopher John Farley singled out \"Bugs\" as one of the album's \"share of stinkers\", but added \"that's one admirably experimental failure on a largely successful album.\" Despite writing negatively of the album's \"shapeless high-energy riff-rockers\", Newsday staff writer Ira Robbins lauded Vitalogys sound and called it a \"compelling triumph of surface over substance\". In a mixed review of the album, Mark Jenkins of The Washington Post perceived a lack of subject matter or lyrical substance as Vitalogys weakness. Q magazine gave the album four out of five stars, stating: \"It speaks volumes for Pearl Jam's continuing creative acumen that they can respond so confidently to a new punk scene that has sprung up.\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album an A\u2212 rating, writing that \"Three or four of these songs are faster and riffier than anything else in P. Jam's book, token experiments like \"Bugs\" are genuinely weird, and in an era of compulsory irony [Vedder's] sincerity is something like a relief\u2014a Kurtlike relief at that.\" David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+, saying that \"Vitalogy marks the first time it's possible to respect the band's music as much as its stance\", but \"despite its musical advances, Vitalogy leaves an odd, unsettling aftertaste. You walk away from it energized, but wondering what price Eddie Vedder, and Pearl Jam, will ultimately pay for it.\" Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis gave tha album three out of four stars and commended Pearl Jam for their earnest songwriting. However, DeRogatis also wrote that the album \"leaves you wishing that they'd just lighten up\". USA Todays Edna Gundersen gave Vitalogy three and a half out of four stars and stated that it \"delivers the band's most compelling, inventive and confident music to date\", while calling it \"the rebel yell of a band that is maturing without mellowing\". Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn gave Vitalogy four out of four stars and viewed its music as an improvement over Pearl Jam's previous work, writing: \"This isn't just the best Pearl Jam album but a better album than the band once even seemed capable of making\". AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars, saying: \"Pearl Jam are at their best when they're fighting, whether it's Ticketmaster, fame, or their own personal demons.\" According to The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004): \"By Vitalogy PJ hit their apex \u2026 the band's creative zenith, finding them doing a Led Zeppelin III on acoustic tracks like 'Corduroy' and turning in a Tom Waits-like weird attack on 'Bugs'\". Three singles were released from Vitalogy. The lead single, \"Spin the Black Circle\" (backed with B-side \"Tremor Christ\", also from the album), was the band's first to enter the Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 18. At the 1996 Grammy Awards, \"Spin the Black Circle\" won the band its first Grammy Award, receiving the award for Best Hard Rock Performance. Neither of the album's other commercially released singles, \"Not for You\" and \"Immortality\", charted on the Hot 100, but both placed on the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock charts. Album tracks \"Better Man\" and \"Corduroy\" also charted. \"Better Man\" was the most successful song from Vitalogy on the rock charts, spending a total of eight weeks at number one on the Mainstream Rock chart and reaching number two on the Modern Rock chart. At the 1996 Grammy Awards, Vitalogy received nominations for Album of the Year and Best Rock Album. In 2003, the album was ranked number 492 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.  The magazine listed the album at number 485 on its revised list in 2012, saying it showed the band's \"mastery of rock's past and future\". In May 2014, Loudwire placed Vitalogy at number ten on its \"10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1994\" list. In July 2014, Guitar World placed the album on its \"Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994\" list. In 2011, Pearl Jam released a remastered Vitalogy, along with Vs., in three formats: an Expanded Version, a three-CD Deluxe Edition, and a Limited Edition Collector's Boxed Set. The Expanded Version features three bonus tracks: the previously unreleased guitar/organ-only mix of \"Better Man\"; a previously unreleased alternate take of \"Corduroy\" from the Vitalogy sessions (recorded by Brendan O'Brien); and a previously unreleased demo version of \"Nothingman\", taken from the original DAT (recorded at John and Stu's in Seattle on October 14, 1993, featuring Richard Stuverud on drums). The three-CD Deluxe Edition features both the Legacy Versions of Vitalogy and Vs. with their bonus tracks and a copy of Live at the Orpheum Theater, Boston, April 12, 1994."

        "content": "The original title for the album was Life. The first single, \"Spin the Black Circle\", was released before the album was released, and on the back of the single it states: \"From the Epic album Life\". The title Vitalogy, which literally means \"the study of life\", came from an early 20th-century medical book that Vedder found at a garage sale. This book was also the inspiration for the album's cover art and liner notes. Ament stated: \"Ed brought in that book, and we said man that would make a great album cover.\" After explaining that, from Vs. onward, the band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records, he said: \"We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways.\" Packaging the album in this way cost an extra 50 cents per copy. When the band discovered that later versions of the medical book were still under copyright, they had to confer with their lawyers as they worked out which material they wanted to utilize in the final version of the artwork. The booklet contains outdated discussions of health and well-being, as well as other notes, dealing with life and death reflections, which seem to be more personal, like a message typed on the \"Immortality\" page that seems to be referring to the loss of a loved one (\"I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I just wanted to tell you the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me.\"). It also includes some poems or original sayings that do not belong to the songs' lyrics, but can be interpreted as commentary on the songs or, again, as a reflection on how life should or should not be lived. An example is the poem typed on the \"Aye Davanita\" page. The song's subtitle is listed as \"The song without words\", as it is an instrumental track, but the page also displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of \"intruder words\" is on the \"Not for You\" page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the Sisyphus myth (\"Call me Sisyphus love. Yeh, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Get pictures taken of me while moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock.\"). The lyrics to \"Whipping\" are written on a copy of a petition to Bill Clinton against \"pro-life\" killings of abortion doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for \"Corduroy\"."

        "title": "Vitalogy_Tour",
        "content": "Pearl Jam promoted the album with tours in Asia, Oceania, and the United States in 1995. The band was joined by new drummer Jack Irons. The short tour of the United States focused on the Midwest and the West Coast. The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its tour of the United States, refusing to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined it in refusing to play at Ticketmaster venues. The band chose to use alternate ticketing companies for the shows. The tour of the United States faced various troubles. Ament said the band and its crew had to \"[build] shows from the ground up, a venue everywhere we went\". In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert, Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering from the effects of food poisoning. He left the hospital to play the show, but he was not able to finish and ended up performing just seven out of 21 songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said: \"That whole [Golden Gate Park] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [Young] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs.\" Because of Vedder's health, the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were later reinstated, while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said: \"I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music.\" Ament later said: \"We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career.\""

According to Gossard, \"Hard to Imagine\" was cut from Vitalogy because it did not fit with the other songs the band was writing at the time. \"Out of My Mind\", which is featured as a B-side on the \"Not for You\" single, was premiered on the band's 1994 spring tour of the United States and was played twice. According to Vedder, the song was just a live improv."

Quasimodo was born with a hunchback and feared by the townspeople as a sort of monster, but he finds sanctuary in an unlikely love that is fulfilled only in death. The role of Quasimodo has been played by many actors in film and stage adaptations, including Lon Chaney Sr. (1923), Charles Laughton (1939) and Anthony Quinn (1956), as well as Tom Hulce in the 1996 Disney animated adaptation, and most recently Angelo Del Vecchio in the Notre Dame de Paris revival. In 2010, a British researcher found evidence suggesting there was a real-life hunchbacked stone carver who worked at Notre Dame during the same period Victor Hugo was writing the novel and they may have even known each other."

        "content": "The deformed Quasimodo is described as \"hideous\" and a \"creation of the devil\". He was born with a severe hunchback, and a giant wart that covers his left eye. He was born to a Romani tribe, but due to his monstrous appearance he was switched during infancy with a physically normal baby girl, Agnes. After being discovered, Quasimodo is exorcised by Agnes's mother (who believed that the Gypsies ate her child) and taken to Paris, where he is found abandoned in Notre Dame (on the foundlings' bed, where orphans and unwanted children are left to public charity) on Quasimodo Sunday, the First Sunday after Easter, by Claude Frollo, the Archdeacon of Notre Dame, who adopts the baby, names him after the day the baby was found, and brings him up to be the bell-ringer of the Cathedral. Due to the loud ringing of the bells, Quasimodo also becomes deaf causing Frollo to teach him sign language. Although he is hated for his deformity, it is revealed that he is kind at heart. Though Quasimodo commits acts of violence in the novel, these are only undertaken when he is instructed by others. Looked upon by the general populace of Paris as a monster, he believes that Frollo is the only one who cares for him, and frequently accompanies him when the Archdeacon walks out of Notre Dame. Frollo lusts after a beautiful Gypsy girl named Esmeralda, and enlists Quasimodo in trying to kidnap her. (She is later revealed to be Agnes, the baby Quasimodo was switched with.) Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00e2teaupers arrives to stop the kidnapping and captures Quasimodo, unaware that Quasimodo was merely following Frollo's orders. The deaf judge Florian Barbedienne sentences him to an hour of flogging and another hour of humiliation on the pillory. Phoebus ties Quasimodo up and has Pierre Torterue whip him in front of a jeering crowd. When Quasimodo calls to him for help, Frollo allows Quasimodo to be tortured as punishment for failing him.  When Quasimodo calls for water, a child throws a wet rag at him. Seeing his thirst, Esmeralda approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him and she captures his heart. Esmeralda is later entangled in an attempted murder \u2013 committed by Frollo, who had stabbed Phoebus in a jealous rage after spying on Esmeralda and Phoebus having a night of passion \u2013 and is sentenced to hang. As she is being forced to pray at the steps of Notre Dame just before being marched off to the gallows, Quasimodo, who has been watching the occasion from an upper balcony in Notre Dame, slides down with a rope, and rescues her by taking her up to the top of the cathedral, where he poignantly shouts \"Sanctuary!\" to the onlookers below. Esmeralda is terrified of Quasimodo at first, but gradually recognizes his kind heart and becomes his friend. He watches over her and protects her, and at one point saves her from Frollo when the mad priest sexually assaults her in her room. In one instance Esmeralda also sees Phoebus from the cathedral balcony and pleadingly convinces Quasimodo to go down and look for him, but Phoebus is repulsed by Quasimodo's ugliness and refuses to visit Notre Dame to see her. After an uneasy respite, a mob of Paris' Truands led by Clopin Trouillefou storms Notre Dame, and although Quasimodo tries to fend them off by throwing stones and bricks down onto the mob and even pours deadly molten lead, the mob continues attacking until Phoebus and his soldiers arrive to fight and drive off the assailants. Unbeknownst to Quasimodo, Frollo lures Esmeralda outside, where he has her arrested and hanged. When Quasimodo sees Frollo smiling cruelly at Esmeralda's execution, he turns on his master and throws him to his death from the balcony in rage. Quasimodo cries in despair, lamenting \"There is all that I ever loved!\" He then leaves Notre Dame, never to return, and heads for the Gibbet of Montfaucon beyond the city walls, passing by the Convent of the Filles-Dieu, a home for 200 reformed prostitutes, and the leper colony of Saint-Lazare. After reaching the Gibbet, he lies next to Esmeralda's corpse, where it had been unceremoniously thrown after the execution. He stays at Montfaucon, and eventually dies of starvation, clutching the body of the deceased Esmeralda. Years later, an excavation group exhumes both of their skeletons, which have become intertwined. When they try to separate them, Quasimodo's bones crumble to dust."

        "content": "In Disney's 1996 animated film adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Quasimodo is a very different character than in the novel. He was voiced by Tom Hulce and animated by James Baxter. Unlike in the novel, Quasimodo has two eyes, with his left one only partially covered. He is not deaf, and is capable of fluent speech. He has three anthropomorphic gargoyle friends named Victor, Hugo, and Laverne. In the beginning of the film, a gypsy mother tries to bring the hunchbacked infant into Notre Dame with her for sanctuary, but the bigoted Judge Claude Frollo chases and inadvertently kills her. Frollo attempts to drown the baby in a nearby well upon seeing his deformity, but the church's Archdeacon stops him and demands that he atone for his crime by raising the child as his son. Fearing God's wrath, Frollo reluctantly agrees, and adopts the child in the hope that he will be useful to him one day. Frollo cruelly names the child Quasimodo, which in the film is Latin for \"half-formed\". Over the years he raises Quasimodo with cruelty, forbidding him to leave the tower and teaching him that the world is a wicked, sinful place, and that the Parisian people will reject him due to his deformity. He also lies to Quasimodo about his mother, telling him she abandoned him as a baby and that anybody else would have drowned him had Frollo not stepped in and adopted him. Quasimodo nevertheless grows up to be a kind-hearted young man who yearns to join the outside world. Quasimodo sneaks out of the cathedral during the Festival of Fools, where he is crowned the \"King of Fools\". While there, he meets Esmeralda, with whom he falls in love. Two of Frollo's guards ruin the moment where they throw tomatoes at him and bind him to a wheel to torment him. Then everyone joins in. Frollo refuses to help as punishment for his disobedience. Esmeralda takes pity on him and frees him after Phoebus failed to get Frollo to intervene. After Esmeralda escapes, Frollo confronts Quasimodo who apologizes and returns to the bell tower. He later befriends her, and he helps her flee from Frollo's men in gratitude. Frollo eventually locates the Gypsies and Esmeralda's lover Captain Phoebus at the Court of Miracles. He sentences Esmeralda to death, and has Quasimodo chained up in the bell tower. Quasimodo breaks free, however, and rescues Esmeralda from execution. Phoebus breaks free from his cage and rallies the citizens of Paris against Frollo's tyranny. From the bell tower, Quasimodo and the gargoyles watch the citizens fighting Frollo's army. They pour molten lead onto the streets, preventing Frollo and his soldiers from breaking in. However, Frollo successfully manages to enter the cathedral. He tries to kill Quasimodo, who is mourning Esmeralda, believing her to be dead. The two struggle briefly until Quasimodo throws Frollo to the floor and denounces him, finally seeing him for what he is. Esmeralda awakens and Quasimodo rushes her to safety. He then fights the wrathful Frollo, who reveals the truth about his mother to him. Both fall from the balcony, but Phoebus catches Quasimodo and pulls him to safety, while Frollo falls to his death. Quasimodo is finally accepted into society by the citizens of Paris as they celebrate Frollo's death and the liberation of the city."

He finds love in a beautiful circus performer named Madellaine (voiced by Jennifer Love Hewitt), who ultimately reveals that she is aware that the gargoyles are alive. His love for Madellaine is briefly strained when he learns she was actually working on behalf of a greedy magician named Sarousch who plans to steal a particularly valuable bell called La Fidele, from Notre Dame. Madellaine's true feelings for Quasimodo overcome her reluctant loyalty to Sarousch, however, and she aids Quasimodo in bringing Sarousch to justice.

At one point, Jiminy Cricket, when giving advice to the guests, consoles him by saying that some people find someone special and some people do not, poking fun at the fact that Quasimodo and Esmeralda did not fall in love at the end of the original film. Quasimodo is a very rare meetable character at the Disney Parks and Resorts, but can be seen as a figure inside Clopin\u2019s Music Box in Fantasyland. A German musical stage show Der Gl\u00f6ckner von Notre Dame (1999) derived from the Disney movie, restores some of the darker elements of the original novel lost in the film: Esmeralda dies from smoke inhalation at the end, Frollo is revealed to have once been a priest in his past (akin to the novel, where he was an archdeacon), and Frollo dies because Quasimodo throws him from the roof rather than falling by accident. Quasimodo appears in Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance voiced by Ari Rubin. He appears as a supporting character in a world based on the film called \"La Cit\u00e9 des Cloches\" and plays out a more or less the same role as in the film. In 2014 at the La Jolla Playhouse, Disney premiered a new adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Like the 1999 German Adaptation, the new adaptation was based on movie but it restored some of the themes, characters, and ending of Hugo's original book. It later transferred to PaperMill Playhouse in 2015, but was denied to transfer to a theater on Broadway. The musical also establishes Quasimodo as Frollo's nephew - Jehan runs off with a gypsy, Florika, after being expelled from Notre Dame's sanctuary. Years later, Frollo receives a letter from him and finds him on his deathbed. It is revealed Florika had died from pox and Jehan eventually dies from it as well, entrusting his brother with his son even though he is an established gypsy child."

The lunchbox itself is an homage to the Muppets' parody of Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard's \"The Swing,\" which was first featured in The Miss Piggy Calendar 1980."

The evidence is contained in the memoirs of Henry Sibson, a 19th-century British sculptor who worked at Notre Dame at around the same time Hugo wrote the novel. Sibson describes a humpbacked stonemason working there: \"He was the carver under the Government sculptor whose name I forget as I had no intercourse with him, all that I know is that he was humpbacked and he did not like to mix with carvers.\" Because Victor Hugo had close links with the restoration of the cathedral, it is likely that he was aware of the unnamed \"humpbacked carver\" nicknamed \"Le Bossu\" (French for \"The Hunchback\"), who oversaw \"Monsieur Trajin\". Adrian Glew also uncovered that both the hunchback and Hugo were living in the same town of Saint Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s in 1833, and in early drafts of Les Mis\u00e9rables'', Hugo named the main character \"Jean Trajin\" (the same name as the unnamed hunchbacked carver's employee), but later changed it to \"Jean Valjean\"."

The protagonist of \"Baba\" goes on a spiritual pilgrimage to India where she encounters a guru who, like many spiritual teachers in India, is referred to as \"Baba\". The word \"Baba\" means \"father\" in the Hindi language. Morissette opened most of shows during the Junkie era with the song, and it was featured as an opener during her 2002 tours. It has been seldom played since then. \"Baba\" opened Morissette's performance on the television show MTV Unplugged in 1999, but it was excluded from the CD release Alanis Unplugged. Another live version of \"Baba\" was released on the No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees CD. In a 2012 interview with fans, director Kevin Smith confirmed that \"Front Row\" was partially inspired by a phone conversation he and Morissette once had. They were mutually attracted to each other but never actually dated. His suggestion of naming the reasons they were not a couple became part of the lyrics."

Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called it a \"clear step forward\" and concluded that \"Morissette is a weird acquired taste, due to her idiosyncratic vocals and doggedly convoluted confessionals \u2013 but [the album] certainly confirms that she doesn't quite sound like anyone else, either.\" The Village Voices Robert Christgau commented that he felt \"privileged to listen along with all the young women whose struggles Morissette blows up to such a scale.\" Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly complimented Morissette's new style and wrote that \"Morissette has used her year-plus recording hiatus and newfound star status wisely, in pursuit of a way to make a vulnerable, openhearted album in the face of intense commercial expectations.\" Slant Magazine critic Sal Cinquemani complimented Morissette's songwriting and concluded that while the album \"is nearly 15 minutes too long (did an ode to her mother, the sweet 'Heart of the House,' really need to be made public?)... not one moment of Junkies 70-plus minutes is less than captivating.\" Despite the B+ grade from Ken Tucker in 1998, fellow Entertainment Weekly music critic David Browne was much harsher. In the Spring 2000 Tenth Anniversary issue of Entertainment Weekly, in a retrospective article discussing popular music in the 1990s, Browne wrote \"Musically speaking, easy targets abounded--does anyone beyond family remember Hammer's gangsta makeover or Vanilla Ice's live album? At least we could laugh at those, whereas the decade's foremost clunker--Alanis Morisette's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie--was corporate grunge and victim-culture whining incarnate.\" However, it was also listed amongst \"the worst albums ever\" by Q magazine."

In the fall of 1998, she embarked on a club tour across North America with select appearances in Europe, Asia and Australia. The North American leg of the tour included opening act Chris Whitley. Guitarist Nick Lashley and bassist Chris Chaney remained for this album's touring from the previous years, although there were several new band members. The band now incorporated a keyboardist, Deron Johnson, and welcomed guitarist Joel Shearer (from the Jagged Little Pill recording sessions) and drummer Gary Novak. Morissette herself continued playing guitar (however more so than previous tours) and harmonica. She also started playing the flute in concerts, during the song \"That I Would Be Good\". In January 1999, \"The Junkie Tour\" kicked off, and lasted through July, then returned in October up until the end of December. Opening acts included Garbage and Liz Phair, among others. The worldwide tour had alternating setlists for every leg, but included the usual set openers and closers. The concert introduction music was a track from DJ Shadow, entitled \"Building Steam with a Grain of Salt\". During the tour, Morissette wrote the song \"Still\" for the Kevin Smith film, Dogma. This song was performed live for the first time in July at Morissette's VH1 Storytellers special. After that special, she performed in front of thousands during the Woodstock '99 concert festival in New York. Unlike the previous tours, Morissette focused mainly on performing songs that had been released and didn't perform any new songs, aside from a couple of B-sides during the second half of the year. In May, Morissette and Tori Amos announced the \"5 Week Tour\" which filled the touring void in August and September before \"The Junkie Tour\" re-commenced. The tour would be a joint venture, as they both co-headlined the bills. Toward the end of the tour, Morissette recorded her MTV Unplugged concert special. During the final weeks of \"The Junkie Tour\", keyboardist Deron Johnson left the band and was replaced, and Gary Novak took a temporary leave and was replaced as well. Morissette announced a summer tour in 2000 called \"The One Tour\" which kicked off with two dates in North America, before continuing in places she had never toured (or rarely toured) before across Europe and parts of Asia. In each city, she selected an ambassador through a website contest on \"Z.com\", to show her around and teach her the culture. It was after this tour that Morissette kicked off MSN and DirecTV's concert series, Music in High Places where she performed acoustic on the Navajo Nation in Arizona, and also learned the cultures, practices, traditions and songs from the natives in the area. This was Morissette's final performance and release that tied into promotion for Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie before she started writing her follow-up, Under Rug Swept."

It charted considerably high in initial airplay because of the anticipation for the album, but many critics and listeners who had pigeonholed Morissette as an angry woman were surprised by the song's calm and serene feel. Released in November, the album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with the highest first-week sales for a female artist at the time, selling 469,054 copies in its first seven days. She held this record for two years, until being outsold in first week sales by Britney Spears' Oops!...I Did It Again which sold 1.3 million copies in 2000. It held the number-one spot for an additional week, before falling to eighth place in what is generally a busy shopping period because of the holiday season. Over the next few weeks sales for the album slowly declined, and then faltered drastically. After 28 weeks, the album had fallen off the Billboard 200, and as of September 2008 it had sold 2.6 million copies in the US, less than a fifth in sales of that of Jagged Little Pill. Though not an official single release in the US, \"Joining You\" became a modest hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart; it was released as the album's second single in the UK and Europe. \"Unsent\", the second US single, peaked outside the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The third single \"So Pure\" made the top 40 in the UK as well as certain airplay charts in the US, though not the Billboard Hot 100. None of the singles revived significant interest in the album."

This version of \"Can't Not\", however, was slightly more mellow\u2014and differed from the demo version previewed on the home video, Jagged Little Pill, Live. The song \"King of Intimidation\" (also previewed on the video) was never released on any album until the Jagged Little Pill 2015 deluxe edition, but appeared in a live clip along with the original \"Can't Not\" live clip on 2005's The Collection DVD. \"No Pressure Over Cappuccino\" was another song that popped up from the previous tours, but not until 1999's live album, Alanis Unplugged. This song was previewed on the above-mentioned video, but only in acoustic form. That version is mistakenly believed to be a studio demo, but it is merely an acoustic version performed with the band. The final song previewed on Jagged Little Pill, Live is \"Death of Cinderella\"; Alanis debuted the song live on December 6, 1995. It had never been released until the Jagged Little Pill 2015 deluxe edition. Other songs include \"Gorgeous\", \"London\", \"Pray for Peace\" (a.k.a. \"She Gave Me a Wink\") which has never been released but she played it for the first time in concert on October 18, 1997, and two untitled songs that fans refer to as \"The Weekend Song\" (or \"I Don't Know\") which debuted in concert on February 4, 1996, and \"After A Year Like This One\" on July 12, 1996. A live version of \"London\" appeared as a B-side to the \"Joining You\" and \"Unsent\" singles. The studio version was later released on the Jagged Little Pill 2015 deluxe edition with \"Gorgeous\" as well. Both songs debuted in concert on June 8, 1997. Aside from the songs written and performed during concerts 1995\u20131997, there were songs specifically written for Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. \"Pollyanna Flower\" was released as a B-side to \"Thank U\", while \"These Are The Thoughts\" appeared on the single to \"Joining You\" (and later on Alanis Unplugged). \"Can't Not\" was originally intended to be a B-side, but Morissette and Ballard decided to put it on the record. Another song left off the album was \"Princes Familiar\", whose studio version has yet to surface. It has only been released in live, acoustic form on both Alanis Unplugged and The Collection"

Each was given the funds to record one side of their next (and presumed final, at the time) album, Apart. Both worked in the same Hamburg studio, M.O.B., with engineer Blank Fontana and guitarist G\u00fcnter Schulz, but never interacted with each other directly. These sessions would be the last time the group worked with Fontana at M.O.B. After the two halves were combined and pressed onto an album, Esch's half was rejected by Wax Trax! Records's executives, who didn't think it sounded like KMFDM. The record company gave Konietzko additional funds to record more songs. He finished the album by including new remixes of previously released material. After yet another tracklist revision by Konietzko, he changed the title to Money, and later reconciled with Esch in the later stages of the album's production. A number of other tracks intended for the album ended up on other albums or singles. The album cover includes a self-portrait of long time KMFDM artist Aidan Hughes, who appears as the man on the left side of the cover. The album's cover came about after Hughes experienced \"artistic block\" because he usually tried to base his artwork on the music as closely as possible; Konietzko allowed him more freedom to create cover art, so Hughes became inspired to create the cover for Money based on his own personal experience instead. Hughes related that the image represents \"my disillusionment with the street lifestyle I was experiencing at the time, and the art carries with it the implication that no matter what temptation lies in your path, you still gotta pay!\""

He noted that there were only seven new tracks, and that the rest were either remixes or remakes of songs from Na\u00efve, KMFDM's previous album.  However, he said that the new tracks were \"for the most part aggressive, ferocious songs...  with surprisingly strong musicianship\".  He called \"Sex on the Flag\" the album's best song, and its chorus \"addictive\".  He also said that the album's first two tracks were \"exceptional and entertaining\".  He concluded by calling the album \"very strong and fierce but... actually quite easy to listen to\". Chuck Eddy of Spin magazine was less complimentary.  He said KMFDM was \"concentrating on atmosphere now, not songs\".  He went on to say that \"there are some neat little touches\", but that \"the drone-y dinks barely coalesce into hooks\".

Single success did come a few months later in the UK, when a duet with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, \"Till I Loved You\", became a hit in the summer of 1989. The record company however failed to capitalise on this by not repromoting the album. Notable tracks on this album include \"Same Heart\" - a duet with Michael Bolton, although this came a year before his international breakthrough (another opportunity for repromotion), and \"Remind My Heart\" which is a collaboration with producer Jellybean Benitez who was then at the peak of his fame."

This led to stage performances that included up to four guitarists playing at once. The album had sold 20,000 copies by February 1994, and went on to sell more than 100,000 copies by October 1995. A digitally remastered reissue of Angst was released by Metropolis Records on 21 November 2006."

He called \"A Drug Against War\" \"the band's most over-the-top moment to date\" and thought \"Sucks\" was funny and irreverent. He concluded by calling Angst a great album for KMFDM newcomers. Ira Robbins called Angst \"the fulfillment of Money's promise, a meld of pop choruses, metal guitar riffs and industrial machine-beats\". Colin Larkin said Angst \"perfected the band's aggressive fusion of pounding electro rhythms and screeching guitars.\" Angst was given a Silver Salute by CMJ New Music Report in 2003, with Brad Filicky saying, \"KMFDM managed to make people laugh, even as they were checking under their beds for monsters and finding the inspiration to plug their guitars into a MIDI unit.\""

In the three Godfather films, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Michael was portrayed by Al Pacino, for which he was twice-nominated for Academy Awards. Michael is the youngest son of Vito Corleone, a Sicilian immigrant who builds a Mafia empire. Upon his father's death, Michael succeeds him as the don of the Corleone crime family. In June 2003, Michael Corleone was recognized as the 11th most iconic villain in film history by the American Film Institute, although some critics consider him to be a tragic hero. The British Empire film magazine selected Michael Corleone as the 11th greatest movie character."

        "content": "Unlike his two older brothers, Michael wants nothing to do with the Corleone \"family business\", wanting instead to lead a more Americanized life. Vito does not want Michael to join the Corleone criminal empire either, hoping that his favorite son would go into politics. Michael was enrolled at Dartmouth College, but dropped out to enlist in the United States Marine Corps the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. During World War II, he fights in the Pacific War, and is wounded in battle. For his bravery, he received a battlefield commission to the rank of Lieutenant, and was awarded the Silver Star and the Navy Cross. He was discharged as a Captain of Marines after V-J Day in the fall of 1945. His heroics during the war were featured in Life magazine. During the autumn of 1945, Michael is discharged from the Marines, unaware that Vito secretly arranged for his discharge, using his political influence. Michael returns home to attend his sister Connie's wedding, accompanied by Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), his college sweetheart. Michael stays for a few weeks before intending to re-enter college without telling his family. Just before Christmas 1945, Vito is critically wounded in an assassination attempt by drug kingpin Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), pushing a reluctant Michael into the Mafia world he has avoided for so long. Arriving at the hospital, he finds his bedridden father unprotected from potential attack. While awaiting Corleone reinforcements, Michael prevents a second assassination attempt on Vito by Sollozzo, then affirms his loyalty to his father. Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), a corrupt NYPD Captain on Sollozzo's payroll, breaks Michael's jaw before more Corleone button men arrive. As Vito Corleone recuperates, Sollozzo requests that Michael broker a truce, but acting boss Sonny, suspecting a trap, refuses and demands the other Mafia families hand over Sollozzo to the Corleone family or else face war. Michael volunteers to meet Sollozzo in a public place and kill him and McCluskey. Hagen warns that killing McCluskey would violate a long-standing Mafia rule not to kill police officers, and says it would incite deadly backlash from rival Mafia families and law enforcement. Michael argues they can publicly expose McCluskey as a corrupt cop involved in the drug trade and serving as Sollozzo's bodyguard, contending that McCluskey has crossed into their world and is fair game. Sonny agrees and approves the hit. After careful preparation, Michael meets with Sollozzo and McCluskey at an Italian restaurant in The Bronx. He retrieves a handgun that Corleone caporegime Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano) had planted beforehand in the bathroom and kills Sollozzo and McCluskey by shooting them at point-blank range. This ignites the New York underworld's first Mafia war in a decade. Michael escapes to Sicily and spends two years under Corleone ally Don Tommasino's (Corrado Gaipa) protection. Michael falls in love with and marries a young local woman named Apollonia Vitelli (Simonetta Stefanelli). Back in the United States, Sonny is murdered. After Michael is notified of Sonny's murder, he and Apollonia prepare to move to Siracusa, but she is killed by a car bomb meant for Michael, proving the other Mafia families know where he is hiding. Michael returns to the United States in 1950 and assumes Sonny's role as Vito's heir apparent. After Vito's suspicions are confirmed that Don Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte), his main rival in New York City, is the mastermind of his shooting and Sonny's murder, he and Michael begin a secret, complex plot to wipe out the other New York Dons. They deliberately allow their rivals to whittle away at Corleone interests to lull them into inaction. Meanwhile, Michael convinces his father that it is time to remove the family from crime. More than a year following his return, Michael reunites with Kay and they marry. He promises her the Corleone family will be completely legitimate in five years. Within three years, they have two children, Anthony and Mary. Vito semi-retires in 1954, and Michael becomes operating head of the family. He offers to buy out casino owner Moe Greene's (Alex Rocco) stake in the Las Vegas casino that the Corleones bankrolled, intending to move the family to Nevada as part of his effort to legitimize the Corleone interests; Greene refuses to sell. Corleone family caporegimes Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda) and Clemenza request permission to begin operating their own families in Corleone territory. Michael, with Vito's support, advises them to be patient and wait until the move to Las Vegas is completed. Tessio and Clemenza agree, but are clearly dissatisfied. In 1955, Vito warns Michael that Barzini will likely attempt to assassinate Michael under the pretense of negotiating peace between the families, using a disloyal contact within the Corleone regime. Whoever approaches Michael about the meeting, Vito explains, will be the traitor within the family. Shortly thereafter, Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with his grandson Anthony in his tomato garden. At Vito's funeral, Tessio tells Michael that Barzini wants to arrange a meeting, confirming Vito's prediction. Michael sets his plan in motion to murder the other New York Mafia heads: Barzini, Philip Tattaglia (Victor Rendina), Carmine Cuneo (Rudy Bond), and Victor Stracci (Don Costello), as well as Greene. The plot unfolds on the same day Michael stands as godfather to Connie's newborn son. Later the same day, he has Tessio and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), Connie's abusive husband who conspired in Sonny's murder, executed. In one stroke, Michael re-establishes the Corleone family as the nation's most powerful crime family, and establishes a reputation as being even more cunning and ruthless than his father. A few days later, Connie furiously accuses Michael of murdering Carlo. When challenged by Kay, Michael denies having ordered Carlo's murder. Kay, initially believing Michael, later observes him receiving his capos. Clemenza addresses Michael as \"Don Corleone\" and kisses his hand in the same manner that he did with Michael's father. Kay realizes Connie's accusations were true, and that Michael has become his father's successor in every way. In the novel, Kay leaves Michael, but Hagen persuades her to return."

        "title": "Michael Corleone_The Godfather Part II",
        "content": "The Godfather Part II is set in 1958 and 1959. The Corleone family has relocated to Nevada, while capo Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) runs the family's operations in New York, Clemenza having died a few years before. Although Michael is the most powerful Mafia leader in the nation, he still actively works to remove the Corleone family from crime. His efforts have been largely unsuccessful, however, as his many enemies and growing obsession with revenge keep him tethered to the criminal underworld. Michael plans to finally legitimize the family by negotiating with Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), his father's former business partner, over controlling casino operations in Cuba. Hours after Anthony's First Communion party, unseen gunmen shoot at the Corleone house, nearly killing Michael and Kay. Michael suspects Roth ordered the hit, and believes a mole within the Corleone family aided him. To uncover Roth's involvement, Michael maintains their business relationship, and orders Pentangeli to settle a dispute with Roth's business partners, the Rosato Brothers. When Pentangeli meets with them, they try to kill him, but he survives. Michael, Roth, and Fredo travel to Cuba to forge a partnership with Fulgencio Batista allowing them to operate casinos in Cuba without interference in exchange for generous payments to the Cuban government. Michael sends his bodyguard to eliminate Roth on New Year's Eve, but Cuban soldiers kill the bodyguard during the attempt. That same night, Fredo unintentionally reveals that he was the mole within the family; Michael confronts Fredo and gives him the Sicilian \"kiss of death\". During the New Year's Eve festivities, victorious rebel forces enter Havana, forcing Batista into exile and ruining Michael's plans. Fredo, afraid of his brother, runs off; Roth escapes to Miami. Meanwhile, Pentangeli, believing Michael had ordered a hit on him, prepares to testify against him in the Senate's investigation of organized crime. However, Michael has Pentangeli's brother Vincenzo (Salvatore Po) brought from Sicily. Just prior to the hearing, Vincenzo and Frank exchange glances. Understanding the threat, Pentangeli recants his earlier sworn statements, throwing the hearings into chaos and effectively destroying the government's case against Michael. Fredo confesses to Michael that Roth's right-hand man, Johnny Ola (Dominic Chianese), had promised to reward him for information about Michael. Fredo says that he resents being \"passed over\" to head the family in favor of Michael, and that he withheld key information about the Senate investigation. Michael disowns Fredo, and tells his personal assassin Al Neri that nothing is to happen to his brother while their mother is alive \u2014 the implication being that Neri is to kill Fredo after she dies. Meanwhile, Kay decides to leave Michael and take their children with her, believing Michael will always live in a world of crime and violence. Michael asks her to reconsider, but Kay reveals she aborted their unborn son because she refused to bring another of his children into the world. Enraged, Michael hits Kay in the face and severs ties with her, taking custody of Anthony and Mary. Following their mother's death, and at Connie's behest, Michael seemingly forgives Fredo, but it is actually a ploy to draw him in closer in order to have him killed. Soon after, Neri murders Fredo on Michael's orders. At the same time, Michael sends Hagen to persuade Pentangeli to commit suicide to spare his family, and has caporegime Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui) kill a heavily guarded Roth at Idlewild Airport upon his return to the U.S. The film ends as Michael recalls a surprise birthday party for his father on December 7, 1941. In a flashback scene, Michael informs the family that he has dropped out of college to enlist in the Marines. Only Fredo supports Michael's decision. When Vito arrives off-screen, everyone goes to greet him except Michael, who sits alone. The film closes with Michael sitting alone in the Corleones' Lake Tahoe compound."

        "content": "The Godfather Part III is set in 1979 and 1980. Michael has moved back to New York and taken great strides to remove the family from crime. He turns over his New York criminal interests to longtime enforcer Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna). Ridden with guilt over his ruthless rise to power, he uses his wealth in an attempt to rehabilitate his reputation through numerous acts of charity, administered by a foundation named after his father. A decade earlier, he gave custody of his two children to Kay, who has since remarried. He sells his gambling interests to the other Mafia families and reorganizes his vast business holdings as the \"Corleone Group\". The Holy See has named him a Commander of the Order of Saint Sebastian for his charitable works and large donations to Catholic institutions. At the ceremony, Michael and Kay have an uneasy reunion after nine years. Kay supports their son Anthony's (Franc D'Ambrosio) decision to reject the \"family business\" and become an opera singer, and tells Michael that both she and Anthony know the truth about Fredo's death. Michael had initially wanted Anthony to either finish law school or join the family business, but consents to Anthony going his own way. Michael's new connection to the Church provides an opportunity to take over the large property company, Immobiliare. He is already its largest shareholder, and offers to buy the Vatican's 25 percent share, which will give him controlling interest. He also takes in Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), a soldier in Zasa's crew, as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Michael recognizes that Vincent has inherited Sonny's fiery temper and fears Vincent will suffer his father's fate. Michael also disapproves of the romance developing between Vincent and Michael's daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola). Michael fears that Vincent's growing involvement in the Mafia will endanger Mary, just as it did Michael's first wife, Apollonia. On the night Michael announces he is dissolving his gambling empire, Zasa wipes out most of The Commission in a helicopter attack in Atlantic City. Michael escapes with help from Vincent and Neri. Michael realizes that his old friend, Don Altobello (Eli Wallach), is the brains behind the attempt on his life. Traumatized by the attack, Michael suffers a diabetic stroke, briefly incapacitating him. (Francis Ford Coppola reveals in his audio commentary that Michael is frequently seen drinking water in the first two films\u2014subtle hints that he is a diabetic.) While Michael recovers, Connie gives Vincent her consent to assassinate Zasa. Michael is angry upon discovering this, and demands that no similar orders be issued while he is alive. Michael returns to Sicily for Anthony's operatic debut at the Teatro Massimo. Suspecting that Altobello may make another attempt on his life, he has Vincent infiltrate Altobello's regime under the pretense of defecting. Michael and Kay tour Sicily together, during which Michael asks for Kay's forgiveness. Kay admits she will always love him, and they begin to rekindle their relationship. Meanwhile, the Immobiliare deal has stalled, supposedly because the critically ill Pope Paul VI must personally approve it. Michael learns that the Immobiliare deal is an elaborate swindle concocted by Immobiliare chairman Licio Lucchesi (Enzo Robutti), who schemed with Vatican Bank head Archbishop Gilday (Donal Donnelly) and accountant Frederick Keinszig (Helmut Berger) to embezzle a fortune from the Vatican Bank, using Michael's \"investment\" to cover their tracks. Hoping to salvage the deal, Michael seeks Don Tommasino's assistance. He directs Michael to Cardinal Lamberto (Raf Vallone), the future Pope John Paul I. With Lamberto's prodding, Michael makes his first confession in 30 years, tearfully breaking down as he admits to ordering Fredo's murder. Lamberto tells Michael he deserves to suffer for his terrible sins, but that there is hope for his redemption. John Paul I dies soon after being elected pope, poisoned by Gilday. Michael learns that Altobello (in league with the conspirators) has hired an assassin named Mosca (Mario Donatone) to kill him. Mosca murders Tommasino, and Michael vows before his old friend's casket to sin no more. Vincent reports that Lucchesi, working with Altobello, is behind the assassination attempts on Michael. Weary of the bloody, lonely life of a Don, Michael retires, making Vincent his successor, but not before giving him permission to retaliate. In return, Vincent agrees to end his romance with Mary. That night, Michael, reconciled with Kay and Anthony, watches his son's performance in the opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Meanwhile, Vincent has Lucchesi, Gilday and Keinszig murdered; Lucchesi is stabbed to death in his office by Tommasino's longtime bodyguard, Cal\u00f2, Gilday is shot to death by Neri on the cathedral stairs and Keinszig is abducted, suffocated and left to hang from a bridge, and Connie murders Altobello with a poisoned cannoli. After the performance, Mosca shoots Michael, wounding him, and a second bullet hits Mary, killing her. Mary's death breaks Michael's spirit, and he screams in agony over her body. In an epilogue scene set in 1997, an elderly Michael (age 77) lives alone in Don Tommasino's villa. Sitting in the same courtyard where he married Apollonia, he suddenly slumps over in his chair and falls to the ground. In the December 2020 release of The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, a recut of the third film, the final scene is re-edited to make Michael's death more indefinite."

Although it was not released until 1992, some of the material on the album was recorded as early as 1987. Select tracks from the album had served as intro music to early Danzig shows, and excerpts of some songs were included on Danzig's first two compilation home videos released by Def American Recordings in 1989 and 1991. The first six song titles reference a soundtrack to John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost, which describes Lucifer's rebellion from the Christian God, and his subsequent expulsion from Heaven with the angels who joined him. The final three tracks, written by Danzig while he was still in Samhain, reference Celtic mythology. \"The Morrigu\" relates to The Morr\u00edgan, a mythical phantom queen. \"Cwn Annwn\" refers to the spectral hounds of the same name. All tracks were written by Glenn Danzig, who also performed all instruments. Engineering was provided by Nick Didia, Martin Schmelze, and Bob Alecca.

However, he felt the track selection was \"a little off whack\", particularly the inclusion of \"Mother\", which he found to be \"such an integral part of the initial Plastic Ono Band album that I feel it's manifestly unfair to both artist and public to include it on an album of this nature.\" A Creem magazine reader's poll in 1975 included the album among the top five \"Best Reissues\" of 1975, placing fourth, behind two Rolling Stones compilations, Made in the Shade and Metamorphosis, and Bob Dylan's The Basement Tapes."

        "content": "Impossible Princess (briefly retitled Kylie Minogue in Europe) is the sixth studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue, released on 22\u00a0October 1997, by Deconstruction, BMG and Mushroom Records. The singer asserted partial creative control over the project\u2014as a co-producer and composer of the material\u2014assisted by Brothers in Rhythm, Manic Street Preachers, David Ball and Rob Dougan. Influenced by the techno and Britpop revolution in the mid-to-late 1990s, sonically Impossible Princess is a departure from Minogue's previous work. Conceived as an experimental record, the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from the dance genre, including trip hop, electronica, and rock. Lyrically, the album's focus is on Minogue's self-discovery after a series of trips around the world, and delves into freedom of expression, relationships and emotions. Upon its release, critical and public reception of Impossible Princess was divided over its new musical direction and Minogue's very intimate lyrics. In retrospect, described as an underrated release, the record has achieved widespread critical acclaim and Minogue's creative input and its mixture of genres have been widely praised. Commercially, the album reached the top 10 in Australia, Scotland and the United Kingdom, and was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for physical shipments of 70,000 units; however, the British media mocked its lack of success in Europe. Four singles were released from the album: \"Some Kind of Bliss\", \"Did It Again\", \"Breathe\", and \"Cowboy Style\", each of which experienced moderate success. After a small promotional tour in 1997, Minogue embarked on the Intimate and Live tour in Australia and the UK the following year, which was a commercial and critical success. Since the album's release, various commentators have cited Impossible Princess as Minogue's best work, It has earned numerous nominations and recognition on best-ever lists. Despite this, Minogue has said she will never create another studio album of personal songs like Impossible Princess."

        "content": "Minogue left her label PWL in 1992 because of creative differences and signed a three-album deal with Deconstruction Records the following year. She worked with a diverse group of collaborators to experiment with different sounds, including the British duo Brothers in Rhythm. Their first offering was Minogue's self-titled album in late 1994, which peaked at number three in Australia and number four in the United Kingdom. Besides promotional commitments for the album, Minogue expanded her acting career by taking part in several projects. Among them were big-budget films Street Fighter (1994) and Bio-Dome (1996), which were received poorly by critics. Minogue worked with Australian musician Nick Cave and his band, the Bad Seeds on their 1995 single \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\", which peaked at number two in Australia and number eleven in the UK. The song earned three ARIA Awards for Best Pop Release, Single, and Song of the Year in 1996. Minogue's friendship with Cave continued over the years; on Cave's advice, Minogue recited the lyrics to her 1987 song \"I Should Be So Lucky\" as poetry at A Hip Mass: The Superjam \u2013 First International Poetry Day at London's Royal Albert Hall in July 1996. In December, she made a surprise appearance at a Manic Street Preachers concert at the Shepherd's Bush Empire, singing \"Little Baby Nothing\" with them. The track was planned initially as a duet with Minogue but did not materialise during her years under contract with PWL. Both 1996 live performances were viewed as the starting point of her new alter ego\u2014\"IndieKylie\". Minogue began a romantic relationship with French photographer St\u00e9phane Sednaoui and embarked on a series of trips with him throughout North America, Asia, and Australasia to gain inspiration for her upcoming record. By the end of the trip, Minogue was enamoured by the experience and felt \"truly anonymous and free to be [herself]\"."

        "content": "Plans for Impossible Princess began in mid-1995 after meetings with Brothers in Rhythm had taken place and recording the album began. By June 1997, the album had been in production for twenty-one months, and Deconstruction were adding the final touches to it. The album took nearly two years to record\u2014the longest period Minogue had worked on a project since her time acting on the Australian soap opera Neighbours (from 1986 to 1988). Many changes of direction, remixes and cowriters lengthened the process which at times upset and infuriated Minogue. Brothers in Rhythm member Steve Anderson explained this was \"due to the pure perfectionism\" of everyone involved; Minogue commented it was worth the wait. Minogue's trips with Sednaoui, her Deconstruction label mates, and clients of Sednaoui's work including Bj\u00f6rk, Garbage, and Tricky inspired the album. Sednaoui and Cave were key factors during the production. In the biography Kylie (2014), Sean Smith notes Sednaoui had a huge effect on Minogue's belief in herself and contributed to her vision of the future, while Cave helped her to embrace the past. Minogue wrote every track on the album\u2014in contrast, she co-wrote only one song on her 1994 studio album. Minogue began writing lyrics after Sednaoui and Cave convinced her to take creative control over her next musical project. She did not have any specific method for writing: she wrote constantly in her notebook and composed many songs during the holidays. Lyrics and melodies came easily to her. \"Cowboy Style\" and \"Dreams\" were among the earliest songs Minogue wrote for the album. \"Too Far\" was written on a grand piano. It was the easiest track for Minogue to write and also made \"the most sense\" to her. She imagined performing \"Too Far\" while working on the lyrics, which she did at a local cafe. Minogue called it \"a nice form of release\" that did not sound like anything she had written before. Several songs contain live instrumental tracks, such as a trumpet solo on \"Through the Years\", Minogue's first record to incorporate them. She found this unusual because she was familiar only with the use of synthesizers on her tracks. Minogue considered the album \"a nice mixture between the synthetic and real instruments\"."

        "content": "Brothers in Rhythm put together a few songs initially planned for Impossible Princess but scrapped them because Minogue had started writing and they saw she had development as an artist. In order to work closely with Brothers in Rhythm, Minogue shared a house with them across the road from the Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire, where each morning she would present a set of lyrics from the night before to Brothers in Rhythm producer Dave Seaman. Minogue then sang her ideas for the melody to the duo who tried to compose the backing tracks, find a suitable style, record rough demos, and add subtle lyric and melody ideas to each of them. Production took place mainly at Real World, where the rough demos were rearranged. Strings were added at Sarm West Studios in London, and the tracks were then sent back to Real World for the final mixes, handled by engineer Alan Bremner. From those sessions, they completed their first track \"You're the One\", which remains unreleased. Brothers in Rhythm developed five more songs at Real World that ended up on the final tracklist: \"Did It Again\", \"Limbo\", \"Dreams\", \"Say Hey\", and \"Cowboy Style\". \"Too Far\" was written at Sarm West, where Anderson came up with the piano line on the final version. According to Anderson, the production grew as the song was created, and many ideas on the demos made it onto the finished tracks. \"Limbo\", \"Too Far\", \"Did It Again\" and \"Cowboy Style\", were released in their original demo form because Minogue felt the \"raw[ness]\" of the tracks worked better than being polished. Anderson considered \"Too Far\" and \"Drunk\" to be the examples of Minogue's \"artistic progression, brought about by artistic freedom\". He felt that Minogue's lyrics were \"pure poetry and a long way from a standard pop song structure\" and her songs show \"a real artistic moment\" and \"true brilliance\". Many songs were cut from the final tracklist, including \"Take Me With You\", \"Love Takes Over Me\", \"Free\", and \"Stay This Way\". Written quickly, and recorded in one take, Anderson felt \"Stay This Way\" was one of Minogue's best, but the record had no place for a torch song. Tracks like \"Floating\" and \"Looking Down On Me\" which had been recorded at these sessions were made available only as demos. Pete Hadfield, the label's director, was ill, leaving Minogue to take partial creative control over the project. To help produce the album, she attended each session with Anderson and Seaman to learn about composing, arranging instruments, and \"distorting\" sections of the album's tracks. As a result, she is credited as a co-producer with Brothers in Rhythm on the songs \"Too Far\", \"Breathe\", and \"Say Hey\"; she played the synthesizer and provided backing vocals."

        "content": "At one point, Deconstruction felt Minogue's sessions with Brothers in Rhythm had not produced enough tracks suitable to release as singles. They encouraged her to work with other artists. Like she had done on her 1994 album, Minogue wanted to experiment with a group of different producers in order to \"free herself\". She was open to the idea of collaborating to create \"something that ... [she] otherwise wouldn't have\". She wrote \"Through The Years\", \"Breathe\", and \"Limbo\" during her sessions with the electronic producers Dave Ball and Ingo Vauk at their home studios; Minogue wrote the lyrics to \"Through the Years\" within 10 minutes of hearing Ball and Vauk's track. Minogue had heard of Rob Dougan's work and thought that it would be interesting to work with him; they wrote and produced \"Jump\". She worked on two songs with English band Olive, but they were scrapped. Cave wrote a track for the album based on Minogue's lyrics, entitled \"Soon\", but she was disappointed with her recording and dropped it. She recalled, \"It's a beautiful ballad but I just didn't do it justice, I'm afraid\". Minogue said that James Dean Bradfield of Manic Street Preachers \"had a very clear idea\" of how he wanted her to sound during their first session at his home. Minogue found it \"difficult\" to re-write Bradfield's demo of \"I Don't Need Anyone\", so he had taken pieces of the original demo lyrics and mixed them with other lyrics she had written, with help from Nicky Wire, to create the finished version of \"I Don't Need Anyone\". She found this method of writing \"intriguing\" and wanted to do it again. She worked with Bradfield and Sean Moore on \"Some Kind of Bliss\". Commenting on this method of songwriting, Minogue said, \"He took one half of one set [of lyrics] and took another half from another set of lyrics and merged them together, which I found interesting because it was something I wouldn't have done because, in my mind they're two separate things.\" She later said she felt the lyrics worked together. Bradfield and frequent collaborator Dave Eringa produced both tracks."

        "title": "Impossible Princess_Music and lyrics",
        "content": "Musically, Impossible Princess experiments and blends different musical styles, as Minogue wanted the album to reflect her many sides. It is a departure from her previous sound, encompassing various elements from the dance genre. Who magazine highlighted its musical diversity, ranging from trip hop, torch songs to scratchy guitar pop, and disco tracks. Sputnikmusic writers pointed out trance, rock, and alternative influences, and described the album as \"something you would expect Bj\u00f6rk to make\". Marcel Anders of Orkus labelled it a straightforward dance record, though he noted some tracks were heavily \"guitar-driven\". Nick Levine at Digital Spy noted the album is \"all over the dance-pop shop\" and \"stuffed with slap-you-round-the-chops pop stompers\". Michael Dwyer of The West Australian commented that while Minogue is \"still a dancing queen at heart\", it is the club-oriented production that made the album standout. Chris True of AllMusic believed that Minogue's transition to more mature dance-oriented music, outside her typical sound, expanded on \"the dance-pop that was her bread and butter\". He described the album as a collection of \"[abundant] guitars and experimental vocal tracks\". True and Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine identified the record as part of the electronica and Britpop revolution that spanned the mid-to-late 1990s. The record's  vocals feature segments of spoken word and rapping, alongside whispering and singing. John Mangan of Australia's The Age newspaper felt the songs sounded \"as though they were written around her sweet voice\". Who noted Minogue was developing her own voice on the album, saying she is \"whispering breathlessly one moment, shrieking like a young Sinead O'Connor the next\". Another writer from the same publication felt that Minogue \"never sounded better or more human\", praising her unique phrasing. In the biography Kylie: Naked (2012), Nigel Goodall and Jenny Stanley-Clarke likened Minogue's vocals to those of Tori Amos, Bj\u00f6rk, Sinead O\u2019Connor, Kate Bush and Madonna. Cinquemani and Dwyer also compared Minogue's vocal delivery to Madonna. Dwyer described Minogue's whisper as a \"sexy [and] reliable secret weapon\". Larry Flick of Billboard commented that Minogue had dropped the \"pitch-perfect diva\" vocals and \"let the odd noises flow freely\" on the album. Lyrically, most of the album deals with the theme of romantic relationships, self-discovery and freedom of expression. Dave Seaman noted that Minogue's input was more significant on this album and that most of the album's subjects were \"her own ideas\" and that she wanted to grow as a person from this experience. Most of the album is autobiographical, based upon Minogue's life during the two years preceding the album. Sean Smith believed the songs reveal Minogue's life more than any interview, and they were \"complex, serious, introspective and challenging\" in contrast with her \"crooning love songs\" on the previous albums. Flick felt that Minogue \"[liberated] darker thoughts from her subconscious\", highlighting the \"intelligent, often self-examining words\" of \"Limbo\" and \"Say Hey\"."

        "content": "Several darker tunes open the album. The first is the chaotic drum and bass composition \"Too Far\", in which Minogue discuss her paranoia, pain and anger. She sings in a quick, rambling way about suffering from claustrophobia, feeling she \"couldn't find a way out\". Cinquemani described it as a mixture of \"crisp breakbeats with a Moby-style piano progression and lush strings\". Negative stories that the British press had published about Minogue inspired \"Did It Again\", a rock song heavily influenced by Middle Eastern beats. The track sees Minogue struggling to find the right identity. She uses an aggressive vocal style and whines about how she is messed up despite having it all. The track blends drums and electric guitar, which Smith found similar to the sound of The Beatles' Revolver (1966). The guitar-driven tune \"I Don't Need Anyone\" does not have a linear storyline. Minogue told Deconstruction that it was taken from four songs, each interpreting a different mood and story. Cinquemani notes the energetic Britpop track sees Minogue wildly declare her independence while admitting her inborn vulnerability. The dark trip hop number \"Jump\" advises the public to accept her and her personal choices throughout the course of her career. Other material consists of softer tunes, including the joyful Britpop number \"Some Kind of Bliss\", which talks about Minogue's experiences while away from people and being happy. Several critics compared the song to Motown music and Manic Street Preachers. Written in Japan, the fifth track, \"Breathe\", is a subtle electronica song that expresses Minogue's ability to contemplate and feel peaceful while in an intense environment. Another electronic-infused tune is \"Say Hey\", which Minogue proclaims is a \"late-night, early-morning\" type of song. The lyrics, although inspired by her relationship with Sednaoui, highlight the need for communication, though not delving into conversation. \"Dreams\", the album's closing song, is an orchestral pop ballad discussing the persistence of pushing boundaries and experimentation throughout her career. Ian Phillips of Sputnikmusic wrote that the cinematic track uses \"eerie-sounding strings, booming bass, and crashing drums\" to tell a thought-provoking fairytale. The record's remaining tracks discuss her relationship with Sednaoui. The first track on the album to introduce their relationship is \"Cowboy Style\", a country number that was influenced by Celtic and tribal percussion. It details Minogue meeting Sednaoui for the first time. The theme of frustration lingers in the album's seventh track, the techno-induced \"Drunk\", which has Minogue feeling unsatisfied with the relationship, despite having so much feeling for someone. Minogue wrote \"Limbo\", a hybrid between rock, techno and drum and bass beats, in Spain. She discusses her inability to leave a certain country to meet someone, because of problems with its bureaucracy. Apart from Sednaoui, Minogue mentions meeting an ex-boyfriend on \"Through the Years\", feeling insecure and doubtful about the entire situation; Cinquemani compared the composition to Bj\u00f6rk's single \"Venus as a Boy\"."

        "content": "Sednaoui shot the images and designed the cover sleeve. Inspired by French and Japanese pop culture, Sednaoui took inspiration from Nobuyoshi Araki's erotic work and tried to convey a similar aesthetic to the photos. Initially, the cover art was based on a string of experimental images of Minogue in geisha costume; the concept was later revisited for the music video of \"GBI (German Bold Italic)\" (1997), Minogue's collaboration with Towa Tei. The final cover depicts Minogue sitting and surrounded by swirling multi-coloured lights, dressed in a blue sleeveless V\u00e9ronique Leroy minidress. Because Deconstruction wanted to distribute a limited-edition version of the album with a hologram sleeve, Sednaoui had to photograph separate artwork for those editions. The three dimensional lenticular sleeve required multiple static cameras to shoot Minogue in the dark. To create the long-exposure effect of the lights circulating around the singer, Sednaoui fully dressed in a black bodysuit so he could not be seen in the final shot. The shoot took a week to complete, and Minogue had to pose for hours. She remarked \"the shoot was so very difficult but we knew that once we got it right it would be amazing\". In 2004, Minogue donated the dress worn for the cover shot to the Cultural Gifts Program of the Arts Centre Melbourne. The record's title is a reference to the 1994 novel, Poems to Break the Harts of Impossible Princesses, written by Billy Childish. A copy of the book had been dedicated to Minogue but was accidentally passed on to Nick Cave, who eventually gave it to Minogue not long after, when she started working on the album. She recalled only looking at the title of the book and saying, \"It had me written all over it.\" Additionally, she believed the book's poems summarised where she was at that point in her life under the spotlight. Minogue considered the title to be ironic, imaginary and that it conjured up \"a lot of truths\" from her  life, saying, \"Sometimes my life feels so good that it's almost too much\u2013it's like a joke\u2013and sometimes it should be so good... but it doesn't feel that way.\" The title is referenced in the chorus of album track \"Dreams\": \"These are the dreams of an impossible princess\"."

Even with copies of the album already printed in mid-1997, it was delayed again to September. On 31\u00a0August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a car accident. Because of the impact of her death, Minogue and Deconstruction felt the album's title was \"insensitive\" and \"inappropriate\" and delayed its release for three months. The album missed the planned January 1998 release. Frustrated with the constant delays, Minogue came to an agreement with her label to re-title it Kylie Minogue in Europe and the United Kingdom. It is her third self-titled studio album, following her debut in 1988 and her 1994 album. Released on 28\u00a0March 1998, the album had the original cover design; the 1997 copyright year; and Minogue's tribute to Sednaoui in the credits, despite having ended their relationship in late 1997. On 22\u00a0October 1997, Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG) released the album in the Japanese market, which included the bonus track \"Tears\", alongside the lenticular cover sleeve, and four additional post cards that included images from the album's photoshoot. The following month, Impossible Princess was produced in both CD and cassette formats in Russia and Poland. The standard edition of Impossible Princess was finally made available in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan in early January 1998, and was issued in Europe and the United Kingdom in March that year. The following month, BMG distributed it as a cassette tape in Malaysia, whilst the standard edition with new artwork was released in Taiwan. Deconstruction cancelled plans to release Impossible Princess in North America following the sudden closure of her US distributor Imago Records in late 1994. In May 2003, Impossible Princess was remastered by Festival Mushroom in Australia and New Zealand, and BMG for European and UK regions, as a double CD album; the first disc featured the standard track list, whilst a bonus disc featured remixes and three unreleased recordings: \"Love Takes Over Me\", \"Tears\", and \"This Girl\". The album re-instated the Impossible Princess title in Europe and the United Kingdom upon its re-release. Because of constant delays in 1997, Mushroom Records premiered six of the album tracks\u2014\"Some Kind of Bliss\", \"Too Far\", \"Say Hey\", \"Limbo\", \"I Don't Need Anyone\", and \"Did It Again\"\u2014on a special sample compact disc, and all six recordings were distributed as radio singles to both Australia and New Zealand. Deconstruction conducted a similar promotional campaign in Europe and distributed six different songs on a sample cassette tape. Live and Other Sides was released accompanied by Australian releases of the album at HMV in 1998, with two unreleased Impossible Princess tracks, one unreleased Kylie Minogue track, and three live tracks. The EP was removed from sale and replaced with Other Sides for unknown reasons. Other Sides featured the two B-sides, \"Love Takes Over Me\" and \"Tears\" and an unreleased Impossible Princess track, \"Take Me with You\". Minogue's fourth remix album, Mixes, includes singles from the album; it was released in the UK in August 1998. In Australia, the remix album was replaced by Impossible Remixes, featuring the previously unreleased \"Breathe (TNT Club Mix)\". Several album tracks and three unreleased tracks from Impossible Princess appear on Hits+ (2000) released in Europe."

The promotional campaign was aimed at album buyers, rather than the singles market. The label stressed Minogue's wide-reaching appeal by setting up press cover interviews for her in various markets: broadsheets, dance specialists, tabloids, gay magazines, and style monthlies. During the release week in March 1998, Deconstruction and Minogue held a release party at Tower Records in London. She conducted a small-concert tour travelling to Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong through October 1997; it was her first time in both New Zealand and Hong Kong. Minogue expanded the tour by adding venues in Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands. She appeared on several television shows to promote the album's singles. Although she did not perform any non-singles, she promoted the album's release at the 1998 Mardi Gras ceremony in Sydney, Australia. In May 1998, Minogue confirmed the Intimate and Live concert tour, which began on 2\u00a0June at the Palais Theatre in Melbourne, Australia, that same year. Initially, she wanted to finish the tour in Melbourne on 4\u00a0July, but because of high demand in England, Minogue hosted three additional concert performances there. The tour attracted positive reviews from spectators and publications, praising the idea of a smaller venue show. She received compliments for her vocal performance and her stage presence. Each concert had drawn in approximately 2,000 audience members in Australia, and the media there deemed it a commercial success.

When \"Some Kind of Bliss\" was chosen as the lead single in September 1997, Minogue found it an \"interesting\" choice and \"a good way to start\" promoting the album. David Mould directed the music video shot in the Desert of Tabernas in Spain. It features Dexter Fletcher as Minogue's lover. Released a week after Diana's death, \"Some Kind of Bliss\" was a commercial disappointment: it peaked at number 22 in the UK, Minogue's first single to not reach the top 20 there. It reached number 27 in Australia, and number 46 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, her last charting release there in the 1990s. The album's second single was \"Did It Again\", which was released on 24\u00a0November 1997 with the B-side \"Tears\". Minogue  promoted the single heavily on television in the UK, which led to it peaking at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart in December where it remained for another six weeks. In Australia, it peaked at number 15 and lasted 17 weeks in the top 50, her highest charting, and one of her longest spanning singles on the chart. Petro Romanhi directed the accompanying music video shot in London, in which Minogue portrays four different versions of herself: SexKylie, CuteKylie, IndieKylie, and DanceKylie. The third single from the album was \"Breathe\", released on 9\u00a0March 1998 featuring mixes from Sash! and Todd Terry. It was Minogue's final single for Deconstruction, and her last UK release from Impossible Princess. Welsh film director Kieran Evans directed the accompanying music video in which Minogue floats in an airspace of spiral effects. Minogue performed the single on Top of the Pops and The Ben Elton Show. Unlike the album's previous single, it had only moderate success on the charts, reaching number 23 in Australia and inside the top 20 in the UK. Because of popular demand, \"Too Far\" was released on 12\" vinyl in May 1998 as the only promotional single for Impossible Princess. Two remixes were made for the single: a Brothers in Rhythm remix that contains new vocals and adlibs from Minogue, and an europop remix by Junior Vasquez. \"Too Far\" was planned to be the final single and was to be released commercially as a vinyl triple pack, but these plans were scrapped. Instead, \"Cowboy Style\" was released as the album's final single, with \"Love Takes Over Me\" on the B-side, on 5\u00a0October 1998 and distributed only in Australia. It was not released in the UK because of Minogue's departure from Deconstruction in November. Owing to a limited number of issued formats, the track only charted for a single week at number 39 on the Australian regional top 50."

Magazines like Music Week and Q lambasted the record's repetitious nature, though Music Week acknowledged the improvement in Minogue's vocal range and abilities. Ben Willmott of NME rated it four stars out of 10, criticising the production of collaborator James Dean Bradfield, and labelling Minogue a \"total fraud\" for introducing new musical genres that were disparate from her previous work. In contrast, John Mangan commended the diverse set of styles and Minogue's songwriting skills, saying, \"Impossible Princess sounds right and constitutes another step in the right direction.\" An editor at Who magazine commended Minogue's vocals, calling \"Impossible Princess \"the best, most complete work of her career\". Cameron Adams, writing for the Herald Sun, listed the record as his \"CD of the Week\". He favoured the singles as the album's best tracks, but also said, \"Impossible Princess is her best yet, the classy, personal pop album she has always threatened.\" Michael Dwyer highlighted the \"club-dance\" tracks as the better cuts, adding that, \"Impossible Princess range of styles approaches and collaborators makes it as hard as ever to say just who is making progress here, but progress it most assuredly is.\" Larry Flick described the album as \"stunning\", concluding  Minogue \"has finally found her voice\u2014both literally and spiritually\". In the Encyclopedia of Popular Music (2011), British writer Colin Larkin gave it three out of five stars, classifying it as \"recommended\" and \"highly listenable\". Retrospective reviews of Impossible Princess have been much more positive, with True labelling it a \"pretty damn good record\", and openly denouncing the critical reception after the album's release, deeming it a \"shame\". He believed the album \"sounds stronger and has a more natural feel\" than her previous efforts, and that, \"Impossible Princess actually flows together as an album.\" Sal Cinquemani awarded it four stars, and was impressed with the album's \"starkly personal and unified cord\", saying it \"is the work of an artist willing to take risks, not a pop queen concerned with preserving her reign\". Levine commended the mixture of genres and Minogue's input. Although he noticed the material's lack of commercial appeal, he concluded, \"Brave, revealing and rarely less than surprising, it's a key piece in the trickier-than-you-think jigsaw puzzle that is Kylie Minogue's recording career.\" While reviewing her tenth album X (2007), Evan Sawdey of PopMatters commented, \"For those who still have a copy of her Manic Street Preachers-assisted Impossible Princess, then you have one of the most crazed, damn-near perfect dance-pop albums ever created.\""

It fell to number 22 the following week, and again to number 41, its final charting position was at number 70. The album sold 20,000 copies in the first two weeks of release, just ten percent of the expected sales figures. The album entered its fifth and final week, during the start of May 1998, at number 91. In a similar run, the album charted at number 10 on the Scottish Albums Chart. Impossible Princess had sold 64,483 copies in the UK as of October 2020. The album experienced success on the Australian Albums Chart, where it debuted and peaked at number four on 25\u00a0January 1998. It stalled at number eight during its second and third week, but fell outside the top ten in its fourth. By 26\u00a0April, the album had spent 14 weeks on the chart and was placed at number 48, before leaving the chart. When Minogue promoted the album with live shows, alongside the announcement of a national tour, Impossible Princess re-entered the charts on 10\u00a0May at number 40. Whilst embarking her Intimate and Live tour in June, it entered the top ten for three non-consecutive weeks between the months of June and July. In total, the album appeared in the top 50 for 35 weeks, making it Minogue's longest charting album at the time. Her next studio album, Light Years (2000), spent 41 weeks on the top 50 chart.

        "content": "During its commercial release, Impossible Princess was criticised by the British public, who did not appreciate her move into indie music and electronica. The audience failed to identify with her new intimate image, dubbed as \"IndieKylie\", and was unimpressed with her new musical direction, viewing it as a trend-chasing attempt. The backlash resulted in Impossible Princess making little impact on British record charts, which led British publications to label Impossible Princess Minogue's worst-selling studio album at the time in those regions. A year after its release, UK Virgin Radio mocked the album's sales, stating: \"We've done something to improve Kylie's records: we've banned them.\" Several factors were named as reasons for the poor public perception: the lack of promotional activity, the three-year gap since her last album, the constant delays and title changes, and the change of musical direction. Minogue cited the incohesive material, as well as the long gap between albums, as the main reasons for the album's commercial failure, while Baker felt it was the lack of proper promotion and management on Deconstruction's end. Steve Anderson felt the release of \"Some Kind of Bliss\" as the lead single overshadowed Minogue's involvement on the track, and the album as a whole. Minogue said that after the single release, she had to \"keep telling people that this isn't an indie-guitar album. I'm not about to pick up a guitar and rock.\" James Dean Bradfield admitted he felt \"guilty\" that the single release had \"landed [Minogue] with a whole new set of problems\"."

        "content": "Impossible Princess gained four nominations at the 1998 ARIA Music Awards show, which was held in October. The album was nominated for Best Pop Release, Best Female Musician, and Album of the Year\u2014her first nomination in this category. She lost Album of the Year to Unit (1997) by Regurgitator, while losing Pop Release and Female Musician to Australian singer Natalie Imbruglia. The following year, Minogue was nominated for Best Female Artist for \"Cowboy Style\", which lost to Imbruglia's \"Wishing I Was There\" (1998). The music video for \"Did It Again\" won the 1998 International Viewer's Choice Award \u2013 MTV Australia. Because of pressure from the British press and public, Minogue contemplated retiring from the music industry for good. She decided instead to part with Deconstruction and BMG in November 1998. In 1999, Minogue signed to Parlophone and released her studio album Light Years in 2000 to a positive reception. The Guardians Tim Jonze believes that Light Years saved her career, while Louise Bruton of The Irish Times, said that Impossible Princess is \"potentially the low that she needed to reach the great heights of 2000's Light Years\". Minogue called Impossible Princess the most disappointing moment in her career. Minogue has commented that if she wrote another album of personal songs, she would consider it Impossible Princess part two, but vowed she would never do it again, feeling it would be \"equally critiqued\". Impossible Princess is widely considered Minogue's magnum opus, and music critics often recognised it as her most personal and experimental work to date. Cinquemani applauded Minogue's writing contribution to every track, which helps \"lending a starkly personal and unified cord that she wouldn't achieve again until 2018's Golden\". He picked it as Minogue's best album and added it to the staff choices of their Vital Pop: 50 Essential Pop Albums lists. Larrisa Dubecki, writing for The Age, felt the album was one of the key re-inventions of her career. Writers of Sputnikmusic praised Minogue's creativity and vocal performance, which made her \"a influential figure not only in pop music but whatever style she chooses\". They also described the album as Minogue's \"most artistic, diverse and adventurous album\" and a \"forgotten classic\". Several critics noticed the sonic and lyrical similarities between the album and Ray of Light (1998) by Madonna. Sputnikmusic viewed the album as \"the blueprint to Madonna's beloved album\" and \"Cowboy Style\" as \"the mother\" to \"Don't Tell Me\" (2000). Cinquemani wrote that both albums bear \"a striking resemblance\" to each other, as deeply personal and risky efforts by established pop artists. He observed that while Ray of Light saved Madonna \"from imminent irrelevance\", Impossible Princess brought a harsh reaction from the contemporary critics and public. Michael Paoletta of Billboard mentioned Impossible Princess is the most misunderstood album in her career. It has been included on several lists of the most underrated albums, by  publications such as Flavorwire, Slant Magazine and Faster Louder. On the 20th anniversary of the album, Ben Neutze of Daily Review wrote that, \"The Impossible Princess Kylie may never be what Minogue is remembered for, but it stands as the most intriguing chapter of her career, and the only significant glimpse at who this pop icon might be when stripped of the showgirl feathers, gold hot-pants, and other glorious facades.\" Caz Tran of ABC Online called it \"the creative detour [Minogue] needed to take\" in regard of her evolution and self-discovery."

        "content": "is an animated music video created by Studio Ghibli for the song \"On Your Mark\" by the Japanese rock duo Chage & Aska. The song was released in 1994 as part of the single \"Heart\". In 1995, Hayao Miyazaki wrote and directed the short film for the song as a side-project after having writer's block with Princess Mononoke. The anime music video is non-linear, providing multiple reiterations and alternate scenes to depict the events. The music video added sound effects to the audio track, but contains no dialogue. Miyazaki purposely misinterpreted the lyrics to present his vision of a world where the surface becomes inhospitable and humans live in an underground city. He made the video cryptic to evoke creative interpretations among viewers. The music video follows two policemen who raid and massacre a religious cult and find an angelic being, only to have her taken away and confined to a secure laboratory. Haunted by the fate of the \"angel\", the two men formulate a plan and break into the laboratory. Fleeing in an armored truck, the three plummet into an abyss after trying to force past a police aircraft along a narrow, suspended roadway. After a montage of the previous scenes, the armored truck suddenly rockets into an apartment complex, allowing their escape. The three escape to the surface, ignoring the radiation and danger signs, emerging near an encased nuclear reactor. The two men set the \"angel\" free and she flies off into the sky. The music video was well-received and praised for its animation and attention to detail. It premiered as a short before Studio Ghibli's Whisper of the Heart and has since been released on Laserdisc and DVD as part of the All Things Ghibli Special Short Short compilation."

        "content": "The video begins with shots of a vacant village, overgrown with weeds, and the concrete sarcophagus of a covered-over nuclear reactor in the background. As the music begins, the scene changes to a sci-fi-style nighttime military-style police raid on a cult. Futuristic flying troop transports crash through the windows of a tower topped by  gigantic neon-lit eyes and occupied by armed defenders. The policemen exchange gunfire and grenades with cultists whose hoods depict an enormous eye. As the victorious police begin to sort through the bodies of the cultists, two policemen find what appears to be a girl, lying unconscious, with large feathered wings on her back. The scene changes again, now to bright daylight and blue sky. Two men are driving an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider passo corto down an empty road. As one of the men helps the girl up, she spreads her wings and he holds her hands while she gains confidence. With a nudge she is airborne, but she seems hesitant and afraid as he lets go. The scene changes back to the discovery of the girl in the tower, and the identity of the two policemen is revealed to be the same from the previous sequence. They carefully carry her out and offer her something to drink. A team of scientists wearing radiation suits arrive and quickly take the girl away. The two men are haunted by the girl's fate and formulate a plan to rescue her. They break into the laboratory and free her from confinement, but the lab's alarms are triggered. The three escape in an armored truck and drive along a narrow suspended roadway over a domed city built in a crater. Police hovercraft are in pursuit, and one of them comes very low to the roadway to block the fugitives' truck. The roadway collapses when the protagonists try to force their way through, sending the truck plummeting. The winged girl refuses to let go of the hands of her rescuers, and the three fall into the abyss. A brief montage of previous shots follows: the discovery of the girl, the girl flying through a blue sky, the two men rescuing the girl from the laboratory and stealing the truck, the truck plummeting amidst the wreckage of the roadway. But this time, the truck fires stabilizing thrusters and makes a short flight into the side of an apartment building. After their escape, the three are riding an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider passo corto through a dark tunnel underneath signs which bear radiation symbols and read (in kanji) \"Beware Of Sunlight\" and \"Survival Not Guaranteed\". As they emerge into daylight, they drive past nuclear cooling towers and a sign which reads \"Extreme Danger\" and continue down the road. One of the men helps the girl up, she spreads her wings and gives them a grateful smile; he kisses her hand, and the other winks in farewell. Soon, she is drifting upward into the sky. Briefly, a major urban cityscape is seen beyond the trees. The car veers off the road and slows to a stop in the grass."

        "content": "The production of the music video began because Miyazaki was suffering from writer's block on Princess Mononoke and needed another project to distract him. Miyazaki wrote and directed the music video for \"On Your Mark\", although the song was previously released in 1994 as part of the single \"Heart\". Despite the popularity of the work, Toshio Suzuki told Helen McCarthy, the British author of numerous anime reference books, that Studio Ghibli had not given \"100 percent\" focus to the music video. In the production of the music video, Miyazaki experimented with using computer animation to supplement traditional hand drawn cell-animation. At the time Studio Ghibli did not have its own computer department and the work was outsourced to CG Production Company Links, under supervision of Hideki Nakano, Silicon Graphics, Softimage 3D, and Alias Research. Techniques learned in the experimentation for On Your Mark were later adopted for the creation of Princess Mononoke. Animation director was Masashi And\u014d. Long time Miyazaki collaborator Michiyo Yasuda was in charge of colour selection. Backgrounds were created by Kazuo Oga. Y\u014dji Takeshige made his debut as art director. There is no dialogue in the music video and the two policemen are loosely modeled after Chage and Aska."

        "title": "On Your Mark_Analysis",
        "content": "The deliberately non-linear, enigmatic and cryptic style of the music video was intended to stimulate the imaginations of its viewers and their interpretations of the music video.\" Miyazaki offered an interpretation of the angel as \"Hope\" and to protect hope could paradoxically mean \"to let it go where no-one can touch it\". Dani Cavallaro, an author of books related to anime, reflected on this by proposing that hope retains its purity and authenticity when it is ephemeral, evanescent and elusive. Hope may cause exertion and possibly pain, but denying hope is to deny the feasibility or and vision it provides. Miyazaki said that in the music video's setting, humans live in an underground city after the surface of the Earth has been contaminated with radiation, creating a sanctuary for nature. Miyazaki did not find this believable, though, as humanity would suffer on the surface instead. Miyazaki intentionally misinterpreted the lyrics to reflect upon the vision of a world filled with disease and radiation and people's reactions to that world. He implied the two policemen might not be able to return to their old life, but offered no reason as to why. Cavallaro noted that the lyrics of the song include \"ryuukou no kaze\", which translates to \"flu\" and is also an idiom for \"the flu of fashion.\" The author further interpreted it as \"I always feel the urge to make a fresh start\" suggesting this could be the \"bleak acceptance of the ideological and economic codes that mold our lives in accordance with the imperative of planned obsolescence, or as a hopeful embracing of the genuine prospects of renewal and change.\" Cavallaro suggested that despite the feminine appearance of the \"angel\", it could be of a \"preternatural order\", making gender or sex distinctions irrelevant. Miyazaki referred to the angelic creature as \"tori no hito\" or \"a bird's person\" which is the nickname of Nausica\u00e4 from his Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind manga and film. Cavallaro noted another visual correspondence to Only Yesterday with the oppressive urban environment and the freedom of open spaces. During their April 1999 lecture series on manga, anime and the works of Miyazaki at the University of Dallas, Pamela Gossin, Professor of Arts and Humanities, and guest instructor Marc Hairston, research scientist in the William B. Hanson Center for Space Sciences, discussed On Your Mark in their lecture, \"In the Coda On Your Mark and Nausicaa, and drew parallels to the Nausica\u00e4 story, its titular character and its conclusion. Gossin and Hairston interpreted the release of the winged girl at the end of the video as Miyazaki setting free his character in a manner reminiscent of William Shakespeare's symbolic liberation of his characters, through Prospero's release of his servant Ariel in his play The Tempest. The final volume of the Nausica\u00e4 manga was released in January 1995. Miyazaki started creating On Your Mark that same month. McCarthy highlighted similarities to different works and real life found throughout the film, remarking that the opening city sequence could be an homage to Akira or Blade Runner and the attack on the religious cult could be a reflection of the Aum Shinrikyo movement. Nausicaa.net stated the production occurred prior to the police raid following the Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March 1995. McCarthy also noted that the film's scientists' decontamination gear look like the hero of Porco Rosso and the rescue scene is reminiscent of Princess Leia in Star Wars. The encased or \"box\" structure in the film is an homage to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant which was entombed in concrete following the Chernobyl disaster. Miyazaki scholar  observed that the urban settings have a China Town style and resemble the cityscapes of Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell animated film adaptation, in production at the time. While Miyazaki has been non-committal about the nature of his winged entity in On your Mark, Kan\u014d noted that the manga , an unfinished collaborative effort by Oshii and Satoshi Kon, with its Angel Disease theme, was still serialized in Animage at the time Miyazaki was creating On Your Mark in 1995."

By this time, the band had picked up a sizeable fan base and every now and then a fan would bring along, with consent of the band, recording equipment to record a set. Most of the time, this would mean relatively simple hand-held recorders resulting in lo-fi mono audience recordings, as with this set and the live album Live at Max's Kansas City (1972) (1969: The Velvet Underground Live was the notable exception, using stereo soundboard recordings). Robert Quine, an avid Velvet Underground fan, used to travel to as many concerts as possible. He became friends with the band and they allowed him to record sets from the audience, occasionally asking for playbacks. Quine recorded many concerts, but as his original musicassette tapes began to wear out, he compiled four reels of what he considered the best material. These \"best-of\" reels were ultimately released in 2001 as the present The Quine Tapes set. The original musicassettes from which the reels were compiled no longer exist. Musically, The Quine Tapes finds the band in the same phase in their history as documented on 1969\u2014the two sets even share a performance of \"Rock and Roll\", recorded at the same concert by both Quine and the Matrix sound personnel. Quine's tapes, although lo-fi audience recordings, capture much more of the music's ambience, especially in the larger venues, such as Washington University in St. Louis. Additionally, The Quine Tapes contains songs that the band only rarely performed by this time, such as \"Sunday Morning\", \"Venus in Furs\" and \"The Black Angel's Death Song\", along with other obscurities such as \"Over You\", \"Ride into the Sun\", and \"Follow the Leader\", which had never even been bootlegged in its original form."

The album was lyrically inspired by the memberships of Bono, the Edge, and Larry Mullen Jr. in a Christian group called the \"Shalom Fellowship\", and consequently it contains spiritual and religious themes. Their involvement with Shalom Fellowship led them to question the relationship between the Christian faith and the \"rock and roll\" lifestyle, and threatened to break up the band. After completing the third leg of the Boy Tour in February 1981, U2 began to write new material for October, entering the recording studio in July 1981. Just as they did for their 1980 debut Boy the band recorded at Windmill Lane Studios with Lillywhite producing. The recording sessions were complicated by Bono's loss of a briefcase containing in-progress lyrics for the new songs, forcing a hurried, improvisational approach to completing the album on time. October was preceded by the lead single \"Fire\" in July 1981, while its second single \"Gloria\" coincided with its release. The album received mixed reviews and limited radio play. In 2008, a remastered edition of October was released."

        "content": "In February 1981 during their Boy Tour, U2 began to write new material. (\"Fire\" had already been recorded at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas while U2 took a break from the Boy Tour.) They wrote part of October during an extended sound check at First Avenue in Minneapolis. In March, on an otherwise successful American leg of the tour, the briefcase of lead vocalist Bono containing in-progress lyrics and musical ideas was lost backstage during a performance at a nightclub in Portland, Oregon. The band had limited time to write new music on tour and in July began a two-month recording session at Windmill Lane Studios largely unprepared, forcing Bono to quickly improvise lyrics. Steve Lillywhite, reprising his role as producer from U2's debut album Boy, called the sessions \"completely chaotic and mad\". Bono said of the recording process of October, \"I remember the pressure it was made under, I remember writing lyrics on the microphone, and at \u00a350 an hour, that's quite a pressure. Lillywhite was pacing up and down the studio... he coped really well. And the ironic thing about October is that there's a sort of peace about the album, even though it was recorded under that pressure. A lot of people found October hard to accept at first, I mean, I used the word 'rejoice' precisely because I knew people have a mental block against it. It's a powerful word, it's lovely to say. It's implying more than 'get up and dance, baby.' I think October goes into areas that most rock 'n' roll bands ignore. When I listen to the album, something like 'Tomorrow,' it actually moves me.\" The briefcase was eventually recovered in October 2004, and Bono greeted its return as \"an act of grace\". Whereas Lillywhite recorded Larry Mullen Jr.'s drums in the stairway of the reception area of Windmill Lane Studios for Boy, the producer moved the recording of the drums into the studio for October; Lillywhite later called it \"one of the things that didn't work so well\"."

        "content": "The record placed an emphasis on religion and spirituality, particularly in the songs \"Gloria\" (featuring a Latin chorus of \"Gloria, in te domine\"), \"With a Shout (Jerusalem)\", and \"Tomorrow\". About the album, Bono declared in 2005: \"Can you imagine your second album\u2014the difficult second album\u2014it's about God?\". The songs mainly refine U2's formula of riff-rockers with songs such as \"Gloria\" and \"Rejoice\", but the band also expanded its musical palette in a few ways. In particular, guitarist The Edge incorporates piano in songs such as \"I Fall Down\", \"Stranger In a Strange Land\", \"Scarlet\", and \"October\". \"Tomorrow\", a lament to Bono's mother, who died when he was young, features Uilleann pipes played by Vinnie Kilduff later of In Tua Nua. \"I Threw a Brick Through a Window\" was one of the band's first songs to highlight drummer Larry Mullen, Jr., while \"Gloria\" highlights bassist Adam Clayton as it features three styles of playing in one song (using a pick for the most part, playing with fingers during the slide guitar by The Edge, then a \"slap & pop\" solo towards the end). \"Is That All?\" borrows the riff from \"Cry\", an older song the band has used as an introduction to \"The Electric Co.\" live."

Both of the album's two singles preceded the album's release; \"Fire\" and \"Gloria\" were released as singles in July and October 1981, respectively. October was the start of U2's vision of the music video as an integral part of the band's creative work, as it was released during a time that MTV was first becoming as popular as radio. The video for \"Gloria\" was directed by Meiert Avis and shot in the Canal Basin in Dublin. In 2008, a remastered edition of the album was released, featuring remastered tracks, along with B-sides and rarities. Three different formats of the remaster were made available."

        "content": "Upon its release, October received more mixed reviews than its predecessor. Dave McCullough of Sounds praised the album and said: \"A kind of zenith pop then, no half measures. It all breathes fire, recovering too from the pair of standouts appearing at the start of each side \u2013 'Gloria' being possibly Their Finest Moment and 'Tomorrow', low and muted, gently oozing emotion\". McCullough concluded, \"This October will last forever\". Adam Sweeting of Melody Maker also wrote a favorable review, saying: \"Their whole musical sensibility is shaped by a strong emotional bond to their homeland and its traditions. It gives them a completely different frame of reference from most groups, and on 'October' it's given them the strength to assimilate a barrage of disorientation and to turn that into a cohesive body of music.\" In contrast, NME published a negative review, in which reviewer Barney Hoskyns noted the \"excessive plaintiveness of Bono's voice and the forced power of U2's sound\". He concluded: \"Obviously rock doesn't expire just because groups run out of ways to change it... U2, I guess, will continue to 'move' in live performance, but they will only move on the lightest surface. Their music does 'soar'... But then 'God' knows, there are other religions\". Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone praised the Edge for his powerful guitar playing, \"drenched in echo and glory\", but said Bono's vocals were negatively impacted by him taking himself too seriously and that his lyrics were silly and clich\u00e9d. Pareles acknowledged the band's attempts to vary their sound, but said \"none of the strategies works as well yet as their basic power-trio dynamics\". In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the band \"tries too hard to move forward\" on October, with Bono straining to make big statements and the music sounding \"too pompous\". Erlewine did highlight certain \"thoroughly impressive\" songs that \"marry the message, melody, and sound together\"."

The album was remastered and reissued on 29 March 2010 as a collector's edition CD/DVD set and in October 2010. It was also listed in the book 100 Best Australian Albums, alongside The Boatman's Call (1997), in the Top 30. Cave later said, \"It was a nightmare, that record. It is reflective of a group - particularly myself - who was just writing songs and there was no larger idea behind it. Sometimes some of the group was there, sometimes they weren't. I hear bad production and I hear bad performances as well.\" Cave later admitted that the album, \"was made at a difficult time in my life when things were spiralling out of control in a lot of areas.\" In 2012, the album was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia."

The song \"Ian Curtis\" was named after  the late lead singer of the UK group Joy Division. Another victim of suicide, Curtis hanged himself in his Macclesfield home in 1980. The song contains many Joy Division song references, most notably \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\". The song \"Dying in New Brunswick\" was written by Geoff Rickly about his girlfriend who moved to New Brunswick and was raped while she was there.

In a summary of the review for Sputnikmusic, 'DaveyBoy' claimed that \"Songwriting & musical potential is evident, but this debut is brought down by raw production and a short running time that contains too much filler, repetition & padding out.\" In an initial review for Punk News, 'layawayplan' felt that \"Some of the melodies seem ill-concieved, leaving me scratching my head, and a bit depressed. Lead singer Geoff doesn't seem to have fully developed the vocal talent he displays on Full Collapse. The amazing screamed backup vocals (the first thing about Thursday to catch my attention) are there, but again, aren't as good as they could be.\" However in a review for the 2015 expanded edition from the same website, that album received a much warmer reception with writer 'RENALDO69' stating that \"Waiting will always be the starting point for a movement and revolution in my life. It's quite a ride to take in the more vulnerable and exposed tracks in the expanded edition, and one heck of a nostalgic trip!\""

The band included Eric Clapton, Klaus Voormann, and drummer Alan White. The group flew from London, and had brief unamplified rehearsals on the plane before appearing on the stage to perform several songs; one of which, \"Cold Turkey\", was first performed live at the festival.

He initially approached Beatles band-mate George Harrison to play lead guitar, but Harrison declined, so Lennon turned to Eric Clapton, who had previously performed with Lennon in the one-off super group, the Dirty Mac. Bassist Klaus Voormann and drummer Alan White soon agreed to perform, along with their assistants, Anthony Fawcett, Terry Doran, and Jill and Dan Richter. Voormann was a long-time friend of Lennon, but White, who was a respected session musician in London but did not know Lennon personally, initially thought that someone was prank calling him and only believed that the real John Lennon was on the phone when he called a second time. The group was scheduled to fly to Toronto on 12 September, the day before the concert, but Lennon, Ono, and Clapton were late to arrive at the airport. Lennon had talked to Clapton's management, but Clapton himself did not yet know that Lennon had invited him to perform and was not even aware of the concert. Brower managed to reach Clapton personally and told him to contact Lennon and Ono, who were still in bed. Clapton said he got \"a phone call on the day we were to leave and he said that someone had asked him to do that concert and it was that night! So I had to make the airport in an hour.\" The group had two quick rehearsals before appearing on stage. One was during the transatlantic flight from London to Toronto, though they could not hear the music very well since they were playing unplugged electric instruments. They had another at the concert venue shortly before appearing on stage. Lennon later said that the group \"didn't know what to play\" since they had not previously performed together, and they eventually settled on a set list consisting of older rock and roll standards, three Lennon-penned Beatle and solo songs, and two longer experimental songs featuring Ono. Though preparations for the show were rushed and chaotic, Lennon later said that he gained the confidence to leave the Beatles during those few days. Lennon mentioned this to Clapton at the time, and upon returning to London, he privately told Beatles' manager Allen Klein."

        "content": "The group played eight songs to a crowd of 20,000 people. Before the start of the Plastic Ono Band's performance, they were introduced by Kim Fowley, and Lennon said to the crowd that the group were going to play only songs that they actually knew. They performed the Beatles' \"Yer Blues\", because Clapton had performed it with Lennon for The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, and his two solo songs, \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Cold Turkey\", the latter of which had its premiere at the festival. \"Cold Turkey\", presented as \"the newest song that John wrote\" by Ono, had Lennon reading the lyrics off a clip-board. Ono selected a song that was to be B-side of \"Cold Turkey,\" \"Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)\", which also had its premiere at the festival. Shortly before the band went into \"Don't Worry Kyoko\", Lennon announced that Ono was \"gonna do her thing all over you\". The band closed with an electric version of the Wedding Album track \"John John (Let's Hope for Peace)\", an extended experimental number consisting of her screaming the title repeatedly to the feedback of the electric guitars. Towards the end of Ono's performance, the audience began to boo and whistle, and the band departed the stage leaving their guitars and bass to resonate until Mal Evans turned off the amplifiers. With their stage remarks, Lennon and Ono linked their appearance there to their ongoing campaign for peace. Lennon went to Abbey Road Studios on 25 September 1969 to mix the album from their eight-track recordings. While at the session, Lennon finished the stereo master for the album, although he did go back on 20 October to re-do the \"Don't Worry Kyoko\" stereo master, removing the majority of Ono's vocals from his songs and Clapton's backing vocals. The album is technically a soundtrack recording, being part of the audio portion of the documentary film being made of the festival by D.A. Pennebaker, later released as Sweet Toronto. Lennon and Ono made a deal with Pennebaker to license their portion of the show for record, in exchange for rights to include their appearance. According to the Beatles Monthly, due to the adverse reaction to Ono's performance, Pennebaker removed the segments with Lennon and Ono after limited screenings of the film, later re-edited as Keep on Rockin'''. Showtime ultimately presented the performance in 1989, and the full movie appeared later on home video and DVD."

        "content": "The album, released on the same day in both the UK and US, failed to chart in the UK but peaked at number 10 in the US. It was released to quash any bootleg versions that Lennon was sure would leak onto the market. US editions of the album wrongly stated that the album was recorded in England. The album came with a 13-month calendar that had photos, poems and songs in it, from Lennon's 1964 book In His Own Write, his 1965 book A Spaniard in the Works, and Ono's 1964 book Grapefruit. In the US, Capitol was reluctant at first to issue the album, after the commercial failures of Lennon's and Ono's experimental albums. Lennon recalled in an interview in December 1980 that he had to persuade Capitol to distribute the album: \"They said 'This is garbage, we're not going to put it out with her screaming on one side and you doing this sort of live stuff.' And they refused to put it out. But we finally persuaded them that\u00a0... people might buy this.\" In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon said that Capitol \"were on the [Paul] McCartney bandwagon, which they were on, and they thought that I was just an idiot pissing about with a Japanese broad and the music we were making, like Toronto, they didn't want to put out, because they didn't like that.\" Criticism was directed at side two of the LP, the side consisting entirely of two Yoko Ono songs. Richard Ginell of AllMusic remarks: Lennon later said he \"couldn't remember any of the words but it didn't matter\u2014I just made them all up and we made a great wonderful noise.\" Carl Perkins said to Lennon after the show that he was \"so beautiful you made me cry.\" A bootleg album of the concert appeared, under the title JL-YO-EC, thanks to an audience recording, which was released about the same time as the official album. After Lennon's death, the album, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set, which was released in the UK on 15 June 1981. The album was reissued in the US in 1982, by Capitol, and again in 1986. The album was originally scheduled to appear on CD for the first time in June 1989, but the plan was scrapped. Ono, with the help of Rob Stevens from Quad Recording, supervised a remixing of Live Peace in Toronto 1969'' for its compact disc issue, released on 1 May 1995. Two of the remixed tracks feature a variation in Ono's vocals: while \"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\" has additional backing vocals from Ono, \"Money\" has fewer backing vocals from Ono. The CD booklet included a 1995 calendar, mimicking the original release. The album is also available from the audiophile label Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, utilizing the same remix. The booklet for the 2006 Mobile Fidelity release also included a current calendar."

Released in 1986, it is the second and last album in the American Composer series before its cancellation due to increasing difficulties in maintaining the project. The track \"Kaw-Liga\", later issued as a single, samples the rhythm and bassline of Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" (a reference to country singer Billie Jean Horton, who was married to Williams before his death) and did well in the emerging European club scene, spawning several remixes; it is as close as the Residents ever got to a bona fide commercial hit. The \"Sousaside\" features sound effects recorded by Philip Perkins to create the effect of a marching band on a happy occasion; a mix of \"Stars and Stripes Forever\" without sound effects was released as a B-side to the \"Kaw-Liga\" single. Stars & Hank Forever is also the last studio album to feature guitarist Snakefinger, before his early death in July 1987. The Williams song \"Six More Miles\" has since then become a sort of ceremonial number for the Residents, being performed in tribute to Snakefinger in 1987, and recently as an encore in 2018 in tribute to the death of Hardy Fox, one of the founding members of the group."

        "content": "During the first couple of weeks in the studio the band found it quite difficult to adapt from an 'indie'-oriented sound to a more commercially viable pop rock sound. Producer Lee offered constructive suggestions about how to both simplify their songs and augment them with other sounds such as strings, and Snow Patrol proved very receptive to his advice. According to Chancellor, \"Some bands tend to be more defensive about what goes on in the studio. Snow Patrol weren't. They were very much like, 'Yeah, we really want to be successful this time.'\" The lyrics, all written by Lightbody are about failing relationships and break-ups. They were inspired by his personal experiences. Quinn, his longtime friend, says that he knows who Lightbody sings about in those songs. The lyrics deal with the themes of relationships and politics. Lightbody has said that his \"finally learn[ing] to write a chorus\" was the key to the album's success. Guitarist Nathan Connolly joined the band during the recording sessions. He did not contribute much, as the whole album had already been demoed. He commented that he found it easy to start writing and sharing his ideas with the rest of the band, as he had a good relationship with the band before being a member. The album's music incorporates distorted guitar, feedback styles, and the vocals are gritty. The band's sound on the album was described as being a \"cross between the sullen folk of Nick Drake and the more punchy rock moments of Simple Minds and the Pixies. Reviewing the album, Pitchfork described the performances as being based around \"rigid, unwavering tempos that approximate dance music,\" created through looped sections of playing augmented with electronics. The first song, \"How to Be Dead\", introduces this sound with extensive use of drum machine programming."

Donna was still credited as a recurring character during the first season due to the uncertainty, but she appears in every episode of that season, and Janel Moloney was credited as a full cast member from the second season onward. During the first four seasons, Donna's relationship with Josh Lyman remains in stasis, with neither daring to make any real romantic move on the other. Aaron Sorkin admits that he was more inclined to move the relationship forward, but, every time he discussed the possibility, fellow executive producer Thomas Schlamme would shout, \"No!

Released on May 30, 1994, it is considered one of Nine Inch Nails' signature songs and remains their most popular song. Most versions of the single are titled \"Closer to God\", a rare example in music of a single's title differing from the title of its A-side (\"Closer to God\" is also the title of an alternate version of \"Closer\" featured on the single, which was also released as a separate promotional single for club-play). The single is the ninth official Nine Inch Nails release, making it \"Halo 9\" in the band's official Halo numbering system. A promotional single provided by the label to radio stations included both long and short vocal-censored (i.e. silenced profanity) versions. Although the song addresses themes such as self-hatred and obsession, its sexually aggressive chorus led to widespread misinterpretation of the song as an anthem of lust, which helped it become Nine Inch Nails' most successful single up to that time and cemented Trent Reznor's status as an industrial rock icon. Commercially, \"Closer\" reached  41 on the US Billboard Hot 100, No. 25 on the UK Singles Chart, and No. 3 on the Australian Singles Chart. Censored versions of the song and its Mark Romanek-directed music video received substantial airplay on radio and MTV."

        "content": "\"Closer\" has been described as industrial rock and alternative rock. \"Closer\" uses elements of funk,  and electronic music. The drum track of \"Closer\" is built around a heavily modified sample of the bass drum from the 1977 Iggy Pop song \"Nightclubbing\", which was performed by a Roland drum machine. The samples were produced using two Akai S1100 samplers, each with an expander, essentially making up four samplers. The samples were then combined with beats produced by a Roland R-70 drum machine. The production features sound effects such as a bass squelch, synth echo, and feedback growl. Radio edits of \"Closer\" were created by muting the vocal track for the duration of each deleted obscenity. Lyrically, \"Closer\" is a song about self-hatred and obsession; to Reznor's dismay, the song was widely misinterpreted as a lust anthem due to its chorus, which famously includes the lines \"I wanna fuck you like an animal / I wanna feel you from the inside\". In 2003, VH1 ranked the song at No. 93 in its countdown of the \"100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years.\" The song was ranked at No. 2 on AOL's \"69 Sexiest Songs of All Time\" due to the explicit frankness of the chorus.

        "content": "\"Closer\" had some radio airplay before it was released as a single. This factor increased within weeks, leading Interscope to release the song as a single in May 1994. When it premiered, the single charted on several US Billboard magazine music listings. Debuting near the bottom spot of the Billboard Hot 100, it barely missed the top 40, peaking at No. 41. It climbed to No. 11 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, and also went on to reach No. 35 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart and No. 29 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart. \"Closer\" was the band's first crossover hit and remains their most popular song to date. The single was successful in several other countries as well. It charted the highest in Australia, where it rose to No. 3 on the week of November 13, 1994, and was the country's 87th most successful single of 1994. Although \"Closer\" did not initially appear on Canada's official music chart during its original release, it reached a peak of No. 5 on the Canadian Singles Chart in February 2002. It also did not chart in Denmark until 2007, when it reached No. 12 in July. In the United Kingdom, the single reached No. 25. The aforementioned \"Closer to God\" version of the song charted at No. 29 on the Billboard Dance Music/Club Play Singles. The song was voted in at No. 62 on Triple J's Hottest 100 of all time in 2009, and ranked No. 42 on Pitchfork Media's \"Top 200 Tracks of the 90s\" in 2010."

The video was popular and helped bolster the success of the band. Set in what appears to be a 19th-century mad scientist's laboratory, the video's imagery involves religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror, including: A heart connected to some sort of device; the beat of the heart corresponds to the beat of the song"

Reznor wearing various fetish gear, such as an S&M mask, ball gag, and long leather gloves while swinging in shackles. Several times, Reznor, wearing leather pants, floats and rotates through the air, suspended by invisible wires. There are also scenes of Reznor being blown back by a wind machine while wearing aviator goggles. Mark has stated: These images were inspired by the work of Joel-Peter Witkin, as well as by the Brothers Quay's animated short film Street of Crocodiles. For the television version, certain removed scenes were replaced with a title card that read \"Scene Missing,\" and the instances of the word fuck being edited out were accompanied by a stop in the video motion, making it appear as if the stop was a result of defective film (this was supposedly done to make sure the flow of the song was not affected). According to Romanek, the video was filmed using \"a slightly out of date film stock but it was still a contemporary film stock.\" The unedited version of the video was shown on Playboy TV's music video show Hot Rocks in 1994. In mid-2002, the unedited version aired on MTV2 as part of a special countdown showcasing the most controversial videos ever to air on MTV. This countdown was only shown late at night due to the sexually explicit imagery of \"Closer\" and several other videos. In 2006, \"Closer\" was voted No. 1 in a VH1 Classic poll titled \"20 Greatest Music Videos of All Time.\" In retrospect, Reznor said of the video that \"The rarest of things occurred: where the song sounded better to me, seeing it with the video. And it's my song.\" The unedited video is included in Closure, The Downward Spiral (DualDisc), Directors Label Volume 4: The Work Of Director Mark Romanek and VEVO, and it is available for download from the United States iTunes Store under the band's page. Behind-the-scenes footage with commentary by Romanek is included in Closure (DVD) and Directors Label.

Thirty Seconds to Mars uses samples from \"Closer\" when they perform \"The Fantasy.\" Toronto-based Alternative R&B act The Weeknd samples \"Closer\" in the song \"House of Balloons/Glass Table Girls.\" \"Weird Al\" Yankovic has paid tribute to \"Closer\" twice: in \"The Alternative Polka\" on his album Bad Hair Day, a section of the song was used in which the word \"fuck\" is replaced with a cartoon sound effects. \"Germs\" on his Running with Scissors album is a style parody of several Nine Inch Nails songs. The Asylum Street Spankers occasionally perform a bluegrass version, available at the  Live Music Archive. In 1995, the Australian novelty act Nine Inch Richards covered the song under the title \"Closer To Hogs\".  Sung in a southern drawl, it combined Trent Reznor's sexually charged lyrics with barnyard animal samples, humorously implying that the song is about bestiality.  A video clip of the parody was taken at the Sydney Royal Easter Show.  This single peaked at No. 51 in Australia. In 2008, Sy Smith performed the song as part of her \"Conflict Tour\". In August 2010, Smith performed the song again at \"Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Heights Plaza\". In 2014, from the compilation album in the Punk Goes 90's 2 has been covered by British rock Asking Alexandria. In 2016, singer-songwriter Father John Misty covered the song live in Chicago during two separate performances. Fellow Interscope act Limp Bizkit parodied \"Closer\" (as well \"The Perfect Drug\" and \"Burn\") in their song \"Hot Dog\". The chorus goes, \"You wanna fuck me like an animal, You'd like to burn me on the inside, You like to think that I'm a perfect drug, Just know that nothing you do will bring you closer to me.\" Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said he was a big fan of Nine Inch Nails, who has additionally inspired his music."

James Delingpole in a January 1997 review in The Daily Telegraph wrote the band had produced a \"strange mix of Bowie-esque glam rock, school-of-Syd-Barrett psychedelia and DIY kitsch\", which resulted in a \"delightfully skewed\" album. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic later commented that on Fuzzy Logic, the band combined psychedelia and art rock with pop melodies in an \"intoxicating\" manner, and that despite not being fully cohesive as an album, \"the individual pleasures of each song become more apparent with each listen\". Fuzzy Logic was named the third best album of 1996 by Melody Maker and fourth best by NME.

Rod Stanley in the 2005 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die felt that the band would go on to record better albums, but that the inventiveness of the album's blend of \"Sixties pop, punk rock, and psychedelia, with an underlying Nineties dance sensibility\", made it both joyful and exciting. Reviewing the album in 2016, Uncuts John Lewis wrote that its \"quizzical\" lyrics and influences from \"1970s guilty pleasures\" set Super Furry Animals apart from their contemporaries in the 1990s Britpop scene.

The album peaked at number 20 on the Billboard 200. The album only spawned one single, \"A Life of Illusion\", which would become one of Walsh's most popular songs.

        "content": "\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\" is a topical song written by the American musician Bob Dylan. Recorded on October 23, 1963, the song was released on Dylan's 1964 album The Times They Are a-Changin' and gives a generally factual account of the killing of a 51-year-old African-American barmaid, Hattie Carroll (March 3, 1911 \u2013 February 9, 1963), by then 24-year-old William Devereux \"Billy\" Zantzinger (February 7, 1939 \u2013 January 3, 2009), a young man from a wealthy  white tobacco farming family in Charles County, Maryland, and of his subsequent sentence to six months in a county jail, after being convicted of assault. The melody is largely taken from a folk song called \u201dMary Hamilton\u201d. The lyrics are a commentary on 1960s racism. When Carroll was killed in 1963, Charles County was still strictly segregated by race in public facilities such as restaurants, churches, theaters, doctor's offices, buses and the county fair. The schools of Charles County were not integrated until 1967."

        "content": "The main incident described in the song took place in the early hours of February 9, 1963, at the white tie Spinsters' Ball at the Emerson Hotel in Baltimore. Using a toy cane, Zantzinger drunkenly assaulted at least three of the Emerson Hotel workers: a bellboy, a waitress, and \u2014 at about 1:30 in the morning of the 9th \u2014 Carroll, a 51-year-old barmaid. Carroll \"had borne 10 children\" (at least according to the song) and was president of a black social club. According to a 1991 story in The Washington Post, Carroll was the mother of nine children. Already drunk before he got to the Emerson Hotel that night, the 6'2\" Zantzinger had assaulted employees at Eager House, a prestigious Baltimore restaurant, with the same cane. The cane was a 25-cent toy. At the Spinsters' Ball, he called a 30-year-old waitress a \"nigger\" and hit her with the cane; she fled the room in tears. Moments later, after ordering a bourbon that Carroll did not bring immediately, Zantzinger cursed her, called her a \"nigger\", then \"you black son of a bitch\", and struck her on the shoulder and across the head with the cane. In the words of the court notes: \"He asked for a drink and called her 'a black bitch', and 'black s.o.b'. She replied, 'Just a moment' and started to prepare his drink. After a delay of perhaps a minute, he complained about her being slow and struck her a hard blow on her shoulder about half-way between the point of her shoulder and her neck.\" She handed him his drink. After striking Carroll, he attacked his own wife, knocking her to the ground and hitting her with his shoe. Within five minutes from the time of the blow, Carroll leaned heavily against the barmaid next to her and complained of feeling ill. Carroll told co-workers, \"I feel deathly ill, that man has upset me so.\" The barmaid and another employee helped Carroll to the kitchen. Her arm became numb, her speech thick. She collapsed and was hospitalized. Carroll died eight hours after the assault. Her autopsy showed hardened arteries, an enlarged heart and high blood pressure. A spinal tap confirmed brain hemorrhage as the cause of death. She died in Mercy Hospital at 9 a.m. on February 9, 1963. Zantzinger was initially charged with murder. His defense was that he had been extremely drunk, and he claimed to have no memory of the attack. His charge was reduced to manslaughter and assault, based on the likelihood that it was her stress reaction to his verbal and physical abuse that led to the intracranial bleeding, rather than blunt-force trauma from the blow that left no lasting mark. On August 28, Zantzinger was convicted of both charges and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. Time magazine covered the sentencing: After the sentence was announced, the New York Herald Tribune conjectured he was given a sentence that short to keep him out of the largely black state prison, reasoning his notoriety would make him a target for abuse there. Zantzinger served his time in the comparative safety of the Washington County county jail, some  from the scene of the crime. In September, the Herald Tribune quoted Zantzinger on his sentence: \"I'll just miss a lot of snow.\" His then-wife, Jane, was quoted saying, \"Nobody treats his niggers as well as Billy does around here.\""

        "content": "Zantzinger was convicted of manslaughter on August 28, 1963, and was not tried by a jury of peers but by a panel of three judges. The sentence was handed down on the same day that Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Bob Dylan, aged 22 at that time, was one of the celebrities at the march and on the journey home to New York City he read about the conviction of Zantzinger and decided to write a protest song about the case. According to a 1991 Washington Post report, Dylan wrote the song in Manhattan, sitting in an all-night cafe. A recent radio documentary on the song said rather that he wrote it both in New York and at the home of his then-lover, Joan Baez, in Carmel. According to Nancy Carlin, a friend of Baez who visited: \"He would stand in this cubbyhole, beautiful view across the hills, and peck type on an old typewriter... there was an old piano up at Joan's... and peck piano playing... up until noon he would drink black coffee then switch over to red wine, quit about five or six.\" He recorded it on October 23, 1963, when the trial was still relatively fresh news, and incorporated it into his live repertoire immediately, before releasing the studio version on January 13, 1964. The song juxtaposes Zantzinger's wealth and connections with the brevity of that sentence. Despite the song's topical nature, Dylan has continued to perform it in concert as of May 2009.  His live-audience renditions of it appear on the albums The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue (2002; recorded November 21, 1975), The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall (2004; recorded October 31, 1964), and Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections (2018; recorded October 26, 1963).  In 2019, five live performances of the song from the 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue tour were released on the box set The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings. In Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan includes \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\" in a list of his early songs which he feels were influenced by his introduction to the work of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. He describes writing out the words of \"Pirate Jenny\" (or \"The Black Freighter\") in order to understand how the Brecht\u2013Weill song achieved its effect. Dylan writes: \"Woody had never written a song like that. It wasn't a protest or a topical song and there was no love for people in it. I took the song apart and unzipped it\u2014it was the free verse association, the structure and disregard for the known certainty of melodic pattern to make it seriously matter, give it its cutting edge. It also had the ideal chorus for the lyrics.\" Literary critic Christopher Ricks considers the song to be \"one of Dylan's greatest\" and the recording on The Times They Are A-Changin' to be \"perfect\". He devotes an entire chapter to it, analyzing both the meaning as well as the prosody in his book on Dylan's songs as poetry. \"But here is a song that could not be written better.\" Dylan's song (\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\") contains at least two inaccuracies. Zantzinger was not booked for first degree murder, but for second degree murder. Dylan also misspells and mispronounces Zantzinger's surname as \"Zanzinger\"."

        "content": "After serving his sentence for manslaughter, Zantzinger returned to running the farm in Charles County and began selling real estate. He moved to more urban Waldorf, Maryland, still within Charles County. Eventually he moved to a  home in Port Tobacco, where he lived throughout the 1990s until moving to a new home in St. Mary's County around 2001 in Chaptico, Maryland, called Bachelor's Hope. In addition to federal tax delinquencies, Zantzinger fell more than $18,000 behind on county taxes on properties he owned in two Charles County communities called Patuxent Woods and Indian Head, shanties he leased to poor blacks. In 1986, the same year the IRS ruled against him, Charles County confiscated those properties. Nonetheless, Zantzinger continued to collect rents, raise rents, and even successfully prosecute his putative tenants for back rent. In June 1991, Zantzinger was initially charged with a single count of \"deceptive trade practices.\" After some delay, Zantzinger pleaded guilty to 50 misdemeanor counts of unfair and deceptive trade practices. He was sentenced to 19 months in prison and a $50,000 fine. Some of his prison sentence was served in a work release program. In 2001, Zantzinger discussed the song with Howard Sounes for Down the Highway, the Life of Bob Dylan. He dismissed the song as a \"total lie\" and claimed \"It's actually had no effect upon my life\", but expressed scorn for Dylan, saying, \"He's a no-account son of a bitch; he's just like a scum of a scum bag of the earth. I should have sued him and put him in jail.\" William \"Billy\" Zantzinger died in Charlotte Hall, Maryland, on January 3, 2009, at the age of 69."

It was produced to capitalize on the success of teen artists Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, who both debuted earlier that year.

It sold four million copies in total. Sweet Kisses spawned three singles, including Simpson's debut single \"I Wanna Love You Forever\", which is her biggest hit in the US. The second single was a duet: \"Where You Are\" with future husband Nick Lachey of 98 Degrees. The third single was the \"Jack and Diane\"-sampling dance track \"I Think I'm in Love With You\"."

        "content": "Simpson first developed and nurtured her talent in her local Baptist church, where her father also worked as the congregation's youth minister. At age twelve, she unsuccessfully auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club. While attending a church camp, at the age of 13, Simpson sang Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" and an arrangement of \"Amazing Grace\". One of the camp's visitors was launching a Gospel music record label and saw great promise and profits in her voice. It was during this time, while attending J. J. Pearce High School, Simpson signed to Proclaim Records, a minor Gospel music record label. She recorded an album, Jessica, but Proclaim went bankrupt and the album was never officially released except for a small pressing funded by her grandmother. This small pressing gained her minor attention which led her to performing at concerts with other gospel legendary acts such as Kirk Franklin, God's Property, and CeCe Winans. When she was seventeen years old, Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola heard Jessica, he was impressed with Simpson's musical talent and skill. Mottola instantly thought Simpson sounded like Mariah Carey. Simpson was immediately signed to the label. She dropped out of high school but later earned her GED. Simpson also collaborated with Sam Watters for the album. Watters produced the singles \"I Wanna Love You Forever\" and \"Where You Are\", as well as \"Heart of Innocence\". Watters also co-wrote the track \"I Wanna Love You Forever\", along with Louis Biancaniello. Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers also produced the tracks \"I've Got My Eyes On You\" and \"Betcha She Don't Love You\" together, though neither track was released as a single. Simpson's label wanted Sweet Kisses to be different from that of Aguilera's and Spears' debut albums, in that they were sexually risque, especially the lead singles from both albums. For Sweet Kisses, the label decided they wanted Simpson to be the \"anti-sex appeal\", to which Simpson would sing about love and romance rather than sexual themes. Simpson's \"virgin\" image was thought of as a great idea by the label, who felt that it would draw in listeners by making a girl whom they could relate to. Simpson also announced in an interview that she would be abstinent until marriage, which helped listeners give her the appearance the label was hoping for."

According to the sheet music book published by Hal Leonard Corporation in Musicnotes.com, \"I Wanna Love You Forever\" is a common time signature song, with a beat rate of 80 beats per minute.

The song became Simpson's highest-charting single in the United States, peaking at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Its commercial sales were particularly strong, and landed the single atop the Hot 100 Singles Sales for six weeks; this in turn earned the song a platinum certification. It was also a top ten hit in Canada. Worldwide, the single was successful, as it peaked within the top ten in most European nations and Australia, which reached the top ten in Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Belgium and Australia. \"Where You Are\" was released as the second single from the album. The single failed to reach even the top fifty of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at sixty-two. The song did, however, become a relative Adult Contemporary hit. Strangely enough though, dance fans reacted strongly to the physical single of the song and the song became a hit on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales reaching number four. Internationally, the song was not released in major music markets excluding Canada. \"I Think I'm In Love With You\" was the third and final single released from her debut album. It was more up tempo than Simpson's previous singles and became a moderate hit, reaching number twenty-one on the US Billboard Hot 100, largely on the strength of its radio airplay; it reached the top five on Billboard's Top 40 Mainstream and achieved success on the Adult Contemporary and Rhythmic Top 40 charts.

        "content": "The album received mostly mixed reviews. Allmusic gave the album three out of five stars, quoting, \"She delves into the frothy dance-pop that's teen pop's stock-in-trade, but the heart of her album lies in adult contemporary ballads like her breakout hit \"I Wanna Love You Forever,\" which gives her a chance to show off the richness of her voice. She doesn't over-sing, like Aguilera occasionally does, even if she has moments where she pushes the envelope slightly \u2014 just like her idol Dion. However, there are already indications that she's developing her own voice, since she is equally capable of delivering danceable urban R&B (\"Final Heartbreak,\" \"I've Got My Eyes on You,\" the Destiny's Child duet \"Woman in Me\") as she is mature balladry (\"Faith in Me,\" the Nick Lachey duet \"Where You Are\"). Like most teen-pop albums, Sweet Kisses suffers from inconsistent material, yet the filler is well-produced and performed, making the record every bit as listenable as Aguilera's fine debut.\" People Magazine was less critical of the album, quoting \"Blonde, pouty-lipped and impossibly cute, Jessica Simpson is as tough to pick out of a lineup of lookalike teenage songbirds as her breathless hit \"I Wanna Love You Forever\" is difficult to differentiate from the rest of Top 40 radio. So far, Simpson's debut album hasn't scored the same success as those of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. But rest assured there are more cookies like \"I Wanna\" in Simpson's cutter. One ditty, titled \"Where Are You,\" is a duet with 98\u00b0 boy-toy Nick Lachey, Simpson's real-life squeeze. Unlike her peers the 19-year-old Simpson is not a former member of Disney's Mickey Mouse Club. She auditioned for the show at age 12 but didn't make the cut. Also setting her apart from the teen pop pack is Simpson's track record as a performer on the Christian music circuit. Here, she sounds downright worldly singing \"Heart of Innocence\"\u2014a devotional tune she wrote extolling the virtues of premarital abstinence\u2014in a low, sexy croon. Bottom Line: Teen yearnings set to a watery R&B beat.\" Although Hot Sauce Reviews was critical of Simpson's oversinging, the review was overall positive of the album, writing that it has \"enough fine pop tunes to make it an enjoyable listen\" and concluded that \"everything about Sweet Kisses is well-crafted, radio friendly pop stuff that is worth a listen\", with the exception of \"Where You Are\". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised Sweet Kisses as a hopeful debut when comparing her next album negatively to it. Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C-, stating \"Jessica Simpson, a melodramatic 19, chirps cheeky Mariah Carey-isms on Sweet Kisses, a subpar portfolio, missing the soulful target almost every time. 'Do you wanna see the woman in me?/Let me show you,' she lasciviously hisses in one laughable instance, backed by a doo-wopping Destiny's Child. Uh, thanks, but no, kid. Been there, done that. Mom's waiting for you outside in the station wagon.\" Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice: \"Simpson is a blonde who got out of cheerleading early to prepare herself for whatever show business offered--game-show sidekick, R-rated remake of Debbie Does Dallas, bond trader seeking trophy wife. What she got was a John Cougar [Mellencamp] sample and the hard-earned ability to carry a tune. We know teenpop is rarely as vapid, prefab, and faux-wholesome as gatekeepers who've barely listened to it claim. So let's not tell them about this 'refreshing blend of pop, R&B and [note copywriter getting desperate] gospel-flavored sounds.'\""

        "content": "Initially, the album debuted at number sixty-five on the US Billboard 200, selling 65,000 copies in its first week, significantly lower than expected by Columbia Records, as the first single from the album was a hit, peaking at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100. The following week, Sweet Kisses had dropped to number seventy, and continuing down the following weeks. To boost record sales, the label released the second single \"Where You Are\", but could not reach the success of its predecessor \"I Wanna Love You Forever\". While Sweet Kisses was kept in the top sixty for several weeks, the label decided to make one last attempt to launch the third single from the album. \"I Think I'm in Love With You\" was released in May 2000, instantly became a hit on radio stations that helped to rise from posts and the album reached the peak of twenty-five in August 2000. In total, the album stayed on the chart for sixty-two weeks. The album was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA. The album has sold about 2 million copies in the United States. In territories outside of the United States, the album had a similar chart effect. In Canada, Sweet Kisses peaked at number thirty-four on the Canadian Albums Chart. The album stayed on the chart for 37 weeks. Later it was certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA; now Music Canada). In Europe, the album performed better on the charts, peaking at number four in Norway and was certified Gold for sales 15,000 copies in that territory. and number five in Switzerland and remains Simpson's only top five album in that territory. It also peaked at number fifty-five in Sweden. In Japan, the album debuted at number sixteen on the Oricon albums chart, making it her only album to date to chart within the top twenty in Japan. In the United Kingdom, where the singles were met with a great commercial performance, the album debuted at number thirty-six. This makes Sweet Kisses Simpson's highest-charting album in the United Kingdom, tied with her third studio album In This Skin (2003). In Australia, the album debuted at number fifty-two, surprising the label as the album had spawned two top ten hits in the country. In total, Sweet Kisses has sold four million copies worldwide."

Throughout the album, vocalist Miho Hatori's alternately sung, rapped, and whispered performances are backed by Yuka Honda's hip hop-inspired sound collages. New York writer Chris Norris described Hatori and Honda as avant-pop musicians who on Viva! La Woman \"weave found sounds, Muzak, and orchestral textures\" into \"atmospheric\" songs. In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, critic Rob Sheffield described the music as a mixture of hip hop, dub, lounge, and pop. The album's lyrics balance humorous themes in \"Beef Jerky\", \"Birthday Cake\", and \"Know Your Chicken\" with abstract, often emotional narrative-style wording in \"Apple\", \"Sugar Water\", and \"Artichoke\", as well as overall pop music fare in \"White Pepper Ice Cream\", \"Theme\", and \"Le Pain Perdu\". Several songs feature the group's well-known references to food, primarily present on this release. Honda explained: \"Food is something you can't escape. It's there every day.\" The band would often go to restaurants after rehearsals, and according to Honda, \"Cibo Matto grew out of those restaurant times.\" \"Theme\", unusual among Cibo Matto's discography for its length, is a track which features a relatively normal song sung in English with several Italian words before shifting into instrumental passages and leading into a second half that contains entire verses in Japanese and French."

La Woman \"an ambitious confection of trickling beats and delicately comatose spoken vocals whose only hint of wackiness is the lyrics\", while AllMusic's Heather Phares praised it as \"innovative and catchy\" and \"diverse and entertaining\". Spin named Viva! La Woman the tenth best album of 1996 and later ranked it as the 90th best album of the 1990s. The album spent six weeks at number one on CMJ's college radio charts. Some listeners perceived the album as a novelty, \"partly because of the cutesy-pie assumptions attached to Asian women in pop and partly because of the band's propensity for writing songs about food\", much to Cibo Matto's chagrin. Writing in The Quietus in 2014, Joe Sweeney regarded Viva! La Woman as \"a food-obsessed avant-rap record that dared to be ridiculous at a time when full-throated earnestness... was shipping millions.\""

It largely turned its back on the quirky new wave pop that Siberry had been known for; in its place was a surreal amalgam of progressive rock and Laurie Anderson-style performance art narratives, only one of which was shorter than six minutes. Toronto progressive radio station CFNY, an early champion of Siberry's music, announced that it did not view any track on The Walking as viable for airplay on their station. Sales of the album were slow at first, although they improved when Siberry provided radio stations with a shorter edit of \"Ingrid and the Footman\". With the benefit of passing time, the Allmusic review by Sean Carruthers does a little bit of belated justice to the caliber of composition and performance of this recording: \"It's her most accomplished work to date, but it's bound to lose the casual listener quickly.\""

Several of the McGarrigle sisters' friends and collaborators, including Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt, Chaim Tannenbaum, Joel Zifkin and Philippe Tatartcheff, also appear on the album. The combo perform a mix of traditional folk tunes, pop standards and original material by the participants. Two of the songs, \"Gentle Annie\" and \"Skip Rope Song\", were recorded separately with  Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris in Tucson, Arizona. The sisters had been invited down to Arizona in order to participate on Harris and Ronstadt's 1999 album 'Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions'. Kate & Anna accepted the offer to feature on the album, but asked Harris and Ronstadt feature on their next album in exchange. Harris later also recorded several songs for the album during the normal recording sessions in Montreal. A DVD of a live show featured most of The McGarrigle Hour was released a year after the album. Some of the songs were accompanied by video interviews of Kate & Anna McGarrigle discussing the songs. The DVD also contained two 'Music Videos' of the songs recorded in Tucson - neither Harris nor Ronstadt were present at the live show - and a handful of songs from a 1980 concert at Teatro Expo in Montreal. The album won the Juno Award for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year - Group at the Juno Awards of 1999."

        "content": "Dusty in Memphis is the fifth studio album by English singer Dusty Springfield. Initial sessions were recorded at American Sound Studio in Memphis, while Springfield's final vocals and the album's orchestral parts were recorded at Atlantic Records' New York City studios. The album was released on 18 January 1969 in the United States by Atlantic Records, and Philips Records distributed the record outside the U.S. Springfield worked on the album with a team of musicians and producers that included Jerry Wexler, Arif Mardin, Tom Dowd, conductor Gene Orloff, backing vocalists the Sweet Inspirations, bassist Tommy Cogbill, and guitarist Reggie Young. Dusty in Memphis sold poorly upon its initial release, despite featuring one of Springfield's top-10 UK hits, \"Son of a Preacher Man\". It has since been generally acclaimed as her best work and one of the greatest albums of all time. Music critic Robert Christgau called it \"the all-time rock-era torch record\" and included it in his \"Basic Record Library\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). In 2001, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2020, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In its official press release, the library stated that despite its modest sales when first released, \"over time, Dusty in Memphis grew in stature to become widely recognized as an important album by a woman in the rock era.\""

        "content": "Hoping to reinvigorate her career and boost her credibility, Springfield signed with Atlantic Records, at the time the label of one of her soul music idols, Aretha Franklin. Springfield signed with Atlantic on the condition that she work with the label's chief producer and co-owner Jerry Wexler. For their initial album project, Wexler provided Springfield with dozens of song demo recordings, and the two decided on a program of 11 songs, primarily in the pop genre. Eight of the songs were composed by New York and Los Angeles-based songwriters who at the time were associated with the \"Brill Building Sound\". However, the album's best-known track, \"Son of a Preacher Man\", was not among these, and was originally written with the idea of submitting it to Aretha Franklin. (Franklin cut her own version of the song in 1969 after Springfield's single reached the #10 position in the Billboard Hot 100.) \"Preacher Man\" was musically and thematically closer to classic Southern soul, as was another of the album's cuts, \"Breakfast in Bed\". Farthest from the soul genre on the album was Michel Legrand's \"The Windmills of Your Mind\", which Springfield resisted and Wexler insisted upon. Wexler and Springfield's idea for the album was to record the pop compositions with Southern soul's rhythmic feel, a combination that other producers had tried successfully at American Sound Studios with acts like The Box Tops and Merrilee Rush. The Memphis sessions were supervised by Wexler, fellow Atlantic producer Arif Mardin, and Atlantic engineer Tom Dowd. Performing with Springfield were back-up singers the Sweet Inspirations and members of an informal group of American Sound Studios studio musicians known as the Memphis Boys, which included guitarist Reggie Young and bassist Tommy Cogbill. In addition to their pop session work, The Memphis Boys had previously backed soul musicians Wilson Pickett, Joe Tex, Bobby Womack, and King Curtis. Recording engineer Terry Manning, who was hired on assignment to write a piece on the sessions for the New Musical Express, attended and ended up assisting Dowd, along with Ed Kollis. The songs were written by, among others, Gerry Goffin and Carole King, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, Randy Newman, and Burt Bacharach and Hal David. The recording was a challenge for Wexler. In his book Rhythm and the Blues, Wexler wrote that out of all the songs that were initially submitted to Springfield for consideration, \"she approved exactly zero.\" For her, he continued, \"to say yes to one song was seen as a lifetime commitment.\" Springfield disputed this, saying she did choose two: \"Son of a Preacher Man\" and \"Just a Little Lovin'\". He was surprised, given Dusty's talent, by her apparent insecurity. Springfield later attributed her initial unease to a very real anxiety about being compared with the soul greats who had recorded in the same studios. Eventually Dusty's final vocals were recorded in New York. Additionally, Springfield stated that she had never before worked with just a rhythm track, and that it was the first time she had worked with outside producers, having self-produced her previous recordings (something for which she never took credit). During the Memphis sessions in November 1968, Springfield suggested to the heads of Atlantic Records that they should sign the newly formed Led Zeppelin group. She knew the band's bass player John Paul Jones, who had backed her in concerts before. Without having ever seen them and largely on Dusty's advice, the record company signed the group with a $143,000 advance."

        "content": "Dusty in Memphis was released by Atlantic Records on 18 January 1969 in the United States and on 18 April by Philips Records in the United Kingdom. The album was a commercial failure in both countries, only reaching number 99 on the American album charts and failing to chart altogether on the British Top 40. According to music journalist Peter Robinson, its failure stalled Springfield's career rather than revive it, although the record eventually became \"a popcultural milestone [and] timeless emotional reference point\" for listeners who discovered it in second-hand shops or purchased one of its several reissues years later. Robert Christgau called it \"a pop standard and classic\", predicting in his 1973 column for Newsday it would be \"the kind of record that will sell for years because its admirers need replacement copies, and it is the perfect instance of how a production team should work.\" Greil Marcus was less enthusiastic in Rolling Stone, deeming some of the songwriting inconsistent on what was \"a real drifting, cool, smart, sexually distracted soul album\". Despite modest sales, it was the first of a small wave of \"in Memphis\"-style albums that were recorded by pop singers at American Recording Studios. Three months after Springfield's album was released, Dionne Warwick's Soulful album was released, which had a similar mix of soul and pop and was recorded at American. In the summer of 1969, Elvis Presley's From Elvis in Memphis was released, featuring Presley recording at American with The Memphis Boys musicians. The following year, Petula Clark's Memphis album, also recorded at American, was released. These albums were all part of a larger 1960s and 1970s boom of soul and pop music production in Memphis (home to Stax Records, Hi Records, and other studios and labels), and nearby Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Dusty in Memphis has frequently been named one of the greatest albums of all-time; according to Acclaimed Music, it is the 98th most prominently ranked record on critics' all-time lists. NME named it the 54th greatest album ever in their 1993 list, and it was voted number 171 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked the record 89th on the magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, a rating which the album maintained in a 2012 revised list, before rising to number 83 in a 2020 reboot of the list. According to Richie Unterberger of AllMusic, the album's reputation has improved significantly over time as the music is \"deserving of its classic status\". Tony Scherman from Entertainment Weekly said Dusty in Memphis is a \"pure gem\", Springfield's greatest work, and perhaps one of the greatest pop records ever recorded. Q took note of its balance between \"R&B and sensitive pop dramas\", while Spin critic Chuck Eddy viewed it as one of the all-important blue-eyed soul records. In The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps wrote that Springfield and her team of musicians and producers for Dusty in Memphis developed an elegant and distinct fusion of pop and R&B that predated the Philadelphia soul sound of the 1970s. According to Eric Klinger from PopMatters, its sophisticated style of music influenced the sound of 1990s trip hop artists who sampled songs from the album and became a blueprint for British female singers of the 2000s, including Adele, Amy Winehouse, Duffy, Joss Stone, Paloma Faith and Rumer."

        "content": "\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" is a song recorded by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler. It was written and produced by Jim Steinman, and released on Tyler's fifth studio album, Faster Than the Speed of Night (1983). The song was released as a single by CBS/Columbia in 1983. The song became Tyler's biggest career hit, topping the UK Singles Chart, and becoming the fifth-best-selling single in 1983 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the single spent four weeks at the top of the charts, keeping another Steinman penned song \"Making Love Out of Nothing at All\" by Air Supply from reaching the top spot (a song Tyler would later cover in 1995), and it was Billboards number-six song of the year for 1983. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Worldwide, the single has sales in excess of 6 million copies and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 1 million copies after its release, updated to platinum in 2001 when the certification threshold changed. In 2015, the song was voted by the British public as the nation's third favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV."

        "content": "After her contract with RCA Records ended in 1981, Tyler found a new manager in David Aspden and after seeing Meat Loaf perform \"Bat Out of Hell\" live on The Old Grey Whistle Test, approached Meat Loaf's producer Jim Steinman and asked him to be her producer. Tyler aimed to create an album utilizing the Wall of Sound production techniques of Phil Spector, and she believed that Steinman was the only person that could create the same sound as Spector had mostly retired from the music business. Tyler visited Steinman in his apartment in New York in April 1982 with her manager, where she was presented with two tracks: \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\" and \"Goin' Through the Motions\". She stated that had she not liked the songs Steinman played for her, he would have rejected Tyler's invitation to collaborate. She returned to his studio apartment weeks later, where Steinman and Rory Dodd performed \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" for her. Steinman also hand-picked the recording band for the song, which included Dodd as a featured vocalist (the \"Turn around...\"  refrain). The lyric \"Turn around, bright eyes\" had originally appeared in Steinman's 1969 college musical The Dream Engine. Steinman had originally written the song's verse melody for his score to the 1980 film A Small Circle of Friends. \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" had to be shortened for radio play. Tyler did not believe that the song was radio-friendly at its full length; the song was reduced from seven minutes and two seconds to four minutes and thirty seconds. The power ballad became Tyler's highest-charting song in several countries; peaking at No. 1 in the United States, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom. At its peak, it sold 60,000 copies per day and approximately 6 million copies in total. It won the Variety Club award in the UK for best single of 1983. The song also made number 82 of VH1's top 100 love songs. Tyler told Record Mirror that she thought the song was about \"someone who wants to love so badly she's lying there in complete darkness.\" Steinman said in an interview with Playbill, about the inclusion of the song in his 1997 musical Dance of the Vampires:with 'Total Eclipse of the Heart', I was trying to come up with a love song and I remembered I actually wrote that to be a vampire love song. Its original title was 'Vampires in Love' because I was working on a musical of Nosferatu, the other great vampire story. If anyone listens to the lyrics, they're really like vampire lines. It's all about the darkness, the power of darkness and love's place in the dark...He also told People magazine that he thought Tyler sounded like John Fogerty, and wrote the song \"to be a showpiece for her voice.\" Tyler described the song as \"a challenge [to sing],\" stating that she \"[doesn't] like songs that anybody can sing. I like songs that need a lot of energy.\" After Steinman presented her with the song she told The Times, \"I just had shivers right up my spine...I couldn't wait to actually get in and record it.\" According to Meat Loaf, Steinman had written the song, along with \"Making Love Out of Nothing at All\", for Meat Loaf's album Midnight at the Lost and Found; however, Meat Loaf's record company refused to pay Steinman and he wrote separate songs himself. \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" was given to Bonnie Tyler and \"Making Love Out of Nothing at All\" to Air Supply. Tyler has denied this claim. \"Meat Loaf was apparently very annoyed that Jim gave that to me,\" Tyler stated. \"But Jim said he didn't write it for Meat Loaf, that he only finished it after meeting me.\" Steinman said to 'People' magazine that he considered it \"an aria to me, a wagnerian-like onslaught of sound and emotion. I wrote it to be a showpiece for her voice.\" In an interview with journalist Mick Wall shortly after the release of Meat Loaf's 2006 album Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose, Steinman stated: \"I didn't write [Total Eclipse of the Heart] for anyone but Bonnie.\" Steinman believed that CBS were expecting him to write something similar to \"It's a Heartache\", but he had different ideas."

The video features Bonnie Tyler clad in white, dreaming or fantasizing about her students in a boys' boarding school. Young men are seen dancing and participating in various school activities and singing in a choir. The video received two nominations at the Billboard Video Music Awards in 1983 for Best Performance by a Female and Most Effective Use of Symbolism.

I always listen to things because you never know!\" Tyler was impressed by the demo recording, and asked to sing the song live with her to ensure that her voice was strong enough and not reliant on studio editing. Tyler flew to Paris and recorded the song with Antonn in just a couple of hours. Their demo recording was sent to various French radio stations. She explained to BBC News that the single was released three weeks earlier than planned  \"after people heard it on the radio and went into the shops trying to buy it.\" \"Si demain... (Turn Around)\" was released in France on 19 December 2003, and a few weeks later in Belgium and Switzerland, and later included on her 2004 album Simply Believe and Antonn's self-titled solo album as well as several 2004 compilation albums such as Le Meilleur des Voix, NRJ Hit Music Only, Fan 2, Girls 2004, and Duets. After the unexpected success of the single, Antonn and Tyler decided to release another duet that they recorded; \"Si tout s'arr\u00eate (It's a Heartache)\" was released on 7 June 2004 but did not have the same success and peaked at number 12 on the week of its debut on the French SNEP Singles Chart.

He added that \"although it was treated like a novelty at first, the version was as effective as the original and was a deserved success.\" Larry Flick from Billboard stated that the singer \"does a fair imitation of Bonnie Tyler on this bouncy hi-NRG/disco interpretation of the bombastic power ballad. U.K. and European punters already have warmly embraced this twirler, and odds are an even 50-50 for similar success here.\" BuzzFeed ranked French's version number 26 in their \"The 101 Greatest Dance Songs of the '90s\" list in 2017. Robbie Daw from Idolator described it as a \"simmering dance rendition\". Music writer James Masterton wrote in his weekly UK chart commentary, that it \"suffers from the inevitable dance beat tacked on and also the lack of Jim Steinman's bombastic production that made the track such an epic in the first place.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media commented that \"away is the sandpaper vocal of Bonny Tyler, the edge now comes from the dance context put into the ballad. Needless to say it's an upbeat song anno 1995. Top 10 in the UK.\""

        "content": "The Get Up Kids released their third album On a Wire in May 2002 through independent label Vagrant Records. The album marked a musical shift away from their earlier work; despite being critically lauded, fan reaction to it was highly negative. While touring the album, the material came across as too mellow and quiet, which made for lackluster live performances, according to vocalist/guitarist Matt Pryor. In August, the group went on a European tour, playing shows in Germany, Belgium and the UK. The tour was to include additional shows in Italy, Switzerland and Amsterdam, but were left out due to time constraints. They were also due to perform shows as part of a Vagrant Records tour in the US, as well as further European shows, but were abandoned due to scheduling conflicts, resulting in the band staying at home. They began writing material for a new album, and by October, accumulated 12 potential song ideas. Around this time, they were in the middle of acquiring the studio Red House Recordings in Eudora, Kansas. The band had previously made albums in places such as Chicago, Los Angeles and Bridgeport, and wanted to make one near to their home. The opportunity to purchase Red House came about when they wanted to work more with Ed Rose, who they had known for several years, and asked the owner if he wanted to sell it. To help fund the purchase, the group sold their Heroes & Villains Records imprint to Vagrant Records, citing a lack of responsibility and interest in it, in addition to Vagrant wanting 100% ownership of its releases. During some midwestern US shows in November and December, and Canadian shows in March, the band debuted two new songs: \"Wouldn't Believe It\" and \"Sick in Her Skin\". In December, the band and Rose had ownership of Red House, which they renamed Black Lodge Studios. Following this, they began renovating it into a state-of-the-art studio. During this time, the band were in the process of demoing material."

        "content": "Guilt Show was recorded at Black Lodge Studios with Rose as the producer, in addition to acting as engineer. Despite having worked with the band for the previous six years, it  marked the first time he produced an album for them. The group began doing pre-production in April 2003, listening to around 20 demos at drummer Ryan Pope's house. By the end of the month, they had tracked scratch guitar and vocals for 13 songs. The process consisted of Pryor playing to a click track, Rose and Pope would build drum tracks over. By early May, the drums were recorded for 13 songs, with guitar, bass and vocals only being finished for a few of them. Around this time, Jason Russell of Hot Rod Circuit was in the city to practice with Pryor's other band the New Amsterdams, and ended up singing on \"Man of Conviction\", the only track finished up to that point. The group took a short two week break as most of the members went on holiday. They began tracking again in early June, and continued into July. They worked on some new songs, alongside a few by guitarist Jim Suptic. The members initially listened to the demos of these new songs and thought how to approach them, before playing them in the studio's live room as a full group, marking it one of a handful of times the whole band were in the studio together for the album. At the end of June, keyboardist James Dewees tracked his parts; he had little time to do this due to his project Reggie and the Full Effect was due to start touring in early July. Overall, Dewees finished around 95% of his parts before embarking on tour. Suptic laid down his guitar parts in August while both the New Amsterdams and Reggie were on tour. Pryor later recorded piano, for \"The Dark Night of the Soul\", and backing vocals, for \"Holy Roman\", at his home in Lawrence, Kansas. Pryor and Rob Pope recorded a drum machine and vocals for \"Is There a Way Out\" in the basement of Pope's house. Rob and Ryan Pope recorded bar noise for \"Martyr Me\" at The Free State Brewery. Jeremy Goldstein, who worked at Quadrant 5 Studios, did sound manipulation on \"The Dark Night of the Soul\". Recording wrapped up in October with 58 days in total spent recording; 18 songs had been tracked altogether. Shortly afterwards, Rose mixed the recordings. After the track sequence was approved by Vagrant Records, it was sent off for mastering by Mike Fossenkemper at Turtle Tone Studios in October and November."

        "content": "During much of the writing, Suptic was on his honeymoon, and Dewees was far less involved in the initial writing process. However, this gave brothers Rob and Ryan Pope a more substantial role in writing the album than they had previously had. The album was far less collaborative than their previous works, many songs being written and demoed by Pryor, then fleshed out by the rest of the band. During the writing, the group was listening to the Clash and Elvis Costello and the Attractions. They wanted more upbeat songs that would work well live, citing a return to the sound of Something to Write Home About (1999). Pryor was at the happiest point of his life up to that point, but thought that it would not work well lyrical and started writing about other people's relationships. He claimed there was \"hardly\" anything on the album relating to his life. He stated that Pope's divorce was \"pretty heavy shit to have gone through. So yeah, it made for good lyrical fodder.\" Pope said the theme and overall tone of the songs changed following it: \"It made everyone step back and go, 'Wow. Okay.' It\u2019s a big thing.\" Additionally, a lot of the album talks about conflict between friends. The album's title stemmed from an occasion where Rob Pope and Rose were driving to the studio. They passed a church that said \"annual quilt show\", which the pair misread as \"annual guilt show\". Discussing the meaning, Pryor said there was a lot of lyrics referring to \"betrayal in one form or another, and guilt seems to go hand-in-hand with betrayal.\" \"The One You Want\" is about a woman that Pryor wishes he never met: \"She sucks the soul out of people, and she spends all of my friend's money on drugs and stupid sh--.\" He referred to it as \"'77 era\" power pop. \"Wouldn't Believe\" is about an occurrence of adultery that eventually ends in divorce. Pryor found \"Holy Roman\" to be a departure from his usual writings due to its political nature. It was influenced by him becoming a father, stating his awareness of the political climate in the world outside of life in a band. \"How Long Is Too Long\" talks about a man who sleeps with another guy's partner. The track was the first of two written during the On a Wire sessions, but were left off as they didn't fit the style of that record. \"Sympathy\", the second track written during the On a Wire sessions, has been referred to by Pryor as \"'97 era\" indie rock. Pryor compared the drums on \"Conversation\" to Led Zeppelin."

On November 11, the album was announced for release in March 2004. In early January, the album's artwork was posted on Vagrant Records' website. It was made by Sean T; Pryor found it to much simpler than the \"incredibly complicated\" artwork of On a Wire. He thought the inside layout, which consists of a photo by Dan Monick, was reminiscent of Twin Peaks. Also during January, the band were due to release an EP of two songs from the forthcoming album alongside alternative versions of other songs, but was cancelled when it was decided that the band would be better off releasing the songs online. \"Martyr Me\" was posted online as a free download on January 12, followed by \"Wouldn't Believe It\" on January 19. The EP was later superseded by the Japan-exclusive \"Wouldn't Believe It\" single, released on January 21. It featured \"Martyr Me\", \"Wouldn't Believe It\", and acoustic versions of \"I'll Catch You\" and \"Wish You Were Here\". The group had planned to release the rest of the album's songs on a weekly basis, but due to the record leaking, the remainder of it was posted online on January 19. In addition, a music video for \"Man of Conviction\" was released on the same day. It featured photos of the band on tour, in the studio, among others. Guilt Show was released on March 2 through Vagrant Records. The CD included a link to a private website that features pictures, information on the creation of the songs, as well as demos. To promote its release, the band did four in-store performances, and appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and IMX. On March 25, the iTunes Session EP was released exclusively through the iTunes Store and featured softer, acoustic versions of some of the album's songs. In March and April, the group went on a headlining US tour with support from Recover and Rocky Votolato. On April 29, a music video for \"The One You Want\" was posted on Vagrant's website. It was filmed during a weekend in Cincinnati, Ohio and sees the group performing in a diner with 60 people dancing around them. In May and June, the band supported Dashboard Confessional and Thrice on the Honda Civic Tour. Following this, the group played shows in Japan, the UK and Canada. The group tried to get as much promotion for the album as they could before August, by which point Pryor had his second child, and the band went on a break to focus on other projects."

        "content": "The project began in 1988. At that time vocalist Jon Anderson had felt artistically constrained within Yes's current format, where the songwriting of Trevor Rabin had taken the band in a commercially very successful but musically and lyrically different direction. Anderson regrouped with Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman and Bill Bruford. Bruford, who had at various times been a member of King Crimson, recruited his Crimson bandmate Tony Levin as their bassist. The group was unable to use the name Yes for legal reasons. However, the group did have Arista assign the catalog number of 90126 to the original releases of the CD and cassette. This was a subtle way of stamping this as the next Yes album after 90125 (1983). Pre-production recording took place at La Frette Studios near Paris with Anderson putting down an outline of much of the album's songs with guitarist Milton McDonald. Anderson notably built on several demos provided by Howe, some of which Howe released on his solo album Homebrew (1996) and subsequent releases. Recording then relocated at AIR Studios on the island of Montserrat with Wakeman, Bruford and Levin. Most of the album was recorded using C-Lab's Notator software. Howe recorded his guitar parts separately at SARM West Studios in London. Mixing took place at Bearsville Studios in Bearsville, New York. Howe wrote in 2021 that Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero, who supervised the mixing along with Anderson, were while very in demand at the time unfamiliar with the Yes sound and how the band had balanced its instruments in mixes over the years. Some songs appeared to him to have been pieced together at that stage of post-production, as writing credits did not reflect the actual input. Howe says that while \"Themes\", the opening track, credits him as one of the writers, he had nothing to do with it, and conversely other members share credit on compositions that were largely his."

Much of the cover depicts real landscapes and formations in the US; the clay pinnacles in the foreground are in Bryce Canyon, Utah and the background hills are based on the Vermilion Cliffs by the Colorado River.

Its music video was directed by Storm Thorgerson. Paul Stump's 1997 History of Progressive Rock commented, \"The album was calculated to appeal to diehards; sweeping orchestral bridges, episodic songs, multitudinous solos. But this, as did the 90125 project, lacks momentum, the emotional syntax of the music is still boringly rock-based; the orchestration, once pearly and luminous, sounds merely stodgy, and technology remains under-utilized; even Horn's primitive samplings of 1983 are absent here.\""

It was also nominated for a 2003 Broadcast Film Critics Association Award, and a 2004 World Soundtrack Award. Heather Phares of Allmusic said, \"Though Burton's quirky, eerie aesthetic would normally be at odds with Pearl Jam's earnestness, the two work well together here, with the song touching on the film's warmth and adding a bit of earthiness to its daydreamy nature.\" Barry Walters of Rolling Stone said that \"the star is the film's end-titles' closer, Pearl Jam's \"Man of the Hour\", which captures the darkness of Big Fishs central Oedipal conflict.\" In the director's commentary for the DVD release of Big Fish, director Tim Burton raves about the song, calling it \"beautiful\" and \"so right\" and noting how well it \"matched and mirrored\" the film."

Live performances of \"Man of the Hour\" can be found on the live album Live at Benaroya Hall, various official bootlegs, the Live at the Gorge 05/06 box set and the Eddie Vedder DVD Water on the Road. On October 27, 2013 at their show in Baltimore, the band dedicated the song to Lou Reed who had died earlier that day. During a show in Chicago on August 22, 2016, Vedder dedicated the song to his late friend Layne Staley, lead singer of Alice in Chains. That day would have been Staley's 49th birthday; \"It\u2019s the birthday of a guy called Layne Staley tonight, and we\u2019re thinking of him tonight too. 49 years old\", Vedder told the crowd before dedicating the song to his friend."

His lyrics were at their most self-referential and only one overtly political song appeared, \"Ten Cents A Coup,\" which includes an earnest (though comical) spoken introduction strung together from two anti-war rallies.  The song is an ironic tribute to Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, who Ochs wryly suggests are more laughable than Laurel and Hardy. Among the self-referential tracks was \"Chords of Fame\", which warned against the dangers of cult of personality.  \"Boy In Ohio\" saw Ochs looking back nostalgically at his childhood and \"Jim Dean of Indiana\" was a tale of James Dean's life, a tribute to him, written after Ochs had visited Dean's grave. \"No More Songs\" was the most telling of the tracks, as Ochs would release but five more studio tracks in his lifetime after 1970, never completing another studio album."

Ochs wore a gold lam\u00e9 suit inspired by similar suits made famous by Presley, and hired Nudie Cohn, who made Presley's suits, to make his. During his show at Carnegie Hall, which was recorded to be released as a live album, Ochs told the audience a story explaining his choice to wear the suit. He told them he had died in Chicago, in reference to the violence he witnessed during the protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. He said God gave him a chance to come back to earth as anyone he wanted and Ochs chose Presley. He added that if there was any hope for America it \"relies on getting Elvis Presley to become Che Guevara\".

The first was Hairway to Steven, which references the song \"Stairway to Heaven\" by Led Zeppelin. The album's original title was going to be Oklahoma!, but fearing lawsuits, Capitol forced the band to change the name. Although the album has no Parental Advisory label, it was also released in a \"clean\" version with profanities removed, an alternate album cover, and the band being credited as \"B***H*** Surfers\". The song \"The Lord Is a Monkey\" was featured in two 1996 films, an alternate \"Rock Version\" in the Beavis and Butt-head Do America soundtrack and the original in Black Sheep.

This single - whose B-side is the earliest known recorded version of \"Yours Until Tomorrow\" by Gerry Goffin and Carole King - reached #13 R&B crossing over to #88 Pop in December 1966. Scoring two consecutive Top 20 R&B hits gave Warwick sufficient cachet for her first album release entitled I Want to Be With You/I'm Gonna Make You Love Me. Although Warwick had stronger chart showings than \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\", the song became her best-known hit by virtue of the Supremes/Temptations remake. \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" was the song Warwick performed at the 1999 Rhythm and Blues Foundation awards ceremony when she received a Pioneer Award. Jerry Ross overall produced ten recordings of \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\": these included a version on Jerry Butler's 1967 Soul Artistry album and another by Jay & the Techniques which was featured on the 1968 album release Love, Lost & Found. Ashford & Simpson sang background on all the versions of the song Ross produced with the Jay & the Techniques version also featuring Melba Moore."

Springfield passed the song on to Madeline Bell, her friend and regular background vocalist. Springfield sang backup vocals on Bell's version, which was featured on Bell's 1967 Philips album release Bell's a Poppin. According to Bell \"nothing happened with [the album] and the tapes were sent over to America and this one guy took a shine to 'I\u2019m Gonna Make You Love Me'. He printed up 10,000 copies and he sent them round the radio stations and they started playing it. I got a call from Philips in London to say that I had a record moving up the US charts and I had to go to America to promote it. It got to No.26 [and #32 R&B/ April 1968] and it was great to go back to my home town (Newark, New Jersey) with a record in the charts. I was so happy to go home a success.\" The US single of Bell's \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" featured \"Picture Me Gone\" by Chip Taylor and Al Gorgoni as the B-side: originally issued on the Mod label it had its wide release with the Philips logo. Bell's US success led Philips to release her single in the UK - there the B-side was \"I'm Gonna Leave You\" a composition by Bell, Springfield and Lesley Duncan - where it failed to chart. An I'm Gonna Make You Love Me album became Bell's only full-length release to appear on a major chart reaching #46 on the US R&B album chart. The summer of 1968 saw the release of another version of \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" as a single, this one on Cadet Concept by Aesop's Fables a Long Island-based blues/rock unit led by Sonny Bottari. Although this version failed to reach the national charts, it became the third version of \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\"  - after Warwick and Bell's - to receive airplay in Detroit within the period of a year and a half: within six months the Motown version brought the total to four."

Diana Ross and Eddie Kendricks shared lead vocals, although Otis Williams worked with Ross during a spoken interlude which was original to this version of the song. Ross & the Supremes and the Temptations performed several of the songs from their joint album on their headlining TCB television special which aired in December 1968 and it was originally planned that their rendition of \"The Impossible Dream\", the special's climactic performance, be their joint album's lead single. However radio stations began playing the \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" track off their advance copies of Diana Ross & the Supremes Join The Temptations compelling Motown to make \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" the single release even though it was not performed on TCB. Indeed, the Ross/Supremes & Temptations version was never to be performed live (the Temptations did perform \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" on The Ed Sullivan Show, Diana Ross and The Supremes performed the song which was recorded during their farewell performance in Las Vegas in 1970 and Diana Ross performed the song on The Hollywood Palace as a duet with Stevie Wonder). \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" reached #2 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and its R&B charts in January 1969: the Record World 100 Top Pops ranked \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" at #1 for the three weeks of 4 January to 18 January 1969 while Cash Box ranked the single #1 on its chart for 25 January 1969.

Dream Theater promoted the album on a year-long world tour, with the majority of concerts lasting almost three hours and featuring a different setlist each night.

        "content": "After completing a North American tour supporting one of their main influences, Yes, in summer 2004, Dream Theater took a two-month break. The band reconvened at The Hit Factory in New York City in November 2004 to begin work on their eighth studio album. The Hit Factory, a studio in which artists such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, Stevie Wonder, U2 and John Lennon had recorded, was earmarked for closure. Dream Theater was the last band to record there before it was permanently closed. After writing the concept album Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory, the double album Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and the metal-focused Train of Thought, the band decided to create \"a classic Dream Theater album\". Keyboardist Jordan Rudess described it as \"really going back to creating a real band effort, as well as drawing upon all our various stylistic influences.\" On Octavarium, the band wanted to make the music less complex, featuring songs which Rudess regards as \"quicker to appreciate\", although noted that the twenty-four-minute \"Octavarium\" was not as accessible. Guitarist John Petrucci noted that they wanted to focus on writing strong songs. To achieve this, the band stripped the sound down to piano, guitar and vocals when writing, focusing on the melodies and song structures. Drummer Mike Portnoy dismissed claims that Octavarium was an attempt to write a more commercial album, stating that the band simply \"[has] that side to [them]. We love bands like U2 or Coldplay, as well as liking shorter songs as well.\" Portnoy noted that, after writing Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and Train of Thought, they had not written an album of shorter songs for some time. He said that the band had found writing longer songs easier than writing shorter ones, and that the band was not trying to write a radio hit as \"the label wouldn't have done crap with it anyway.\" The band had previously written an orchestral-style piece in the form of \"Overture\" on Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, but recorded it using keyboards. The tracks \"The Answer Lies Within\", \"Sacrificed Sons\" and \"Octavarium\" marked the first time Dream Theater worked with an orchestra, conducted by Jamshied Sharifi (who studied at Berklee College of Music at the same time as Portnoy, Petrucci and bassist John Myung). The orchestra was selected based on their sight reading ability, allowing all their parts to be recorded in a maximum of two takes, even though they had never seen or played the music before. Sharifi would later go on to conduct the Octavarium Orchestra on Dream Theater's Score album."

        "content": "When starting to work on what would become Octavarium, Portnoy noted that it would be their eighth studio album and that they had recently released their fifth live album, Live at Budokan. This sequence mirrored the octave on a musical keyboard: each octave contains eight naturals and five accidentals. Portnoy suggested that they use that concept for the entire album. When writing, the band delegated each song a different key. Sound effects were placed between songs to connect them: for example, \"The Root of All Evil\", written in F minor, and the following track, \"The Answer Lies Within\", written in G minor, were connected by a sound effect in the key of F\u266f minor. The album's lyrics and song titles featured references to this concept. Portnoy cited the titles \"The Root of all Evil\" (referring to the musical term \"root\") and \"Octavarium\" (\"the octave of the octave\") as two examples of this. Octavarium begins \"The Root of All Evil\" with the final note of the band's previous album, Train of Thought with \"In the Name of God\". Train of Thought started \"As I Am\" with the last note from Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence with the title track, which in turn started with the noise that ended Scenes from a Memory at the end of \"Finally Free\". Portnoy was inspired to do this thanks to the Van Halen album Women and Children First; the outro of the album's final song ended with a new riff being played which faded out. Portnoy recalled that he expected Van Halen's next album to start with that ending riff, but was disappointed when it did not. He later realized he had \"dug a hole where we're expected to do it every time\". He solved this problem on Octavarium, where the final track ends with the beginning of the first one. This made the album a cycle in itself, allowing the band to have a clean start with their next album. At 04:52\u201305:17, there is a lyrical and musical reference to the chorus of \"This Dying Soul\" from Train of Thought. This reference comes from Portnoy\u2019s Twelve-step Suite. All of the negative time sections on the CD version were omitted on the digital versions initially, but later made available again."

        "content": "\"The Root of All Evil\" is the third part of Portnoy's Twelve-step Suite, a set of songs from various Dream Theater albums which describe his journey through Alcoholics Anonymous. The song contains parts six and seven of the suite: \"Ready\" and \"Remove\". \"The Answer Lies Within\" and \"I Walk Beside You\" are the two shortest tracks on the album. Rudess regards them as radio-friendly songs which still maintain Dream Theater's style. Portnoy wrote the lyrics to \"Never Enough\" as a response to fans who Portnoy perceived to complain about every thing that Dream Theater did. Portnoy stated that while he appreciated the devotion of Dream Theater's fans, he was frustrated because he was \"constantly tearing [himself] away from [his] family\" to give more to the fans. He found it discouraging that, even though he spent \"countless nights\" writing special setlists and the band spent days rehearsing, some fans would still complain that they went to a show and did not hear \"Pull Me Under\". \"It's discouraging and makes me crazy sometimes,\" he said. \"Sacrificed Sons\", at almost eleven minutes long, is the second-longest song on the album. Its lyrics, written by vocalist James LaBrie, deal with the September 11 attacks. Rudess noted that the band enjoyed writing about more serious topics instead of love songs. When working on the lyrics, LaBrie said that there was \"a lot of discussion\" about the song's wording and how direct it should be. The title track, \"Octavarium\", is the longest track on the album, at 24:00, and divided into five parts. Petrucci stated that the band wanted to write an epic song that thematically developed and would use an orchestra. The band was heavily influenced by the progressive rock sound of Genesis, Yes and Pink Floyd. The instrumental introduction, heavily influenced by Pink Floyd's \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", was performed by Rudess using a lap steel guitar and Continuum. Additionally, there are many references to other progressive rock songs in the lyrics. The song ends with the introductory theme of \"The Root of All Evil\" before fading out (instead there is an alternative version for some releases, with the reprise flute from the first part of \"Octavarium\" playing in the background). The ending establishes a cyclical theme to the album, and breaks the continuity of the meta-album established since Scenes from a Memory, thus allowing the band the opportunity for a fresh start on the next album."

So I thought we could do something based on the Newton's cradle.\" There are numerous references to the numbers five and eight throughout the artwork, alluding to the album's concept. For example, the Newton's cradle has eight suspended balls, and there are five birds on the cover. The album booklet features an octagonal maze, spider and octopus, among other references. The landscape on the cover is made up of a sky and grass from Indiana, and a background from the Lake District. Octavarium marked the beginning of an extended association with the band for Syme.

Blabbermouth.net reported that this was in response to the album being leaked. Portnoy stated that \"[he] chose to do this mainly [emphasis removed] to build anticipation for the big 'official' unveiling next week\", although noted that \"the repeated requests to refrain from spoilers and links for the new album against the band's wishes were frustrating\". Octavarium was released on June 7, 2005. It was their final album with Atlantic Records, ending a contract which had lasted fourteen years. Although in recent years the band had been allowed creative freedom, they were dissatisfied by the lack of promotion the label offered them. Portnoy released a DVD entitled Drumavarium in 2005, containing footage of his drum performance from the Octavarium recording sessions. Rudess released a solo piano version of \"The Answer Lies Within\" on his 2009 album Notes on a Dream. \"Panic Attack\" is featured as a playable song in Rock Band 2, where it is listed as the hardest song for both bass and drums."

        "content": "Octavarium reached the top five in the Finnish, Italian, and Swedish charts, as well as the top ten in the Dutch, Japanese, and Norwegian charts. Critical reception of the album was generally positive. Writing for Blistering, Justin Donnelly praised the album as \"diverse, melodic and hard hitting all at the same time\", ranking it as one of Dream Theater's best releases. He particularly praised the title track, considering it to be \"another Dream Theater classic\". Billboard considered the results of the band's attempt to write shorter songs and use warmer instrumental textures to be \"excellent\", particularly praising \"The Root of All Evil\", \"These Walls\" and \"I Walk Beside You\". Harley Carlson of MetalReview.com regarded Octavarium as \"successfully [showcasing] the band's ability to craft emotive music,\" although noted that it is \"unquestionably Dream Theater, yet there is something missing.\" Vik Bansal of musicOMH praised \"Never Enough\", \"Panic Attack\" and \"Sacrificed Sons\", but dismissed \"The Root of All Evil\" as \"Dream Theater by the numbers\". He criticized \"Octavarium\" as \"bloated\", although noted that fans of the band's A Change of Seasons would enjoy it. He said that \"there's enough on the remainder of Octavarium to keep the rest of us interested and the prog rock haters whining dismissively\". Writing for Exclaim!, Greg Pratt praised the album's artwork and production, but said that \"there\u2019s nothing that blows any minds here, or even gives a mild bend; hell, a good chunk of this disc feels like basic radio rock from the local old-guy bar band\". He noted that although there were some longer songs on the album, \"this just feels like 76 minutes of overdramatic rock, too heavy on the light and weak, and not enough time spent on just showing off\". Donnelly considered Octavarium to be \"somewhere between Images and Words, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and Train of Thought\". Carlson stated that the album \"draws closest comparison to Falling into Infinity and Metropolis II: Scenes from a Memory, but with far less complexity and edge.\" Tammy La Gorce of AllMusic noted that \"a post-hardcore edge - call it a leap into 2005 - has invaded [the band's] pledge of allegiance to theatrical heavy rock... What's changed is Dream Theater's commitment to carrying on their reputation as underground progressive rock's classicists, and it seems well-timed.\" Critics noted a strong Muse influence on some tracks, on some cases generating negative reviews."

        "content": "Dream Theater began the Octavarium Tour in support of Octavarium in Europe on June 10, 2005, beginning at the Sweden Rock Festival in S\u00f6lvesborg. The band co-headlined the Gigantour with Megadeth across North America from July 21 to September 3. The Montreal concert was recorded and released as a live album and concert video on August 22, 2006 and September 5, 2006 respectively, titled Gigantour. The main Octavarium world tour began in September in Finland, and saw the band continue with their \"An Evening With Dream Theater\" concert format. This meant the band would play for almost three hours, with a different setlist each evening. Many of the shows would center around a tour of the band's history to that point, featuring a song (or part of a longer song) for each album before wrapping up the regular set with several from Octavarium. Combined with interviews, rehearsals during soundcheck and meet-and-greet sessions with fans, the band became physically and mentally drained. Dream Theater performed two shows on consecutive nights both in Amsterdam and London. On the second night in both cities, the band covered the entirety of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon album. Theresa Thomason, who had previously performed on Scenes From a Memory, was flown in to perform vocals on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\". The London performance was released as a live album and concert video in 2006 by Portnoy's YtseJam Records. The band covered all of Deep Purple's Made in Japan at concerts in Tokyo and Osaka; a recording of which was also released as a live album by YtseJam Records in 2007. To celebrate the band's twentieth anniversary, the final concert on the tour was performed at Radio City Music Hall in New York on April 1, 2006. For the second half of the concert, the band was accompanied by a thirty-piece orchestra conducted by Jamshied Sharifi. The concert was filmed and released as a live album and concert video named Score on August 29, 2006 by Rhino Records."

        "content": "McCartney said, \"I wanted [the medley] to end with a little meaningful couplet, so I followed the Bard and wrote a couplet.\" In his 1980 interview with Playboy, John Lennon acknowledged McCartney's authorship by saying, \"That's Paul again ... He had a line in it, 'And in the end, the love you get is equal to the love you give,' which is a very cosmic, philosophical line. Which again proves that if he wants to, he can think.\" Lennon misquoted the line; the actual words are, \"And in the end, the love you take, is equal to the love you make...\" Recording began on 23 July 1969, when the Beatles recorded a one-minute, thirty-second master take that was extended via overdubs to two minutes and five seconds. At this point, the song was called \"Ending\". The first vocals for the song were added on 5 August, additional vocals and guitar overdubs were added on 7 August, and bass and drums on 8 August, the day the Abbey Road cover picture was taken. Orchestral overdubs were added 15 August, and the closing piano and accompanying vocal on 18 August. All four Beatles have a solo in \"The End\", including a Ringo Starr drum solo. Starr disliked solos, preferring to cater drumwork to whoever sang in a particular performance. His solo on \"The End\" was recorded with twelve microphones around his drum kit; in his playing, he said he copied part of Ron Bushy's drumming on the Iron Butterfly track \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\". The take in which Starr performed the solo originally had guitar and tambourine accompaniment, but other instruments were muted during mixing, giving the effect of a drum solo. McCartney, George Harrison and Lennon perform a rotating sequence of three, two-bar guitar solos. The idea for a guitar instrumental over this section was Harrison's, and Lennon suggested that the three of them each play a section. The solos begin approximately 53 seconds into the song. Geoff Emerick, the Beatles' recording engineer, later recalled: \"John, Paul and George looked like they had gone back in time, like they were kids again, playing together for the sheer enjoyment of it. More than anything, they reminded me of gunslingers, with their guitars strapped on, looks of steely-eyed resolve, determined to outdo one another. Yet there was no animosity, no tension at all \u2013 you could tell they were simply having fun.\" The first two bars are played by McCartney, the second two by Harrison, and the third two by Lennon, then the sequence repeats twice. Each has a distinctive style which McCartney felt reflected their personalities. Immediately after Lennon's third solo, the piano chords of the final line \"And in the end ...\" begin. Then the orchestration arrangement takes over with a humming chorus and Harrison playing a final guitar solo that ends the song. \"The End\" was initially intended to be the final track on Abbey Road, but it ended up being followed by \"Her Majesty\". Although \"The End\" stands as the last known new recording involving all four members of the Beatles, one additional song, \"I Me Mine\", was recorded by three members of the group (Lennon being absent due to having privately left in September 1969) in January 1970 for the album Let It Be. The 1996 compilation album Anthology 3 contains a remixed version of \"The End\", restoring tambourine and guitar overdubs mixed out of the original, and edited to emphasise the guitar solos and orchestral overdub. The track is followed by a variant on the long piano chord that ends \"A Day in the Life\", concluding the compilation. The drum solo was later used at the beginning of \"Get Back\" on the 2006 album Love."

        "content": "The song commences in A major, with an initial I\u2013IV\u2013II\u2013V\u2013I structure matching the vocals on \"Oh, yeah, all right!\" This is followed by a iv\u2009dim\u2013I pattern (Ddim to A chord) on \"dreams tonight.\" During this, the accompanying bass and one guitar move chromatically from A to B and D, while the second guitar harmonises a minor third higher to reach F. An eight bar drum solo as a final statement of recognition to their \"steady, solid drummer\" ends with a crescendo of eighth notes and bass and rhythm guitar in seventh chords to the chant \"Love you.\" The sequential three guitar solos rotate through I7 (A7 chord)\u2013IV7 (D7 chord) changes in the key of A in a mix of \"major and minor pentatonic scales with slides, double-stops, repeated notes, low-bass string runs and wailing bends\". Gould terms these live studio takes \"little character sketches\": Paul opens with a characteristically fluid and melodically balanced line that sounds a high A before snaking an octave down the scale; George responds by soaring to an even higher D and sustaining it for half a bar before descending in syncopated pairs of 16th notes; John then picks upon the pattern of George's 16ths with a series of choppy thirds that hammer relentlessly on the second and flattened seventh degrees of the scale. The second time through, Paul answers John's bluesy flattened 7ths with bluesy minor thirds and then proceeds to echo George's earlier line, spiraling up to that same high D; George responds with some minor thirds of his own, while mimicking the choppy rhythm of John's part; John then drops two octaves to unleash a growling single-note line. On this final two-bar solo, Paul plays almost nothing but minor thirds and flattened sevenths in a herky-jerky rhythm that ends with a sudden plunge to a low A; George then reaches for the stars with a steeply ascending line that is pitched an octave above any notes heard so far; and John finishes with a string of insistent and heavily distorted 4ths, phrased in triplets, that drag behind the beat and grate against the background harmony. The final \"Ah\" is in C with a spiritually evocative Plagal cadence IV\u2013I (F\u2013C chord) on piano while the voices do an F to E shift. \"And in the end the love you take\" is in A major, but the G/A chord supporting the word \"love\" begins to dissolve our certainty that we are in A, by adding a VII. The next line shifts us to the fresh key of C, with a iv (F) chord that threatens the dominance of the departing A key's F: \"Is eq-ual\" (supported successively by IV (F)\u2013iii (Em) chords with an A\u2013G bass line) \"to the love\" (supported successively by ii (Dm)\u2013vi (Am)\u2013ii7 (Dm7) chords with a F\u2013E bass line) \"you make\" (supported by a V7 (G7) chord). The final bars in the key of C involve a I\u2013II\u2013III rock-type progression and a IV\u2013I soothing cadence that appear to instinctively reconcile different musical genres."

McCartney's second guitar solo, Lennon's last guitar solo and Starr's drum solo were used in the intro to \"Get Back\" in the Beatles' Love. In Ralph Bakshi's 1972 film Fritz the Cat, Fritz quotes the line \"the love you give is equal to the love you get\" when deciding not to plant a bomb in a nuclear power plant and rejecting violent revolutionary politics. The character's creator, Robert Crumb, denounced this dialogue as \"red-neck and fascistic\". The Beastie Boys sampled a portion of \"The End\" for their track \"The Sounds of Science\" from Paul's Boutique. Chris Farley famously asked McCartney on the Chris Farley Show skit on Saturday Night Live, whether it was true that \"the love you take is equal to the love you make.\" McCartney replied, to Farley's delight, that, in his experiences, it was, saying \"the more you give, the more you get.\" Paul McCartney performed the closing couplet of \"The End\" at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony just prior to closing the event with a performance of the song \"Hey Jude\". Peter Brown used the song's lyric as the title of his book about the Beatles, The Love You Make. The closing couplet is sung by k.d. lang and partly spoken by Robin Williams (as the character Lovelace) at the end of the movie Happy Feet. \"And in the End...\", the final episode of the American TV series ER, is derived from the song's lyrics. The series finale of Criminal Minds is similarly titled \"And in the End\". The song was used as the final song played on the classic rock stations KMET and KSWD in Los Angeles as well as WNEW-FM and WPLJ in New York City."

Orbison's recording of the song, produced by Fred Foster for Monument Records, was the first major hit for the singer. It was described by The New York Times as expressing \"a clenched, driven urgency\". Released as a 45 rpm single by Monument Records in May 1960, \"Only the Lonely\" went to No. 2 on the United States Billboard pop music charts on 25 July 1960 (blocked by Brenda Lee's \"I'm Sorry\") and No. 14 on the Billboard R&B charts. \"Only the Lonely\" reached Number One in the United Kingdom, a position it achieved on 20 October 1960, staying there for two weeks (out of a total of 24 weeks spent on the UK singles chart from 28 July 1960). According to \"The Authorized Roy Orbison,\" \"Only the Lonely\" was the longest charting single of Orbison's career. Personnel on the original recording included Orbison's drummer Larry Parks, plus Nashville's regulars, Floyd Cramer on piano, Bob Moore on bass, and Hank Garland and Harold Bradley on guitars, Joe Melson and the Anita Kerr Singers on backing vocals. Drummer Buddy Harman played on the rest of the songs on the session."

        "content": "After several years without much success in the music business, and sharing a tiny apartment with his wife and new baby, Roy Orbison had taken to sitting in his car to write songs when, in 1958, his acquaintance Joe Melson tapped on the car window and suggested they collaborate. With Chet Atkins producing, they recorded several songs for RCA Nashville, only two of which were deemed worthy of release. Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of producer Fred Foster at Monument Records. There, Orbison would become one of the first recording artists to popularize the \"Nashville sound\". In his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded \"Paper Boy\" (a song that RCA had previously refused) while sound engineer Bill Porter experimented with close miking the doo-wop backing singers. Orbison requested a string section to perform in the studio, to augment the Nashville sound. The resulting recording had a \"polished, professional sound\u00a0... finally allow[ing] Orbison's stylistic inclinations free rein\". With this combination, Orbison recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was \"Uptown\". Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, \"We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world.\" However, \"Uptown\" only reached number 72 on the Billboard Top 100, and Orbison set his sights on negotiating a contract with an upscale nightclub somewhere. In early 1960, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote one more song, \"Only the Lonely\", which they tried to sell to Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers, who turned it down. (The song was subtitled \"Know The Way I Feel\" to avoid confusion with another song called \"Only The Lonely\", which Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen had written for Frank Sinatra in 1958.) Instead, they recorded \"Only the Lonely\" themselves at RCA's Nashville studio, using the string section and doo-wop backing singers that had given \"Uptown\" such an impressive sound. But this time, sound engineer Bill Porter tried a completely new strategy: building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background. This combination was to become Orbison's trademark sound. The recording also featured a falsetto note hit by Orbison that showcased a surprisingly powerful voice. According to biographer Alan Clayson, it \"came not from his throat but deeper within\". The song differed from the typical verse-chorus form structure of popular music of the time, building and falling to a climax, with emotional expression then rare for masculine performance. The single shot to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK, Ireland and Australia. According to Orbison, he and Melson now began constructing songs with Orbison's voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told Rolling Stone in 1988, \"I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Only the Lonely\", it kind of turned into a good voice.\" Instantly Orbison was in high demand. He appeared on American Bandstand and toured the U.S. for three months non-stop with Patsy Cline. When Presley heard \"Only the Lonely\" for the first time, the song he had turned down, he bought a box of the records to give out to his friends."

        "content": "I Want You is the fourteenth studio album by American soul singer and songwriter Marvin Gaye. It was released on March 16, 1976, by the Motown Records-subsidiary label Tamla. Gaye recorded the album during 1975 and 1976 at his studio Marvin's Room in Los Angeles and at Motown's Detroit-based Hitsville West studio. The album has often been noted by critics for producer Leon Ware's cinematic, downtempo sound, the erotic themes in his and Gaye's songwriting, and the singer's prominent use of the synthesizer. The album's cover artwork adapts neo-mannerist artist Ernie Barnes's famous painting The Sugar Shack (1971). I Want You consisted of Gaye's first recorded studio material since his highly successful and well-received album Let's Get It On (1973). While it marked a change in musical direction for Gaye, departing from his trademark Motown and doo-wop-influenced sound for funky, light-disco soul, the album maintained and expanded on his previous work's sexual themes. Following a mixed response from critics at the time of its release, I Want You has earned retrospective recognition from writers and music critics as one of Gaye's most controversial works and influential to such musical styles as disco, quiet storm, R&B, and neo soul."

        "content": "By 1975, Marvin Gaye had come off of the commercial and critical success of his landmark studio album Let's Get It On (1973), its successful supporting tour following the album's release, and Diana & Marvin (1973), a duet project with Diana Ross. However, similar to the conception and recording of Let's Get It On, Gaye had struggled to come up with an album as an appropriate follow-up. And much like Let's Get It On Gaye reached for outside help, this time seeking the assistance of Leon Ware, a singer and songwriter who had found previous success writing hits for fellow Motown alum, including pop singer Michael Jackson and the rhythm and blues group The Miracles. Ware had been working on songs for his own album which he would later issue under the title Musical Massage, a collection of erotic singles Ware had composed with a variety of writers, including Jacqueline Hillard and Arthur \"T-Boy\" Ross, brother of Diana Ross. When Motown CEO Berry Gordy paid a visit to Ware, the songwriter was more than happy to play Gordy his selection of tracks. After hearing a preliminary mix of the songs however, Gordy figured that Ware should let Gaye handle his material. While the majority of the album's songs were conceived by Ware, I Want You was transformed into a biographical centerpiece for Gaye, who was then in a volatile marriage with Anna Gordy, sister to Berry Gordy, and also in a long-standing affair with Janis Hunter, who would later become the mother of his two youngest children. Gaye and Hunter were introduced to each other by producer Ed Townsend in 1973 at Hitsville West, while Townsend and Gaye were recording Let's Get It On. Hunter was 17 years old while Gaye was seventeen years her senior at the time Townsend introduced them. In his book Mercy, Mercy Me: The Art, Loves, and Demons of Marvin Gaye, the author and music writer Michael Eric Dyson elaborated on the relationship between I Want You and Gaye's affair with Hunter: \"I Want You is unmistakably a work of romantic and erotic tribute to the woman he deeply loved and would shortly marry, Janis Hunter. Gaye's obsession with the woman in her late teens is nearly palpable in the sensual textures that are the album's aural and lyrical signature. Their relationship was relentlessly passionate and emotionally rough-hewn; they played up each other's strengths, and played off each other's weaknesses.\" Though it was often hinted that Let's Get It On was the album Gaye had dedicated to her, Marvin has stated that this album was dedicated to Hunter, who is believed to have been in the studio when he recorded it. According to music critics, her presence may have increased the emotion in Ware's and Gaye's conception of I Want You. From Gaye's first recordings of I Want You to the album's release in 1976, Hunter and Gaye married and divorced in the span of three short years. Having gone mostly silent since the years of Gaye's death, Janis broke her silence in 2013 by releasing a book titled, After the Dance: My Life with Marvin Gaye where she recalls her turbulent and often violent relationship with Marvin."

The recording sessions took place throughout 1975 and 1976. Much like Gaye's previous studio effort Let's Get It On, I Want You featured Gaye's contribution of background vocals and heavy multi-tracking. Gaye's vocalizing style was in classic doo-wop tradition accompanied by the low tempo of string arrangements and other instrumentation was provided by The Funk Brothers. Gaye's albums, and especially I Want You, have been influential on modern soul music and contemporary R&B. EMI Artists and Repertoire executive Gary Harris, who later assisted neo soul singer D'Angelo in recording his debut album Brown Sugar (1995), later commented on Gaye's significant artistry on I Want You and its opening title track. In an interview with writer Michael Eric Dyson, Harris comments on another popular track from the album \"Soon I'll Be Loving You Again\": Another significant feature of the recording sessions for I Want You was Gaye's use of the synthesizer in his music. During the time of recording, the instrument had entered its modern period of use and had been included in the music of such popular acts as Stevie Wonder and Led Zeppelin. For the instrumental version of \"After the Dance\", Gaye implemented it for a more spacey sound than his previous recordings had featured. Other recordings from these sessions to feature Gaye's synthesizer were later featured on the deluxe edition re-release of I Want You."

        "content": "The original The Sugar Shack painting, which was later used for the front album cover of I Want You, was painted and released by neo-mannerist artist Ernie Barnes in 1971. In 1976, Barnes redesigned the painting for use by television producer Norman Lear for the opening credits of Good Times, his hit CBS sitcom that ran from 1974 to 1979. The Sugar Shack portrays a cultural image of a shack full of black people dancing. The Sugar Shack was painted by Barnes in his signature post-mannerist style, using serpentine lines, elongation of the human figure, clarity of line, unusual spatial relationships, painted frames, and distinctive color palettes. This style of technique and composition is similar to the mannerist style of 16th-century artists such as Michelangelo and Raphael, which has led Barnes to be credited as the founder of the Neo-Mannerism movement. Art critic Frank Getlein later called The Sugar Shack a \"stunning demonstration of the fusion of Neo-Mannerism and Genre painting that Barnes alone has perfected and practices\", and went on to say: The Sugar Shack has been known to art critics for embodying the style of art composition known as \"Black Romantic\", which, according to Natalie Hopkinson of The Washington Post, is the \"visual-art equivalent of the Chitlin' Circuit.\" According to Barnes, he created the original version after reflecting upon his childhood, during which he was not \"able to go to a dance.\" In an interview with SoulMuseum.net, Barnes was asked whether there were any messages he was attempting to express through the painting. He stated \"'Sugar Shack' is a recall of a childhood experience. It was the first time my innocence met with the sins of dance. The painting transmits rhythm so the experience is re-created in the person viewing it. To show that African-Americans utilize rhythm as a way of resolving physical tension\" Gaye was introduced to Barnes by colleague Barbara Hunter, which led to him buying eight Barnes originals, including The Sugar Shack. After Gaye asked him for permission to use the painting as an album cover, Barnes then augmented the painting by adding references to Gaye's album, including banners hanging from the ceiling of the shack promoting the album's singles. Since the initial wide acclaim for The Sugar Shack, Barnes has gained further recognition from art critics as one of the best black painters of his time and was cited by the Oakland Tribune as the \"Picasso of the black art world.\" The original piece was later purchased by actor and comedian Eddie Murphy."

        "title": "I Want You (Marvin Gaye album)_Release and reception",
        "content": "I Want You was released March 16, 1976 in the United States on the Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. While not as successful sales-wise as Gaye's previous landmark albums What's Going On and Let's Get It On, I Want You sold in excess of 1 million copies in the United States with help mostly coming from its first single \"I Want You\". The single topped the Billboard Soul Singles chart, quickly becoming Marvin Gaye's eleventh number-one hit on that chart, while peaking at number fifteen on the Billboard Pop Singles chart. The album's second single, the quiet storm track \"After the Dance (Vocal)\", charted modestly, peaking at #14 on the Soul Singles chart and #74 on the Pop Singles chart, while another single release version of the song, a double A-sided vinyl record for dance clubs and discoth\u00e8ques, hit the top ten of the Billboard Disco Singles chart. The song became a staple of dance clubs and discoth\u00e8ques during the late 1970s. \"After the Dance\" was hailed as one of Gaye's signature songs during the late 1970s and was later described by Gaye-biographer David Ritz as \"emblematic for the final chapter of his career.\" I Want You became his fourth album to reach the top ten of the Billboard 200 chart and his fifth number-one album on the Soul Albums chart. Despite its chart success, I Want You received mixed reviews from music critics at the time of its release. It has been noted by music writers that the critical reception of disco music in general had been poor and ill-considered, which may have caused the slightly disco-styled I Want You to suffer critically, in comparison to Gaye's previous albums. Los Angeles Times writer Dennis Hunt called the album \"disappointing\" and \"only partially commendable\". Rolling Stones Vince Aletti criticized Leon Ware's production for being too low-key, and perceived that Gaye lacks the certain passion in his lyricism and singing from his previous records. Aletti compared the album to Gaye's previous work, writing  that \"Gaye seems determined to take over as soul's master philosopher in the bedroom, a position that requires little but an affectation of constant, rather jaded horniness. The pose has already been established in Let's Get It On, on which Gaye was hot, tender, aggressive, soothing and casually raunchy\u2014the modern lover with all his contradictions. I Want You continues in the same vein but with only the faintest traces of the robust passion that shot through and sustained the earlier album\u00a0... one expects something with a little more substance and spirit. But there's no fire here, only a well-concealed pilot light.\" Cliff White of NME called the album \"almost a voyeur's delight\", and was not favorable of Gaye's sensual themes, stating \"Although getting down, getting mellow, and getting it on are paramount considerations in the privacy of my own home, I don't particularly want to be party to someone else's night life. Not on record anyway\u00a0... Like peeking through the windows of the Gaye residence in the wee wee hours. Perhaps that's your kick, but personally I find it a mite frustrating.\"<ref name=\"White\">White, Cliff. \"Review: I Want You]\". NME: May 8, 1976.</ref> White also criticized the album's sound, describing the songs as \"all expressions of the same mood. Sensual, satisfied, and spaced out\", and calling I Want You \"simply the explorative aftermath of Let's Get It On. The sweet nuthin's of a drowsy, sweat-streaked lover.\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote favorably of the album's sound quality. However, he criticized the lyrical content, as well as Ware's involvement in songwriting, stating \"was it Ware who instructed Marvin to eliminate all depth and power from his voice? I mean, if you're into insisting on sex it's in bad taste to whine about it.\""

        "title": "I Want You (Marvin Gaye album)_Legacy and influence",
        "content": "After critical re-examination of the album, I Want You has been recognized by writers and music writers as one of Marvin Gaye's most controversial and influential works and, much like its predecessor Let's Get It On, has served as a major influence on the quiet storm and contemporary R&B genres. Its standing has also improved among critics following an expanded edition release of the album on July 29, 2003, which featured extensive liner notes and photography by Ryan Null. Following that release, AllMusic praised Gaye's different direction in music and the eroticism portrayed in Leon Ware's smooth-tempo production and Gaye's intimate lyricism. Reviewer Thom Jurek wrote: Such musicians as Todd Rundgren, Robert Palmer and Madonna have stated they were influenced by I Want You, while songs from the album have been sampled by such hip hop artists as EPMD to Mary J. Blige, who sampled the title track for her hit song \"Be Happy\". The careers of neo soul and R&B musicians including D'Angelo, Musiq Soulchild, R. Kelly, Maxwell (particularly on Urban Hang Suite), Sade, and Prince show the influence of the soulful sound and equally romantic and erotic lyrics of I Want You, Let's Get It On and Leon Ware's Musical Massage.Musical Massage: Review. PopMatters. Retrieved on 2009-03-31. According to one critic, Ware's arrangements \"solidified the suite-like theme for the album.\" Much like Let's Get It On, slow jam music, as well as modern soul and the quiet storm genre, are now viewed by critics to have been engendered by I Want You and by Gaye. Following the release of I Want You, Ware released Musical Massage (1976), which received little mainstream notice. Despite this, Musical Massage, Ware's second studio album, became a cult hit among soul music fans who were intrigued by I Want You and songs from that album's producer. Critical recognition of Ware's album later improved, being cited by AllMusic as \"the perfect mix of soul, light funk, jazz, and what was about to become the rhythmic foundation for disco.\""

It was written by Jackson, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Jackson's then-husband, Ren\u00e9 Elizondo Jr. It was released on February 24, 1998, by Virgin Records as the album's third single. The track is a departure from Jackson's signature brand of crossover dance-pop and R&B into a pure R&B and soul vibe. Lyrically, it expresses loneliness and the desire for an estranged lover. A remixed version of the song featured American R&B group Blackstreet. \"I Get Lonely\" became Jackson's eighteenth consecutive top-ten hit on the US Billboard Hot 100, setting a record as the only female artist in history to achieve that feat. The song received a BMI Pop Award for \"Most Played Song\" and a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and was later included on Janet's second greatest hits album Number Ones (2009). Its music video, directed by Paul Hunter, received positive reception for its abounding sex appeal."

        "content": "\"I Get Lonely\" is a departure from Janet's usual mix of dance-pop and R&B, as the song is more neo soul-oriented. It was released as the third single from Jackson's sixth album The Velvet Rope, which chronicled Jackson's struggle with depression and intimacy. In an interview for MTV, she discussed how the depression was causing her to experience deep sadness, forcing her to take breaks from her music career. During the writing and recording of The Velvet Rope she began to spontaneously cancel recording sessions and appeared constantly troubled. The themes of loneliness and abandonment that are explored in \"I Get Lonely\" are a direct reflection of the emotional state that Jackson was in during the production of the album. Jackson described the album as her most personal work, developed throughout her entire lifetime. She explained, \"I never looked deeply at the pain from my past, never tried to understand that pain and work it through. It was a journey I had avoided. But one I now had to face.\""

Vibe called \"I Get Lonely\" a \"gigantic voicey song\" and praised its structure, saying \"the song starts with the beautifully overblown chorus [...] After that, it's official: you're singing it until next year. There're, like, 40 Janets singing the chorus, and she harmonizes with herself like she's the Pips. Honey butter. This is where she wins.\" The review also noted Jackson's vocal performance as being both heartfelt and convincing, observing \"Or maybe Janet Jackson really feels lonely. Because she sounds more convincing, more alive, on \"I Get Lonely\" than on The Velvet Ropes title song, better than when she's singing about any of that tie-me-up-tie-medown, gettin'-freaked-from-behind \"rope burn\" stuff.\" Yahoo! Music described \"I Get Lonely\" as highlighted by \"catchy chord progressions\" while The L.A. Times says the song \"plumbed relatively raw neo-soul depths.\" A review from Uproxx also praised the song's quality, stating \"It's hard to pinpoint the best aspect of the song: the opening seconds, its melody, the hook or the way Ms. Jackson's voice flutters seamlessly over the beat. What's apparent, however, is that those three traits and more meshed to produce one of the standout records from the most famous female Jackson and a testament of what R&B once was.\""

A demo of Riley's remix titled the \"Teddy Riley Test Pressing Mix\" features an instrumental similar to the original and also has alternate, more subdued vocals by Riley and Blackstreet. MTV reported on the release of the remix, stating \"After using Gang Starr's DJ Premier on [remixes of] \"Together Again,\" Jackson called in Teddy Riley of Blackstreet to work on 'I Get Lonely.'\" Jackson revealed to MTV that she and Riley managed to collaborate on the concept for the remix \"via phone.\" Jackson stated \"[Riley] called me every single day with different ideas,\" Jackson continued, \"and I would say, 'O.K., that's cool.

So he'd put a little bit down and call me and play it for me and it was fun.\" Billboard critiqued the song's various remixes, commenting \"Top 40 programmers who prefer Janet as a disco diva are treated to a solid, pop-smart house remix by Jason Nevins, while the cut's original co-producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, contribute an odd if ultimately useful booty-bass remix.

Of course, quietly tacked between the numerous trend-conscious remixes of \"I Get Lonely\" is the far superior album version. Why not be among the few programmers to buck trends and let the original version works its unmistakable magic?\" Regarding the TNT Remix, Billboard commented: \"Teddy Riley has been enlisted to spruce up the track with a skittling jeep groove, while Janet's yearning, thickly layered vamps are complemented by a single-only guest appearance by Blackstreet\", adding Jackson's and \"the groups' voices blend extremely well.\""

One of his influences was Leroy Carr, whose \"How Long\u2013How Long Blues\" (1928) was an early favorite.  Johnson later used the melody from Carr's \"When the Sun Goes Down\" (1935) as the basis for \"Love in Vain\". Both songs express a yearning and sorrow for the loss of a lover. Johnson also used some lyrics from \"Flying Crow Blues\" (1932) by the Shreveport Home Wreckers (a duo of Oscar \"Buddy\" Woods and Ed Schaffer) for the final verse of \"Love in Vain\".  Sonny Boy Williamson II recorded a song with a similar title, \"All My Love in Vain\", but different lyrics."

After the release of Johnson's first compilation album, King of the Delta Blues Singers (1961), bootleg albums containing more of Johnson's 1930s singles were circulated.  This was the first appearance of the song since its original release.  Columbia Records responded by issuing King of the Delta Blues Singers, Vol. II (1970), which included an alternate take of \"Love in Vain\". The original single version was finally reissued (along with the alternate) by Columbia on the box set The Complete Recordings (1990).

        "content": "\"Butterfly\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter, and record producer Mariah Carey for her sixth studio album of the same name (1997). It was released on December 1, 1997, by Columbia Records as the second single from the album. The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. \"Butterfly\" is a  pop and R&B ballad combining elements of gospel. Carey had originally conceived it as a house record with David Morales titled \"Fly Away\" (Butterfly Reprise). After realizing how personal the lyrics were and how they could be applied to Butterfly, she wrote the album's title track with Afanasieff. On the song's lyrics, Carey sings to someone, telling them to spread their wings and release into the world on their own, like a butterfly. The accompanying music video for \"Butterfly\" depicts Carey in an abandoned house, trapped in a desolate life. As the video progresses, she leaves, apparently for the first time in years, and runs into a nearby meadow. Towards the end, Carey jumps over a barbed fence and goes out into the world on a horse. The song's lyrics and video were directly connected to Carey's personal life at the time. \"Butterfly\" was performed live on the Late Show with David Letterman, Saturday Night Live, and various European television programs. The song was also a permanent part of the set-list during her Butterfly World Tour during 1998. Due to current conflict with Columbia, \"Butterfly\" was never issued a commercial release, therefore hindering its charting ability. The single performed weakly on the charts, peaking outside the top 20 in most countries, except for New Zealand, where it peaked at number 15. The song also reached the top-ten in Croatia and Taiwan. In 2003, Q Magazine ranked \"Butterfly\" at number 563 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\"."

        "content": "During the recording for Butterfly, Carey was in the midst of her separation from then husband, Tommy Mottola. While writing the material for the album, she wrote a house music record titled \"Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)\" with David Morales. When the song was finished, Carey felt there was something more she could do with the song; the lyrics were very personal and a perfect fit for a ballad. After contemplating on the matter, Carey re-wrote \"Fly Away\" in ballad form, and incorporated new lyrics and vocals. It was '97 and I was leaving my marriage [to Tommy Mottola]. which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's what he would say to me. There's a part that goes, 'I have learned that beauty / has to flourish in the light / wild horses run unbridled / or their spirit dies / you have given me the courage / to be all that I can / and I truly feel ...[sings] and I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me when you're ready to land.' At that point I really believed that I was going to go back to the marriage \u2013 I didn't think I was going to leave forever. But then the things that happened to me during that time caused me to not go back. Had it been, 'Go be yourself, you've been with me since you were a kid, let's separate for a while,' I probably would've. The song was named \"Butterfly\" and became Carey's \"favorite and most heartfelt ballad.\" Its lyrics were very personal, linking to Carey's personal life and relationship with Mottola. Carey wrote \"Butterfly\" for Mottola, hoping he would say its contents to her, and choose to do what was best for her. She described the song as \"the best ballad she had ever written\" and credited it as the epitome of her magnum opus, which was Butterfly."

As part of \"layering the song,\" background vocals are featured throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge. It is set in the signature common time, and is written in the key of A major. It features a basic chord progression of A-F-1. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G3 to the high note of A6; the piano and guitar pieces range from A3 to A5. The song contains choral lyrics written by Carey, who produced the song's melody and chorus as well. Aside from assisting with its writing and chord progression, Afanasieff co-arranged and produced the track as well. In his review for the album, David Browne commented on the song's lyrics and message \"The title song, a slice of florid pop gospel, explores the old if-you-love-someone-set-her-free theme; It isn't a reach to interpret these songs as describing life with the reportedly controlling Mottola."

The notable maturity in her lyrics and worldly warmth of her vocal reflect the growth that she has continually strived to attain.\" Rick Juzwiak from Slant Magazine gave the song a mixed review, but felt it was a pivotal part of Carey's vocal and musical transition. Juzwiak wrote \"The agonizingly slow 'Butterfly,' with its predictably soaring chorus and if-it-comes-back-it-was-meant-to-be message, would have been ignorable tripe. Here, it's a show for the peeping. Echoes of her newly failed relationship with Mottola bounce off the gospelly song's cheap stained glass and then garble so that it sounds like some insane document of Stockholm Syndrome.\" He felt however, that the song was an important part of the album, \"It isn't just subject matter that elevates 'Butterfly' above Carey's usual melodrama. Carey's vocal delivery and her willingness to experiment with it helped define the album, so it's only appropriate that its title track is the first of many to showcase Carey's much-debated 'whisper voice.'\" Ian Hyland from Sunday Mirror gave it eight out of ten, commenting, \"Flouncing around in sexy beige slips apart, ballads are what Mariah does best. And I'm more than happy to report she's still doing fine on both counts.\""

        "content": "The single's music video was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It was inspired by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream Carey had one night. The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning; only his feet are shown. Carey is first seen residing in the derelict house, in the middle of a large meadow. She awakes, sad and depressed, wearing battered and disheveled clothing. As she walks down the stairs, Carey sits on the staircase, lamenting in agony at her loneliness. As the video climaxes, Carey is seen finally leaving the foyer, apparently for the first time in many years, escaping from the misery she once called home. As she reaches the outskirts of the property, Carey mounts a horse, which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence. After leaving, Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video, while waving her arms in the air. The video drew many comparisons to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, served as a metaphor for the things that were taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, because it is the best thing for them; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness. The music video for \"Butterfly\" was published on Carey's official YouTube channel in November 2009. It has amassed more than 35 million views as of September 2021."

On November 15, Carey performed the song live on Saturday Night Live, alongside \"My All.\" The performance featured the same musicians on set, with the exception of Afanasieff, who was absent.  In Europe, Carey performed the song on the popular German game show, Wetten, dass..?, featured only three female back-up singers. In France, Carey visited the talk show, \"The Hit Machine,\" where she performed the song as well. After completing the song, Carey received a standing ovation. The song was sung during her Butterfly World Tour in 1998, a part of the set list of every show. For the performances in Japan, Carey donned a long flowing gown, and featured live back-up. During the performance, large images of butterflies were projected onto the large screen behind her. The performances served as one of the closing songs on the set-list. Similar props and set-up were used for the following shows of the tour, with the addition on the \"Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)\" addition at the show's finale.  In subsequent tours, the chorus of the song was played by the band and sung by the background vocals at the end of each concert as Carey would exit the stage.  In the Angels Advocate Tour an instrumental version was played as an introduction while Carey entered the stage. \"Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)\" was put as the introduction of Carey's shows during her second concert residency placed in Las Vegas, The Butterfly Returns (2018) to match its theme."

Very nearly as catchy as her debut\". Shannon Barbour from Cosmopolitan opined that it was \"not her best song, but it's insanely addictive\". Nicholas Hautman, from Us Weekly,  deemed it the singer's ninth greatest single and said: \"This quasi-dorky dance track can be easily summed up using just three words: pure ear candy\". For Digital Spy's Alim Kheraj the most notable thing was the song's prominent use of cowbells; \"backed up by rock guitars and flawless Max Martin production, Britney sounds confident, her vocals clear and powerful\". In 2019, the staff of Billboard ranked the \"Stop! Remix\" as the 39th greatest song of 1999; Nolan Feeney said that although it was \"hardly unrecognizable\", Spears' re-recorded vocals, the song's new intro and  \"her headline 'Stop!' interjection in the reimagined bridge made it something truly worth losing your mind over\"."

Kelly's \"If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time\". In the United Kingdom, it was Spears' third consecutive single to reach a top five position. The track debuted and peaked at number five on the chart issue dated October 2, 1999, and stayed on the chart for a total of eleven weeks. It was eventually certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), for sales and streams of over 400,000 units. According to the Official Charts Company, \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" is Spears' seventh best-selling single in the United Kingdom, with sales over 275,000 physical units. The song peaked at number two in France and number four in Germany, being certified Gold in both countries for shipping over 250,000 units. It also peaked at number one in Belgium (Wallonia), finishing the year of 1999 as the 17th best-selling single. \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was also able to peak inside the top five in Belgium (Flanders), Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, while reaching top ten positions in Denmark and Italy. Later in 2012, the song managed to peak at number 65 in Czech Republic due to high airplay. In the United States, \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" peaked at number ten on Billboard Hot 100 on the chart issue dated November 13, 1999, and became Spears' second single to peak inside the top ten in the country. On the same week, it peaked at number four on the Pop Songs component chart. On the chart compiled by RPM magazine, the song peaked at number three in Canada. However, on the Canadian Singles Chart compiled by Nielsen Soundscan, it peaked at number 13. The latter revealed that \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was the 44th best-selling single of 1999 in the country. The track peaked at number five in New Zealand, but failed to reach the top ten in Australia, where it peaked at number 12 on the chart issue dated November 12, 1999. However, the single was later certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and was one of the best-selling singles of 2000 in the country. \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" performed poorly in Japan, where it peaked at number 80, and stayed on the chart for two weeks only. Despite the low sales, it is Spears' 12th best-selling CD release in the country."

        "content": "The song's accompanying music video (which uses the Stop! Remix) was directed by Nigel Dick and filmed on June 14 and 15, 1999 at the AES Power Station in Redondo Beach, California. Spears conceptualized the video's treatment, and explained during an interview with MTV in 1999 that \"it would be cool to be in a club, and we're dorky waitresses, and we break out and start dancing.\" At the time, Spears expected that the video would take her \"to the next level\". To promote the film Drive Me Crazy, actors Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart were invited to make cameo appearances in the video, since the song had been included on the film's soundtrack, however, Grenier did not want to participate. Dick commented on the issue, saying, \"I was given instructions to ring him up and make sure he appeared in the video. I said, 'You know what, Adrian, I just think it would be great for your career, and Britney's a great girl and she's fun to work with.' Eventually he came around.\" Dick also revealed that he was impressed by the singer's work ethic, adding that she \"came to the set completely rehearsed.\" The music video premiered on MTV's Making the Video special that aired on July 18, 1999. Due to Hart's appearance in the music video, parts of it were featured in the credits of the Season 4 premiere of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, an episode that guest starred Spears. The video opens with Spears as a waitress of a dance club. She then goes with other waitresses to their dressing room, where they finish their makeup and change costumes. Spears, now wearing a sexy, green sequined outfit, goes through the corridor to the dance floor with her friends, and starts to perform a high-profile choreography, including a chair dance sequence referencing Janet Jackson's \"Miss You Much\" video, which Spears also referenced in live performances of the song on the \"Crazy 2K Tour\". Scenes of Spears singing in front of a shining orange sign with the word \"CRAZY\" are also seen throughout the video. On August 24, 1999, the music video debuted at number four on Total Request Live. It is the longest running by a female artist on TRL, staying on the top ten for seventy-three days. The video was nominated on the category of Best Dance Video on the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards; it lost, however, to Jennifer Lopez's \"Waiting for Tonight\" (1999). An alternate footage of the video can be found on the DVD of Spears' first compilation album Greatest Hits: My Prerogative (2004). Jennifer Vineyard of MTV commented, \"the alternate audio gives the feel of Spears singing the song as a round, where the beat is in sync but one layer of her vocals is just slightly ahead of the other.\""

        "content": "Spears performed the song for the very first time at her L'Oreal Hair Zone Mall Tour in New York City, USA on July 1, 1998. As part of promotion for \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\"s release as a single, Spears performed it at the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards and at the 1999 Billboard Music Awards. It was also performed on five concert tours, the first being the ...Baby One More Time Tour (1999). The show began with a dance introduction by Spears' dancers among smoke effects. She appeared shortly after at the top of the staircase wearing a hot pink vinyl tube top and white vinyl pants with pink knee patches. During the 2000 leg of the tour, entitled Crazy 2k Tour, Spears changed the opening sequence of the show; the show started with a skit in which the dancers came out of lockers and stayed in the stage until a bell rang. They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged at the top of the staircase in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white stretch pants, to perform a short dance mix of \"...Baby One More Time\". She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\", which included a chair dance sequence referencing Janet Jackson's \"Miss You Much\" music video that ended with Spears saying \"Is that the end?\", quoting Jackson's phrase from the video. The song was once again performed in a dance-oriented form on the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour (2000\u20132001), while on the Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001\u20132002), the performance featured Spears being captured by her dancers. \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was also performed on The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004). For the tour, the song was remixed with elements of latin percussion. \"Crazy\" would not be performed by Spears for another nine years until it was included on the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show, Britney: Piece of Me (2013\u20132017). In 2002, British nu metal band SugarComa covered \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" and included it on their album Becoming Something Else. American musician Richard Cheese also covered the song in 2003 and included it on his album Tuxicity. American pop band Selena Gomez & the Scene performed a homage to Spears during their 2011 We Own the Night Tour. They performed \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" along with a medley of hits that included \"...Baby One More Time\", \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", \"Toxic\" and \"Hold It Against Me\", mixed similar to the Chris Cox Megamix included in Greatest Hits: My Prerogative. In the 2012 Glee episode \"Britney 2.0\", the characters of Marley Rose and Jake Puckerman performed a medley of the track with Aerosmith's \"Crazy\" (1993)."

        "content": "Technodelic is the fifth studio album by Yellow Magic Orchestra, released in 1981. The album is notable for its experimental approach and heavy use of digital samplers which were not commonly used until the mid-to-late 1980s, resulting in a more minimalist and avant-garde sound compared to their previous work. It is considered the first released album to feature mostly samples and loops, influencing the heavy use of sampling and looping in popular music. Yellow Magic Orchestra's approach to sampling music was a precursor to the contemporary approach of constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them using computer technology. In 2008, Sonic Youth frontman Thurston Moore provided a cover of \"Gradated Grey\" for the Haruomi Hosono tribute album Strange Songbook (Tribute To Haruomi Hosono 2). In 2016, the Canadian post-punk group Preoccupations covered the track \"Key\" as a part of a 7\" vinyl that came with pre-orders of their self-titled album alongside a cover of The Raincoats' 1979 track \"Off-Duty Trip\"."

        "content": "Most of the sampling was made with an LMD-649, a custom-built digital sampler developed by Toshiba-EMI engineer Kenji Murata. The LMD-649 was the first PCM digital sampler, capable of playing and recording PCM samples with a 12-bit audio depth and 50\u00a0kHz sampling rate, stored in 128 KB of dynamic RAM memory. It also had sampling drum machine capabilities. Notable samples used include Indonesian kecak chanting (\"Neue Tanz\"), gamelan and short looped vocals (\"paa\", \"fuku\", \"chiki\") for percussion in \"Seoul Music\", and the final two tracks feature factory noises. The LMD-649 was later used by other Japanese synthpop artists in the early 1980s, including YMO-associated acts such as Chiemi Manabe and Logic System in 1982. The album also features use of speech through a two-way radio, a prepared piano, a Roland TR-808 drum machine (previously used in BGM), and Prophet-5 synthesizers. In another departure from previous albums, Haruomi Hosono has a more prominent role playing the bass guitar as opposed to playing bass lines on synthesizers (this trend appears again on the album Service). As with many of YMO's releases, song titles are printed in both Japanese and English. For \"Seoul Music\", the kanji \"\u4eac\u57ce\" are used, referring to Gyeongseong (\uacbd\uc131; known as Keijou in Japan), the name of Seoul when Korea was under Japanese rule. \"\u706f\" refers to the light of a lantern. \"Neue Tanz\" is German for \"New Dance\", while \"Tais\u014d\" is Japanese for \"gymnastics\" or \"calisthenics\". For its single release, the track \"Tais\u014d\" was given a music video directed by Haruomi Hosono and Norimasa Okumura. The video features the members of YMO, dressed in uniforms designed by Yukihiro Takahashi, along with Takahashi's then manager Hiromi Kanai performing calisthenics against various chroma key backdrops, parodying real-world televised calisthenics broadcasts in Japan."

On February 2, 2005, We're Not Happy 'til You're Not Happy was announced for release in two months' time. They embarked on a co-headlining tour with Bowling for Soup. \"The Fire\" was posted on the band's Myspace profile on March 18, 2005 ahead of the album. We're Not Happy 'til You're Not Happy was released on April 5, 2005 through Jive Records. In June 2005, they toured Europe, and then went on a US tour with American Hi-Fi, Punchline and Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer between June and August 2005. American Hi-Fi dropped off the tour  and were replaced by Catch 22 from the July 17 date, as Barrett explains: \"[American Hi-Fi] weren't being received very well by the ska kids, and because they were pretty burnt out from being on tour for a year and a half non-stop\". In late August 2005, they filmed a music video for \"Don't Start a Band\" with director Jonathan London. The following month, the band went on a month-long tour of the UK with the Matches, Skindred and My Awesome Compilation. They toured across New Zealand and Australia with Goldfinger and the Matches, leading up to a one-off show in Hawaii. On September 22, 2005, the \"Don't Start a Band\" video was posted online. While in New Zealand, trumpeter Scott Klopfenstein was hospitalized due to what the band referred to as \"abnormal fatigue\"; the rest of the band continued their scheduled performances. They went on a brief East Coast US tour with the Tossers and Transition. Reel Big Fish closed the year with a New Year's Eve show in Costa Mesa, California, with Klopfenstein back in the band. Reel Big Fish opened 2006 with a co-headlining West Coast US tour with Goldfinger, dubbed the Deep Freeze Tour; they were supported by Zebrahead and Bottom Line. On January 13, 2006, the band announced they left Jive Records, with their manager Vince Pileggi explaining that the \"traditional major label business model is a dinosaur whose feet are already covered in tar\". A UK leg of the tour followed without Goldfinger, running into February 2006. Klopfenstein had to be flown home due to his previous illness flaring up as the rest of the band continued on a tour of mainland Europe. In March 2006, the band performed at The International Ska Circus festival. In July and August 2006, the band embarked on a headlining US tour, with support from MxPx, Streetlight Manifesto, Transition, and Whole Wheat Bread. In the midst of this, the band released the live album Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album, which was recorded across several shows. Between October and December 2006, the band toured across the US with support from Streetlight Manifesto, Suburban Legends, and Westbound Train."

        "content": "For two years, Embrace wrote and recorded songs on tape, resulting in an immense amount of possible album material, 500 \"songs and half-songs\" compiled on 52 C90 tapes. In December 2003, after four listening sessions spread over two years, MacDonald finally gave the go-ahead to the band to begin recording for their next album. Later that month, Embrace played three secret gigs as \"The Good Good People\" at Leeds' Cockpit to \"road test\" the new material in preparation for recording. The band brought in Youth to produce, having had good experiences with his production on singles All You Good Good People and Come Back to What You Know from their first album, The Good Will Out. Most of the band were excited about the effect that bringing new leadership into the studio was having on their music, but Danny McNamara, the band's lead singer, had a tough time adjusting to Youth's production style: \"January, February and March this year were the hardest time of my life. I was getting four hours sleep a night. Every morning I'd get up and have to take a pill just to stay calm that day. The amount of arguments and throwing shit...It was really intense.\" Youth changed McNamara's song structures, his lyrics, and pushed him to sing with more emotion. Said McNamara: \"There were times I hated him. I'd ring our manager and have meetings with the label, where I'd say, 'Look, can you tell him who's boss? 'Cause he's not listening to me.'\" Thankfully, the label kept its position that Youth was in charge, because gradually, things started to click between the band and its producer. McNamara eventually changed his tune, saying, \"I think I've grown as a person...the idea of relinquishing control and just having a bit of belief and faith in someone else is new to me in my thirty-three years. And it's paid off. I've left my ego at the door.\" Several songs began to take shape and sound that had previously eluded the band. Out of the 500 possibilities, the band eventually narrowed the list of potential album cuts down to fifteen songs, and then finally decided on the best ten. These included \"Ashes,\" which started life in 2001 as a piano-driven ballad and eventually took the form of a four-minute long anthem of a pop song, \"Someday,\" whose verse was written in 1997 and waited seven years for the rest of the song to show up, and \"Everytime I See Your Face,\" a song that would never see the light of public release. This was due to the addition of \"Gravity,\" a Coldplay-penned composition that Chris Martin (good friend of Danny McNamara) gifted to Embrace after Martin decided that the song sounded a bit more like Embrace than it did Coldplay. \"Everytime I See Your Face\" was dropped from the album, and \"Gravity\" not only found itself on Out of Nothing but also in the role of comeback single, being Independiente's preferred choice over \"Ashes,\" which had been the album's intended first single before the introduction of \"Gravity.\" Danny McNamara referred to this decision as the \"sexy angle.\" The last two songs on the album, \"Near Life\" and the title track, were Embrace's first attempts at songwriting as a band. The success the band experienced in this process led to their next album, This New Day, being almost entirely composed of full-band compositions."

Rubin had seen Cash perform at Bob Dylan's 30th anniversary concert in late 1992, and felt Cash was still a vital artist who had been unfairly written off by the music industry. Suffering from health problems and recovering from a relapse of his drug addiction, Cash was initially skeptical. The two men soon bonded, however, particularly when Rubin promised Cash a high level of creative control. Rubin told the singer: \"I would like you to do whatever feels right for you\", and Cash decided to record the first solo album of his career without any accompanying musicians. \"Sitting and talking and playing music\u2026 that was when we got to build up a friendship,\" Rubin recalled. \"My fondest memories are just of hanging out and hearing his stories. He didn't speak much but, if you drew him out, he seemed to know everything. He was shy and quiet but a wise, wise man.\""

        "content": "Under Rubin's supervision, Cash recorded most of the album in his own Tennessee cabin or Rubin's home in Los Angeles, accompanied only by his guitar. This was a return to Cash's earliest recording style. His first producer, Sam Phillips, had determined in the 1950s that Cash's voice was best suited to a stripped-down style and a three or four-piece ensemble (Cash on vocals and guitar, backed with another guitarist and upright bass, and sometimes drums). Subsequent producers deviated from this style with more ornate backing; Cash disagreed with Jack Clement in the 1960s when the producer tried to give Cash's songs a fashionable \"twangy\" feel and to add frills like orchestral string sections and barbershop quartet-style backup singers. In his autobiography, Cash wrote about his frustration with Columbia Records in the 1970s and 1980s, due in part to creative disagreements, such as recording his vocals separately from the backing musicians. \"Tennessee Stud\" and \"The Man Who Couldn't Cry\" were recorded live at the Viper Room, a Sunset Strip, Los Angeles nightclub owned at the time by Johnny Depp. \"The Beast in Me\" was written and originally recorded by Cash's former stepson-in-law Nick Lowe. Rubin commissioned new songs from several musicians, two of which ended up on American Recordings. \"Down There By The Train\" was a spiritual or gospel style song of redemption by Tom Waits. \"Thirteen\" was a more ominous composition by Glenn Danzig, whose heavy metal band had earlier worked with Rubin; Danzig wrote the song specifically for Cash in less than twenty minutes. Two songs on the album had been recorded by Cash previously: \"Delia's Gone\", for the 1962 album The Sound of Johnny Cash and \"Oh, Bury Me Not\", for 1965's Johnny Cash Sings the Ballads of the True West. The album cover was photographed while Cash was visiting Australia, at Werribee near Melbourne."

Q magazine deemed it the year's most sincere and ambitious record, while NME found it \"uplifting and life affirming because the message is taught through adversity, ill luck and fighting for survival\". David Browne, writing in Entertainment Weekly, said Cash remained a captivating singer throughout the austerely arranged country ballads and bizarre reflections, calling the record \"his most relaxed and folkiest album in three decades\". In a rave review in Rolling Stone, Anthony DeCurtis hailed it as one of Cash's greatest albums because of his self-possessed, \"biblically intense\" take on traditional folk songs and Rubin's no-frills production: \"American Recordings is at once monumental and viscerally intimate, fiercely true to the legend of Johnny Cash and entirely contemporary.\" Mark Cooper from Mojo called it a \"breathtaking blend of the confessional and the self-mythologising\". In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot wrote that Cash's singing was effectively dramatic throughout \"the quagmire of humor and bloodshed, pathos and treachery evoked by these songs\", while Los Angeles Times critic Randy Lewis said they \"peer into the dark corners of the American soul\" on what was a \"milestone work\" for Cash. In a negative review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau felt American Recordings had been overhyped by antisocial sycophants and lacked the vital shuffle beat of Cash's best music, citing \"Delia's Gone\" and perhaps \"Thirteen\" as \"the only time words and voice combine with the undeniable seniority his claque claims to hear everywhere\". In retrospect, AllMusic's Mark Deming wrote that the album \"became a critical sensation and a commercial success, though it was overrated in some quarters simply because it reminded audiences that one of America's greatest musical talents was still capable of making compelling music, something he had never stopped doing even if no one bothered to listen.\" At the end of 1994, American Recordings was voted the seventh best album of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide. In other year-end lists, it was ranked 36th by Select, 23rd by NME, 19th by Rockdelux, 17th by Les Inrockuptibles, 15th by The Face, 5th by the Los Angeles Times, 4th by Mojo, and 2nd by OOR. At the 1995 Grammy Awards, it won Cash a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Rolling Stone later placed the record at number 366 on the magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and Country Music Television (CMT) ranked it number 27 on the network's list of the top 40 greatest country albums in its 2006 list."

As a result of trying to muster as much emotion as possible, Grohl broke down during the recording of the vocal take which ended up being used in the final mix. This version also utilizes the addition of a piano part during the bridge, performed by Harrison.

This was the final album that drummer Terry Chambers appeared on with XTC, as he quit the group during the recording sessions, frustrated with the band's decision to becoming a solely studio-based act; he was replaced by Peter Phipps. Andy Partridge later said, \"Until early 1982, our work was like black-and-white TV. Mummer was the first in full colour\u2014bright sky blue.\""

Its U.S. release was initially scheduled for 26 May 1983 by Epic Records (it was even assigned a catalog number: BFE 38516), but the label thought it was too acoustic and pastoral for American audiences. It was finally issued in the U.S. by Geffen Records (who subsequently issued all of XTC's Virgin releases) in February 1984. \"Wonderland\" was the only single issued by Geffen from the album. The only promotional public appearance made by the band for this album was in late 1983, when they appeared on the BBC-TV show Pebble Mill at One, where they lip-synced to \"Love on a Farmboy's Wages\". A promotional video was made for the \"Wonderland\" single, and five more videos were made in July 1983 for the television documentary program Play at Home."

Describing the song in an interview to Marisa Lira, of the newspaper Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias, Barroso said that he wanted to \"free the samba away from the tragedies of life, of the sensual scenario already so explored\". According to the composer, he \"felt all the greatness, the value and the wealth of our land\", reliving \"the tradition of the national panels\". Initially, he wrote the first chords, which he defined as \"vibrant\", and a \"plangent of emotions\". The original beat \"sang on [his] imagination, highlighting the sound of the rain, on syncope beats of fantastic tambourins\". According to him, \"the rest came naturally, music and lyrics at once\". He declared to have felt like another person after writing the song."

It was then recorded by Francisco de Morais Alves, arranged by Radam\u00e9s Gnattali and his orchestra, and released by Odeon Records in August 1939. It was also recorded by Araci Cortes, but despite the singer's huge popularity at the time, the song was not a success, perhaps because the song was not adjusted to her tenor voice. \"Aquarela do Brasil\" took a while to succeed. In 1940, it was not among the top three songs of that year's Carnival in Rio. The president of the jury was Heitor Villa-Lobos, and Barroso, offended that his masterpiece was not on the list, ended his relationship with him. The two men would only speak to each other again fifteen years later, when both received the National Order of Merit. The song only became famous after it was included in Walt Disney's 1942 animated film Saludos Amigos, sung by Alo\u00edsio de Oliveira. After that, the song became known not only in Brazil, but worldwide, becoming the first Brazilian song to be played over a million times on American radio. Due to the huge popularity achieved in the United States, it received an English version by songwriter Bob Russell. It was voted by the Brazilian edition of Rolling Stone as the 12th greatest Brazilian song."

        "content": "This song, because of its exaltation of Brazil's great qualities, marked the creation of a new genre within samba, known as  (exaltation samba). This musical movement, with its extremely patriotic nature, was seen by many as being favorable to the dictatorship of Get\u00falio Vargas, which generated criticism towards Barroso and his work, as if he were kowtowing to the regime. The Barroso family, however, strongly denies these claims, pointing out that he also wrote an anti-Nazi song named \"Salada Mista\" (Mixed salad), recorded by Carmen Miranda in October 1938. Vargas, although not a fascist himself, was as sympathetic to such regimes in the early years of his presidency as the European governments of the time. The Department of Press and Propaganda, the official censorship body of the regime, wanted to censor the verse \"terra do samba e do pandeiro\" (\"land of samba and the pandeiro\"), which was seen as being \"derogatory\" for Brazil's image. Barroso persuaded the censors to keep the line. Some criticism to the song, at the time, was that it used expressions little known by the general public, such as \"inzoneiro\", \"merenc\u00f3ria\", and \"trigueiro\" (intriguing, melancholic, and swarthy), and that he was too redundant in the verses \"meu Brasil brasileiro\" (\"my Brazilian Brazil\") and \"esse coqueiro que d\u00e1 coco\" (\"this coconut palm that produces coconut\"). The composer defended his work, saying that these expressions were poetic effects inseparable from the original composition. On the original recording, Alves sang \"mulato risoneiro\" (laughing mulatto) instead of \"inzoneiro\" because he was unable to understand Barroso's illegible handwriting."

It is one of the 20 most recorded songs of all time. In 1943, Spanish-born bandleader Xavier Cugat reached number two on the Best Sellers List and number nine on the Harlem Hit Parade with his version of \"Brazil\". Django Reinhardt recorded \"Brazil\" three times between 1947 and 1953. In 1957, Frank Sinatra recorded the song in Come Fly With Me. He was followed by other successful artists of the time such as Bing Crosby, Ray Conniff, and Paul Anka. During the Brazilian military dictatorship, MPB singer Elis Regina performed what is perhaps the darkest version ever of \"Aquarela do Brasil\", accompanied by a chorus of men reproducing chants of the Native Brazilians. In 1975, American band The Ritchie Family reached number-one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart for seven weeks and number eleven Pop with their disco version of the song.Other successful Brazilian singers such as Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim, Erasmo Carlos, Jo\u00e3o Gilberto (with Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, and Maria Beth\u00e2nia), Gal Costa, and Simone also recorded versions of the song at the same period. The song was featured prominently in Terry Gilliam's 1985 film Brazil, which was named after it. It was recorded by Geoff Muldaur for the soundtrack, but parts of the song were also incorporated throughout the orchestral score by Michael Kamen, including a Kate Bush version. Afterwards, in the 1990s, it was recorded by both Harry Belafonte and Dionne Warwick. In 2007, singer-songwriter Daniela Mercury, which recorded the most recent cover of the song by a Brazilian artist, was invited to perform the song at the end of the opening ceremony of the XV Pan American Games, held in Rio de Janeiro. In 2009, the Recording Academy added the 1942 recording of \"Brazil (Aquarela do Brasil)\" by Jimmy Dorsey & His Orchestra, released as Decca 18460B, to the Grammy Hall of Fame.  Jimmy Dorsey was the first to record the song on July 14, 1942, and release it with the English lyrics by Bob Russell sung by Bob Eberly and Helen O'Connell. Also in 2009, American band Beirut performed \"Brazil\" for their live DVD Beirut: Live At The Music Hall Of Williamsburg. ITV used a cover of this song by Thiago Thom\u00e9 as the theme song for their coverage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup which took place in Brazil in June and July 2014. During the tournament's opening ceremony, its first verses were performed live by Brazilian singer Claudia Leitte before being joined onstage by Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez to sing \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\"."

The group's version of the song was produced by Smokey Robinson. The song is written in the first person, from the point of view of someone who has \"laid such a tender trap\" to catch a lover. Lead singer Wanda Young-Rogers (wife of Miracles member Bobby Rogers) talks about how she had been stalking her lover, having to learn his \"ways and habits\" so she could plan how to catch him. But \"certain things rearrange\" and she finds herself caught, presumably, in love with her 'game.' There seems to be 3 variations issued. The original mono single ended cold, yet some (not all) of the stereo remixes fade at the end. There is also a different last verse on some of the reissues, leading to the assumption that Smokey recorded the song much longer than any of the issued versions. Additionally, the single version and at least one of the stereo mixes exclude the first part of the second verse. Billboard named the song #71 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time."

Written by Miracles members Smokey Robinson, Bobby Rogers, and Pete Moore and produced by Robinson, the song was a top 20 pop hit in the United States, and a top 5 hit on the R&B charts. An extension of the theme from the group's #1 hit \"My Girl\", which had been released the previous December, \"My Baby\" features The Temptations, with David Ruffin on lead, bragging about the qualities of a special lady. Ruffin praises his woman's hairstyles (\"hair soft like a baby lamb/and I love to run my fingers through it\") and personality (\"the gold in her personality/could set Fort Knox to shame\"), and hopes that \"she digs me the way I am/but if I have to change/you know I'm gona do it for my baby\". Cash Box described the single as an \"easy-going, pop-r&b romantic shuffler about a love-sick fella who\u2019ll do anything for his girlfriend.\"  \"My Baby\" was a notable attempt to create an uptempo danceable number for the Temptations; all of their previous Top 20 hits to this point had been either ballads or mid-tempo numbers. The single immediately following \"My Baby\", \"Get Ready\", followed the same plan, and was produced with an even faster tempo and a brassier arrangement. Unusually for Temptations singles, \"My Baby's\" B-side, the Paul Williams-led \"Don\u2019t Look Back\", was a minor hit in its own right, becoming a top 20 R&B hit and serving for several years as the Temptations' live-show closing number. Both sides of the single would be remixed for its 2nd pressing, adding on the following statements: \"Taken from the album #G 914 The Temptin' Temptations.\""

In Lethal Weapon 2, Riggs discovers that South African crime lord Arjen Rudd, whom he and Murtaugh are pursuing, ordered Riggs's death in 1984. Rudd's enforcer, Pieter Vorstedt, killed Victoria Riggs by mistake and made the murder look like an automobile accident to cover up their involvement. After avenging the deaths of his wife and Rika van den Haas (whom Riggs had become involved with romantically before she, too, was murdered by Rudd and his minions), he is able to move on with his life. Meanwhile, Riggs and Murtaugh are assigned to protect a comical federal witness, Leo Getz, (played by Joe Pesci) whom they ultimately become close friends with. He meets Sgt. Lorna Cole (played by Rene Russo), an internal affairs officer, in Lethal Weapon 3 during an investigation into the disappearance of weapons from LAPD impound. The two make an immediate connection and work closely together to clear Murtaugh's name after he is forced to kill his son's friend in self-defense. Riggs and Cole become romantically involved and move in together after the end of the film. In Lethal Weapon 4, Riggs and Cole are still living together, and she is pregnant with their child, but they have dodged the issue of marriage. Both Riggs and Murtaugh are promoted to captain by the fourth film in order to keep them out of trouble, but are demoted back to sergeants at the end of the film. Leo helps Riggs finally make peace with his wife's death; Riggs marries Cole while she is giving birth to their son."

        "content": "Wow! (stylised in all caps) is the fourth studio album by English group Bananarama, released on 4 September 1987 by London Records. The album was entirely produced and co-written with the Stock Aitken Waterman production trio. Tensions between group member Siobhan Fahey and Stock, Aitken and Waterman regarding songwriting input and lyrical content (particularly with the track \"Strike It Rich\") prompted Fahey's departure from Bananarama five months after its release. By the time the album's fourth single, \"I Want You Back\", was released in March 1988, Fahey had been replaced with Jacquie O'Sullivan, who re-recorded the vocals for the single version of the song. Fahey would resurface later in 1988 with her new band, Shakespears Sister. The album reached number 26 on the UK Albums Chart and number 44 on the US Billboard 200, while peaking at number one in Australia. The album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 3 February 1988. Wow! was reissued in 2013 as a three-disc deluxe edition, including \"Reason for Living\", which is an early version of \"I Want You Back\"."

        "content": "Puzzle People is the eleventh studio album released by American soul quintet The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label in 1969. Produced entirely by Norman Whitfield, Puzzle People takes the next step along the path that Cloud Nine started, and takes the Temptations further away from a classic soul sound, and more towards the realm of psychedelic soul. Although a few ballads, including \"Running Away (Ain't Gonna Help You)\", are still present, the album is primarily composed of Sly & the Family Stone/James Brown-derived proto-funk tracks such as the lead single \"Don't Let the Joneses Get You Down\", and the number-one Billboard Pop hit \"I Can't Get Next to You\". Also included are psychedelic-styled covers (recorded with distorted guitars, clavinets, and spacy reverb and sound effects) of contemporary songs such as The Isley Brothers' \"It's Your Thing\", The Beatles' \"Hey Jude\", and Roger Miller's \"Little Green Apples\". As opposed to the recordings of the David Ruffin/\"Classic 5\" era, the lead vocals here are frequently traded back and forth between the group members, with each of the two singles featuring all five Temptations on lead, and Dennis Edwards, Eddie Kendricks, and Paul Williams dominating most of the leads on the album tracks. The lyrics on some of the original numbers, written by former Motown artist Barrett Strong, were becoming increasingly socially conscious and political. \"Slave\" deals with the injustice in the prison system, while \"Message From a Black Man\" is a Black power song with a militant refrain: \"no matter how hard you try/you can't stop me now.\" \"Message From a Black Man\" was a popular radio request in 1969, although the Temptations themselves, who thought the record too forward, never performed it live. Puzzle People was released on the same day (September 23, 1969) as Together, a duets album of covers by the Temptations and labelmates Diana Ross & the Supremes.  It peaked into the Top 5 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, and spent fifteen weeks at number one on the R&B Albums chart."

        "content": "\"Helpless\" is a song written by Canadian singer-songwriter Neil Young, recorded by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY) on their 1970 album D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. \"Helpless\" was originally recorded with Young's band Crazy Horse in early 1969, before Young's new CSNY bandmates (he had joined the then-trio in mid-1969) convinced him it would suit them better. The song was simple, at its core effectively the repetition of one melody over a descending D-A-G chord progression. The group found difficulty deciding on an arrangement, and many different versions of the song were recorded before the group finally decided on the slow-paced version that appeared on the album. On this final version Young was in the foreground, singing the verses and the chorus with his bandmates providing the \"helpless\" refrain, while the instrumentation came in the form of acoustic guitar, electric guitar (with volume pedal and tremolo), piano, bass and drums. It became one of the most revered songs from the D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu album (Q magazine's Peter Doggett regards it as \"one of (the album's) showpieces\"), and has remained a live favorite of Young's for over forty years.  An alternate mix of the CSNY version was released on Neil Young's The Archives Vol. 1 1963\u20131972. It features Young playing harmonica and electronically treated percussion. Young played the song with The Band in the group's final concert with its original lineup, on American Thanksgiving Day 1976 at San Francisco's Winterland Ballroom, with Joni Mitchell providing backing vocals offstage. The performance was featured in the Martin Scorcese concert film The Last Waltz. The \"town in North Ontario\" referred to in the opening line of the song is often presumed to be Ontario native Young's hometown; Young himself cleared up the rumors in a 1995 Mojo interview with Nick Kent: \"Well, it's not literally a specific town so much as a feeling. Actually, it's a couple of towns. Omemee, Ontario, is one of them. It's where I first went to school and spent my 'formative' years. Actually I was born in Toronto...\" Omemee lies just west of Peterborough and 128\u00a0km (approx. 80 miles) northeast of Toronto."

        "content": "The album was produced by organist Matthew Fisher, formerly Trower's bandmate in Procol Harum. Acclaimed Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick was this album's sound engineer. In an interview with Guitar World, Trower explained how the album got its title. Robin said that he had had the first line of the song for years and one day saw some sport pages which listed a racehorse called Bridge of Sighs, which he thought would be a great title. One can safely assume that the horse was named after the well-known structure of the same name that is in Venice, Italy -- unquestionably, the bridge predated the horse by centuries. Bridge of Sighs (Chrysalis 1057) reached #7 in the United States during a chart stay of 31 weeks. It was certified Gold on 10 September 1974. Early printings of the original album cover had the front image upside-down and were more greenish in colour. The title track was covered by Opeth for the special edition of their 2008 album, Watershed. Steve Lukather covered it for his 2021 album, I Found the Sun Again. A segment of it also appears as a hidden track on Metallica's 1998 cover album Garage Inc. \"Day of the Eagle\" was covered by Billy Idol guitarist Steve Stevens on his third solo album Memory Crash (2008). Tesla also covered the song on their 2007 Real to Reel album as did Armored Saint on their Nod to the Old School record. \"Too Rolling Stoned\" was covered by UFO on their 2017 covers album The Salentino Cuts."

The band then received a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist of 1987. Despite all this, however, contemporary reception to the album was mixed from critics and muted commercially. Both the album and the band have been looked upon more positively in hindsight. In a retrospective review, Michael Sutton of AllMusic gave the album four stars. He said the album \"never deserved the hacking [it] received from critics\", and said that \"the slick guitar rock on Broadcast may not have wowed the rock & roll intelligentsia, but it's a guaranteed crowd-pleaser, an underrated collection of simple, heartfelt love songs and up-tempo pop that reside between the stylistic boundaries of new wave and mainstream rock.\" He concludes the review by saying the album \"is not a creative breakthrough\", but is \"simply an LP absent of any filler.\" In the early '90s, the first seven tracks were included in the compilation album The Best of Cutting Crew, along with select songs from the follow-up album The Scattering and the single \"If That's the Way You Want It\" from Compus Mentus. The band's second compilation album, Ransomed Healed Restored Forgiven, released in 2020, features orchestral versions of the four singles spanned from Broadcast, plus the title track, this one in a version half the length of the original incarnation."

He has approached them with affection, but as music to be played in his style.

The lyric \"wasting all my time-time\" is a reference to \"Sister Ray\" by the Velvet Underground, a band Ocasek credited as one of his favorites. The song was sung by the Cars' bassist Benjamin Orr, in a performance that Ultimate Classic Rock described as \"perfect.\" In 2003, pop rock band Fountains of Wayne would in turn copy the Cars' take on the riff for their song \"Stacy's Mom\". This prompted Ric Ocasek to say the opening was a sample; however, the band has insisted they \"got it right\"."

Rolling Stone named the song one of Ocasek's \"essential songs\", praising the \"chugging eighth-note guitars marching along in crisp perfection\" in the song. Ultimate Classic Rock named the song the best Cars song as well as the best Benjamin Orr Cars song, saying \"On a near-perfect debut album, the Roy Thomas Baker-produced \"Just What I Needed\" was a near-perfect song.\" The site also ranked it the 35th best classic rock song of all time.  The song was also ranked among the band and Ocasek's best by The New York Times, NME, Esquire, and Inquisitr.

She stops the dog from barking by throwing him a bone and then exits the house. She grabs her backpack, which she had thrown out from the window in her room, and jumps in the backseat of her friends' car. She and her friends then go to a club, and they are able to skip the line by showing the bouncer a beeper that reads \"AM to PM.\" She and her friends then proceed into the club and start to dance. They all dance and Christina dances on a stage with many background dancers. After Christina and her friends leave, she attempts to sneak back into her house. Her dad is reading the newspaper and the dog is barking again. She sees this and then runs around to enter the house through the backdoor. She sprints to her room and dives into her bed. Her dad checks on her, thinking that she's asleep, and she pretends to be. After he leaves, Christina says \"from AM to PM,\" and the video ends.

I was not a well budgie, I was married and it was just one bag of coke after another.\" (In spite of this, lyricist Bernie Taupin believes The Big Picture deserves the honour of worst album.) In 2000, Gus Dudgeon said: \"There was a chance he could polish himself off. He'd go out and do some coke and it'd be all over his mouth, his nose would be running and I'd go: 'Oh God, this is just awful'.\" John has also stated in his 2019 autobiography Me that \"it was about as close to an unmitigated disaster than anything I've ever released\" and \"overall, Leather Jackets had four legs, a tail, and barked if a postman came to the door\". \"Heartache All Over the World\" was the only single to achieve chart success in the US, though it failed to crack the top 50. \"Slow Rivers\" is a collaboration with Cliff Richard that was released as a single in the UK. Cher collaborated with \"Lady Choc Ice\" (actually John himself) to write \"Don't Trust That Woman\". Roger Taylor and John Deacon of Queen play drums and bass guitar respectively on the track \"Angeline\"; songwriting credit is shared with backup singer Alan Carvell, who composed the \"oh-oh-oh's\" that can be heard at the beginning and end of the track. John played \"Paris\" during his 1986 US tour. He included \"Heartache All Over the World\" and \"Slow Rivers\" on his 1986 Australian tour with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, which would eventually yield John's live album Live in Australia with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. \"Heartache\" was included in the band portion of the show (John opted not to play piano for that number) while \"Slow Rivers\" was played during the second half of the show with the orchestra. Due to contractual constraints, \"Slow Rivers\" was not included on Live in Australia, despite the fact that it was from the orchestral portion of the show, which was the basis for the album. Though not released as a single, \"Paris\" also became a minor FM hit for some jazz stations that programmed the track. This is John's only studio album from the pre-1993 period that has yet to be remastered as of 2019; it last appeared on compact disc in the early 1990s. However, in 2008, it became available for digital download. It also his fourth album from the 1980s behind The Fox, Jump Up!, and Breaking Hearts that  don't have any bonus tracks."

It was released on November 23, 1992 as the fifth single from the album. It was written and composed by Jackson, and produced by Jackson and Bruce Swedien. It is a song steeped with antiwar lyrics and Jackson's wish for humanity of making the world a better place. In a 2001 Internet chat with fans, Jackson said that \"Heal the World\" is the song he was most proud to have created. He also created the Heal the World Foundation, a charitable organization which was designed to improve the lives of children. The organization was also meant to teach children how to help others. This concept of 'betterment for all' would become a centerpiece for the Dangerous World Tour. In the documentary Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson said he created the song in his \"Giving Tree\" at Neverland Ranch. An ensemble performance of \"We Are the World\" and \"Heal the World\" closed Jackson's memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on July 7, 2009. The song was performed as rehearsed by Jackson at the venue just weeks earlier, in preparation for his planned \"This Is It\" concerts in London along with \"Dirty Diana\". R&B singer Ciara sang the song as a tribute to Jackson at the 2009 BET Awards. The song was played at the funeral of James Bulger, and Jackson also donated the song to be used as the anthem for the James Bulger Red Balloon Centre, a school for children to go to if they are being bullied or have learning difficulties."

The universal message is also the theme of his current world tour.\" After Jackson's death, the Daily Vault's Michael R. Smith wrote, \"Certainly, message songs like \"Heal the World\" and \"Gone Too Soon\" have a striking and sad resonance now that Jackson is no longer with us, so in that way his legacy is preserved and his music does live on.\" David Browne of Entertainment Weekly praised the song, \"And when his voice isn't competing with drum machines, it has rarely sounded stronger-achingly pure\".

        "title": "New Order discography_Summary",
        "content": "The discography of New Order, an English rock band, consists of 10 studio albums, 12 compilation albums, six live albums, five extended plays (EPs), 45 singles, 12 video releases, 40 music videos and a number of soundtrack appearances. New Order were formed in 1980 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The group began life as a continuation of their former incarnation Joy Division. Joy Division had disbanded after the death of the lead singer Ian Curtis. Gillian Gilbert, who was Morris' girlfriend at the time, soon joined the group and played guitar and keyboards. Remarkably, New Order's first eight singles released between 1981 and 1984 were not taken from any album. In most cases they were not even released as a 7-inch, but exclusively available in the radio-unfriendly 12-inch format, an unusual approach for a pop-act in the eighties. Despite the high anticipation that surrounded the group, their debut single \"Ceremony\" only peaked at number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The group's following two singles and their debut album met with similar moderate success. It would not be until the release of their fourth single, \"Blue Monday\", that New Order would break into the top 10, with the song peaking at number 9. \"Blue Monday\" became a defining single for the group and caused a sensation, becoming the biggest selling 12-inch single of all time. New Order, like many other post-punk groups of the period, increasingly utilised keyboards, drum machine and sequencers in their music. As a result, they became associated with the synthpop and electronic dance movements of the 1980s. Beginning with Power, Corruption & Lies from 1983, all of the group's studio albums reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The group experienced a lull in popularity in the years 1985 and 1986 but the surprise international popularity of the \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" single re-launched the group across the world. The group cemented their success in 1987 with the single, \"True Faith\", and the compilation album Substance. New Order were at the peak of their popularity in the years 1987 to 1993, with a run of popular singles, including \"Blue Monday 1988\", \"Fine Time\", \"Regret\", \"World (The Price of Love)\" and in 1990 they scored their only number 1 single in the UK with the official England national football team song, \"World in Motion\". The two albums released during these years, Technique and Republic; each charted at number 1 in the UK. It was during this successful period that the group's internal dynamic began to falter. Sumner was not fond of touring, and wanted to take time off from the group and produce a solo album. He formed Electronic with Johnny Marr and the pair released their first single in 1989. Hook formed his own band, Revenge, in 1989, while Morris and Gilbert worked together as The Other Two, primarily scoring soundtracks. Of the three side projects, Sumner's was by far the most successful. The recording and touring of 1993's Republic, their first for London Records, was difficult and intra-band tensions were rife. The group went on hiatus until 1998. In the meantime two compilation albums, The Best of New Order and The Rest of New Order, and several singles were released. The group reconvened in 1998 for the Reading Festival but did not release new material until 2000. The group released the album Get Ready in 2001. It was met with critical warmth, but it was apparent that the group's popularity had lessened. The lead single from the album, \"Crystal\", reached the top 10 in the UK. The film 24 Hour Party People, a humorous chronicle of their label Factory Records, was released in 2002. New Order contributed a new song, \"Here to Stay\", and a re-recording of the Joy Division song \"New Dawn Fades\" with Moby, for the film's soundtrack. The compilation International and four-disc boxset Retro were released in winter 2002. New Order followed Get Ready with Waiting for the Sirens' Call in 2005. During this period Gilbert stepped down from live performances due to family commitments. Phil Cunningham stepped into her role and in 2005 became an official member of the group. The group had intended to release a ninth album soon after Waiting for the Sirens' Call, the majority of which had already been recorded. The lack of enthusiasm inside the group and relative failure of Waiting for the Sirens' Call stalled their career momentum. In 2007, Hook decided to leave the group, and stated that he and Sumner had no further plans to work together. Sumner formed Bad Lieutenant with Cunningham, and Hook formed Freebass. Morris continued to work with Sumner and Cunningham. In 2008, New Order released remastered and expanded editions of their first five albums with the intention of releasing the further three albums in a similar format in the future. Lost Sirens was released in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2013. It is an eight-track album of tracks left out of Waiting for the Sirens' Call. On 25 September 2015, the band released a new album, Music Complete. The album was the first without Peter Hook, and was produced mostly by the band themselves, except \"Singularity\" and \"Unlearn This Hatred\", both produced by Tom Rowlands, while \"Superheated\" features additional production by Stuart Price. In 2020, New Order released \"Be a Rebel\", their first non-album single since \"Here to Stay\" in 2002. In the US, the band has sold a certified 2 million albums, and in the UK a certified 1.24 million albums."

The song was written by Twain and her then-husband Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange. \"Party for Two\" was recorded as both a pop mix with Mark McGrath and a country mix with Billy Currington. The song was released to country, adult contemporary, and mainstream pop radio formats, as well as European and other international markets. \"Party for Two\" was a commercial success for Twain: it was her third highest debut and sixteenth career top 10 on the Billboard country charts, and charted well in Europe. In addition to the original pop and country mixes, the song would be remixed for club play, becoming one of her most remixed singles. Commercial singles were released on October 25, 2004, in Germany, on November 2, 2004, in Canada, and on November 22, 2004, in the UK. In 2005, \"Party for Two\" was certified Gold by the RIAA for selling over 100,000 digital downloads, making it Twain's first single to be downloaded that many times. For the first time in her touring career, Twain performed \"Party for Two\" on her 2015 Rock This Country Tour. She has since performed the song on her Now Tour and Let's Go! residency."

Greener said, \"It sounded a bit too lovely, which is why we made it louder towards the end, we wanted to mess it up a bit.\" It was inspired by the surreal David Lynch horror film Eraserhead, in which the main character Henry Spencer watches and listens to the Lady in the Radiator sing about finding happiness in heaven. \"Be All You Want Me to Be\" was credited by Chris Martin as being inspiration for Coldplay's third album, X&Y. He said in NME, \"I heard one of their songs called 'Be All You Want Me To Be' and I said, 'Fuck, that's better than most, no all, of our songs', and then it made us write a whole bunch of new tunes.\" Morning Runner supported Coldplay on some of their Twisted Logic Tour dates. The song was at one point considered not to be album material. \"It's quite full-on and bold\", stated pianist Chris \"Fields\" Wheatcroft, \"We did struggle with where to put it on the album.\" However, it was decided that the song would be on the album \"to bring it back up again\", following the track \"The Great Escape\". \"Punching Walls\" was the first song that the band wrote.  A demo version of the song was a B-side to 2006 single \"Oceans\". \"Work\" was written following Greener's father being made redundant."

Initially planned for release in November 1992, the album was finally released on CD, vinyl and cassette on January 15, 1993 through Lookout Records. Due to a \"cymbal hissing\" in the original vinyl version, the album was remixed and re-released soon afterwards. After the band's popularity had grown with their previous album My Brain Hurts, the group felt pressured with the follow-up album. While most of Wiggle is in a similar vein to their previous album, some songs saw the band experimenting with new wave and a few featured a more hardcore-influenced sound reminiscent of the group's earlier material. In retrospect, vocalist Ben Weasel has voiced dissatisfaction with the album, mainly the songs that were chosen for it. However, he considers the band's performance and the album's production better than My Brain Hurts. The album was remastered and reissued by Asian Man Records in 2005 shortly after the band had removed its catalog from Lookout due to unpaid royalties and a vinyl version was released by Recess Records in 2009."

In February 1992, the band went to engineer Steve Albini's house in Chicago to record demos for their next album, with Albini serving as engineer and Naked Raygun drummer Eric Spicer producing.

The band recorded several songs during the sessions, including the non-album single \"Radio Blast\" and its b-side \"The Girl Next Door\", a re-working of the song \"Cindy's on Methadone\" titled \"Shirley's on Methadone\" for a film called Shirley Pimple (which was never released as the director ended up in prison) and a cover of the song \"Achtung\" by the band The Authorities for a tribute album (which was also never released). Another song from the session, \"Amy Saw Me Looking at Her Boobs\", originated as a composition by Joe King (Joe Queer) of The Queers from 1990 that Weasel finished. The song was later re-worked by The Queers as \"Fuck the World\" on their album Love Songs for the Retarded, which Screeching Weasel also recorded a version of. Weasel later called the sessions for the album an \"enormous pain in the ass\" due to the long recording process and that he \"wasn't singing like [him]self\", saying his vocals on the album were \"horrible.\" He also stated that he was having relationship problems with his girlfriend at the time of the recording, which resulted in \"fucking up [his] head\" and having \"no idea what should go on the album and what shouldn't.\""

It is a remix with some additional melodic variations of the song \"Rectangle\" by the French musician Jacno, which doesn't originally contain any vocals. Music producer and songwriter Carlo Montagner provides the vocals, which were heavily auto-tuned, as were many songs which followed Cher's trend during the early 2000s. D'Agostino has made various mixes for different albums. The song was a hit in Austria and Belgium, where it became a number 1 single."

The video then goes into a flashback at the end that again shows D'Agostino in the music store, which means that the story continues in an infinite loop."

Dawn, released in August 1991 as the second single from their debut album, Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience (1991). It is built around samples of Spandau Ballet's \"True\", The Soul Searchers' \"Ashley's Roachclip\", and the Bob James version of Paul Simon's \"Take Me to the Mardi Gras\", with the remainder of the song written by P.M. Dawn vocalist Attrell \"Prince Be\" Cordes; only Prince Be and \"True\" writer Gary Kemp were credited for writing the tune. The song was P.M. Dawn's first (and only) number-one hit on the US Billboard Hot 100, and it was the first number-one song after the debut of the Nielsen SoundScan system, which monitored airplay and sales more closely than before, when Billboard had to rely on manual sales reports and airplay data. According to the test charts of the SoundScan system, \"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\" was at number one for at least three weeks but officially has a one-week reign at number one. Worldwide, it reached number one in New Zealand, number three in the United Kingdom and number seven in Australia. It was ranked number 81 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop. And Blender ranked it at number 94 in their list of Greatest Songs Since You Were Born in 2005. A slower, ballad version of the song was remade for the Backstreet Boys, and recorded on their second international album, Backstreet's Back, and released on their US debut album."

Dawn, if you're like me, you were hooked the first time you heard the pop-infused brilliance of \"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\".\" Steve Huey from AllMusic described it as a \"shimmering\" ballad. Another editor, Hal Horowitz said it is an \"amazingly mature debut tune\". Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report wrote, \"Hypnotic rap from New Jersey brothers Prince Be and DJ Minutemix set to Spandau Ballet's 1983 smash \"True\" not only brings back a memory or two, it's sure to create new ones. It has fresh production elements and a chorus with all the relaxing, calming qualities of a nice long massage. A massive hit overseas, it's set to become just as big in North America thanks to early airplay at key crossover outlets.\" Alan Jones from Music Week commented, \"A brilliant soundscape starts with some nice vocal work, followed by the drum track from Dennis Edwards' Don't Look Any Further before Spandau Ballet's True leads into a mellow rap. A serene summer smash.\" A reviewer from Newcastle Evening Chronicle described it as a \"dreamy rap song\". Johnny Dee from Smash Hits called it the \"dreamiest, most laid-back record ever invented.\" He added, \"Quite what lyrics like \"rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh\" mean is a total mystery, but if ever a record could be described as \u2014 aherm \u2014 like being massaged by a bag of marshmallows, then this is it. Melt city!\" While reviewing Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience, the magazine's Gary Kipper stated that the song \"is, of course, one of the most summery records ever made\"."

It was released in April 1980 by record label Factory as a  flexi disc intended to be given away free in select record shops. 75,000 copies were pressed. The tracks are outtakes from the recording session for the album Closer. The single's B-sides, \"Incubation\" and \"As You Said\", are both instrumentals. This was the final release from Joy Division before Ian Curtis's death in May 1980. \"Komakino\" and \"Incubation\" appear on the 1988 compilation Substance, and \"As You Said\" was added in the expanded reissue of the album in 2015 and in the B-side of New Order's Video 586 single. All three tracks are also collected on the 4-CD 1997 compilation Heart and Soul. The Komakino Site, also known as the Komakino Remains or the Komakino Stone Circle, is an ancient set of structures in Japan's Aomori Prefecture consisting of three rings of stones and a fourth, partial outer ring. There are no obvious parallels between the Joy Division song and the site, in any descriptive or literal sense. The name was used in 1979 for a German tape label apparently predating and perhaps inspiring Joy Division's title. It has since been used for an Italian fanzine, a number of groups, most prominently a German techno group active since 1989, and an avant-garde menswear shop in Vancouver, Canada."

The second edition was independently released. The album cover features a cartoon by Garth Kauffman on the cover and refers to the band as \"Fishtank Ensemble\". Besides purely aesthetic differences, there are significant differences between the sound quality of the releases. Though both of the CDs have the same tracks in the same order, the Mimicry pressing of Super Raoul is inferior to the quality of the independent pressing; notably so on the songs \"Hora di Bucharest/Hora de Fabrice\" and \"Suite Romaine\". On the Mimicry pressing, these songs \"skip\", then abruptly silence repeatedly. This is most likely due to an error in transferring the data of the tracks. On the second edition, these tracks do not have such problems. Though the first edition is technically inferior in quality, it is perhaps likely to become a collector's item. Many consumers who have purchased the first edition CD from CD Baby have been sent a replacement CD along with a short note of apology."

As Bergman describes it, \"We didn't fight. The group had really split apart; we had just burned out. I mean it was five years non-stop work. We would stop one album and start writing the next. Frankly, we didn't have five more albums in us at that point.\" Their last Columbia record was the 1976 \"greatest hits\" compilation Forward Into the Past, consisting of selections from their previous records. For their next album, they decided to take material from their 1970 Dear Friends and 1971\u201372 Let's Eat radio shows which aired on station KPFK FM in Los Angeles, and work it into some newly recorded material, overdubbing some of the existing material for continuity. The radio material had never been officially released on record as of 1976. The sketches are placed within the context of a TV news program airing in the fictional town of \"Ducktown.\" There is an ad included for \"Confidence in the System\" and also a trip to \"Jimmy Carterland\".

The parody depicts the four members of the Firesign Theatre similarly dressed in suits and hats like the original, but each wears a different tie. Phil Austin's hat is on fire; Philip Proctor is the only one with the crescent Moon above his head, and he is smoking a pipe. David Ossman's hat appears to be floating above his head. Peter Bergman smiles at the viewer; there is nothing unusual about his hat. The inner sleeve of the original vinyl LP contained an ad for an official Firesign Theatre belt buckle and T-shirt, reading \"Yes, dear bozos, you two  can have a remarkable T-shirt and/or cast iron belt buckle for a mere pittance\"."

Host \"Blend---Ben Bland\" comes off as utterly high, stoned, or perhaps senile, desperately trying to act straight, and unable to resist free association. He earnestly corrects errors in his public service announcements with even more errors: \"Just send ... to ... Barn C, Crabapple, Maryland; that's Born Free ... Marineland ...\" And in an eerily prescient ad, Ben Bland informs aliens that \"marrying an animal can mean citizenship for you; just listen to these success stories from your U.S. Animal Husbandry Service.\"  In David Ossman's memoir Fighting Clowns of Hollywood, he writes the following concerning the Ben Bland segments: The album ends with the track \"Pass the Indian, Please,\" a skit from several years earlier. Like the track \"Temporarily Humbolt County\" (sic) from Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him, it is concerned with the European expansion into North America and the displacement of the Native Americans. In 2002 The Firesign Theatre re-recorded the final track on this album, \"Pass the Indian, Please,\" for NPR's news program, All Things Considered. The NPR re-recording is included, with a few revisions, on their 2003 album All Things Firesign."

Virgins and Philistines contained all original material except \"The Hammond Song\" (a cover of The Roches song), and \"Can\u2019t Get Enough of You Baby\" (written by Linzer/Randell), which was the only track that received much airplay. The album was recorded at Strawberry Studios in Stockport (near Manchester) and was produced by Hugh Jones and Jeremy Green, and engineered by Chris Jones.

The second single, \"Thinking of You\", was much better received and returned Hall to the top forty in the UK and Ireland, reaching #12 and #11 respectively. \"Castles in the Air\" was the final single and directly preceded the album, but it only managed #51. The album was released in the US with different track listing including the band's self-titled d\u00e9but single. It also added the B-sides \"I Can't Get Enough of You Baby\", \"Pushing Up the Daisies\" and \"Your Love Was Smashing\". \"Armchair Theatre\" and \"Yours Sincerely\" were not included, but were later released in the US on the EP; The Colour Field. The album was released in Canada with the same track order as the US release.  Faint Hearts is a shorter 3:58 minute version that excludes the 20 second slow vocal introduction.  Another notable difference is the song titles: \"I Can't Get Enough of You Baby\" appears as \"Can't Get Enough Of You Baby\" and \"The Colour Field\" is listed as \"The Colourfield\". In 1999, the album was re-released in Japan with twenty tracks, including all of the songs on the UK and US versions of the album plus all of the singles, B-Sides and remixes that were released before and immediately after the original release of Virgins And Philistines.

Each member of the Velvet Underground has performed the song based on their own interpretations. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song at number 159 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was moved to number 161 in 2010, and finally re-ranked at number 81 in 2021.

        "content": "In December 1966, David Bowie's manager, Kenneth Pitt, acquired an acetate of the then-unreleased The Velvet Underground & Nico and presented it to Bowie. Upon hearing \"I'm Waiting for the Man\", he went to his band at the time, the Buzz, and told them they were going to learn it: \"We learned 'Waiting for the Man' right then and there and we were playing it on stage within a week.\" He later recalled in an 2003 interview with Vanity Fair: \"Amusingly, not only was I to cover a Velvets song before anyone else in the world, I actually did it before the album came out. Now that's the essence of Mod.\" Bowie first attempted to record \"I'm Waiting for the Man\" in the studio during the sessions for his 1967 debut album, and later properly recorded it with another band, the Riot Squad, on April 5, 1967. In his book Rebel Rebel, Chris O'Leary notes the subpar quality of the recording, writing that it \"sounded as if they were making do with what they'd found in a school music room.\" This version later appeared on the Riot Squad compilations The Last Chapter: Mods & Sods (2012) and The Toy Soldier EP. In this version, Bowie misinterpreted the song's subject matter, containing the line \"I'm just looking for a good friendly behind\" instead of \"I'm just looking for a dear, dear friend of mine\". Tony Visconti later told biographer Nicholas Pegg: \"A very young David Bowie didn't yet know that 'the man' in Harlem parlance meant the drug dealer. So he naturally assumed it was a gay encounter involving money.\" Bowie performed \"I'm Waiting for the Man\", often titled as \"Waiting for the Man\", for BBC radio shows in 1972 (one recording appearing on 2000's Bowie at the Beeb) and frequently on the Ziggy Stardust Tour (one recording appearing on 1994's Santa Monica '72). He would further perform it on the 1976 Isolar Tour and the 1990 Sound+Vision Tour. While his 1967 recording followed Reed's original chord structure, Bowie made subtle changes to his live performances. He performed the song with Reed at his 50th birthday bash in 1997. David Buckley writes that Bowie's 1977 song \"Heroes\" was influenced by Reed's writing."

He sings lead vocals and plays guitar on the album, backed by his Bon Jovi bandmates Tico Torres on drums and David Bryan on keyboards, joined by Tony Levin on bass guitar. Eric Clapton makes a guest appearance playing guitar on the track \"Mr. Bluesman\". \"Ballad of Youth\", \"One Light Burning\" and \"The Answer\" were co-written with colleagues from his former club band Shark Frenzy. \"Rosie\" was originally intended to be a Bon Jovi song for their fourth album \"New Jersey; versions of this song with the full Bon Jovi line-up have surfaced as bootlegs. \"Ballad of Youth\" was released as the lead single followed by the second single \"One Light Burning\". The album titled track, \"Stranger in This Town\" was released as the third single and \"Mr. Bluesman\" featuring Eric Clapton was released as a promo single. The first three singles were accompanied by music videos. The first radio promotional single was \"Church Of Desire\" in the United Kingdom. \"The Answer\" and \"Rosie\" were also released as promo singles in Japan. Occasionally, \"Stranger in This Town\" has been played by Sambora on Bon Jovi's tours, most recently on their Lost Highway Tour in 2008."

        "content": "\"Sweet Thing\" or \"Sweet Thing/Candidate/Sweet Thing (Reprise)\" is a suite of songs written by David Bowie for the album Diamond Dogs. Recorded in January 1974, the piece comprises the songs \"Sweet Thing\" and \"Candidate\" and a one-verse reprise of \"Sweet Thing.\" In the opening line, \"Sweet Thing\" contains the lowest note Bowie had recorded in a studio album (C2) until \"I Took a Trip on a Gemini Spacecraft\" for the album Heathen (2002), where he growled the word \"Well\" (G1) towards the end of the song. Bowie recorded a track with the same title, \"Candidate\" \u2013 but no musical similarity to the Diamond Dogs song \"Candidate\" and only a few words of lyrics in common \u2013 during the first several days of January 1974.  It was unavailable until 1990 when it was released as a bonus track on the Rykodisc reissue of Diamond Dogs; it also appeared on the bonus disc of the 30th Anniversary Edition of Diamond Dogs in 2004."

Incorporating parts reminiscent of \"Aladdin Sane\" and what would become \"Sweet Thing (Reprise)\" on Diamond Dogs, this instrumental piece was generally thought to have been recorded during the Aladdin Sane sessions at Trident Studios early in 1973. However a recent estimate places it alongside recordings for Pin Ups later that year, as a preview of Bowie's next original work, leading author Nicholas Pegg to suggest that it \"perhaps ought to be regarded more as a Diamond Dogs demo than an Aladdin Sane out-take\". A 1973 article about Bowie recording Pinups in France accurately describes the song, which seems to confirm Pegg's theory:"

        "content": "Following the release of his second album Wise After the Event in May 1978, Phillips started work on his next record which was to be an album of all fresh material. However, the writing sessions had Phillips in doubt as to whether his re-emergence as a recording artist in 1977 was at the right time, as his progressive style of music was becoming increasingly out of fashion. Phillips also had difficulty in deciding what musical direction to undertake, and saw little value in recording more folk and romantic-oriented music which he had done on his first album The Geese & the Ghost (1977) and Wise After the Event. His label, the US-based Passport Records, put pressure on him to deliver more radio friendly songs. During the preparation of the album's material, Phillips called upon producer and songwriter Rupert Hine and drummer Michael Giles to assist, both of whom had worked on Wise After the Event. Phillips was soon advised by Passport and his own management to include guest vocalists as they deemed his songwriting ability strong enough, but figured other singers would benefit the material in a commercial sense. Phillips was attracted to this idea as he lacked the confidence to handle all the lead vocals himself, and hired singers Dan Owen and Dale Newman, the latter once a member of the Genesis road crew. Before recording began, Phillips and the group rehearsed for two weeks at Farmyard Studios in Buckinghamshire. They completed some songs there, including \"Um & Aargh\" which was an easy track for them to put together, and \"Nightmare\". Recording began in October 1978 at Essex Studios in London. The best takes of each track were transferred to a 24-track master to allow room for overdubs and vocals, and it was decided to mix down the original 16-track recordings for four songs, \"Sisters of Remindum\", \"Bleak House\", \"Magdalen\", and \"Nightmare\", straight onto the master. Both masters were then synchronised during the mixing stage. Recording then moved to Matrix Studios in London, where engineering duties were overseen by Nick Bradford, and the overdubs were put down at Trident Studios. After completing a rough mix of \"Catch You When You Fall\", a proposed song for the album, Phillips was unsatisfied with the lyrics and left it off. It remained unreleased until Archive Collection Volume I in 1998. In December 1978, after preparing a master copy, President Records manager Marty Scott suggested that some tracks would benefit from a remix or added instrumentation. A final recording session was booked, whereby Collins played the saxophone on \"Side Door\" and the track was remixed, and \"Um & Aargh\" was changed. A final session took place at Pye Studios on 11 January 1979 where Morris Pert added percussion to \"Lucy Will\" and \"Nightmare\". Phillips wanted to name the album Balls in response to one comment that his songs \"didn't have 'enough balls'\", but was told that the title was \"too eccentric\", resulting in the change to Sides. This caused a problem with sleeve designer Peter Cross, his fourth cover for Phillips, as he had already completed the design."

As part of Voiceprint's re-issuing campaign of Phillips's back catalogue, the album was re-issued in 2010 as an expanded 2 CD edition. The album was re-mastered from the original master tapes by Simon Heyworth and includes the non-album track \"Souvenir\" as an extra track on the first CD. This is in keeping with the track order of the original CD release. The second CD contains variations and alternate mixes of the songs from the album including some unique new mixes which have been made from the original multi-track masters especially for the release. The instrumental version of \"Magdalen\", which appeared as bonus track at the end of the original CD issue, has been moved to the second disc of this release. Also included is the edited single version of \"Um & Aargh\" which has not previously been available on CD. The second CD also contains two tracks originally intended for inclusion on the original album. \"Catch You When You Fall\" was recorded for the album but was left off because Phillips was unhappy with the lyrics. A rough mix was included on Archive Collection Volume One, the version included on the bonus CD is newly mixed in instrumental form from the 24-track master. \"Before The Night\" was left off the album in place of \"Bleak House\" as it was decided to include only one piano-based ballad. On April 22, 2016, Esoteric Recordings (a Cherry Red Records label) released a 4-disc deluxe edition of the album.  Disc 1 contains a 2016 stereo remix of the album.  Disc 2 contains the bonus material (as on the 2010 release).  Disc 3 contains a remastered version of the original stereo mix of the album.

Justin Moran, while ranking Lohan's best music videos in Paper magazine, stated, \"In the video for angry rock-pop track \"Over,\" Lindsay stares at a neighbor boy from her bedroom window, wears too much black eye makeup, hooks up with said boy in a random trailer and cries... a lot. This video has a completely over-the-top dramatic ending with Lindsay doing donuts with the neighbor boy in a vintage car (amazing), only to be interrupted by his abusive father. Lindsay cries more, breaks through a window with her heel and shatters a lamp on the ground. Yes, Lindsay, yes. We love it when you're angry.\""

While she sang \"Over\" with no problems, her mouth was not moving for a second during the performance of \"Rumors\", leading the media to accuse her of lip synching. Lohan denied that she was lip synching, claiming that there was a backing track because she had fallen ill recently. Kim Jakwerth, of Casablanca Records, supported this statement by saying, \"Yes, on the first song there were background tracks, which were not on the second song.\" In addition to these performances, she sang the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on December 16. In January 2005, Lohan performed \"Over\" and \"Speak\" at Yahoo's Live@Launch, where she also gave an interview."

The guitar is not in standard tuning; rather, it is in \"Open E\" tuning. Lyrically, \"Buckets of Rain\" is relatively simple, with five short verses addressing a lover. Oliver Trager describes the song thus: Closing an otherwise desperate album with a light reappraisal of commitment, \"Buckets of Rain\" is a final, Sinatra-like tip of the hat sung with the playfulness of an old Piedmont songster. Though Dylan seems to liken the relationship he describes here with the ferocity of a deluge, he plaintively sings to his love, describing in light, sensual brushstrokes why he still finds her special. (88) The melody in fact is virtually identical to that of the 1972 song \"Seaside Shuffle\" written by English musician Jona Lewie and recorded that year under the band name \"Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs\" although the mood and style of the two songs are very different."

In an article accompanying the list, critic Jacob Nierenberg notes that, in spite of being known as the \"spokesman of a generation\", Dylan sounds on the song \"like a man who wants to be nothing more than a man, to process his emotions and remind himself of the things he loves about the woman he loves. 'I like your smile/ And your fingertips/ I like the way that you move your hips/ I like the cool way you look at me', Dylan croons\u2014a heartfelt sentiment from a man who isn\u2019t known for heartfelt sentiments. The Big Issue placed it at #48 on a 2021 list of the \"80 best Bob Dylan songs - that aren't the greatest hits\". Actress Julia Roberts has cited Dylan as her favorite singer and \"Buckets of Rain\" as her favorite song. Stereogum ran an article to coincide with Dylan's 80th birthday on May 24, 2021 in which 80 musicians were asked to name their favorite Dylan song. Black Midi's Geordie Greep selected \"Buckets of Rain\" noting that the \"words are sparse and natural, strengthened in their purity by his undeniably emotive performance. While not a complicated narrative or vividly painted scenario like some other songs on the album, the track still makes room for some dynamite lines. One example being, 'Everything about you is bringing me misery', which, coming as it does after a string of compliments to the unnamed second person, is a punchline almost as hilarious as it is devastating. Wonderful song\"."

        "content": "Al Kooper and Mike Bloomfield had previously worked together on the sessions for the ground-breaking classic Highway 61 Revisited by Bob Dylan, as well as playing in support of his controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival in July 1965. Kooper had recently left Blood, Sweat & Tears after recording their debut album with them, and was now working as an A&R man for Columbia. Bloomfield was about to leave Electric Flag, and at relative loose ends. Kooper telephoned Bloomfield to see if he was free to come down to the studio and jam; Bloomfield agreed, leaving Kooper to handle the arrangements. Kooper booked two days of studio time at CBS Columbia Square in May 1968, and recruited keyboardist Barry Goldberg and bassist Harvey Brooks, both members of the Electric Flag, along with well-known session drummer \"Fast\" Eddie Hoh. On the first day, the quintet recorded a group of mostly blues-based instrumental tracks, including the modal excursion \"His Holy Modal Majesty\", a tribute to the late John Coltrane that was also reminiscent of \"East-West\" from the second Butterfield Blues Band album. On the second day, with the tapes ready to roll, Bloomfield returned to his home in Mill Valley, California, alleging that he had been unable to sleep. Needing to have something to show for the second day of sessions, to sit in for Bloomfield, Kooper hastily called upon Stephen Stills, also in the process of leaving his band Buffalo Springfield. Regrouping behind Stills, Kooper's session men cut mostly vocal tracks, including \"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\" from Highway 61 and a lengthy and atmospheric take of \"Season of the Witch\" by Donovan. Although Harvey Brooks's closing \"Harvey's Tune\" includes overdubbed horns added in New York City while the album was being mixed, the album only cost $13,000 to complete. The success of the album opened the door for the \"supergroup\" concept of the late 1960s and 1970s, as exemplified by the likes of Blind Faith and Crosby, Stills & Nash. Kooper forgave Bloomfield, and the two of them made several concert appearances after the album was released. The results of one of those became the album The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper."

Like their song \"Tire Me\" from the 1996 album Evil Empire, \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d never had a music video or was released on any media formats. It did however receive enough radio airplay to become an album favorite. The artwork most commonly associated with the song is from a competition the band held for the then upcoming album The Battle of Los Angeles. Competing artists were given titles to put on their covers including \"Agunzagun\", \"Battle Hymns\", and \"The Battle of Los Angeles\". One of the titles was even a verse from \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d - \"The Riot Be the Rhyme of the Unheard\". Tom Morello eventually used the name \"Battle Hymns\" for a track on his debut album, One Man Revolution in 2007. \"Calm Like a Bomb\" is notable as a display of guitarist Tom Morello's creative use of a whammy pedal. Like many of RATM's songs, the song's lyrics discuss social inequalities. The song also features a reference to Emiliano Zapata. Tim Commerford uses a combination of a home-made overdrive pedal and the Jim Dunlop 105Q Bass Wah pedal on his bass throughout the song. In Rolling Stone magazine's feature article on the new \"Guitar Heroes,\" a section was printed about Tom Morello, and \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d was cited as the prime example of his skill and fame on the guitar. He has occasionally referred to the extremely high whammy-pedal effects used in songs such as this as \"pterodactyl sounds.\" \"Calm Like a Bomb\" made its live debut on June 11, 1999, at the K-Rock Dysfunctional Family Picnic in Wantagh, New York at Jones Beach Amphitheater. It was prominently featured in the ending credits of The Matrix Reloaded and was also included in the film's soundtrack."

        "content": "The song was written by Joel about a Russian clown named Viktor Razinov, whom he met while touring the Soviet Union in 1987. Throughout the song, major items of Viktor's and Billy's lives are compared to show the cultural differences and similarities of the United States of America and the Soviet Union. In the song, Billy describes Viktor's life as one of many Soviet children who lost fathers during World War II, specifically during the siege of Leningrad. He enlisted in the Red Army, drank vodka to fight the pain, and then became a circus clown, bringing joy to Russian children. Billy described his childhood life as being \"born in \u201849, a Cold War kid in McCarthy time.\" He briefly describes his life living in Levittown, and the fear of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Billy also makes a reference to the Korean War, a proxy war to the Cold War, as well as the Vietnam War. In the end, the two meet after Billy's Leningrad concert (Viktor had journeyed across Russia to see all six of the Russian concerts), where Viktor draws a laugh from Billy's daughter Alexa. Billy and Viktor embrace afterwards. In the song's last line, Billy sings,  \"We never knew what friends we had, until we came to Leningrad.\" The quote is printed on the single cover, but not on the cover of the 4 track CD, which instead features the titles of the extra songs: \"Goodnight Saigon,\u201d \"Vienna,\u201d and \"Scandinavian Skies.\u201d In 2015, Viktor traveled to New York to see Billy Joel's concert in Madison Square Garden. For this reunion, Billy played \u201cLeningrad,\u201d which he rarely plays live. The piano riff that begins and ends the song is a loose quote of the main theme of the first movement of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. It may also be that Joel was influenced by Air on the G String by Johann Sebastian Bach. Leningrad's signature opening and closing segments appear to be a nod to Air on the G String's opening passage first heard by the 10th measure of the 1731 composition."

The lyrics in this song (\"What became of the dreams we had?\", \"What became of forever?\") refer to the breakdown of the friendship between Pete Doherty and Carl Bar\u00e2t, and the subsequent collapse of the band. The song's title (and the chorus's lyrics) echo the title of a popular British situation comedy from the 1970s: Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? The song reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart when released. Pete Doherty claimed in an interview with Newsnight that he had no input for the video of the song, which does not feature the band but two young boys on a council estate (Thamesmead), implied to be a young Pete and Carl. This is incorrect to the story of the two, because they didn't meet each other until their late teens. According to Carl Bar\u00e2t, in the cover photo, Doherty isn't actually wearing a watch."

The basic chord structure of the first half of the bridge, which contains a guitar solo, consists of two repetitions of Fm\u2013D\u266d\u2013A\u266d\u2013E\u266d, followed by a single sequence of B\u266d\u2013Fm\u2013Cm. Upon completion of the guitar solo, the remainder of the bridge consists of a repeating F\u2013Fm\u2013Cm\u2013Fm\u2013D\u266d pattern, followed by a single abbreviated sequence of Fm\u2013Cm\u2013A\u266dm."

EMI Germany chose to release the song as the album's first international single on 28 December 1988, following the Swedish-only singles \"Dressed for Success\" and \"Listen to Your Heart\". Per Gessle later commented that it was chosen \"probably because it was one of the English songs, not because it was one of the best. The single was a complete failure.\" It failed to chart in the three territories where it was released: France, Germany, and Italy. The single was backed by a demo version of \"Silver Blue\", which later appeared in re-recorded form on the duo's 1992 album Tourism. A music video was also produced for \"Chances\". Directed by Jeroen Kamphoff, it alters between concert footage in color, and black-and-white footage from a casino with Marie Fredriksson as a Black Jack dealer and croupier at a Roulette-table, and Gessle as a gambler."

Billboard reviewed it as an \"unusual piece of material \u2014 as off-beat as their current 'Heroes and Villains' smash.

With singing by both Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend, slow dreamy parts and fast angry parts, and a coda that reprises the early Who single \"I'm the Face\", \"Sea and Sand\" is almost a mini-opera unto itself, and is one of the album's most characteristic tracks. It is one of four songs on the album to reference the mod movement. \"Sea and Sand\" also marks a point of reflection in the narrative. After the protagonist leaves home, he is left on the beach. He reflects about his inadequacy in love and inability to fit in at home or with the other tickets and faces within the Mod subculture. The song also speaks to Townshend's growing alienation from his band and the music scene as a whole. As such, it serves as a telling sign of the years to come and the state of the Who during and directly after this period."

In 2002 he took a year off, and during 2003 and 2004 had a widely documented reunion with Art Garfunkel, followed by a Simon & Garfunkel Old Friends reunion tour from October\u2013December 2003 and  June and July 2004, where the duo extensively toured America and Europe and the concerts in New York in December 2003 were registered on both a live album and video that was released by the end of the year. Also in December 2004, Paul Simon's studio albums were re-released in remastered issues, as well as re-promoted. At this point, Simon was fully involved in the writing and recording of a new studio album. He was introduced to Brian Eno, producer of Talking Heads and U2 among others. According to Simon, one of the first songs written for the album was \"Wartime Prayers\", which became one of the most celebrated tracks of the album and later a concert favourite. Simon commented that, in some kind of premonition, the song was written even before the Iraq invasion in 2003. Soon after, early recording for the album began. The album was recorded in London, New York and Nashville. Simon first met with Brian Eno in London to discuss a collaboration between Eno's electronic production and Simon's classic guitar folk-rock. As Simon said, \"We spent some time in his studio and decided to combine our visions. It took about two years. The actual time I spent with Brian was 20 days, split into four periods. We found we could really work intensely for five days, and after that it was a bit of a burnout.\""

In the way of the songs were written, Simon stated \u2013 \"I start with the rhythm. It's drums first, then I go to key to sound to guitar to the form of the song to the beginning of the melody. As the melody begins, so do the words. That's how it's been since Graceland. I write backward.\" Simon was particularly grateful with the results of the songs written considering of his age. Simon showed special care about the musical venture he traveled since 1986's Graceland. As he put it, \"Once you go away for a bit, you wonder who people think you are. If they don't know what you're up to, they just go by your history. I'm so often described as this person that went to other cultures, which is true, but I never thought of it that way. I suspect people are thinking, 'What culture did you go to?' But this record is straight-ahead American.\" The digital sounds of the 2000s also reportedly inspired Simon. \"I wondered, 'Is this an appropriate context to express various thoughts, given the way people listen now and the way music is exposed to the world?' Pop music, as it's constantly evolving, is completely different from the value system and aesthetic I grew up with and contributed to.\" Simon stated that he wasn't demonizing technological shifts. \"The Internet is opening things up\", he said. \"At first it caused the record business to implode, but now it's making life easier. It's broken the stranglehold that radio had. Downloading has made people more eclectic in their tastes, and I'd guess eventually that will redirect radio to loosen up, because it will have to compete. When that happens, you can say whatever you want, and there will be a place for it.\" Eno was finally not credited as producer but as provider of \"sonic landscape\". Simon expressed gratitude with the album \u2013 \"Working with Brian Eno opens the door to a world of sonic possibilities; plus he's just a great guy to hang with in the studio, or for that matter in life. I had a really good time.\""

The Observer reviewer Neil Spencer praised both Simon's and Eno's work: \"Simon offers no easy answers to the questions sprayed out in his memorable lines, alternating dreamy idylls with grumpy dissatisfaction while Eno's production ebbs and flows like a digitalised Greek chorus.\" He called the album \"a thrilling return to form\". Entertainment Weekly Chris Willman stated that \"patience is rewarded with moments of stellar songwriting\", in an allusion to the high anticipation of the release of the album. Willman praised particularly Brian Eno's work: \"If Surprise seduces a wider audience than the placid-sounding You're the One, thank co-producer Brian Eno, whose sonic upgrade makes his subject's musings more ear-tickling and appropriately tense. [...] Eno finds smart ways to accent Simon's worry lines.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic was also very positive with the album, calling the album a \"comeback\": \"Simon doesn't achieve his comeback by reconnecting with the sound and spirit of his classic work; he has achieved it by being as restless and ambitious as he was at his popular and creative peak, which makes Surprise all the more remarkable.\" Both Billboard and Rolling Stone were more reserved in their praise, with Billboard stating that \"Surprise falls shy of a masterpiece, but it is consistently engaging and offers some of Simon's most creative songs in two decades.\" Rolling Stone wrote that \"despite the album's shiny surface, Simon sounds like Simon\"."

On May 13 Simon performed \"How Can You Live in the Northeast?\" and \"Outrageous\" at Saturday Night Live. Promotion in the UK was next, with Simon performing \"Outrageous\", \"Father and Daughter\" and \"Graceland\" on Later... with Jools Holland. That show also featured performances by David Gilmour with David Crosby and Graham Nash, Elvis Costello and Allen Toussaint, The Streets and Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi. The hype surrounding the release of the album was followed by a positive commercial reception. With Surprise, Paul Simon achieved his greatest week of sales during the Soundscan era, when the album debuted at #14 on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 61,000 copies sold, which slightly surpassed the 60,000 units sold by You're the One back in 2000. Surprise was also Simon's highest chart position in his homeland since The Rhythm of the Saints landed at #4 in 1990. Surprise has sold 296,000 copies in the US. In the UK, reaction was even stronger, with the album debuting at #4, and then becoming his best chart position also since The Rhythm of the Saints was #1 in 1990. During its second week, Surprise notably stayed at #4, and then slipped down to #20 during its third week, disappearing quickly from the charts."

Records on July 30, 1991. It was re-released in 2001 by Zomba Music Group. The album was issued on vinyl for the first time ever on July 29, 2014. The vinyl-only reissue will be distributed via ThinkIndie distribution and sold only at participating independent record stores. The band had originally recorded material in September 1990 at producer/collaborator/friend John Keane's studio in Athens, Georgia. This session, called Mom's Kitchen, featured the majority of the songs that would eventually be recorded for Widespread Panic, along with other tracks like \"A of D\", \"Impossible\", \"Machine\", \"Liza's Apartment (L.A.)\", \"Conrad\", \"Contentment Blues\", and \"Holden Oversoul\", of which the latter two were included on the reissues of Space Wrangler (1988). Mom's Kitchen, however, was never released because the band signed a six-album deal with Capricorn Records in January 1991. Recording of the album proper took place at Emerald Sound Studios (Nashville, Tennessee), Kiva Studios (Memphis, Tennessee), and Duck Tape Music Studio (Decatur, Alabama). The album features T Lavitz on keyboards and was produced by Johnny Sandlin. For many years after the album\u2019s release, rumors swirled that Track 7, C. Brown, was included on the album as a tribute to Camden, Alabama native Cliff Brown Jr., former singer for Tuscaloosa\u2019s The Ecchoing Green. These rumors were thought to have been put to rest when Brown, along with Green bass player Keith Ferguson, described their adventure during a 2004 interview with The Tuscaloosa News. However, the rumors have not completely died and are still currently debated. The band played the album in its entirety at the Charter One Pavilion in Chicago on September 2, 2009."

        "content": "Prior to releasing 1980's British Steel, Judas Priest had been making moves toward streamlining their music into a simpler, less processed sound. That approach came to full fruition on British Steel. \"Breaking the Law\" combines a recognisable minor-key opening riff and a rhythmic chorus as its main hooks. There is a change-up on the mostly instrumental bridge, a new chord progression with Halford shouting \"You don't know what it's like!\" before the sound effect of a police car's siren leads back into the main riff. More recent live performances of the song have featured a short solo by Downing over the bridge. The outro of the song is the main riff played repeatedly with Halford singing the chorus and Downing playing power chords. The song features some sound effects, including the sound of breaking glass and a police siren. The band were recording British Steel at Tittenhurst Park, which was the home of the Beatles's drummer Ringo Starr. For the breaking glass effect, the band used milk bottles that a milkman brought them in the morning, and the police siren was actually guitarist K. K. Downing using the tremolo arm on his Stratocaster. Halford later said, \"It was a time in the U.K. when there was a lot of strife-a lot of government strife, the miners were on strike, the car unions were on strike, there were street riots. It was a terrible time. That was the incentive for me to write a lyric to try to connect with that feeling that was out there.\""

        "content": "Directed by Julien Temple, the video starts with vocalist Rob Halford singing from the back of a 1974 Cadillac Fleetwood Eldorado convertible. Halford meets with two men dressed as priests carrying guitar cases and they enter the bank together. For the breaking the law chorus the two men remove their disguises and are revealed to be guitarists K. K. Downing and Glenn Tipton. They are then joined by bassist Ian Hill and drummer Dave Holland. The people in the bank are incapacitated by the guitars. Meanwhile, the security guard (who has only just awoken) watches on in amazement on the CCTV screens. The band breaks into the safe (with Halford showing 'extraordinary' strength in pulling apart the iron bars). Halford takes from the safe a golden record award for the British Steel album (the music video was shot before the album went platinum). They soon leave the bank with the record and drive away. Concert footage of Judas Priest is now on the CCTV screens and we see the security guard miming along with a fake guitar very much lost in the music. The video ends with the full band driving back along the A40 repeating the chorus until the song is finished. Downing later said, \"I have to chuckle to myself really about how they got us to do whatever it was we were doing. But we were young and it was exciting and we were making probably the first ever heavy metal conceptual video. It reminds us that however big and powerful we were, we still did everything that people wanted us to do...\""

The performance version of the song has changed since it was first performed on the 1981 World Wide Blitz Tour for the follow up to British Steel, Point of Entry: at first, the band would play it the original way it was on British Steel. Later, the band sometimes (for example on the Angel of Retribution tour) played the opening riff with Halford picking for Downing, Downing picking for Tipton and Tipton picking for Hill, then quickly spreading apart to their respective usual positions on the stage for the verse. Over time, the band have raised the tempo of the song during live performances, and a solo was added by Downing (since his departure, his replacement Richie Faulkner composed a new solo, replacing Downing's). In live performances, Halford ends the song by screaming the words \"Breaking the Law\"."

It's a statement against Big Brother or something, about these metal gods that were taking over\". Guitarist K.K. Downing said: \"When we were recording that track we had loads and loads of fun trying to make it sound as metal as we can. We were shaking cutlery trays in front of the microphones to create the sound of metal marching feet\". Halford added: \"In those days there wasn't an Internet, so you couldn't go online and download samples. So we would whip a piece of guitar chord on a flight case or swish a pool cue in front of a microphone for the audio effects. I lifted and dropped that cutlery tray 100 times, I think\". Downing also added: \"Ringo Starr actually owned the house when we were there, so we would go around to see what Ringo had that we could put on our record. So I guess it's Ringo's knives and forks that created the true 'Metal Gods' sound, which is pretty funny to realize\"."

Herbie Hancock received top billing on this album, while Chick Corea was credited first on the album CoreaHancock, another recording from the same tour released by Polydor. On vinyl, \"February Moment\" (and its introduction) are indexed as one track. Moreover, the liner notes state that the sound on the fourth side of the album had to be compressed in order to fit the 13 and a half minute version of \"Maiden Voyage\" and the nearly 22 minute version of \"La Fiesta\" on a single side; this preserved the integrity of the performance, but lowered the sound quality.

It was released as a single in the US on 27 January 1975, backed with \"Snookeroo,\" and reached No. 1 in Canada, #3 in the Billboard charts and reached No. 1 on Cash Box charts in the US. In the song, the narrator meets a woman from Colombia who offers him marijuana; a woman from Mallorca, Spain who offers him cocaine; and a man from Nashville, Tennessee who offers him moonshine whiskey. The narrator declines all of them, saying that they are bad for his health. Harry Nilsson provides backing vocals. Some reissues and later pressings of the Ringo Starr version credit the song as \"No No Song/Skokiaan.\" This is presumably due to a copyright claim by the publishers of the latter song, although details are lacking. There are some similarities between parts of \"Skokiaan\" and the instrumental break between the second and third verses of Starr's version of the \"No No Song,\" but without documentation this is no more than a supposition."

        "content": "The music video for this song was filmed in Tlayacapan, Mexico. The visual style was inspired by the films Jap\u00f3n and Batalla en el Cielo directed by Carlos Reygadas. Anthony Mandler was the video director and portrayed a very specific storyline, intercut with scenes of the band playing in situ. Flowers commented; \u201cMy version of what the song is about is different than what Anthony is portraying in the video\u201d. In a frame story, it tells the story of a young woman around the age of 20. The video opens with her arriving at a large, white, wooden cross in a rocky hill. She mourns in front of it until a man, who had been desperately searching for her, shows up and comforts her. The following scenes are mostly flashbacks that would illustrate the story of how they came to be there. The first of these flashbacks is one in which the same woman is praying at a church; after leaving, she encounters the man outside. They kiss and it is evident that there is a romantic relationship between them. One day she arrives home to their shared house to find the man in bed with another woman; seeing them together, she leaves the house, heavily distraught. As the woman runs through the town with tears in her eyes, the video flashes back to their joyous wedding, making it clear that they are husband and wife and that they were thoroughly happy together. The next scene is another flashback in which the man gazes on as she pours water on her legs, demonstrating the attraction he had for her. Later, the video cuts to a very early scene in the story, set within a bar that the man appears to own. The woman enters and introduces herself for the first time to her future husband, who at the time was chatting to his future mistress. It appears as though she had applied for employment at the bar, because he promptly gives her an apron and leads her away into another room, much to the annoyance of the other woman. In this room the Killers are playing to a small crowd within the bar and in the drums says \"Los Dientes Del Perro\" as the band name, that in Spanish means \"The Dog's Teeth\". She shares a prolonged look with Brandon Flowers as he sings the last verse, before turning away to attend to the man's instructions. The final shot of the music video comes back to the first scene set next to wooden cross, with the woman still on the ground and her husband there with her. The video stars Mexican actors Gustavo Sanchez Parra & Sonia Couoh. There is also an alternate version of the video in which the woman jumps off a cliff instead of reconciling with the husband."

Like Willie Nelson and his hero Buck Owens, Yoakam honed his craft and developed a following away from the Nashville - in his case by playing rock and punk clubs in and around Los Angeles - and his sniping at Music City in the media did not endear him to industry insiders and even some fellow musicians, such as Nashville veteran Steve Earle, who was enjoying his first taste of success around the same time.  Earle later stated, \"We butted heads a little bit, which was turned into this feud by some people, but there was never any personal animosity between us\u2026He pushed my buttons that way, and I resented it.  Nowadays, I sort of wonder what I was defending, because I defended that town right up to the time I left.

Yet everything he does is hyper-calculated\u2026all part of the pose.\"  But Yoakam, who was born in Kentucky, composed much of his own material, and songs like \"Miner\u2019s Prayer\" and \"Readin\u2019, Rightin\u2019, Rt. 23\" clearly showed a profound love and appreciation for his southern roots, and he achieved commercial success largely on his own terms."

Armed with a Telecaster, Anderson provided some fiery treble to Yoakam's songs in much the same way that guitarist Don Rich did for Buck Owens, and along with Yoakam's nasal, high lonesome voice, created a unique sound rooted in the Bakersfield honky-tonk scene from the Fifties.  However, for this album the pair introduced a Tex-Mex sound by employing accordion kingpin Flaco Jimenez, who previously worked with artists like Ry Cooder and Doug Sahm.  This album would also see a personnel shift in Yoakam's backing band, the Babylonian Cowboys, with bassist J.D.

Joy initially refused, saying \"I don't want be like Hank, I just want to be me!\" Eventually, he agreed to come in and record it, on the condition that he would also get to record some of his own songs as well. After the recording, however, the studio manager told Joy that he'd forgotten that the Buckaroos (Buck Owens' band) were practicing for an upcoming tour, and that Joy would have to wait to record his original songs.  Refusing to back down, Joy would show up at the studio at 8 AM every morning, only to be told that the Buckaroos were busy and that he would still have to wait. One night, Joy decided to take a walk around downtown Bakersfield, only to have the brand-new cowboy boots he'd been wearing give him blisters all over his feet: \"[I] barely made it back to the car, and on top of that, I was still upset about everything, and I went back to my hotel room and wrote \"Streets of Bakersfield\"\".  Owens liked the song and released a recording of it in 1973 on his album Ain\u2019t It Amazing, Gracie, and while that version wasn't a major hit, the re-recording he did with Dwight Yoakam in 1988 (with slightly changed lyrics) reached #1 on the Billboard Country Music charts.

The song was perfect for Yoakam, who, like Owens, endured criticism for saying what was on his mind, with lines like \"I just want a chance to be myself\" reflecting his vision of artistic independence and individualism.  Owens, who was probably best known at the time for starring on Hee-Haw despite being one of the most successful country artists of the 1960s, was semi-retired until Yoakam cajoled him into recording the song as a duet.  The pairing proved so successful that Owens went on tour as Yoakam's special guest, where he received a regal welcome from a generation of fans who knew him only as a legend, while reinforcing a passing-of-the-torch claim to Yoakam's honky-tonk ascendance.  Owens also appeared in the music video. The album's other number one single, \"I Sang Dixie,\" was originally demoed in 1981. (\"Floyd Country\" was also recorded during these demo sessions.)  Anderson later commented, \"\u2019I Sang Dixie\u2019 I'd always set a little aside, because I thought it was his best song.  And I didn't want to put it on the first or even second album, because I thought this is a number one record.  And you've got to beat the doors down with the other material so that they're ready to listen to you.\"  Rolling Stone ranked \"I Sang Dixie\" No. 26 on its list of the 40 Saddest Country Songs of All time in 2019.  The song's narrator describes meeting a man from the Southern United States dying on a street in Los Angeles. The narrator, while crying, holds the man and sings 'Dixie' to comfort him as he dies. He goes on to describe how others \"walk on by\" ignoring the man's suffering. The dying man warns the narrator with his final words to \"run back home to that southern land\" and escape \"what life here has done to me\".  The song was released as a single in October 1988 and rose to the top of the charts the following year."

        "content": "As noted by Yoakam biographer Don McLeese, the subject matter on Buenas Noches \"is almost relentlessly bleak, occasionally lethal, a descent into the depths of honky-tonk hell.\"  Side one of the original LP contains five songs that tell a paranoid tale of adultery and murder execution-style, although producer later Pete Anderson insisted to McLeese: AllMusic critic Thom Jurek writes, \"Not since Leon Payne has anyone gone from love that is so obsessive it cares not a whit for the most basic of life's needs\u2026to a murderous jealousy\u2026to homicide in the first five songs.  Side one begins with \"I Got You,\" which was released in February 1989 as the album's third single, peaking at #5.  With lines like, \"I got a letter from the folks over at Bell, just to let me know for my next phone call I could walk outside and yell,\" the song is practically the album's only source for wry humor, detailing the troubles of a narrator trying to make ends meet while taking solace in the fact that he has the woman he loves \"to ease my pains\" and \"keep me sane.\"  This rosy outlook is shattered with the gentle waltz \"One More Name\u2019 as the narrator hears the woman uttering names in her sleep \u2013 presumably the names of her lovers.  Now paranoia carries over into the drum-heavy \"What I Don\u2019t Know,\" which contains the near psychotic warning \"What I don\u2019t know might not hurt me, but what I don\u2019t know might get you killed.\"  A cover of Johnny Cash\u2019s \"Home of the Blues\" comes next and finds the narrator alone in a house \"filled with the sweetest memories, memories so sweet that I cry.\"  The story culminates with \"She Wore Red Dresses,\" a murder ballad that finds the narrator \"like a madman\" praying for vengeance before tracking down the woman and her lover and shooting her in the head.  (Unsurprisingly, considering the song's dark subject matter, the single failed to make the country Top 40.) Side two maintains the album's thematic grimness and melancholy.  The cover of Lazy Lester's \"I Hear You Knockin\u2019\" might sound comparatively cherry, but its lyrics reinforce the emotional bleakness, while Yoakam's interpretation of the Hank Locklin classic \"Send Me the Pillow\" is full of longing and heartache. (Maria McKee, who sang \"Bury Me\" with Yoakam on his debut LP, provides background vocals on the song.) \"Floyd County\" chronicles the death of a man who was a pillar in the community.  Even the closing number \"Hold On to God,\" a gospel song written for his mother Ruth Ann, sounds more like a declaration of forbearance rather than a celebration of faith.  Yoakam later quipped of the song cycle, \"I get moody.  I kill someone.  Then I get religion in the end.  This record\u2019s more me \u2013 there are expressions of me that people have never heard before.\""

The music on the radio single differed from the album version in having a more urgent, driving beat, fueled by Tom Hamilton's bass, and slightly different sax notes. This version had an earlier fadeout, omitting the classic clarinet and trumpet duet behind Tyler's scat singing. The video (see below) is based on the album version of the song."

Johnny Marr later responded to Brock's comments by saying \"Isaac contacted me and asked if I'd help Modest Mouse write the new album. I was intrigued and played with the band in Portland a couple of times. We hit it off and wrote three great songs straight away, something clicked, it felt right from the off. I have a new Healers album pretty much done, but we've been having such a good time playing these new Modest Mouse songs. When people hear the record they'll see why, we're very good together.\""

It scarcely matters: 10 years into their career, Modest Mouse have stumbled into their best album yet.\" The Austin Chronicle gave it four stars out of five and said the album \"sounds like Modest Mouse, only better.\" Mojo also gave it four stars out of five and called it \"a winner\".

Music UK gave it seven stars out of ten and stated, \"The problem is, there's simply too much record here.\" Playlouder gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said it \"could be Modest Mouse's finest hour were it not a little long - the nuances are occasionally rather swamped by the effort of listening to the hour-long record through.\" Slant Magazine also gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it \"a really good, if not necessarily phenomenal, rock record.\" The Boston Globe gave it a positive review and said that if the album \"is a little much to take in all at once, the sheer mass of the tunes becomes easier to manage over repeated listens.\" LAS Magazine gave the album a score of 6.8 out of ten and said, \"A disproportionate amount of the album's tracks sound like a commercialized knockoff of previous songs, past highlights revisited after a process of radio ready distillation.\" Prefix Magazine gave it 6.5 out of ten and called the album \"exhausting\". Other reviews are average or mixed: Now gave the album a score of three stars out of five and said, \"The album as a whole does drag on, and the songs aren't as immediately grabby as those on their last disc, but We Were Dead is more interesting and varied than Good News.\" Hot Press also gave it a score of three out of five and said it had \"some excellent moments\". The Village Voice gave it an average review and said, \"Imagine the cheerful fatalism of \"Float On\" without the hooks, which is bizarre: Hooks would seem to be Marr's specialty.\""

Eager to continue her growth as an artist, Jamelia was determined to continue making music that reflected her personality and musical outlook: \"My whole aim was to do something different. I do not believe in giving people something that they have already heard from me. We know what worked the last time (on Thank You) but I think changing and reinventing yourself is the way forward.\""

Her beguiling vulnerability has been sacrificed, but strength and power have emerged in its stead.\" AllMusic editor Sharon Mawer found that \"the album lost its way a little in the middle as \"La La Love,\" \"Go,\" and \"Get Up, Get Out\" are rather insipid, chugging mid-tempo ballads, and then it's back to R&B-soul on \"Got It so Good.\" The album closed with \"Hustle,\" a Latin-grooved dance track that did exactly what you would expect, and a good way to end an album, leaving the audience wanting more.\" The Daily Telegraph wrote that \"there's a spark of life to this album.\" Kitty Empire, writing for The Observer, felt that Walk with Me \"is both spirited and sensible, sustaining tunes all the while. There's a steady pop production hand at work which means much of the album's mid-section treads water nicely enough as it recalls Liberty X [...] And while Walk with Me hasn't quite got it all, exactly \u2013 Jamelia's voice is too often slimline and catchless, for one \u2013 the album only adds to her ineluctable jamminess.\" BBC critic Talia Kraines called the album \"a continuation of the brilliant singles, mundane albums routine\" on Jamelia's previous projects. John Murphy from musicOMH declared Walk with Me \"Jamelia's finest album yet. Now happily engaged and the mother of two children, she may be a million miles away from the relationship that inspired her earlier songs, but she retains an edge and class that cements her position as this country's leading soul vocalist,\" continuing \"that trend of strong songwriting\" with \"the finest pop-soul you'll find this side of the Sugababes.\""

James sent to Warp Records in 1990 prior to his signing. The album is rumored to be an imitation of the classic Warp artist LFO. James recorded the songs possibly around 1989-1990. GAK 1 Is an example of early techno, mainly structured around a repetitive CR-78 pattern with a piano melody. GAK 2 is similar but has a more ambient techno sound than any other tracks on the E.P. GAK 3, however is a much darker, track with racing synths and a hard 4\u20134 beat, one of James' attempts to create a more rave type of sound. This album was released both in CD digital and 12\" formats; the cover artwork is by The Designers Republic."

        "content": "The song is written in the key of E-flat minor. The lyrics, which Rolling Stone characterized as \"biblically chauvinistic\", attribute all the works of modern civilization (the car, the train, the boat (\"Like Noah made the ark\"), and the electric light) to the efforts of men, but claim that it all would \"mean nothing without a woman or a girl\". The song also states that man made toys for the baby boys and girls, and comments about the fact that \"Man makes money\" to buy from other men. Before the song's fade, Brown states that man is lost in his bitterness and in the wilderness. Brown's co-writer and onetime girlfriend, Betty Jean Newsome, wrote the lyrics based on her own observations of the relations between the sexes. Newsome claimed in later years that Brown did not write any part of the song, and she argued in court that he sometimes forgot to pay her royalties. In May 1966, Record World magazine reported that Brown, King Records and Dynatone Publishing were being sued by Clamike Records for alleged copyright infringement of the Betty Newsome song \"It's a Man's World (But What Would He Do Without a Woman)\". The composition of \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" developed over a period of several years. Tammy Montgomery, better known as Tammi Terrell, recorded \"I Cried\", a Brown-penned song based on the same chord changes, in 1963. Brown himself recorded a demo version of the song, provisionally entitled \"It's a Man's World\", in 1964. This version later appeared on the CD compilations The CD of JB and Star Time. The released version of \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" was recorded quickly, in only two takes, with a studio ensemble that included members of Brown's touring band and a string section arranged and conducted by Sammy Lowe. A female chorus was involved in the recording sessions, but their parts were edited out of the song's final master. \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" became a staple of Brown's live shows for the rest of his career. Its slow, simmering groove and declamatory vocal line made it suitable for long, open-ended performances incorporating spoken ruminations on love and loss and sometimes interpolations from other songs. It appears on almost all of Brown's live albums starting with 1967's Live at the Garden. Brown also recorded a big band jazz arrangement of the song with the Louie Bellson Orchestra for his 1970 album Soul on Top. Cash Box described the song as a \"slow-shufflin\u2019 emotion-charged item which points out that men are quite incomplete without women to love \u2019em.\" In 2004, \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" was ranked number 123 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time."

Her performance has been voted as the 3rd Most Memorable Grammy Performance of all time. Later, in 2021, she performed the song for two nights at the Hollywood Bowl with Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. British soul singer Joss Stone released a live version (recorded at Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., December 7, 2003) in 2004 as both a vinyl and CD B-side of the A-side single, \"Super Duper Love\". It was included in a commercial for Chanel's Coco Mademoiselle in 2012 starring Keira Knightley.

The original UK Decca single credited Faithfull as a co-writer, but when London Records issued the single in the United States, her name was omitted, as it was from the credit on Sticky Fingers. After a legal battle Faithfull retained her rights as a co-author, acknowledged by the 1994 Virgin Records reissue of the Stones' album catalogue from Sticky Fingers through Steel Wheels."

In some territories such as the Netherlands, Italy and Japan, \u201cSister Morphine\u201d appeared on the A-side. In addition, the French, US and Netherlands editions of the single actually featured alternate versions of both sides to the UK release. Faithfull performed \"Something Better\" sung live to a backing track at The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, but the programme was never televised and no contemporary performance of \"Sister Morphine\" is known. Faithfull recorded the song again in 1979, during the sessions for her Broken English album, and it was subsequently released on a 7-inch and 12-inch single with \"Broken English\". This recording appears as a bonus track on the second disc of the 2013 deluxe edition of the album. The song remains a staple of her concert set-list and appeared on the live albums Blazing Away in 1990 and No Exit in 2016."

        "content": "Cruel Sister was an album recorded in 1970 by folk-rock band Pentangle. It was the most folk-based of the albums recorded by the band, with all the tracks being versions of traditional songs. Whereas their previous album had been produced by Shel Talmy, and featured quite a heavily produced, commercial sound, Cruel Sister was produced by Bill Leader, noted for his recordings of folk musicians. \"Lord Franklin\" is a version of the traditional ballad, also known as \"Lady Franklin's Lament\", which describes Sir John Franklin's ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage. John Renbourn sings the lead vocal and plays both acoustic and electric guitar. \"Cruel sister\", the song which provides the title for the album, is a traditional ballad (known in some versions as The Twa Sisters), telling the story of the violent rivalry between two sisters for the love of a knight. The whole of side two of the album is taken up with an extended version of the ballad \"Jack Orion\", previously recorded by Jansch on his own Jack Orion album. \"Jack Orion\" is a version of the Child ballad \"Glasgerion\". The arrangement on Cruel Sister develops through several sections with different rhythms and instrumentation. The album cover features engravings by Albrecht D\u00fcrer. The front cover displays his \"The Men's Bath\" (Das M\u00e4nnerbad) (date unknown). The picture on the back cover is his The Sea Monster (Das Meerwunder), dating from 1498."

But even listening to the song right up to the mixing stage I was going, \"Does this work at all?!\" Here was Mike playing a very up, country guitar line while I'm playing this choppy down riff on the opposite end of the groove spectrum. Meanwhile, Jeff's got this totally other bass line going that's not really steady, and he's going off in a melodic direction, too. So there's not really anybody holding it down, and Dave's got to decide either to play it more the country way or play it the funky way. There was this precarious balance, and then suddenly the bridge comes in from out of the blue, which, if Eddie doesn't sing it just right, sounds sort of foreign. Finally, it never goes back to the chorus at the end, it turns into something else."

The work takes up the entire B-side of the album. The single version of the song peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, kept from the number 1 spot by \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\" by Jim Croce.  It was the duo's fifth number two hit and made them the act with the second-most number two hits on the chart behind Madonna. The song also peaked at number 1 on the easy listening chart, becoming their eighth number 1 on that chart in four years. It is The Carpenters' biggest-selling record worldwide and their best-selling single in the UK, peaking at number 2. Richard Carpenter stated, on a Japanese documentary, that it was his favorite of all the songs that he had written. He has performed an instrumental version at concerts. According to Cash Box, on June 2, 1973, \"Yesterday Once More\" was the highest-debuting single at No. 71. By August 4, it had reached No. 1."

The next year, it was issued as the second single in other countries. The song was written by Paul Bliss, while production was handled by Christopher Neil. After its release, \"(If There Was) Any Other Way\" received positive reviews from music critics. The song peaked at number 23 in Canada and number 35 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, it became a success on the adult contemporary charts, reaching number eight in the United States and number 12 in Canada. Two accompanying music videos for the song were filmed.

        "content": "In 1990, Dion was preparing to issue her first English-language album, Unison. After releasing various French-language albums in Canada and France in the '80s, she recorded new English songs in London, Los Angeles and New York. At first, Unison was released in Canada, and \"(If There Was) Any Other Way\" was chosen as its lead single. Written by British musician, Paul Bliss, and produced by British record producer, Christopher Neil, it was issued on 26 March 1990. One year later on 18 March 1991, \"(If There Was) Any Other Way\" was released as the second single in the United States after \"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\". For the US market the single was remixed by Walter Afanasieff. This US version features a different audio mix from the Canadian single version and the album version: reverb has been applied throughout (most noticeably to Dion's vocal track), the guitars have been rebalanced so that they are less audible in some places in the song and more prominent in others, the drum track features \"rimshot\" effects during the chorus, additional synthesizer lines have been overdubbed onto the existing keyboard track (most noticeably in the bar before the instrumental break), and the fadeout has been slightly extended in length. It was also used in the American music video of the song that year. Additionally \"(If There Was) Any Other Way\" was remixed by Daniel Abraham, a French record producer living in New York. His dance remixes appeared on a promotional US single. \"(If There Was) Any Other Way\" was also released as a single in selected European countries, Australia, and Japan in June 1991."

Larry Flick from Billboard noted that Dion \"continues to soar\" with a \"spirited, up-tempo\" song. He complimented the \"crystalline production and shimmering backup vocal support combined with a passionate lead performance\". Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report wrote about the song: \"Nothing like witnessing the growth and development of a genuine artist. Celine definitely falls into that category, capturing the hearts of Americans the way she's been doing in her native Canada for the past several years. Switching from torch song to snappy rhythm affords listeners an opportunity to hear another side of this wonderful talent\". Music & Media noted that \"talented Canadian chanteuse enters the Whitney Houston racket\" and described it as \"satisfying AC pop.\" Christopher Smith from TalkAboutPopMusic described it as a \"pop-soft rock mid tempo number\"."

At the end of the video, Sisq\u00f3 goes to his house with a bouquet of flowers for his girlfriend when he sees a guy walking out. He goes inside and sadly finds her in bed with a woman and drops the flowers in heartbreak. He leaves the house for a few seconds and goes back in.

        "content": "Hearts on the Line is an album by the country rock group The Burrito Brothers, released in 1981. After the Flying Burrito Brothers scored a minor country hit in 1979 with a live cover of Merle Haggard's \"White Line Fever\", the band was dropped from their record contract and hit yet again with personnel changes. By 1980, Greg Harris and Ed Ponder had left the group, leaving the Burritos as a trio of \"Sneaky\" Pete Kleinow, Gib Guilbeau and Skip Battin. In addition to commitments with the Flying Burrito Brothers, Guilbeau was also working as a songwriter for Criterion Music with John Beland, who Guilbeau knew from his time in the band Swampwater. Guilbeau and Beland wrote some songs and ultimately, Beland was invited to join the Burritos. Beland was reluctant to join the now nearly defunct band, as he was riding strong as lead guitarist with Ricky Nelson who (with Beland's help) was enjoying his own comeback of sorts. However, after leaving Nelson in the hopes of producing the Burritos, Beland took the Burritos in a more commercial direction, having already written a number of country hits for other artists prior to his joining the FBB. In addition, the band's name at this time was shortened to simply The Burrito Brothers, a suggestion made by Curb Records. Beland's song demos, which featured the Burritos on them, eventually made it to Dick Whitehouse at Curb records, who signed the band to a deal with Curb / Epic Records. By December 1980, the band's first single for Curb, \"She's a Friend of a Friend\" reached the US country top 70. Hearts on the Line followed in January 1981 and spawned two further singles, both of which made the US country top 20, \"Does She Wish She Was Single Again?\" and \"She Belongs to Everyone But Me\". More would follow. That year, The Burrito Brothers received the number one \"Crossover from pop to country\" award from Billboard Magazine as well as best new vocal group award from Record World Magazine. But Skip Battin was fired from the band after the photo shoot for the album cover of Hearts on the Line, and was replaced in the studio by Dennis Belfield on bass. Mickey McGee was also replaced on drums by Ron Krasinsky, for the recordings. The success of the Burrito Brothers marked the first time in the band's 11-year history of having any serious chart success. During their span as a country hit act, they scored nine hits for Curb Records.  Despite this success, the album is currently unavailable."

        "content": "The concept behind The Bradley Barn Sessions was to place Jones in the hands of traditionalist country producer Brian Ahern, record at Owen Bradley's legendary studios, compile a selection of the singer's greatest hits, and have him sing duets with not just some of the biggest names in country but also pop music as well.  Although the album \u2013 Jones' fourth for MCA \u2013 did not break the top twenty on Billboards country albums chart, peaking at 23, it features the first recorded duet between the singer and his ex-wife Tammy Wynette since their 1981 LP Together Again.  The only single release from the album was \"A Good Year for the Roses\", a collaboration with Alan Jackson.  As Jones noted in his autobiography two years later, \"After the duets album was released, radio didn't know what to do with it...Alan was white-hot on the radio, and programmers wanted his voice.  But some didn't want his if they had to take mine.  The vast majority of Alan's other single records have gone to number one.  His duet with me was his first not to crack the top 50.\"  It actually peaked at number 57.  In June 1995, the song won the Music City News Country Awards \"Vocal Collaboration of the Year\". In addition to a who's who of past and present country stars, the album boasted two significant contributors from outside the country music field.  The first was Mark Knopfler, primarily known as leader and guitarist for the rock band Dire Straits.  A big country fan who had recorded an album with Chet Atkins in 1990, Knopfler played guitar and sang background on a remake of Jones's first number one country hit from 1959, \"White Lightning\", and can be heard laughing as Jones hams it up on the vocal.  The other rock musician who sang with Jones was Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones on \"Say It's Not You\", which originally appeared on Jones's 1967 album If My Heart Had Windows.  In a 2004 interview that was posted on his website, Richards said of the meeting, \"That was a great experience...To sing with George \u2013 and get away with it! \u2013 was amazing.  What a possum.\"  In a 1996 Rolling Stone interview Jones confessed to Chuck Dean, \"I'll be honest with you: I love Keith Richards more than anything as a person.  He's a character \u2013 just fun to be around.\"  An hour-long documentary-style special was filmed in late 1994 to promote the duet album. It aired in 1995 on The Nashville Network.  Among the guests were the duet partners, Tony Brown, Brian Ahern, and Owen Bradley. Several unreleased tracks recorded during this album's sessions were later included on Jones' 2008 duets album Burn Your Playhouse Down."

Larry Flick from Billboard deemed it as a \"formidable return to her dance roots.\" Alex Henderson and Bryan Devaney from Cashbox called it a \"happy, innocuous, mid-tempo, slightly Caribbean-flavored pop song\". The Daily Vault's Mark Millan noted it as a \"sweet\" song, picking it as one of three \"real hits\" of the album, with \"Coming Out of the Dark\" and \"Seal Our Fate\". Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote that Estefan \"waits for the second verse to add her well known Latin influences. Up to then, the overall feel is more African.

This clever arrangement adds to the song's excitement.\" A reviewer from Music Week described it as a \"bouncy insubstantial number which recalls her earlier work\". The reviewer added, \"A hit for sure\"."

The album also features a secret live instrumental cover of \"Strangers in the Night\" inserted into their cover of \"Train Kept A-Rollin'\", which was probably a nod to a similar quote by Jimi Hendrix during \"Wild Thing\" at the Monterey Pop Festival. The back of the CD cover includes two coffee stains over the picture of Joe Perry playing before a live audience. The original LP cover had the coffee stains, but not the picture of Perry, which was part of the gatefold artwork. The record also features one of Aerosmith's first live versions of The Beatles \"Come Together\", which they performed in the 1978 movie Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and the first record appearance of Richie Supa's \"Chip Away the Stone\" (the studio version of this song would later be released on 1988's Gems compilation). In the band memoir Walk this Way, Perry recalls, \"I didn't want to do a live album at the time because there were so many perfect live albums coming out, all doctored and fixed and overdubbed. Big deal. Double live album - 'standard of the industry'. I felt like we had to avoid that and do a real live album like Live at Leeds or Get Yer Ya Ya's Out or that old Kinks album.\" In his own 2014 memoir Rocks, Perry confessed that the idea behind the LP confounded their label Columbia:"

The first night it was 42 degrees in northern Minnesota; the second it was 106 in South Dakota and all I had on was my shorts, and my feet were up on the handlebars to keep them from boiling on the engine.  It was just silence and feeling nature. Rolling Stone critic Dave Marsh described it as an \"anthemic\" song and considers it Seger's best single. Marsh interprets the song as being about \"leaving a shattered home for a life that has to be better, though it never quite is.\"  Marsh elaborates that the narrator of the song has lost his love and so goes off on a cold and lonely journey while he \"lets his frustrations and confusion congeal into one sad cry that dissolves his fate into what has happened to the whole crazy mess of a world in which he lives.  He sings that he plans to straighten things out for as long as he is searching but at the end he admits that only next time will they be able to get it right.  Marsh feels that Roy Bittan's \"elegaic\" piano chords drive home the point that the time for wild rockers to settle down.  Los Angeles Times critic Richard Cromelin says that in the song Seger uses the continental divide as a metaphor for \"confront[ing] questions of right and wrong,\" allowing him to \"shake off his spiritual malaise.\""

This did not happen, with the band instead continuing to record a full-length album at Park South Studios. In mid-1983, in PiL's absence, Keith Levene took the unfinished album tapes and did his own mix. He then flew over to London and presented them to Richard Branson as the finished new PiL album for Virgin Records: Commercial Zone. For his part, John Lydon decided to completely abandon the tapes and re-record the whole album from scratch with session musicians. This new version of Commercial Zone became This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get in 1984. Five songs on This Is What You Want...This Is What You Get are re-recordings of tracks which originally appeared on Commercial Zone: \"Bad Life\" (originally titled \"Mad Max\"), \"This Is Not a Love Song\" (originally titled \"Love Song\"), \"Solitaire\" (entitled \"Young Brits\" on the second pressing of Commercial Zone), \"The Order of Death\" (originally titled \"The Slab\"), and \"Where Are You?\" (originally titled \"Lou Reed Part 2\"). Four songs from Commercial Zone, \"Bad Night\", \"Lou Reed Part 1\", \"Blue Water\" and \"Miller Hi-Life\", were not re-recorded for This Is What You Want...This Is What You Get (although a remixed version of \"Blue Water\" was included as the B-side on the \"This Is Not a Love Song\" 12\" single).

The song \"The Order of Death\" appears in the 1990 science fiction-horror film Hardware and on the soundtrack to the 1999 horror film The Blair Witch Project. It was also featured in the Miami Vice episode \"Little Miss Dangerous\" and the Mr. Robot episode \"eps2.7_init_5.fve\". It also appears in Season 2 Episode 6 of The Umbrella Academy when the Hargreeves siblings take the elevator to the Tiki Lounge to meet with their father. \"This is Not a Love Song\" appears in the film Waltz With Bashir. The line \"This is what you want... This is what you get\" appears in both \"Bad Life\" and \"The Order of Death\". \"The Order of Death\" is a reference to the film Copkiller, also known as The Order of Death.

Summer had become the biggest star of the disco era in the 1970s when signed to Casablanca Records. By 1987, Summer was signed to the Geffen label, and Casablanca had long since been bought out by Polygram. This album was released on Polygram's Casablanca label. It features some of her most famous songs from the disco era in their extended 12\" versions, as they would often have been played in the clubs during their popularity. The song \"Bad Girls\" was not included on the CD release. In 2003, the tracks from this compilation were remastered to form the 12\" Singles & More bonus disc of the Bad Girls Deluxe Edition. On this new CD, \"Bad Girls\" appeared as it did on the original LP of The Dance Collection. However, \"With Your Love\" was replaced with the long version of \"On The Radio\". The release featured the 12\" single mix of the \"MacArthur Park Suite\", rather than the original Live and More album version which appears on The Dance Collection. The digital (streaming and downloading) edition of The Dance Collection restores the original LP track listing."

The album was recorded at Basshunter Studio and PJ Harmony Studio. Basshunter produced most of the songs; three were produced by PJ Harmony. Vocals were recorded by Basshunter and Robert Uhlmann at Basshunter Studio and Extensive Studio. LOL was mastered by Bj\u00f6rn Engelman at the Cutting Room. Ali Payami assisted Basshunter on three tracks. According to the singer, its songs have elements of hard dance and hard trance and he chose them for his old and new listeners. \"Strand Tyl\u00f6sand\" is inspired by party that Basshunter and its friends had in the summer of 2005. Basshunter said that he had more songs and planned to release a continuation of LOL called ROFL or KTHXBYE for free but he couldn't do it due to the record label."

Steen considered \"Festfolk\" the album's best song. Stefan Thungren of Svenska Dagbladet sensed an intentional inadequate execution in the material, and wrote that the sophisticated, difficult shout in \"Festfolk\" was inspired by the musician E-Type. Thungren compared \"Strand Tyl\u00f6sand\" to the band Gyllene Tider's summer hits, criticised the trance adaptation of the Swedish national anthem in \"Sverige\", and noted a certain melancholy in the instrumental version of \"Boten Anna\". Andreas Nordstr\u00f6m from Expressen negatively described album as one of the most difficult records in the history. Basshunter found the Nordstr\u00f6m review amusing."

The song features Fuzzy and Sauce from the R&B group Somethin' for the People with Fuzzy providing the chorus and ad-libs, while Sauce is a credited as a producer on the track. The song reached number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was also a top-five hit in the UK, reaching number two, and entered the top 20 in Iceland, Ireland, and New Zealand. The accompanying music video features Smith playing with his son, Trey, as well as numerous clips of several other famous men with their children.

Ronald LaPread, the group's bass player, began jamming. Bit by bit, the rest of the band joined in until they came up with a track and bass line. Upon returning, James Carmichael, the Commodores' producer, heard and recognized that this could be a song worth recording. He asked everyone to see if they could use the riff to come up with a song. Taking the tapes home, William King played them for his wife, Shirley Hanna-King. While he slept, she was inspired to write lyrics for the riff, modifying the expression \"built like a brick shithouse\" for the song. The following day King sang the lyrics to \"Brick House\" to the band, allowing them to think he had written it. They loved it and decided that drummer Walter \"Clyde\" Orange had the funky voice to sing lead vocals, (as opposed to Lionel Richie, who usually sang lead), and the song went on the new album. It took several years before the other members of the group discovered that it was actually Shirley Hanna-King who had written the lyrics, and although she was not originally credited, the band has publicly acknowledged her as the song's writer."

Although the album was a chart success in the UK and the US, it was considerably less successful than their previous album Into the Gap. Subsequent singles from the album also met with mixed results. The new Nile Rodgers-produced version of \"Lay Your Hands on Me\" (now with a more distinct gospel sound) reached No. 6 in the United States, while the next UK single \"Don't Mess With Doctor Dream\" reached No. 15. \"King for a Day\" followed in both markets, peaking at No. 8 in the US and becoming their third and final Top 10 hit there, but only reaching No. 22 in the UK. The aforementioned \"Revolution\" was also released as a single in the UK, but failed to make the top 40, signifying an end to the Thompson Twins' commercial viability there. The US and Canadian pressing of the vinyl album does not include the track \"Breakaway\" but contained a new, Nile Rodgers-produced version of the track \"Roll Over\", though the song was omitted altogether in all other countries. The US and Canadian cassette and CD versions of the album contain both \"Roll Over\" and \"Breakaway\"."

        "content": "Following on from the band's highly successful fourth album, Into the Gap, the writing and recording of Here's to Future Days began in late 1984 with the single \"Lay Your Hands on Me\", which was co-produced by Alex Sadkin and vocalist/guitarist Tom Bailey. Sadkin had produced the last two Thompson Twins albums, which were the band's biggest commercial successes to date, and the new single climbed to No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart. However, the band subsequently decided to part company with Sadkin and set about working on the new album with Bailey taking sole responsibility as producer at Marcadet Studios in Paris, France, using a 3M digital 32-track recorder. It was there that most of the backing tracks were put together. In March 1985, with the album nearing completion and the next single \"Roll Over\" just about to be released in the UK, Tom Bailey suddenly fell ill. After collapsing in his hotel room, he was diagnosed with nervous exhaustion and ordered to rest by doctors. The incident prompted the band to recall all copies of \"Roll Over\", despite the fact that some of them had already been shipped to retail outlets. Bailey then took time off in Barbados to recuperate. Holding off on the album's release led the band to reconsider the entire project, and they began work on it again following Bailey's recovery. This time they enlisted Nile Rodgers to co-produce and help salvage the project at Bailey's suggestion, after having met him in New York during the break and discovering how well they both got on creatively. The direction of the new recordings featured a more guitar-oriented side to it. From early June to early August 1985, additional overdubs and mixing of Here's To Future Days took place at Skyline Studios in New York City with Rodgers assisting as co-producer; the only two major interruptions to recording were the US Independence day celebrations on 4 July and Live Aid on 13 July. Since the band had recorded on more than 24 tracks, two synchronized 24-track tape machines were used for transferring the Marcadet recordings. The direction of the new recordings featured a more guitar-oriented side to it. Bailey explains:"

The band had taken up residence in the \u00a31000 a day AIR Studios; they were there a full year and were agonising (and arguing) over every note of every track. With its heavy use of bass and rock guitars, \"The Lebanon\" was a radical departure from the established synthpop sound of the Human League. Though the song does employ some keyboards, the use of guitars by the band was not lost on music critics who brought up the \"no guitars rule\" that the band had publicly adopted in 1981. The lyrics were an attempt to make a statement on the Lebanese civil war which had been exacerbated by the Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon in 1982. In a television interview, band member Philip Adrian Wright commented that Oakey's politically-charged lyrics were written specifically about the Sabra and Shatila massacre. Singer Susan Ann Sulley said of the song that the band \"wanted to speak up for the little people\" and say something about the situation in Lebanon at the time, and that the band was not trying to be political for the sake of it. The band were criticised at the time for being banal and \"out of their depth\", but in a retrospective review, AllMusic journalist Andy Kellman wrote that the song \"looks atrocious on paper but sounds fantastic\". \"The Lebanon\" was released as a UK single in April 1984. It failed to replicate the Top 3 success of the band's previous singles \"(Keep Feeling) Fascination\" and \"Mirror Man\", only reaching number 11 in the UK Singles chart and number 64 in the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their lowest-charting single ever in the United States. The track is nearly always played by the band live."

The video at first sight appears to be filmed at a Human League concert with the band playing live on stage. The concert was in fact staged and was filmed in takes as the band mimed to playback. The audience were invited extras and bit part dancers were placed in the front of the stage. This is very noticeable when the camera pans onto the audience where certain extras desperately try to play up for their 'shot at fame'. Even though it was a faux concert, the band's appearance on stage is notable for its layout and behaviour. The three vocalists are in a straight line at the front of the stage, a very energetic Susan Ann Sulley on the left, a serious Philip Oakey in the centre and a cool, laid back, sashaying Joanne Catherall on the right, with the instrumentalists to the rear. This arrangement and performance style is still often used when the band plays live."

As a UK best-seller Lewis performed the song live on the BBC's Top of the Pops in the summer of 1996, and its success saw her nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Female Artist in 1997. In the US, Andrea Ganis, executive VP of Lewis' record label, Atlantic, said: \"Radio stations across the country keep telling us the same thing over and over\", Ganis says. \"They play it and, almost overnight, it's their most requested song. Maybe it's because things have been so dark lately in pop and then along comes a record that everybody can sing along to. It's almost like a catharsis for a lot of people.\" It became a \"runaway hit\" without any extra marketing boost from high-profile events of the time such as a hit movie or the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, and was the first single to achieve over one million airplay detections in the US. AllMusic editor Tom Demalon called the song \"compelling\" in his review of Now in a Minute. He noted that Lewis \"has a girlish voice that sounds like a less quirky Kate Bush.\" Larry Flick from Billboard described it as a \"quietly percussive pop chugger\". He complimented Lewis' voice as a \"delicate, girlish voice that gives the song a winsome quality, which adds to its already considerable charm.\" Tracey Pepper from Entertainment Weekly noted that it is \"more sophisticated than a first listen might reveal. \"I Love You Always Forever\"'s chanted chorus, chugging rhythm, and bright melody make it obvious that the newcomer Donna Lewis, whose girlish voice often sounds like Cyndi Lauper's, knows the value of building tension and mood, even in a pop song.\" Kim Renfro of Insider said that the song is a \"true bop\" that is reminiscent of Cyndi Lauper's music of ten years earlier, but with \"slightly more pizazz\". Eamon Joyce from Miscellany News commented that \"upon hearing the song, it's embedded in your head for weeks.\" Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In stated that Lewis \"pledges lifelong commitment\" on the song. In 2018, Stacker ranked it at number 10 in their list of \"Best pop songs of the last 25 years\", noting Lewis' \"ethereal voice over a heavenly backdrop of synthesizers and understated drum beats\"."

It was also released as a single in Australia (the only country to receive both the \"Invisible Sun\" and \"Secret Journey\" singles) and New Zealand.

The album was the first use of the Panda Bear moniker which he later continued to use while performing with group.  It was released on June 1, 1999 shortly before his 21st birthday on the label Soccer Star Records. The label was formed by himself and fellow future Animal Collective member and childhood friend Deakin (Joshua Dibb) and was initially founded only to release this album. However the label eventually morphed into Animal and then Paw Tracks. This album marks the very first Animal Collective related release, apart from the EP \"Paddington Band\", which was a recording by the Animal Collective precursor Automine, which featured all other members of the future group except for Lennox himself. The exact number of compact discs produced is unknown, but can be assumed to be small because the label had no distribution network at the time. It was likely paid out of pocket by Lennox and Dibb themselves. The aforementioned factors as well as lack of awareness and interest led to the album becoming out of print. Lennox commented on the possibility of a reissue in 2004."

Written by Stefani and English pianist Tim Rice-Oxley, the song was released in Europe as the album's fifth and final single on January 18, 2008, by Interscope Records. Musically, \"Early Winter\" is a soft rock and synth-pop ballad with new wave influences. Critics found it similar to songs by English alternative rock band Keane, of which Rice-Oxley is a member. The lyrics of the song describe the nearing of the end of a relationship, and were speculated to be references to Stefani's own relationship with husband Gavin Rossdale. Upon its release, \"Early Winter\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom commended Stefani's vocal delivery and the song's emotional appeal. The song attained moderate commercial success across Europe, reaching number six in Germany and Slovakia, number 12 in Switzerland, and number 14 in Finland. An accompanying music video for \"Early Winter\" was directed by Sophie Muller and was filmed in destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague. It contains scenes of Stefani in a palace-like hall in various gowns and at railway stations. \"Early Winter\" was included in the setlist of The Sweet Escape Tour, and the performances featured a special coda section delivered by American musician and bassist Gail Ann Dorsey."

The production of the song was handled by Nellee Hooper. Before working with Rice-Oxley in the studio, Stefani called him to discuss some of her ideas behind a potential song, saying \"I wanted a ballad. I wanted to write 'Eyes Without a Face' or 'Killing Me Softly' or 'Time After Time,' and he was like, 'OK, Cyndi Lauper, got it,' like he was taking my order.\" In the studio, Rice-Oxley played \"Early Winter\" on a piano, and after hearing the song, Stefani approved of it and commented, \"It was so beautiful and addictive. I didn't really attack it because it was kind of done, lyrics and everything.\" After letting the song \"sit with her for a bit\", she rewrote some of the lyrics. Stefani was the first artist Rice-Oxley wrote a song for outside of Keane, and the singer remarked that \"he's like Clark Kent-subtle, but Superman-talented. I'm lucky I was his first, because I'm sure he's going to go write with lots of girls after me.\" Rice-Oxley would later collaborate with artists like Australian singer Kylie Minogue, and in a 2012 interview, he talked about working with her and Stefani, saying, \"I've been very lucky to work with people at the top of the industry. Both were very talented and more creative than I think they're given credit for. They're both very good writers and singers and they both work so hard, just grafting the whole time. Honing those pop sensibilities through writing with them was good fun\"."

Clark Collis from Entertainment Weekly dubbed it a \"tortured and not un-Keane-like lament\". The lyrics of \"Early Winter\" are based on issues related to the end of a relationship, and Jennifer Vineyard from MTV described them to be \"poignant lyrics about a couple recognizing the beginning of the end\". In the song, Stefani metaphorically compares the end of her relationship with her partner to falling leaves.

Nick Levine of Digital Spy rated \"Early Winter\" four out of five stars, and complimented its emotional nature, naming it a \"forgotten classic from an eighties movie soundtrack\" and deeming it \"the most affecting moment of Stefani's solo career to date\". John Murphy of musicOMH called the song \"rather nice\" and appreciated its lyrical content, although he commented that \"it does sound like Stefani covering a Keane song\". Alex Miller of NME complimented Rice-Oxley's involvement in \"Early Winter\" and singled it out as \"one of the few potential hits\" from The Sweet Escape. Mark Pytlik of Pitchfork picked \"Early Winter\" as one of the highlights from the album and favoured Stefani's vocal delivery, noting that the song \"proves that Stefani still has the ability to elevate an otherwise ordinary rock song to another level\". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine complimented \"Early Winter\" for being \"less forced and much less self-conscious\" in comparison to the rest of the songs on The Sweet Escape, and felt that \"it's refreshing to hear Stefani in her more natural habitat\"."

It opens with a black-and-white scene of Stefani lying on the ground in a long white gown. In the next scene, Stefani is shown walking on the street under red street lights and then holds her love interest, played by her tour backup dancer Steelo Vazquez, against the wall and talks to him. The scene then changes to Stefani walking on a street and later walking into the railway station. In the next scene, Stefani is seen singing under falling red-colored feathers in a huge palace-type hall. Scenes of Stefani staring at herself in the mirror with her hair up and snow falling slowly down, with the lights turning on and off intermittently, are interspersed throughout the video. Stefani is also seen sitting on the ground and singing while crying. She is then shown at a railway station walking besides a moving train. The video ends with Stefani running out of the hall. Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy praised the video for being \"acutely artful, immeasurably stylish\" and commented that \"Gwen's managed to raise the bar on her own superlatively supreme style in her new video.\""

        "content": "Favourite Worst Nightmare is the second studio album by English rock band Arctic Monkeys, released on 18 April 2007 by Domino Recording Company. Recorded in east London's Miloco Studios with producers James Ford and Mike Crossey, the album was preceded by the release of \"Brianstorm\" on 16 April 2007. This is the band's first album with bassist Nick O'Malley, replacing their previous bassist Andy Nicholson, who left the band before the North America tour of the band's debut studio album. In comparison to the band's debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, the album is considered more ambitious, with ambient sounds and expanded drum rhythms being introduced. Like Arctic Monkey's debut, Favourite Worst Nightmare was a widespread critical success, with critics highlighting the band's new emotional depth and Turner's matured songwriting. NME and Uncut ranked it the second-best album of 2007, while Dutch publication OOR named it the best of 2007. In retrospect, the album is considered the start of the band's change of sound with each of their albums after their debut. In its first week of release, the album sold over 227,000 copies, going straight to number one in the UK Albums Chart. \"Brianstorm\" and \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" were also both hits on the UK Singles Chart, with the former reaching number two on the chart. In the United States, the album debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200, selling around 44,000 copies in its first week. The album has since gone 3\u00d7 platinum in the UK. It was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Prize and won Best British Album at the 2008 BRIT Awards."

The band said they also considered naming the album Lesbian Wednesdays, Gordon Brown, or Gary Barlow. In an interview with NME, Nick O'Malley announced several songs including \"D is for Dangerous\" and \"Balaclava\". The tracks \"The Bakery\" and \"Plastic Tramp\" also mentioned in the NME interview did not make it onto the album, but were later released as B-sides on the \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" single. The track \"Leave Before the Lights Come On\" was also rumoured for inclusion, but did not make the final cut. Half of the album's songs were debuted at concerts before the release of the album. The album was recorded quickly as the band wanted to start touring and play the songs. The album's cover art features a black-and-white photograph of a house in the Garston district of Liverpool, with colourful cartoonish images visible through its windows. This marks the second consecutive time the band used a photograph taken in Liverpool as an album cover, following their debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not."

In comparison to the band's debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, the album has been described as \"very, very fast and very, very loud\", being seen as \"more ambitious, heavier...and with a fiercely bright production\". Reflecting the band's travels around the world more than local stories of the first record, FWN is a \"faster, meaner\" album. The album arguably has influences from The Smiths \u2013 \"twanging, quasi-ambient backdrops...and Turner's voice [...] crooning like Morrissey or Richard Hawley.\" Matt Helders said \"James was DJing loads in the evening so we'd go out and [...] have a dance.\" As a result, the drum rhythms of Helders and bassist Nick O'Malley have drawn comparisons to the Eighties funk band ESG. The band's love of classic films also influenced their new style. For example, the organ at the beginning of the album's final track, \"505\" is replicating Ennio Morricone's soundtrack for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (where Angel Eyes enters before the final standoff)."

Their progression was also highlighted with The Guardian saying \"if you removed everything from the album except Matt Helders' drumming, it would still be a pretty gripping listen\", and The Observer praising the new sounds on the album referencing the \"piercing, melodic guitar by Jamie Cook\" and \"where Turner reveals the other weapons in his armoury\" when referring to Alex Turner's progression. Pitchfork Media noticed the \"new emotional depth\" of tracks such as \"Do Me a Favour\", \"Only Ones Who Know\" and \"505\", which were also commonly cited by most other critics as being amongst the highlights. NME and Uncut ranked it as the second-best album of 2007. Dutch publication OOR named it the best of 2007. Jacob Stolworthy of The Independent reviewed the album on its 10th anniversary in 2017, saying, \"Favourite Worst Nightmare was the first sign that Arctic Monkeys would change up their sound with each new record in as drastic a fashion as they wished [...] If their debut defined a generation, this record shaped the band's future in a manner more mature, sexy and - just like the party depicted in the rowdy track 'This House Is a Circus' - berserk as f*ck.\""

To help him with the project, Phillips invited musician and songwriter Richard Scott to assist in its production. In a later interview, Phillips acknowledged Scott's confidence and enthusiasm, but noted that this would sometimes result in Phillips being pushed into musical areas where he was uneasy, perhaps due to Scott's inexperience, having recently graduated from university and wanting to make a career out of music. When it came to the vocals, Phillips was inspired to take them on himself as former Genesis band mates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks had done vocals on their solo albums, and that he was unable to find someone suitable. Phillips had used different guest singers on Sides (1979), but felt that it did not work as well as he had expected. Feeling his vocals were inadequate, Phillips took singing lessons from John Owen-Edwards, who had worked with him on a musical project and had also coached Rutherford. After the backing tracks and rough vocals had been put down for about five songs, Phillips presented his work to his manager Tony Smith and recalled that he was \"extremely impressed\". This was when Phillips was enthusiastic about the album until it became increasingly difficult for him to maintain such a level of interest. During recording at Atmosphere Studios, session drummers were brought in to play parts originally programmed on a drum machine as well as singers for additional vocals. Phillips wrote about this period: \"The money was flowing out. It wasn't a wholly happy time.\" In addition, pressure was placed upon him to change his image and to present the album under the Anthony Phillips Band moniker, something with which he did not agree. Invisible Men was cut by Ian Cooper at Townhouse Studios in London. Phillips encountered problems in finalising the album's release in the US as Passport rejected two cuts that Cooper had prepared, coupled with the opinion that none of the songs were suitable for a single. After the second cut was rejected, Phillips recalled that Cooper \"was a bit beside himself - he just didn't know what else to do\", and received notes from the label's engineer in New York with suggestions to improve it, with which Phillips expressed some disagreement. Following a three month delay, the label suggested a new mix but realised it would cost additional money, so agreed to release the album."

In one incident in the conflict, an Exocet missile struck a British warship and killed 20 crew members. One of Phillips's musician friends, Argentinian guitarist Enrique Berro Garcia, had to leave the United Kingdom. The end of the song includes a segment of a news report of the war, which was originally a recording error but Phillips decided to keep it. Upon finishing the album, management of Street Tunes Records, the UK label that released it in the country, deemed \"Exocet\" too political and ordered its removal. It was replaced with \"It's Not Easy\". The track \"The Women Were Watching\" also concerns the Falklands War."

        "content": "After practicing with Jimi Hendrix's band Noel Redding, Mitch Mitchell and Belfast musicians Gerry McAvoy and Wilgar Campbell at a practice room in Fulham Road, the newly formed band with McAvoy and Campbell got underway recording in Advision Studios. With his first solo album Gallagher continued in the eclectic style that had exemplified his first band, Taste. The album begins with \"Laundromat\" which was to become a regular number in his live set. A blues rock song with a classic Gallagher riff, the song was inspired by the public laundromat located in the basement of his flat where he lived at the time in Earls Court.  The next song, \"Just the Smile\", is an acoustic number that was inspired by the British folk revival. It shows the influence of some of Gallagher's favorite English folk musicians such as Richard Thompson, Davy Graham, and Scottish guitarist Bert Jansch. (Gallagher would later go on to record with Jansch.) \"I Fall Apart\" has a jazz feel to it and features a guitar solo that starts slow and introspective and builds to a powerful climax. The next two songs, \"Hands Up\" and \"Sinner Boy\", were again blues rock and would also become standard numbers for his live show. \"Wave Myself Goodbye\" is another acoustic number, a talking blues song featuring New Orleans style piano provided by Vincent Crane from the band Atomic Rooster (Rory's brother Donal had been acting as tour manager for them). Gallagher plays saxophone in the next song, a jazz number called \"Can't Believe It's True\". Also recorded at the time were two blues classics, Muddy Waters' \"Gypsy Woman\" and \"It Takes Time\" by Chicago blues legend Otis Rush. Muddy Waters was a teenage hero for Gallagher; they ultimately collaborated on Muddy Waters' album The London Muddy Waters Sessions. Although these songs were left off the original album they were included in the CD release. On September 3,2021 a 50-th anniversary edition will be released on multiple formats."

Released in late summer 1964, the album introduced the States to the \"drawling, dirty R&B sound (with the emphasis on the B)\" that typified the group. The album includes several R&B standards, written by the likes of Chuck Berry, Fats Domino and John Lee Hooker, as well as the number one single \"House of the Rising Sun\", here presented in its truncated-for-radio form (it would be restored to full length on the February 1966 compilation The Best of the Animals, and later CD and digital reissues of The Animals would feature the full-length recording). The British album The Animals was released a month later, the group's debut album there albeit with substantially differing contents."

        "content": "McGuinn has described the song's lyrics as an attempt to explain Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, and as having been directly inspired by the book 1-2-3-4, More, More, More, More by Don Landis.  In a 1966 interview with Hit Parader magazine, McGuinn stated, \"It's sort of weird but...what I'm talking about is the whole universe, the fifth dimension, which is height, width, depth, time and something else. But there definitely are more dimensions than five. It's infinite. The fifth dimension is the threshold of scientific knowledge.\"  Talking to Michael Ross of Creem magazine in 1970, McGuinn further explained the song's meaning: \"'5D' was an ethereal trip into metaphysics, into an almost Moslem submission to an Allah, an almighty spirit, free-floating, the fifth dimension being the 'mesh' which Einstein theorized about. He proved theoretically - but I choose to believe it.\" According to the Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan, the song's abstract lyrics were largely interpreted by the band's audience as being about an LSD trip, much to McGuinn's dismay.  The notion that the song was about psychedelic drugs was given further credence when it was singled out, within a month of its release, by Variety magazine as one of a recent spate of pop songs containing references to illegal drug use.  As a result of these allegations, the song was banned by some radio stations in the U.S."

The song features the Bach-influenced organ and electric piano playing of Los Angeles composer, arranger, producer, and session musician, Van Dyke Parks. The song was issued as a single on June 13, 1966, and reached number 44 on the Billboard Hot 100, but failed to chart in the United Kingdom.  The song was also included on the band's third album, Fifth Dimension, which was released on July 18, 1966. Billboard magazine described the single as an \"off-beat lyric rocker with chart-topping potential\".  Cash Box described the song as a \"rhythmic, medium-paced, blues-soaked tale of rejection about a somewhat disoriented young man.\" Critic Bruce Eder, writing for the AllMusic website, called the song, \"the most improbable single ever issued by the Byrds\", and \"the most daring opening track ever on any Byrds album.\"  He went on to note that it followed the release of the band's influential \"Eight Miles High\" single, although, in his opinion, \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\" was more challenging and arguably took the Byrds' psychedelic experimentation to further extremes.\" \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\" was a favorite of the Byrds' bass player, Chris Hillman, who described it as \"one of the greatest songs McGuinn has ever written.\" Following its release, \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\" was performed sporadically during the Byrds' 1966 live concerts, but was abandoned for most of the rest of the group's lifespan.  However, the song is frequently performed by McGuinn during his solo concerts and consequently appears on his 2007 live album, Live From Spain. In addition to its appearance on the Fifth Dimension album, \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\" also appears on several Byrds' compilations, including The Byrds' Greatest Hits, History of The Byrds, The Original Singles: 1965\u20131967, Volume 1, The Byrds, The Very Best of The Byrds, The Essential Byrds, and There Is a Season."

        "content": "Burial was recorded at B\u00f8rud Lydskredderi, Norway, mastered at The Mastering Room, and released on 22 December 1998. Burial was the first release by the Swedish record label Endtime Productions. Critics and fans usually categorize the album's style as either death/black metal or simply metal because it contains elements of several subgenres of heavy metal music. The notable black metal elements on the album include the high-pitched shrieking vocals of Peter Espevoll, some black metal tremolo riffs, such as on \"Innbydelse\", and the slightly raw sound production. However, the album's overall atmosphere is not particularly dark or cold; on several songs the soundscape contains happy sounding elements such as the cheerful power metal vocals of the guitarist Ole B\u00f8rud, creating tensions between the darker elements. The musical output of Burial is a combination of power metal, old school death metal and traditional heavy metal, and the latter style is especially apparent on the main riff of \"Renhetens Elv\". Additionally, the songs contain interludes that include elements of industrial music, such as on the song \"Justified\", jazz and classical music, such as on the song \"Tears of Bitterness\". The guest musician Maria Riddervold played violin on the songs \"Embraced\" and \"Tears of Bitterness\". The musicianship on Burial is virtuoisic, taking the style a step towards technical death metal and progressive death metal, technically exceptionally precise, and contains experimental, bizarre song structures. One critic wrote that the album's style \"varies from extremely aggressive discharges to beautiful guitar harmonies, while the main focus relies on twisted riffs and ferocious directions.\" \"Renhetens Elv\" and \"Innbydelse\" are written in Norwegian, and the rest are in English. Many critics and fans regard the last song, \"Jesus Kom Til Jorden For \u00c5 D\u00f8\", as the highlight of the album. \"Jesus Kom Til Jorden For \u00c5 D\u00f8\" (Norwegian for \"Jesus came to world to die\") is a song arranged by Arnold B\u00f8rud, and it is a hymn-like, doom metal-esque and folkish piece. Arnold B\u00f8rud also played the organs on the song."

Parts I and II were released as the introductory and final tracks on King Crimson's 1973 album of the same name, part III was featured on their 1984 album Three of a Perfect Pair, part IV (itself divided into three identically titled parts) appeared on 2000's The Construkction of Light, and the final part, \"Level Five\", was included on the 2003 album The Power to Believe. Despite breaking the naming convention, Robert Fripp, King Crimson founder and only constant contributor to the suite, insists that \"Level Five\" is part of the pentalogy. In 2011, PopMatters ranked the first part of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" as the eighth best progressive rock song ever."

        "content": "\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\", the longest entry in the pentalogy, was first released as the introductory track to the album of the same name. The song is guided by the shifting guitar of Robert Fripp, but it is in the tense violin of David Cross and the chaotic percussion of Jamie Muir that part I is defined.  The track goes through numerous varied acts and passages, with somber moments and a calm violin solo falling alongside periods of heightened aggression where Fripp's guitar borders on heavy metal and Muir's clangs reach cacophony. Bird calls, metallic clangs, horns, breaking crockery and tin ripping are all featured in Muir's repertoire, and, along with his percussive contributions, he coined the title \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\". In a 1991 interview, Muir said it was a \"very admirable creative decision\" for Fripp to work with him. Much of the track originated from full-band improvisations that began in 1971, with Cross calling it \"grown\" instead of written. Drummer Bill Bruford said the songs were \"hell\" to make given the deliberate lack of in-studio structure. An early version of part I recorded by the 1971 lineup appeared as a bonus track on the 40th-anniversary edition of Islands under the name \"A Peacemaking Stint Unrolls\". While the first part is a many-sectioned, dynamic song that has been described as having a \"kitchen-sink sensibility\", \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\" is much more straightforward and riff-focused, with the sole writing credit going to Fripp. PopMatters called the track a \"roller-coaster of wrath and control\". The main riff of part II, which emerged in 1972 during a live performance at Richmond, Kentucky, is heavy and driving, drawing its host album to a dramatic climax. While the guitar in part II may be the most immediately obvious aspect, John Goldsby of Bass Player called the bass in the song something that \"bass players will still be talking about four decades later\". Fripp considered the first two parts of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" as the refinement of his role as composer in King Crimson. According to Fripp, part I was conceived as the beginning of a King Crimson performance, and part II as the end. \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\" was performed from 1972 to 1974, predominantly in a shortened seven-minute version that left out most of the violin solo and protracted ending passage. Part I was not performed again until 2014, when it was reintroduced as a setlist staple; it remained there through 2019. The new arrangement featured all of the violin segments played on guitar, save for the solo, which was performed by Mel Collins on flute. Part II, alternatively, persisted in King Crimson's sets throughout most of their career. Both the first and second parts of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" have been met with critical acclaim. In 2011, Sean Murphy of PopMatters ranked the \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\" as the eighth best progressive rock song ever. He revised his placement in 2017, putting part I as number fifteen and \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\" as eighty-five. Marc Malitz of Louder Sound judged the first part as the forty-second best progressive song ever."

It was not until 2000 that \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic \u2013 Part IV\" was released, appearing on the album The Construkction of Light. Like part II, part IV is heavily guitar-driven, but it introduces new rhythmic and melodic motifs to the series, which would be explored further in part V. \"Coda: I Have a Dream\" shares some of the series' motifs, but also features lyrics and vocals from Adrian Belew. Though \"Coda\" was performed live with vocals in 2000, it was later performed live as an instrumental in 2001 and 2003. On The Construkction of Light, \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic - Part IV\" is divided into three identically titled tracks that segue into \"Coda: I Have a Dream\", which is followed by a minute of silence. However, part IV and \"Coda\" are indexed together in live releases of the 2000-2003 period, as well as the \"Expanded Edition\" of The Construkction of Light, which also removes the silence after \"Coda\"."

        "content": "Originally, the fifth part of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" was the song \"FraKctured\" off of The Construkction of Light, but, seeing how it bore closer resemblance to \"Fracture\" from 1974's Starless and Bible Black, the band agreed to change the name late in the song's development. The fifth part was ultimately released on 2003's The Power to Believe with the title \"Level Five\". Though nothing in the album's packaging confirmed that the song was part of \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\", it shared elements of the series' rhythmic structure and form. While the relationship to the suite was hinted with an early 2001 tour jam combining a riff from part 1 of the suite with part of this piece, official confirmation only first appeared in the Elements 2017 box set, where it was included in sequence with the rest of the suite and called \"truly LTIA Pt V in all but name.\" The following year, Fripp confirmed that \"Level Five\" was indeed the fifth entry in the suite, but was renamed to \"unseat\" the expectations associated with the \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\" title. It has since appeared on setlists and DGM Live downloads as \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part V\". The track is also listed on various streaming services as \"Level V\" with a Roman numeral, making it more consistent with the naming of the other parts. \"Level Five\" is a heavy guitar-driven track with glitchy and electronic drums that provide a rare, almost industrial groove. Several critics noted the sonic aggression of the song, and some compared the guitar interplay between Fripp and Belew as similar to the music on 1981's Discipline. AllMusic's Lindsay Planer called \"Level Five\" so intense \"that it could easily be mistaken for the likes of Tool, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, or KMFDM\"."

It was released in April 1970 as the third single from the group's fifth studio album, Bridge over Troubled Water (1970). Written by Paul Simon, the song's origins lie in a late-night party, in which the duo and friends began banging on a piano bench. They recorded the sound with a tape recorder, employing reverb and matching the rhythm created by the machine. Simon later wrote the song's guitar line and lyrics on the subject of an untrustworthy lover. The song was a hit single in the United States, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. On the Cash Box Top 100, it reached number one. \"Cecilia\" also did well in Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain, where it reached number two, and also in Switzerland and Belgium, where it peaked at number three, although it failed to chart in the United Kingdom, where it was released as a single about six months after the album. It has been the subject of numerous cover versions, most notably by the singer Suggs, whose version featured the  ragga duo, Louchie Lou & Michie One and reached number four in the United Kingdom in 1996."

        "content": "The song's origins lie in a late-night party attended by the duo and friends. The song's rhythm was developed by Simon, Garfunkel, and Simon's younger brother, Eddie. They recorded it for fun utilizing a Sony tape recorder and employing reverberation. In doing so, they were able to synchronize their live rhythm with the reverberating sound on the recording. A friend grabbed a guitar, strumming and punctuating the rhythm with \"aahs\". Simon later found himself coming back to the tape and its infectious quality. While listening to the recording, he composed the song's guitar line. Simon found a section, the length of shortly over a minute, that he felt had a nice groove. He and producer Roy Halee made a loop of this section, which was not an easy task before the advent of digital recording. The duo later recorded additional elements of the song at Columbia Records' Gower Street location in Hollywood, typically used for string section recording. Simon & Garfunkel dropped drumsticks on the parquet floor, incorporating their sound into the track. In addition, Simon played random notes on a xylophone, as those elements would be compressed in the final version to where it would not be audible whether or not they were correctly played. Drums were played by veteran Wrecking Crew drummer Hal Blaine. The lyric \"making love in the afternoon\" was among Simon's most explicit at the time. Simon states in the 2011 documentary The Harmony Game that, during the song's initial success, he came upon a recently returned Vietnam War veteran. The man told Simon that soldiers heard the song and found it a sign of the country's changing mores. In 2008, Stephen Colbert facetiously asked Simon why the narrator of the song would need to get up and wash his face after making love. Simon replied, \"Well, it's the '60s, so I can't remember.\""

The song is generally interpreted as a lament over a capricious lover who causes both anguish and jubilation to the singer. St. Cecilia is mentioned in another Paul Simon song, \"The Coast\" (from his 1990 album The Rhythm of the Saints): \"A family of musicians took shelter for the night in the little harbor church of St. Cecilia.\""

        "content": "\"Saint Dominic's Preview\" is the title song of the sixth album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, released in July 1972 by Warner Bros. It was recorded at the Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco in April 1972, with overdubs made later on. Morrison wrote it in a stream of consciousness in the same vein as some of his earlier works, particularly those on Astral Weeks. The  song's narrative moves from France to San Francisco, Morrison's place of residence at the time, to Belfast, where he grew up, to New York City (\"52nd Street apartment\"). Saint Dominic's Preview has been described as one of his most allusive, containing wide-ranging references including The Troubles, Morrison's pre-fame career cleaning windows, Notre-Dame cathedral and the vicissitudes of the recording industry. The song also mentions Edith Piaf, Irish poet W. B. Yeats, country singer Hank Williams and the California supermarket chain Safeway. Gary Mallaber and Jack Schroer (from the Moondance album) play drums and saxophone respectively and Morrison's then wife, Janet Planet, is one of the back-up vocalists. \"Saint Dominic's Preview\" has also been released on the live recordings It's Too Late to Stop Now and Van Morrison in Ireland, as well as the compilation album Still on Top - The Greatest Hits."

        "content": "It has been difficult for biographers and music reviewers to accurately identify some of the words used in \"Saint Dominic's Preview\"'s lyrics, as they were not published in the album sleeve at the time of its release. This led to some incorrect interpretations of the song before an official lyric sheet was published. The words emote different settings, but do not form an obvious story, as they describe a variety of subjects, such as cleaning windows, Edith Piaf's soul, W. B. Yeats and Hank Williams. \"Saint Dominic's Preview\" begins with references to Morrison's youth, working as a window cleaner in Belfast. He uses the word chamois (the leather used to clean windows) as a pun to link the French word to two aspects of French culture: singer Edith Piaf, with her song \"Non, je ne regrette rien\", and Cathedral Notre-Dame in Paris. The line \"It's a long way to Buffalo/It's a long way to Belfast city too\" is believed to refer to the homesickness that Morrison experienced living in the US at the time, because of the situation in Belfast. Whilst touring on the West Coast, drummer Gary Mallaber recalled a conversation he had with Morrison about how he missed Buffalo, New York: \"he wrote that [line] in 'Saint Dominic's Preview'. 'It's a long way to Buffalo/it's a long way to Belfast City too' \u2013 that was him crying out, saying, 'Well, you know what, I would like to return to my place too, 'cause I miss it.'\" Morrison revealed to journalists in 1972: \"I don't think I want to go back to Belfast. I don't miss it with all that prejudice around. We're all the same and I think it's terrible what's happening. But I think I'd like to get a house in Ireland. I'd like to spend a few months there every year.\" Morrison revealed that the song came to him in a stream of consciousness, but only found out afterwards that a mass that was  being held in a St. Dominic's church in San Francisco for peace in Belfast. He told John Grissim: There are also references to \"orange\" boxes, \"flags and emblems\" and people determined \"not to feel anyone else's pain\", which are seen by some as allusions to the situation in Belfast. Biographer Clinton Heylin thought that \"It was [a] surprising subject matter simply because of Morrison's long-standing decision not to address this volatile issue.\" Morrison later rejected the idea that the song had any political meaning, claiming that it was not written \"with anything in mind ... [it] is just a stream of consciousness. It doesn't mean any particular thing. It's a sketch ... the words, the syllables, just came out of my mouth and I wrote them down.\" In the lines \"You got ev'rything in the world you ever wanted/And right about now your face should wear a smile\", Morrison's personal life and successful career are covered, with references to the dishonesty of the music business, and his own self-pity and longing for a home that did not exist any more. Peter Mills identifies that the chorus is the element that brings the song together: \"Through it all, Saint Dominic's Preview remains. It is that which holds the song together, and unifies the apparently unconnected, resolving fracture through re-imagining what it means to belong: in this, the song is indeed a helpful observation of the situation in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s.\""

The band members present were Doug Messenger (guitar), Bill Church (bass), Gary Mallaber (drums), Tom Salisbury (piano), Jack Schroer and Jules Broussard (saxophones), with Janet Planet, Ellen Schroer and Mark Springer providing backing vocals as part of the Street Choir (Morrison's vocal backing group at the time). Jim Gaines, employed at the Wally Heider Studios, was the engineer at the session. Pianist Tom Salisbury made the arrangements for the song, along with  \"I Will Be There\" and \"Redwood Tree\", which were also recorded at the final session. Salisbury had perfect pitch, which made it easy for him to write down the charts over the phone with instruction from Morrison. Salisbury was happy with the first take, even though ten takes were eventually made during the session. Doug Messenger recalled: \"When we recorded \"St. Dominic's,\" every take was more powerful that the last. Quite an experience. Mallaber kept driving the band harder and harder.\" Producer Ted Templeman and his assistant Donn Landee were not present at the recording of \"Saint Dominic's Preview\", but oversaw the overdubs and retakes that were made to the song. The overdubs include Salisbury's organ part, which is cued in by the line \u2018Across the street from Cathedral Notre Dame\u2019, and John McFee's pedal steel guitar, intended to give a country feel to the line 'Every Hank Williams railroad train ... '. The electric guitar had to be rerecorded because of unwanted sound leaking into the microphone. Doug Messenger was no longer part of Morrison's band when the overdubs were being recorded, so numerous guitarists, including Ronnie Montrose, were brought in to play it. None produced the sound wanted, so Messenger was recalled, and managed to complete the overdub to Morrison's satisfaction in one take. Morrison also rerecorded his vocals, which, over the new backing, allowed him to react more to the music; \"no regrets\" was replaced with \"ne regrette rien\" and the vowel sound of \"wine\" was elongated to \"wi-ee-ine\". In the final recording, \"ne regrette rien\" is replaced by the Latin motto \"non regredior\" (\"I do not retreat\")."

Instrumentally it is very similar to 'Tupelo Honey'. The arrangement and vocals are joyously full-bodied ... However, the dense verbiage (more complex than on any other cut) is disjunctive and arcane, juxtaposing images of mythic travel, with those of social alienation.\" Janet Planet commented about the song: \"I am rather partial to 'St Dominic's Preview' if I had to pick one from the album. And I'm proud of our contribution. I really loved singing with him and I loved Ellen [Schroer] and Mark [Springer] \u2013 they were wonderful.\""

        "content": "\"Saint Dominic's Preview\" was one of the live performances included on Morrison's 1974 acclaimed live album, It's Too Late To Stop Now. It is also one of the songs performed on Morrison's first video Van Morrison in Ireland, recorded in February 1979 and released in 1981. It was Morrison's first concert in Belfast since 1967. The audience notably cheer when Morrison sings the lyric that mentions Belfast city. Morrison recorded a second studio version of the song for the Irish television program Sult at the Temple Bar, Dublin in April 1996. It was later released in August 1997 on the album Sult: Spirit of the Music with contributions from various Irish performers and groups. Clinton Heylin notes that when this recording was made was \"a time when the people of Northern Ireland were again praying for lasting peace ... Sung with a passion rare, the 1996 'Saint Dominic's Preview' reminded everyone watching that the time had come to reinstate these sentiments.\" Greil Marcus notes that Belfast and San Francisco were very different places in 1972 and 1996. This version begins with D\u00f3nal Lunny on bazouki playing in a minor mode, which Marcus believes \"could be the beginning of anything.\" To Marcus, Morrison's voice, which is much lower than it was on the original recording, gives the song a new meaning with \"a hint of violence\" through his \"harsh vowels\" and \"gruff tone\". He believed that the abundance of different parts at the end of the 1972 version \"was lost in a mass finale\", whereas the fact that all the parts came together in this version, represents the people \"marching as one, shouting for freedom, in the moment celebrating the truth that they already had it.\" The original recording was remastered in 2007 and included on the compilation album, Still on Top - The Greatest Hits."

Along with the track \"Baby Talk\", Idol's version of \"Mony Mony\" went to No. 7 on the Billboard dance chart. A live recording of the song became a hit for Idol in 1987 as well, while promoting his then-forthcoming compilation work Vital Idol. The live version was released as a single and went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, coincidentally displacing Tiffany's cover of another Tommy James song, \"I Think We're Alone Now\", from the top spot. It also finished directly behind the Tiffany song at No. 19 in the 1987 year-end Billboard chart. Idol's version gave rise to an interesting custom. When the song was performed live in concert or played at a club or dance, people would shout a certain formulaic (and usually obscene) variation of a particular phrase in the two measures following each line, for example, \"Hey, say what\u2026 get laid get fucked!\" Or \"Hey, motherfucker\u2026 get laid get fucked!\" This led to the song being banned at high-school dances across North America, although the custom continues at Idol concerts & sporting events today. It became so widespread that Idol would eventually commit the lyrics to record in the \"Idol/Stevens Mix\" of the song on the 2018 remix album Vital Idol: Revitalized. Idol revived interest in the original garage rock song. His original studio version can be found on Idol's Greatest Hits compilation album, a 2001 Capitol Records release. That album has received positive critical reviews, with Idol's cover of the James tune specifically praised."

It is about a recently divorced man complaining about his ex-wife taking everything he owns away from him in alimony payments. A cover version of the song appeared in Malcolm in the Middle Season 7 Episode 2 Health Insurance (2005) when Craig (David Anthony Higgins) threw a breakroom party for Lois (Jane Kaczmarek) celebrating her 10th anniversary at Lucky Aide; the show's fictional grocery store. Despite obvious changes to the lyrics, the cover otherwise followed the same melody as Idol's version with \"Mony Mony\" most notably replaced with \"Lois Lois\".

Frontman David McComb saw the potential of rap and hip-hop to reenergize rock's increasingly dull, uniform idiom and several numbers blend genres in modest but prescient ways.\" The Guardian said, \"Black Swan was intended to be the Triffids' White Album. As is the often the way with such things, it wasn't - though the band's leader, the late David McComb, certainly had no shortage of ideas on how acoustic and electronic music could be put together.

Penned by vocalist and frontman Dave Mustaine, the song received significant radio play and charted in various territories, making it one of Megadeth's best known songs. The song was generally well received by critics, and its accompanying music video by Wayne Isham initially received heavy rotation on MTV, but eventually became controversial and was edited because of an assassination scene that MTV felt was \"too harsh\". The video features each band member individually playing, with a mostly black-and-white nonlinear narrative revolving around a political candidate who is assassinated, and the massive amount of  anarchy and riots caused by the event. The song has been featured in several sources of media, and has been covered by several bands."

        "content": "Vocalist Dave Mustaine described, in Guitar Center Sessions, the development of \"Symphony of Destruction\" as stroke of luck. One day while driving down Riverside Drive in Toluca Lake, Los Angeles to his home, he was stricken by a headache.  Inspired, he began writing lyrics on the back of a sushi receipt, \" My metal brains corroding, my head is going to explode\". In 1992 Megadeth recorded the demo for what would become \"Symphony of Destruction\" and after some tweaking, the song was finished and recorded for inclusion on their fifth studio album, Countdown to Extinction. Originally, the first version of the song was much longer but was edited a lot during its pre-production for Countdown. Mustaine wrote the lyrics to the song, which were written about what he perceived to be how the masses were being led to their own destruction by political leaders, which is where the title is derived, Symphony of Destruction. The famous legend Pied Piper of Hamelin, is mentioned in the song and contains direct correlations to the lyrical meaning of the song. In the legend, the Pied Piper had the ability to force children and rats to follow his demands mindlessly, like the political leaders do to the public."

        "content": "\"Symphony of Destruction\" is 4 minutes, 7 seconds long. In the first five seconds of the song, the sound of an orchestra tuning is heard, followed by a short segment of vocals from the Offertorium, Domine Jesu Christe from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Requiem. The song then immediately shifts into a heavy guitar riff, which plays continuously throughout the duration of the song. The song contains what has been described as catchy, with a more commercially mainstream, standard song structure, as opposed to some of Megadeth's more aggressive and structurally intense songs, such as \"Hangar 18\" or \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\". By 1992, Mustaine's vocal performance and style, along with Megadeth's bombastic aesthetic, were considered jarring by some music listeners, meaning they had not yet been exposed to more mainstream audiences. Partially due to the success and radio friendliness of this song and Countdown to Extinction, Megadeth was capable of reaching a higher level of public awareness and cultural relevance."

        "content": "To promote the commercial success of the song as a single, Capitol Records produced a music video in 1992. Directed by Wayne Isham, who also directed the videos for \"Train of Consequences\" and \"99 Ways to Die\", the video begins with shots of a burning American flag with the motto For the People imprinted on it, followed by a gun trigger being pulled, and then a man's unblinking eye, foreshadowing the assassination that occurs later in the video. Each member of Megadeth separately appear playing instruments during the video, although none of them are actually seen playing together. Rioting crowds and anarchy are shown in contrast of political figures laughing, which leads to the President and First Lady exiting a limousine to a cheering crowd, where a man with a pistol appears and shoots the president. The remainder of the video consists of nonlinear footage of the band performing and miscellaneous destruction caused by the chaos inflicted by citizens and significant collateral damage. At first, the song was shown considerably on MTV without any concern, but later the scene where the politician finally gets assassinated was edited out because the assassination scene was deemed \"too harsh\". The edited version continued to be played on MTV, though to a smaller degree. The controversy was defended by Dave Mustaine, where he stated \"I think it's more important that our point got across than the fact of whether or not we had to soften up a certain scene or lose it altogether.\""

The song is also on their Dead Eyes See No Future EP. Nightwish also released a cover version, a live performance of the song is included in \"The Siren\" single and in the \"Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan\" single. Nightwish has continued to perform the song live, but these versions are not available on official releases. Also, by Tarja Turunen, although this has not appeared on any studio albums, Turunen has covered the song live, often transitioning to it from a cover of \"Dead Gardens\" by Nightwish. The original Megadeth version was remixed by Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor as \"The Gristle Mix\". Solo player Michael Angelo Batio released a cover of this song on the 2009 album Hands Without Shadows Pt.2: Voices, which featured Vinnie Moore and George Ballas. The song has even been covered by non-metal bands as well. For example, 3 Doors Down, an alternative rock act, played the song live nearly 70 times, which makes them one of its most devoted cover performers."

This chorus began in Argentina in 1994 and quickly spread worldwide. It can be loosely translated as 'Megadeth, Megadeth, go Megadeth'. 'Aguante' is an Argentinian slang term that means to \"hold on tight\", which represents to stick strongly to something, it's normally used in sports events to give support to the team players. It is also applied to something that \"rules\" or \"rocks\". The first time the Argentine crowd chanted this out, heavily influenced by its football song singing culture in stadiums, Dave Mustaine was blown out of his mind. This is a major reason that Argentina became one of his favorite countries to play in, as he states in the That One Night: Live in Buenos Aires DVD filmed in Argentina. Another is that \"it's the only public that will sing out the guitar parts\". The song remains Megadeth's most widely known song, and a live staple that has been performed in nearly all Megadeth concerts since its composition. Because of this, it has been featured in the following:"

Credited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards recording on \"Till the Next Goodbye\" began at Munich's Musicland Studios in November 1973. The song is a traditional ballad from the Stones' middle period, with slight country music influences. It opens with an acoustic guitar which leads into Jagger's performance. The lyrics deal with the \"illicit meetings between two lovers\"; The song's chorus is notable as the title is elongated into the phrase \"Till the next time we say goodbye.\" {{cquote|Yeah, a movie house on 42nd Street, Ain't a very likely place for you and I to meet; Watching the snow swirl around your hair and around your feet; And I'm thinking to myself 'she surely looks a treat'''}} In his review of the song, Bill Janovitz says, \"In the mid-'70s, a 42nd Street movie theater would have been a place of questionable repute and not a very romantic rendezvous. The lyric is unexpectedly complex; the point of view, Jagger as narrator, speaks to the mistress apologetically and with a guilty conscience... In one line on the bridge, Jagger manages to convey empathy, culpability, and frustration: 'I can't go on like this/Can you? Can you?' On paper it seems clear, the narrator is asking out of the relationship (paraphrasing): 'I can't do this, can you?' But the way Jagger sings it, it sounds like he's asking, 'You can't do this anymore, can you?' He's conveying a different meaning altogether, almost as if he is playing both parts in one line.\" Recording continued at Jagger's home in Newbury with the use of the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio and finished at Island Recording Studios in London. Jagger, Richards and Mick Taylor each perform acoustic guitar for the piece. Taylor also contributes electric slide guitar to the recording. Nicky Hopkins performs the song's piano. Bill Wyman performs bass while Charlie Watts performs drums. An overlooked song from the Stones canon of work, \"Till the Next Goodbye\" has never been performed live by the Stones and was not included on any compilation albums until the release of the Heartbreak'' EP in early 2021. The song was rehearsed on 11 February 2014 in Paris, in preparation for the Rolling Stones 14 On Fire Asia Pacific Tour, which started in Abu Dhabi on 21 February 2014.

It was released in February 1966 as a 7\" vinyl single through Motown records. It was written and produced by Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland. A gospel rock track, its lyrics detail a relationship that has ended. It has since been regarded as one of Four Tops' most successful singles ever. It charted moderately well in both the United States and Canada, and became the group's fifth consecutive entry to chart within the top five of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Four Tops has performed \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" on various occasions throughout their careers and have included it on several greatest hits albums, including on The Four Tops Greatest Hits (1967) and The Ultimate Collection (1997). American musicians Barbra Streisand and Carol Lloyd also recorded covers of \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" and released them commercially in 1975 and 1979, respectively. Included on her seventeenth studio album, Lazy Afternoon (1975), Streisand's version was more of a disco song, as accomplished by producers Jeffrey Lesser and Rupert Holmes. Following the success of the song in a New York City club, Columbia Records decided to release the single which would later become a moderate success on two Billboard dance charts in that same year. Critically, it was highlighted on Lazy Afternoon as a standout track. Lloyd's version was recorded for her debut record Score in 1979; it received heavy airplay by disc jockeys and was positively received by Billboard critics."

The album was a combination of \"current hits\" and \"crossover material\" to attract a larger audience for Four Tops. The song was written and produced by Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland, who had collaborated with Four Tops on various occasions in the past. It is written in the key of C major with the quartet's vocals ranging from G4 to D6. Set in a gospel rock tempo, lead singer Levi Stubbs begins stating, \"All through this long and sleepless night / I hear my neighbors talking\"; after losing the love of someone else, he claims that these people are \"Saying that, out of my life, into another's arms / You'll soon be walking,\" before entering the chorus. The American female group the Andantes provide background vocals for the track alongside the other three Tops. Motown released \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" as a 7\" vinyl single in February 1966. The standard edition commercial single features the B-side track \"Just As Long As You Need Me\".

According to Bill Dahl, author of Motown: The Golden Years, 1966 was a successful year for Four Tops due to the success of \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" and their others singles \"Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever\" and \"Reach Out I'll Be There\". At the time, the single was extremely popular in Boston, where it reached #37 on the \"Top Sellers in Top Markets\" chart in the aforementioned city.

        "content": "American vocalist Barbra Streisand recorded her own version of \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" for her seventeenth studio album, Lazy Afternoon (1975) in April 1975. Different from the original song, producers Jeffrey Lesser and Rupert Holmes gave the song a \"disco treatment\". Nicky Siano, a disc jockey, began playing the track at The Gallery nightclub in New York City in the fall of 1975. In a handwritten letter by Streisand for Siano, she wrote that the hype generated from playing her cover at the club prompted Columbia Records to release \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" as another single from Lazy Afternoon. In a 1979 Billboard article titled \"Everyone's Jumping on Disco Bandwagon\", written by columnist Paul Grein, he speculated that singers accustomed to the pop genre were beginning to \"releas[e] disco records\" and listed Streisand, Andy Williams, and Ethel Merman as a few examples. Following the release of the singer's disco-influenced \"The Main Event/Fight\" single in 1979, Grein listed both \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" and \"Love Breakdown\" as Streisand's previous attempts to create dance music. Streisand released the single in 7\" and 12\" vinyl formats on November 12, 1975. The United States and Canada version features B-side track \"Widescreen\", which also appears on Lazy Afternoon. The special edition \"Columbia Disco Series\" release was sent to dance clubs and features a stereo and mono version of \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\". A promotional release also took place that offered the short and long versions of the track, while the United Kingdom version (which was released on February 20, 1976) is similar to the United States/Canada one but contains the longer cut of the single instead of the album version."

        "content": "Critics liked Streisand's version of the track. Christopher Nickens and Karen Swenson, authors of The Films of Barbra Streisand, listed both \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" and \"Moanin' Low\" from Lazy Afternoon as two of the best songs from Streisand's entire career in 2000. Writer Will Hermes was also positive towards it, calling it a \"surprisingly soulful cover\". Derek Winnert, who wrote a biography on the singer in 1996, claimed that because of songs like \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" and album track \"By the Way\", the parent album was able to be appealing and thus a popular record. The author of True Colours: A Spectrum of Filipino Gay and Lesbian Online Writings, Nelz Agustin, felt that Streisand's cover was nostalgic and brought him back to the days of his youth. The success of \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" allowed it to enter two of the dance charts compiled by Billboard: it peaked at number 14 on the Dance Club Songs chart and number 10 on the now-defunct Disco Singles chart."

It was previously used as the B-side for her debut single, \"Score\", in September 1979. On Billboards Top Single Picks for the week of December 22, 1979, the editors listed Lloyd's version as a recommended track under the soul music category. In a review from the same publication, editor Barry Lederer called it the \"one exceptional cut\" on Score. Classifying it as a disco recording, he also found Lloyd's extended version of \"Shake Me, Wake Me\" to \"make th[e] already popular Streisand classic ever better\". The standard edition version, released exclusively in the United States, contained the single and B-side track \"Sundown to Sunrise\" while the promotional DJ single featured the stereo and mono versions of \"Shake Me, Wake Me\".

When recording tracks for their upcoming album The Age of Aquarius, producer Bones Howe suggested recording another Nyro song. 5th Dimension member Marilyn McCoo was then engaged to another member of the group, Billy Davis Jr., though they had not decided on an actual wedding date. In May 1969 the album was released. The first single released ahead of the album, \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\", was a tremendous hit, while the success of the second single, \"Workin' On a Groovy Thing\", was much more modest. When a disc jockey in San Diego began playing \"Wedding Bell Blues\" from the album, Soul City Records saw the song's potential, and in September 1969 it was released as a single. \"Wedding Bell Blues\" quickly soared to No. 1 on the U.S. pop singles chart, spending three weeks there in November, 1969 and made one of the group's somewhat rare appearances on the U.S. R&B singles chart, where it peaked at No. 23.  It was the group's second of five #1 songs on the U.S. adult contemporary chart. It was a top five hit in Canada, and placed in the top 20 on the UK Singles Chart\u2014and their only hit there except for the earlier \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\". It became a platinum record. In 1969 television appearances, McCoo sang lead vocal parts of the song to Davis, who would then respond with quizzical looks. The rest of the 5th Dimension's early hits had featured more ensemble singing, and McCoo's prominent vocal and stage role on \"Wedding Bell Blues\" might have led to her being more featured in the group's early 1970s productions."

Morrison had his first recording session as a solo artist for Bang Records in New York City for Bert Berns on 28 March 1967.

Unlike most of Summer's compilations, the 32-bit remastered Ultimate Collection includes the 16-minute album version of her breakthrough hit, \"Love to Love You Baby, the original 12\" versions of \"Theme from The Deep (Down Deep Inside)\", \"Last Dance\", \"Hot Stuff\", \"Bad Girls\", the original album or single versions of her biggest hits as well as the early European singles \"The Hostage\" and \"Lady of the Night\". Disc three contains live recordings from the 1978 album Live and More alongside a selection of rarities such as the 1990s remixes of \"I Feel Love\" and \"State of Independence\" and the full-length album versions of the 1979 duet \"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\" with Barbra Streisand and \"Je t'aime... moi non plus\" from the 1978 soundtrack Thank God It's Friday. An anomaly on this compilation is the heavily edited version of Summer's disco landmark \"I Feel Love\" appearing on disc one. While the original six-minute album\u2013single version has been included on a number of other career retrospectives, on the otherwise exhaustive three-disc Ultimate Collection the track is for some reason only three minutes eleven seconds in length. The Ultimate Collection, packaged in a double gatefold cardboard sleeve - although usually listed as a box set, was released by the Dutch label CCM, a subsidiary of Universal Music Holland. CCM has previously issued similar three-CD Ultimate Collections by artists like Grace Jones, Barry White, Diana Ross, Kool & The Gang, Dusty Springfield and others."

It also features another SM Entertainment group, Black Beat as well as Kim Bomi. The music video tells the story of a man (Jun Jin) and a woman (Kim Bomi) who are shown to be attracted to each other romantically.  However, another man (played by a member of Black Beat) shows romantic interest in the woman as well, thus initiating a fight between the Shinhwa and Black Beat members towards the end of the music video. \"First Love\", unlike the other two, does not show Shinhwa in a choreographed dance nor portray a story. It instead features various clips of Shinhwa, from practicing their choreographies to performing in concerts. \"Wedding March\", again starring Jun Jin as the main role, shows a man proposing to his love interest."

Other versions of \"Embryonic Journey\" were recorded by Kaukonen and featured on an album sharing the song's name. According to the album's liner notes, Kaukonen composed the tune in 1962 as part of a guitar workshop in Santa Clara and included it on Surrealistic Pillow at the band's behest. This song has been used in the film Purple Haze, the final Friends episode (entitled \"The Last One\"), in the movie The Rookie, in the movie Berkeley in the Sixties at the end with the credits, and recently in a UK television commercial for Norwich Union. It was also included on the A Walk on the Moon movie soundtrack and in Ken Burns's documentary series The Vietnam War."

It was named after a dream Alison Goldfrapp had about a \"very large tree\". Taking inspiration from paganism and surreal English children's books, Goldfrapp described the album as a \"sensual counterpoint to the glitterball glamour of Supernature\", their previous studio album from 2005. Seventh Tree became the duo's most critically acclaimed album since their 2000 debut Felt Mountain, with critics praising their new sound and their bravery for abandoning the dance atmosphere of their previous two albums. The album debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart with 46,945 copies sold in its first week. Four singles were released from the album. \"A&E\" was released as the lead single on 11 February 2008, peaking at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. The album's second single, \"Happiness\", peaked at number 25 on the UK chart, while the third single, \"Caravan Girl\", reached number 54. \"Clowns\" was released as the fourth and final single, charting at number 115 in the UK."

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 32 reviews. Barney Hoskyns of The Observer commented that the duo \"have made an album as hummably lovely as it is knowingly referencing of a certain tradition of neo-psychedelic English whimsy.\" Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club noted that the album is \"buoyed by an underlying pop sensibility, epitomized by the bubbly 'A&E;' and 'Caravan Girl'\", concluding, \"After the group's hit-or-miss synth-pop detour, Seventh Tree situates Goldfrapp where it was always meant to be.\" John Murphy of musicOMH viewed it as Goldfrapp's \"most subtle, affecting and rewarding album to date\" and compared it to Kate Bush and the Cocteau Twins. At AllMusic, Heather Phares praised the album's \"electro hippie-chic\" as the duo's \"most polished and luxe work yet\". John Lewis of Uncut called it \"brave, bonkers, often beautiful, sometimes haunting and occasionally ridiculous\". Adrien Begrand of PopMatters found that Seventh Tree \"might be a quieter and more introspective disc than we'd been expecting, but this is still a quintessential Goldfrapp album with Gregory's arrangements brilliantly underscoring the inimitable vocal versatility of his female foil.\" Despite being critical of Alison Goldfrapp's \"wispy, ethereal, often impenetrable vocal approach\", Dave Hughes of Slant Magazine opined that the album is \"most compelling for the way in which the band's regained austerity and naturalism contrasts with their more recent hedonism.\" Kat Lister of NME expressed that \"Seventh Tree is bound to ruffle a few electro-feathered fans, but there's no denying it's a venture that sets the pair into new experimental territory.\" In a mixed review, Rolling Stones Christian Hoard felt that the \"slow pace can be a snooze\", but wrote that the album \"still makes for good post-party chill-out music\". Nate Patrin of Pitchfork was less impressed, stating that the album's ambience is \"so subtle and slow-moving it doesn't seem to go anywhere, and it coasts on some frothy sense of pleasantness that evaporates the moment the song ends.\" Q magazine ranked the album at number 19 on its list of The 50 Best Albums of 2008. PopMatters placed it at number 54 on its list of The Best Albums of 2008. Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star included the album on his list of \"rock music that stuck in 2008\"."

This was a big step for music in Namibia and many thought Gazza has outshine The Dogg's fame. This album is therefore well known for bringing The Dogg back to his fame. This also proves some hidden lyrical and rhyming skills from The Dogg. During this album The Dogg can be compared to American rapper Nas when he did Stillmatic, an album which many claim resurrected Nas' career after being mocked by Jay-Z. The album has brought The Dogg back to his Kwaito Master status that he sold out on his previous release, Introducing TeeDee."

But is his debut worth more than a few hit singles?\"  He alluded to \"other than a few minor nitpicks, Heath has started off with a great debut.

Daniel Hinds of Outburn Magazine said the album \"took the band's brand of symphonic horror to a new level,\" commenting on that the ambient, synth-based instrumentals were a more subtle type of \"terror.\" Side-Line Music Magazine praised the dark tone of album's music created and effectiveness of the artwork.

The album was recorded during 2002 and 2003 in sessions at the Function 8 record label's studio in San Francisco, California. Production, instrumentation and songwriting was primarily handled by Guerrero, with contributions from producers Gadget and Monte Vallier. Rapper Lyrics Born and singer Gresham Taylor performed the few vocal tracks present on the album. Soul Food Taqueria consists mostly of downtempo, instrumental and sample-based chill-out music. It also incorporates influences from Latin soul, R&B, trip hop, and lo-fi music. Its cover artwork, depicting a taquer\u00eda that also serves soul food, was designed by artist Stephen Powers. The album did not receive significant promotion, and no radio singles were issued. While it did not appear on any record charts, Soul Food Taqueria was well received by most critics, who applauded its diverse style and production quality while deeming it an improvement from Guerrero's previous record, A Little Bit of Somethin (2000)."

Mostly handled by Tommy Guerrero, production for the album also featured audio mixing contributions from producer/engineers Gadget and Monte Vallier. Prior to these sessions, Gadget and Guerrero had previously worked together on independent label projects and collaborations, including their collaborational studio effort, Hoy Yen Ass'n (2000) for Function 8. Most of the instrumentation for the album was employed by Guerrero, while session drummer Chuck Treece and keyboardist Greg Galbreath also contributed to Soul Food Taqueria. All of the album's material was written and arranged by Tommy Guerrero. The album is primarily sample-based and instrumental, as recording and production followed a lo-fi and downtempo aesthetic. Gadget also assisted in vocal production for the album's three vocal tracks, \"Organism\", \"It Gets Heavy\" and \"Getting It Together\". In contrast to Guerrero's previous studio album A Little Bit of Somethin' (2000), production for Soul Food Taqueria was more polished, despite Guerrero stating that he is \"still down with the fucked up 4 track action\" upon the album's release. During recording, the instrumentation, sequencing and mixing were more detailed than its predecessor's, as noted by one critic who wrote \"everything sounds much more polished and in tune with their surroundings.\""

        "content": "Music writers note that the album was inspired by the San Francisco music scene, with AllMusic's Bryan Carroll citing the \"general street vibe of San Francisco's Mission district\". BBC Collective editor Matt Walton described the music as \"chillout music\". According to one music writer, the title of the album reflects its \"spicy fusion of soul, funk, hip-hop and Latin flavors stirred up in an intoxicating downtempo gumbo that is hard to resist\". According to Carmen Johnson of Prefix magazine, the album has Tommy Guerrero, a San Francisco-native, \"oozing soul in every track\". She also described the music of Soul Food Taqueria as \"an exploration into soulful, bass-heavy trip-hop that combines a lot of twists and sweeps through many genres and styles\". The album's music mixes 1970s soul music elements with Latin-style grooves, as well as R&B, samba, drum and bass, and trip hop. The songs also have a retro vibe. One writer noted the diverse musical elements of the album, writing that it contains a \"hybrid sound that\u2019s hard to categorize and easy to enjoy\". Several of the songs on the album are built on laid-back breakbeat samples. A notable influence on the music is the West Coast jazz of Chet Baker. Similar to Guerrero's previous work, which has been described as \"instrumental neo-funk\", Soul Food Taqueria encompasses influences from stripped down folk, jazz, lounge, guitar-blues, rock and minimal funk, as well as indie rock. Despite Guerrero's musical background, a CMJ columnist noted the album's similarity to New York City's experimental music scene, citing artists such as the Beastie Boys, Cibo Matto, JSBX and Luscious Jackson. Lily Moayeri of Remix Magazine noted the similarity of the album's \"low-key soul threaded through the understated funk\" to the work of underground artist Money Mark. Guerrero's guitar work for the album encompasses styles such as blues and flamenco music, and uses chord progressions and four note melodies, creating \"nimble and colorful pieces of musical texture\" when mixed in with the rest of the tracks' instrumentation. His guitar playing utilizes a minimal, acoustic and sparse sound and space blended with the live percussion of drummer Chuck Treece, Jupiter-heavy bass lines and keyboardist Greg Galbreath's synths. Vocals are more prevalent on the album than on Guerrero's previous recordings, with vocal tracks from rapper Lyrics Born of Blackalicious, Quannum and Latyrx fame, and long time friend and collaborator, lo-fi and indie pop singer-songwriter Gresham Taylor, credited as Gresham for the album."

        "content": "The minute-long intro track, entitled \"Lectric Chile Goat\", is a blues-based guitar instrumental performed alone by Tommy Guerrero. The album opener \"Abierto\" (open in Spanish) consists of low bass lines, allowing for guitar solo interplay that stylistically contrasts the bass, while bells jingle quietly with the drums. \"Organism\" contains predominant wah-wah guitar effects, which accompany a notable funk groove. \"Thank You (MK)\" is an ode to the tropics and features soft, jazz instrumentation. Guerrero's guitar arrangement for the song is reminiscent of the music of Brazilian bossa nova musician Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and American jazz saxophonist Stan Getz, with guitar licks similar to the playing-style of jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery. Accompanied by delicate harmonies, \"Tatanka\" is a funk-infused and bass-driven track that features intricate percussion and guitar riffs, as well as unique fret-work by Guerrero. The album contains three atmospheric break tracks, \"Train of Thought\", \"So Many Years Ago\" and \"And the Day Goes By\". One critic stated that the interludes \"render the ambience palpable\". The adumbral \"It Gets Heavy\" features melancholic lyrics and folk vocals by Gresham Taylor, which are similar to those of singer-songwriter John Secada. \"Thin Brown Layer\" has a noticeable Latin rhythm and guitar arrangement. The song also contains a predominant hypnotic beat, which, according to one music critic, \"makes you feel stoned even after completing a Twelve step program\". \"Terra Unifirma\", \"Another Brother Gone\" and \"Broken Blood\" are built around laid-back grooves and detailed guitar orchestrations. The moody \"It Gets Heavy\" features Guerrero and Gresham Taylor singing, and is reminiscent of trip hop artist Tricky, contributing to the album's general sound of hip-hop infected Latin soul. Its lyrics have been described as \"socially conscious but thought-provoking\". Cited by critics as the standout track on the album, Bryan Carroll described it as \"the sole hip-shaker among a gaggle of moodier pieces\". The bongo-driven track \"Lost Unfound\" has Guerrero occupying all instruments, and the album's third vocal track, \"Gettin' It Together\", features rapper Lyrics Born delivering a blend of emceeing and singing, which is a departure from his previous work. One music writer described the album's closing track, \"Falling Awake\", as \"the most beautiful song Guerrero\u2019s written to date\". The song contains melancholic piano arrangements. Another critic noted \"Falling Awake\"s meditative sound, writing that its light guitar melodies are \"slowly ascending on a journey of Satori\"."

Music journalists have noted the title and artwork as reflective of the album's musical influences. A columnist for the Santa Fe Reporter later described the artwork as \"totally cool, with a blocky style depicting some kind of Miami soul food/taco stand.\" Music journalist Kimberley Chun of the San Francisco Bay Guardian wrote of the concept, stating \"So what is a soul food taquer\u00eda? Do you get a side of collard greens with your menudo?\" In an interview with Chun, Guerrero discussed the concept and title, stating \"It's just this funny idea I had, growing up in the city \u2013 it's so diverse. The city itself is just down-home, down-to-earth, blue-collar, full of everyday kind of people. My music is along the same lines, just being simple \u2013 I just try to be honest in what I do.\""

Exclaim! editor Noel Dix observed an improvement in production and complexity of instrumentation by Guerrero from his earlier work, and stated, \"This record pours so much heart and emotion into it that you\u2019re bound to feel its warmth and splendor while it\u2019s bumping in your walkman as you trek the city streets.\" Noting that A Little Bit of Somethin was criticized as a \"lifeless piece of pop-trip-hop\", Brian Ho of Dusted praised Guerrero's artistic growth and found \"everything\" to be \"an improvement over its predecessor\", writing that the album \"is filled to the brim with body and life in a way that few albums can claim\". XLR8R critic Liz Cordingley called the album a \"nice case of dubby, electric guitar-driven downtempo\", and called its music \"dusty lo-fi soul that is seductively languid\". Joe Warminsky of the Washington City Paper praised Guerrero's minimalist approach to the album's chill-out sound, as the chill-out music genre mostly features implementation of a slicker production. He also compared the lo-fi grooves of Soul Food Taqueria to \"Shuggie Otis with Baja roots\". Carmen Johnson of Prefix Mag called it a \"stellar follow-up to 2000's A Little Bit of Somethin'\", and commended Guerrero for producing \"his own organic, subterranean blend of bohemian blues, hip-hop and salsa that's creative and adventurous\". Johnson called it \"the perfect soundtrack for the lazy days that hearken back to the end of summer.\" Some reviewers were less enthusiastic. Luke McManus of RT\u00c9 compared its songs to \"those jazzy Beastie Boys tracks\", and described the sound as \"undemanding and smooth\". However, McManus criticized the album's mood and wrote, \"Soporific, over polite and too damn quiet, Soul Food Taqueira veers dangerously close to snooze territory.\" Bryan Carroll of AllMusic criticized the predominance of \"mood pieces\", and stated, \"on the whole Soul Food Taqueria fails to stick to the ribs because it simply lacks the proper spice\". Other critics cited Guerrero's simple, inventive style and sound for the album as one of its better qualities. Bill Campbell of Ink 19 called the album an \"exemplary album ... 100% soul\". He also commended Guerrero's musicality, \"he constructs heartfelt music with a complexity few can pull off successfully\", as well as his guitar playing, as Campbell wrote \"his guitar work is subtle and works the spaces between the beats marvelously\". Canadian radio station CKUA ranked the album number 93 on its Best of 2003 Chart. Uptown contributor Anthony Augustine named Soul Food Taqueria as one of the Top 10 albums of 2003. In a January 2004 issue, Ulli Pfleger of Germany's publication of Rolling Stone ranked the album number two on his \"best of list\" of 2003."

        "content": "19 is the debut studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele released on 28 January 2008, by XL Recordings. Following Adele's graduation from the BRIT School in April 2006, she began publishing songs and recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend, who posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to interest from the record label. This led to Adele signing a recording contract at age 17 with the label and providing vocals for Jack Pe\u00f1ate. During this session for Pe\u00f1ate's song she met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce the majority of her debut album. Named after the age of the singer during its release and production, Adele wrote most of the album's material solely, but did work with a select few writers and producers including Jim Abbiss, Eg White and Sacha Skarbek. Their collaborations created a blue-eyed soul album with folk rock, indie pop, and jazz influences and lyrics describing heartbreak, nostalgia and relationships. Upon release, 19 received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Adele's vocal prowess and songwriting talent at such a young age and noted her as having the \"potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation.\" 19 also won numerous accolades including the Mercury Prize and the European Border Breakers Award. At the 51st Annual Grammy Awards, Adele won Best New Artist alongside Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Chasing Pavements\". Four singles were released from the album, with \"Chasing Pavements\" and \"Make You Feel My Love\" reaching the top ten on the UK Singles Chart, while the former became Adele's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also contains her first song, \"Hometown Glory\", written when she was 16, which is based on her home suburb of West Norwood in London. 19 became a global success, reaching number one in Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, while top 10 in fifteen countries including Australia, Brazil and the United States. The album is certified 8x platinum by the BPI with sales of over 2.4 million, while 3x platinum in the US by RIAA, having sold over 3 million copies. The album has sold over 6.5 million copies worldwide."

        "content": "Adele graduated from the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon in April 2006, where she was a classmate of Leona Lewis and Jessie J. Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent even though, at the time, she was more interested in going into A&R and hoped to launch other people's careers. Four months after graduation, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com. She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and given it to a friend. The friend posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to a phone call from Richard Russell, boss of the music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting. Nick Huggett, at XL, recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management, and in June 2006, Dickins became her official representative. September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major draw for Adele, a big fan of the British singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL in September 2006. Adele provided vocals for Jack Pe\u00f1ate's song, \"My Yvonne\", for his debut album Matin\u00e9e, and it was during this session she first met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce both the majority of her debut album, 19, and tracks on 21. Adele recorded a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Make You Feel My Love\" on the recommendation of her manager Jonathan Dickins, who loved the song. The first single released from 19 was \"Chasing Pavements\", which Adele wrote in collaboration with Eg White. \"Chasing Pavements\" was inspired by an incident Adele had with a former boyfriend of six months. After learning he had cheated on her, she went to the bar he was at and punched him in the face. After being thrown out, Adele walked down the street alone and thought to herself, \"What is it you're chasing? You're chasing an empty pavement.\" She sang and recorded it on her mobile phone and arranged the chords when she got home. Adele and White co-wrote two other songs for the album: \"Melt My Heart to Stone\" and \"Tired\". She also collaborated with Sacha Skarbek on the single \"Cold Shoulder\". However, most of the songs were written solely by Adele, including \"Best for Last\", \"Crazy for You\", \"First Love\", and \"My Same\", as well as her debut single, \"Hometown Glory\". That song was written by Adele in 10\u00a0minutes after her mother tried to persuade her to leave her home town of West Norwood in London for university."

        "content": "In July 2008, Adele informed noted UK soul writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul that the reason for naming her debut album '19' was to reflect her age while she was writing it: \"I just kinda remember becoming a bit of a woman during that time. And I think that is definitely documented in the songs.\" The Taiwanese edition was released on 5 March. As well as the standard track list, the album features three bonus tracks: \"That's It I Quit I'm Movin' On\" (\"Chasing Pavements\" B-side), \"Now and Then\" (\"Cold Shoulder\" B-side) and \"Painting Pictures\" (\"Make You Feel My Love\" B-side). The Indonesian special edition was released on 3 March. As well as the standard track list, the album features a bonus video for \"Chasing Pavements\". By 2008, Adele had become the headliner and performed an acoustic set, in which she was supported by Damien Rice. She embarked on a short North American tour in the same month, and 19 was released in the US in June. Billboard magazine stated of it: \"Adele truly has potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation.\" The An Evening with Adele world tour began in May 2008 and ended in June 2009. She later cancelled the 2008 US tour dates to be with a former boyfriend. She said in Nylon magazine in June 2009, \"I'm like, 'I can't believe I did that.' It seems so ungrateful.... I was drinking far too much and that was kind of the basis of my relationship with this boy. I couldn't bear to be without him, so I was like, 'Well, OK, I'll just cancel my stuff then.'\" By the middle of October 2008, Adele's attempt to break in America appeared to have failed. But then she was booked as the musical guest on the 18 October 2008 episode of NBC's Saturday Night Live. The episode, which included an expected appearance by then US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, earned the program its best ratings in 14 years with 17\u00a0million viewers. Adele performed \"Chasing Pavements\" and \"Cold Shoulder\", and the following day, 19 topped the iTunes charts and ranked at number five at Amazon.com while \"Chasing Pavements\" rose into the top 25. The album reached number 11 on the Billboard 200 as a result, a jump of 35 places over the previous week."

        "content": "19 received generally positive reviews from critics. The album holds a 68 out of 100 rating, based on 19 critical reviews, at Metacritic. The Observers Caspar Llewellyn Smith wrote in his review, \"The way [Adele] stretched the vowels, her wonderful soulful phrasing, the sheer unadulterated pleasure of her voice, stood out all the more; little doubt that she's a rare singer, which another track first available on her MySpace site, 'Daydreamer', confirmed\" they gave the album a five-star response. \"Pitching up somewhere between blues, folk and jazz, she's included something for everyone without ever pandering to a particular trend\", wrote Chris Long from BBC Music. \"Her melodies exude warmth, her singing is occasionally stunning and, in the dramatic Hometown Glory, the spiky cool of Cold Shoulder (which is unexpectedly reminiscent of Shara Nelson-era Massive Attack) and the piano epic Make You Feel My Love, she has tracks that make Lily Allen and Kate Nash sound every bit as ordinary as they are.\" Chuck Taylor said in Billboard that \"Adele truly has potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation.\" Mikael Wood was less impressed in Entertainment Weekly, writing that \"Adele's songs aren't as sharp as Duffy's...Still, her singing throughout is a thing to behold.\" Uncut was more critical, believing that \"Adele can certainly sing, but '19' reeks of some A&R trendhound making it his/her biz to sign The New Amy and not resting till s/he's found the right chick from South London to fit the bill\". According to NME, \"as '19' reveals itself, it's clear that the Amy associations are little more than empty mediaspeak without any real weight. Despite the early indicators, there's precious little on the album that prevents it from collapsing under the weight of its own expectation\". Adele became the first recipient of the Brit Awards Critics' Choice and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008. The Times Encyclopedia of Modern Music named 19 an \"essential\" blue-eyed soul recording. The album was nominated for the 2008 Mercury Prize in the category of Best Album. She also won an Urban Music Award for \"Best Jazz Act\". She also received a Q Awards nomination in the category of Breakthrough Act and a Music of Black Origin nomination in the category of Best UK Female. On 3 December 2008, the album spawned four Grammy Award nominations: Best New Artist for Adele, and Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Chasing Pavements\". The following year, she received a second consecutive nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, for \"Hometown Glory\", but lost to \"Halo\" by Beyonc\u00e9. Her success occurred simultaneously with several other British female soul singers, with the British press dubbing her a new Amy Winehouse. This was described as a third British Musical Invasion of the US. However, Adele called the comparisons between her and other female soul singers lazy, noting \"we're a gender, not a genre\". AllMusic wrote that \"Adele is simply too magical to compare her to anyone.\" Following the release of her debut album 19, Kanye West and Beyonc\u00e9 were among the artists vocal in their praise of her music. Beyonc\u00e9 cited Adele as one of the influences for her fourth album, 4."

The bilingual English-Irish version (2:56) replaced the original pure Gaelic version (2:34) on subsequent pressings of Shepherd Moons from mid-1992 onwards, making the original recording relatively rare. Despite being nominated for a Razzie, \"Book of Days\" became Enya's second top-ten single on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 10, and reached number 12 on the Irish Singles Chart. It was used as a temp track during the editing of James Cameron's film Titanic, for the scene eventually accompanied by the musical cue called \"Take Her To Sea, Mr. Murdoch\" on the finished soundtrack by James Horner."

It preceded the album by three months, but is somewhat unrepresentative of the overall sound of its parent album. It bears similarities with \"Wide Open Space\" and \"Closed for Business\"; two of the band's most popular singles. The song references the Marquis de Sade. The song's name was later used as the title for the groups retrospective compilation Legacy: The Best Of Mansun in 2005 . The closing refrain \"Nobody cares when you're gone\" were later reused as the title of a documentary about the group included on DVD editions of the Legacy: The Best Of Mansun compilation. The music video was directed by Mike Mills. After the controversial \"Taxloss\" video it is probably their most unconventional and well known video. The video parodies the group and others like themselves, sending up the clich\u00e9s of male pop and rock bands and the experience of the music industry. The entirety of the video is performed by simplistic and jerkily animated puppets against unconvincing but humorous cardboard backdrops."

        "content": "The single was released in the final week of 1998 that allowed singles to have four tracks on each format. The new chart rules were instated the following week that meant that singles could only be eligible to chart with three tracks per format. The four-track EP was nostalgically valued by many musicians; this compromised the Mansun releases which had offered value and incentives to fans by cramming numerous B-sides on each format. For example, \"Legacy\" provided a wealth or a plethora of content depending on a person's disposition by having five original B-sides, a remix, two versions of \"Legacy\" and two acoustic re-recordings across the single's four formats. After the instatement of the new chart rules ineligible four-track EPs were released as statements by musicians; the premise was to elevate the material as being a whole as opposed to a commercial pop hit. 3 Colours Red's EP Paralyse (1998) and Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys? (2006) by Arctic Monkeys are examples of the practice. The chart rules were revised in October 2007 allowing four-track releases under the 'Maxi' name."

        "content": "In 1971, after the relative failure in sales of What About Today? Columbia Records continued with the desire to modernize the singer's repertoire, but this time the choice to produce the singer's album was Richard Perry who chose songs by contemporary artists such as: Joni Mitchell, Gordon Lightfoot, Harry Nilsson and Laura Nyro. The album cover photography was taken at Sunrise Mountain, Nevada by Barry Feinstein. When Columbia promoted the singer's next album Barbra Joan Streisand, it announced in magazines that Stoney End is like the artist's first album, given the large number of people who discover her songs since the record. The song \"Stoney End\", composed by Laura Nyro, was released in the US as the lead single and charted at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 2 on the Adult Contemporary chart and also reached number 27 on the UK singles chart. \"Time and Love\" reached Number 51 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 3 on the AC Chart. \"Hands Off the Man\", the final single, was officially titled \"Flim Flam Man\" (and backed with \"Maybe\"). It spent 5 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at 82."

William Ruhlmann, from AllMusic website, has retrospectively given the album four and a half (out of five) stars, and called it \"not a perfect album, but it was so far removed from what Streisand's fans and her detractors thought her capable of that it stands as one of her major triumphs\". The review also mentioned: \"whereas (The Barbra Streisand Album, 1963) had redefined the role of the traditional pop singer in contemporary terms for the early '60s, Stoney End redefined Streisand as an effective pop/rock singer\". Alex Dubo from Rolling Stone gave the album a mixed review which he wrote that \"Stoney End runs hot and cold. Some of the cuts are really dynamite and some are holdovers from the days of musical comedies\". He laso wrote that the album \"shows that Barbra Streisand can sing, and could be relevant, although I don't expect droves of rock fans to rush out and buy this\"."

The video shows two versions of the band performing the song. In one room, the band is performing while dressed entirely in black with sunglasses, similar to characters in the Matrix films. This room is a representation of the computer virtual reality, known as the Matrix from the film trilogy. Vocalist Sonny Sandoval is shown demonstrating abilities often used in the film by individuals who are aware of the nature of the Matrix, particularly the character Neo (the ability to warp the reality of the Matrix) to move objects via computerized telekinesis, in this case alphabet nursery blocks and form the word \"ONE\" from the word \"NEO.\" (Neo is the central character in the Matrix films). The second room is a representation of the \"real world\" outside of The Matrix, and the band in this room are dressed in similar fashion to the Zionites in the Trilogy, garbed in old, and dirty clothes, although the level of degradation in the garments worn by the Zionites in the film is significantly more apparent than those worn by the band members in the music video. The two realities are shown to be mirror-images of each other, positioned and moving in the same manner as each other - the band in the Matrix are playing their instruments left-handed to further touch on the theme. At the video's end, the song's final note shatters the glass separating the two rooms, thus allowing the two bands to see each other. \"Sleeping Awake\" marked the P.O.D. video debut of guitarist Jason Truby. During shooting of the video, Sandoval confessed that while the band had seriously considered breaking up after the departure of Marcos Curiel (who has since rejoined the band), \"[Jason] did us a favor by helping us out with this song, and then once it was all said and done it kind of confirmed that maybe we should keep doing what we loved\u2014and that's making music...

John Zorn regularly held collaborations at the Knitting Factory, and Buckley performed vocals on the tracks \"Taipan\" and \"D.Popylepis\" that appeared on 1992 album John Zorn's Cobra: Live at the Knitting Factory. Buckley contributed vocals on \"Jolly Street\" from The Jazz Passengers' 1994 album In Love, and he played six string bass and drums on tracks from his ex-girlfriend Rebecca Moore's album Admiral Charcoal's Song. Buckley also performed backup vocals and guitar on Brenda Kahn's \"Faith Salons\" which was released on her 1996 album Destination Anywhere. On Patti Smith's 1996 album Gone Again, Buckley provided vocals on \"Beneath the Southern Cross\" and played esraj on \"Fireflies\". He co-wrote \"Despite the Tears\" with Chris Dowd, then lead singer of The Seedy Arkhestra, for the album Puzzle, co-produced by Dan Siegler and also contributed vocals and guitar on two more tracks, \"A Thousand Tears\" and \"Flog Your Dead Horse\". Buckley's drummer Matt Johnson played on the album as well, along with Joan Wasser and Joseph \"Amp\" Fiddler. Dowd had previously co-written \"What Will You Say\" with Buckley and Carla Azar, which appeared on Mystery White Boy. Buckley also collaborated with other musicians on different projects. He appeared on the soundtrack of First Love, Last Rites, performing vocals on \"I Want Someone Badly\" backed by the group Shudder to Think. This song later appeared on Grace (Legacy Edition).

        "content": "Since Jeff Buckley only completed one album, many posthumous releases, as well as bootlegged unreleased live recordings, have proved popular with fans. These recordings come from all periods of his career; in particular, Buckley made many soundboard recordings of the concerts from his 1995\u20131996 tours. Mary Guibert, his mother and head of his estate, expressed an interest in releasing these live concerts as a special subscription series, leaving the recordings uncut: \"warts and all\". However, this project has yet to come to fruition. A number of Buckley's 4 track demos for My Sweetheart the Drunk have been leaked over the internet but the majority of the demos from this period have remained out of the public domain. Michael Tighe has made reference in particular to one track, \"Sky Blue Skin\", that he personally feels is a very important song of Buckley's (the track was finally released in 2019). Other names of unreleased songs from the demos have circulated amongst fans including: \"The Morning After\", \"Open Up and Bleed\", \"Dendrils of Death\", \"Don't Listen to Anyone But Me\", and \"Pleasure Seeker\". A version of \"Dendrils of Death\" has been recorded by Buckley's old bassist, Mick Grondahl, and his band Tongue. Certain live performances by Buckley have specifically been held in high regard. \"Dido's Lament\", an aria from Dido and \u00c6neas by Henry Purcell, was performed live at the Meltdown festival in 1995, directed by Elvis Costello. The falsetto operatic piece is unusual in Buckley's catalogue, having similarities only with Buckley's version of \"Corpus Christi Carol\" featured on Grace. The  Meltdown festival also featured a particularly beautiful version of \"The Other Woman\".  Although unreleased, an excerpt of this version of \"Dido's Lament\" has appeared on the soundtrack of BBC documentary Everybody Here Wants You. \"Edna Frau\" was written with Mick Grondahl, Buckley's bassist and was performed live on at least one occasion on The Hard Luck Tour. Grondahl also sings on this song and it was the only occasion he did so during the time he was a member of Buckley's band. Other popular recordings are a performance of \"We All Fall in Love Sometimes\" by Elton John and Bernie Taupin recorded on October 11, 1992, for WFMU's \"The Music Faucet\" and \"Three is The Magic Number\", by Schoolhouse Rock, from Buckley's Mercury Lounge 1996 New Year's Eve concert. Michael Tighe also mentioned Buckley's collaboration with Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins, describing \"All Flowers in Time Bend Towards the Sun\" as a beautiful piece worthy of release. Buckley contributed to a piece of music about alien abduction called \"Ozark Melody\". The song was recorded in the middle of 1996, with lyrics written by Joe Tripician while the music was composed by Buckley and Frederick Reed. This song is available to download on the internet with permission from the Estate of Jeff Buckley, but has not had an official release."

It was first released in the United States and took Gloria to the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks top position. The song reached the No. 1 spot on the chart, and was her first No. 1 hit since the Spanish version of \"Don't Wanna Lose You\" in 1989. It was also a hit on other markets (like the dance market), where it became Gloria's first Spanish single to ever reach the Top 5 of the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. This song was also Gloria's first No. 1 in Spain, which led the album to become the most successful album released in the country for its sales of more than a million. The song was one of the first Spanish-language songs to reach the Top 40 on some English language countries like the United Kingdom, a record-breaking honor which would set the tone for the success of future Latin-American and Hispanic artists. The remixes for the song were made by Gloria Estefan's personal remixer Pablo Flores and by Tommy Musto. The song was played as a wake-up call for NASA astronaut Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez aboard the space shuttle mission STS-128. A rerecorded version was included in Estefan's 2020 album, Brazil305."

On the club remix, he said it's \"effectively reconstructed for her newly rediscovered club following. Track tempers the original song's kinetic percussion and Glo's fierce singing with a wriggling deep-house groove and ambient keyboards.\" The Daily Vault's Mark Millan called the song \"intoxicating\". Anne Hurley from Entertainment Weekly stated that \"moods flow from intense yearning\" and it is a \"meditation on longing for one's homeland\". Music writer James Masterton noted in his weekly UK chart commentary, \"It is the first time she has ever charted a single sung in Spanish, which may restrict its appeal somewhat.\" Alan Jones from Music Week rated it three out of five, adding that \"the older occasional singles buyer will be lured to this by its traditional Latin-drenched original mix, while dance fans will skip it for Tommy Musto and Pablo Flores' muscular house mixes. Regular Estefan fans are more likely to give it a miss altogether.\" Tim Jeffery from the magazine's RM Dance Update described it as \"a nice summery Latin number\"."

The two began recording the album in early 2007 using a revolving door of contributing musicians. The album is heavily influenced by chamber and orchestral music and jazz, and features an abundance of woodwinds. It is widely considered to be Kayo Dot's least heavy album to date. The ensuing tour featured a mostly new group of musicians: Patrick Wolff on woodwinds, Daniel Means on woodwinds and guitar, David Bodie on drums, and Terran Olson on woodwinds and keyboards.

It was then that vocalist Jacoby Shaddix announced the album's planned release date of August 26. However, Shaddix later mentioned the album's release date had been pushed to March 2009 on Pulse Radio, citing, \"We want a new fresh year, a great start.\" M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce lead guitarist Mick Mars played the guitar solo on the track \"Into the Light\". On October 26, 2008, the song \"Hollywood Whore\" was released as a music video through the band's official fan club website, before being formally released as an EP in Canada two days later. In other regions, the song became available as a digital single through iTunes. The song \"Change or Die\" is featured on the video game \"UFC Undisputed 2009\".

Too many times the band takes one step forward and two steps back, at least showing some minimal signs of life in a dying genre built on repetition. Shaddix has a solid voice for this sound, and Horton seems to be discovering a new use for his distortion pedal, there are just far too many cliches in the ocean Papa Roach is trying to swim across, and the band can't seem to cope with their identity.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic observes that the album has \"a dire determination to its purported good times, it's riffs grinding instead of greasy, its rhythms clenched where they should be loose. While Papa Roach is a long long way from the depths of Hinder \u2014 that decade of work does give the band a professional snap, plus it never quite seems that Jacoby Shaddix's heart is into slagging that 'Hollywood Whore' he berates on the album's first single \u2014 they miss the whole point of this kind of rock & roll raunch: it should be more fun to listen to than it is to take out on the road.\""

Her individual phrasing, her highly distinctive mannerisms are in the grooves. [...] For the dealer with any jazz trade at all, this package is virtually a must.\" The record's reputation has grown since its release. In Bebop: The Best Musicians and Recordings, jazz commentator Scott Yanow notes simply of the album that \"[e]verything works\", making of it an \"essential acquisition\". Ink Blot Magazine, characterizing this as one of Vaughan's \"jazziest\" albums, describes it also as one of her greatest. In its review, All Music states that \"Vaughan is arguably in the best voice of her career here\" and praises Brown for \"displaying his incredible bop virtuosity\", indicating that \"[i]n whichever incarnation it's reissued, Sarah Vaughan With Clifford Brown is one of the most important jazz-meets-vocal sessions ever recorded,\" although All Music is incorrect in suggesting that the album was retitled; Brown's name has been highlighted on some reissues of the album since 1990 although most reissues duplicate the original album cover. The Blackwell Guide to Recorded Jazz, also praising Brown's \"brilliant\" trumpeting, delves into Vaughan's vocal stylings in detail, encouraging listeners of the album to note how \"sometimes she stretches out a song so deliberately and so reconfigures its melody, that the lyrics lose sense, linguistic phrasing having been replaced by musical phrasing\". Blackwell author Barry Dean Kernfeld opines that \"[i]t is perhaps this pure devotion to the exploration of sound that has made her such a favourite of jazz listeners\". In Jazz: A Critic's Guide to the 100 Most Important Recordings, New York Times jazz commentator Ben Ratliff placed the album as among Vaughan's best, indicating that the recording session seemed among those blessed sessions where \"even middle-level musicians can sound like gods\". The Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested \"Core Collection,\" stating \"it is very difficult to find any flaw in what should be recognized as one of the great jazz vocal records,\" and awarded it \"crown\" status. But even while praising the album, some critics found elements of fault. Ratliff expresses distaste for the album's \"shizy moments, when...[Vaughan] rockets between hoity-toity...and so blues-singer earthy, in certain low-register moments, that she approaches vulgarity\". A review in the music magazineMetronome at the time of its first release lamented: \"Sarah sounds like an imitation of herself, sloppy, affected and so concerned with sound that she forgets that she is a singer, forgets the lyric of the song itself to indulge in sounds that are meaningless.\" Kernfeld suggests that Herbie Mann is a weak element amongst the otherwise strong ensemble, \"completely overmatched\", although The Penguin Guide to Jazz disagrees with this assessment."

The album marked the second collaboration with the French songwriter and singer Jean-Jacques Goldman who had already written her 1993 hit single \"Il me dit que je suis belle\". To date, Kaas continues to be associated with Goldman for the composing of her songs, and this collaboration remains one of the most important of the singer's career. The album was recorded in New York, but also in Paris, and produced by the singer and Phil Ramone, who had previously worked with artists such as Ray Charles, Billy Joel and Paul Simon. The album was also composed by several famous contributors : for example, the American songwriter and singer Lyle Lovett, with the song \"Chanson simple\" (Eng: \"Simple song\"), and James Taylor with \"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\" (the song, the last track, is performed as a duet). French artists participated in the writing of the album, such as Didier Barbelivien, who had also worked with Kaas for her previous studio album, and Zazie. Philippe Bergman, who co-wrote three songs of this album, was Kaas' boyfriend at the time. In France, two singles were released from this album : \"Quand j'ai peur de tout\" (Eng: \"When I'm afraid of everything\") in February 1997, which reached #11 and achieved Silver status, and \"Je voudrais la conna\u00eetre\" (Eng: \"I Want to Know Her\") in July 1997, which peaked at #20. The first single, \"Quand j'ai peur de tout\", was written by Diane Warren and was successfully covered in English-language in 2003 by the pop band Sugababes, but the song was re-entitled \"Too Lost in You\"."

It hit Gold certification in 1997. In Finland, Dans ma chair was charted from the early 1997 and peaked at #8 in its third week, after a debut at #12. It featured for 17 weeks in the top 40. In other countries, the album was less successful even if it met slightly good sales, peaking at #16 in Germany, #27 in Belgium (Flanders) (it remained on the chart for eight weeks, from April 12 to June 14, 1997), #45 in Austria where it was charted for three weeks and #77 in the Netherlands where it appeared for five weeks."

        "title": "Wreck on the Highway (Bruce Springsteen song)_Summary",
        "content": "\"Wreck on the Highway\" is a song written and performed by Bruce Springsteen.  It was originally released as the final track on his fifth album, The River.  The version released on The River was recorded at The Power Station in New York in March\u2013April 1980.  As well as being the last track on The River, it was the last song recorded for the album. A melancholic song with a false ending, \"Wreck on the Highway\" features prominent organ and acoustic guitar parts.  The song is structured as a folk ballad with four verses of five lines each.  The rhyming pattern of the verse endings is generally A-B-C-C-B, but this is not followed absolutely strictly.  The lyrics describe a man who witnesses a hit-and-run auto accident on a rainy, isolated highway, and is subsequently haunted by the vision and unable to sleep.  After the first three verses focus on the specific incident, the last verse broadens the theme to encompass more universal themes of life and death.  The singer thinks about the life that was lost, and the people who may have loved him, and he knows he will be haunted by the incident for the rest of his life.  Springsteen has explained the theme by stating that after seeing the accident the singer \"realizes that you have a limited number of opportunities to love someone, to do your work, to be part of something, to parent your children, to do something good.\"  It is directly inspired by Roy Acuff's country song of the same name and similar theme from the 1940s, which is a cover version of the 1938 recorded song, \"I Didn't Hear Nobody Pray\", by the Dixon Brothers. While Springsteen's song has elements of a country arrangement, its music is more haunted and less sentimental. Along with the title track, \"Independence Day\" and \"Point Blank\", it is one of the verse-chorus songs on The River that was essentially a short story or character sketch. \"Wreck on the Highway\" and a few other songs on The River, such as the title track and \"Stolen Car\", mark a new direction in Bruce Springsteen's songwriting: these ballads imbued with a sense of hopelessness anticipate his next album, Nebraska, as well as a turn towards pessimism in his overall artistic and personal world-view. Springsteen himself has noted that \"Wreck on the Highway\" is one of the songs reflecting a shift in his songwriting style, linking The River to Nebraska. A slow-tempo song, \"Wreck on the Highway\" has not been particularly common in concert, with about 100 performances in Bruce Springsteen concerts through 2008.  Nearly all of those performances occurred during the 1980\u20131981 River Tour. The song was revived occasionally for electric piano performances on the 2005 solo Devils & Dust Tour. Naturally, the song was played every night during the 2016 \"River Tour\" during which the entire album was played at the outset of each show. In the UK, it was released as the B-side of the single \"Cadillac Ranch\"."

        "content": "Author Patrick Humphries describes the song as distilling \"the essence of what makes Bruce Springsteen great: a looping, loping and involving melody, heartfelt vocal and acutely visual lyrics.\"  June Skinner Sawyers describes it as \"a perfect song, a masterpiece in miniature, and a haunting meditation on mortality and what it means to be alive.\"  Music critic Clinton Heylin described the version that was released on the album as a \"near-cataleptic coda to 'Drive All Night,'\" the previous song on the album, although Heylin felt that an earlier version of the song, with a faster, \"countrabilly\" arrangement, was more interesting.  Heylin also described the song as Springsteen's \"semi-ironic farewell to albums about cars and girls.\"  Music critic Dave Marsh describes the song as an appropriate closer for The River as it \"pares down the situation from 'Drive All Night'\" of the singer and his lover trying to ignore the distractions around them down \"to one man facing the world again.\"  To Marsh, the singer in \"Wreck on the Highway\" may well have been the hero from other songs on The River such as \"Ramrod,\" \"Cadillac Ranch,\" \"The River\" or \"Stolen Car,\" or even the heroes from earlier Springsteen albums such as Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town, but regardless Marsh feels that \"he sees and speaks and sings for all of them.\""

        "content": "The discography of American rapper Big Boi consists of three studio albums, one mixtape, twenty-two singles, five promotional singles and twenty-five music videos. Big Boi initially achieved success as a member of the hip hop duo Outkast with fellow rapper Andr\u00e9 3000; they have recorded and released six studio albums together, and the singles \"Ms. Jackson\", \"Hey Ya!\" (performed solely by 3000) and \"The Way You Move\" (performed solely by Big Boi) have all topped the US Billboard Hot 100. In 1995, Big Boi made a guest appearance on the single \"Dirty South\" by American hip hop group Goodie Mob, which peaked at number 92 on the Billboard Hot 100. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, he made several other appearances on commercially successful singles, including \"All n My Grill\" by rapper Missy Elliott, \"A.D.I.D.A.S.\" by rapper Killer Mike and \"Girlfight\" by singer Brooke Valentine; these songs charted on the Billboard Hot 100. Big Boi released his first two solo singles \u2013 \"Royal Flush\" and \"Sumthin's Gotta Give\" \u2013 in 2008, with \"Ringtone\" following in 2009. All three songs were recorded for his purported debut studio album Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty: however, due to legal complications resulting from Big Boi's departure from his former record label Jive Records, the album's release was considerably delayed and was not released until 2010. The eventual first single from Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty, titled \"Shutterbugg\", peaked at number 60 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, as well as number 32 on the UK Singles Chart and number 13 on the UK R&B Chart. The album spawned the single \"Follow Us\", a collaboration with rock group Vonnegutt. Following its eventual release, Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty debuted at number 3 on the US Billboard 200, and appeared on several other national album charts. Big Boi's second studio album, Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors, was released on December 11, 2012 in the United States, and peaked at number 34 on the Billboard 200 in the first week following its release. The album was preceded by the release of the singles \"Gossip\", \"She Said OK\" and \"Mama Told Me\"."

Walker wrote three tracks (\"Ships in a Bottle\", \"Vessels\", and \"The 3 Kids In Brooklyn\") prior to the Malibu house fires that took his home in November 2007.  These tracks were made available on Walker's Myspace site in demo form in late 2007. Butch stated in an interview with InklingsTV that \"[the fires] made [him] feel like [he] had something to prove, something that [he] needed to say\".  The physical packaging of the album is, according to Walker, very 'bare-bones', because he wanted it to be 'all about what's on the disc'. The album was acclaimed by music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100, Sycamore Meadows holds a rating of 81/100, indicating universal acclaim. Butch released an online-only video for the first single \"Ships in a Bottle\" through his Myspace website on September 15, 2008. The music video for the second single \"The Weight of Her\" premiered on Amazon.com on November 24, 2008. A special 180-gram vinyl-edition release of Sycamore Meadows was made available for the 2008 holiday season."

The album featured contributions from many of the same session musicians and friends that had played on Hansson's previous album, Magician's Hat.  In Hansson's native Sweden, Attic Thoughts was released with the Swedish title of Mellanv\u00e4sen. It was released with its English title in April 1975 by Charisma Records, but was less commercially successful than Hansson's preceding solo albums and failed to reach the charts in the UK or the United States.  In addition to featuring Hansson's usual blend of other-worldly progressive rock and fairy tale-like ambiance, Attic Thoughts includes a suite named \"Rabbit Music\", which was inspired by Richard Adams' novel Watership Down, a subject that Hansson would explore further on his 1977 album Music Inspired by Watership Down."

        "content": "Peter McCann would recall his inspiration for writing \"Right Time of the Night\": \"I was out at the beach at Malibu, and it was one of those perfect sunsets. I was there for the entire evening, and the sun went down and the stars came out. But...and it was totally accidental - I didn't mention the beach [or] anything like that [in the lyrics] because that would have regionalized [the song].\" McCann had been working as a staff writer for American Broadcasting Music for roughly a year without composing a high-profile song: (Peter McCann quote:) - \"I played ['Right Time...'] for [boss] Gerry Teifer...For the first time...he let me play [a] whole song through, and then he did something he'd never done before. He said: 'Play that again.' I played it again, and he goes: 'Wait here.' He brought in everybody in the building who was working there and said 'Play it.' I played it, and they all cheered and went nuts. I thought it was just another song I had written, but apparently not.\" As originally written and as recorded by Peter McCann for his 1977 self-titled album, \"Right Time of the Night\", which would serve as B-side for McCann's own 1977 Top Ten hit \"Do You Wanna Make Love\", featured a distinct second verse from that eventually recorded by Jennifer Warnes: Warnes herself wrote lyrics for a less overtly masculine second verse which McCann rejected, eventually himself writing new second verse lyrics deemed female-friendly. Prior to the release of Warnes' version of \"Right Time...\", Bette Midler expressed an interest in recording the song but asked that the bridge be reworked, a stipulation McCann was still working on when Warnes' version reached the charts at which point work on a Midler version was dropped. \"Right Time of the Night\" was one of seven songs which McCann played for Clive Davis, president of Arista Records (for whom Jennifer Warnes recorded) when McCann was making the rounds of auditions in hopes of being signed as a recording artist. McCann would recall Davis saying: \"I don't like you as an artist, but I'm taking six of the seven songs.\" \"Right Time...\" was one of the six songs Davis optioned (the one song Davis passed on was \"Do You Wanna Make Love\" which would afford McCann a Top Ten hit when he recorded it after his October 1976 signing with 20th Century Records.)"

        "content": "The inaugural Arista Records single and album releases of Jennifer Warnes: the single \"Right Time of the Night\" and its parent Jennifer Warnes album, were both released in January 1977, over a year and a half subsequent to Warnes' April 1975 signing with Arista. Although the recording of the Jennifer Warnes album had commenced in May 1975, her producer Jim Price would record Warnes only sporadically as his work schedule permitted - (Jennifer Warnes quote:)\"[Price was] producing,...arranging, singing, engineering, playing horns and so forth [for various artists]\" -  and so Arista president Clive Davis was not presented with the completed tracks intended to comprise Warnes' inaugural Arista album until the summer of 1976. Davis' reaction to the intended album for Warnes was (Clive Davis quote): \"It was a good enough album but it didn't have anything on it that could give her the hit single she needs\", and Davis resultantly recruited  Jim Ed Norman to produce two tracks to supplement Price's work, with Norman overseeing Warnes' sessions for the tracks \"Right Time of the Night\" and \"I'm Dreamin\" at Davlen Sound Studios in July 1976. (Jennifer Warnes quote:): \"Clive picked 'I'm Dreaming' and 'Right Time of the Night', and he brought in Jim Ed Norman...to give those songs very explicit tracks\"- Norman, who had been a member of Don Henley's pre-Eagles band Shiloh, having overseen string arrangements for the Eagles' albums Desperado and One of These Nights and also having arranged strings for Linda Ronstadt's version of \"Desperado\" (album Don't Cry Now/ 1973).  (Jennifer Warnes quote:):\"Because of the amount of money Linda Ronstadt was making for Asylum [Records] Arista pretty much saw me as [their] ticket [to similar success].\" Warnes' recordings of \"Right Time of the Night\" and \"I'm Dreaming\" would mark the debut of Jim Ed Norman as a record producer: Norman had been working as a recording studio tape copyist when he was recruited as a producer by Clive Davis on the recommendation of Hank Medress and Dave Appell the producers of Arista star act Tony Orlando & Dawn (Norman had arranged and conducted the strings for the 1976 Group With No Name album Moon Over Brooklyn which was a Medress-Appell production). Upon hearing \"Right Time...\" as one of a number of demos of songs Davis felt had hit potential, Norman would recall telling Davis: \"If you\u2019re going to give me a chance to make a record for you, let it be with that song.\" Davis, who assisted in the vocal arrangement of \"Right Time of the Night\", assigned Val Garay to mix  \"Right Time...\" and \"I'm Dreaming\" and also remix Warnes' Jim Price-produced tracks: Garay had mixed the Linda Ronstadt albums Heart Like a Wheel and Prisoner in Disguise and around the time of his work on the Jennifer Warnes album was working on Ronstadt's album Hasten Down the Wind. The production costs of the Jim Price sessions with Jennifer Warnes had totaled $60,000: the recording of the two supplementary tracks: \"Right Time...\" and \"I'm Dreaming\", plus the expenditure for the Garay remix upped the production costs of the Jennifer Warnes album to a $115,000 total. Warnes' recording of \"Right Time of the Night\" features a lyrically distinct second verse from the original Peter McCann song: Warnes herself wrote lyrics for a less overtly masculine second verse which McCann rejected, eventually himself writing new second verse lyrics deemed female-friendly."

        "content": "After scheduling the  Jennifer Warnes album for August 1976 release, Davis elected to hold back release until the new year, deeming Warnes' album likely to be lost in the holiday season sales boom: both the album and its lead single \"Right Time of the Night\" were resultantly released 1 January 1977. \"Right Time...\" would debut on the 29 January 1977 edition of the Billboard Hot 100 at #81, Warnes' first appearance on the chart in a nine-year recording career: the single would reach a #6 Hot 100 peak that May -  paralleled by a #5 peak in Cash Box. \"Right Time of the Night\" would also become the first Arista release to reach the C&W chart, where it peaked at #17: the single's promotion in Nashville - the hub of C&W music - was handled by the Nashville office of ABC Music Productions who were the publishers of the song. On the Billboard ranking of Easy Listening hits  \"Right Time of the Night\" would reach #1 and would be ranked at #11 on the tally of the year's most successful Easy Listening hits. Ranked at #34 on Billboards listing of the most successful Hot 100 hits of the year 1977,  \"Right Time of the Night\" would be the first of six Hot 100 entries for Jennifer Warnes as a soloist and would remain her most successful solo hit, her one further Top 40 hit \"I Know a Heartache When I See One\" peaking at #19 in 1979. However Warnes was to twice reach #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 as a duo member, first with Joe Cocker on \"Up Where We Belong\" (1982) and then with Bill Medley on \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\" (1987). High Fidelity critic Todd Everett would contrast \"Right Time of the Night\" with the bulk of its parent album: in Everett's estimation the Jim Price-produced tracks evinced the penchant of Warnes' earlier albums \"toward rock & roll as art song\" and were sung by Warnes \"as though [with] fists clenched, both arms straight down at her sides, staring at the microphone\", while \"Right Time...\" \"boasts a much more powerful vocal treatment (when I first heard it on the radio I thought that it was [iconic 60's vocalist] Darlene Love!) that sounds great, but may not be the kind of thing that Warnes wants to be identified with.\" While promoting Famous Blue Raincoat, her career defining 1986 album of Leonard Cohen songs, Warnes was indeed quoted as saying: \"I had an easier time singing [Cohen's] songs than I had singing 'Right Time of the Night'. There's a side to [Cohen's] music that's more complex than what normal pop music will allow;\"\"My heart and soul and mind are more complex than 'It's the right time of the night for making love' - although I'm grateful for [that] pop hit...I had [more profound] things to say\"."

Warnes' duet with Joe Cocker: \"Up Where We Belong\" (on Island Records), was in the UK Top Ten in February 1983 but this apparently failed to afford any prestige to the re-release of \"Right Time...\" as the track again failed to rank in the official UK chart (despite the official chart by that time having expanded to a Top 100)."

He later explained his reasons as \"exhaustion, and a lack of interest in seeing a stage again for a while\". In early August 1978, during rehearsals with a number of drummers including Terry Bozzio, Thin Lizzy had chosen ex-Ian Gillan Band drummer Mark Nauseef to replace Downey. The Sydney concert was Nauseef's penultimate show as a member of Thin Lizzy, as Downey returned to the band in December. The opening acts for the concert were The Sports, Jon English and Wha-Koo, though these acts do not appear on the CD or some of the video releases. Thin Lizzy did a morning sound check which extended to a jam of around 25 minutes for those who had arrived extra early for the concert. The band performed for an estimated crowd of 100,000 on the steps of the famous Sydney Opera House. The large crowd was due to the free entry for the concert."

Raymond eventually obtained a medical degree and became a pathologist at a Delaware hospital. A co-worker at his hospital was an Angel of Death, murdering 27 patients. While Langston saw the evidence, he was never able to put it together. He ultimately wrote a book about the experiences, titled In Front of my Eyes, which was read by not only Gil Grissom but also Archie Johnson and Dr. Tom Loman (of CSI: Miami). Afterward, Langston became a professor at West Las Vegas University, but continued to do pro bono work as a surgeon. It was in this capacity that he came into contact with the CSI team, as they were investigating a series of murders attributed to serial killer Nate Haskell, whom Langston interviewed for the course. After the case's conclusion, Grissom encouraged Langston to join the Las Vegas Crime Lab as a Level 1 investigator."

His first day was troubling for him, as he overdusted a print and ruined it, dropped a burned body and tore its shirt, got his necktie stuck in the victim's blood (causing it to become evidence), and drew Riley Adams's criticism when he reprimanded a man who struck his son. He also received a cold welcome from David Hodges, who was still unhappy about Gil Grissom's departure, but who warms up to Langston after the latter demonstrates a cornmeal bomb. Nevertheless, the team accepts him as one of their own, inviting him to join them at a dinner. The episode ends with Langston staying late and practicing dusting with his own prints. In later episodes, it is revealed that Langston has a number of interests, including blues music, and quickly befriended the like-minded Doc Al Robbins. In \"Deep Fried and Minty Fresh\", it is revealed Langston knows some Mandarin Chinese. He demonstrates a knowledge and skill in the use of firearms.  He is the only member of the team who rides a motorcycle to work. Langston, despite his calm demeanor, occasionally takes cases personally. In his first case, he reprimanded a father for shouting at his son while the team was searching the boy's room, earning a reprimand from Riley about keeping an emotional distance. In \"Mascara\", one of his former students who was planning on joining CSI is killed, and Langston attacks the suspects when he blames it on a god. He was forced to kill a suspect in self-defense in the Season 9 finale, \"All In\"; his lack of guilt over the event worries him. It was the first time he had taken a life in the line of duty. In episode \"No Way Out\", he and fellow CSI Riley Adams are held hostage in the aftermath of a shootout in a quiet Las Vegas neighborhood in which Riley was able to disarm the suspect. By the Season 10 premiere episode, Langston has taken numerous courses (going so far as to max out the hours the lab will pay for and paying out of his own pocket) and has since been promoted to CSI Level 2, as well as to being cleared of suspicion from the events of \"All In\". As seen in \"Sin City Blue\", he refused to give his DNA to the Crime Lab to clear himself from the investigation; the reason why is later speculated on by Wendy Simms and David Hodges in \"Doctor Who\", though the two draw no concrete conclusions. In the episode \"All That Cremains\", it is revealed that he was once married to a woman named Gloria; yet it is known from the CSI: NY Season 6 episode \"Hammer Down\", he had no children with her. She arrives at the Crime Lab to tell Ray she is getting married and invites him to the wedding. She asks Ray to come to dinner where he will meet her future husband. He said that he would think about it, but he does arrive at dinner to meet them. At the end of the episode, he gets dressed up and Nick Stokes notices that he is still wearing his wedding ring. Nick suggests that Ray not wear it at the wedding. After Nick leaves, Ray takes his ring off, puts it in his locker, and leaves for the wedding."

        "title": "Raymond Langston_Trouble with Nate Haskell",
        "content": "Serial killer Nate Haskell first appears in the Season 9 episode \"19 Down\", the first part of the final episode of Gil Grissom, the former supervisor of the crime lab. Langston was a professor of forensics and taught a class in college. Grissom comes to one of his classes, which is when Haskell is mentioned. After Langston became a CSI following Grissom's retirement, Haskell emerges again when he calls Langston in the first part of the Season 10 finale \"Doctor Who.\" At the conclusion of Season 10 (\"Meat Jekyll\"), Langston is stabbed by Haskell in the closing minutes of the second part of the finale and collapses to the ground, bleeding. In the eleventh-season premiere, Ray survives the attack but has lost one of his kidneys as a result and regularly needs a cane to help him although in later episodes, he seems to be fully capable of walking without it. Later in the episode \"Bump and Grind\", Langston receives a letter from Haskell, where he finds a kidney bean and note that says, \"Just thinking about you, XO, Nate\". In the end of the episode, he looks at the scars that Haskell gave him and Sara Sidle walks in. He tells her about the letter that Haskell sent him, and Sara tells him to not let Haskell get in his head. Later in the episode \"Targets of Obsession\", Langston goes to court to testify against Haskell. During the trial, Haskell contends that he is a victim of his own circumstances. As a child, he was abused by his alcoholic father, and he is also a carrier of the MAO-A gene, which has been shown to predispose an individual to violent behavior. When Langston takes the stand, Haskell forces him to recount in full detail the attack at the crime lab. At first, it appears that the jury has been swayed by Haskell's testimony; however, near the close of the case, Langston returns to the stand to rebuke Haskell's MAO-A defense. When Haskell questions Langston's ability to testify on the matter, Langston reveals that he is personally equipped to discuss the influence of the MAO-A gene on a person's behavior. Like Haskell, Langston reveals, he too was abused by an alcoholic father and has the MAO-A gene. The fact that Langston has avoided becoming a criminal himself and instead takes pleasure in seeing criminals being brought to justice proves for the court that neither abuse nor the MAO-A gene can determine a person's behavior, and Haskell is found guilty. Haskell sends a signal to his fianc\u00e9e, which Langston notices while the verdict was being read. As Langston was leaving to go home after his success in court, he sees the group of women that tried to free Haskell through his defenses and becomes suspicious when he doesn't see Haskell's fianc\u00e9e nor a certain other woman. He remembers the signal sent and quickly returns to the prison where Haskell was being held, and finds that there was another inmate wearing Nate Haskell's prison band. It is later shown that Haskell's fianc\u00e9e helped him escape by killing the other inmates, the other prison guards, and the woman that helped her. In the episode \"Unleashed\", Ray reveals to Lady Heather, that when he was applying for medical school, he was asked why he wanted to be a doctor. He responded with as long as he was helping people, he was not hurting them. Lady Heather remarks that his ugly side will be the one to catch Haskell. Ray replies that his ugly side won't catch Haskell, but instead kill him. In the episode \"Father of the Bride\", Ray and the team receive a video of Haskell. It showed his fianc\u00e9e, Vivian, who helped him escape, and it appeared to be a ransom video. In the Season 11 finale, Langston snaps after Haskell kidnaps Ray's ex-wife Gloria and hints that he (Haskell) sexually assaulted her. While rescuing Gloria, Langston defeats Haskell in a fight and then beats him multiple times, using his medical knowledge to inflict as much damage as possible to Haskell. He damages Haskell's kidney in retaliation, and breaks his knee. After a series of beatings, Ray throws Haskell over a railing killing him. Captain Jim Brass is the first officer to arrive at the crime scene.  After seeing what Haskell did to Gloria, Captain Brass writes up Haskell's death as justifiable homicide by Ray in defense of Gloria's and his own life.  Brass then ensures that the evidence at the crime scene supports his report.   Catherine sends in the report to Internal Affairs saying the evidence supports that he acted in self-defense. At the end of the episode, Internal Affairs interviews him, and asks if he killed Haskell in self-defense or murdered him. The episode abruptly ends. In the Season 12 premiere, \"73 Seconds\", Brass and Doc Robbins mention that Ray is back in Baltimore with Gloria, and Doc Robbins tells Brass that killing Haskell was probably the best thing for Ray, as it saved his life. Though Ray was not formally charged by IA, he was pressured into resigning from the team, and almost all of the CSIs involved were affected in some way; Catherine Willows and Nick Stokes were stripped of their positions of graveyard shift supervisor and assistant supervisor, respectively, because of the team's attempt to shield Ray and for not bringing Ray into line during his attempt to find Haskell."

My father had invented a very fast and effective communication system for me when I was losing my voice. It is a sign language that requires only eye movements and is faster than any computer. I would try to explain to my caregiver (usually my dad, mom, or my close friends) what to play on the keyboard. When they got fairly close, I would have them take me into LogicPro where I could edit every part of every note. After composing in this way I got together with my friend and co-producer, Dan Alvarez. We worked on arrangements and sounds to make it better. Then we got musician friends to add their talents to the mix.\" In addition to 13 tracks, the disc also includes bonus features that are playable on a computer.

Further, her hands-on approach in accompanying the detectives is at odds with Detective Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni), who does not believe he is able to do his job with Greylek looking over his shoulder. In the episode \"Babes\", Greylek angers a woman believed to be involved with a young girl's suicide, but she was found not guilty. After gloating about her innocence, the woman physically attacks Greylek in the courtroom for correcting her about being \"innocent\" and to wash the blood off her hands before holding her daughter's baby. When the officers pull the woman off her, Greylek tells Stabler to charge her with assault. However, Greylek has shown a softer side; warning Stabler to get a good defense attorney for his daughter Kathleen (Allison Siko), in the episode \"Swing\". Kathleen, who has bipolar disorder, is charged with breaking & entering in conjunction with theft, and the DA's office will prosecute her. In the episode \"Smut\", Greylek successfully prosecutes serial rapist Eric Lutz (Michael Trucco), who claims that his actions were caused by violent pornography; Graylek tracks down Lutz's former fianc\u00e9e, whom he also raped, and gets her to testify that Lutz does not use pornography and is simply violent by nature. Greylek also seeks justice when a man is brutally beaten outside a strip club, with the man's ex-wife and 13-year-old transgender daughter Hailey (Bridger Zadina) as the prime suspects, in the episode \"Transitions\". Before the case gets to trial, detectives Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler discover that it was Haley's guidance counselor who committed the crime. During the trial, Greylek uncovers that the guidance counselor is also a transgender woman and that is why she tried to help Haley. The character is written out in episode \"Lead\", during the middle of a trial where pediatrician Gilbert Keppler (Lawrence Arancio) is found guilty of molesting his patients. Greylek is last seen doing a press conference with Captain Don Cragen (Dann Florek), Benson, and Stabler on the steps of the courthouse. When the doctor's attorney hands the SVU squad a lawsuit, Greylek responds, \"What did you people do?\". Later in the episode, Benson and Stabler discover the doctor murdered in his home. The detectives hold CSU out of the house until Cragen and Greylek get to the scene in case IAB wants to \"screw with\" them again. Sergeant John Munch (Richard Belzer) asks if they are sure Greylek isn't on one of her I need to be at the crime scene' crusades again\", when Detective Fin Tutuola (Ice-T) realises \"It's not Greylek\" and they all see ADA Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) walk up to the scene with Cragen. Cabot tells the detectives that the Justice Department called Greylek back to D.C. and that District Attorney Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) let her leave immediately."

On the casting, creator and executive producer of SVU Dick Wolf claimed, \"We look forward to [McManus] working with Neal [Baer], Ted [Kotcheff] and me to create another interesting and memorable character in the Law & Order universe\".

In the series, Greylek departs to D.C. in the fifteenth episode \"Lead\" and is replaced by Cabot (March) in a recurring capacity (while McManus continued to appear in the opening credits for the rest of the season).

Despite Nelson's fruitless efforts to succeed with his recording releases with D Records, and after trying with other labels as a singer, he sold several of his original written songs to other artists. After his composition \"Family Bible\" became a hit for Claude Gray in 1960, he moved to Nashville, where he was signed by Pamper Music as a songwriter. Several of his songs became hits for other artists, including Faron Young (\"Hello Walls\"); Ray Price (\"Night Life\") and Patsy Cline (\"Crazy\"). Fueled by the success of his songwriting, he was signed by Liberty Records. During August, Nelson  started recording his first album, produced by Joe Allison. The single releases of the album \"Touch Me\" and \"The Part Where I Cry\" were recorded on that day in Nashville, Tennessee, while it was completed during September in the recording facilities of the label in Los Angeles, California. The single \"Touch Me\" became Nelson's second top ten, reaching number 7 on Billboard's Hot Country Singles."

        "content": "In 1958, Nelson released two records under a contract with Pappy Daily of D Records, \"Man With the Blues\"/\"The Storm Has Just Begun\" and \"What a Way to Live\"/\"Misery Mansion\". While working for D Records and singing in nightclubs, Nelson was hired by guitar instructor Paul Buskirk to teach in his school. He sold to Buskirk his original songs \"Family Bible\" for US$50, and \"Night Life\" for US$150. \"Family Bible\" turned into a hit for Claude Gray in 1960. Nelson moved to Nashville in 1960, but no label signed him. Most of his demos were rejected. Nelson was later signed as a songwriter to Pamper Music with the help of Hank Cochran, who worked for the publishing company owned by Ray Price and Hal Smith. Faron Young recorded Nelson's \"Hello Walls\", and after Ray Price recorded Nelson's \"Night Life\", and his previous bassist Johnny Paycheck quit, Nelson joined Price's touring band as a bass player. While playing with Price and the Cherokee Cowboys, other of his original songs became hits for other artists, including \"Funny How Time Slips Away\" (Billy Walker), \"Pretty Paper\" (Roy Orbison), and, most famously, \"Crazy\" by Patsy Cline. Nelson signed with Liberty Records and was recording by August 1961 at Quonset Hut Studio.  As Nelson later recalled, Cochran was instrumental in getting him signed: \"Hank had convinced Liberty's A&R man for country music, Joe Allison, that I was the next big thing...Allison knew that there wasn't any way I was gonna change my singing style - and that was fine by him.  He understood me.  He just wanted me to sing my own songs in my own way.\""

        "content": "In his 2015 autobiography, Nelson insists that he composed \"Crazy\", \"Night Life\", \"Funny How Time Slips Away\", \"Mr. Record Man\", \"I Gotta Get Drunk\" and \"The Party's Over\" in one songwriting jag while living in Houston before finally moving to Nashville: \"Within an astounding short period of time \u2013 a week or two \u2013 I'd written a suite of songs that reflected my real-life situation.  I knew these songs were damn good, but at the same time, I didn't know what to do with them.\"  Nelson unconsciously borrowed the first few notes of \"Crazy\" from the Floyd Tillman song \"I Gotta Have My Baby Back.\"   \"Hello Walls\" was written after Nelson had been hired by Pamper Music.  Initially collaborating with Hank Cochran, he was nervous at first, realizing \"this was creativity on demand,\" and later recalling: First few days found me a little uneasy.  I had my guitar, a pencil, and a blank notebook.  Hank might throw out an idea, hoping it might spark something in me.  When that didn't work, he might tell me a joke, or I might tell him one, hoping that joking would lead to some kind of song.  It didn't...And one afternoon, after we had just sat around throwing the bull, he said, \"I'm going to the office to make a few calls.  You work on something by yourself.\" By the time Cochran had returned from his phone call Nelson had written \"Hello Walls\" and sang it for him.  \"It's worth a fuckin' fortune,\" Cochran responded, adding, \"Willie, my friend, you just wrote a hit.\" The recording sessions for his first album release, ...And Then I Wrote, began in the Nashville studios of Liberty Records. Nelson recorded on August 22\u201323, starting during the night and lasting until the morning of the following day. Dissatisfied with the results, Allison moved the sessions to the studios of the label in Los Angeles, California, where Nelson was joined by three other stellar guitarists - session leader Billy Strange, Roy Nichols from the Maddox Brothers and Rose, and Johnny Western, who had worked with Johnny Cash. During two sessions on September 11\u201312, Nelson recorded \"Crazy\", \"Darkness on the Face of the Earth\", \"Three Days\", \"Funny How Times Slips Away\", \"Mr. Record Man\" and \"Hello Walls\". B. J. Baker led the vocal chorus that attempted to back Nelson, but the singer's idiosyncratic style gave them problems, as recounted by Nelson biographer Joe Nick Patoski: \"The singers got lost trying to follow Willie's lead vocals until Joe Allison put up some baffles between Willie and the singers so they couldn't hear one another.  To stay on the beat, the singers followed Johnny Western's direction.\"  The liner notes of the album were written by local DJ Charlie Williams, by request of Allison.  The album's biggest hit was \"Touch Me,\" a sad blues done in a slow drag with the rough edges smoothed out by harmony singers and a cool instrumental arrangement that reached the Top 10 and earned Nelson a place on jukeboxes throughput the United States. It was during the recording of \"Mr. Record Man\" that Nelson met his second wife Shirley Collie, with whom he would soon record the duet \"Willingly\", a Cochran composition."

We put him on records when we was at the top of the game. He didn't even have a car. We gave him respect on the strength of Jam Master Jay. What did we get in return?

Townsend has compared the album's songwriting to his more accessible songs, such as \"Life\" from Ocean Machine: Biomech (1997), \"Stagnant\" from Terria (2001), and \"Material\" from Physicist (2000). The album's production style was directly influenced by Nickelback's 2008 album Dark Horse. Townsend has quipped that \"Some parts of it sound like Meshuggah, some parts of it sound like Boney M.\" Addicted includes a new version of the song \"Hyperdrive\" from Townsend's album Ziltoid the Omniscient (2007), with lead vocals by van Giersbergen, who has performed a cover of the song with her former band Agua de Annique. \"Resolve!\" was \"directly influenced by The Wildhearts\" and it bears a resemblance to \"Vanilla Radio\" from The Wildhearts Must Be Destroyed. Unlike Townsend's previous albums, which were usually in open C tuning, most of the songs on Addicted were played in open B tuning. \"Universe in a Ball!\" was played in open B, \"Hyperdrive!\" in open C (to accommodate the vocal range of van Giersbergen, as opposed to the version of \"Hyperdrive\" that appeared on the album Ziltoid the Omniscient which was recorded in C), and \"Ih-Ah!\" and \"The Way Home!\" in open C."

When we recorded it, it seemed only natural to bring in the guys from New Grass Revival \u2013 Pat Flynn, Bela Fleck, John Cowan, and Sam Bush, teamed with Jerry Douglas.  This was the first time the New Grass Revival had been together since their breakup over a year prior to the recording of this song.

This is the third of the small handful of pre-psychedelic era songs the group recorded that had more than two members singing lead at one point; the previous were \"Isn't She Pretty\" and \"Check Yourself\". As with \"Isn't She Pretty\", Paul Williams is the song's main lead, yet the song mainly showcases another group member, in this case Eddie Kendricks, who alternates between his famous falsetto and his natural register (first and second tenor). Bryant's voice is also prominently heard here, delivering harmony solos behind Kendricks' and Williams' leads as well as having brief lead lines on the first two choruses (\"To me\" and \"I'm going cry\"). Bass singer Melvin Franklin starts the song with do-wop harmonies and later repeats Williams' line, \"Why couldn\u2019t you be true?\" at the end of the second verse. Although it did not chart nationally, the song was a regional smash hit in the country's mid-west. This would be the group's final A-side released with Williams as the main lead (although B-side releases \"Just Let Me Know\", \"Baby, Baby I Need You\", and \"Don't Look Back\" would be promoted as if they were), and the final one to feature Bryant's vocals altogether (his voice however would appear on two later B-sides). The next three singles from the group would have Kendricks on lead, and then, beginning with \"My Girl\", David Ruffin, Bryant's replacement, would become the Temptations' new main lead singer."

Backing him are fellow members Otis Williams, Paul Williams and Melvin Franklin; Bryant's vocals do not actually appear on this track.

Two of Germany's founding rap groups, Die Fantastischen Vier and Advanced Chemistry swallowed up the hip hop craze when movies such as Wild Style and Beat Street dropped in the early 1980s.  When the fad died down, the elements of the movement\u2014questioning externally attributed identities and dealing with positions of disfranchisement in society\u2014resonated with German youth.  So much so that when groups started emulating American hip hop in search of their own, local sound, the clique \"rap\" indicators like screaming \"hey yo\" over a chorus were soon dismissed as mindless.  It wasn't until this stage in the movement in Germany, that performers like Azad could arise, respectively embodying the confidence, presence, and seamlessness so reminiscent of American rappers like Notorious B.I.G. and Snoop Dogg."

        "content": "Allmusic's Jared Johnson said \"in the post-Katy Perry world, it would be tough to find a more relevant, fresh, and thoughtful album than Britt Nicole's Lost Get Found. Following a well-received debut, the Christian singer's sophomore record finds her at her peak: infectious, vivid, and great on the dancefloor. Nicole channels the energy of many of her contemporaries, from Sara Bareilles to Avril Lavigne, Ashley Tisdale to Gwen Stefani.\" Johnson wrote \"thankfully, the album does not sacrifice substance for style; Nicole once again shows her strength of delivering meaningful lyrics relating to specific events and situations. Producers Robert Marvin (Mat Kearney, tobyMac) and Dan Muckala (Brandon Heath, Backstreet Boys) collaborated to give the album its high-energy output.\"CCM Magazines Andrew Greer said \"oscillating between vulnerable tracks that vocalize the struggle to surrender to God and sunny tunes of sheer fun, The Lost Get Found is an attractive set list. And though the lyrics may be a bit vague at times, this is pop music, and excellent pop music at that.\" Christian Music Review's Kevin Davis said \"'The Lost Get Found' is a great and catchy album by Britt Nicole. The title track, 'Safe', 'Hanging On', 'Headphones', 'Walk on The Water' and 'Have Your Way' are my favorite songs on the album. Along with 'Life Light Up' by Christy Nockels this is my top album by a female artist and one of my top overall albums of the year. If you liked 'Relentless' by Natalie Grant and 'My Paper Heart' by Francesca Battistelli, then you\u2019ll love 'The Lost Get Found' by Britt Nicole.\" Cross Rhythms' Simon Eden said \"this is pop nearing perfection. Remarkably, every track on this, Britt's second album, has the potential to become a US/UK mainstream number one hit with sufficient airplay. That success is beginning to show with the album and the title track single both hitting number one on the US Christian charts. With slightly breathy, sultry, intimate verses balanced with powerful choruses, each song radiates such positivity that you wonder how they managed to get the rainbows and sunshine packaged in.\" Eden wrote \"Musically targeted at excitable teenage girls, the Christian aspect is brilliantly natural and portrays God as a normal integrated part of any teenager's life without dumbing down or hyped worship and is a major credit to Britt's songwriting. As a pop album it fits into a mainstream genre and consequently sounds similar to singers like Avril Lavigne, which is no bad thing.\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Nathaniel Schexnayder wrote that \"despite some clich\u00e9 lyrics and the absence of more straight-up terrific highlights, The Lost Get Found is a fun album which definitely is a solid follow up to Say It. But even though the pop dance tunes are catchy, Meyers and many other pop-flair dependent artists routinely produce similar ear candy. The blend of youth and a refined pop beat combined on the title track is likely the direction where Britt Nicole should go in order to stand-out more. After all, that's how the good get better.\" Louder Than the Music's Suzanne Physick said \"Every once in a while you find a track that perfectly sums up something you have been trying to say for ages but have never managed to find the words. For me, Have Your Way is that track. It is the perfect pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Simply with that and the wonderfully written Headphones the album would be worth buying but the truth [is] that there are 9 other fantastic tracks that come along with them and you really shouldn't miss out on any one of them.\""

In the 2013 film Star Trek Into Darkness, he is portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch. Khan had controlled more than a quarter of the Earth during the Eugenics Wars of the 1990s. After being revived from suspended animation in 2267 by the crew of the Starship Enterprise, Khan attempts to capture the starship, but is thwarted by James T. Kirk and exiled on Ceti Alpha V to create a new society with his people. In Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, set fifteen years after \"Space Seed\", Khan escapes his exile and sets out to exact revenge upon Kirk. In Star Trek Into Darkness, set in the alternate continuity established in Star Trek (2009), Khan is awakened almost a decade before the events of \"Space Seed\". Khan is given the false identity John Harrison and coerced by Admiral Marcus into building weapons for Section 31 and Starfleet in exchange for the lives of Khan's crew. He ultimately rebels and comes into conflict with the crew of Enterprise."

        "content": "Khan makes his introductory appearance as the antagonist in the episode \"Space Seed\", first broadcast on February 16, 1967. According to the backstory revealed in the episode, Khan is one of a group of genetically engineered superhumans, bred to be free of the usual human mental and physical limitations, who were removed from power after the Eugenics Wars of the 1990s. Khan had been both the most successful conqueror and the most benign ruler of the group, ruling more than a quarter of the Earth's area across Asia to the Middle East from 1992 to 1996 with a firm but generally peaceful hand until he was deposed. While most of the supermen were killed or sentenced to death, Khan and 84 others escaped Earth by way of the sleeper ship SS  Botany Bay. Botany Bay is discovered by the crew of the Starship Enterprise in 2267, with Khan and 72 of the 84 crew members of Botany Bay still alive, cryogenically frozen in suspended animation. When Khan's sleep chamber malfunctions, he is transported to Enterprise, where he reawakens and learns he is in the 23rd century. Given spacious quarters while Botany Bay is towed to a starbase, Khan fascinates and charms the ship's historian, Marla McGivers (Madlyn Rhue), while using his access to the ship's technical manuals to learn how to take over and operate Enterprise. McGivers agrees to help Khan revive the other supermen, allowing him to organize an attempted takeover. To coerce the Enterprise crew to cooperate with him, Khan places Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) in the ship's decompression chamber and threatens to kill Kirk unless the crew submits. McGivers cannot stand by as her Captain dies and frees Kirk, who neutralizes Khan's men by using a neural gas. Khan heads to engineering and sets the ship's engines to self-destruct, whereupon he is incapacitated by Kirk. Captain Kirk conducts a hearing, sentencing Khan and his followers to exile on an uncolonized world, Ceti Alpha V. Khan accepts Kirk's challenge\u2014invoking the fall of Lucifer in Milton's Paradise Lost<ref>[http://www.chakoteya.net/StarTrek/24.htm Space Seed\"] (script)</ref>\u2014and McGivers joins Khan rather than face court-martial.

Captain Clark Terrell (Paul Winfield) and First Officer Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) of USS Reliant are searching for an uninhabited world to test the Genesis device, a powerful terraforming tool. They beam down to what they believe is Ceti Alpha VI. Khan and his people capture them, and Khan explains that the barren world is in fact Ceti Alpha V; Ceti Alpha VI exploded months after he and his people had been marooned. The cataclysm rendered Ceti Alpha V nigh-uninhabitable. Twenty of the survivors, including McGivers, whom Khan had married, were subsequently killed by the only surviving animal life, the Ceti eel. Swearing vengeance on Kirk, now an admiral, for abandoning them to die, Khan infests Terrell and Chekov with young Ceti eels; the creatures enter their brains, rendering them vulnerable to suggestion. Khan then seizes control of Reliant, intent on capturing the Genesis device. Khan lures Enterprise to the space station Regula I, and he launches a surprise attack that disables Kirk's ship. Kirk tricks Khan by using a special code to remotely lower Reliants shields, allowing Enterprise to inflict significant damage. Khan is forced to withdraw to make repairs. Using the mind-controlled Terrell and Chekov as spies, Khan captures the Genesis device and leaves Kirk marooned on Regula I. Spock deceives Khan into thinking that Enterprise is crippled, surprising Khan when Enterprise rescues Kirk and escapes to the nearby Mutara Nebula. Goaded into following Kirk, Khan pilots Reliant into the nebula, where shields and sensors are inoperable. Due to Khan's inexperience with three-dimensional space combat, Enterprise defeats Reliant and Khan is fatally wounded. Refusing to accept defeat, Khan activates the Genesis device, intent on killing his foe along with himself. Khan quotes Ahab's words of vengeance from Moby-Dick before dying."

While the character's backstory remains the same, Khan is revived by Starfleet Admiral Alexander Marcus rather than the crew of Enterprise. Marcus anticipates a war with the Klingons, and forces Khan to develop warships and weapons for Starfleet under the cover identity of John Harrison, holding Khan's shipmates hostage. These developments include advanced long-range torpedoes and the warship USS Vengeance. Khan carries out an attack on a high level Starfleet meeting where Admiral Christopher Pike is killed before fleeing to the Klingon homeworld Qo'noS. Marcus arms the Enterprise with 72 advanced torpedoes and sends Kirk and crew to Qo'noS with orders to kill Khan. Kirk goes against his orders and attempts to capture him alive. Upon learning the number of torpedoes on board Enterprise, Khan surrenders, revealing his identity, the presence of his followers inside the torpedoes, and the reasons for his attacks. When Marcus arrives aboard Vengeance and attacks Enterprise, Kirk and Khan work together to take control of Vengeances bridge. Once in control of Vengeance, Khan kills Marcus and demands that Spock return his crew. Spock, having removed Khan's people from the torpedoes, lowers Enterprise's shields and allows Khan to beam the activated weapons' warheads aboard Vengeance. Before Khan can attack Enterprise Spock remotely detonates the torpedoes crippling Vengeance. Khan crashes Vengeance in San Francisco in an attempt to destroy Starfleet Headquarters and escape, but is pursued and captured by Spock and Uhura. Khan is placed back into cryogenic sleep along with his crew."

        "content": "Khan has been depicted in various novels and comic book publications. As with all non-television and non-film Star Trek material, the publications are outside of Star Trek canon. Author Greg Cox penned three Star Trek novels featuring Khan, published by licensee Pocket Books. In the two-volume The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh, Khan is depicted as a North Indian from a family of Sikhs. \"Khan\" is a title; his adoptive parents are from Chandigarh, Punjab, India and are both eugenic scientists. At the end of the second novel, Khan and his followers are placed aboard the Botany Bay by Gary Seven as part of a deal to stop Khan's machinations on Earth. The 2005 follow-up, To Reign in Hell: The Exile of Khan Noonien Singh, relates what happened to Khan and his fellow exiles between the events of \"Space Seed\" and The Wrath of Khan. A different version of Khan's exile on Ceti Alpha V is depicted in IDW Publishing's 2010 comic miniseries Khan: Ruling in Hell. From 2013 to 2014, IDW published a five-part series of comic books telling the story of the Into Darkness incarnation of Khan. The first issue in the series acknowledges the discrepancy of Khan's physical appearance compared to that of the previous incarnation. In keeping with the prime timeline's backstory, Khan's beginnings, rise to power, and involvement in the Eugenics War are depicted. It is also revealed his birth name was Noonien Singh and that he adopted the title \"Khan\" out of admiration for Genghis Khan. The series goes on to mention that Khan's anatomy and memories were altered per Marcus's orders, so that Khan would initially believe himself to be the fabricated Harrison."

        "content": "Writer Carey Wilber pitched \"Space Seed\" to Star Trek producers Roddenberry, Gene Coon, and Robert Justman with an 18-page outline dated August 29, 1966. In the outline, Wilber envisioned the crew of Botany Bay as criminals sent on a 1,500-year journey to make room on Earth for others. Khan was represented as a Nordic criminal with a \"magnificent\" body, Harald Ericsson. The producers suggested changes to the outline in a series of memos; in memos dated September 7 and 9, Coon suggested significant changes to Ericsson. \"I want to rather do more with him than you have indicated in the story outline,\" he wrote. Believing that Ericsson (misspelled as Erickson in the memo) could be a worthy adversary for Kirk, Coon suggested that the character be \"in fact very similar to James Kirk, our captain, except that our captain has made an adjustment to this world and this culture [...] In other words, Carey, build us a giant of a man.\" The first draft of the script introduced the character as John Ericssen\u2014who is revealed to be a man involved in \"The First World Tyranny\", named Ragnar Thorwald. The character of Thorwald was more brutal than Khan in the final version, killing guards using a phaser. In the original script, Kirk forgives Ericssen and offers him and his people a chance at a fresh start\u2014something that remained in the final episode\u2014but the character committing murder would have precluded such an ending, as NBC censors would have necessitated the \"bad guy\" be punished for his actions. By the final draft, Khan is Indian; a character guesses that Khan is from Northern India, and \"probably a Sikh\". Khan's full name was based on that of Kim Noonien Singh, a pilot Gene Roddenberry served with during the Second World War. Roddenberry lost touch with his friend and had hoped that Singh's similar name might attract his attention and renew his old acquaintance. In \"Space Seed\", Khan is presented as having several positive characteristics: he is gracious, smiling, fearless and generous. He is not threatened by the success of others, and encourages their self-esteem. He is also ambitious, desiring a challenge commensurate with his abilities, but this ambition is not tempered by any consideration of the rights of others. Author Paul Cantor asserts that Khan is a mirror image of Kirk, sharing his aggressiveness, ambition, and even his womanizing tendencies, but possessing them in far greater degree. During the episode, several of the characters express their admiration for the man even as they oppose him, with Kirk referring to him as \"the best of the tyrants, and the most dangerous.\" The character's Spanish accent and superhuman appearance strongly differentiate him from most Star Trek characters."

        "content": "After the disappointing response to the first Star Trek feature film, The Motion Picture's plot and direction, Paramount executives appointed Harve Bennett, a television producer who had never watched Star Trek, to be executive producer for the sequel. Bennett watched all the original series episodes and chose Khan from \"Space Seed\" as a possible villain for the film. Early drafts of the script had Khan as a shadowy tyrant leading a planet in revolt; later drafts added the \"Genesis device\" which Khan would steal. Costume designer Robert Fletcher wanted to emphasize the effects of their harsh environment on Khan and his followers. \"My intention with Khan was to express the fact that they had been marooned on that planet with no technical infrastructure, so they had to cannibalize from the spaceship whatever they used or wore. Therefore, I tried to make it look as if they had dressed themselves out of pieces of upholstery and electrical equipment that composed the ship,\" he said. Director Nicholas Meyer told Montalb\u00e1n to keep Khan's right glove on at all times, in order to give viewers a puzzle they could form their own opinions about and add mystery to the character. Meyer has been repeatedly asked if Montalb\u00e1n wore a prosthetic chest for his scenes, as his uniform was purposefully designed with an open front. Meyer replied in audio commentary for the film that Montalb\u00e1n (who was 61 during filming) is \"one strong cookie,\" and that no prosthetics were applied to the actor's sizeable frame. At no point during The Wrath of Khan are Khan and Kirk in the same location; they speak to each other only over communication links such as view screens. This was due in part to the fact that the set of the Reliant was a redress of the Enterprise bridge, and the two actors' scenes were filmed four months apart. Montalb\u00e1n recited his lines with a script assistant instead of to William Shatner. Montalb\u00e1n said in promotional interviews for the film he realized early on in his career that a good villain does not see himself as villainous. The villain may do villainous things, but he feels that he is doing them for righteous reasons. Montalb\u00e1n further stated he always tried to find a flaw in the character, as no one is completely good or completely evil; while Khan had a rather distorted view of reality and therefore performed acts of evil, he still felt that his vengeance was a noble cause because of the death of his wife. Khan quotes the character of Ahab from Moby-Dick throughout the film, driving home his lust to make Kirk pay for the wrongs he has inflicted upon him."

Abrams' Star Trek reboot and the announcement that actors Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto had tentatively agreed to appear in two sequels, Internet rumors began circulating about the plot of the second film. Abrams hinted that because of the alternate timeline created in the first film, reintroducing Khan into Star Trek lore remained a possibility. Abrams told MTV, \"[Khan and Kirk] exist\u2014and while their history may not be exactly as people are familiar with, I would argue that a person's character is what it is,\" Abrams said of the notion that his Khan could be just as evil, even if Kirk never stranded him on Ceti Alpha V. \"Certain people are destined to cross paths and come together, and Khan is out there... even if he doesn't have the same issues.\" Writer Damon Lindelof declared that Khan's \"intense gravity,\" particularly regarding the character's delivery of monologues, made him an obligatory character to use, even if its iconic status made the crew afraid of the fan reaction. Lindelof jokingly stated that \"it was never really a 'Should we or shouldn't we?' as much as it was 'We really have to do this but if we don't get it right people are going to kill us.'\" As part of the secrecy campaign, Benedict Cumberbatch denied that he was playing Khan during interviews, describing Harrison as simply a terrorist with his own purposes, as well as \"someone that's activated and manufactured in a way by Starfleet, and it's a scene that has come back to haunt him.\" He discussed the character's moral ambiguity saying it fit the adage \"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter,\" adding parallels to the current world order \"whether it's U.S. foreign policy or the actions of some terrorists\". Into Darkness writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman added that they used the character of Khan not just for his popularity with the fandom\u2014\"It's so easy to fall into the trap of doing something because you think people are going to love it. You must come up with what the movie can be on its own and then, if it turns out the villain maybe can be Khan, then you can do it. But you can't start there.\"\u2014but for fitting the sequel's theme of \"how far will we go to exact vengeance and justice on an enemy that scares us.\" Some protested Cumberbatch's casting as Khan, believing that a person of Indian descent should have been given the role instead."

Professor William J. Devlin and coauthor Shai Biderman examined Khan's character compared to the \u00dcbermensch and found that Khan's blind pursuit of revenge is against Nietzsche's ideals of transcendence and self-creation of a meaningful life. Instead, the authors offer Spock's self-sacrifice in The Wrath of Khan as a better example of the \u00dcbermensch."

Discussing the Star Trek motion pictures, the Associated Press noted that Star Trek films were measured by how menacing their foe was, and that Khan was among the best in the series; a 2002 review of the Star Trek films ranked Khan as the greatest enemy seen in any of the films. Reviewers of The Wrath of Khan, such as Roger Ebert, rated Khan as one of the strongest aspects of the film. New Yorker critic Pauline Kael said Montalb\u00e1n's performance \"was the only validation he has ever had of his power to command the big screen.\" Critic Christopher Null notes that \"it is nearly gospel now among Trekkies that... Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is the undisputed best of the series, and will likely never meet its equal,\" and calls Khan the \"greatest role of [Montalb\u00e1n's] career\". Though he felt that the villain of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, V'Ger, was more cerebral and interesting, author James Iaccino notes that most fans and moviegoers preferred the archetypical good-versus-evil fight that the struggle between Khan and Kirk represents. Villains in subsequent Star Trek films have been measured by the standard of Khan, with Paramount promising fans that the villain of Star Trek Generations would be equal to the genetic superman. IGN ranked Khan as the best Star Trek villain, noting that he set the pattern for revenge-seeking villains in the series; in the decades since the film's release, \"even those with a passing interest [in Trek] know the name.\"Star Trek producer Rick Berman called the villain \"threatening and memorable.\" Khan is also recognized as a great villain outside of the Star Trek series. The Associated Press called the character \"one of sci-fi's great villains\". In 2002, the Online Film Critics Society's 132 members voted Khan as the 10th-greatest screen villain of all time, the only Star Trek character to appear in the listing. In 2006, Emmy Magazine voted Khan \"TV's Most Out-of-This-World Character\", beating out other science fiction characters such as the Doctor and Commander Adama. Editors wrote that \"Khan was so cool we would've bought a Chrysler Cordoba if he'd told us to,\" alluding to an ad campaign Montalb\u00e1n appeared in for Chrysler. The character also had a cultural impact outside of Star Trek fandom; a clip from The Wrath of Khan featuring Kirk screaming \"Khaaan!\" was one popular culture appropriation that became a \"popular fad\" driving the success of the website YTMND. In 2004, the Star Trek franchise returned to Khan's backstory in a three-episode story arc on Star Trek: Enterprise. In \"Borderland\", \"Cold Station 12\" and \"The Augments\", a 22nd-century scientist is portrayed as having revived genetically engineered embryos from Khan's time and raised them as \"Augments\". Enterprise producer Manny Coto described these characters as \"mini Khan Noonien Singhs\". Benedict Cumberbatch's performance in Star Trek Into Darkness drew praise from critics with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine calling it a \"tour-de-force to be reckoned with\" and his character \"a villain for the ages\". Joe Neumaier of New York's Daily News wrote that Cumberbatch delivered \"one of the best blockbuster villains in recent memory\". Jonathan Romney of The Independent specifically noted Cumberbatch's voice saying it was \"So sepulchrally resonant that it could have been synthesised from the combined timbres of Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and Alan Rickman holding an elocution contest down a well.\" The New York Times praised his screen presence saying \"He fuses Byronic charisma with an impatient, imperious intelligence that seems to raise the ambient I.Q. whenever he's on screen.\" Christian Blauvelt from website Hollywood.com criticized the casting of Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness as being \"whitewashed into oblivion\". Star Trek: Voyager actor Garrett Wang tweeting, \"The casting of Cumberbatch was a mistake on the part of the producers. I am not being critical of the actor or his talent, just the casting.\" Co-producer and co-screenwriter Roberto Orci addressed the issue of the casting: In 2016, ScreenRant rated Khan as the 6th-best character in Star Trek'' overall."

Music, called it a \"fun 'n' feisty opener\" for Iraheta's debut album Just Like You, concluding that it was \"arguably the best debut single by an Idol ever.\". Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly calls the song \"an aggressively jaunty kiss-off track that juxtaposes genuine hard-edged attitude from (Allison) with a chorus as unapologetically addictive as Grape Bubble Yum,\" concluding that it is \"exactly the kind of real world, post-Idol response Allison will need to propel herself from reality TV contestant to Billboard-charting threat,\" even if \"Martin has ironed out Allison's vocals a little too aggressively on the chorus.\". MJ Santilli, who the Los Angeles Times describes as the \"top\" blogger for idol-watchers, writes \"The tune opens with a simple Kinks-like guitar riff, giving way in the chorus to some 80's-like electronica\u2013a cool meld of old school sounds ... Allison's husky alto is front and center here. I'm relieved her vocals weren\u2019t pro-tooled into oblivion. Teen-friendly pop/rock is exactly what I was expecting from Allison right out of the gate.\" Reviewers from publications which do not primarily cover Idol-related works have also praised the song. Lehigh Valley Music writer John J. Moser describes the song as \"rock-oriented (with) a very heavy pop production to make it uber-catchy.\" Jenny Kobiela-Mondor of FW Daily News said that \"Friday I'll Be Over U\" \"reminds me of Kelly Clarkson, but a twinge edgier ... a solid song for teens, and one that I'm sure many girls will be singing loudly in their bedrooms and their cars.\" Kieran Layton, the Arts and Entertainment Editor for The Pitt News, praises the single for painting Allison \"as a standout rock chick who comes across as the love child of Pink, Kelly Clarkson and Courtney Love circa her Hole days,\" describing the song as a \"treat.\" On December 22, 2009, Pop Justice selected \"Friday I'll Be Over U\" as its song of the day."

He called the five-star lineup of T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, and Rick Ross on \"All I Do Is Win\" the gold medal track, with the Young Jeezy showcase \"Put Your Hands Up\" winning the silver. He stated Bun B's help on the song \"Rockin\u2019 All My Chains On\" helps score the bronze, giving the track a slight edge over the hood reggae number \"Killing Me,\" which partners Busta Rhymes with Jamaican stars Buju Banton and Bounty Killer. Through intros and shout-outs, Khaled puts more of himself into this personal, story-telling album, and while this supposedly troubled effort seems complete and sound, for the most part. He disliked the closing song \"Rep My City\" saying that it \"is the least satisfying number and is best thought of as a bonus track\". In conclusion he said \"(the album) is as satisfying as his other mega-star-studded albums, with the added benefit of being more cohesive and significantly more purposeful. Edwin Ortiz of HipHopDX praised the single \"Fed Up\" with an all-star lineup and a catchy hook by Usher. But said the song \"On My Way\" got a bit tiring with eight different artists on the track. He also disliked the songs \"Bring the Money Out\" and \"Rockin' All My Chains On\". Talking about \"Rockin' All My Chains On\" he stated that it's almost downright unfair to put Birdman and Soulja Boy on the same song as Bun B. He applauded Nas' performance in \"Victory\". In conclusion he said that \"We may look back on DJ Khaled\u2019s legacy in Hip Hop and see some shining moments. However, Victory as a whole product will certainly not be one of them.\""

Merritt said he \"thought of the two records as a pair\" and considered titling the albums True and False, but ultimately could not decide which title would correspond with which album. The song \"The Dada Polka\" is the only track to feature an electric guitar. Merritt also avoided using a traditional drum kit, further separating the sound of Realism from the noise pop of Distortion. Along with Distortion and the 2004 album i, Realism was also recorded without the use of synthesizers, completing the band's \"no-synth trilogy\". Joshua Rifkin, who arranged the Judy Collins albums In My Life and Wildflowers, was cited by Merritt as a creative influence for Realism."

Dan McIntosh of Roughstock gave a mostly negative review, saying that the Hall & Oates cover \"certainly smells like a deceptive ploy to attract middle-aged female music fans.\" He also criticized the themes of most songs by saying, \"One also gathers that Wayne is convinced women today are looking for transparent men of their word.\" McIntosh's review also criticized the album for a lack of up-tempo material."

Good Gracious still falls prey to some of the lazy tempos that pop up on most Lou Donaldson records, but it remains one of his finest soul-jazz sessions\".

The vocalist has also released seven DJ albums, three EPs and a soundtrack album. Boy George was born as George Alan O'Dowd on 14 June 1961 in Bexley, London, England. The singer was essentially part of the English New Romantic movement which emerged in the early 1980s. He helped give androgyny an international stage with the success of Culture Club during the 1980s. His music is often classified as blue-eyed soul, influenced by rhythm and blues and reggae. Between 1989 and 1992, he also founded and was lead singer of Jesus Loves You, which performed house and dance music. In the 1990s and 2000s, Boy George's solo music reveals also glam rock influences such as David Bowie and Iggy Pop. Being involved in many activities (among them songwriting, DJing, writing books, designing clothes and photography), he has released fewer music recordings in the 21st century."

On the last date of the tour in Miami, the famed lead singer of Judas Priest, Rob Halford (who at the time was the lead singer for Fight), sang guest vocals on stage for a performance of \"Rapid Fire\" from his band's 1980 album British Steel. This was also the last tour that Metallica played in standard tuning before tuning down to E\u266d standard, due to James Hetfield's deteriorating vocals from the recent large-scale tour in support of Metallica (commonly known as the Black Album). This tour was also the first tour featuring Lars Ulrich's down-scaled drum kits. According to Ulrich's interview on guitar center in 2014, two rack toms were removed from his original drum setup thus allowing the hi-hat cymbal and ride cymbal to be placed nearer to him and making his drum kit easier to play. Supporting acts for this tour were Danzig, Suicidal Tendencies (whose bassist Robert Trujillo would join Metallica nine years later), Candlebox, and Fight. Alice in Chains was planned to be one of the opening acts, but were forced to withdraw from the tour due to vocalist Layne Staley's heroin addiction. The Offspring (who had just released their breakthrough album Smash) were reportedly invited to replace Alice in Chains on this tour, but declined due to their desire to continue playing in clubs. Fight was eventually chosen to replace Alice in Chains. Despite the band's withdrawal, Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell joined Metallica on \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" during their August 9, 1994 performance in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."

Bearing something of a resemblance to \"We've Only Just Begun\", the song was a potential Carpenters single release in 1971 being Karen Carpenter's choice to follow \"For All We Know\", but Richard Carpenter doubted the hit potential of \"Let Me Be the One\" and the choice for single was assigned to \"Rainy Days and Mondays\". However the album cut \"Let Me Be the One\" did receive airplay on both Top 40 and MOR radio stations. Paul Williams has described \"Let Me Be the One\" as \"one of those songs that everybody's recorded but it's never been a [major hit] single. It was used very briefly by ABC-TV in 1976 and Channel 9 Australia in 1977: Let us be the one you turn to/ Let us be the one you turn to/ When you need someone you turn to/ Let us be the one.\" The 1991 remix for \"Let Me Be the One\" can only be found on the From the Top box set, for which it was released as a promotional single. It starts off with Karen counting off, and Richard's piano line is very different from the original 1971 mix found on the Carpenters album. In the original 1971 mix, the song fades out; the 1991 remix continues through to the point where Karen and the rest of the musicians create a conclusion."

Because the music strayed from  standard cantopop fare, only one single was released from the album. There are eight Cantonese songs and two original English compositions, one of which is a duet with a local jazz musician, Larry Hammond. The album includes two cover versions: \"\u4e09\u5341\u5ea6 (Thirty Degrees)\" was originally the popular song, \"The Girl from Ipanema\". \"Love Me\" is the Bee Gees' song. With the release of this album, Liew fulfilled her contract with Columbia Records and took a break for several years, emigrating with her children to San Francisco, USA. Her next release was the mandopop album, Love Yourself \u611b\u81ea\u5df1, released in Taiwan in May 2000. Her next cantopop album was 15 years after this release, in October 2009, with The Queen of Hardships. The title of this album is a play on words of the classic Chinese saying, \"\u65e5\u6709\u6240\u601d\uff0c\u591c\u6709\u6240\u5922\", which literally translates to \"thoughts during the day, dreams in the night\".

Drop into background landscapes of milky way-out keyboards and slivers of airy guitar. Oh, did I mention that the foreground vocals are patent 'Teau Twin ringlets of bliss?\" He added that the song \"slowly plunges as Frazer's voice soars into a firmament crowded with spacey snippets of computerized sound.\" Chuck Campbell from Knoxville News-Sentinel described \"the gorgeous strains\" as \"typical Cocteau Twins triumphs, aural massages of magical quality.\" He noted that \"the instruments supply an air of dreamy melancholia that both chills and warms.\" A reviewer from Lennox Herald called it \"a fine effort\". American magazine Musician noted its \"sly pop appeal\" and stated that \"the candyland blur of the Cocteaus' sound has never been so alluring\". Martin Aston from Music Week deemed it \"a slow, stately affair with all their charm and melodic ingenuity intact.\" R.S. Murthi from New Straits Times wrote that a song like \"Evangeline\" \"evince concerns that go beyond the ordinary. And the combination of surreal verbal imagery and atmospheric music makes for an engaging mystique.\" Alec Foege from Spin magazine picked it as one of the album's three most successful songs. He said that it \"swells with the effects-treated grandeur of Simon Raymonde and Robin Guthrie's accompaniment\". In his book The Da Capo Companion to 20th-century Popular Music, Phil Hardy described it as \"dreamy\".

It was first released on March 9, 2010, in various countries via digital download as the album's lead single by Fueled by Ramen. McCoy co-wrote the song with its producers Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine of the Smeezingtons. The song was created from a melody hummed by Mars and Lawrence. The lyrics were written during an eleven-day trip Mars and Levine made to London to work on a record, supported by Mars's label. \"Billionaire\" is a reggae and pop-rap song. Critical reception towards the song was mixed, as music critics praised the song's style comparing it to the music of Sublime, Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson, but criticized its songwriting. Lyrically, the song has a money-driven hook with political elements in the verses. Such elements include helping those in need, having a show like Oprah and being on the cover of Forbes magazine once McCoy becomes a billionaire. The single reached number one in the Netherlands, number two in Ireland and New Zealand, and also reached the top five in the United Kingdom and the United States. It was certified four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and two-times by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and Music Canada (MC). The accompanying music video for \"Billionaire\", directed by Mark Staubach, was filmed at various locations in Los Angeles, California. It features McCoy driving a Mini Cooper with Mars in the passenger seat. Mars and McCoy, with former Fall Out Boy Pete Wentz on the back, are shown riding different scooters. The video is interpolated with footage of McCoy helping four people, as well a large group at the end. McCoy and Mars performed the song live on Jay Leno's The Tonight Show and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. It was also part of Mars's Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show in 2014. The song was re-recorded by Brazilian singer Claudia Leitte; her version outperformed the original single reaching number three on the Billboard Brazil Hot 100 Airplay chart.

        "content": "During the summer of 2009, the Smeezingtons, consisting of Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, were booked for a week of writing sessions for Lupe Fiasco, B.o.B and Travie McCoy. The first song the team worked on and recorded with McCoy was \"One at a Time\", released as a charity single for MTV's Staying Alive Foundation. Mars and Lawrence usually hummed melodies, while Aaron Bay-Schuck, former Atlantic Records A&R rep, encouraged them to develop the best of those, such as \"Nothin' on You\" and \"Billionaire\". In the beginning, they had only \"scratch chorus demos of \"Nothin' On You\" and \"Billionaire\", with a guitar on the backing track and Mars singing on top of it. It was the first song McCoy began to work on after abandoning the original material for the album. Mars came up with the lyrical concept for \"Billionaire\" during a trip to London, to work on a record. He and Ari Levine were each given \u00a3240 ($350) by Mars's record label to live on for eleven days. Mars found the amount of money to be insufficient, and explained, \"We were like, 'Is this the biggest mistake we've ever made? We thought we were broke in California; what are we going to do here?' So we've got no money, and I'm walking the streets and came up with, 'I wanna be a billionaire, so frickin' bad'\". Mars also claimed that his own finances inspired him to write the track, \"I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about, you know, I can\u2019t afford to get breakfast, so I\u2019ll wait until lunchtime to eat\". When Mars first showed McCoy the hook, the latter decided to decline the collaboration, saying to him: \"Dude, we're in a recession right now. I'm gonna get crucified\". Nevertheless, when McCoy later returned home to Miami, he realized the track \"had potential\". From then on, the rapper began writing his verses with \"goofy humor and flashes of political conscience\" that \"counterbalanced the hook's materialism\". McCoy claimed he \"made it more relatable\". McCoy intended to avoid \"superficial\" lyrics in the song in the wake of an economic recession, and added, \"There's something to sing about here; if I was in the position to have a ridiculous amount of money, would I be selfish or selfless?' I just took that concept and ran with it\". According to Mars, he and McCoy \"came up\" with the song after listening to the Beatles' \"Can't Buy Me Love\". Mars was not supposed to feature on the hook of \"Billionaire\", however, his \"charisma\" when he sang it prompted the label and McCoy to keep his vocal after the final version was recorded. On January 28, 2014, Demetrius Orlandus Proctor filed a lawsuit, claiming to hold the copyright for \"Billionaire\". Proctor alleged he has owned the copyright to the track's music and lyrics since March 31, 2011, though the song was released a year before. As evidence, he submitted a United States Copyright Office registration certificate for Frisky Vol. 1 to 30 (Tapes), issued in 2000. In the suit, Proctor accused McCoy and Mars of \"willful and intentional\" infringement of copyright, and sought the destruction of all copies of the recording. Proctor claimed he has exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the song."

MTV News' Tamar Anitai thought the song gave her a Jason Mraz, Jack Johnson and Shwayze's \"Corona and Lime\" (2008) summer vibe. James Montgomery felt the same way, dubbing it as \"sunny, shiny, breezy and blissed-out\". Mars's style of singing has also been compared to that of Jack Johnson. \"Billionaire\" was composed in the key of A major at a tempo of 80 beats per minute. Lyrically, the chorus of the song is materialistic, money-driven\u2014\"I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad\"\u2014with amusing and political verses counterbalancing it. The songwriting concerns the lifestyle that McCoy and Mars would have with such money, including the fashion, luxury, \"shoulder-rubbing\", and influence. It goes into detail, outlining McCoy's wish list for when he becomes a billionaire. He fantasizes about success, helping after Hurricane Katrina, having a show like Oprah Winfrey, meeting The Queen and adopting unfortunate children. On the other hand, Mars expresses interest in having his name \"in shining lights\" and appearing on the cover of Forbes magazine. Sharyar Rizvi of the Dallas Observer compared the lyrics of \"Billionaire\" to those of Nas' \"If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)\" (1996) and Barenaked Ladies' \"If I Had $1000000\" (1992). McCoy said \"Billionaire\" is an update on George Barr McCutcheon's novel Brewster's Millions (1903) with him giving out money and \"fulfilling\" desires."

        "content": "\"Billionaire\" received mixed reviews from  music critics. Nick Levine of Digital Spy rated the song four out of five stars, dubbing it a \"summer pop treat so sweet and tasty it's even possible to forgive McCoy's slightly irritating change of billing\". James Montgomery of MTV News enjoyed the track, commenting that it \"is perfect for the sunshine\" and raises spirits to become a \"summertime smash\". USA Today Jerry Shriver praised the single, finding it \"hilarious\". Fraser McAlpine from BBC Chart Blog gave the single four stars. He commented that the track is \"optimistic\" and cheerful, with a positive message of \"hope and generosity\". Nevertheless, McAlpine criticized the use of explicit language, calling it \"a little ripe for genteel ears\". In a mixed review, Billboard Melanie Bertoldi awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that the song's lyrics \"may be inconsistent, but the beat still goes down smoothly\". Rodrigo Perez of MTV News praised the song's instrumentation but criticized its lyrics, calling them a \"laundry list of wishes\". The New York Times Jon Caramanica said the song has a \"moody underbelly\", complementing its \"stirring hook\", also noting that McCoy takes a \"quick potshot\" at his ex Katy Perry in one of the verses. In a negative review, Nick Messitte writing for Forbes criticized the single for copying the Sublime's \"Santeria\" (1997). Mike Diver of BBC dubbed the reggae stylings of \"Billionaire\" as \"horribly dated\". Likewise, Sharyar Rizvi of the Dallas Observer heavily criticized the song's lyrics saying they, \"sound a bit like other songs that explain what the musician would do if they had a bunch of money or ruled the world\". Rizvi added that she would like to see McCoy to do some philanthropic work as he promised in the song. At the 2011 ASCAP Pop Music Awards, \"Billionaire\" was one of the winners of Most Performed Songs. It earned a nomination for Choice Music: Summer Song at the 2010 Teen Choice Awards."

Released in 1981, it is third in a series of records done for the label Blue Sky Records under producer/guitarist Johnny Winter. Recorded in three days (and in the wake of Muddy's failing health) some of the band members, namely Winter and guitarist Bob Margolin, were not happy with the result. As his health deteriorated, Muddy was forced to cancel an increasing number of shows. He died of a heart attack on April 30, 1983. The album was recorded in May 1980. A salary dispute between the band and Muddy Waters's manager, Scott Cameron, halted the session. Eventually the album was completed by using a couple of outtakes from 1977's Hard Again."

The song features verses from rapper Snoop Dogg. The artists co-wrote the song with Bonnie McKee and its co-producers Dr. Luke and Max Martin, with additional production from Benny Blanco. According to Perry, \"California Gurls\" is an answer song to \"Empire State of Mind\" (2009), by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys. Its midtempo production incorporates disco-pop and funk-pop with influences of new wave and electropop. Its lyrics are an ode to the state of California, in which both Perry and Snoop Dogg were born and raised. \"California Gurls\" garnered positive reviews from music critics, with the majority of them labeling it a \"summer anthem\", as well as complimenting its production and chorus. Originally, the song was intended to be sent to mainstream and rhythmic airplay on May 25, 2010, the song debuted on May 7, 2010, after clips from the Teenage Dream album were leaked online. It was subsequently released to iTunes on May 11, 2010, as the album's lead single.

It has also been noted that the video was influenced by several other works, including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and the board game Candyland. On December 2, 2010, the song received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. In 2012, Billboard ranked the song number one on a special The 30 Summer Songs of All Time listing."

She said that she wanted to write a song about California girls. During a Rolling Stone photo shoot in April 2010, Perry revealed details about the song, reportedly a response to Jay-Z's \"Empire State of Mind\", she stated: Initially, the song was going to be titled \"California Girls\", but, the spelling was changed to \"California Gurls\" after the passing of Big Star member Alex Chilton as a nod to their song, \"September Gurls\". After the song was leaked online, Capitol Records decided to release it early, and it was posted on Perry's official website, and the radio date was moved up from May 25, 2010, to May 7, 2010. The artwork was also released, featuring Perry laying out on the beach sand with a bejeweled bikini. Perry used Wikipedia to research which rapper she wanted to collaborate with for \"California Gurls\", browsing West Coast artists before selecting Snoop Dogg. The publishing company for The Beach Boys had allegedly threatened a lawsuit due to Snoop Dogg's line \"I wish they could all be California Girls\", which they consider to be one of the classic lines in the band's song \"California Girls\". \"California Gurls\" is composed in styles of disco-pop, funk-pop and bubblegum pop while bearing influence of new wave music and electropop within its composition. According to digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony-ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of F major and the tempo moves at 126 beats per minute over a house beat. Perry's vocal range in the song spans from the lower note of C4 to the higher note of D5. \"California Gurls\" utilizes multiple synths, drums, funk guitars, and electronic whooshes in its production."

Steve Leftridge of PopMatters called \"California Gurls\" the radio jam of the summer of 2010 and \"the gargantuan singalong fantasy that delivered on the promise built by the disco thump of hits like 'I Kissed a Girl' and 'Hot n Cold'.\" Leftridge also praised the song's musical composition, lyrical content and its chorus which he said \"you know by heart halfway through your first listen.\" The track was deemed as a highlight on Teenage Dream by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic. Michael Cragg of musicOMH praised the song, \"First single California Gurls is brilliant, brattish fun, Perry sounding sweet and coy on the verses before that huge chorus erupts\". Edna Gundersen of USA Today said that the track is \"an effervescent toast to summer fun.\" Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune, however, dismissed the song as \"relentlessly mechanical\". He went on to describe Perry's vocal performance on the song as \"a series of syllables digitally stitched together.\" The single received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. On May 25, 2012, Billboard ranked the song number one on a special The 30 Summer Songs of All Time listing."

        "content": "The video was directed by Mathew Cullen and was inspired by the work of Will Cotton, who was also the artistic director of the video. Filming of the video began on May 14, 2010. It premiered on June 15, 2010. Perry explained the use of a candy theme instead of a beach theme for the video, saying, \"It's definitely something to watch when you have the munchies. ... It's all edible. We named it 'Candyfornia' instead of 'California', so it's a different world,\" she said. \"It's not just like, 'Oh, let's go to the beach and throw a party and then shoot a music video!' It's more like, 'Let's put us California Gurls in a whole different world!\" The video has been controversial since several people have accused Katy Perry of copying the video of the song \"Fergalicious\" by Fergie. This is due to the similarity of the set and the outfits used for the video. In the music video, Perry is a game piece in Candyfornia, a game based in poker and board games. The settings are inspired in part by Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and the board game Candy Land, with much of the set decorated with cupcakes, ice creams, cotton candy, and lollipops. Snoop Dogg appears in the video as a king named \"Sugar Daddy\" that is holding several young women (Queens of Candyfornia) captive throughout the game, using candy-related devices to hold them. Perry moves around, experimenting with objects. She moves through the land, making discoveries and freeing the women. In the chorus, she appears lying down on a cotton candy cloud, naked. Snoop Dogg tries to block her advances in many ways. When all the women are free, Perry leads them in a dance on the beach. Seeing the women freed, \"Sugar Daddy\" becomes enraged, marching on the women's position with an army of gummy bears. Perry, dressed in a red Wonder Woman-like costume, quickly defeats the army with whipped cream guns attached to her breasts, after which the stunned king throws down his staff and surrenders. The video ends with \"Sugar Daddy\" buried up to his neck in the sand by the women, nonetheless admiring their beauty and (in a nod to the Beach Boys song) wishing that women everywhere could be California girls. Various California landmarks appear in the video, such as the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Hollywood Sign and some West Coast beaches which were all made out of confectionery."

        "content": "\"Romeo Is Bleeding\" is a song written and performed by Tom Waits, and released on his 1978 album, Blue Valentine. The lyrics make frequent use of Spanish, including phrases such as \"Hey Pachuco!\", \"D\u00e1me esa pistola, hombre!\" (Give me that pistol, man!), \"Hijo de la chingada madre!\" (You son of a fucking whore!), and \"Vamos a dormir, hombre\" (Let's go to sleep, man). Waits also makes a reference to gangster movie-star James Cagney, also mentioned in \"Invitation to the Blues\" from the album Small Change. Jay S. Jacobs, in his book Wild years: the music and myth of Tom Waits, describes \"Romeo is Bleeding\" as depicting \"a guy who sticks a shiv into the local sheriff [and] is fatally shot in the chest \u2014 a familiar Waits image, with echoes of West Side Story\". Waits had more overtly referenced West Side Story earlier on the Blue Valentine album, with \"Somewhere\" as the opening track. According to Waits, the song is based on a real incident in Los Angeles, and concerns \"a Mexican gang leader who was shot and died in a movie house in downtown L.A.\" Music critic Adrian Denning wrote that \"one song that would, could and SHOULD rank amongst [Waits'] finest moments is the fabulous Jazz swing and late night seedy feel of 'Romeo is Bleeding.'\" While lukewarm towards Blue Valentine in general, Denning remarked that the song \"corrects matters somewhat,\" citing the song's \"great vocals and... bass groove.\" Robert Christgau wrote that \"Romeo is Bleeding\" was \"easily my favorite among his Chandleroid sagas of tragedy outside the law,\" but added that it is \"more effective on the jacket than when he [Waits] underlines its emotional resonance in song.\" Patrick Humphries, in his book The many lives of Tom Waits, was unimpressed, labelling the song a \"rewrite\" of Waits' 1976 song, \"Small Change.\" The song later lent its name to the Peter Medak film Romeo Is Bleeding, which starred Gary Oldman."

He performs mostly little-known standards (along with six of his originals) and displays a fair amount of originality and a great deal of potential that was never really fulfilled. Recommended\"."

It was the lead single from the band's third album Waking Up with the House on Fire. The song became the group's seventh top-five hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number two. In the U.S. the single peaked at #17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and hit the top ten in many countries including Canada (#3), Ireland (#1) and Australia (#2). The music video was directed by Russell Mulcahy. Lead singer Boy George is shown with flame-red hair, a provocative new look at the time, as well as black, white, yellow and blue wigs. The ending of the video features hundreds of children dressed as skeletons, frolicking around Shad Thames, London. The video cost more than \u00a3100,000 to make. When Pete Burns saw the video, he sent Boy George a wreath. In many countries, the single was released with a B-Side consisting of a native-language version (Spanish, French, Japanese or German) of the song. It was available in two different extended versions, a first in Culture Club discography. Its 7\" picture disc was shelved, and remaining copies are very rare. Boy George later said The War Song had \"patronising lyrics and a brain-curdling melody.\"  It has been excluded from some compilations of Culture Club music. It had not been performed live by Culture Club since 1985, until the band played it at a one-off gig on New Year's Eve 2011.  They also peformed the song in 2014. The War Song was Culture Club's last UK top 5 hit before 1998's \"I Just Wanna Be Loved\"."

Regarding the new album's musical direction, drummer John Boecklin stated, \"It's interesting to me \u2014 it's not the fastest shit we have done, nor the slowest, [but it] just [has] lots of groove. But to me, when people say 'it's got groove,' I think it's a nice way of saying simple and boring these days. We wanted to avoid this. \"Our record has a great contrast of dark riffs, stomp bouncing drums with the right amount of blasts and double bass, and outstanding vocal delivery from Dez that takes it past your average approach of the metal attempt. I'm not talking about reinventing the wheel or nothing. I just think our new album sits in its own corner from any of our other albums.\" The band recorded 14 songs during the Beast sessions, with 12 tracks making the standard version of the CD and all 14 songs appearing on the special edition. The special edition also includes the band's documentary You May Know Us from the Stage and official music videos spanning DevilDriver's career thus far."

        "content": "Goodbye Lullaby is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer and songwriter Avril Lavigne. It was released on March 2, 2011 through RCA Records. Recording sessions for the album began in November 2008 and continued over a period of nearly two years, concluding in October 2010. Goodbye Lullaby is a primarily a pop rock album and is considered a more introspective record from Lavigne in comparison to her previous material, consisting mainly of stripped down instruments such as the piano and acoustic guitar. Lavigne assumed an integral role in the album's production and co-wrote every original track on Goodbye Lullaby, as well as collaborating with several producers including Max Martin, Shellback, Butch Walker, and her ex-husband Deryck Whibley. Goodbye Lullaby is Lavigne's third and final studio album released by RCA, following The Best Damn Thing (2007). Upon its release, Goodbye Lullaby received generally mixed reviews from music critics, with some naming it her most personal and introspective album while others took issue with its subdued sound and Lavigne's lyrical content. The album debuted inside the top five in over 15 countries such as the United States and Canada (where it has since been certified gold) and topping the charts in over eight countries, such as Australia, Greece, Hong Kong and Japan. Three singles were released from Goodbye Lullaby. \"What the Hell\" was released as the lead single in January 2011 and achieved worldwide chart success, reaching the top 20 in the United States and United Kingdom, the top ten in Europe and Australia and the top five in Asia. The following singles, \"Smile\" and \"Wish You Were Here\", had moderate chart success worldwide. The album also includes an extended version of the soundtrack single for Alice in Wonderland (2010), titled \"Alice\". Lavigne promoted the album with a series of live performances and later embarked on The Black Star Tour (2011)."

        "content": "Lavigne's third studio album, The Best Damn Thing (2007), was a great commercial success, mainly due to its lead-single, \"Girlfriend\" (a number-one hit in over six countries) and its successful worldwide tour, The Best Damn World Tour (2008). In September 2009, it was reported that Lavigne and husband Deryck Whibley were separating. The same day, MTV News reported that he was working with her on the follow-up album to The Best Damn Thing. They used their home studio to produce eight of the nine tracks she initially recorded for the album. \"I think this is taking the spirit of what she's done on previous records so much further,\" he said. \"It's way more meaningful, has more of an impact, more emotional. It makes me feel something more than the other stuff. And I wanted to match that musically with the track.\" The album and lead single's release dates had been pushed back several times. The album was originally scheduled for release on November 17, 2009. Later, in January 2010, Lavigne stated that the album cover had been photographed and the first single would be released in April followed by the album in June. In May, Lavigne said that she considered the album too serious and \"mellow\" and would return to the studio to balance the album out, \"With an album, I don't want to rush it out.... I have a very serious record, so I think I need to put a couple upbeat, fun songs on it.\" In August 2010, Lavigne returned to Henson Recording Studios with producer Alex da Kid. During these sessions, Lavigne had strep throat, and the people involved were required to wear surgical masks. Despite her doctor's warning, Lavigne recorded vocals, \"I wasn't able to sing for the last forty-eight hours because I could do permanent damage to the vocal cords.\" She revealed that she had been \"trying new stuff\" and that she was \"exploring\". Lavigne added that she had enough material for two records. In October 2010, Lavigne was featured in Maxim for the November issue. During the interview she revealed that she had finished Goodbye Lullaby after two and a half years. However, in November, Lavigne announced that her album had been completed for a year, citing her record company as the reason for the album's delays. Lavigne stated that her record company wanted something more upbeat to keep up with mainstream radio, \"Radio's very rhythmic and urban and dance today. I think they wanted me to do something more like that, but that's not what my vision was for this album\". The entire track listing for the album was revealed on December 21, 2010, after some were announced in early December."

        "content": "Lavigne began recording in her home studio in November 2008 with the song \"Black Star\", only a month after completing The Best Damn Tour. To help promote her first fragrance, Black Star, Lavigne needed a short theme that would be used for the TV spots. \"Black Star\" was composed in a Malaysian hotel during her tour. The jingle was eventually expanded into a short introduction to the album. Recording began with minimal instruments, usually starting with Lavigne singing only to acoustic guitar, with additional instruments added later. Lavigne stated that her vocals were the most important instrument to her during the album's recording, \"Typically the lead vocal gets buried in the track and you can't always hear the quality, character, or emotion after a certain point. I wanted my voice to be the main instrument.\" Lavigne described the process: \"It's stripped down. I love performing that way, so I really felt like it was time to make a record like that. To just make it all about the vocal and the performance, and the vibe, and the emotion.\" Because she has a studio in her home, Lavigne was able to compose and record at her leisure. She also used the piano to compose the majority of the songs. \"The piano is more of an emotional instrument. It stirs up different emotions for me and moves me in a different way than the guitar can.\" By July 2009, nine tracks had been recorded, including the songs \"Fine\", \"Everybody Hurts\" and \"Darlin'\", the latter being the second song Lavigne wrote as a 15-year-old while living in Napanee, Ontario. Lavigne stated that this album would be different from her previous work, \"The other albums I've done, the songs are all over the place. This is the most consistent album all the way through.\" In addition to working with Deryck Whibley in the majority of the songs, Lavigne also produced two songs on her own and worked with Max Martin and Shellback. \"What was really great about working with Max was, I flew out to Sweden for a couple weeks, sat down, played him my record, got to know each other, wrote some songs together, and then I was out,\" she told MTV News. \"It switched it up for me. It was a new creative space, a new relationship, and we got a lot done. He's very talented.\" Lavigne's longtime collaborators Evan Taubenfield and Butch Walker co-wrote and produced some of the tracks as well. In November 2010, British producer Alex da Kid, who worked with Lavigne beginning in August 2010, stated that some songs on the album will have a hip-hop sound, \"We've got some things that are hip-hop leaning, and we've got some things that are more pop/rock leaning\". In December, it was announced that the songs produced by Alex da Kid would not be on the album but Lavigne stated, \"we're gonna do something with that stuff, I'm just not sure what yet\"."

        "title": "Goodbye Lullaby_Composition and themes",
        "content": "\"Goodbye Lullaby\" deals with themes of heartbreak and was heavily influenced on Lavigne's relationship with her ex-husband Deryck Whibley. Lavigne described the album as being about how we all go through difficult experiences, whether it's ending a relationship, losing a job, or just missing someone. She stated, \"It's so easy for me to do a boy-bashing pop song, but to sit down and write honestly about something that's really close to me, something I've been through, it's a totally different thing.\" The album serves as a return to Lavigne's older musical style and is largely acoustic. With the exception of the album's lead single, Lavigne describes the songs on the album as different from her earlier material, \"I'm older now, so I think that comes across in my music, it's not as pop-rock and it's a little more mellow and it's deep\". She said, \"[For] this record, I just really, really wanted to sing.... I just wanna have silence around me, and have these acoustic songs and really deliver.\" For Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, \"these mellow acoustic songs paint a mournful, lamenting picture of a woman trying to sort through why her marriage failed.\" The album opens with the intro \"Black Star\", which lasts for 1 minute and 34 seconds, and was described by Rolling Stone as \"an ethereal lullaby that turns epic with tinkling Coldplay-like pianos and soaring strings.\" The second track and first single off the album, \"What the Hell\", was described by Lavigne herself as \"a broad message about personal freedom\", calling it her \"most pop track on the record\", the least personal song from the album and the song most reminiscent of her previous work. In \"Push\", she forcefully tells a guy to stop complaining about how hard it can be to make a relationship work, while the power ballad \"Wish You Were Here\" shows Lavigne's vulnerable side, and according to Spins Mikael Wood, \"talks about her recent divorce from Deryck Whibley\". The other upbeat, pop rock track \"Smile\", finds Lavigne referring to herself as a \"crazy bitch\" and expressing her gratitude for special people in her life. The sixth track \"Stop Standing There\", written only by herself, has been described as having an \"early- '50s girl-group feel\", while lyrically it finds Lavigne imploring a hesitant suitor to confess his affection. The seventh track \"I Love You\" fondly reminisces about how Avril loved getting drunk with her ex, among other things, while \"Everybody Hurts\" ponders why things turned out as they have and longs for a second chance. For Andy Greenwald of Entertainment Weekly, \"Not Enough\" is a raw confessional track, while \"4 Real\", written and produced by herself, concerns about authenticity in a lover, with Lavigne insisting that her partner be \"4 real,\" because everything feels right. Acoustic guitar and piano, as well as an orchestra are used in \"Darlin'\", \"Remember When\" and \"Goodbye\". \"Darlin'\" was written when Lavigne was 14 years old. \"Whenever I hear 'Darlin,' I think of the family room I wrote it in and playing it for my mom,\" she says. \"So it's really special for me to have it on the album.\" \"Remember When\" realizes that the breaking of what's supposed to be an eternal bond has serious emotional consequences as it captures the ache of post-divorce loneliness. The final track \"Goodbye\" talks about finding the strength to close one chapter of her life and move on to the next. Lavigne stated that it was the most personal song she has ever wrote and was the inspiration for the album's title. The hidden track \"Alice\" was made for Tim Burton's film fantasy Alice in Wonderland, which was included on the compilation album Almost Alice. The album's version differs lyrically from the soundtrack's."

The song was a very moderate success on the charts, only reaching the top-forty in Australia, Austria, Germany and New Zealand. In the U.S., it only reached number 68. Lavigne confirmed in July 2011 that \"Wish You Were Here\" would become the third and final single from Goodbye Lullaby, released on September 9, 2011. Previously charting in the US and Canada through downloads alone, when the album was released in March 2011, the song performed very modestly as a single, only reaching number 64 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart and number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song's music video, directed by Marc Webb, features Avril very emotional in a room, looking sad, lighting flora on fire and dunking her head underwater in a bathtub. \"Push\" was released on February 20, 2012 exclusively in Japan, reaching a peak of 35 on the Japan Hot 100."

        "content": "Goodbye Lullaby received mixed reviews from music critics based on aggregate score of 58 from Metacritic. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic compared Goodbye Lullaby to Under My Skin, citing the divorce from Deryck Whibley as \"the occasion for introspection\". However, he noticed that Lavigne \"seems to be grappling with emotions just beyond her reach, never articulating her angst or crafting a melancholy melody, making Goodbye Lullaby feel affected, not genuine.\" Likewise, Andy Greenwald of Entertainment Weekly thought that the album \"seeks a balance,\" since \"the first half is loaded with glossy confections, while the second consists of quieter reflections clearly inspired by Deryck Whibley, her ex-husband.\" Giving a grade of B-, Greenwald found out that the singer \"seems to be desperate to share her artistic interior, which is far from fully formed.\" Bill Lamb from About.com echoed the same thought, writing that the album is \"very downbeat and subdued,\" praising the two songs produced by herself, but ultimately calling it \"a bit like a wasted moment in time.\" Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine gave the album 2.5 out of 5 stars, calling it \"a strident, ineffectual attempt at a serious pop record.\" Josh Langhoff of PopMatters found problems with its lyrics, pointing out that \"she's an artist who benefits from collaboration.\" Writing for the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail Robert Everett-Green also criticized the lyrics, writing that, \"The songs contain little to catch the ear of anyone who isn't already a fan. This is disposable, industrial pop, short on invention and buffed to a high gloss.\" In contrast to the mixed reviews, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, highlighting its production, calling it \"a solid collection of tunes that neatly ties together the sounds of her last three records: the angst of 'Let Go', the raw emotion of 'Under My Skin' and the pop hooks of 'The Best Damn Thing'.\" Billboard Magazine was also favorable, naming the album \"the songstress' most intimate and soul-baring set to date.\" Jon Pareles from The New York Times was also positive, expressing that \"on Goodbye Lullaby, she's trying to be a little more expansive, vocally and emotionally, without leaving pop territory\". Pareles positively pointed out that, \"It's the pop-factory material, not Ms. Lavigne's own presumably more personal songs, that offers details, humor and a sense of letting go. Her grown-up seriousness could use a little more of them\". Giving 3 stars out of 5, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone was impressed that the album \"is lovelorn and introspective, full of gusty tunes with a surprising message: Avril cares\". Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times found issues \"when Lavigne compartmentalizes her softer side, to the point where it eclipses her finger-jabbing cheekiness.\""

Experience the feel of love.\" According to the same site, the album had created a record with \"good sales right on the first day of release itself.\" Sales executives cited that the single track was \"a chartbuster\", but was \"highly downloaded in internet\" and that \"the trend of single track releases is something new to Kollywood\", pointing to the price of the single (), which was considered too high. The new \"strategical promotional concept\" proved to be successful, as the song became widely popular and was declared a hit by trade pundits. The song particularly enjoyed popularity among the younger generation and had reportedly become a \"rage among the youths.\" Composer Yuvan Shankar Raja himself, however, admitted that he was actually expecting both positive as well as negative feedback for the track. Following the positive response, the Mumbai-based audio company Venus Music, who would market the album, expressed interest in a music video of the song in Hindi language. Silambarasan himself was asked to shoot for the music video, which would be premiered on Bollywood music channels. This would also mark Silambarasan's Bollywood debut.

During one of the final battles between heaven and hell; Thanor the Black Dragon had betrayed Nekron by telling the angels where the son of Kron was hidden from them. When Kron learned of Thanor's betrayal his rage cracked the Earth. Thanor was captured and tortured, but before being killed his eyes had been ripped out of his face. Iras and his companions finally understood. They remembered the stone dragon without eyes guarding Erians book inside the fortress of Har-Kuun, and realized it was indeed Thanor himself. After the Angels had defeated Nekron they banished him from the world and they took Thanor's eyes and turned them into two precious stones, Aelin and Mornir. Later the Angels scattered the stones across the known world to symbolically spread courage and wisdom in Thanor's name. Despite his dark past, Thanor sacrificed his life, to help the Angels' secure victory. As Iras read on, he also learned that on the day of the seventh eclipse the mystic energies of the eclipse would awaken the seven winged demons of Har-Kuun, who would then open the gates of hell and unleash Nekron from his prison. But Erian's book also revealed, that if on the same day Thanor had gotten his eyes back, the scream of his soul would quake the Earth and that he would be able to rise again to stop Nekron's evil plans. Despite the remaining pages missing due to Tarish's betrayal, what they needed to know for sure had been revealed to them. The two precious stones, Thanor's eyes, had to be found. After learning of these events, the Wizards of the White Dragons Order decreed that Iras along with his friends who braved the dangers of Har-Kuun had to travel to the borders of the known world to find the two stones. As the seventh eclipse approached, war was sounding on the horizon. The seven winged demons had been awakened and Nekron was released. Iras and his friends had been able to find the 2 stones and returned to Har-Kuun to place them in the empty spaces on Thanor's statue. Thanor had awakened, and rose from the abyss where Nekron had tortured him. After an epic battle, Thanor returned victorious from destroying the seven winged demons and Nekron, and returned to stone. With Iras and Dargor present, Thanor opened his eyes once again, which were brighter than ever. He chose Dargor to come with him into the afterlife. Dargor being half demon did not understand why he had been chosen, but it was the decision of the gods and angels, because he chose light over darkness despite his past. The Angels deemed him worthy. Dargor's death was only physical, and a new form of life was born. Erian's spirit had embraced Dargor's immortal soul, to become pure divinity, becoming a God of cosmic light, to breathe on the Earth once again."

Rockell also recorded the song for her 2002 album, Instant Pleasure. The song has become a cult hit on many college campuses. The Appalachian State College newspaper asked, on October 17, 2006, whether \"college students have become more concerned with instant pleasure than a meaningful relationship,\" citing Swirsky's song. Drew University's student a cappella group, 36 Madison Avenue, did a version of the song at their Jamfest in 2007.

He sang it again at the Newport Folk Festival on 26 July. Two weeks later, on August 7, he recorded several takes of the song at Columbia's studios in New York City, selecting the initial attempt for release on The Times They Are a-Changin'''. Dylan performed the song at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. Dylan stated of the experience, in the documentary No Direction Home'', \"I looked up from the podium and I thought to myself, 'I've never seen such a large crowd.' I was up close when King was giving that speech. To this day, it still affects me in a profound way.\" Nevertheless he received only scattered applause for the song, reflecting that many marchers did not agree with the sentiments of the song which exonerate Evers's murderer as a poor white man manipulated by race-baiting politicians and the injustices of the social system. The lyrics actually reiterate the claim that the murderer \"can't be blamed. He's only a pawn in their game.\" In fact, the state twice prosecuted the murderer in 1964, but each time the all white jury failed to reach a verdict. Dylan no longer played the song after October 1964. In 1969 the murderer had the original indictment dismissed. However, when these first trials were shown to be held unfairly and with new evidence available the murderer was eventually found guilty on February 5, 1994."

The songs sound very strong to me.\" Turner commented on the atheist nature of closing track, \"Glory Hallelujah\", stating, \"I have played many Christian songs on stage in my time, and have no issue with that; but one time I was singing \u201cMay the Circle Be Unbroken\u201d onstage in Atlanta, with Chuck Ragan, and it occurred to me that it'd be nice if there was a concomitant atheist song, with the same feel, to put the other side of the argument.\""

Basically I turn up with songs that are finished to the extent that they have verses, choruses, middle eights, chord progressions and vocals. I generally have some ideas about what I want people to do. People will suggest a guitar or piano line, but I retain power of veto. It\u2019s a dictatorship, rather than a democracy. To be honest, without getting too precious about this, I pay them to be in my band. I don\u2019t want to be in a band, if I did then I'd do that. This is my project.\" Turner had previously stated, \"I made [the album] with my band, but it feels like more of a solo record than Poetry of the Deed,\" and further elaborated, \"Last time round, I think I was a little excited about having a stable band line-up to take into the studio; also, we worked out all the arrangements in about two weeks of intensive rehearsal. As a result the feel tended towards the rock end of the spectrum and it became a band record \u2013 which is fine, but it\u2019s definitely in the side field of what I want to do. This time we were all on tour together pretty much the whole time when I was writing, which meant we had much longer to work on arrangements, plus I was more confident in not using people on some songs, as opposed to just throwing everything on all the time.\""

Before moving to Brooklyn in 2010, she met with a representative from Epic Records at a SXSW event and was eventually signed to the label in 2009. She began working on the album, collaborating with musicians like Jimmy Harry, Dan Carey, and Lester Mendez. A digital extended play titled Oh Land EP was released in October 2010, featuring five songs that would later appear on the parent album. The album was produced by Carey, Mendez, Dave McCracken, Kristian Leth, and Fridolin Nords\u00f8.  Oh Land covers various genres, such as club, dance, and electropop music. Other influences for the singer included disco and synth-pop. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics; positive comments were aimed at Oh Land's style and her decision to sing the music of several genres. More negative feedback called the songs forgettable and too similar to other artists in the industry. The album was reissued in Denmark on 5 December 2011 and featured five previously unreleased bonus tracks. Five singles were released from the album, including lead single \"Sun of a Gun\" which charted in five countries. \"White Nights\" and \"Speak Out Now\" both charted within the top 20 in Denmark and were certified gold for sales of over 10,000 copies each. \"Wolf & I\" and \"Voodoo\" were released exclusively in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively. Promotional single \"We Turn It Up\" was sent out for airplay rotation in Denmark. The album itself entered the charts in Denmark and the United States, becoming certified platinum in the former country by IFPI Denmark for sales upwards of 20,000 physical copies. In the latter, it entered the lower regions on the Billboard 200, Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts."

It was later released in Canada on 8 February 2011. The standard edition of Oh Land was released firstly in Denmark on 14 March 2011. The following day, it was released in the United States and Canada. It was not released in other European territories until later in the year. A reissued version of Oh Land was distributed exclusively in Denmark on 5 December and featured three previously unreleased bonus tracks (\"Speak Out Now\", \"Twist\", and \"En Linedanser\"), the official music video for \"White Nights\", and a live performance recording of \"We Turn It Up\"."

        "content": "According to Andrew Leahey of AllMusic, Oh Land is a combination of \"club, dance, and nocturnal electro-pop\". The album opens with \"Perfection\", which was co-written and produced by Dan Carey. It features \"dreamy violin-laden confessions\" and was called a \"take on Misery-era Blonde Redhead\" by Drowned in Sounds John Calvert. \"Break the Chain\" references the singer's back injury following a dancing accident, where she refuses doctor's orders by continuing to pursue her dreams; it contains dubstep and flamenco \"undertones\" in addition to shackle sound effects. \"Sun of a Gun\" uses a metaphor regarding the orbit of the sun to describe being in love with someone who is \"destructive\" and \"dangerous\". The song's Europop sound was compared to the works of Kylie Minogue and Goldfrapp. The fourth track and third single, \"Voodoo\", is a synth-pop track that has Oh Land performing a \"spoken word verse over disco beats\". BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine wrote that the track's style was similar to the work of Marina and the Diamonds. He also compared the album's fifth track, \"Lean\", to Massive Attack's \"Teardrop\" (1998). \"Lean\" and \"Wolf & I\" are trip hop tracks, with the latter being described as dramatic by Gaffas Michael Jose Gonzalez. \"Human\", the album's seventh track, is an emo-disco barnstormer\" that sounds Robyn-esque. Barry Walters from Spin stated that the song \"violates just as many grammar rules as the Killers\". \"White Nights\" is the fourth single and is lyrically about dreaming. As described by Leahey from AllMusic, the track blends Motown, synth-pop, and Tropic\u00e1lia into one song. \"Helicopter\" is the ninth track and is a collaboration between Oh Land and songwriter/producer Lester Mendez. It is reminiscent of Feist's work and features \"skittish electronics and dubby beats\". The following track is \"We Turn It Up\", which McAlpine considered \"perky enough to have served as a replacement for that Shakira World Cup song\". It was also described as a \"silly kiss-off party song\". The album closes with \"Rainbow\", which John Calvert felt was influenced by Oh Land's decision to move to Brooklyn."

That same year, a promotional CD single for \"We Turn It Up\" was distributed to radio stations throughout Denmark. From the Danish deluxe edition of Oh Land, bonus track \"Speak Out Now\" was released as a single and then used as the opening and closing theme song to the Danish TV series Rita, which debuted in 2012. \"Twist\" was featured on the official soundtrack to the 2011 film Abduction. She also sang \"Sun of a Gun\" on several occasions, including on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and at a Billboard promotional effort, both in 2011, and at three nightclub shows throughout New York City, immediately following the single's initial release. Oh Land also released a series of promotional music videos for several of the songs on her Vevo account. The video for \"Rainbow\" was released on 16 June 2011 and directed by Eske Kath. Live promotional videos were produced for \"Wolf & I\", \"Sun of a Gun\", \"White Nights\", and \"Perfection\". Other videos displayed Oh Land performing \"Lean\" with a string quartet, playing \"Break the Chain\" with several trash cans, and performing \"Perfection\" with an all-girls chorus. On 24 February 2012, the singer performed various songs from the album live at the Heaven nightclub in London."

Unlike \"Sun of a Gun\", the succeeding two singles did not chart. \"Wolf & I\" served as the second single and was distributed by RCA Records as a CD single in the United States on 13 March 2011. A live rendition of the song was used as the music video and featured Oh Land singing in a room filled with balloons. The album's third single, \"Voodoo\", was released digitally in the United Kingdom on 1 April 2011. \"White Nights\" is the fourth single from Oh Land. A digital EP with four versions of the track was released on 22 May 2011 in Germany. The official music video displays Oh Land in a \"two-sided dream world\" and was released on 9 August 2011. It was successful in Denmark where it peaked at number thirteen and became her first top twenty single. It was later certified gold in that same country for physical sales upwards of 10,000 copies. \"Speak Out Now\" is the album's fifth and final single and was used as a bonus track on the Danish deluxe edition. It also was commercially successful, reaching number four in Denmark and becoming her highest entry on the chart. On Denmark's digital component chart compiled by Billboard, it likewise peaked at number four. Like \"White Nights\", it was also certified gold in her home country."

        "content": "Oh Land received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on seven reviews. Barry Walters of Spin wrote, \"This stunning Dane's synths-plus-strings slant on singer-songwriter lovesickness offers refinement over innovation, yet Nanna \u00d8land Fabricius beguiles with a gently insistent presence.\" Kerri Mason of Billboard opined that Oh Land \"might have made the year's first great left-field pop album\", praising the songs as \"endlessly catchy\" and concluding that \"the tilting scales of light and dark give the collection a definite creep factor and a clever complexity.\" AllMusic's Andrew Leahey described the album as an \"'anything goes' mix\" of multiple genres, adding that Oh Land \"doesn't rewrite the rule book as much as join the ranks of La Roux, Little Boots, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e. But that doesn't keep her debut album from churning out a number of intelligent club anthems\". In a mixed review, Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani expressed that Oh Land's \"cinematic arrangements bring Janelle Mon\u00e1e's ambitious approach to pop music to mind, but tracks like 'Wolf & I' and 'Lean' draw a bit too heavily from the trip-hop playbook [...] and, however well-excecuted they may be, end up sounding derivative.\" Similarly, Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music felt that \"there's a bit of an identity void at the heart of the thing, a lack of personality. It might just be that Oh Land is more skilled at getting songs to sound current than she is at expressing herself.\" Drowned in Sounds John Calvert called the album \"hip, diverse and always vibrant\", but also branded it \"pretty forgettable\". Calvert pointed out the production work of Dave McCracken and Dan Carey, noting the album \"inhabits a tepid middle ground between the two extremes\u2014offering neither gilded Scandi chart-pop (Robyn, Annie) or the artistic mettle of Scandi indie bands, most of whom are able to turn out sublime pop anyway.\""

He was a prolific composer; there are a great many recordings of all of his music\u2014both popular and classical; and it would be impossible to list all of them.  Indeed, there are new performances and recordings of Rota's music being made to this day. Nino Rota is best known for his many film scores\u2014in particular for the seminal Fellini films La Strada (1954), La Dolce Vita (1960), 8 1/2 (1963), Juliet of the Spirits (1965), and Amarcord (1974). He also wrote the scores for Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968), Luchino Visconti's The Leopard, and Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather Part II.  For Fellini alone, Rota produced almost 80 film scores starting with The White Sheik in 1952 and ending with the unfairly forgotten Orchestra Rehearsal in 1979, the year of the composer's death. Rota's film scores were a great commercial success.  The soundtrack album of Romeo and Juliet, with combined dialogue and music, reached number two and spent 74 weeks on the Billboard charts. The theme song for La Strada sold more than two million copies in Italy alone. The film scores won many awards. For example, the score for The Godfather was nominated for an Oscar, won a British Academy Film Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Grammy. Less well known is the fact that Rota was a prolific composer of chamber music, operas, and orchestral pieces. In all he produced four symphonies, twelve operas, five ballets, three piano concertos, three cello concertos, various choral works, and dozens of chamber works\u2014the best known being his Concerto for Strings."

A deluxe edition of Dream With Me, available exclusively from Target, featured four bonus tracks: \"Someday\", \"Mi Mancherai\", \"The Impossible Dream\" and \"A Time For Us\". Evancho performed nearly the same songs as those on the Dream With Me CD for her first solo concert televised special, which first aired in June 2011 on PBS stations (\"The Prayer\" was omitted, but \"Dark Waltz\" and \"Mi Mancherai\" were added). The program was part of the PBS Great Performances series, co-produced by SYCO/Columbia.  It was frequently rebroadcast during 2011, and by early August 2011, the special had been broadcast nearly 2,000 times. It became \"one of the most viewed specials in the 38-year-history of the Great Performances series [and] raised record amounts of money for PBS stations.\" The special continued to be shown into 2013. Evancho was the youngest solo artist ever to headline a special on the Great Performances series.  The concert was taped in April 2011 at the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida, and was co-hosted by David Foster, who played the piano in the orchestra for many of the selections, while Conrad Tao played piano and violin in some selections.  The performances are available as a CD/DVD titled Dream With Me In Concert. Allmusic noted: \"the concert version ... sounds nearly identical (outside of the waves of applause) to the studio album ... but the accompanying DVD, which features the heavily choreographed performance, as well as an extensive photo gallery and interviews with both Evancho and Foster, should provide enough eye and ear candy to appease fans of the gifted young vocalist until a proper follow-up appears. In July 2011, the singer began her first official tour across the United States, to promote the album. It consisted of a series of performances with symphony orchestras, beginning with the Sun Valley Orchestra on July 31, followed by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra on August 5, the Ravinia Festival Orchestra on August 7, the Omaha Symphony Orchestra on August 26, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra on August 31 and her hometown Pittsburgh Opera on October 16.  Conductor Antony Walker took the opportunity to introduce her fans (many of whom were newcomers to opera) to the Pittsburgh Opera's chorus and soloists, who performed several numbers from Verdi, Bizet and Puccini along with Evancho's repertoire.  Evancho made her New York City concert debut at Avery Fisher Hall with songs from the album on November 7, 2011.  Her last concert of the year was in Las Vegas with David Foster in Las Vegas on December 29. After presenting her concert in Japan in January 2012 with the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, Evancho resumed her U.S. \"Dream With Me\" tour later the same month in California.  She gave three more concerts in February, with the San Diego Symphony, in Los Angeles, and with Fresno Grand Opera's orchestra, and another three in March, in San Francisco, Sacramento, and West Valley City, Utah.  In June, she concluded the tour with performances in Alpharetta, Georgia and Newark, New Jersey."

However, every expectation for a talented child were blown away from the first track. ... [T]here is constant emotion from a truly talented voice.\" USA Today rated the album 2-1/2 stars out of four: \"[Evancho's] sweet, unblemished vocal tone and slow, careful vibrato hardly betray her young age. ... But Dream's predictable and often bombastic odes to love and faith can undermine the tween's most appealing quality: innocence. I'd have preferred a little less pomp and Puccini and more youthful wonder.\"  People magazine gave the album three out of four stars, comparing Evancho favorably with her duet partners Barbra Streisand and Susan Boyle. The reviewer for Kelowna Capital News in Canada called Evancho a \"massive talent [who] seems equally adept at operatic arias, pop songs and show tunes.\" A Yahoo! review commented, \"This new album ... is a comparative stunner\". In the US, the album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 161,000 copies. The only album ahead of it was Bad Meets Evil's EP Hell: The Sequel. Dream With Me debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart, spent 17 consecutive weeks in the number one position on Billboard's US Classical Albums chart, and was certified gold by the RIAA. The album remained on the Billboard 200 for 30 consecutive weeks and remained on the Classical Albums chart for 74 consecutive weeks.  The album also reached #5 in Canada, #4 in the UK (where it was later certified silver), #4 on the World Albums Top 40 chart, #8 in New Zealand, #15 in Ireland, #26 on the Mexican chart and #37 in Japan, where it remained on the charts for 16 weeks.  With Dream With Me, Evancho became the youngest artist ever to debut on the UK charts in the top 5. In November 2011, after the release of Evancho's new album, Heavenly Christmas, sales of Dream With Me increased, and the album climbed to number 55 on the Billboard 200.  In its 2011 year-end charts, Billboard ranked Dream With Me as the second-best selling Classical Album for the year (behind Evancho's O Holy Night) and as the number 45 album of 2011 in the U.S.  After Evancho's singing appearance on Dancing with the Stars on April 30, 2012, the album regained the #1 ranking on the Billboard Classical Albums chart and rejoined the Billboard 200 at #178 for the Billboard week dated May 19, 2012.  As of October 2012, the album had sold 682,000 copies.  Billboard ranked the album #5 on its 2012 year-end Classical Albums chart. The DVD, Dream With Me: In Concert, topped the \"Top Music Videos\" chart in two of its first four weeks, and Billboard ranked it the #21 best selling music video DVD of 2011.  It charted in Mexico at #75 and at #294 in Japan.  Billboard ranked Dream With Me In Concert the #16 music video album of 2012, and by December 2012, Dream With Me In Concert had been ranked on the Billboard.biz Top Music Video chart in more than 60 weeks. Dream With Me, the song \"To Believe\" and Foster's production of the album, are discussed in detail in the 2013 Ph.D. dissertation of Evancho's uncle, composer Matthew Evancho."

During an intimate show at The Sofitel's Stone Rose on 2 November 2010, the singer explained the meaning of the recording, \"I kind of lost myself. It's very personal. It's about being true to yourself. Don't lose yourself in any situation you're put in, and do the dew.\" She further explained to The Sun, \"This song saved my life musically. The day before I wrote this song I was ready to give up music. It's amazing how three-and-a-half minutes of melody and lyrics can change your life and I'm so happy that not only has it saved my life but it's saving other people's. That's why my debut album is called Who You Are.\" According to The Independent, \"Who You Are\" is the song that draws the most messages from fans on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.

        "content": "The official music video was released on Jessie J's official YouTube and Vevo channels on 29 September 2011. The clip was inspired by the one for Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor's \"Nothing Compares 2 U.\" The video was directed by Emil Nava. The video features Jessie J in front of the camera as if it was her mirror in a bedroom. She is wearing a grey top with a black sports bra underneath. An en suite is visible in the background. Various angles of her singing are used throughout, e.g. on the bath in the en suite, on the floor, on the bed, etc. A mirror can be seen above left of the bed. Jewellery at the end of the bed, and on a bed-side locker, amongst other places are shown. As Jessie J begins to sing the final bridge, water begins to drip in front of her face. As the water falls, she wipes a drop from under her eye, as if she was crying. The entire room begins to be rained on, and wind begins to blow. Jessie J is completely soaking wet. Lights on the wall, and the lamp on her locker begin to spark, and turn off. The wind moves the jewellery off the bed and locker, taking the lamp with it. The mirror on the wall shakes. The video ends as the rain dies down, while Jessie J remains looking in her mirror."

It's a pop song with an infectious chorus, but flirts with gorgeous shifts in rhythmic texture [that keep] the melody from becoming predictable.

I'm not sure which of the three of us came up with funfairs ... We [realized] a love affair was pretty much like going round and round and round on a carousel. And before we knew it the song just took shape. It was all there, the words, the tune, there was no stopping it. And Tony and Bobby [Elliott] wrapped it up in an exceptional arrangement.\" \"On a Carousel\" was the Hollies first A-side on which Graham Nash sang lead vocals, although only for the first few lines. It was the Hollies' second-last single to be released in the US by Imperial before the band switched to the Epic label. The song was a hit in the UK, peaking at #4 on the single charts, and in Canada it made #7 in the RPM Magazine charts. It was also a hit in the United States, peaking at #11 on the Billboard chart."

Production for the album took place following lead singer Ronnie Radke's departure from Escape the Fate in 2008. Recording took place in December 2010 and lasted until February 2011 at Paint it Black Studios in Orlando, Florida. Michael Baskette, who worked with Radke on Escape the Fate's Dying Is Your Latest Fashion, returned as the executive producer for the album, alongside former bandmate Omar Espinosa and others as additional composers and production aids in the studio. The Drug in Me Is You was released on July 25, 2011, in Europe and Japan, and on July 26, 2011, in the United States. The album charted at number 19 on the US Billboard 200, selling 18,000 copies in its first week in the United States. It also charted internationally on the national album charts in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. By December 2019, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Upon release, The Drug in Me Is You received mixed reviews. Critics consistently noted the contrast between hardcore music and pop music on the tracks, but to mixed reception. Overall, the lyrics were viewed as being clich\u00e9 while Radke's singing and return to making music were noted. In addition, critics focused on the bitter relationship between Radke and his former band, Escape the Fate, in which reviewers noticed the choice to attack the band in many of the album's tracks. The Drug in Me Is You was chosen by the Guitar World magazine as the album number 21 among the top 50 albums of 2011. It is the only album that features founding bassist Nason Schoeffler and drummer Scott Gee."

        "content": "In 2006, Ronnie Radke was involved in an altercation in Las Vegas that resulted in the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Cook, eventually leading to Radke's two-year imprisonment for parole violation. Following his incarceration and forced departure from his old band, Escape the Fate, Radke formed Falling in Reverse with the help of longtime friend Nason Schoeffler, who found band members and visited Radke while he was in prison. However, Radke was unable to work with the band prior to his release on December 12, 2010. After going through a few bassists and drummers, the band prepared to record their full-length debut album. After the album finished production, bassist and founding member Nason Schoeffler and drummer Scott Gee left the band, making the album their only release with the band. Former Aiden, I Am Ghost, and The Bigger Lights drummer Ryan Seaman replaced Scott Gee and former Cellador member Mika Horiuchi took over bass for Schoeffler. Originally conceived as a double album, the band's debut was originally going to contain one disc of post-hardcore and another with pop punk. This was eventually scrapped in favor for a single album, soon confirmed to be titled, The Drug in Me Is You. The band also confirmed that Radke's friend, Michael Baskette, who had previously worked on Blessthefall's album Witness and Escape the Fate's debut Dying Is Your Latest Fashion (which was also with Radke), would produce the album. Radke announced that the album would be released in 2011 by Epitaph Records, Radke's former label with Escape the Fate. The album was slated for a July 26, 2011 release date, with pre-orders scheduled for June 7."

        "content": "In December 2010, the band began composing songs together for the first time. They announced on December 20 that they would go to Orlando, Florida to record a full-length debut album over a period of two months with a tentative release date of the first quarter of 2011.  The eleven song track list was released soon after. With the help of Executive Producer Michael \"Elvis\" Baskette, mixing and tracking for the album concluded on April 2, 2011. Speaking about working with Baskette as producer, Radke said, \"The dude\u2019s a genius, he really is. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s under the radar or anything, but the guy knows what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s a vocalist guy. That\u2019s why me and him get along so well.\" The Drug in Me Is You has been described as post-hardcore and pop punk. The songs also included synths, pop-choruses, and other sounds. Radke commented on the inclusion of different genres in songs, comparing different parts of the same song to the sounds of Norma Jean, Underoath, and Katy Perry. Lyrically, according to Radke, some of the songs on the album had tones of being arrogant, comparing the attitude to that commonly found in rap music. This is because Radke has cited Eminem as one of his major influences, so much so that he even included a beat made by Eminem and Dr. Dre during a breakdown on the track \"Sink or Swim\". In an interview, Radke's experiences were compared to Eminem's, noting that, \"[Eminem] is someone who has been knocked down and knocked down, and he\u2019s gotten back up again. Time and time again. And he\u2019s triumphed.\" While the album itself was written during Radke's time in prison, he does not consider it a \"Jailhouse record\", though some songs that did not make the album do address a prison theme. The lyrics for the album were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. He has often called the album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, \"I would think all day, for days and days, [about] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in different ways. I don\u2019t know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it.\" Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is You, came from Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, \"We named it that because ... It's me, looking in the mirror, saying, 'I am my own worst [enemy]. I do the worst damage to myself \u2014 more than anybody else can to do me.'\" Some things explored in the album were Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, the corruption of Las Vegas, and his incarceration in prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related to the death of Michael Cook. Radke stated that he chose not to write any songs about love because, \"...I'm not going to lie ... and try to write songs on how much I love somebody. I do have love, but there will be a lot of songs about just what I\u2019ve been through.\" Several songs focused on his departure from Escape the Fate after they kicked him out and replaced him with former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt, with songs on the album that directly attacked both Mabbitt and Escape the Fate bassist Max Green. Prior to the album's release, Radke discussed what he intended to say about Escape the Fate on certain tracks, stating in an interview that he believed that the band's first album without Radke, This War Is Ours, was named after the conflict over Mabbitt taking over Radke's position in Escape the Fate. The band has since claimed it was not written about Radke, but he did not believe them."

These shows were planned to be with supporting act Vampires Everywhere. However, the July dates were postponed due to issues with guitarist Jacky Vincent's immigration visa, though the band voiced intentions to make these dates up. This meant that the band's first live performances would be at the Vans Warped Tour 2011 from August 10 to 14 for five shows on the Advent Clothing Stage throughout the western United States. However, the band played a few secret shows under the name \"Goodbye Graceful\" on August eighth and ninth in Anaheim and Los Angeles. Following the release of the album and some Warped Tour 2011 appearances, the band announced their first headlining tour across the United States, with locations beginning in New Mexico, looping around the east coast, and concluding in Colorado. The tour will begin on September 18 and end on October 11, 2011, with support acts Eyes Set to Kill and For All Those Sleeping. The band's first supporting tour was to be a ten-show tour in November 2011 with headliners Black Veil Brides and supporting acts Aiden and Drive-A, but was canceled after Black Veil Brides dropped out when their lead vocalist Andy Biersack broke his nose. Emmure replaced Falling in Reverse on the second half of the Take A Picture, It Lasts Longer Tour with We Came As Romans and the band played an exclusive show at KROQ on November 8 to make up for the canceled shows. The first single for the album, as well the band's first single overall, \"Raised by Wolves\", was released on June 10, 2011, to iTunes, though it had leaked a few weeks earlier on May 29. The track was featured on the iTunes Music Store as the \"single of the week\", and was available as a free download for that week. On June 21, the band released a 33-second preview of their second single, the eponymous track \"The Drug in Me Is You\". The full single was released three days later. The band's first music video was released for the track on June 28, and was advertised by The New York Post the week before the album's release. The album was streamed in its entirety by the band on their official website on July 15. The Drug in Me Is You was released commercially in the United States on July 26, 2011, and was promoted alongside other albums released that week including: Wu-Tang Clan's Legendary Weapons, Katherine Jenkins' From the Heart, All Shall Perish's This is Where It Ends, and others. The album's third single, \"I'm Not a Vampire\", was released on October 24 with an accompanying music video which features a satirical Celebrity Rehab theme, featuring Jeffree Star. On June 18, they released their fourth single, \"Good Girls, Bad Guys\" with an accompanying music video. Their fifth single, \"Pick Up the Phone\" was released on October 15, 2012, along with an iPhone 5 giveaway. In celebration of the album becoming certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), pre-order for the vinyl edition of the album was announced, which features two previously unreleased songs titled \"You're Something Else\" and \"I'm Not a Hero\". The vinyl edition was released on January 17, 2020. A reimagined version of the song, \"The Drug in Me Is You\", was also released on February 13, 2020, in celebration of the album's gold certification and as a gift to fans of Falling in Reverse. In celebration of the album's 10th anniversary, Falling in Reverse released new The Drug in Me Is You merch for sale on their official website starting July 26, 2021."

Alison Kopki of The Aquarian Weekly called the album, a \"fun listen and decent starting-off point\", and it \"lets Radke get some things off his chest\". The track-by-track breakdown noted the songs having \"fast guitars, heavy drums and shred guitar solos\". Kenneth E. Oquist of Arts and Entertainment Playground gave the album a four out of a possible five score overall. Oquist noted the mix of pop and hardcore, stating, \"Hardcore and pop crashed together to become hardcore pop...  Much like Nine Inch Nails created the genre industrial rock, Falling in Reverse has created a unique sound...\" He gave a track-by-track review of the album, particularly emphasizing \"Raised by Wolves\", \"I'm Not a Vampire\", and \"Caught Like a Fly\". Things pointed out included: Michael Baskette's production, the band's instrumentation, and Radke's melodies. The writer noted the repeated attacks at Escape the Fate but disliked the album's lyrical quality. The resulting score was an 8.9 out of 10 possible, with the tracks \"I'm Not a Vampire\", \"Good Girls Bad Guys\", \"Pick Up the Phone\", all pop tracks, being pointed out as particularly good. A Weekender correspondent noted that the album includes: \"Aggressive rock... metal and electronica into this collective mix of mayhem and definitely keeps listeners wondering what will come next.\" Different parts of songs were complimented, such as the \"immense hooks... catchy choruses... [and] vicious breakdowns\", as well as Radke's lyrics being called \"witty and poetic\". The correspondent's review further states, \"Radke has managed to imprint his dramatic personality into every aspect of 'The Drug In Me Is You.'\" Conversely, AllMusic contributor Gregory Heaney gave the album an overall score of three out of a possible five, noting that the lyrics \"feel more genuinely personal than his earlier work\", and that \"there's a real sense of urgent catharsis at work\". He concludes, \"[The] combination of a tight, talented band and a tortured frontman doesn't necessarily make Falling in Reverse a revelatory band, but is does make The Drug in Me Is You a very solid album.\" Molly Walter of The University Leader felt the album was an attempt to recreate Escape the Fate prior to Radke's departure and noted that \"he fell short big time\", calling the album's music \"out of date and overdone\". Walter did comment on Radke's singing but felt the lyrical content was conceited, concluding the review saying, \"Face it, Ronnie, you did not magically turn tragedy into melody. You\u2019re just not king of the music scene.\" The Jam! gives 3.5/5 stars to The Drug in Me Is You and said, \"In a world of poseurs, Ronnie Radke is the real deal. The lewd, crude and tattooed punk has survived jail, rehab and being turfed from Escape the Fate. Now he\u2019s on the loose and up to no good with a new band \u2014 and a CD of post-hardcore anthems that render his foul-mouthed tales of sex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll with a mix of metalcore power and pop-punk melody. Lock up everything.\" Metalholic said \"'I'm back...' I can't think of a more appropriate way to flow into the second track 'Tragic Magic.' Ronnie Radke is most definitely back and he is not afraid to tell you so. This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke's former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song. The third track 'The Drug in Me is You' was the second single and the band's first video and might I add a very entertaining video. 'The Drug in Me is You,' is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. 'Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I'm so high on misery can't you see,' evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. \"If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what\u2019s the point of living life if life just contradicts? Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. I got all profound there for a second, it happens.\""

The album ended up selling 18,120 copies in its first week in the United States, charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200.

In its second week on sales, The Drug in Me is You dropped about 70% in the United States, selling 5,870 copies. This dropped the album 60 spots to number 79 on the Billboard 200, and brought total US sales for the album to around 24,000 copies.

        "content": "Lennon completed \"I'm Losing You\" in 1980 while in Bermuda after trying to call wife Yoko Ono but not being able to get through. His annoyance became a jumping off point for a deeper examination of the state of his marriage. The lyrics acknowledge that the relationship is in trouble, and Lennon admits that he has hurt his wife, but he also resents the fact that she won't let him live down his mistakes. He also claims that those mistakes occurred long ago. According to pop historian Robert Rodriguez, the candidness of Lennon's exploration of his feelings give the song a potency that recalls songs from John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Walls and Bridges. Music critic Johnny Rogan also sees similarities with songs written during his mid-70s separation from Yoko Ono, when many the Walls and Bridges songs were written. And Lennon has confirmed that although the song was originally inspired by his feelings over the phone call, it also expresses his feelings about losing Yoko Ono during their 18-month separation (i.e., his lost weekend) as well as other losses, including the loss of his mother, which was the subject of several songs on John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The opening line in the song has the singer wondering why he went to the room of a \"stranger\" for comfort. It is left ambiguous whether the stranger is someone other than his lover, or whether the stranger is actually his lover, to whom he has become so alienated that she seems like a stranger. In another line, \"do you still have to carry that cross?\", the singer uses The Passion as a metaphor for his lover's refusal to forgive him. Another line from the song is \"here in the valley of indecision/I don't know what to do\". This is a reference to the title of the 1945 movie The Valley of Decision. Shortly after writing the song, Lennon explained to son Sean that he was often indecisive as a result of the pain he suffered when having to choose which parent to live with when his parents separated. Authors Ken Bielen and Ben Urish say that the \"big\" drum sound and guitar part help create a \"tense atmosphere\", and liken the drum sound to production styles that became common later in the decade. An earlier version of the song was entitled \"Stranger's Room\". According to rock journalist Paul Du Noyer, \"Stranger's Room\" was written in 1978."

        "content": "Lennon recorded an early demo version of \"I'm Losing You\" in July 1980. This version, part of which appeared on The Lost Lennon Tapes, was played on acoustic guitar with a drum machine, and Lennon overdubbed additional guitar and vocal parts. Producer Jack Douglas originally suggested that Lennon use Cheap Trick as the backing band to play on the song. A version was recorded on 12 August 1980 with Cheap Trick's guitarist Rick Nielsen and drummer Bun E. Carlos backing Lennon.  They also recorded a version of Yoko Ono's \"I'm Moving On\", which is a companion piece to \"I'm Losing You\". Lennon was impressed enough with their performance that Lennon told Carlos that he wished Nielsen had been his 2nd guitarist for \"Cold Turkey\", but ultimately this version was not included on Double Fantasy (nor was the Cheap Trick-backed version of \"I'm Moving On\".) Possible reasons for their exclusions are that Cheap Trick's management may have wanted too much money, or that Lennon believed that the performances were more \"heavy\" than he wanted. However, when the Double Fantasy version of \"I'm Losing You\" was recorded, the version with Cheap Trick's backing was played through the session musicians' headphones to help inspire their performances. The Cheap Trick version was eventually released on John Lennon Anthology, albeit without an overdubbed guitar part played by Nielsen. \"I'm Losing You\" was first recorded with the Double Fantasy session musicians on 18 August 1980, but Lennon was dissatisfied with this performance, and thus a third recording was made on 26 August, which was released on Double Fantasy. A horn arrangement was overdubbed on 5 September, but this was ultimately deleted from the released version of the song. Lennon's vocal was recorded on 22 September."

        "content": "At one point, \"I'm Losing You\" was planned as a single, but after Lennon's murder it was shelved as being \"eerily inappropriate\". Nonetheless, what appears to be a single edit was made, fading the Double Fantasy version early to avoid the crossfade to \"I'm Moving On\", and which appears to have been used for the compilation albums The John Lennon Collection and Lennon. Stickers on the Double Fantasy record album emphasised the inclusion of \"I'm Losing You\". In 1998, Capitol Records issued \"I'm Losing You\" as part of a two-track promotional CD, backed with Lennon's recording of \"Only You\", to promote the John Lennon Anthology album. The CD was issued catalogue number LENNON 001. A promotional film was also made for this version, with Nielsen, Carlos and Levin miming their performances. The film incorporated animations of drawings Lennon had made. Rogan considers \"I'm Losing You\" to be one of the best songs on Double Fantasy. Author Scott Walker calls \"I'm Losing You\" Lennon's \"best composition of 1980\". Rock journalist Paul Du Noyer considers \"I'm Losing You\" to be proof \"that Double Fantasy is a work of greater emotional complexity than many of its critics are prepared to admit\", and gives lie to the notion that Lennon and Ono used the album to \"paint a falsely benign portrait of their marriage\". Authors Ken Bielen and Ben Urish call \"I'm Losing You\" the \"toughest\" song on Double Fantasy. However, they lament that it could have been even tougher had the Cheap Trick version been used. Of the Cheap Trick version released on Anthology they claim that \"the take is quite good, and without the production gloss of the album, it roars without sounding incomplete, making it an obvious highlight of the 1998 collection\"."

In his review for Pitchfork, Hank Shteamer observed \"it isn't just the best band Miles ever led, but one of the choicest small groups in jazz history... At its heart, jazz thrives on bold, sensitive interaction in the moment, and Live in Europe 1967 represents the pinnacle of that practice.\". PopMatters', Matthew Flander gave the album 10 out of 10 saying \"no matter how many releases we get from the Davis archives, no matter how familiar you are with his mid-\u201860s work, Live in Europe 1967 will surprise you and remind you that, even in lean times, even when the trends of the genre he championed were moving away from him, even when his country stopped caring, Miles Davis found a way to press forward, to reinvent, and to give us yet another classic sound, and perhaps the final thrilling word on Jazz as he knew it\""

        "doc_id": "175_112830",
        "title": "Tabeer (album)_Composition and songwriting",
        "content": "Ali worked on developing tracks for Tabeer for a period of about ten months and mentioned: \"I like to compose using ragas because that is my base and my foundation.\" Referring to his songwriting process for the album, he noted: \"the music I make doesn't have rock tones anymore. I like sounds that relate to humanity, like Sufi music.\" Accordingly, several songs in the album have noticeably spiritual and devotional overtones. Khaireyan De Naal was the lead single and opening track on Tabeer and was used heavily to promote the album across music channels in both India and Pakistan. Ali borrowed the primary chorus line of the song from Tufail Niazi's folk song of the same name and wrote and composed the song around it. The song tells the story of the tragic romance of Heer Ranjha, a Punjabi folktale written in 1766 by the poet Waris Shah. Ali received significant critical acclaim for Khaireyan De Naal and has mentioned that it is his favorite track in the album. He also composed and sang a version of this song for the soundtrack of the 2015 Hindi movie, Tevar. The album has strong Sufi overtones and features three noteworthy Sufi tracks \u2013 Rang Le, Bulleh Shah, and Dum Ali Ali Dum. Rang Le is based on the well-known Sufi devotional song, Mohe Apne Hi Rang Mein Rang De, written by Sufi poet Amir Khusrau as a supplication to his spiritual guide \u2014 the Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya \u2014 beseeching him to dye Khusrau in the colors of divine love. The theme of immersive colors, dyes, and hues is a prominent motif in Sufi poetry and imagery and symbolizes union and oneness between the seeker and God (as the Beloved). Ali incorporated guitar- and accordion-led jazz improvisations into his arrangement of this track to lend it softer, romantic tones. The song Bulleh Shah is based on the Sufi devotional Kafi Aao Saiyo Ral Deo Ni Wadhai written by the 18th-century poet and philosopher, Bulleh Shah, in which he celebrates the ecstasy of finding his murshid (spiritual teacher) \u2013 the Sufi saint Shah Inayat Qadiri. Ali chose to name the song eponymously in honor of its writer. He also performed a version of this song for Season 2 of MTV Unplugged in 2012. Ali composed and wrote additional lyrics for the track Dum Ali Ali Dum which is a variation of the popular 600-year-old qawwali, Dama Dam Mast Qalandar, originally written by Amir Khusrau and modified further by Bulleh Shah. The song is a much-celebrated and widely-sung tribute to the Sufi mystic and saint Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and is part of the Indian subcontinent's cultural zeitgeist. Rohi is a Kafi originally sung by Zahida Parveen. The original song is in a little-known dialect from a remote region of Pakistan, so Ali altered some of the lyrics to make the song easier to understand. He also modified the composition of the original song to render it in a more contemporary style while retaining the traditional sounds of the original. Pagalpan is inspired by Sindhi folk music and plays with the familiar Sufi theme of seeking a path to God and enlightenment while also acknowledging that God is within oneself. The song Kartar, set in raga Darbari, is based on a time-honored Patiala Gharana bandish, originally sung by Ali's father Ustad Amanat Ali Khan and uncle Ustad Bade Fateh Ali Khan. Ali described the track as an \"old traditional family song\" and has shared that he extended the sthayi of the original bandish to develop it into a song. In 2009, Ali delivered a live performance of Ajab Khail \u2014 a modified rendition of Kartar \u2014 for Season 2 of Coke Studio Pakistan, produced by Rohail Hyatt. Kartar is particularly noted for its rock riffs and high-octane orchestration, and it was featured again as a bonus track in Ali's second solo album, Kyun Dooriyan (2010), with a slightly different arrangement."

Described by The Orlando Sentinel writer Thom Duffy as \"a bit of Texas swing that features a shuffling beat and a fiddle crying like the horn of a passing freight train\", the song is about the narrator's pursuit of a cowgirl whom he wants to marry."

        "content": "Starr had considered calling the album Motel California, then Another #9, and finally Wings, before settling on Ringo 2012. The album was recorded in Los Angeles, and mixed in England, produced by Starr and Bruce Sugar. The title is a reference to Starr's most successful solo album, Ringo, which was released in 1973. At less than 29 minutes in length, it was his shortest album to date. Ringo 2012 includes new recordings of two songs that Starr had issued on previous albums: \"Step Lightly\", from Ringo, and \"Wings\", from 1977's Ringo the 4th. His cover of Buddy Holly's \"Think It Over\" was released on the Listen to Me: Buddy Holly tribute album before its appearance on Ringo 2012. The new version of \"Wings\" was released as a single a few weeks in advance of the album. The inclusion of the track \"In Liverpool\" meant that Ringo 2012 was Starr's third consecutive album to include a song about Liverpool, his hometown. Asked why this was, he told Alan Light of Newsweek: \"I came to the conclusion a while ago that I do not want to write an autobiography, because all anybody wants is those eight years from 1962 to 1970, and I would have ten volumes before we got there. So I thought I'll do it in song, and do vignettes of certain aspects of my life.\" The cover photograph and as well as other photographs within the album's artwork were taken by rock photographer Rob Shanahan, who had worked closely with Starr for seven years."

        "content": "Eat Me in St. Louis saw It Bites move away from the progressive rock and pop influences of their two previous albums and towards a more hard rock sound with more straightforward compositions and a heavier, rawer sound. The album was recorded in Munich and produced by Reinhold Mack, best known for his work with Queen. The band enlisted Roger Dean (the record sleeve artist famous for his fantasy-based cover art on Yes albums) to produce the artwork for Eat Me in St. Louis. The album yielded three singles - \"Still Too Young to Remember\", \"Underneath Your Pillow\" and \"Sister Sarah\". The first two of these were also re-released as remixed versions. None of the singles were significant hits, though all five made it into the UK charts, with the remixed versions performing slightly better than the originals. This was the only It Bites album to feature the Tapboard, a tap-style guitar instrument developed by lead singer/guitarist Francis Dunnery and Dave Farmilow. Dunnery used the Tapboard on the coda to \"Leaving Without You\" and on the album's concluding instrumental, \"Charlie\" (which did not appear on the LP release). Early CD copies of the album came with a bonus 3-inch CD single which featured three extra tracks: \"Having a Good Day\", \"Reprise\" and \"Bullet in the Barrel\". The first two of these tracks showcased the Tapboard (\"Having a Good Day\" featured it in a band context, and \"Reprise\" in a fast minimalist instrumental played predominantly by Dunnery). Eat Me in St. Louis was the final studio album by the original lineup of It Bites, as Francis Dunnery left the band the following year. Although It Bites recruited a new singer, Lee Knott, and continued for a further year (with erstwhile keyboard player John Beck now playing guitar) the band changed both its direction and its name (first to Navajo Kiss and then to Sister Sarah) and did not record any further material. The band would not record again until reuniting in 2006 with a new lead singer and guitarist, John Mitchell."

It is Lucassen's first solo album since 1993's Pools of Sorrow, Waves of Joy, released 18 years earlier under the name Anthony, before he reached fame with his progressive metal/rock opera project Ayreon. Lucassen wrote all the songs, sings lead vocals and performs most instruments himself, including all guitars, bass and keyboards. As with Ayreon, it is a concept album. It follows the story of Mr. L (voiced by Lucassen), a modern-day man revived in a distant future where everything has changed. Although the story is not a part of the Ayreon storyline, it is set within the same fictional universe: the character of Mr. L had previously appeared in the song \"The Truth is in Here\" from 01011001, while the cover art includes the Dream Sequencer from the Ayreon album Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer. The album also prominently features spoken vocals performed by actor Rutger Hauer as Mr. L's appointed psychological advisor, Voight-Kampff, in reference to the eponymous fictional polygraph-like device in Blade Runner, in which Hauer starred. Music videos were released for \"Pink Beatles in a Purple Zeppelin\" and \"E-police\". Lucassen also released a music video for \"Lost in the New Real\", which also acts practically as an introduction to the album."

Due to The Theory of Everything being a fresh start for Ayreon, Lost in the New Real was the last Lucassen album to take place in the fictional universe and storyline originating from The Final Experiment in 1995, until the release of The Source in 2017, which acts as a prequel to the storyline. The cover art features the Dream Sequencer, a device previously featured in three Ayreon albums, here appearing identical to the cover of Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer Mr. L already appeared in the Ayreon song \"The Truth Is in Here\" from 01011001, where he was also voiced by Lucassen. The song was set in present day, presumably before the events of Lost in the New Real. In \"The Truth Is in Here\", Mr. L was referring to several Ayreon stories, including the stories of The Final Experiment, Into the Electric Castle and The Human Equation. In the booklet, \"Our Imperfect Race\" explains that \"In their ongoing search for extraterrestrial intelligence, SETI finally has detected a signal that could be some sort of binary code. Is it an alien life form trying to contact us, or just a freak coincidence?\". This is a reference to 01011001, where The Forever, a fictional race featured in several Ayreon albums, sends a distress signal under the form of a binary code."

It is an uptempo pop rock song, which runs for a duration of two minutes and 46 seconds. It was produced by Gessle alongside Christoffer Lundquist and Clarence \u00d6fwerman. According to Ultimate Guitar, the song has a tempo of 170 beats per minute. Each verse is composed of four repetitions of a G\u2013D\u2013C sequence, followed by a chorus consisting of two repetitions of Em\u2013C\u2013G\u2013D, while the bridge is made up of three progressions of Am\u2013C\u2013Em\u2013D. Chris Roberts from BBC Music described the song as a \"sonic sibling to Joan Jett's 'I Love Rock 'n' Roll', only even bigger, louder and dumber\", and said it was indicative of the quality of the album, which he said was \"loaded with punchy, hook-riddled anthems that can only be described as absolute belters.\" The song features a distinctive introduction, performed on a mouth harp. Gessle described it as an obvious album opener, and said: \"We needed a cool intro, and we had fun thinking about what [we could use]. We joked about having the sound of a cat giving birth, or a dying cat, or something stupid like that. Then someone suggested a mouth harp. It sounded really weird, so we went with that. It felt like a nice comeback for Roxette: the first sound you hear from us after ten years is a mouth harp.\""

The LP marked a change in the hard rock sound from the singer's previous albums Suzi Quatro and Quatro, instead displaying a more funk-oriented rock sound. The title track reached No. 31 on the UK singles chart in February 1975. The album's second single, \"I Bit off More Than I Could Chew\", also reached the charts, peaking at 54 in the UK charts. \"Michael\" also had limited promotion, being released as a single in some territories, including Australia where the song reached the top 100. The album reached the charts in several territories, reaching the top 50 in Germany, Norway and New Zealand, as well as making an appearance in the US charts, peaking at 146. The album includes a cover of Little Willie John's \"Fever\". This was the last LP to include Alistair Mackenzie as keyboard player, with Mike Deacon replacing him thereafter. In 2012, the album was re-issued and digitally remastered by 7T's Records in the UK, along with her other studio releases. This particular re-issue contains bonus tracks and some rare pictures."

It was released on April 16, 2012, through Interscope Records, as the lead single from the album. The song was written by Furtado in a collaboration with its producer Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins. \"Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)\" is an R&B song influenced by hip hop collective Odd Future and 1990s productions. The track's lyrics refer to the singer's life as a teenager, describing her passion for hip hop and R&B music at that time. \"Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, who praised the song's breakdown but criticized Furtado's vocals. The song achieved moderate commercial success, reaching the top 30 in Belgium, Canada, The Netherlands and United Kingdom. In the United States, \"Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)\" failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100; however, it charted within the top 40 on Pop Songs and reached the top 10 on Hot Dance Club Songs. The accompanying music video was directed by  Little X, and features Furtado strutting down a city block wearing a giant pair of stilts, as she is joined by Native American dancers throughout the video. To promote the song, Furtado performed it on Alan Carr: Chatty Man, at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards and the 2012 MuchMusic Video Awards. In 2021, \"Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)\" was interpolated in the dance track \"Talk About\" by Rain Radio and DJ Craig Gorman, which reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry."

The singer stated that the song's instrumentation was influenced by the 1990s hip hop and R&B as a tribute to the music she listened to in her teenage years, also citing inspiration from hip hop group Odd Future's \"dark sound[ing], heavy and visceral\" sound as she tried to recreate a similar style on \"Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)\". The lyrics of \"Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)\" also concern Furtado's teenage period, with the singer describing the song's lyrical content as \"my swagger-in-spades, rhyme-writing 14-year-old self find[ing] liberation through hip hop and R&B attending 'music jams' in suburban Victoria\". There are references to Furtado's favourite groups at the period  such as Salt-n-Pepa, A Tribe Called Quest and Blackstreet, many of whom were produced by Jerkins himself  and her teenage wardrobe. The song's title references the hoop earrings she liked to wear. Furtado said that the song describes \"a certain unique swagger you have at that young age and that the music gives you,\" and that she was \"the kid who used to pick up the mic at parties and just rock the crowd, sing my way through the storm and know my voice could penetrate.\" The singer stated that as \"hip-hop was super-exotic to us in Canada\", she felt that \"it was very liberating, finding that confidence through the music\"."

Furtado's manager Chris Smith stated that \"Big Hoops\" was an attempt to translate Furtado's versatility as \"a free-range artist\", being \"free form; not contained versus a structured typical song.\" As an in-joke to Smith's reaction to when he first heard the track, the song starts with the manager saying \"Time release the fresh\", Furtado laughing at the phrase, and Interscope Records A&R representative Thom Panunzio replying \"You're 100 percent right Chris.\" The title and intro, during which Furtado chants \"the bigger the better\" against a bass line, references the character finding strength in the size of her earrings."

Eventually it became the lead single for The Spirit Indestructible. Furtado stated that the song earned this status because it represented her intentions \"to detach myself from all shackles and play freely\" as her ambitious younger self was always \"pushing the boundaries\".

Robbie Daw of Idolator, gave the song a mixed review, criticizing the singer's \"unnecessary Rihanna-esque vocal delivery\" while adding that it \"isn't the strongest lead single we've heard from an album.\" Jessica Sager of Pop Crush rated it 0.5 out of 5 stars, comparing Furtado's vocals to the ones of a \"child wailing through a cardboard tube.\" She also wrote that \"Sager also noted that the singer \"wants to depart from Loose as well, but she doesn't have anything to say beyond getting dressed and having a guy ignore her\" and concluded that \"the song is more irritating than catchy, and the beat isn't strong enough to make many people dance.\" Melinda Newman of HitFix deemed the song \"It's a meaningless little ditty that is all about the military beat and bragging rights. It doesn't have enough of a hook to work its way up the radio charts, but will likely do very well in the clubs.\""

However, \"Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)\" reached the top 40 of the Pop Songs chart and the top 10 of the Hot Dance Club Songs chart.

Then we\u2019d come back together and try to combine what we\u2019d been doing. We recorded everything. We all had handheld recorders with us. Then we\u2019d go through the stuff and pick out things that seemed promising, like we might pick out one interesting rhythm and then try to build a melody around it. We might take a section of one jam and try to build a song around it. Everything was labeled \u2014 all the recordings \u2014 and I think there were 13 or 14 hours of just stuff like that from the first week or so. Much of it wasn\u2019t worth keeping, but out of that material, the new stuff was kind of born.\" Almost four years after the album's release, Weitz intimated: \"Coming back for Centipede Hz was difficult. It was a super emotional time. Because of the way we set the making of that album up, taking us all to Baltimore, the unsettled nature came out on the record. It was just a very different process from the more easy going one that Merriweather had been. ... we wrote it for the stage and, before recording ... some of us got set ideas about what songs should sound like and where certain parts should fit in. Then, when we went to ooze all four of those different perspectives together\u2014there weren\u2019t battles, but it did lead to a lot of things staying in the mix.\""

Ben Allen, who co-produced the group's previous album Merriweather Post Pavilion, returned as the co-producer. In an interview with Pitchfork Media, Avey Tare called Centipede Hz \"more grounded in one location\" and less ambient than the group's previous album. The group also wanted the album to have a \"live-band feel\" to it. In turn, live instruments were used such as a sit-down drum kit and live keyboards. Centipede Hz also featured the first Animal Collective song where Deakin sang lead vocals, on \"Wide Eyed.\""

        "title": "Centipede Hz_Musical style and influences",
        "content": "Where Merriweather Post Pavilion had more of a pop sound, Centipede Hz was a return to Animal Collective's experimental roots. Writers have cited a wide variety of influences on Centipede Hz, including psychedelic rock, garage rock, Chicha music and avant-garde music. For specific bands, writers have cited, among others, Pink Floyd, Portishead, We the People, Milton Nascimento and Z\u00e9 Ramalho as influences. Centipede Hz displays a large amount of abrasive vocal styles, mostly from Avey Tare. As Merriweather Post Pavilion showed more of an ambient side to Animal Collective, Centipede Hz features more samples and live instrumentation. Radio commercials and station identification announcements were additional influences on the album's sound. This influence is reflected in the album's use of radio interference and white noise. Animal Collective got the idea for using radio interference while re-writing the songs on Centipede Hz for a live performance at the 2011 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The group wanted a continuous sound when playing the Centipede Hz songs live, thus they used radio interference to do so. Avey Tare noted, \"My brother was a DJ when I was growing up, and there was a radio station called B104 in Baltimore. He had recently got a CD of all the radio identifications that come between [songs], and we were going back through everything, listening to how weird and spacey and experimental it sounded. When you add that element to radio, it's this weird form of musique concr\u00e8te. We thought it would be cool and also a little funny to have something like [sings like a radio segue] \"more continuous music\" in our live set, just because that's our style of playing.\""

On Metacritic, the album has a score of 75 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Barry Nicolson of NME called the album \"a flawed and imperfect jumble of garish colours and disconnected sensations,\" but nevertheless gave the album a positive review, concluding: \"It\u2019s chaotic and confounding. It will frustrate as much as it delights. And no, not everything they throw at the wall manages to stick. But my, what a lovely mess they\u2019ve made.\" BBC Music's Mike Diver gave the album a positive review, writing \"submit fully to Centipede Hz and it will infect you, quite deliciously, for the foreseeable.\" Rolling Stones Jon Dolan gave the album a score 3 and a half stars out of five, writing \"What gives Centipede Hz its relatable gravity is that, this time out, Animal Collective sound more like creatures who put their skinny jeans on one hoof at a time [...] For a band that usually seems to be eternally shambling toward transcendence, a shot of ambivalence is a brave new kind of pick-me-up.\" Much of the criticism of the album was directed at the album's dense sound. Pitchforks Stuart Berman, while giving the album a positive review, criticized the songs for being too cluttered compared to those on previous albums, writing: \"Centipede Hz, by comparison, feels like someone throwing a burrito on your windshield: The songs hit with a jolt, instantly splaying all their ingredients before you.\" Commenting on the return of Deakin, Tom Ewing of The Guardian wrote: \"It explains some of the record's bluntness \u2013 every track is full of incident, and most incidents are mixed to a similar level, so at first the songs hit you as unresolved slabs of babble.\" Ewing continued: \"This makes Centipede Hz a tough listening experience to begin with, but not a particularly weird one. Once you adjust to the new method and peer through the layers of detail and clustered production, these are often quite conventional \u2013 if meandering \u2013 indie-rock songs.\" The A.V. Clubs Marc Hirsh, while praising the songs \"Pulleys\" and \"Wide Eyed,\" wrote \"[...] [O]ther songs are so densely packed with sonic information that they become nearly impenetrable [...]\" Hirsh concluded: \"Animal Collective runs riot on the head front so thoroughly that it overlooks its own eagerness to please. Instead, Centipede Hz insists that listeners think their way to liking it.\""

Even if you decide that there isn\u2019t a single song you can use in your church, you want this album because you will enjoy this album...It is a breath of fresh air in a worship culture that often finds itself pigeonholed into one sound.\" Allmusic's Jon O'Brien said that album \"could well be the record that truly transcends the scene's core audience. Indeed, it's a spiritual album that doesn't necessarily have to be for spiritual people, thanks to a warm, rich, and inviting acoustic sound\". O'Brien went onto write \"whether you choose to listen to it as a celebratory worship experience or just a conventional pop/rock album, Homemade Worship by Handmade People works on both levels.\" Alpha Omega News' Rob Snyder graded the album an A, and said \"a excellent release of original praise and worship music that was recorded in Irish church halls and homes in the band\u2019s organic, collective style.  What I find refreshing about this group is that they don\u2019t believe in being in the limelight.\" At CCM Magazine, Andrew Greer said the album is \"ripe with rich theology and authentic melodies\". Greer wrote that the album \"is a fresh, singable take on modern worship.\" CHRISTCORE's Sara Napier said that is \"an album bursting with infectious rhythm, heartfelt lyrics, talent, passion and thought-provoking titles, I don\u2019t see how anyone could pass this one up.\" Christian Manifesto's Lydia Akinola wrote \"the music is refreshingly free of overproduction and overworking.\" Christina Music Zine's David Huey said the album is \"powerful, positive, and on top of that, actually listenable.\" At Christianity Today, Robert Ham said that album contains some \"stomping, rollicking music.\" Cross Rhythms' Elliot Rose said that Rend Collective Experiment \"have clearly found their niche, a unique and distinctive sound - an experiment with exceptional results\" with respect to this album. Indie Vision Music's Jonathan Andre said \"listening to the album through, I can boldly claim Rend Collective Experiment will assert themselves in the CCM industry, with refreshing sounds and musical uniqueness that places this album as one of the most underrated albums of 2012 so far!\" Andre wrote \"Rend Collective Experiment have served up 11 tracks of pure worshipful moments where the listener is lost in praise.\" Andre summed up by saying that the album \"for anyone that needs some joy in the midst of daily life. Full of musical genius from 1 to 11; well done Rend Collective for such a captivating experience!\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Ryan Barbee said \"there are some resemblances to their last release, but overall they aren't letting it just stay at the same level. A number of the songs are more accessible to corporate church gatherings, which should make worship leaders happy. Plus, it's really good music.\" Furthermore, Barbee wrote that they have made progression in the music. Jesus Freak Hideout's Sam Schaumberg said \"while this collection diversifies from the group's debut and features more folk and grandstand worship aspects, it remains a beautiful compilation crafted by musicians clearly in awe of God.\" Louder Than the Music's Jono Davies wrote \"I love all the songs for different reasons and that's what makes a great album, a mix of styles and sounds but keeping to a great theme. The whole albums feels like a journey.\" New Release Tuesday's Kevin Davis said the album \"is the kind of unique worship album I've only dreamed was possible and is an incredible\", and he wrote the album \"is truly a memorable worship experience.\" The Phantom Tollbooth's Derek Walker said \"analyse it deeply and there is not that much new, but it is the original and authentic touches that make Rend Collective such a different experience. They draw from outside Nashville and feel very much of now. Good on them - the experiment has truly worked.\""

Although Gibb's plans as a solo artist were accelerating, he was also quoted as saying \"I'd seriously love to get back to the old Bee Gees again. I really loved the group, and I miss the unit a lot. It's things like sitting in hotel rooms together after a show and taking people off that made working in a group such fun.

Other musicians who played on the album include Leslie Harvey of Stone the Crows and Geoff Bridgford from The Groove who would join the reformed Bee Gees for a short period. The first song recorded was \"Railroad\", which was later released as a single; however, it did not chart in the US or the UK.

The 40-date \"Fall Tour 2012\". They performed as the opening act for Awolnation, and traveled across the United States in Autumn 2012 to promote the album's initial release in North America. During the tour, the band appeared on the September 4, 2012, airing of ABC late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!. They also made a historical appearance on the October 29, 2012, airing of NBC late-night talk show Late Night with Jimmy Fallon performing \"It's Time\" to an empty audience during Hurricane Sandy's passage through the New York / New Jersey metropolitan area during that weekend. In 2013, a world tour, entitled the Night Visions Tour, was executed in promotion of the worldwide release of Night Visions. Starting in February 2013, the 145-date tour saw the band perform across North America and Europe. With opening acts such as Se\u00f1ora Lanza. During the tour, the band made their first national television appearance, performing \"Radioactive\" on the February 22, 2013, airing of CBS late-night talk show Late Show with David Letterman. The band performed in front of cameras during their appearance at the 2013 Isle of Wight Festival for Vevo's Summer Six series. The performance, which took place on June 15, 2013, was released on June 25, 2013. The band made another television appearance in the United States, performing \"Radioactive\", \"Demons\" and \"On Top of the World\" on the July 4, 2013, airing of ABC morning television show Good Morning America. Critical receptionNight Visions received mixed reviews from music critics. Brian Mansfield from USA Today gave Night Visions a favorable review, writing: \"For all the group's musical mastery, it's the flourishes courtesy of producer Alex da Kid that make individual tracks stand out.\" Mansfield praised individual elements such as \"the mandolin hook of 'It's Time', the jaunty whistle of 'On Top of the World', [and] the burbling guitar in 'Demons.'\" and said that \"those creative touches may seem like small details, but it's that imagination that gives these Dragons teeth.\" Gregory Heaney of AllMusic remarked that the album \"sometimes feels as though it lacks depth\", but nonetheless called it \"an album that, at least for a few minutes at a time, will make everyday life seem just a little bit bigger\". Annie Zaleski of Las Vegas Weekly praised Night Visions for being \"well-crafted and wildly creative, and boasts solid songwriting\u2014three things that are sorely missing on albums by so many younger bands.\" Lisa Kwon of Consequence of Sound gave the album a mixed review and felt that Night Visions \"fails to match the fresh adrenaline rush that the band's first single had promised us when we first heard it on the radio or in commercials earlier this year.\" Johan Wippsson from Melodic magazine called Night Visions \"somewhat shattered, but as a whole this is a very charming and well-crafted album.\" Chris Saunders of musicOMH panned the album as \"so safe and middle of the road that it leaves you with the same hollow feeling that Las Vegas can, without the dizzying high and sensual assault that got you there in the first place.\""

After the arms-for-hostages deals hit the news, the increased public awareness of the U.S. government's covert war in Nicaragua prompted Browne to produce and pay for a video for 'Lives in the Balance' well after the album had passed its peak in terms of sales. Discussing the song at the time of the video's release, Browne said, 'I imply that the truth is kept from us on a regular basis. I flat out say the government lies. Well, these things are no longer heresy.'\" Released only as a U.S. 12\" promo and as a 7\" single in Germany, in 1986 the song was associated with American policies in Central America, but within the context of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the song received new life as a single in 2005 when a live version was released from Browne's Solo Acoustic, Vol. 1 album. The song, Mark Coleman says in the Rolling Stone Record Guide, \"is a cutting slice of social observation,\" as demonstrated in the chorus:"

'Who are the ones that we call our friends?' Browne asks on the scathingly trenchant 'Lives in the Balance' and sadly answers himself: 'Governments killing their own.'\" The song includes musical support, as Guterman noted, from members of Sangre Machehual, a Los Angeles Nueva Canci\u00f3n group. The band thought it was a prank when Browne called them up and asked them if they would play on the album, according to member Hugo Pedroza. Pedroza plays charango and tiple, Jorge Strunz plays nylon string guitar, and Quique Cruz plays zampo\u00f1a. Percussionist Deborah Dobkin and actress Mindy Sterling provide harmony vocals."

Mike Bell of Postmedia News agreed, calling it \"the album\u2019s best moment, sounding like a Gwen Stefani-M.I.A mash-up\". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also heard similarities with Gwen Stefani, writing that, \"it sounds like she's trying to win a bet that she could turn the hook from George Harrison's 'Got My Mind Set on You' into a new Hollaback Girl.\" Scott Shetler of Pop Crush wrote that the song \"has a nice groove punctuated by strong drums, sing-along chants, and possibly even a cowbell in the background. We like it even more than the two official singles we\u2019ve heard so far from the album so far \u2014 the title track and \u2018Big Hoops.\u2019\" Robert Copsey of Digital Spy wrote that \"the hypnotic, propelling melody of horns and synths will no doubt draw comparisons to MIA for its off-kilter vocals and bratty attitude as she sheepishly remarks: 'Bring your car to the parking lot and ride all night 'til you get a spot'.\" Alex Macpherson of Metro UK wrote that \"the clattery, percussive rhythms of dancefloor-ready cuts such as Parking Lot harking back to Furtado hits Promiscuous and No Hay Igual.\" Katherine St Asaph of Popdust was positive, writing that \"There\u2019s enough of a particular guitar sound\u2013you know the one, you\u2019ve heard it \u2013 that it\u2019s plausible this could actually be a radio hit (something that Furtado, thus far, hasn\u2019t had for her album.)

Like many of her previous albums, it was produced by the songwriting team of Burt Bacharach and Hal David. The album includes three songs from the musical Promises, Promises, for which Bacharach and David wrote the music and lyrics, and which would premiere a month after the album was released: the title song, \"Whoever You Are (I Love You)\" and \"Wanting Things\". The album also includes two other Bacharach/David compositions, \"This Girl's in Love with You\" (which had originally been recorded by Herb Alpert as \"This Guy's in Love with You\" earlier that year) and \"Who Is Gonna Love Me\". The album includes songs from two other musicals of the time: \"Where Is Love?\" from Oliver!, and \"Where Am I Going?\" from Sweet Charity. The title track reached the U.S. Top 20 and No. 7 Easy Listening during the late fall of 1968. \"This Girl's in Love with You,\" the follow-up single, reached number seven in February 1969."

Tom DeLonge, who originally advocated the method of using separate studios/e-mails to dictate the majority of the recording, admitted that it led to a loss of unity. Travis Barker noted that, \"there's some songs on there that I love, but for the most part it was disconnected. It was like, 'You do this part in your studio, and then you're gonna play on it and send it back to me.' When we're not in the studio together, you don't have the opportunity to gel off each other.\" In addition, Barker was still recovering from his plane crash in 2008; he stated he was a \"bloody mess\" at the time. During the band's 20th Anniversary Tour in Europe, Barker was the first to approach DeLonge and Hoppus with the idea of immediately returning to the studio in the fall. \"It was like three days after Halloween and Tom was like, 'Dude, we should do that!'\" They entered the studio on November 5. They found a flexibility to do things their own way without label intervention and it inspired creativity and agility. Mark Hoppus described: \"It was great, ideas falling everywhere. Lots of long hours spent on five new songs. [...] The band is in a great place creatively. Having everyone in the same room at the same time makes all the difference for us.\""

Alternative Press referred to it as the \"angriest, most aggressive song\" on the EP. \"Disaster\" opens with \"manipulated radio frequencies and anthemic marching drum hits\" that recalls DeLonge's band Angels & Airwaves. \"Boxing Day\", originally titled \"The Day After Christmas\", began as an acoustic folk number before Barker added an electronic drum kit, creating what Hoppus described as a \"real kind of indie, strange, cool vibe to it.\" A week prior to the EP's release, the song \"Boxing Day\" was streamed through Alternative Press. The fifth and final track, \"Pretty Little Girl\", was originally titled \"I Got My Eye on You\" and was written by DeLonge for his wife. It features a guest appearance from rapper Yelawolf. The track carries a new wave influence and synthesizers are most prominent in the mix."

While the EP isn't the best material of the band's career, it shows a promising future that looked ever so bleak just a mere three years ago.

Allmusic writer Gregory Heaney said the EP \"will surprise anyone who might have tuned out after 'All the Small Things' dominated the airwaves, but given the newfound maturity in their sound, the change is one that's both expected and welcomed.\" Kerrang! writer Paul Travers said \"the overall effect is one of a versatile, diffuse, but somehow far more focused collection of songs than were present on Neighborhoods. Added with those elements of their classic sound and what we have here is a stopgap EP that promises even greater things ahead for blink-182.\" In 2013, Chris Payne of Billboard referred to the EP as \"underrated.\""

Coolio and his crew make the ghetto seem not just a place of desolation, but of hope.\" The Source gave the album 4 Mics out of 5, and said, \"The crazy braided one brings skilled and insightful lyrics that reach and relate to all levels of the Black experience... sets standards that corny lyrics and catchy loops can't compete with... Few artists can straddle the line between commercial and underground hip-hop.\" Musician said, \"Coolio ties his music to a message that's as deep as the groove.\" Rap Pages gave the album 7 out of 10, and said, \"Maybe because he rapped for a decade with no props, got yanked on record deals... this cool-ass homie from Compton has stayed grounded... Coolio rejoices in the only life he knows.\" NME gave the album 7 out of 10, and said, \"Instead of playing the role of the Uzi-toting big-shot, he adopts a more reflective view of urban life in Los Angeles... In doing so, Coolio takes a deliberate step forward from last year's light-hearted debut.\""

It features backing vocals from several people associated with Shelton: the Pistol Annies, a group featuring Shelton's then-wife, Miranda Lambert; RaeLynn, a contestant on The Voice, on which Shelton is a judge; co-writers Rhett Akins, Dallas Davidson and Craig Wiseman; and producer Scott Hendricks. Co-writer Craig Wiseman said that the opening line \"The boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles\" came from Davidson, who made the remark after seeing Beatles memorabilia in Wiseman's office. After Davidson said the word \"redneck\", Wiseman decided to \"[chop] it up into short pieces\" to create the \"red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck\" heard in the opening. Of the song's theme, Wiseman said that he felt it was an example of \"write what you know\" despite criticism of songs which use similar Southern themes. Shelton said of the song, \"That song had me from the first, 'cause I thought about all the guys I know back in Tishamingo. None of them listened to The Beatles. They listened to Hank, or these days you'll hear Jason Aldean blaring out of somebody's car coming from a mile away. It's just how they are, and that song is just written exactly how I live.\""

Recorded in Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles in January 2013, the album contains several blues songs (like its predecessor).

Similarly to Let Them Talk, Laurie once again plays piano and guitar, and often provides vocals. Additionally, Laurie is joined by guest musicians Gaby Moreno, Jean McClain, and Taj Mahal, and is supported throughout by the Copper Bottom Band. Didn't It Rain was released in the UK on 6 May 2013, with iTunes providing pre-order and digital releases, and Amazon providing vinyl prints and a special book edition.

The song is a parody of Tony Hatch's song \"Downtown\" which was a hit for Petula Clark (because of the use of the melody, Hatch also receives songwriting credit). The song reached #6 on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart and #40 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1965; it was Sherman's last top-40 hit. The song is sung from the point of view of a father whose teenaged children have gone \"frooging\" downtown with their car and money. At first, the parents are relieved that they can now use the phone and the bath tub but, as the hours pass, they get increasingly nervous. Meanwhile their offspring  frug to the songs of Petula Clark while they are downtown. Eventually, the parents take Miltown in order to calm themselves down. However the father gets a phone call telling him that their children have been arrested as the result of a car accident, prompting him to angrily borrow someone else's car to get his sons home. He then vows to ground the teenagers and go downtown with his wife, where he promises to do \"very nice dances\" including the tango, waltz, foxtrot, and bunny hop, instead of the dances of the younger generation such as the Frug, the Swim, the Mashed Potato or the Jerk."

After the phone conversation, Fantasia walked back into the studio and requested Harmony Samuels to give her something \"hood.\" When asked on what \"sparked her outrage\", Fantasia replied, \"Exactly what I said in the song.

Go ahead and get your shine time now, but it's going to die soon because there is no talent.

Gomez began planning the project in 2012, at which time she announced that her band Selena Gomez & the Scene would be taking an indefinite hiatus, and continued work into 2013. With Britney Spears, Taylor Swift and Skrillex as influences on the record, Stars Dance is an EDM and electropop album, incorporating elements of dubstep, techno, disco, electro house and worldbeat. Gomez worked with producers such as Rock Mafia and The Cataracs (now known as KSHMR) on the album. Upon its release, Stars Dance received generally mixed reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented Gomez's maturing image and the album's content both lyrically and vocally, but criticized the album's electronic-heavy production style. It marked her first album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200. The album sold 97,000 copies in its first week of release in the country, making it her highest-selling debut to that point. This was later surpassed by its successor, Revival (2015), which sold 117,000 units in its first week. It became her fourth top twenty entry in the United Kingdom, peaking at number fourteen. Elsewhere, Stars Dance topped the charts in Canada, Brazil, Greece, Hungary, Norway, and China.

Although reviews from contemporary music critics were mixed, the album was a commercial success. In January 2012, Gomez announced that she would put her music career on hold in order to focus on her acting career, and that the band would be taking a hiatus: \"my band and I are going our separate ways for a while. This year is all about films and acting and I want my band to play music wherever with whoever. We will be back but, it will be a good while.\" Despite her earlier statements, Gomez first confirmed in October 2012 that work had begun on an upcoming album, and later said it would be her solo debut album, rather than her band's fourth album. Gomez announced in March that the album's lead single would be released the following month, and that the album would follow that Summer. On April 15, Gomez revealed plans of  her first world tour, known as the Stars Dance Tour. Gomez officially confirmed on June 3 that the album would be titled Stars Dance, and also revealed the album's track listing and cover art. On her return to music, Gomez stated \"I miss it. I want to be able to write about things I've never talked about before and tell a story with this album, because I've never actually had time to go in and do that.\" For the album, Gomez made it with production team The Cataracs, as well as the Norwegian Stargate. Gomez also worked with Rock Mafia on numerous tracks on the album, having previously worked with them on previous singles with The Scene. For Stars Dance, Gomez attempted to have more creative control over her music, stating \"It's definitely the hardest I have ever worked on a record, that's for sure. I wanted to have more creative control over the album's direction.\" Jason Evigan, who worked with Gomez on the album, said \"She's not a little girl anymore. She wants to be like that and be respected like the great pop artists out there [...] And I think she is. I think this album is really gonna blossom her into a new realm of electronic pop dance artist.\" Prior to the album's release, Gomez announced she would be taking a musical hiatus after Stars Dance, commenting \"I've been saying that I worked really hard on this record and I feel like it might be my last one for a while [...] I definitely love acting and I love film and I don't feel like I've done enough of that.\" Following the album's announcement, numerous sources began claiming that the majority of the album was written about Gomez's relationship with Bieber. These rumors continued to rise in popularity following the release of \"Come & Get It\", and prompted Gomez to confirm that the song was not about Bieber. She later said, however, that the song \"Love Will Remember\" is about her relationship with Bieber. She revealed the song was \"the most personal track on the record\", and added \"I think it's a sweet way of releasing it. It's not an aggressive approach to what people are probably expecting. I'm sure he'll love mikey too.\" The song \"Birthday\" was the first song recorded for the album. Gomez has listed \"Forget Forever\" as one of her favorite tracks on the album saying, \"It's a really beautiful song. It has meaning behind it and it was a really special time in the studio. I got to be with the writers and just enjoy being in that moment. That was a really fun emotional song for me to sing but then I just kind of wanted to dance after I released it because it felt like I got to release this feeling that I had and it's a beautiful song.\" She later spoke of \"Forget Forever\" by stating \"It's forgetting all the troubles, about the past, just enjoying everything else.\" Recording artist Jennifer Lopez wanted to record the song \"Save the Day\" for her 2013 album, but failed to get it from Gomez. \"Come & Get It\" was initially recorded by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna for her sixth studio album. However, she decided against using the song."

Jocelyn Vena of MTV News described the music on Stars Dance as \"dance-song-heavy\" dubstep, that contains \"wobbly synths, loopy vocals, fist-pumping beats and crunchy breakdowns\". The album contains a highly diverse musical composition, highlighted by Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian as \"darting efficiently from EDM to Bollywood\". The majority of the album contains dubstep breakdowns, requisite stabs of synths, and according to Jim Farber of New York Daily News, \"features a frisson of sex previously absent from this good-girl singer's work.\" Jason Evigan said of the album's musical style, \"She's got some really cool like ethnic influence, kind of tribally dance drums and stuff like that\", stating that it was similar to music by Jennifer Lopez. August Brown of the Los Angeles Times called Stars Dance a \"sassy\" pop-EDM album, noting its composition included \"oxygen-sucking\" sub-bass, trap snares. Brown noted the influence of Spring Breakers on the album, saying that Gomez wasn't ready to leave the \"neon-splattered emotional hellscape of Spring Breakers just yet\". He further went on to say: \"Stars Dance is exactly the kind of album one makes in 2013 if you want to keep the pop sugar of the Disney tween cabal but mix in some broken glass and a club bathroom nosebleed. Its productions are rooted in today's pop-EDM default mode, but as that stuff goes, 'Slow Down' is pretty capable, and the bhangra-appropriating 'Come & Get It' is guilelessly silly enough to work.\" The album's title track was described by Gomez as being \"kind of sensual\", while \"Like a Champion\" is said to feature Jamaican and reggae influences. When talking about the song \"Save the Day\", Gomez stated \"Do you ever have moments where you don't ever want them to end? I've had those moments. It's about saving those moments and never wanting it to go away.\" The song \"Write Your Name\" is about the feeling of falling in love. Gomez described B.E.A.T. by saying \"The song is cool and the lyrics are great, but it was more, 'I can't wait to perform this song onstage because I love the way I feel when I hear this song.' It's just dope.\" Gomez later stated that \"Undercover\" was her favorite song on the album, commenting \"I've never had the confidence to do different licks and melody changes. I messed up a lot [while recording] that one.\" The album's lead single, \"Come & Get It\", has been described as featuring \"Bollywood\" influences, as well as tribal music. On-air personality Peter Dee noted that the song featured various electropop elements. \"Slow Down\" is noted as featuring various dubstep influences, while the song's lyrics speak of taking a relationship slowly rather than rushing into things. Gomez has listed Britney Spears and Janet Jackson as some of the album's biggest influences, and later cited Skrillex, Taylor Swift, and Christina Aguilera as major influences on the record. She listed dubstep producer Skrillex as an influence to the album, with him having previously worked on the soundtrack for Gomez's film Spring Breakers. She later stated \"Doing Spring Breakers was really fun, because Skrillex and Cliff Martinez did the soundtrack, and [Skrillex] kind of inspired me with a baby dubstep, because I have a few songs that have that.\" Jim Farber of New York Daily News noted influences of Spears, Jennifer Lopez, and Janet Jackson, although going on to say \"Gomez's writer and producers have aped other stars' tricks gamely enough to create a pretty good time. It helps that Gomez boasts a far richer voice than her idols, Britney, J.Lo and Janet.\""

It features a dubstep chorus, funk guitars, a four on the floor beat, and a spoken word outro. Lyrically, the song speaks of \"slowing down the song\" so the party doesn't end. \"Stars Dance\", the album's title track, is a \"breathy and sultry\" dubstep song, which contains an orchestral-dubstep beat. According to Rubin, \"Gomez's soft voice takes center stage over sexy synth-beats, icy choruses and wallowing melodies.\" \"Stars Dance\" has also received comparisons to the works of Britney Spears. \"Like a Champion\" is a dancehall song, with influences of funk, reggae, and soca music, and features Gomez singing the song in a Bajan accent.

Music as \"minimal spoken word electro\". Christina Drill of Popdust said the song was \"infectious and definitely racier than usual for Selena (the chorus: 'It's a big bad world but I'm not ashamed / I like the lights in my hand and the beat in my face')\". \"Write Your Name\" has been described as an \"exotic\" sounding electronic dance and house music song. The song contains elements of dubstep. O'Brien of Yahoo! Music said that: \"Forget Forever' and 'Write Your Name' both manage to tiptoe into 'hands in the air' territory without succumbing to the usual Guetta-style bombast.\""

Tim Sendra from Allmusic awarded the album three-and-a-half stars out of five. As he pointed out \"Slow Down\", \"Save the Day\" and \"Undercover\" as highlights, he said \"Selena's reliably strong vocals and the variety of sounds, it adds up to be another fine entry in her catalog and just another example of why Selena Gomez is one of the best pop stars making music in 2013.\" Stephen Unwin from Express.co.uk compared the new effort to Vanessa Hudgens and said \"Both [Gomez and Hudgens] have now turned their attention to themes of a more adult nature, this new album of Selena's being one of them and she's just about pulled it off.\" Two Guardian reviews were issued.

He criticized her \"lack of personality\" in most songs and felt her vocal abilities on the album \"doesn't help\". He concluded saying \"It's all too identikit, [and] could be anyone with a grasp of average dance-pop\". Simon Price from The Independent awarded one star out of the five, criticizing the lack of effort saying that \"Even given these facts, it's a pop record, which means one killer track would redeem everything. Predictably enough, it never comes.\" Ron Harris from The Huffington Post felt the album did not live up to expectations, citing Gomez as a \"vibrant young woman of Disney pedigree [who] simply punched the clock and worked through an already cooked musical plot foisted upon her. Gomez might be an incredibly talented and interesting person with much to offer artistically, but we'll never find out at this rate.\" He also found the album to have less personality than her previous records with The Scene."

I sort of wrote it for the heads, really, the people thinking, \"ah, so that's where Entwistle's brain's at, he really sort of believes in the devil and hell and all that sort of business.\" So I wrote a number that touches on reincarnation, then goes into the absurd, with Father Christmas and the whole bit and right at the end just to prevent the heads from thinking that I did believe in everything like I was saying, 'cause they always seem to believe that you actually believe in your own words. I believe in some of them but not all of them, so I just wrote the joke in to throw them off, and it's done it. The song ends with a chorus of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\"."

While the album was initially planned to be \"darker\" than her previous material, Prism ultimately became a prominently dance-inspired record. Perry worked with several past collaborators, while enlisting new producers and guest vocals. Much of Prism revolves around the themes of living in the present, relationships, and self-empowerment. The album garnered generally positive reviews with critics praising its lyrical content for being more \"mature\" and personal, while others considered Prism to be more formulaic than her previous material. The album debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with 286,000 copies sold, becoming Perry's best opening week to date. The album also peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Prism became Perry's fastest-selling album, the second best-selling album in Australia in 2013, and the second best-selling album released by a woman in the United States in 2013. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that Prism was the sixth best-selling album in the world in 2013, the best-selling album in the world in 2013 released by a woman, and labeled Perry \"a global phenomenon.\" It has sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The album's success continued throughout 2014, ranking within the top 10 of the annual charts for 2014 in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and earned Perry a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. The release of the album was preceded by the release of two singles. \"Roar\" was released on August 10, 2013, as the album's lead single and topped the Billboard Hot 100. \"Unconditionally\" debuted on October 16, 2013, as the record's second single. In between the release of these two tracks were the releases of promotional singles \"Dark Horse\" on September 17 and \"Walking on Air\" on September 30, 2013. \"Dark Horse\" was released as the album's third single three months later on December 17, 2013, and also reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Birthday\" and \"This Is How We Do\" were the fourth and fifth singles, respectively. Prism was further promoted through the Prismatic World Tour."

When ex-husband Russell Brand left her on December 30, 2011, she felt devastated and contemplated suicide. Perry revealed to Vogue in June 2012 that she planned to record a \"darker\" album than her previous records. She stated: \"It was inevitable, after what I went through. If I had a time machine and could go back in time, I would. But I can't, so, you'll discover another part of me.\" To Interview, she mentioned that she aspired to include a more acoustic vibe to the record. Perry also said that her music would be getting \"real fucking dark\" and \"shoegazing\", though also stated that her fans would be able to relate to it. \"I imagine that maybe my next record would be a little bit more of an artistic venture,\" she said. \"Not that I'm going to self-sabotage either and be like, 'I'm going to make a crazy record that nobody really understands.'\" That fall, she later told Billboard about her plans for the album, saying she already envisioned several aspects of it. Perry told the magazine that she already had songs and ideas, and knew the type of record she would make next. She also said that although she had not started recording yet, she already knew how the artwork, coloring and tone of the album would turn out. Perry further detailed: \"I have to let the music take shape first. I even know what type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision I have in my head becomes a reality. But I have to honor the music.\""

        "content": "The development of Prism started when Perry was embarking on the California Dreams Tour. She began with a process she deemed \"slow cooking\", which consisted of recording random \"fragments of ideas\" into her mobile phone's dictaphone application. A member of Direct Management Group, Ngoc Hoang, then transcribed the audio files, which he inserted into what Perry described as a \"treasure chest\"; such object was consulted by Perry later on during the album's recording sessions. While Perry started recording the album officially in November 2012, accompanied by Greg Wells and Greg Kurstin, she noted she was still in a \"dark place\", and that she had not \"let the light in\". The sessions began again in March 2013, following a trip to Madagascar which Perry credited as having \"put [her] priorities in perspective\", thus leading her to \"do more work on [her]self\". Perry also viewed a video made by Eckhart Tolle, which discusses loss. She commented: \"When you lose something, all your foundations crumble\u2014but that also leaves a big hole that's open for something great to come through.\" After feeling prepared to record again, she reunited with her team from Teenage Dream\u2014Dr. Luke, Bonnie McKee, and Cirkut\u2014in Perry's hometown of Santa Barbara, California, where they spent a month recording at Playback Recording Studio among others. After those sessions, she went to Stockholm, where she worked with Scandinavian record producer Max Martin, to do what Perry called \"put[ting] the ice on the cake\". She also recruited other collaborators, such as Norwegian team Stargate, Bloodshy, Benny Blanco, Jonatha Brooke and Sia. By April 2013, recording for the album was halfway complete, and Perry revealed to ASCAP how was working with such collaborators. She affirmed that Wells allowed her to \"vomit words\"; with Martin, she picked the melodies of the songs; Luke mostly helmed the production and she worked with \"topline and melody\". Perry described writing sessions with McKee as \"emotional abuse\", adding that they argue over the \"best lyric\", as if they were fighting in a boxing ring. McKee, who wrote four songs for Prism, spoke with MTV on the effort, describing it as \"a little bit more grown up\" and \"interesting\"."

        "content": "The album opens with \"Roar\", a midtempo synth-driven power pop track. Musically, it contains elements of arena rock and glam rock, while lyrically it is an empowerment anthem. Comparisons were established between \"Roar\" and \"Brave\" by Sara Bareilles. \"Legendary Lovers\", a bhangra-based song, deals with the concepts of karma and infinity. \"Birthday\" was described by Perry as her own attempt at \"writing something Mariah Carey would have put on her first record\". Musically, it is a \"fluffy\" pop song that is primarily styled in the genre of disco. \"Walking on Air\", the album's second promotional single, is an early 1990s-inspired deep house-Eurodance-disco song, inspired heavily by CeCe Peniston and Crystal Waters. It was produced by Klas \u00c5hlund and Max Martin. \"Unconditionally\", Perry's personal favorite song on the album and second official single, is a \"soaring\" power ballad with an \"epic chorus\". Jason Lipshutz from Billboard noted that the song includes a \"woodblock percussion\" as well as \"a dramatic bass line\" and deemed it the album's \"most mature offering\". Furthermore, he called it \"an ode to love that looks past all flaws\" and stated that the song acts as a \"compellingly grounded predicate\" to the title track from Teenage Dream. Perry herself described the song as a song about unconditional love that could come in all forms, including those from relationships, from parent-to-child, and from sibling-to-sibling. \"Dark Horse\" is a song with ample influences of trap, grime, hip hop, and \"Southern rap-techno mashup\" genres. \"This Is How We Do\", produced by Max Martin and Klas Ahlund, was described as being the possible \"song of summer\" for 2014. Shirley Halperin from The Hollywood Reporter described \"This Is How We Do\" as \"a sunny 80s throwback\", while Edna Gundersen from USA Today described it as a \"buoyant pop blast with hip-hop underpinnings\" and praised the song's recurring refrain (\"It's no big deal!\"). James Montgomery from MTV News called the song a \"cocksure, club-ready banger\". With \"Double Rainbow\", produced by Greg Kustin and co-writer Sia, Perry was allowed to \"dump pent-up emotions\" and \"get things off her chest\". The song was described as a \"massive ballad\". Lipshutz deemed it as a \"breathy love track\" with a \"powerful chorus that explodes upon impact\" with lyrics that include \"One man's trash is another man's treasure / so if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever\". He added that \"Kurstin brings the pop sensibility he's flashed with artists like Kelly Clarkson and P!nk, while Sia's presence connects this sleek, shimmering pop track to [her David Guetta collaboration] 'Titanium'\". Elijah Sarkesian felt that \"Some of Katy's finest vocals of the album are on this song\". Perry described \"Love Me\" as a song \"about loving yourself the way you want to be loved\". Gundersen called it \"irresistibly catchy and energetic\". The song was produced by Bloodshy. Sarkesian called it \"an interesting mix \u2013 the lyrics are dark, but the music is very dance-centric. At the very least, it'll do well in clubs\". Montgomery stated that \"Love Me\" and \"International Smile\" both \"seem destined for the dance floors\". The latter was inspired by Perry's friend Mia Moretti, and was compared to the songs on Perry's previous album. Lipshutz called it a \"straightforward pop-rock offering\" and described its guitar hook as \"kicky\", adding that the song also includes a \"Melting Daft Punk-esque vocoder breakdown\". Halperin stated that in the song, Perry sings the \"hooky\" line: \"Please fasten your seat belts and make sure your champagne glasses are empty\". Halperin described \"This Moment\" and \"Ghost\" as \"mid-tempo ballads that are closest in DNA to Perry's previous smashes\". Perry stated that she was inspired to write \"This Moment\" after she heard the audio book of The Power of Now; the song's lyrics talk about \"living in the present\"; with Perry \"add[ing] a romantic spin\" to it. Gary Trust described \"Ghost\" as a \"mesmerizing ballad\", while Gundersen described it as \"powerful, dark, and haunting\". Lipshutz felt that \"Ghost\" and \"By the Grace of God\" contain the album's \"most somber moments\". While talking about each Prism track, Perry mentioned that \"By the Grace of God\" was the first song she wrote and recorded for the album back in November 2012 while she was in her \"dark\" phase. Jody Rosen from Vulture described bonus track \"Spiritual\" as an inspirational song. Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast described \"It Takes Two\" as a \"sweeping ballad\" which allowed Perry to \"show off a full-throated belt that so many of her more bubbly tracks mask\". In \"Choose Your Battles\", Perry \"pounds her chest and spews venom at the man she cannot understand\"."

        "content": "Upon release, Prism received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars, writing that \"Perry and her longtime collaborators Dr. Luke and Max Martin often go for a darker, moodier intimacy \u00e0 la high-end Swedish divas Robyn and Lykke Li. Perry has always done a great job of letting us know she's in on the joke of pop stardom. Sadly, she doesn't always bring that same sense of humor and self-awareness to the joke of pop-star introspection. The album's raft of ripe-lotus ballads is larded with Alanis-ian poesy she can't pull off\". Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ and stated that \"Katy's superpower, now more than ever, is minting songs so relatable that their insights quickly scale up to inspirational..... Now she grasps that she's making the mainstream, not just swimming in it\". Helen Brown from The Daily Telegraph gave the album five out of five stars, stating Perry \"sounds like a woman, and an artist, who's finally found herself\" and praised the \"vulnerability\" of the album. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic, Alexis Petridis from The Guardian, and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine all also gave the album three out of five stars. Erlewine dubbed Prism \"a tighter, cleaner record than its predecessors\". Petridis called it \"Katy Perry's most spiritual album to date\". Mesfin Fekadu from ABC News deemed the tracks \"likable\", but felt the album lacked \"some of the fiery fierceness and excitement that dominated Teenage Dream\". James Reed from The Boston Globe felt Perry \"always seemed like the pop star who knows precisely what she does best\" and called the album \"an unabashedly fun listen\". Chris Bosman from Consequence of Sound gave the album three and a half out of five stars, calling Perry \"a champion of choruses\". Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune gave the album 2 out of 4 stars, commenting \"Though not exactly spiritual, Prism does come off as a more serious\u2014if no less formulaic\u2014album than its predecessor\". Marah Eakin from The A.V. Club gave the album a C+, commenting \"A lot of Prism is simply forgettable\", though praised the tracks \"Roar\", \"Birthday\", and \"This Is How We Do\". Rob Harvilla from Spin gave the album a 5/10 rating, and felt some of the material was not \"all that desirable\". Elysa Gardner from USA Today gave the album a 3/4 rating and found the album to be \"genuine and endearing\". Trent Wolbe from The Verge gave an overall 4/4 rating and praised Perry's ability to \"wrapping hyper-specific emotions into a new format that everyone can relate to\". He particularly praised the tracks \"International Smile\" and \"Birthday\", declaring the chorus of \"Birthday\" to be \"fucking perfect\". Jody Rosen from Vulture was disappointed with every track on the album except for \"Roar\". Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times gave the album a 3/4 rating, calling it \"a shimmering, dynamic, heavy-duty modern pop album\". At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, Prism was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album, but lost against Sam Smith's In the Lonely Hour."

        "content": "Prism made its official debut in Ireland, where it charted atop the charts. In the United States, the album opened at the top spot on the US Billboard 200, becoming her second consecutive number one album in the country. The album sold 286,000 copies in its first week. Prism acquired the largest first week sum by a female artist for 2013, surpassing Miley Cyrus' Bangerz (270,000 copies). However, this feat was surpassed by Beyonc\u00e9's self-titled fifth album, Beyonc\u00e9 (617,213 digital copies), released in December 2013. At the time of its release Prism had the fourth highest first week sales of the year for a pop record, trailing behind Daft Punk's May 2013 album Random Access Memories, which sold 339,000 copies and Justin Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience which debuted to 968,000 copies and its follow-up The 20/20 Experience \u2013 2 of 2 which debuted to just 350,000 copies. The first week sales also marks Perry's highest weekly sales, with her previous album Teenage Dream selling 192,000 copies in its first week in August 2010. Prism has the highest first week sales for a female pop artist since Madonna's twelfth studio album, MDNA. Prism sold 92,000 copies during its second week of availability, falling to number two on the Billboard 200. This represented the smallest sales dip for a number one album in the United States since the August 2013 release of The Civil Wars. Prism spent 17 weeks in the top-ten on the chart. The album has been certified double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 1.74 million copies in the United States as of August 2020. In June 2014, Billboard announced its Mid Year Top 20 Best-selling albums with Prism coming in at number 9 with sales of 453,000 in 2014 alone. Pharrell Williams and Perry were the only two people in to have an album and a single in the Mid Year Top 10 charts. In February 2015, following Perry's performance at the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show, sales for the album increased by 85% and the album rebounded back into the Top 50. In New Zealand, the album became Perry's second consecutive number one album, and was certified gold by Recorded Music NZ, selling over 7,500 copies in its first week sales. Prism opened atop the ARIA Album Charts, giving the singer her second number-one album in Australia after Teenage Dream. It was the nation's 688th album to top its charts overall and 342nd to enter at the summit. The record received a Platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) during its second week of release, and became the country's second highest-selling album of the year behind Pink's The Truth About Love with 179,000 copies sold by the end of 2013. In Europe, the album was a moderate success. In Switzerland, the album debuted at two, just behind James Blunt's Moon Landing and was certified Gold shortly after. In Austria, the album debuted at number three and was certified Gold in its first week, achieving Platinum certification a month later. In France, Prism debuted in the Top 10, spending a dozen weeks in the Top 40, and has sold over 130,000 copies according to SNEP. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at the top of the charts, where it was certified Platinum and went on to sell 433,000 copies by February 2017. In The Netherlands and Denmark, the album debuted and peaked at number four. As of August 2015, Prism has sold over 4 million copies worldwide."

Written by Clarkson with Greg Kurstin, who also produced it, it is a Christmas-themed song that sings of gratitude for companionship during the holidays, in which the loved one is referred to as the only present needed \"underneath the tree\". Accompanied by various instrumental sounds, the song prominently incorporates a Wall of Sound treatment along with sleigh bells and bell chimes to resonate a holiday atmosphere. \"Underneath the Tree\" was first released to Adult Contemporary radio stations on November 5, 2013, by RCA Records as the lead single from the album. \"Underneath the Tree\" has been praised by music critics, who considered it the main highlight of Wrapped in Red and lauded its potential to be a holiday classic. They also favorably compared it to the 1994 modern Christmas standard \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" by Mariah Carey. The track recurrently charts as a global top ten hit every holiday season and has been certified platinum in Denmark and the United Kingdom, and gold in Australia and Norway. Filmed by English director Hamish Hamilton, the music video for the song has a live performance from the television special Kelly Clarkson's Cautionary Christmas Music Tale at the Venetian Las Vegas.

Greg Kurstin, whom she had previously collaborated with, was approached by Clarkson to produce the album; and together, they co-wrote the tracks \"Underneath the Tree\" and \"4 Carats\". \"Underneath the Tree\" was produced by Kurstin, who also played most of the instruments, including a mellotron and a Chamberlin, to evoke a Phil Spector's Wall of Sound treatment\u2014a sound that Billboard and HitFix noticed upon hearing the song. He also had Clarkson provide all the voices in it, including all its backing vocals. She recalled the experience as new, stating, \"I've never had to do anything like this before\u2014doing all my backup vocals, essentially being my own choir.\" \"Underneath the Tree\" is an uptempo big band-style Christmas, pop song written by Clarkson and Kurstin. It is one of the five original songs recorded for Wrapped in Red. According to the sheet notes at Musicnotes published by EMI Music Publishing, the song was written in the key of E major, in which the vocal range spans from E4 to G5. Apart from the Wall of Sound, various other sounds, such as sleigh bells and bell chimes, are also prominently heard on the song, which features a bari saxophone solo on the bridge."

Billboards Marisa Fox called it as the album's \"biggest surprise\", and described it as an optimistic tune that has Clarkson powering through Darlene Love-style vocals. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times described it as a remarkably cheery single. In her review, Christina Vinson of Taste of Country remarked that the track \"has everything a Christmas song could want: a jazzy, big band sound, saxophone and bells ringing, all bottled up in an optimistic and catchy holiday track\" and said that Clarkson \"shines\", as her \"strong vocals are needed to offset the snazzy production and chorus.\" In his review, Idolator's Carl Williott wrote that the song \"sounds instantly familiar\u2014sleigh bells, laments about a lonely Christmas day, a sax solo\u2014but with a tightly coiled hook and Clarkson\u2019s transcendent voice, the whole thing is kind of invigorating.\" Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called it a bouncy, cooing number tailor-made to soundtrack sleigh rides, and named it the best track on the album. Critics also approvingly compared it to Mariah Carey's modern Christmas classic \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" (1994), a track that RCA chief executive Peter Edge described as the song's inspiration. Williot added that \"Underneath the Tree\" is strong enough that it could enter the pantheon of modern Christmas staples like Carey's \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" and 'N Sync's \"Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays\". Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV News remarked, \"if we may be so bold, it is definitely on par with other impeccable Christmas originals\u2014namely Carey's \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\".\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted the similar themes of both songs, and that \"Underneath the Tree\" is likely to become Clarkson's very own contemporary standard. Melinda Newman of HitFix wrote, \"It's a finger-popping, bell-ringing pleaser that could achieve that rare feat of becoming a new Christmas standard. That hasn't happened since Carey's \"All I Want For Christmas\" in 1994.\" The Independents Hugh Montgomery called \"Underneath The Tree\" a \"winner on all fronts\" for having \"sass, jingle, and a sax solo\"."

On June 6, 2013, Justice described material from her album: When you hear these songs...the people that know me are like, 'This is so Vic!' It's 100 percent my personality, messages I want to get across. Some of the songs are really fun, upbeat stuff you can dance to, and then I have some songs that are a little more introspective, a little more mellow. It's just all me, basically, so it's very cool. She later commented on her album again: \"'Gold' is more mainstream pop, and I wrote another song that I'm super excited about, and it's one of my favorites that I've ever written...I'm just exploring with a bunch of different sounds. It's been really fun getting to write most of my music.\" The song was produced by the Swedish production team the Struts, along with Anne Preven, Jason Weiss, and Peter Thomas."

It was released by RCA Records as the album's second single on 17 January 2014. The track was written and produced by American rapper Snob Scrilla, with additional songwriting by Cassie Davis and additional production by Baby. \"Braveheart\" conceptualized accidentally when the group found its demo version on the song producers' laptop and insisted that they record the song. It is an uptempo EDM dance-pop song  which comprises \"euphoric\" instrumentation, a \"hammering\" bass line, \"hands-in-the-air\" synths and \"pulsing\" beats. \"Braveheart\" contains uplifting lyrical themes and ideals of experiences in a night club. The song was met with generally favourable reviews from contemporary music critics who praised its production as well as the group's vocal performance. Some honed \"Braveheart\" as the best single released by a girl group in 2014, while others were divided in opinion over the song's rap section. The song is Neon Jungle's most successful single to-date. It bowed at number four on the UK Singles Chart and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales of 200,000 units. \"Braveheart\" peaked at number two in Scotland, and also became the group's first charting single in Ireland and Australia where it peaked within the top 20 in both countries. An accompanying music video, directed by Emil Nava, was released on 11 December 2013. It depicts the group as \"in touch with their spirit animals,\" in several illumuniously-coloured settings, and its imagery and styling was lauded by music critics. Neon Jungle have performed \"Braveheart\" at the 2014 Manchester Pride and at London night club G-A-Y."

In addition, the quartet liked what the producers had written and said \"No, stop! What was that? Play that again!\" At the time, Neon Jungle were to depart to Los Angeles the next day and it was the last time the group had left to record with their producers. On the day, at 01:00, the group insisted on recording the song and did so through the early hours of the morning. In an interview with VanityHype Magazine, Neon Jungle mentioned, \"While we were doing it we were vibing off it and we had our own words and stuff, so it was just like a vibey night, ha ha!\" \"Welcome to the Jungle\" was initially planned to be released as the group's second single but was put on-hold in favour of \"Braveheart\". Speaking to Beverley Lyons of the Daily Record, group member Shereen Cutkelvin mentioned, \"We didn't even know the title at first so that wasn't the reason we went for it. As soon as we heard the beat, we just knew it was the one.\" She also stated that if the group never \"randomly found\" the song, it would have never been recorded and deemed it her favourite song on their debut album, Welcome to the Jungle (2014). Cutkelvin went on to tell Lyons, \"It felt even more awesome when I found out the name. The beat was killer, it was calling us so we released it as our second single instead [of 'Welcome to the Jungle']\".

AndPop's Rebecca Mattina quipped, \"Without a doubt this song belongs in a nightclub, obviously one with lots of flashing lights and loud speakers.\" According to Michael Cragg of The Guardian, the song \"refined the sound of 'Trouble' into a more club friendly, but no less characterful, mix of pulsing synths and huge bass drops\".

Renowned for Sound's Stephanie Ochona opined that the song was \"more modern\" in tone in comparison with other girl band singles. It features a rapped section that has been described as \"oddly cheese obsessed\", \"Talking about fresh, we're talking about lettuce, all those things the lifestyle get us, steak and cheddar, chopping feta\". The section's songwriter, Scrilla, felt that comprising American slang would make the track \"fun\". In the song, Zdrenka makes use of a Japanese count off, \"Ichi, ni, san, kaesu!\" It was included due to Zdrenka being half-Japanese and as a climax before the song's drop. Lyrically, \"Braveheart\" \"feel-good,\" and comprises uplifting themes that have been likened to American actor Mel Gibson's freedom speech from the 1995 film of the same name. Neon Jungle have stated that the track is about \"letting go and having a good time\". The group consider the song to contrast with \"Trouble\" which they described as a \"getting ready to go out\" song, while they felt \"Braveheart\" was a song \"you'll hear in the middle of a club, where all the dancefloor comes together.\" Musically, \"Braveheart\" has been likened to the works of Barbadian recording artist Rihanna and French disc jockey David Guetta. While Thomas H Green of The Arts Desk felt the song's production was reminiscent to that of \"Selfie\" by American duo The Chainsmokers."

        "content": "\"Braveheart\" received generally favourable reviews from contemporary music critics, who were however divided in opinion on its rap section. Scottish newspaper the Daily Record awarded the song a four (out of five)-star rating and quipped, \"Little Mix sound like old ladies compared to this\". Idolator's Sam Lansky deemed the track \"one of the most blisteringly cool dance-pop singles in a long while,\" and lauded it as \"weird, dark, pummeling and thoroughly out-of-the-box.\" Lansky went on to deem \"Braveheart\" a \"ravey radio smash in the making\". Maxie Molotov-Smith of Fortitude Magazine honed the song as a \"monstrous rave-ruckus\" and commended the group's \"in-your-face\" attitude and \"immoveable\" confidence on the track. In addition, Molotov-Smith praised the song's \"colossal and euphoric instrumental that invites any listener to lose themselves in the hammering bass line.\" Fuse's Jeff Benjamin deemed the song a \"fiery, in-your-face banger\". Stephanie Ochona of Renowned for Sound gave the song a four and a half (out of five)-star rating, and deemed it \"a beast of a track\". She praised the song's \"infectious\" beat, \"catchy\" chorus, and the group's \"beautiful voices that fit in perfectly with each other\". Furthermore, Ochona complimented the song's mix of singing and rapping, opining that it showcased the girl band's diversity.  4Music described the track as an \"urban dance hit perfect for New Years Eve\". Music website Sugarscape.com stated that they were \"a little obsessed\" with the song and deemed its rap section \"ridiculously amazing\". In a review of Welcome to the Jungle, Entertainmentwise's Nick Reilly commented: \"We're grabbed from the moment that the song opens by the club sound that leads the track. This, paired with a fantastically tenacious chorus and an unexpected diversion into rap sets the bar pretty damn high for the rest of the album!\" Rory Cashin of Entertainment.ie described \"Braveheart\" as \"the perfect follow-up\" to \"Trouble\" and \"a sexy little number you won't be able stop your body from reacting to\". AndPop's Rebecca Mattina commended the track's immediate bassline, \"sultry\" vocals and McCarthy's \"sassy\" rap solo, and felt that \"Braveheart\" was \"perfect\" for electropop fans who need a \"heart-thumping jam\". Gay Times journalist Lee Dalloway said the track was \"certainly worthy of a good rinsing on the club circuit\", and commended its \"well-crafted\" pitch and \"on the floor\" credential. Writing for The Guardian, Michael Cragg commended the production and Neon Jungle's character on the song, and quipped, \"Following an odd year for girl bands in 2013, Neon Jungle might just be able to make things right again in 2014\". Cragg, however, opined that the girl band \"might need to work on their rapping skills\". \"Braveheart\" was awarded a three (out of five)-star rating by Digital Spy's Robert Copsey, who felt the song was \"a menacing club banger\" and \"tailored for radio,\" and praised the each girl band member for vocally \"coming into their own\". Like Cragg, Copsey was however also critical of the group's rapping ability, writing, \"And while we can forgive the slight lack of originality, the dodgy rap breakdown on which they rhyme 'stacking cheddar' with 'chopping feta' we just cannot.\" Charly Barnes of The Galleon awarded \"Braveheart\" a six (out of ten)-star rating and commended the quartet's \"strong vocals\" on the song, but deemed the track \"marmite\" and felt the group should \"lay off attempted rapping\". Jon O'Brien from Yahoo! Celebrity felt that the track was \"undeniably addictive\" and that it continued to establish Neon Jungle as \"the world's most in-yer-face girlband\". O'Brien, however, called the rap \"slightly dodgy\" and stated \"there's little here to distinguish the track from the wave of Guetta-esque club bangers that have swamped the charts this decade.\" Ian Gittins of Virgin Media highlighted the song as Neon Jungle's best and as \"killer Kelis-style rave-pop\", but felt it was \"spoilt by shrill\". On 2 August 2014, Vada Magazine's Mark Rocks lauded \"Braveheart\" as \"still the most exciting thing released by a girl group in 2014,\" opining that it was \"effortlessly refreshing\" but dismissed the song's rap as \"questionable\"."

The lyrics offer a prayer that the singer's lover be protected until she returns to the singer. The song has elements of country music, and is taken at a brisk pace. Instrumentation includes honky-tonk piano, banjo, bass, violin and drums, the latter of which are played with brushes using just a snare and bass drum. The drummer has a fixated smile throughout the whole song. Joel plays mouth harp during the second instrumental break. Author Ken Bielen sees the song as being influenced by a traditional Irish blessing for an easy return home. Bielen also notes that the song fits with a trend during the period in which religious images were often used in popular songs. Author Hank Bordowitz describes the song as a \"pop-grass on-the-road-again song.\" Bordowitz particularly praises the banjo playing of Eric Weissberg."

Author Ken Bielen notes that \"Parton recognizes the roots music element\" of the song. Bielen notes that Parton's version begins with a slow violin introduction that lasts almost a minute, but the rest of the song goes at \"pedal to the metal\" speed. In addition to the violin, Parton's backing instruments include banjo, dobro, mandolin, guitar and bass guitar.

Mark Beaumont at NME gave the EP a positive review, writing that the four tracks \"eschew any attempt to recreate the breathless brutalities of Doolittle or Surfer Rosa and instead move Pixies boldly on\".

It was uploaded onto YouTube under \"DAVID-O  HKNMUSIC\", a parody account. Shortly after the release of the music video, fans of Davido took to Twitter to belittle the video. They claimed that it wasn't up to par.  Davido told fans to disregard the unauthorized release of the video. Moreover, he told fans that the official music video for \"Skelewu\" would be shot and directed by Moe Musa. Sesan broke his silence in a statement released by his team. He said: \"My attention is drawn toward the chaos surrounding the release of the Skelewu video. I and my team shot the video for Davido in Nigeria and to the best of my knowledge, my client and his team were very happy with the result, when they watched and approved the video. If he has since had a change of heart, that is okay. I am not in any way responsible for the release of the video. I believe Davido and myself did a very good job regarding the video production and as a professional of over 10 years. I find it very irresponsible and immature if my client and his management publicly put out false statements and comments, in an attempt to tarnish my name, credibility and reputation. I remain dedicated, humble, focused and as hard working as ever.\" On  21 October 2013, Davido and HKN Music released the official music video for the song. After the release of the video, Davido received numerous criticism from people who felt that the video resembles the music video to LMFAO's \"Party Rock Anthem\". According to Vanguard, the number of people who disliked the official music video almost equate those who disliked the alternative video. Moe Musa, reacting to fans' condemnation of the official video, said: \"Love  it or hate it, it\u2019s your issue not mine\u2026 All you haters out there are full of s**t, lol.\" There were reports that Davido wasn't pleased with Moe Musa's video and as a result, he was looking forward to shooting another music video with Clarence Peters."

Cudi has stated the album is a prelude to Man on the Moon III: The Chosen, the then-unreleased final installment in his Man on the Moon trilogy of albums, and that it serves as a bridge between Indicud and Man on the Moon III, which was ultimately released in December 2020."

Cudi also revealed he would be producing it alongside his WZRD bandmate Dot da Genius and that frequent collaborator King Chip, would appear on the EP. He then called the EP a prelude to what was originally planned to be his fourth album, Man on the Moon III, and stated that the album would be released in 2015. It was not released that year, however, ultimately being released as his seventh album five years later in 2020. On October 19, 2013, Cudi revealed \"Going to the Ceremony\", a song he had released via online audio distribution platform SoundCloud, earlier in July, would be included in the EP. Cudi would also go on to reveal a remix of his hit single \"Day 'n' Nite\", which was briefly previewed on the intro of his 2008 breakout mixtape A Kid Named Cudi, would also appear on the EP. On November 25, 2013, via his Twitter feed, Cudi revealed the title of the EP to be Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon. On December 16, 2013, Kid Cudi once again used SoundCloud to release \"Satellite Flight\", the EP's title-track. On December 20, 2013, Cudi expressed on Twitter: \"This EP is designed to reclaim my style others have been tryna duplicate for the past 5 years.\" On January 18, 2014, Kid Cudi revealed the EP would be released in February, when he tweeted: \"We all take flight in February.  Get to packin Cud Fam!\". Later that day, Cudi tweeted: \"Satellite Flight: The Journey To Mother Moon is the bridge between Indicud and MOTM3. An experience 6 years in the making.\" He also tweeted: \"Upon the release of the EP, play all my albums back to back starting from MOTM1 (WZRD included) to prepare u for the next chapter, MOTM3\" On January 27, 2014, Kid Cudi revealed on Twitter that Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon, would no longer be an EP, but a full-length studio album instead. Kid Cudi also confirmed the album would still be released in February. On January 31, 2014, in an interview with MTV, Cudi explained he hit such a creative stride when he began to work on the EP, that he decided to just complete a full album instead. During the same interview he stated the album will bridge the gap between Indicud and the third and final installment of the Man on the Moon trilogy of albums, now known as Man on the Moon III: The Chosen: \"It starts where Indicud left off perfectly, and takes you right into MOTM III. It's like a TV show that ends with that cliffhanger. The album ends that way, where you get that one song and before you know it, the song is over and the album is over, but there's a 'to be continued...' There's more to the story.\" Cudi also revealed that the album would first be released to digital retailers and added that the physical copy might contain bonus tracks, or as he called them \"deleted scenes\" or \"flashbacks.\" On February 13, 2014, via his Twitter account, Cudi unveiled the album's official track-listing, as well as the album art, which he designed himself. Cudi also stated that the track-listing is only the \"digital release track listing\" and that \"new jams will be added for the physical, kind of like a extended 'Directors Cut'!\"."

During a show in Dallas, Texas, on October 16, 2013, Cudi announced the new project, which he said would be released in the next three months: \"When I give you the release date, it will be 24 hours before its released,\" Kid Cudi said to the concert crowd. \"You won't know when it's going to happen, but it's definitely going to happen in the next three months.\" On February 24, 2014, offering just a few hours' notice, with propitious tweets such as \"Time to make the world stand still\" and \"1 hour til launch...\", Kid Cudi surprised fans by issuing a new album at midnight. When the album was put up on the iTunes Store, the release date initially read April 29, 2014, which prompted Cudi to tweet: \"The date says April 29, 2014 but thats a glitch. Or is it ;) ALBUM AVAILABLE NOW.\" Upon its release several media outlets compared the albums launch to the respective surprise releases of Jay-Z's Magna Carta Holy Grail (2013), Kanye West's Yeezus (2013), but mostly Beyonc\u00e9's eponymous fifth album (2013). In his February 2014 interview with Complex, Kid Cudi spoke on the comparisons: \"I was like, 'Man, I\u2019m tired of promoting and marketing an album. I just wanna give it. This project isn't something I was planning on doing. I just kinda did it, like, 'Let\u2019s see what happens if I do it this way.'\u201d Cudi noted he already had a release date in mind when Beyonc\u00e9 released her album online without warning: \"I knew I was gonna do it around February\u2014actually January was the target. I wanted to have it around my 30th birthday, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s album came out around December. If I\u2019d had a time machine I would've known, but her stuff was a surprise to all.\" Cudi revealed that while she had beat him to the punch, it showed him that the strategy could pay off: \"At the same time, watching Beyonc\u00e9 drop definitely gave me the confidence and let me know that it could be executed. Like, 'Oh yes! someone was the guinea pig and it worked.' Perfect, now I can try. It\u2019s a beautiful thing that it worked for me because I am not Beyonc\u00e9. Maybe in my wildest dreams on my prettiest day. [Laughs.]\" On March 4, 2014, Kid Cudi appeared on Chelsea Lately, where he was interviewed by Oscar-nominated actress Gabourey Sidibe and promoted Satellite Flight, as well as the 2014 Need for Speed film. On March 15, 2014, Cudi appeared on The Arsenio Hall Show, where he promoted both the album, discussed the state of hip-hop, suicidal thoughts, the Need for Speed film and performed the song \"Internal Bleeding\", from the album."

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 60, which indicates \"mixed or average reviews\", based on 9 reviews. Erin Lowers of Exclaim! gave the album a six out of ten, saying \"Satellite Flight: The Journey to the Mother Moon occupies a space between what is and what's coming, but Kid Cudi's admired originality falls short and is almost lackluster here in comparison to his previous works. For what it is, Satellite Flight is somewhere lost in the galaxy with a few glimmers of light shining on it from other planets.\" Whagle of Consequence of Sound gave the album a D+, saying \"Despite several strong sections, including some of Cudi's best work in years, the album ends up being exactly what he intended it to be \u2013 a bridge between two things. A bridge, however, needs to lean on something stable. It can't stand on its own.\" Jayson Greene, of Pitchfork Media, gave the album a 6.0 and concluded with \"Something surprising happens at the eleventh hour of SATELLITE FLIGHT, however, and it bears mentioning. The sci-fi synths drop away, as does the dead-eyed chest-puffing. Cudi sings\u2014sweetly, modestly, and in tune\u2014over nothing but some guitar, finger-picked with the level of skill that suggests a deep study of Green Day's \"All By Myself\". The song is just two chords, but the voicing is haunting, and as Cudi hums to himself a sweet little melody, he instantly transforms into another possible version of himself: an indie-pop sad-sack troubadour, recording on a bed strewn with K Records 7-inches. Edwin Ortiz of HipHopDX gave the album four out of five stars, saying \"Flaws and all, SATELLITE FLIGHT: The journey to Mother Moon stands as one of Kid Cudi\u2019s biggest accomplishments. Rejuvenated. Recreated. Rebooted. Call it what you will. Scott Mescudi made an EP\u2019s worth of material feel like an album, and he did it without surrendering his artistic integrity in the process. If SATELLITE FLIGHT truly is a bridge between Indicud and Man on the Moon III, fans will be in for a treat when the third installment is finally released.\" Emmanuel C.M. of XXL gave the album an XL, saying \"Kid Cudi regains his powers again with Satellite Flight. It is a dense, short album exhibiting wonderful synths, sharp drums, patent Cudi crooning, mumbles and a dreamy atmosphere. Like all of Cudi's music, it pushes the envelope and it's very abstract. There isn't a gray area with Cudder's music, in fact, it is very black and white, meaning people either are going to hate it or love it. But the journey is always an adventure. Satellite Flight captures Cudi's adventure back home to the moon and does it brilliantly.\" Al Horner of NME gave the album an eight out of ten, saying \"Originally meant as an EP, at 10 tracks Satellite Flight is a leaner record than Indicud and all the better for it. Brave and futuristic, by venturing into space, Mescudi finally steps out of Kanye's shadow \u2013 with not just one small step, but one giant leap.\""

He also plays electric keyboards at times, and the influence of producer Jon Brion \u2013 Mehldau's principal collaborator on the project, though the pianist wrote all the arrangements - was clearly critical\". AllMusic awarded the album 3 stars, and in its review by Robert L. Doerschuk stated \"what intrigues most about Largo in the end is the perspective it offers on Mehldau, whose playing here is, as always, intelligent, perhaps a bit cerebral, and now open as well to sonic exotica\". JazzTimes reviewer Russel Carlson noted \"Even with the added musicians and sounds, Mehldau's piano is, as it should be, the focal point of Largo. His playing remains a little sinister and sad on the CD, but he has also lightened his touch and his melodies and harmonies are refreshingly simpler this time around\"."

'Upgrade your ears' was the tagline of the project, and according to Sony, its principal target was to make the youth generation aware of the different qualities of music that they hear on their headphones. Thereby, \"Naina Chaar\" was recorded as a promotional song for Sony Headphones. Regarding this, Sanjeev Jasani, senior vice-president of OgilvyOne, stated in an interview\u2014 \"We understood early on that no product advertising could achieve our client's objectives. Sony wanted to target music lovers who were listening to music on-the-go. Also, the company observed how closely young music lovers follow their music idols. The power of recommendation commanded by celebrities can be leveraged only when the brand message is not all about pushing products.\" The mission was aimed at presenting a pristine form of music through their vocal and musical abilities, which was beyond the boundaries of the music of Bollywood or filmi music. It was also decided that the singers' collaboration would be recorded in series and presented in the form of an episodic documentary, such that music lovers too could experience the process of composing music. Finally, a web concert featuring both the singers was planned in which the full song would be officially unveiled. Kailash Kher, who has written and composed \"Naina Chaar\", described it as 'a rustic song with earthy lyrics'. Besides the web episodes and web concert, Sony also introduced other engagement activities like quiz on the journeys of both the singers, AR app from Ghoshal and Kher greeting fans and sharing signed photographs and an online voting system for the selection of songs to be performed at the web concert. A new microsite was also launched by Sony for their home audio-video products. In an interview, Sanjeev Jasani commented\u2014 \"Kailash sings at a very high octave and Shreya signs at a lower octave with a much softer voice which helped the project to bring in two different sets of music experience for the ears of the music lovers.\""

Jessica Morris of Jesus Wired rated the album seven-and-a-half stars out of ten, highlighting how \"the powerful vocalist delivers a solid and encouraging album in this highly anticipated release.\" Indicating in an eight out of ten review from Cross Rhythms, Tony Cummings recognizes, \"Maybe Danny covers too many musical bases for some people's tastes but there's no doubting that he is a fine singer and possibly could even crossover to the pop scene with the right song.\" Felicia Abraham, reviewing the album at Charisma, writes, \"Known for his soulful sound, Gokey pushes his vocal boundaries and collaborates with an impressive group of singers and producers [on Hope in Front of Me]\"."

Throughout the video, different singers appear next to him at the microphone - old-fashioned male singers, some Supremes-type singers, and a children's choir. When Walsh is not behind the desk as the DJ, he moves across the foreground of the screen with a guitar. Intercut with these scenes are Walsh playing a couple of \"characters\" like a drummer with backwards ball cap. During the guitar solo, Walsh runs out of the radio station, which collapses behind him, and he finds himself in a field with several searchlights trained on him. In the field, he plays his guitar as the searchlights pan back and forth. The video ends on another searchlight segment as he runs away across the field."

It was produced by Danger Mouse, with additional production from Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The album was announced at an Apple Inc. product launch event and released the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. It was exclusive to iTunes, iTunes Radio, and Beats Music until 13 October 2014, when it received a physical release on Island and Interscope Records. The digital release made the record available to more than 500\u00a0million iTunes customers, for what Apple CEO Tim Cook marketed as \"the largest album release of all time\". After the relatively lukewarm commercial performance of their previous record, No Line on the Horizon (2009), lead singer Bono expressed uncertainty about the band's ability to remain musically relevant. During the five-and-a-half-year gestation period for Songs of Innocence\u2014the longest gap between albums of their career\u2014the group reportedly worked on several projects with multiple producers, including an aborted companion to their previous record called Songs of Ascent. However, they struggled to complete an album to their satisfaction and continually delayed a release. After working with Danger Mouse for two years, the group collaborated with Flood, Epworth, and Tedder to complete Songs of Innocence. Thematically, it revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to musical inspirations Ramones and the Clash. Bono described it as \"the most personal album we've written\". The lead single \"The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)\" was featured in an Apple television advertisement as part of a promotional campaign for the band on which the company reportedly spent US$100\u00a0million. Approximately 81\u00a0million iTunes users listened to the album in its first month of release, 26\u00a0million of whom downloaded the entire record. Songs of Innocence received generally mixed reviews and drew criticism for its digital release; the album was automatically added to users' iTunes accounts, which for many triggered an unprompted download to their electronic devices. Upon its commercial release, Songs of Innocence sold just 101,000 copies in North America and charted for just eight and nine weeks in the US and UK, respectively. The group's press tour for the album was interrupted after Bono was seriously injured in a bicycle accident. The record received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Album. U2 supported the album with the successful Innocence + Experience Tour in 2015, and followed it up with a companion record, Songs of Experience, in 2017."

        "content": "In February 2009, U2 released their 12th studio album, No Line on the Horizon. The album received generally favourable reviews and debuted at number one in more than 30 countries, but its sales of 5\u00a0million units were comparatively low by U2 standards and it did not contain a hit single. Having spent time in Fez, Morocco, recording and absorbing exotic musical influences, the group intended the record to be more experimental than their previous two. However, critics found it to be more conventional than expected. During the five-and-a-half-year gestation period for Songs of Innocence, lead singer Bono expressed uncertainty on several occasions that U2 could remain relevant musically after the relatively lukewarm commercial performance of No Line on the Horizon."

        "content": "Around the release date of No Line on the Horizon, Bono mentioned tentative plans for the group to release a follow-up record of songs from the album's recording sessions called Songs of Ascent. Planned as a sister release to No Line on the Horizon (similar to Zooropas relationship to Achtung Baby), the project was described by Bono as \"a meditative, reflective piece of work\" with the theme of pilgrimage. The band said that the first single was intended to be \"Every Breaking Wave\". However, the project was continually delayed, as U2 struggled to complete an album to their satisfaction and were limited by other commitments; these included the group's U2 360\u00b0 Tour from 2009 to 2011, as well as Bono's and guitarist the Edge's commitment to writing the music and lyrics to the musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, which itself experienced numerous delays and creative changes before its debut in June 2011. In June 2009, Bono said that although the group had nine pieces of music they considered worth pursuing, the album would only be released if its quality surpassed that of No Line on the Horizon. In September, he first made claims that U2 were working on three separate album projects: a \"rocking club album\" comprising material the group previously wrote with producer Rick Rubin but shelved; the songs that he and the Edge had written for Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark; and Songs of Ascent. Bassist Adam Clayton was sceptical about Bono's statements, believing their material to still be in its infancy, while the Edge said he was not sure if the Spider-Man songs would be released as a U2 album or a cast recording, adding: \"The Spider-Man collection is the most developed but the least appropriate to the band. We've got so much material at different stages of completion, it's going to be a nice problem when we've got a few weeks to look at it.\" After the band performed at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in November, Bono and the Edge traveled to the South of France for a two-week songwriting session, followed by a studio session in New York City in December. A December 2009 report indicated that U2 had been working in the studio with the goal of a mid-2010 release. By April 2010, U2's manager Paul McGuinness confirmed the group would not be finished by June, but said that a release \"before the end of the year is increasingly likely.\" In May, Bono was forced to undergo emergency back surgery after suffering a compressed sciatic nerve. The group rescheduled their North American tour dates that year and an appearance at Glastonbury Festival 2010 for the following year, but were able to spend their downtime writing and recording new songs."

        "title": "Songs of Innocence (U2 album)_Sessions with Danger Mouse",
        "content": "In August 2010, new reports emerged regarding U2's multiple album projects, claiming that the band were working on: a traditional rock album produced by Brian \"Danger Mouse\" Burton; a dance-centric album produced by David Guetta, RedOne, and will.i.am; and the meditative material comprising Songs of Ascent. Bono and the Edge continued to express an interest in releasing the songs written for the Spider-Man musical. When the U2 360\u00b0 Tour resumed that month, the group debuted several unreleased tracks live, including \"Every Breaking Wave\". In October 2010, Bono said that U2's new album would be produced by Burton, and that 12 songs had been completed, while McGuinness said it was slated for an early 2011 release. Bono described the music from the sessions with Burton as \"more airborne, more light-footed\". The band continued to make \"great progress\" on the record in January 2011 working with Burton in New York. However, after holding a creative meeting to review their schedule, they realized they would not be able to complete the record that year; their touring commitments limited their availability to work on the album and they had not yet completed the material written during Bono's rehabilitation. In February 2011, McGuinness said that the album was almost complete and had a tentative release date of May 2011, although he noted that Songs of Ascent was no longer the likely title. The Songs of Ascent project ultimately did not come to fruition and has not been released; its evolution and apparent abandonment are examined in the book The Greatest Albums You'll Never Hear. Bassist Adam Clayton said: \"We thought there was more material left over from No Line... we now feel a long way from that material.\" The dance-centric album was ultimately aborted as well; Clayton said: \"The work we did with RedOne was very, very exciting. But again, I'm not sure it was the essence of what U2 is good at... we have to do what we do best and we have to focus on that, and the work we did with Danger Mouse came closest to that.\" Guetta clarified in June that he was not involved in the dance project and had only discussed a possible collaboration with Bono. U2 spent three months in the studio in late 2011, taking a break only for Bono to recuperate from the flu. In June 2012, he appeared on The Late Late Show and said that the group had just concluded its \"best three weeks in the studio since 1979\". In January 2013, the band members said their new album would be released by September and that its working title was 10 Reasons to Exist. Early that year, at Burton's invitation, Swedish singer Lykke Li travelled to Los Angeles to record backing vocals for the song \"The Troubles\" without U2 present. In May, U2 spent time at New York's Electric Lady Studios with Burton, who was completing his mixing duties for the record. After working with the band for two years, Burton was forced to return to his side project Broken Bells. At that point, U2 had a collection of songs that could have been released, but the group were still not satisfied. The Edge said that during mixing: \"we found the songs falling apart. They hadn't full arrived. We'd allowed ourselves to think that 'interesting' was enough.\" The songs, described by Rolling Stone as \"guitar-light, electronics heavy, with uncharacteristically subtle choruses\", were missing what the Edge called \"the hallmarks of [their] work\u2014the big music.\" The band also took to heart advice that Rubin had given them during recording sessions with him in 2006; Rubin pointed out that the group used unique sounds and arrangements to \"disguise the fact that you don't have a song\", and he stressed the importance of songcraft and writing music that could play well even when stripped down to vocals and piano."

        "content": "The group subsequently enlisted Ryan Tedder, Paul Epworth, Declan Gaffney, and long-time collaborator Flood to help them complete the album, hoping their opposing perspectives from Burton would benefit the songs. Flood's time working on the record briefly overlapped with Burton's, and Gaffney served as U2's recording engineer for the entirety of the album sessions, but otherwise the group worked with each producer separately. Tedder initially critiqued in-progress songs and identified which ones were \"worth chasing because [the band] had a limited amount of time\". He compared himself to a music critic in the way he had \"to sit there and tear their songs apart and give [his] honest opinion\". Tedder alternated between working remotely and joining the band in the studio. One of the songs that he changed most was \"Every Breaking Wave\", as he devised a new chorus melody and moved the old one to the song's bridge. As U2 continued to work in the studio in mid-2013 with a target release of December, they were asked by film executive Harvey Weinstein to contribute a song to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The band suspended work on the album to focus on the track \"Ordinary Love\", which was written in honour of Nelson Mandela. It won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Progress on their album was further limited by a period of mourning after Mandela's death, the group's promotional commitments for the film, and the awards ceremonies. In November 2013, Billboard reported that the band's new album had a tentative release date of April 2014, and that it would be announced in a Super Bowl television advertisement. Instead, another new U2 song, the single \"Invisible\", was unveiled in the Super Bowl advertisement in February 2014. The song was released digitally in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono said the track was not the lead single from its pending record but rather a \"sneak preview\u00a0\u2013 to remind people we exist\". With U2 having released two standalone singles written during their sessions with him, Burton admitted in March 2014 that he did not know the fate of the record or if he was even still its producer. That month, Billboard reported that the album and its supporting tour would be pushed back until 2015, which was denied by a spokesperson for the band. The report also stated that U2 had scheduled additional recording sessions with Tedder and Epworth; the band were seen shortly thereafter with Epworth in London and believed to be working at Church Studios. In mid-2014, Li met up with the band in London to re-record her vocals for \"The Troubles\" after they decided to change the song's key. After trying a few different approaches to her vocals, Li said, \"We turned off all the music and sang only to the drums, so it was really getting to what the core of the song meant.\" U2's partnership with Apple Inc. for the album release ultimately imposed a much-needed deadline by which to complete the record. Burton returned to help the group during the final sessions. They spent the final month working with Gaffney in Malibu, California. The Edge said: \"the bulk of it was done pretty quickly at the end. So much was achieved in the last couple of weeks.\" He described the last four days in particular as \"full-on\". The album was completed on 2 September 2014, one week prior to its release. At that point, the band delivered a 10-track version of the album to Apple and opted to exclude the song \"Volcano\", as it was unfinished. However, the group subsequently had a crisis of faith, believing the record sounded \"lopsided\". After convincing Apple to give them a couple more days, the band finished the song and included it on the final version of the album. Over the course of the recording sessions, the band worked on what Bono estimated to be 50 songs. The Edge said they had about 25 songs from which to choose, five of which were still very much in a rough state. Bono said that the songwriting process was humbling, as the group were able to get some songs \"halfway up the hill, three-quarters of the way up the hill. A lot of times, we just couldn't get them up to the top of the hill.\" Speaking about the record's long gestation period, Bono said: \"Rumour has it we haven't made a U2 album in the last five years. We have. We've made several. We just didn't release them because we were waiting for something that would be as good as the best we've ever done.\""

        "title": "Songs of Innocence (U2 album)_Composition",
        "content": "According to music journalist Jon Pareles, Songs of Innocence features U2 strictly playing rock music, particularly arena rock, whose elaborate production \"puts a higher gloss, and sometimes a heavier fuzz tone, on the band's instantly recognizable sound\". Thematically, Songs of Innocence revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as \"the most personal album we've written\". In an interview with Gus Wenner of Rolling Stone, he said, \"Let's try to figure out why we wanted to be in a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeys\u2014first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually.\" He said that he felt challenged to write about more personal themes and why he wanted to be in a rock band after producer Jimmy Iovine told him, \"The person you need to be to make the album that you wanna make is a long way from where you live.\" Rolling Stone deemed Songs of Innocence as having the feeling of a concept album, a notion that Bono rejected, although he did opine it was lyrically cohesive in a way the group's other records were not. For the album, the group revisited adolescent musical influences, such as punk rock band Ramones and electronic music group Kraftwerk, for inspiration. Opening track \"The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)\" pays tribute to Joey Ramone, the Ramones' lead singer who was particularly influential on Bono. During their teenage years, U2 snuck into a Ramones concert, and the experience of watching Joey perform made Bono feel less self-conscious about his own singing. \"Every Breaking Wave\" is about the difficulty of \"giv[ing] yourself completely to another person\", with lyrical characters who are \"addicted to sort of failure and rebirth\". \"California (There Is No End to Love)\" recalls the group's first visit to Los Angeles and how the city contrasted with their native Dublin. \"Song for Someone\" is a love song Bono wrote for his wife Ali Hewson, who he met during their teenage years. \"Iris (Hold Me Close)\" is written about Bono's mother, Iris, who died after suffering a cerebral aneurysm at her father's funeral when Bono was 14 years old. The lyrics liken her influence over her son to a star that died long ago but whose light is still reaching earth. Bono rewrote the song's lyrics after reading a letter that journalist James Foley wrote in captivity to his family prior to his being killed by ISIS; the letters made Bono realize that \"we will all be remembered by the least-profound moments. The simplest moments.\" The lyrics for \"Volcano\" are written from the perspective of a younger Bono addressing his modern-day self; he said, \"It's this young guy going, 'The fuck happened to you?'\" The Edge composed the song's bass intro. \"Raised by Wolves\" is about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, which killed 33 people but were narrowly avoided by Bono that day. The song is written from the perspective of Andy Rowen (brother of Bono's childhood friend Guggi), whose presence at the bombings would later drive him into heroin addiction, a subject also addressed in U2's 1984 song \"Bad\". \"Cedarwood Road\" reminisces about the street in Dublin on which Bono lived during his youth. The cherry blossom tree referenced in the lyrics was from the Rowen family garden. \"Sleep Like a Baby Tonight\", written about a pedophile priest, was described by Qs Tom Doyle as featuring \"deceptively lullaby-like... synth pulses\" reminiscent of Kraftwerk. Their album The Man-Machine was gifted by Bono to Ali when they were dating as teenagers and is name-checked in \"Iris (Hold Me Close)\" in the line, \"But it was you who made me your man/Machine\". \"This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now\" takes musical cues from one of the group's childhood inspirations, the Clash; according to the liner notes, the song is dedicated to the Clash's guitarist/vocalist Joe Strummer. The lyrics were inspired by Bono's realisation that he had found a new family and home in the form of U2, having felt like his childhood house was no longer home after his mother's death. The closing track, \"The Troubles\", was described by Bono as \"an uncomfortable song about domestic violence\". The deluxe editions of the album feature two additional songs. \"Lucifer's Hands\" is based on an instrumental piece titled \"Return of the Stingray Guitar\" that U2 debuted live in 2010 and performed as the opening song at each of their 32 concerts that year. \"The Crystal Ballroom\" is written about the former Dublin nightclub of the same name (later known as McGonagle's) where the band frequently performed in their early years. Lyrically, Bono imagines himself on-stage at the venue witnessing his parents dancing in the audience."

        "content": "The album art for iTunes copies of the album was created by MAD Agency London to resemble white label packaging commonly used for promotional LP record pressings. The artwork, an \"anti-cover design\", is a homage to the vinyl promo release format that was popular during the late 1970s and early 1980s, a period referenced by U2 on the album. Physical copies of the album feature different packaging with a cover image of drummer Larry Mullen Jr. protectively embracing his then-18-year-old son while both are shirtless. The image was taken by photographer Glen Luchford initially as an experiment, but the group thought it worked as a visual metaphor for the album and its theme of \"how holding on to your own innocence is a lot harder than holding on to someone else's\". Bono said, \"With this record we were looking for the raw, naked and personal, to strip everything back.\" According to Bono, the tattoo on Mullen's upper arm is based on Native American mythology of the Pawnee tribe and is a symbol of protecting innocence. The cover parallels those of the band's earlier albums, Boy (1980) and War (1983), which featured the face of a young boy, Peter Rowen, the younger brother of Guggi. The album's title, along with that of the group's 2017 follow-up, Songs of Experience, are taken from William Blake's collection of poems Songs of Innocence and of Experience."

        "content": "In the days leading up to an Apple product launch event on 9 September 2014 in Cupertino, California, rumours circulated that U2 would be involved. A spokesperson for the band denied reports that they would perform at the event or that a new album would come preloaded on the anticipated new iPhone 6 smartphone. During the event, after the unveiling of the new iPhone and Apple Watch, U2 appeared on-stage and performed a new song entitled \"The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)\". Afterwards, Apple CEO Tim Cook joined them to make a surprise announcement that their 13th studio album, Songs of Innocence, had been completed and would be digitally released that day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. Bono called the album \"a gift [from Apple]... to all their music customers\", and said that the group wanted to \"get [the album] to as many people as possible, because that's what our band is all about\". The record was automatically added to the \"purchased\" section of users' iTunes music libraries. It was exclusive to iTunes and the streaming services iTunes Radio and Beats Music until 13 October 2014, when it was physically released and the no-cost promotion within the iTunes Store lapsed. The Edge called the album launch: \"incredibly subversive. It's really punk rock, it's really disruptive.\" Songs of Innocence was made available to more than 500\u00a0million iTunes customers in 119 countries, for what Cook marketed as \"the largest album release of all time\". Bono rejected the notion that U2 had given the album away at no cost, saying: \"We were paid. I don't believe in free music. Music is a sacrament.\" Apple reportedly paid a lump sum to the band and Universal Music Group (UMG) for a five-week exclusivity window in which to distribute Songs of Innocence. According to Billboards estimates, Apple could have paid either US$52\u00a0million to UMG for exclusive rights to the album based on the quantity of downloads, or an upfront fee of about $5\u00a0million excluding royalties. In addition, Apple agreed to a marketing campaign for the album reportedly worth around $100 million, which kicked off with a television advertisement featuring \"The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)\". Apple's partnership with U2 dates back to 2004; in promotion of the band's album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, its first single, \"Vertigo\", was featured in an internationally aired iPod television advertisement, while a U2 iPod and an iTunes-exclusive U2 digital box set were also released. The release of Songs of Innocence drew comparisons to that of two 2013 records: Jay-Z's Magna Carta Holy Grail, which was sponsored by Samsung; and Beyonc\u00e9's self-titled album, which also was released without any prior promotion or notice. To placate physical retailers affected by the digital exclusivity period, Universal offered them a deluxe version of Songs of Innocence that contains four additional songs, along with several acoustic versions of the record's songs. The bonus tracks were exclusive to brick-and-mortar stores and music streaming services for five weeks. The iTunes Store then released the ten deluxe edition tracks under the title Songs of Innocence + on 18 November 2014. Retailers also received catalogue deals that discounted U2's albums in stores by $3 for a period of time. A Grammy Awards spokesperson initially said the album would not be eligible for consideration at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards because it would not have been available for purchase prior to the 30 September eligibility deadline. However, the ruling was reversed after UMG released a limited-edition vinyl pressing of the album to retailers on the cutoff date. The same day as Songs of Innocences digital release, Irish public service broadcaster RT\u00c9 played the record in its entirety on RT\u00c9 2fm. This was in line with a long-standing tradition of U2 giving the station's DJ Dave Fanning the exclusive to play their new albums before any other broadcaster."

Within its first month of release, 81\u00a0million users had listened to it and 26\u00a0million had downloaded the entire record, according to Apple executive Eddy Cue. U2's decision to allow free downloads of Songs of Innocence was questioned by musicians, including the Black Keys' Patrick Carney and Pink Floyd's Nick Mason. Buckcherry guitarist Keith Nelson believed it devalued music, saying U2 had \"sent a message to everyone that music is free, and that's disturbing. It's easy to do that when you're a multi-millionaire-billionaire and money isn't really something that you worry about, but when you're a working rock 'n' roll band and you count on every dollar, it's disappointing to see someone do that.\" The Entertainment Retailers Association reported that UK sales of the band's back catalogue were minimal in the week following the album's release. The organisation's chairman Paul Quirk said: \"This vindicates our view that giving away hundreds of millions of albums simply devalues music and runs the risk of alienating the 60% of the population who are not customers of iTunes ... Giving away music like this is as damaging to the value of music as piracy.\" Many iTunes customers were unhappy that the album was added to their music libraries without their consent. For users with automatic music downloads enabled in iTunes, Songs of Innocence downloaded automatically to their electronic devices. Chris Richards of The Washington Post called the release \"rock-and-roll as dystopian junk mail\". Slate said that it was \"extremely unsettling\" that \"consent and interest are no longer a requisite for owning an album, only corporate prerogative\". Vijith Assar of Wired said, \"The delivery mechanism amounts to nothing more than spam with forced downloads.\" In response to the criticism, Apple created a dedicated page on their website to allow users to delete the album from their iTunes accounts. Bono said he was unaware of the automatic download option. Former U2 manager Paul McGuinness thought the album had been \"positioned wrongly\" and would not have offended anyone had there been a method to opt into receiving it. Describing U2's and Apple's intentions, Bono said: \"We wanted to deliver a pint of milk to people's front porches, but in a few cases it ended up in their fridge, on their cereal. People were like, 'I'm dairy-free.'\" Although he apologized to a fan during a Facebook Q&A session for the album's addition to their music library, publicly he refused to offer an apology, saying, \"It's one of the proudest moments in U2's history.\" Despite the poor press surrounding the release, an independent study of select iOS users by Kantar Group found that in January 2015, 23 percent of music listeners played at least one song by U2, more than any other artist for that month. The study also found that of those who listened to U2 music, 95 percent of them accessed at least one track from Songs of Innocence."

        "content": "In a note on the group's website announcing Songs of Innocence, Bono revealed plans for a follow-up album, Songs of Experience, saying that it \"should be ready soon enough\". After three years of work, U2 released Songs of Experience on 1 December 2017. The album is thematically a collection of letters written by Bono to people and places closest to his heart. The lyrics reflect a \"brush with mortality\" that he had, as well as the shift of global politics in a conservative direction. U2's manager Guy Oseary also indicated that the group had future collaborations with Apple planned dealing with \"how music is heard and innovation\". He said the band wanted to support albums as an \"art form of artwork and lyrics and video content\" that would engage listeners more so than digital audio. In a 29 September 2014 cover story for Time, U2 said they were working with Apple to develop a new digital music format they hoped would sway consumers' interest in purchasing music again. Bono described it as \"an audiovisual interactive format for music that can't be pirated and will bring back album artwork in the most powerful way, where you can play with the lyrics and get behind the songs\". He said the format was 18 months from completion and that the group hoped it would financially benefit lesser-known music artists. A source told Billboard that Bono's use of the word \"format\" was a misnomer, clarifying: \"It's not a new format, but rather a new way to package and present an album. This is focused on creative advances, versus shifts in technology.\" On 8 December 2014, a visual companion to the album, Films of Innocence, was unveiled. Inspired by political murals of Northern Ireland, U2 enlisted 11 urban artists to create their own art films, each interpreting a different song from the album. The artists involved in the collaboration were Robin Rhode, D*Face, Mode 2, Chloe Early, Ganzeer, Vhils, Maser, ROA, DALeast, Todd James, and Oliver Jeffers. The collection of films was made available for purchase on iTunes and Amazon.com."

The group also performed \"Every Breaking Wave\" at the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards. The promotional tour was interrupted when Bono was injured in a \"high energy bicycle accident\" in Central Park on 16 November 2014. He suffered fractures of his shoulder blade, humerus, orbit, and pinky finger, requiring five hours of surgery at NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center's Emergency Department. Bono said he was uncertain that he would ever be able to play guitar again. The injury forced the band to cancel a headlining appearance at KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas, as well as a week-long residency as the musical guest on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The other three members of U2 kept a commitment to perform in Times Square on World AIDS Day on 1 December 2014; Chris Martin of Coldplay and Bruce Springsteen filled in as lead vocalists. U2 returned to The Tonight Show on 8 May 2015, and participated in sketches in which they mocked Bono's bicycle injury and busked in a New York City Subway station in disguise. The group also unveiled a video previewing their Innocence + Experience Tour. To recompense the Los Angeles area for dropping out of KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas, the band performed for 500 fans at the Roxy Theatre in Hollywood on 28 May 2015 while between shows of their arena tour. U2 licensed several tracks from Songs of Innocence for use in the 2015 music video game Rock Band 4; \"Cedarwood Road\" was included with the game, while \"The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)\" and \"California (There Is No End to Love)\" were made available as downloadable content. Chris Milk and his company Vrse produced a 360-degree virtual reality video featuring U2 that was released in October 2015. Presented by Apple Music, the video was promoted in an Apple-branded bus, dubbed \"The Experience Bus\", that was located outside The O2 Arena prior to the band's London concerts on the Innocence + Experience Tour. The bus was equipped with Oculus Rift headsets and Beats Solos headphones for fans to use to view the video. It was also released through Vrse's mobile app. The video combines footage of U2 performing \"Song for Someone\" inside an empty Toronto venue with clips of fans worldwide also playing the song. Production on the project began two months before Apple Music's launch and saw filming take place in 11 countries."

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. At AnyDecentMusic?, which collates reviews from more than 50 media sources, the album scored 6.0 out of 10, based on 28 reviews. Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork criticised Songs of Innocence for \"aim[ing] for a one-size-fits-all, vaguely inspirational tone, with a lean approach to details despite the press kit assertion that it's all 'very, very personal'\". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said U2 \"sounded as impersonal as ever\" and that the album was \"flat and strangely complacent\", while finding the more personal songs derivative of contemporary rock bands such as Imagine Dragons and Airborne Toxic Event. In a review for The Guardian, Caspar Llewellyn Smith wrote that U2 was \"treading old ground without much of a sense of how to move forward.\" Ben Patashnik of NME said only \"Iris\", \"Song for Someone\", and \"Every Breaking Wave\" were \"standouts\", and he criticised the release strategy, judging \"the fact it's free makes it seem cheap.\" Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine deemed the album a thematic success that was \"otherwise marred by the kind of slick MOR pablum that plagued the band's last few efforts\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt U2 did not challenge themselves sonically and that the album represents the contradictions in the band's music: \"They camouflage their nostalgia in the sound of modernity; they play gigantic music about intimacy... They want to be everything to everyone and, in attempting to do so, they've wound up with a record that appeals to a narrow audience\". In a positive review, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph called Songs of Innocence \"fresh and cohesive... an album of big, colourful, attacking rock with fluid melodies, bright anthemic choruses and bold lyrical ideas.\" In Rolling Stone, David Fricke wrote that the record was a \"triumph of dynamic, focused renaissance\" and \"the first time U2 have told their own tales so directly, with the strengths and expression they have accumulated as songwriters and record-makers.\" Spins Carl Wilson said the album's songs were \"more compact and direct, and eschew the global-overmind scale\" of U2's previous material \"for intimate and personal perspectives.\" Wilson praised U2 for hiring contemporary producers to help them \"join rather than beat the 2014 mainstream\". Tom Doyle of Mojo called Songs of Innocence \"the most startlingly fresh, energetic and cohesive U2 album in years,\" praising the personal themes. He felt that the album \"reconnects U2 with the strident, searching, wide awake band of their nascency, reminding not only us, but themselves, of their against-the-odds beginnings\". In The New York Times, Jon Pareles said that he found the record enjoyable for its grandiose musical style and emotionally varied, nostalgic lyrics: \"The songs ground philosophical musings and high-flown imagery in concrete reminiscences and events.\""

Rolling Stone ranked it as the best album of 2014, calling it \"the emotionally raw rock album of the year, at any price\", while suggesting that \"In its range of sounds, there may be no more complete U2 album.\" The selection proved controversial; according to a 2017 biography on Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner entitled Sticky Fingers, Wenner allegedly dictated the ranking due to his friendship with Bono, saying: \"My dictate. By fiat, buddy. That's that.\" The magazine later ranked the album the 93rd-best of the 2010s. Mojo placed the record 33rd on its list of the \"50 Best Albums of 2014\". The Telegraph ranked the record the 14th-best of the year, while Q placed it at number 44 on its list. In contrast, Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times named it the worst release of 2014. For the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, Songs of Innocence was nominated for Best Rock Album."

In the UK, Songs of Innocence sold 15,998 copies in its first week and debuted at number six on the UK Albums Chart, U2's lowest debut in the country in 33 years; it spent only nine weeks on the chart. In the US, the album charted for just eight weeks on the Billboard 200, debuting at number nine and selling 28,000 copies in its first week. According to Nielsen Soundscan, 101,000 copies of the record have been sold in North America, while 66,003 copies sold in the UK through December 2017, according to data from the Official Charts Company. In the band's native Ireland, the album debuted at number two on the Irish Albums Chart. In Canada, the album debuted at number five on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 4,600 copies in its first week before dropping off the chart. Songs of Innocence became U2's first album to not reach number one in Ireland or Canada since The Unforgettable Fire in 1984. The album reached number one in Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain."

Comprising 76 shows over two legs, the tour visited North America from May through July, and Europe from September through December. The band structured their concerts around a loose narrative of \"innocence\" passing into \"experience\", with a fixed set of songs for the first half of each show and a varying second half, separated by an intermission\u2013a first for U2 concerts. The stage spanned the length of the venue floor and comprised three sections: a rectangular segment that illuminated as an \"I\" to represent \"innocence\"; a smaller circular stage that illuminated as an \"e\" to represent \"experience\"; and a walkway between them to represent the transition between the two themes. A  double-sided video screen was suspended above and parallel to the walkway; the structure featured an interior catwalk between the screens, allowing the band members to perform amidst the video projections. U2's sound system was moved to the venue ceilings and arranged in an oval array, in hopes of improving acoustics by evenly distributing sound throughout the arena. In total, the tour grossed $152.2\u00a0million from 1.29\u00a0million tickets sold. The final date of the tour, one of two Paris shows rescheduled due to the 13 November 2015 attacks in the city, was filmed for the video Innocence + Experience: Live in Paris and broadcast on the American television network HBO."

Billboard included it on its list of the 100 music moments that defined the decade, saying: \"The failed strategy showed the perils of embedding music within technology so deeply (and so quasi-literally), and today, most Apple subscribers couldn't tell you a thing about Songs of Innocence besides the backlash.\" Ed Power of The Telegraph labeled the promotion \"the most idiotic launch in rock history\" and attributed it to two factors: the determination of Apple CEO Tim Cook to \"prove himself worthy of the groovy tech guru mantle he had inherited from his far more charismatic predecessor, the late Steve Jobs\", and U2's \"obsess[ion] with being the biggest band in the world\". In a 2019 reassessment of Songs of Innocence, Uproxx critic Steven Hyden said that he had overreacted in his original review and that after revisiting the album, he believed it was the band's best work since Zooropa in 1993. Reflecting on the iTunes release, he still thought it was a misguided idea, blaming it on U2's \"fail[ure] to grasp a fundamental truth of modern consumer culture: People now care way more about their phones than any individual album\". Hyden called it \"the biggest music-related PR disaster of the decade\", but argued that the backlash against U2 was ultimately unwarranted given how media consumption habits changed in the following years: \"technology, along with listener habits, also moved on. Just five years later, the idea of curating a music collection on your phone is kind of quaint for the average listener. In the streaming era, every album appears on your phone, week after week.\" Hyden believed that it was naive of people to criticise the band for potentially heralding in a \"slippery slope\" of \"soft-rock doomsday scenarios\", yet still expect their own listening habits on streaming services such as Spotify or Apple Music to be private: \"As listeners, we freely give this information away, with only faint recognition that this data is also commodified and sold to advertisers and marketers.\""

In terms of musical direction, Im attempted to avoid going for one particular sound as she wanted Heart Beats \"to be an album that people of all generations can listen to, not just the younger generation\". She described the album as having different moods that show who she is as a person and as an artist. The album's opening track \"Super Love\" is an up-tempo dance-pop and synthpop song, with lyrics that represent Im's love for her husband Noah Kim and \"the many other aspects of life that evoke\" love. Jake Cleland of The Vine compared \"Super Love\" to David Guetta's work, Avicii's \"Wake Me Up\" (2013) and Katy Perry's \"Firework\" (2010). The second song \"Gladiator\" is a mid-tempo pop ballad that explores the theme of female empowerment, as Im sings about the need to make a man fall in love with her by fighting for his love \"like a gladiator\". Several critics also compared \"Gladiator\" to Perry's work. The sixth track, \"Speak Up\", is Im's favourite track on the album. It is a ballad that she says \"really explores all the vocal ranges\". Lyrically, the song is about \"speaking out\" and \"showing the world who [she] is as a person\".  The seventh track on Heart Beats is Im's cover version of the 2010 Macy Gray song \"Beauty in the World\". The tenth track \"Heart Beats Again\" was solely written by Im."

In \"Fe Mi\", he pleads for physical love; the song features a guitar riff and rhythmic claps. \"Prick No Get Shoulder\", a metaphor for enjoying life's pleasures with caution, depicts a condition of being. Music critic Michael Kolawole praised Brymo for \"weaving and juxtaposing long-winded cautious narratives about self-responsibility on the track. In \"Dear Child\", Brymo narrates the fickleness of life as well as the unconditional love between a grandmother and her grandchild. \"J\u0119 L\u00e9 O Sinmi\" (Yoruba: Kindergarten) is a memoir of Brymo's past as an innocent child in the daycare to that of a mature man. \"Alone\" is a spoken word track about discovering one's self. \"Never Look Back\" is a compelling charge to owning up and taking responsibility. In \"Jungle Fever\", Brymo sings about the unrest of the populace; the latter part of the song is a metaphor for being angry at the status quo. \"1 Pound\" is an Afrobeat song with trademark horns and meandering guitar licks. \"Again\" is a song about starting love all over again; it is composed of grand drums and a choir like hum."

The single peaked at number two in the chart of the Music Vendor trade paper (within a year renamed Record World) and at number three on the Billboard and Cash Box charts. Billboard ranked \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" the number 1 song of 1963, Although this song was Billboards original number 1 song of that year, later lists from Billboard rank \"Sugar Shack\" by Jimmy Gilmer and the Fireballs as the number 1 song of 1963.

Later releases, beginning with Best of The Beach Boys in 1966, listed Chuck Berry as the songwriter. Later releases list both writers although the copyright has always been owned, since 1963, by Arc Music. Under pressure from Berry's publisher, Wilson's father and manager, Murry Wilson, had given the copyright, including Brian Wilson's lyrics, to Arc Music prior to the release of the single. Despite tensions with Berry at the time, Carl Wilson said the Beach Boys \"ran into Chuck Berry in Copenhagen and he told us he loves 'Surfin' U.S.A.'.\" In 2015, Mike Love stated that \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" was one of many Beach Boys songs he helped write but for which he did not receive credit. Love claimed he wrote the lyrics to the song but was not able to be credited in his successful lawsuit against Wilson and Almo/Irving Music in 1994 because the copyright was owned by Arc Music. In a 1974 radio interview, Brian said \"When we first got going, Mike was a Chuck Berry fan, so ... he and I turned the lyrics into a surfing song.\""

        "content": "The \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" single, backed with \"Shut Down,\" was released under Capitol Records in the United States in March 1963. The song peaked on the Billboard pop chart at number three, the band's first top ten hit therein (see also Surfin' Safari). The B-side charted at number 23. Although the double-sided hit single registered in Billboard as number one in chart points at the end of the year (tabulated up to mid November 1963) and was cited by Billboard as \"best-selling record of the year\", in a low-selling year for singles in the US it apparently did not initially sell a million copies\u2014and has never been issued an RIAA Gold Disc award. The song was re-issued in the U.S. as a single in July 1974 backed with \"The Warmth of the Sun\". That single also hit the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at 36. Cash Box described it as \"a pounding 'Sweet Little Sixteen'-flavored rocker...that the Beach Boys belt out with coin-catching enthusiasm\" and added that it is a \"terrific instrumental showcase.\" In the United Kingdom, the single was released in June 1963. The third single by the band to be issued in the UK, it became the first single to chart. It peaked at 34 (28 in the New Musical Express). In Australia, the single was released in 1963 and peaked at 9, becoming the band's first single to chart in Australia. The single was re-released in Australia in 1974 and again charted, peaking at 66. In Canada and Sweden, the single was released in 1963 and peaked on the charts at 6 in both countries. In July 1963, in the national charts used by Billboard, it peaked at #9 in Hong Kong, #8 in Austria the following month; in August 1964 at #9 for two weeks in Japan."

        "content": "The song was first released on an album as the title track on the band's 1963 album Surfin' U.S.A. In July 1963, a month after the song had been issued as a single in the United States, Capitol issued the Surfin' U.S.A. EP featuring \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" & \"Shut Down\" on the A-side and \"Surfer Girl\" & \"Surfin' Safari\" on the B-side. The EP however, failed to chart. In May, 2003 Capitol again issued the song on an EP along with \"Surfer Girl\", \"Don't Worry, Baby\", and \"The Beach Boys Medley\". However, the record failed to make an impact on the charts. A demo version of the song featuring only Brian Wilson singing and playing piano was released on the 1993 box set, Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys. A different demo version, in which Wilson is joined by drums was released on the 2001 archival release Hawthorne, CA. Both demos feature similar minor lyrical differences from the final recording. The instrumental track of the final recording was also released on the Hawthorne, CA album. This version of the cut does not 'fade out', but continues on well past the original ending of the song until it ends abruptly."

It was first released on The Beach Boys in Concert album. A concert from Anaheim Stadium on July 3, 1976, which featured the song was filmed and produced by Lorne Michaels for a Beach Boys television special which first aired in the United States in August, 1976. The TV special was later released on VHS and DVD as Good Vibrations Tour. In 1980, a live rendition was recorded, though not released until 2002 on the Good Timin': Live at Knebworth England 1980 live album. Footage from the concert was also released on VHS and DVD format. A live version was also released on the band's 1993 box set Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys. The band also performed a live version of the song at the NBC Television Studios in Burbank, California, which was filmed on March 14, 1964. Footage of the concert was later released on the DVD The Lost Concert. The band performed the song on The T.A.M.I. Show which was filmed at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on October 28 and 29, 1964, and featured other top artists of the day such as Chuck Berry, Marvin Gaye, The Supremes, James Brown & The Famous Flames and The Rolling Stones. The concert was released as a film in 1964 featuring the Beach Boys performance. However, after the initial showing of the film Brian insisted that the band's performance be cut from the film. Because of a rights dispute the footage of the Beach Boys' performance does not appear in most versions of The T.A.M.I. Show. The footage was eventually released on the DVD Sights of Summer included with the special 2004 edition of Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys."
