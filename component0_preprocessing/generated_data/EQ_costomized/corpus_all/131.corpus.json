        "content": "Perth () is the capital and largest city of the Australian state of Western Australia (WA). It is the fourth most populous city in Australia and Oceania, with a population of 2.1 million (80% of the state) living in Greater Perth in 2020. Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia, with most of the metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp. The city has expanded outward from the original British settlements on the Swan River, upon which the city's central business district and port of Fremantle are situated. Perth is located on the traditional lands of the Whadjuk Noongar people, where Aboriginal Australians have lived for at least 38,000 years. Captain James Stirling founded Perth in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony. It was named after the city of Perth in Scotland, due to the influence of Stirling's patron Sir George Murray, who had connections with the area. It gained city status in 1856, although the Perth City Council currently governs only a small area around the central business district. The city's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century. It has grown steadily since World War II due to a high net migration rate. Post-war immigrants were predominantly from Britain and Southern Europe, while more recent arrivals have led to a large population of Asian descent. Several mining booms in other parts of Western Australia in the late 20th and early 21st centuries saw Perth become the regional headquarters for large mining operations. Perth contains a number of important public buildings as well as various historic sites. Notable government buildings include Parliament House, Government House, the Supreme Court Buildings and the Perth Mint. The city is served by Fremantle Harbour and Perth Airport. It was a naval base for the Allies during World War II and the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Base West is located on Garden Island. All five of Western Australia's universities are based in Perth. The city has been ranked as one of the world's most liveable cities, and was classified by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network in 2020 as a Beta global city. , Perth is divided into 30 local government areas and consists of more than 350 suburbs. The metropolitan boundaries stretch  from Two Rocks in the north to Singleton in the south, and  east inland to The Lakes. Outside of the central business district, important urban centres within the metropolitan area include Armadale, Fremantle, Joondalup, Midland, and Rockingham. Most of those were originally established as separate settlements and retained a distinct identity after being subsumed into the wider metropolitan area. Mandurah, Western Australia's second-largest city, forms a conurbation with Perth along the coast, though for most purposes it is still considered a separate city."

        "content": "Aboriginal Australians have inhabited the Perth area for at least 38,000 years, as evidenced by archaeological remains at Upper Swan. The Noongar people occupied the southwest corner of Western Australia and lived as hunter-gatherers. The wetlands on the Swan Coastal Plain were particularly important to them, both spiritually (featuring in local mythology) and as a source of food. The Noongar name for Perth is Boorloo. Originally this term (also transcribed as Boorlo or Burrell) applied to Point Fraser in East Perth, and according to Robert Menli Lyon means \"big swamp\". The present-day location of the Perth central business district (CBD) forms part of the traditional territory of the Mooro, a Noongar clan, who at the time of British settlement had Yellagonga as their leader. The Mooro was one of several Noongar clans based around the Swan River, known collectively as the Whadjuk. The Whadjuk themselves were one of a larger group of fourteen tribes that formed the south-west socio-linguistic block known as the Noongar (meaning \"the people\" in their language), also sometimes called the Bibbulmun. On 19 September 2006, the Federal Court of Australia brought down a judgment determining that another judge should make the opinion deciding Noongar native title over the Perth metropolitan area in the case of Bennell v State of Western Australia [2006] FCA 1243. The judgment denied the claim because that application was premised on the existence of a single community throughout the whole claim area."

        "content": "Although the Colony of New South Wales had established a convict-supported settlement at King George's Sound (later Albany) on the south coast of Western Australia in 1826 in response to rumours that the area would be annexed by France, Perth was the first full-scale settlement by Europeans in the western third of the continent. The British colony would be officially designated Western Australia in 1832 but was known informally for many years as the Swan River Colony after the area's major watercourse. On 4 June 1829, newly arriving British colonists had their first view of the mainland, and Western Australia's founding has since been recognised by a public holiday on the first Monday in June each year. Captain James Stirling, aboard Parmelia, said that Perth was \"as beautiful as anything of this kind I had ever witnessed\". On 12 August that year, Helen Dance, wife of the captain of the second ship, Sulphur, cut down a tree to mark the founding of the town. It is clear that Stirling had already selected the name Perth for the capital well before the town was proclaimed, as his proclamation of the colony, read in Fremantle on 18 June 1829, ended \"given under my hand and Seal at Perth this 18th Day of June 1829. James Stirling Lieutenant Governor\". The only contemporary information on the source of the name comes from Fremantle's diary entry for 12 August, which records that they \"named the town Perth according to the wishes of Sir George Murray\". Murray was born in Perth, Scotland, and was in 1829 Secretary of State for the Colonies and Member for Perthshire in the British House of Commons. The town was named after the Scottish Perth, in Murray's honour. Beginning in 1831, hostile encounters between the British settlers and the Noongar people\u00a0\u2013 both large-scale land users, with conflicting land value systems\u00a0\u2013 increased considerably as the colony grew. The hostile encounters between the two groups of people resulted in multiple events, including the murder of settlers (such as Thomas Peel's servant Hugh Nesbitt), the execution of the Whadjuk elder Midgegooroo, the death of his son Yagan in 1833, and the Pinjarra massacre in 1834. The relations between the Noongar people and the Europeans were strained due to these events. Because of the increasing number of buildings in and around Boorloo, the local Whadjuk Noongar people were increasingly restricted in the use of their traditional land. They were forced to camp around prescribed areas, including the swamps and lakes north of the settlement area including Third Swamp, known to them as Boodjamooling. Boodjamooling continued to be a main campsite for the remaining Noongar people in the Perth region and was also used by travellers, itinerants, and homeless people. By the gold-rush days of the 1890s, they were joined by miners who were en route to the goldfields."

        "content": "In 1850, at a time when penal transportation to Australia's eastern colonies had ceased, Western Australia was opened to convicts at the request of farming and business people due to a shortage of labour. Over the next eighteen years, 9,721 convicts arrived in Western Australia aboard 43 ships. Queen Victoria announced the city status of Perth in 1856. Despite this proclamation, Perth was still a quiet town, described in 1870 by a Melbourne journalist as:\"...a quiet little town of some 3000 inhabitants spread out in straggling allotments down to the water's edge, intermingled with gardens and shrubberies and half rural in its aspect ... The main streets are macadamised, but the outlying ones and most of the footpaths retain their native state from the loose sand\u00a0\u2014 the all pervading element of Western Australia\u00a0\u2014 productive of intense glare or much dust in the summer and dissolving into slush during the rainy season.\" With the discovery of gold at Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie in the late 19th century, Western Australia experienced a mining boom, and Perth's population grew from approximately 8,500 in 1881 to 61,000 in 1901."

        "title": "Perth_Federation and beyond",
        "content": "After a referendum in 1900, Western Australia joined the Federation of Australia in 1901. It was the last of the Australian colonies to agree to join the Federation, and it did so only after the other colonies had offered several concessions, including the construction of a transcontinental railway line from Port Augusta in South Australia to Kalgoorlie to link Perth with the eastern states. In 1927, Indigenous people were prohibited from entering large swathes of Perth under penalty of imprisonment, a ban that lasted until 1954. In 1933, two-thirds of Western Australians voted in a referendum to secede from the Australian Federation. However, the state general election held at the same time as the referendum had voted out the incumbent \"pro-independence\" government, replacing it with a government that did not support the independence movement. Respecting the result of the referendum, the new government nonetheless petitioned the Imperial Parliament at Westminster. The House of Commons established a select committee to consider the issue but, after 18 months of negotiations and lobbying, finally refused to consider the matter, declaring that it could not legally grant secession. Perth entered the post-war period with a population of approximately 280,000 and an economy that had not experienced sustained growth since the 1920s. Successive state governments, beginning with the Willcock Labor Government (1936-1945), determined to change this. Planning for post-war economic development was initially driven by Russell Dumas, who as Director of Public Works (1941-1953) drew up plans for Western Australia's major post-war public-works projects, including the raising of the Mundaring and Wellington Dams, the development of the new Perth Airport, and the development of a new industrial zone centred on Kwinana. The advent of the McLarty Liberal Government (1947-1953) saw the emergence of something of a consensus on the need for continuing economic development. Economic growth was fuelled by large-scale public works, the post-war immigration program, and the success that various state governments had in attracting substantial foreign investment into the state, beginning with the construction of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Refinery at Kwinana in 1951\u201352. The result of this economic activity was the rapid growth of the population of Perth and a marked change in its urban design. During the 1950s, Perth actively began to develop along the lines dictated by the rise of the automobile and the suburban sprawl, a development acknowledged by in the Hepburn Report (1957), which noted that Perth was beginning to resemble a pattern of development less in line with the British experience and more in line with North America. This was encouraged by the opening of the Narrows Bridge and the gradual closure of the Perth-Fremantle Tramways. The mining-pastoral boom of the 1960s only accelerated the pace of urban growth in Perth. By 1975 the population of Perth has risen to 825,000. In 1962, Perth received global media attention when city residents lit their house lights and streetlights as American astronaut John Glenn passed overhead while orbiting the earth on Friendship\u00a07. This led to its being nicknamed the \"City of Light\". The city repeated the act as Glenn passed overhead on the Space Shuttle in 1998. Perth's development and relative prosperity, especially since the mid-1960s, has resulted from its role as the main service centre for the state's resource industries, which extract gold, iron ore, nickel, alumina, diamonds, mineral sands, coal, oil, and natural gas. Whilst most mineral and petroleum production takes place elsewhere in the state, the non-base services provide most of the employment and income to the people of Perth."

The Perth Arena is an entertainment and sporting arena in the city link area that has received several architectural awards from institutions such as the Design Institute of Australia, the Australian Institute of Architects, and Colorbond. St Georges Terrace is the area's prominent street, with a large amount of office space in the CBD. Hay Street and Murray Street have most of the retail and entertainment facilities. The city's tallest building is Central Park, the twelfth tallest building in Australia. The CBD until 2012 was the centre of a mining-induced boom, with several commercial and residential projects being built, including Brookfield Place, a  office building for Anglo-Australian mining company BHP."

This water body was known by Aboriginal inhabitants as Derbarl Yerrigan. The city centre and most of the suburbs are on the sandy and relatively flat Swan Coastal Plain, which lies between the Darling Scarp and the Indian Ocean. The soils of this area are quite infertile. Much of Perth was built on the Perth Wetlands, a series of freshwater wetlands running from Herdsman Lake in the west through to Claisebrook Cove in the east. To the east, the city is bordered by a low escarpment called the Darling Scarp. Perth is on generally flat, rolling land, largely due to the high amount of sandy soils and deep bedrock. The Perth metropolitan area has two major river systems, one made up of the Swan and Canning Rivers, and one of the Serpentine and Murray Rivers, which discharge into the Peel Inlet at Mandurah."

At the 2016 Census, 166,965 England-born Perth residents were counted, ahead of even Sydney (151,614), despite the latter having well over twice the population. The ethnic make-up of Perth changed in the second part of the 20th century when significant numbers of continental European immigrants arrived in the city. Prior to this, Perth's population had been almost completely Anglo-Celtic in ethnic origin. As Fremantle was the first landfall in Australia for many migrant ships coming from Europe in the 1950s and 1960s, Perth started to experience a diverse influx of people, including Italians, Greeks, Dutch, Germans, Turks, Croats, and Macedonians. The Italian influence in the Perth and Fremantle area has been substantial, evident in places like the \"Cappuccino strip\" in Fremantle featuring many Italian eateries and shops. In Fremantle, the traditional Italian blessing of the fleet festival is held every year at the start of the fishing season. In Northbridge every December is the San Nicola (Saint Nicholas) Festival, which involves a pageant followed by a concert, predominantly in Italian. Suburbs surrounding the Fremantle area, such as Spearwood and Hamilton Hill, also contain high concentrations of Italians, Croatians, and Portuguese. Perth has also been home to a small Jewish community since 1829 \u00a0\u2013 numbering 5,082 in 2006 \u2013 who have emigrated primarily from Eastern Europe and more recently from South Africa. A more recent wave of arrivals includes White South Africans. South Africans overtook those born in Italy as the fourth-largest foreign group in 2001. By 2016, there were 35,262 South Africans residing in Perth. Many Afrikaners and Anglo-Africans emigrated to Perth during the 1980s and 1990s, with the phrase \"packing for Perth\" becoming associated with South Africans who choose to emigrate abroad, sometimes regardless of the destination. As a result, the city has been described as \"the Australian capital of South Africans in exile\". The reason for Perth's popularity among white South Africans has often been attributed to the location, the vast amount of land, and the slightly warmer climate compared to other large Australian cities\u00a0\u2013 Perth has a Mediterranean climate reminiscent of Cape Town. Since the end of the White Australia policy in 1973, Asia has become an increasingly important source of migrants, with communities from Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Mainland China, and India all now well-established. There were 99,229 persons of Chinese descent in Perth in 2016\u00a0\u2013 5.5% of the city's population. These are supported by the Australian Eurasian Association of Western Australia, which also serves a community of Portuguese-Malacca Eurasian or Kristang immigrants. Middle Eastern immigrants have a presence in Perth. They come from a variety of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, The United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen, and Afghanistan. Perth also has one of the largest Latin American populations in Australia, with Brazilians and Chileans being the largest Latin American groups in Perth. The Indian community includes a substantial number of Parsees who emigrated from Bombay\u00a0\u2013 Perth being the closest Australian city to India\u00a0\u2013 in 2016 those with Indian ancestry accounted for 3.6% of Perth's population. Perth is also home to the largest population of Anglo-Burmese in the world; many settled here following the independence of Burma in 1948 with immigration taking off after 1962. The city is now the cultural hub for Anglo-Burmese worldwide. There is also a substantial Anglo-Indian population in Perth, who also settled in the city following the independence of India. 1.6% of the population, or 31,214 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016."

        "content": "By virtue of its population and role as the administrative centre for business and government, Perth dominates the Western Australian economy, despite the major mining, petroleum, and agricultural export industries being located elsewhere in the state. Perth's function as the state's capital city, its economic base and population size have also created development opportunities for many other businesses oriented to local or more diversified markets. Perth's economy has been changing in favour of the service industries since the 1950s. Although one of the major sets of services it provides is related to the resources industry and, to a lesser extent, agriculture, most people in Perth are not connected to either; they have jobs that provide services to other people in Perth. As a result of Perth's relative geographical isolation, it has never had the necessary conditions to develop significant manufacturing industries other than those serving the immediate needs of its residents, mining, agriculture and some specialised areas, such as, in recent times, niche shipbuilding and maintenance. It was simply cheaper to import all the needed manufactured goods from either the eastern states or overseas. Industrial employment influenced the economic geography of Perth. After WWII, Perth experienced suburban expansion aided by high levels of car ownership. Workforce decentralisation and transport improvements made it possible for the establishment of small-scale manufacturing in the suburbs. Many firms took advantage of relatively cheap land to build spacious, single-storey plants in suburban locations with plentiful parking, easy access and minimal traffic congestion. \"The former close ties of manufacturing with near-central and/or rail-side locations were loosened.\" Industrial estates such as Kwinana, Welshpool and Kewdale were post-war additions contributing to the growth of manufacturing south of the river. The establishment of the Kwinana industrial area was supported by standardisation of the east\u2013west rail gauge linking Perth with eastern Australia. Since the 1950s the area has been dominated by heavy industry, including an oil refinery, steel-rolling mill with a blast furnace, alumina refinery, power station, and a nickel refinery. Another development, also linked with rail standardisation, was in 1968 when the Kewdale Freight Terminal was developed adjacent to the Welshpool industrial area, replacing the former Perth railway yards. With significant population growth post-WWII, employment growth occurred not in manufacturing but in retail and wholesale trade, business services, health, education, community and personal services, and in public administration. Increasingly it was these services sectors, concentrated around the Perth metropolitan area, that provided jobs. Perth has also become a hub of technology-focused startups since the early 2000s that provide a pool of highly skilled jobs to the Perth community. Companies such as Appbot, Agworld, Touchgram, and Healthengine all hail from Perth and have made headlines internationally. Programs like StartupWA and incubators such as Spacecubed and Vocus Upstart are all focused on creating a thriving startup culture in Perth and growing the next generation of Perth-based employers."

There is also one private university, the University of Notre Dame Australia. The University of Western Australia, which was founded in 1911, is renowned as one of Australia's leading research institutions. The university's monumental neo-classical architecture, most of which is carved from white limestone, is a notable tourist destination in the city. It is the only university in the state to be a member of the Group of Eight, as well as the Sandstone universities. It is also the state's only university to have produced a Nobel Laureate: Barry Marshall, who graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1975 and was awarded a joint Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2005 with Robin Warren. Curtin University, previously known as Western Australian Institute of Technology (1966-1986) and Curtin University of Technology (1986-2010), is Western Australia's largest university by student population. Murdoch University was founded in 1973 and incorporates Western Australia's only veterinary school and Australia's only theology programme to be completely integrated into a secular university. Edith Cowan University was established in 1991 from the existing Western Australian College of Advanced Education (WACAE) which itself was formed in the 1970s from the existing Teachers Colleges at Claremont, Churchlands, and Mount Lawley. It incorporates the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA). The University of Notre Dame Australia was established in 1990. Notre Dame was established as a Catholic university with its lead campus in Fremantle and a large campus in Sydney. Its campus is in the west end of Fremantle, using historic port buildings built in the 1890s, giving Notre Dame a distinct European university atmosphere. Colleges of TAFE provide trade and vocational training, including certificate- and diploma-level courses. TAFE began as a system of technical colleges and schools under the Education Department, from which they were separated in the 1980s and ultimately formed into regional colleges. Two are in the Perth metropolitan area: North Metropolitan TAFE (formerly Central Institute of Technology and West Coast Institute of Training); and South Metropolitan TAFE (formerly Polytechnic West and Challenger Institute of Technology)."

Films shot or set in Perth include Japanese Story (2003), These Final Hours (2013), Kill Me Three Times (2014) and Paper Planes (2015). Due to Perth's relative isolation from other Australian cities, overseas performing artists sometimes exclude it from their Australian tour schedules. This isolation, however, has helped foster a strong local music scene, with many local music groups. Famous musical performers from Perth include the late AC/DC frontman Bon Scott, whose heritage-listed grave at Fremantle Cemetery is reportedly the most visited grave in Australia. Perth-born performer and artist Rolf Harris became known by the nickname \"The Boy From Bassendean\". Further notable music acts from Perth include The Triffids, The Scientists, The Drones, Tame Impala, and Karnivool."

Verve Energy operates coal and gas power generation stations, as well as wind farms and other power sources. The physical network is maintained by Western Power, while Synergy, the state's largest energy retailer, sells electricity to residential and business customers. Alinta Energy, which was previously a government owned company, had a monopoly in the domestic gas market since the 1990s. However, in 2013 Kleenheat Gas began operating in the market, allowing consumers to choose their gas retailer. The Water Corporation is the dominant supplier of water, as well as wastewater and drainage services, in Perth and throughout Western Australia. It is also owned by the state government. Perth's water supply has traditionally relied on both groundwater and rain-fed dams. Reduced rainfall in the region over recent decades had greatly lowered inflow to reservoirs and affected groundwater levels. Coupled with the city's relatively high growth rate, this led to concerns that Perth could run out of water in the near future. The Western Australian Government responded by building desalination plants, and introducing mandatory household sprinkler restrictions. The Kwinana Desalination Plant was opened in 2006, and Southern Seawater Desalination Plant at Binningup (on the coast between Mandurah and Bunbury) began operating in 2011. A trial winter (1 June\u00a0\u2013 31 August) sprinkler ban was introduced in 2009 by the State Government, a move which the Government later announced would be made permanent."

        "content": "The county is colloquially referred to as \"The Rebel County\", although uniquely Cork does not have an official motto. This name has 15th-century origins, but from the 20th century the name has been more commonly attributed to the prominent role Cork played in the Irish War of Independence (1919\u20131921) when it was the scene of considerable fighting. In addition, it was an anti-treaty stronghold during the Irish Civil War (1922\u201323). Much of what is now county Cork was once part of the Kingdom of Deas Mumhan (South Munster), anglicised as \"Desmond\", ruled by the MacCarthy M\u00f3r dynasty. After the Norman invasion in the 12th century, the McCarthy clan were pushed westward into what is now West Cork and County Kerry. Dunlough Castle, standing just north of Mizen Head, is one of the oldest castles in Ireland (A.D. 1207). The north and east of Cork were taken by the Hiberno-Norman FitzGerald dynasty, who became the Earls of Desmond. Cork City was given an English Royal Charter in 1318 and for many centuries was an outpost for Old English culture. The Fitzgerald Desmond dynasty was destroyed in the Desmond Rebellions of 1569\u20131573 and 1579\u20131583. Much of county Cork was devastated in the fighting, particularly in the Second Desmond Rebellion. In the aftermath, much of Cork was colonised by English settlers in the Plantation of Munster. In 1491 Cork played a part in the English Wars of the Roses when Perkin Warbeck, a pretender to the English throne who spread the story that he was really Richard of Shrewsbury (one of the Princes in the Tower), landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow King Henry VII of England. The Cork people supported Warbeck because he was Flemish and not English; Cork was the only county in Ireland to join the fight. The mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England, but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed. Cork's nickname of the 'rebel county' (and Cork city's of the 'rebel city') originates in these events. In 1601 the decisive Battle of Kinsale took place in County Cork, which was to lead to English domination of Ireland for centuries. Kinsale had been the scene of a landing of Spanish troops to help Irish rebels in the Nine Years' War (1594\u20131603). When this force was defeated, the rebel hopes for victory in the war were all but ended. County Cork was officially created by a division of the older County Desmond in 1606. In the early 17th century, the townland of Leamcon (near Schull) was a pirate stronghold, and pirates traded easily in Baltimore and Whiddy Island. In the 19th century, Cork was a centre for the Fenians and for the constitutional nationalism of the Irish Parliamentary Party, from 1910 that of the All-for-Ireland Party. The county was a hotbed of guerrilla activity during the Irish War of Independence (1919\u20131921). Three Cork Brigades of the Irish Republican Army operated in the county and another in the city. Prominent actions included the Kilmichael Ambush in November 1920 and the Crossbarry Ambush in March 1921. The activity of IRA flying columns, such as the one under Tom Barry in west Cork, was popularised in the Ken Loach film The Wind That Shakes The Barley. On 11 December 1920, Cork City centre was gutted by fires started by the Black and Tans in reprisal for IRA attacks. Over 300 buildings were destroyed; many other towns and villages around the county, including Fermoy, suffered a similar fate. During the Irish Civil War (1922\u201323), most of the IRA units in Cork sided against the Anglo-Irish Treaty. From July to August 1922 they held the city and county as part of the so-called Munster Republic. However, Cork was taken by troops of the Irish Free State in August 1922 in the Irish Free State offensive, which included both overland and seaborne attacks. For the remainder of the war, the county saw sporadic guerrilla fighting until the Anti-Treaty side called a ceasefire and dumped their arms in May 1923. Michael Collins, a key figure in the War of Independence, was born near Clonakilty and assassinated during the civil war in B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th, both in west Cork."

In winter, Yakutsk instead is between  and  colder than the mildest cities on similar latitudes in Scandinavia. The climate is quite dry, with most of the annual precipitation occurring in the warmest months, due to the intense Siberian High forming around the very cold continental air during the winter.

The city's connection to that highway is only usable by ferry in the summer, or in the dead of winter, by driving directly over the frozen Lena River, since Yakutsk lies entirely on its western bank, and there is no bridge anywhere in the Sakha Republic that crosses the Lena. The river is impassable for long periods of the year when it contains loose ice, when the ice cover is not thick enough to support traffic, or when the water level is too high and the river is turbulent with spring flooding. The highway ends on the eastern bank of Lena in Nizhny Bestyakh (\u041d\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044f\u0445), an urban-type settlement of some four thousand people. Yakutsk is connected with Magadan by the Kolyma Highway. A highway bridge over the Lena in the Okrug had been scheduled to be built by the year 2020. However, as of 2018, no decision to actually build the bridge has been taken. The bridge had originally been planned to be a dual-use railroad and highway bridge so the Amur Yakutsk Mainline, the North\u2013South railroad being extended from the south, could connect the city with the East\u2013West Baikal Amur Mainline. The railroad reached the settlement of Nizhny Bestyakh, on the opposite bank of the Lena from Yakutsk, in November 2011. The new river bridge would be over  long and would be constructed  upriver at Tabaga, where the river narrows and does not create a wide flooded area in spring. In the dead of winter, the frozen Lena River makes for a passable highway for ice truckers using its channel to deliver provisions to far-flung outposts. Yakutsk is also connected to other parts of Russia by Yakutsk Airport. Construction of a road bridge over the River Lena to Yakutsk was approved by president Vladimir Putin on 9 November 2019. Cost of the  bridge and its  of approaches was estimated at 63.7 billion Rubles (83 billion rubles including VAT [\u041d\u0414\u0421]), of which a grant of 54.2 billion Rubles was to be provided, with the remainder to be sourced from investors. The bridge was to be toll-free for cars, with a toll for trucks.

Kublai Khan first sent an envoy to Japan to make the Shogunate acknowledge Khan's suzerainty. The Kamakura shogunate refused. Mongolia repeatedly sent envoys thereafter, each time urging the Shogunate to accept their proposal, but to no avail. In 1274, Kublai Khan mounted an invasion of the northern part of Kyushu with a fleet of 900\u00a0ships and 33,000\u00a0troops, including troops from Goryeo on the Korean Peninsula. This initial invasion was compromised by a combination of incompetence and severe storms. After the invasion attempt of 1274, Japanese samurai built a stone barrier  in length bordering the coast of Hakata Bay in what is now the city of Fukuoka. The wall, 2\u20133 metres in height and having a base width of 3 metres, was constructed between 1276 and 1277, and was excavated in the 1930s. Kublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune of the H\u014dj\u014d clan (1251\u20131284) was the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in 1281, mobilizing 140,000\u00a0soldiers and 4,000\u00a0ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu,  south of the city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion. It was this typhoon that came to be called the Kamikaze (Divine Wind), and was the origin of the term Kamikaze used to indicate suicide attacks by military aviators of the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels during World War II."

        "content": "Fukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, but does experience occasional earthquakes. The most powerful recent earthquake registered a lower 6 of maximum 7 of the Japanese intensity scale and hit at 10:53\u00a0am local time on March 20, 2005, killing one person and injuring more than 400. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Genkai Sea along a yet-undiscovered extension of the Kego fault that runs through the centre of Fukuoka. Genkai island, a part of Nishi-ku, was the most severely damaged by the earthquake and almost all island residents were forced to evacuate. Aftershocks continued intermittently throughout the following weeks as construction crews worked to rebuild damaged buildings throughout the city. Traditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyo and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition, along with several apartment buildings. Insurance payments for damages were estimated at approximately 15.8\u00a0billion yen. A similar quake, with an intensity of 5+, also occurred one month later on April 20, 2005. Fukuoka's major Kego fault runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's \u014cmuta train line, and was previously thought to be  long. It is estimated to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the focus approximately once every 15,000 years. If the focus were located at a depth of , this would translate to an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka if it were the epicenter. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. Including the new extension out into the Genkai Sea, the Kego fault is now thought to be  long. Following reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, several strong aftershocks renewed fears that the quakes might cause the portion of the Kego fault that lies under the city to become active again, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake."

Archaeological excavations in and around Thebes have revealed a Mycenaean settlement and clay tablets written in the Linear B script, indicating the importance of the site in the Bronze Age. Thebes was the largest city of the ancient region of Boeotia and was the leader of the Boeotian confederacy. It was a major rival of ancient Athens, and sided with the Persians during the 480 BC invasion under Xerxes.  Theban forces under the command of Epaminondas ended Spartan hegemony at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC, with the Sacred Band of Thebes, an elite military unit of male lovers celebrated as instrumental there.  Macedonia would rise in power at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, bringing decisive victory to Philip II over an alliance of Thebes and Athens.   Thebes was a major force in Greek history prior to its destruction by Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was the most dominant city-state at the time of the Macedonian conquest of Greece. During the Byzantine period, the city was famous for its silks. The modern city contains an archaeological museum, the remains of the Cadmea (Bronze Age and forward citadel), and scattered ancient remains.

Five main cycles of story may be distinguished: The foundation of the citadel Cadmea by Cadmus, and the growth of the Spartoi or \"Sown Men\" (probably an aetiological myth designed to explain the origin of the Theban nobility which bore that name in historical times). The immolation of Semele and the advent of Dionysus. The building of a \"seven-gated\" wall by Amphion, and the cognate stories of Zethus, Antiope and Dirce. The tale of Laius, whose misdeeds culminated in the tragedy of Oedipus and the wars of the Seven against Thebes and the Epigoni, and the downfall of his house; Laius' pederastic rape of Chrysippus was held by some ancients to have been the first instance of homosexuality among mortals, and may have provided an etiology for the practice of pedagogic pederasty for which Thebes was famous. The exploits of Heracles. The Greeks attributed the foundation of Thebes to Cadmus, a Phoenician king from Tyre (now in Lebanon) and the brother of Queen Europa.

Its attested name forms and relevant terms on tablets found locally or elsewhere include , te-qa-i, understood to be read as *T\u02b0\u0113g\u02b7ai\u032es (Ancient Greek: , Th\u0113bais, i.e. \"at Thebes\", Thebes in the dative-locative case), , te-qa-de, for *T\u02b0\u0113g\u02b7asde (, Th\u0113basde, i.e. \"to Thebes\"), and , te-qa-ja, for *T\u02b0\u0113g\u02b7aja (, Th\u0113baia, i.e. \"Theban woman\"). It seems safe to infer that *T\u02b0\u0113g\u02b7ai was one of the first Greek communities to be drawn together within a fortified city, and that it owed its importance in prehistoric days\u2014as later\u2014to its military strength. Deger-Jalkotzy claimed that the statue base from Kom el-Hetan in Amenhotep III's kingdom (LHIIIA:1) mentions a name similar to Thebes, spelled out quasi-syllabically in hieroglyphs as d-q-e-i-s, and considered to be one of four tj-n3-jj (Danaan?) kingdoms worthy of note (alongside Knossos and Mycenae). *T\u02b0\u0113g\u02b7ai in LHIIIB lost contact with Egypt but gained it with \"Miletus\" (Hittite: Milawata) and \"Cyprus\" (Hittite: Alashija). In the late LHIIIB, according to Palaima, *T\u02b0\u0113g\u02b7ai was able to pull resources from Lamos near Mount Helicon, and from Karystos and Amarynthos on the Greek side of the isle of Euboia. As a fortified community, it attracted attention from the invading Dorians, and the fact of their eventual conquest of Thebes lies behind the stories of the successive legendary attacks on that city. The central position and military security of the city naturally tended to raise it to a commanding position among the Boeotians, and from early days its inhabitants endeavoured to establish a complete supremacy over their kinsmen in the outlying towns. This centralizing policy is as much the cardinal fact of Theban history as the counteracting effort of the smaller towns to resist absorption forms the main chapter of the story of Boeotia. No details of the earlier history of Thebes have been preserved, except that it was governed by a land-holding aristocracy who safeguarded their integrity by rigid statutes about the ownership of property and its transmission over time."

In the late 6th century BC, the Thebans were brought for the first time into hostile contact with the Athenians, who helped the small village of Plataea to maintain its independence against them, and in 506 BC repelled an inroad into Attica. The aversion to Athens best serves to explain the apparently unpatriotic attitude which Thebes displayed during the Persian invasion of Greece (480\u2013479 BC). Though a contingent of 400 was sent to Thermopylae and remained there with Leonidas before being defeated alongside the Spartans, the governing aristocracy soon after joined King Xerxes I of Persia with great readiness and fought zealously on his behalf at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC. The victorious Greeks subsequently punished Thebes by depriving it of the presidency of the Boeotian League and an attempt by the Spartans to expel it from the Delphic amphictyony was only frustrated by the intercession of Athens. In 457 BC Sparta, needing a counterpoise against Athens in central Greece, reversed her policy and reinstated Thebes as the dominant power in Boeotia. The great citadel of Cadmea served this purpose well by holding out as a base of resistance when the Athenians overran and occupied the rest of the country (457\u2013447 BC). In the Peloponnesian War, the Thebans, embittered by the support that Athens gave to the smaller Boeotian towns, and especially to Plataea, which they vainly attempted to reduce in 431 BC, were firm allies of Sparta, which in turn helped them to besiege Plataea and allowed them to destroy the town after its capture in 427 BC. In 424 BC, at the head of the Boeotian levy, they inflicted a severe defeat on an invading force of Athenians at the Battle of Delium, and for the first time displayed the effects of that firm military organization that eventually raised them to predominant power in Greece. After the downfall of Athens at the end of the Peloponnesian War, the Thebans, having learned that Sparta intended to protect the states that Thebes desired to annex, broke off the alliance. In 404 BC, they had urged the complete destruction of Athens; yet, in 403 BC, they secretly supported the restoration of its democracy in order to find in it a counterpoise against Sparta. A few years later, influenced perhaps in part by Persian gold, they formed the nucleus of the league against Sparta. At the Battle of Haliartus (395 BC) and the Battle of Coronea (394 BC), they again proved their rising military capacity by standing their ground against the Spartans. The result of the war was especially disastrous to Thebes, as the general settlement of 387 BC stipulated the complete autonomy of all Greek towns and so withdrew the other Boeotians from its political control. Its power was further curtailed in 382 BC, when a Spartan force occupied the citadel by a treacherous coup de main. Three years later, the Spartan garrison was expelled and a democratic constitution was set up in place of the traditional oligarchy. In the consequent wars with Sparta, the Theban army, trained and led by Epaminondas and Pelopidas, proved itself formidable  (see also: Sacred Band of Thebes). Years of desultory fighting, in which Thebes established its control over all Boeotia, culminated in 371 BC in a remarkable victory over the Spartans at Leuctra. The winners were hailed throughout Greece as champions of the oppressed. They carried their arms into Peloponnesus and at the head of a large coalition, permanently crippled the power of Sparta, in part by freeing many helot slaves, the basis of the Spartan economy. Similar expeditions were sent to Thessaly and Macedon to regulate the affairs of those regions."

        "content": "However, the predominance of Thebes was short-lived, as the states that it protected refused to subject themselves permanently to its control. Thebes renewed rivalry with Athens, who had joined with them in 395 BC in fear of Sparta, but since 387 BC had endeavoured to maintain the balance of power against its ally, prevented the formation of a Theban empire. With the death of Epaminondas at the Battle of Mantinea (362 BC), the city sank again to the position of a secondary power. In the Third Sacred War (356\u2013346 BC) with its neighbor Phocis, Thebes lost its predominance in central Greece. By asking Philip II of Macedon to crush the Phocians, Thebes extended the former's power within dangerous proximity to its frontiers. The revulsion of popular feeling in Thebes was expressed in 338 BC by the orator Demosthenes, who persuaded Thebes to join Athens in a final attempt to bar Philip's advance on Attica. The Theban contingent lost the decisive battle of Chaeronea and along with it every hope of reassuming control over Greece. Philip was content to deprive Thebes of its dominion over Boeotia; but an unsuccessful revolt in 335 BC against his son Alexander the Great while he was campaigning in the north was punished by Alexander and his Greek allies with the destruction of the city (except, according to tradition, the house of the poet Pindar and the temples), and its territory divided between the other Boeotian cities. Moreover, the Thebans themselves were sold into slavery. Alexander spared only priests, leaders of the pro-Macedonian party and descendants of Pindar. The end of Thebes cowed Athens into submission. According to Plutarch, a special Athenian embassy, led by Phocion, an opponent of the anti-Macedonian faction, was able to persuade Alexander to give up his demands for the exile of leaders of the anti-Macedonian party, and most particularly Demosthenes and not sell the people into slavery."

Plutarch, however, writes that Alexander grieved after his excess, granting them any request of favors, and advising they pay attention to the invasion of Asia, and that if he failed, Thebes might once again become the ruling city-state. Although Thebes had traditionally been antagonistic to whichever state led the Greek world, siding with the Persians when they invaded against the Athenian-Spartan alliance, siding with Sparta when Athens seemed omnipotent, and famously derailing the Spartan invasion of Persia by Agesilaus. Alexander's father Philip had been raised in Thebes, albeit as a hostage, and had learnt much of the art of war from Pelopidas. Philip had honoured this fact, always seeking alliances with the Boeotians, even in the lead-up to Chaeronea. Thebes was also revered as the most ancient of Greek cities, with a history of over 1,000 years. Plutarch relates that, during his later conquests, whenever Alexander came across a former Theban, he would attempt to redress his destruction of Thebes with favours to that individual."

In addition to currying favor with the Athenians and many of the Peloponnesian states, Cassander's restoration of Thebes provided him with loyal allies in the Theban exiles who returned to resettle the site. Cassander's plan for rebuilding Thebes called for the various Greek city-states to provide skilled labor and manpower, and ultimately it proved successful. The Athenians, for example, rebuilt much of Thebes' wall. Major contributions were sent from Megalopolis, Messene, and as far away as Sicily and Italy. Despite the restoration, Thebes never regained its former prominence. The death of Cassander in 297 BC created a power vacuum throughout much of Greece, which contributed, in part, to Thebes' besiegement by Demetrius Poliorcetes in 293 BC, and again after a revolt in 292 BC. This last siege was difficult and Demetrius was wounded, but finally he managed to break down the walls and to take the city once more, treating it mildly despite its fierce resistance. The city recovered its autonomy from Demetrius in 287 BC, and became allied with Lysimachus and the Aetolian League."

The first permanent non-indigenous settlers in the area that is now Tehama County were Robert Hasty Thomes, Albert Gallatin Toomes, William George Chard, and Job Francis Dye.  The four men were each given land grants by the government of Mexico in 1844.  Thomes received Rancho Saucos,  Toomes received Rancho Rio de los Molinos, Chard received Rancho Las Flores, and Dye received Rancho Primer Ca\u00f1on o Rio de Los Berrendos.  Later in the same year Josiah Belden received Rancho Barranca Colorado. Famous early figures include Kit Carson, who took part in a fight that gave name to Bloody Island and Battle Creek, Jedediah Smith, John C. Fremont, and William B. Ide, the first and only president of the California Republic. The history of Tehama County includes the January 1886 relocation of Red Bluff's Chinese population, followed by the August 1886 torching of Red Bluff's Chinatown by alleged arsonists. The January 29th, 1886 edition of The Daily Alta detailed 'The Anti-Coolie Move' and confirms that a secret anti-Chinese meeting was convened in the town of Tehama, and an organization established to relocate the estimated 2,000 Chinese in and around Vina. Secret daily anti-Chinese caucuses in Red Bluff were also held."

        "content": "Calais ( ,  , traditionally  , ; ; ) is a city and major ferry port in Northern France in the Pas-de-Calais department, of which it is a subprefecture. Although Calais is by far the largest city in Pas-de-Calais, the department's prefecture is its third-largest city of Arras. The population of the city proper is 73,911; that of the urban area is 128,931 (2017). Calais overlooks the Strait of Dover, the narrowest point in the English Channel, which is only  wide here, and is the closest French town to England.  The White Cliffs of Dover can easily be seen on a clear day from Calais.  Calais is a major port for ferries between France and England, and since 1994, the Channel Tunnel has linked nearby Coquelles to Folkestone by rail. Due to its position, Calais since the Middle Ages has been a major port and a very important centre for transport and trading with England. Calais came under English control after Edward III of England captured the city in 1347, followed by a treaty in 1360 that formally assigned Calais to English rule.  Calais grew into a thriving centre for wool production, and came to be called the \"brightest jewel in the English crown\" owing to its great importance as the gateway for the tin, lead, lace and wool trades (or \"staples\"). Calais remained under English control until its capture by France in 1558. The town was virtually razed to the ground during World War II, when in May 1940, it was a strategic bombing target of the invading German forces who took the town during the siege of Calais.  During World War II, the Germans built massive bunkers along the coast in preparation for launching missiles at England. The old part of the town, Calais proper (known as Calais-Nord), is situated on an artificial island surrounded by canals and harbours. The modern part of the town, St-Pierre, lies to the south and south-east. In the centre of the old town is the Place d'Armes, in which stands the Tour du Guet, or watch-tower, a structure built in the 13th century, which was used as a lighthouse until 1848 when a new lighthouse was built by the port. South east of the Place is the church of Notre-Dame, built during the English occupancy of Calais. Arguably, it is the only church built in the English perpendicular style in all of France. In this church, former French President Charles de Gaulle married his wife, Yvonne Vendroux. South of the Place and opposite the Parc St Pierre is the H\u00f4tel-de-ville (the town hall), and the belfry from the early 20th century. Today, Calais is visited by more than 10\u00a0million annually. Aside from being a key transport hub, Calais is also a notable fishing port and a centre for fish marketing, and some 3,000 people are still employed in the lace industry for which the town is also famed."

        "content": "The early history of habitation in the area is limited. The Romans called the settlement Caletum. Julius Caesar mustered 800 to 1,000 sailing boats, five legions and some 2,000 horses at Calais, due to its strategic position, to attack Britannia. The English could hold on to it for so many centuries because it remained an island surrounded by marshes, and therefore almost impossible to attack from the land.  At some time before the 10th century, it would have been a Dutch-speaking fishing village on a sandy beach backed by pebbles and a creek, with a natural harbour at the west edge of the early medieval estuary of the river Aa. As the pebble and sand ridge extended eastward from Calais, the haven behind it developed into fen, as the estuary progressively filled with silt and peat. Afterwards, canals were cut between Saint-Omer, the trading centre formerly at the head of the estuary, and three places to the west, centre and east on the newly formed coast: respectively Calais, Gravelines and Dunkirk. Calais was improved by the Count of Flanders in 997 and fortified by the Count of Boulogne in 1224. The first document mentioning the existence of this community is the town charter granted by Mathieu d'Alsace, Count of Boulogne, in 1181 to Gerard de Guelders; Calais thus became part of the county of Boulogne. In 1189, Richard the Lionheart is documented to have landed at Calais on his journey to the Third Crusade."

        "content": "English wool trade interests and King Edward III's claims to be heir to the Kingdom of France led to the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy between England and France in 1346, followed by Edward's siege and capture of Calais in 1347. Angered, the English king demanded reprisals against the town's citizens for holding out for so long (\"obstinate defense\") and ordered that the town's population be killed en masse. He agreed, however, to spare them, on condition that six of the principal citizens would come to him, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks, and give themselves up to death. On their arrival he ordered their execution, but pardoned them when his queen, Philippa of Hainault, begged him to spare their lives. This event is commemorated in The Burghers of Calais (Les Bourgeois de Calais), one of the most famous sculptures by Auguste Rodin, erected in the city in 1895. Though sparing the lives of the delegation members, King Edward drove out most of the French inhabitants, and settled the town with English. The municipal charter of Calais, previously granted by the Countess of Artois, was reconfirmed by Edward that year (1347). In 1360 the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny assigned Gu\u00eenes, Marck and Calais\u2014collectively the \"Pale of Calais\"\u2014to English rule in perpetuity, but this assignment was informally and only partially implemented. On 9 February 1363 the town was made a staple port. It remained part of the Diocese of Th\u00e9rouanne from 1379, keeping an ecclesiastical tie with France. The town came to be called the \"brightest jewel in the English crown\" owing to its great importance as the gateway for the tin, lead, cloth and wool trades (or \"staples\"). Its customs revenues amounted at times to a third of the English government's revenue, with wool being the most important element by far. Of its population of about 12,000 people, as many as 5,400 were recorded as having been connected with the wool trade. The governorship or Captaincy of Calais was a lucrative and highly prized public office; the famous Dick Whittington was simultaneously Lord Mayor of the City of London and Mayor of the Staple in 1407. Calais was regarded for many years as being an integral part of the Kingdom of England, with its representatives sitting in the English Parliament. The continued English hold on Calais however depended on expensively maintained fortifications, as the town lacked any natural defences. Maintaining Calais was a costly business that was frequently tested by the forces of France and the Duchy of Burgundy, with the Franco-Burgundian border running nearby. The British historian Geoffrey Elton once remarked \"Calais\u2014expensive and useless\u2014was better lost than kept\". The duration of the English hold over Calais was, to a large extent, the result of the feud between Burgundy and France, under which both sides coveted the town, but preferred to see it in the hands of the English rather than their domestic rivals. The stalemate was broken by the victory of the French crown over Burgundy following Joan of Arc's final battle in the siege of Compi\u00e8gne in 1430, and the later incorporation of the duchy into France."

Following the royal visit, the town's governance was reformed in 1536, aiming to strengthen ties with England. As part of this move, Calais became a parliamentary borough sending burgesses to the House of Commons of the Parliament of England. In September 1552, the English adventurer Thomas Stukley, who had been for some time in the French service, betrayed to the authorities in London some French plans for the capture of Calais, to be followed by a descent upon England. Stukley himself might have been the author of these plans. On 7 January 1558, King Henry II of France sent forces led by Francis, Duke of Guise, who laid siege to Calais. When the French attacked, they were able to surprise the English at the critical strongpoint of Fort Nieulay and the sluice gates, which could have flooded the attackers, remained unopened. The loss was regarded by Queen Mary I of England as a dreadful misfortune. When she heard the news, she reportedly said, \"When I am dead and opened, you shall find 'Philip' [her husband] and 'Calais' lying in my heart.\" The region around Calais, then-known as the Calaisis, was renamed the Pays Reconquis (\"Reconquered Country\") in commemoration of its recovery by the French. Use of the term is reminiscent of the Spanish Reconquista, with which the French were certainly familiar\u2014and, since it occurred in the context of a war with Spain (Philip II of Spain was at the time Queen Mary's consort), might have been intended as a deliberate snub. The town was captured by the Spanish on 24 April 1596 in an invasion mounted from the nearby Spanish Netherlands by Archduke Albert of Austria, but it was returned to France under the Treaty of Vervins in May 1598."

However, during the next century, the port of Calais began to stagnate gradually, as the nearby ports of Boulogne and Dunkirk began to rise and compete. The French revolution at the end of the 18th century did not disturb Calais and no executions took place. In 1805, Calais hosted part of Napoleon's army and invasion fleet for several months before his aborted invasion of Britain. From October to December 1818, the British army used Calais as their departing port to return home after occupying post-Waterloo France. General Murray appointed Sir Manley Power to oversee the evacuation of British troops from France. Cordial relations had been restored by that time and on 3 December the mayor of Calais wrote a letter to Power to express thanks for his \"considerate treatment of the French and of the town of Calais during the embarkation.\" The population in 1847 was 12,580, many of whom were English. It was one of the main ports for British travellers to Europe. In World War I the British Expeditionary Force or BEF arrived in Calais on its way to the nearby frontline cutting through Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Flanders. Calais was a key port for the supply of arms and reinforcements to the Western Front. In the 1930s, the town was known for being a politically socialist stronghold."

        "content": "Calais was virtually razed to the ground during World War II. In May 1940, it was a key objective of the invading German forces and became the scene of a last-ditch defence\u2014the siege of Calais\u2014which diverted a sizable amount of German forces for several days immediately prior to the Battle of Dunkirk. A total of 3,000 British and 800 French troops, assisted by Royal Navy warships, held out from 22 to 27 May 1940 against the 10th Panzer Division. The town was flattened by artillery and precision dive bombing and only 30 of the 3800-strong defending force were evacuated before the town fell. This may have helped Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Allied forces at Dunkirk, as 10th Panzer would have been involved on the Dunkirk perimeter had it not been busy at Calais. Between 26 May and 4 June 1940, some 330,000 Allied troops escaped from the Germans at Dunkirk. During the ensuing German occupation, it became the command post for German forces in the Pas-de-Calais/Flanders region and was very heavily fortified, as it was generally believed by the Germans that the Allies would invade at that point. It was also used as a launch site for V1 flying bombs and for much of the war, the Germans used the region as the site for railway guns used to bombard the south-eastern corner of England. In 1943 they built massive bunkers along the coast in preparation for launching missiles on the southeast of England. Despite heavy preparations for defence against an amphibious assault, the Allied invasion took place well to the west in Normandy on D-Day. Calais was very heavily bombed and shelled in a successful effort to disrupt German communications and persuade them that the Allies would target the Pas-de-Calais for invasion (rather than Normandy). The town, by then largely in ruins, was laid siege to and liberated by General Daniel Spry's 3rd Canadian Infantry Division between 25 September and 1 October 1944. On 27 February 1945 Calais suffered a last bombing raid\u2014this time by British bombers who mistook the town for Dunkirk, which was at that time still occupied by German forces. After the war there was little rebuilding of the historic city and most buildings were modern ones."

        "content": "Since 1999 or earlier, an increasingly large number of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers started to arrive in the vicinity of Calais, living in the Calais jungle, the nickname given to a series of makeshift camps. The people lived there while attempting to enter the United Kingdom by stowing away on lorries, ferries, cars, or trains travelling through the Port of Calais or the Eurotunnel Calais Terminal, or while waiting for their French asylum claims to be processed. The people were a mix of asylum seekers and economic migrants from Darfur, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Eritrea and other underdeveloped or conflict-stricken countries in Africa and Asia. The Calais migrant crisis led to escalating tension between the UK and France in the summer of 2015. The UK blamed France for not doing enough to stop migrants from entering the Channel Tunnel or attempting to scale fences built along the border. The British Prime Minister David Cameron released a statement saying that illegal immigrants would be removed from the UK even if they reached the island. To discourage migrants and refugees from jumping on train shuttles at Calais, the UK government supplied fencing to be installed around the Eurotunnel complex, where the vehicles are loaded onto train shuttles in Calais. On 26 October 2016, French authorities announced that the camp had been cleared. By January 2017, 500\u20131,000 migrants, mostly unaccompanied minors, had returned and were living rough in Calais and there has been a presence ever since."

On a clear day the White cliffs of Dover can be viewed across the channel. Aside from being an important port and boarding point between France and England, it is at the nucleus of many major railway and highway networks and connected by road to Arras, Lens, B\u00e9thune and St. Omer. Dunkirk is located about  to the east. Calais is located  north of the French capital of Paris, or around  by car. The commune of Calais is bordered by the English channel to the north, Sangatte and Coquelles to the west, Coulogne to the south and Marck to the east. The core area of the city is divided into the Old Town area within the old city walls, and the younger suburbs of St. Pierre, which are connected by a boulevard. Calais is part of the C\u00f4te d'Opale (Opal Coast), a cliff-lined section of northern French coast that parallels the white cliffs on the British coast and is part of the same geological formation. It is known for its scenic cliffs such as Cape Blanc Nez and Cape Gris Nez and for its wide area of dunes. Many artists have been inspired by its landscapes, among them the composer Henri Dutilleux, the writers Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens, and the painters J. M. W. Turner, Carolus-Duran, Maurice Boitel and Eug\u00e8ne Boudin. It was the painter  who coined the name for this area in 1911 to describe the distinctive quality of its light. Calais has a temperate oceanic climate (Cfb in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Temperature ranges are moderate and the winters are cool with unstable weather. It rains on average about  per year."

It is the principal ferry crossing point between England and France, with the vast majority of Channel crossings being made between Dover and Calais. Companies operating from Calais include SeaFrance (currently in liquidation), DFDS Seaways, and P&O Ferries. The French end of the Channel Tunnel is situated in the vicinity of Calais, in Coquelles some  to the west of the town. Calais possesses direct rail links to Paris,  to the south. More than 10\u00a0million people visit Calais annually. From medieval times, English companies thrived in Calais. Calais was a particularly important centre in the production and trade of wool and cloth, which outweighed the costs of maintaining the town as part of England. In 1830 some 113 manufacturers were based in Calais and the St Pierre suburbs, the majority of which were English. There are still two major lace factories in Calais with around 700 looms and 3000 employees. The town exports in the early 20th century were lace, chemicals, paper, wines, especially champagne, spirits, hay, straw, wool, potatoes, woven goods, fruit, glass-ware, lace and metal-ware. Principal imports in the early 20th century included cotton and silk goods, coal, iron and steel, petroleum, timber, raw wool, cotton yarn and cork. During the five years 1901\u20131905 the average annual value of exports was \u00a38,388,000 (\u00a36,363,000 in the years 1896\u20131900), of imports \u00a34,145,000 (\u00a33,759,000 in 1896\u20131900). As a fishing port, Calais has several notable fishing markets including Les D\u00e9lices de la Mer and Hu\u00eetri\u00e8re Calaisenne on the Boulevard La Fayette, the latter of which is noted for its oysters, lobster and crabs from Brittany. The Emile Fournier et Fils market on the Rue Mouron sells mainly smoked fish including salmon, trout, herring and halibut."

Like the town hall it is one of the city's most prominent landmarks. It was arguably the only church in the English perpendicular style in France. Much of the current 1400 capacity church dates to 1631\u20131635. It contains elements of Flemish, Gothic, Anglo-Norman and Tudor architecture. In 1691, an 1800 cubic metre cistern was added to the church under orders by Vauban. The church is dedicated to the Virgin, and built in the form of a cross, consisting of a nave and four aisles\u2014 The old grand altar dated to 1628 and was built from Carrara marble wrecked on the coast, during its transit from Genoa to Antwerp. It contained eighteen figures, the two standing on either side of the altar-piece\u2014representing St. Louis and Charlemagne. The organ\u2014of a deep and mellow tone, and highly ornamented by figures in relief\u2014was built at Canterbury sometime around 1700. The pulpit and reading-desk, richly sculptured in oak, is another well-executed piece of ecclesiastical workmanship from St. Omer. The altar-piece, the Assumption, was often attributed to Anthony van Dyck, though in reality it is by Gerard Seghers; whilst the painting over the side altar, once believed to be by Peter Paul Rubens is in fact by Pieter Van Mol. A high and strongly built wall, partaking more of the fortress than a cathedral in its aspect, flanks the building, and protects it from the street where formerly ran the old river, in its course through Calais to the sea. The square, massive Norman tower has three-arched belfry windows on each face, surmounted by corner turrets, and a conically-shaped tower of octagonal proportions, topped again by a short steeple. The tower was a main viewing point for the Anglo-French Survey (1784\u20131790) which linked the Paris Observatory with the Royal Greenwich Observatory using trigonometry. Cross-channel sightings were made of signal lights at Dover Castle and Fairlight, East Sussex. The church was assigned as a historic monument by decree of 10 September 1913, only to have its stained glass smashed during a Zeppelin bombardment on 15 January 1915, falling through the roof. General de Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux on 6 April 1921 at the cathedral. The building experienced extensive damage during World War II, and was partially rebuilt, although much of the old altar and furnishings were not replaced."

Dating from 1229, when Philip I, Count of Boulogne, built the fortifications of Calais, it is one of the oldest monuments of Calais, although the oldest remaining traces date to 1302. It has a height of 35\u201339 metres (sources differ). An earthquake in 1580 split the tower in two, and at one time it threatened to collapse completely. The tower was repaired in 1606, and then had the purpose of serving as a hall to accommodate the merchants of Calais. It was damaged in 1658 when a young stable boy set fire to it, while it was temporarily being used as royal stables during a visit of King Louis XIV. It was not repaired for some 30 years. In 1770, a bell identical to the original bell of 1348 was cast. Due to its height, from the late 17th century it became an important watchout post for the city for centuries until 1905; the last keeper of the tower was forced to leave in 1926. Abraham Chappe (a brother of Ignace Chappe) installed a telegraph office in the tower in 1816 and operated for 32 years. It was this office which announced the death of Napoleon I to the French public in 1821. It also had the dual function as lighthouse with a rotating beacon fuelled by oil from 1818. The lantern was finally replaced by a new lighthouse on 15 October 1848. During the First World War, it served as a military observation post and narrowly missed destruction during World War II. This tower has been classified as a historic monument since 6 November 1931. The Calais Lighthouse (Le phare de Calais) was built in 1848, replacing the old watch tower as the lighthouse of the port. The  tower was electrified in 1883 and automated in 1992. The staircase has 271 steps leading up to the lantern. By day it is easily distinguishable from other coastal lighthouses by its white color and black lantern. The lighthouse was classified as a historical monument on 22 November 2010."

Its purpose of its construction was to fend off would-be invaders, but it wasn't long until the city was successfully invaded by Archduke Albert of Austria on 24 April 1596. Both Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu at one time considered expanding the citadel and Calais into a great walled city for military harbour purposes but the proposals came to nothing. Fort Risban, located on the coast on the Avenue Raymond Poincar\u00e9 at the port entrance, was built by the English to prevent supplies reaching Calais by sea during the siege in November 1346 and continued to be occupied by them until 1558 when Calais was restored to France. In 1596, the fort was captured by the Spanish Netherlands until May 1598 when it was returned to the French following the Treaty of Vervins. It was rebuilt in 1640. Vauban, who visited the fort some time in the 1680s, described it as \"a home for owls, and place to hold the Sabbath\" rather than a fortification. During World War II it served as an air raid shelter. It contains the Lancaster Tower, a name often given to the fort itself. Fort Nieulay, located along the Avenue Roger Salengro originally dated to the 12th or 13th century. During the English invasion in 1346, sluices gates were added as water defences and a fort was built up around it in 1525 on the principle that the people of the fort could defend the town by flooding it. In April and May 1677, Louis XIV and Vauban visited Calais and ordered a complete rebuilding of Fort Nieulay. It was completed in 1679, with the purpose to protect the bridge of Nieulay crossing the Hames River. By 1815 the fort had fallen into a ruined state and it wasn't until 1903 that it was sold and improved by its farmer tenants. The fort was briefly the site of a low-key scuffle with Germans in May 1940."

        "content": "After Indian Removal in the 19th century, European-American settlers rapidly developed cotton plantations along the Mississippi River, which forms the western border. The intensive cultivation depended on the labor of numerous enslaved African Americans; in the early 19th century, more than a million slaves were relocated to the Deep South from the Upper South in a major forced migration. The population of this county quickly became majority black as enslaved workers were brought in to develop plantations. Much of the bottomlands and interior were undeveloped frontier until after the American Civil War. The West Feliciana Railroad was later built to help get the cotton commodity crop to market. Some planters got wealthy during the antebellum years and built fine mansions in the county seat of Woodville, Mississippi. Jane and Samuel Emory Davis moved here in 1812 with their several children, and lived at a plantation near Woodville. Their youngest son, Jefferson Davis, attended the Wilkinson Academy in Woodville for two years before going to Kentucky to another school. After the Civil War, freedmen and planters negotiated new working arrangements. Sharecropping became widespread. Although cotton continued as the commodity crop, a long agricultural depression kept prices low. Following Reconstruction, white violence against blacks increased through the later decades of the 19th century and into the early 20th century. According to 2017 data compiled in Lynching in America (2015-2017), some nine lynchings of African Americans were recorded in Wilkinson County. The peak of population in the county was reached in 1900, after which many blacks left in the Great Migration to the North and Midwest. The county has continued to have a black majority population. In the early 20th century the boll weevil infestation destroyed much of the cotton crops, and mechanization caused a further loss of agricultural jobs. The exit of many African Americans from the state did not change the state's exclusion of African Americans from politics. They were not enabled to vote until after passage of the federal Voting Rights Act in 1965 and its enforcement. Cotton cultivation was revived, but it is produced on a highly mechanized, industrial scale. Southwest Mississippi was an area of continuing white violence against blacks during the Civil Rights Movement. In February 1964, the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan officially formed. Clifton Walker, 37, a married father of five and employee of International Paper Company in Natchez, who was not politically active, was killed in an ambush on Poor House Road near his home. The evidence showed there had been a crowd of shooters on both sides of the road. This lynching cold case has never been solved, although it was among numerous ones that the FBI was investigating since 2007, before the Donald Trump administration ended the effort in 2018. Timber has been harvested and processed in the county as a new commodity crop. The population of the rural county has continued to decline because of lack of jobs. It is still majority African American. Towns have started to develop heritage tourism to attract more visitors."

It was named for French explorer Pierre-Charles Le Sueur, who visited the area in 1700. The settlement of Le Sueur (actually two competing settlements, Le Sueur and Le Sueur City) had sprung up on the east bank of the Minnesota River, both being platted in 1852. The legislature named the combined area as the first county seat. However, its remoteness from most of the county meant hardship for most of the area's residents since the county was covered with dense hardwood forest and existing roads were impassable when wet. Several efforts were made to acquire a more central location. In the early 1870s, Cleveland (established in 1857, inland from the river in the SW part of the county) held a referendum to become the county seat. The referendum passed, but was challenged due to voting irregularities. In 1875 another referendum made Cleveland the county seat (1875-1876). In 1876, another referendum approved moving the seat to the newly created town of Le Sueur Center; the seat was promptly moved there. In the 1870s, businessmen from Waterville gained ownership of a quarter-section of land near the county's center, cleared the timber, and platted the city of Le Sueur Center (1876). The seat was moved there after a county referendum approved it. The county seat has remained in Le Sueur Center (renamed Le Center in 1930) since 1876. The first railroad entered the county in 1867. This began the era of greater access and mobility. The first purpose-built courthouse in Le Sueur Center was constructed in 1896\u20137. It has been extensively remodeled and enlarged two times since."

October 10th: two brothers were chased from their homes by a smaller group of the mob. When Daniel Harrison Jr. was caught, the men burned him to death in the firebox of a steam locomotive. October 11th: his brother John Harrison was caught, shot, and his body stuffed into the hollow trunk of a tree. October 12th: Daniel Harrison Sr. was arrested for harboring the fugitives (his sons) and fatally shooting the deputy who tried to arrest them. At the jail he was kidnapped by the mob, \"butchered like a hog\" with a civil war saber, and had his remains dumped into the jail house privy. Also in the jail that night Jim Good, William Chambers, Edward Warner, and Jeff Hopkins were kidnapped by the same mob and lynched from trees on the Posey County courthouse grounds. Those four men had been indicted as suspects in the rape of three white prostitutes. This was the largest recorded lynching of African Americans in Indiana's history. No one in the mob was prosecuted, and at each court session for the next three years, the prosecutor asked the judge to \"set the case over to the next session\". A grand jury was called to investigate the mob action, but with an election pending for the prosecuting attorney, no one was ever indicted. Following years of research, Posey County judge Jim Redwine wrote a novel, Judge Lynch! (2008), based on the events. Redwine sometimes lectures on the riot, inviting his audience to imagine how they would have acted and stressing the injustice done to the African Americans who were denied the right to a fair trial."

He also established a station near what later became the town of Cascade. During the 1870s, prospectors and miners started searching for gold. The Clara Foltz mines opened on Paddy Flat, and other diggings commenced on Boulder and Gold Fork Creeks. In the late 1870s, the last of the Sheepeater Tribe was removed from Long Valley and Round Valley to a reservation. As the gold sources dwindled, a few of the miners took up squatter's rights. James Horner built a cabin on Clear Creek in 1881, other miners settled on the Payette River. Also in 1888, the first post offices in Valley County were opened at VanWyck, another one opened at Lardo in 1889. That same year Louis McCall and other settlers took squatter's rights on Payette Lake. Their homesteads were the nucleus of what would later become the town of McCall. A freight stop was established at Lardo to service the increased mining activity at Warren Meadows. The 1890 census stated 538 people resided in the VanWyck precinct, and 110 resided in the Alpha precinct. Land survey maps drawn in the 1890s show four schools. The maps also point out sawmills at Warner's Pond and on Gold Fork Creek. A small reservoir near VanWyck can also be seen on them. The 1890s were a period of strife for the new settlers. Ranchers from south of Long Valley annually brought their large herds of cattle to graze in Long Valley. The homesteaders resented the intrusion and retaliated on several occasions by slaughtering the outsiders' cattle. Gold was first discovered in the Thunder Mountain area in 1893, W.H. Dewey began mining on a large scale in 1902. As many as 3,000 miners swarmed into the region. From the 1910s onwards logging became, along with farming and ranching, the economic mainstay of Long Valley. Towns distant from the railroad, such as Alpha, Crawford and Roseberry, soon lost their vitality and died. Towns near the railroad, such as Cascade, Donnelly and McCall, thrived and became the population centers of Valley County."

It was first camp in the United States to offer Project C.O.P.E. The camp is named for Charles Geiger, a St. Joseph physician, who donated land from his boyhood home in 1930.  It replaced Camp Brinton at Agency, Missouri (named for W.E. Brinton who had loaned  for the camp) which had been the Scout council's main summer camp since 1918.  Scouting executive H. Roe Bartle founded the Mic-O-Say organization at Camp Brinton in 1925 while serving as head of the Pony Express council.  Bartle was to found a Mic-O-Say chapter in Kansas City, Missouri when he was transferred to being head of the Heart of America chapter in Kansas City there in 1929.  However the Kansas City chapter also includes Order of the Arrow in its offering at its Camp Naish while having Mic-O-Say exclusively at its other camp\u2014Camp Bartle. In 1930 Geiger announced the donation and in 1935 it opened with a Dining Hall made of native limestone.  In the 1950s, the council bought land higher on the bluffs and further to the north and a \"new Camp Geiger\" was begun with the bulk of the camp moved to the higher land in 1952.  The original swimming pool lower on the bluff was replaced in 1971 with a new pool on top of the bluff. In the late 1970s the Pony Express Council began Project COPE which is aimed at encouraging teamwork, self-confidence, trust, leadership, communication, decision-making, and problem-solving.  It was championed by Pony Express Council Executive Parvin Bishop who expanded the program when he became Director of Program at the National Office. A new Dining Hall and Headquarters/Health Lodge buildings were built in 1992 after land was purchased on the road entering the camp."

It expanded during construction of the Owens Valley aqueduct. The first post office opened in 1910. The Inyokern Elementary School was founded in 1913. The original building was replaced in the mid-1930s by a larger building with a stage and indoor restrooms. This building was demolished in the early 1970s. In the 1930s, half a dozen irrigated farms were scattered around Indian Wells Valley, growing mostly alfalfa and livestock. Community events were held in Inyokern Hall, which still stands. With the onset of World War II, the US Navy located its new Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in Inyokern.  This accounts for the length of the runways and the size of the county airport.  The military base was subsequently moved to the east  and the city of Ridgecrest was established as a commercial support center for that base. Today Inyokern serves as a sparsely-populated bedroom community for workers on the base desiring a more rural lifestyle. The town infrastructure consists of two churches, a post office, market and gas station, convenience store and gas station, a variety store, hardware store, welding and blacksmith shop, a county park, two restaurants, a motel, an autobody shop and several antique shops. In the 1990s the building which formerly housed the library was demolished and replaced by a Senior Citizen's Center.  Inyokern also had a now-closed Kern County Sheriff's Office substation and a Caltrans road maintenance center and a motorcycle shop and blanket store.  The town water and sewer system is managed by the Community Services Center.  The population of the town peaked circa 1988 following a period of expansion on the naval base, but has dwindled since then, and many properties were abandoned during the military downsizing of the 1990s.  Until the 1990s, the main commercial block of the town along highway 178 was a somewhat picturesque street of older buildings constructed of local rock and bricks, including a vintage post office, cafe, three bars, and a small Chinese restaurant.  This street is sometimes used in filming Hollywood westerns.  The Inyokern airport is used to film commercials."

Rugged mountains more than  in elevation west of the area create a pronounced rain-shadow effect, resulting in a shrub-steppe habitat zone with annual rainfall of less than .  The flora of the valley floor consists primarily of Creosote Bush (Larrea tridentata), Burrobush (Ambrosia dumosa), and several varieties of native bunch grasses.  The transition zone of the nearby foothills also contain mixtures of pinyon pine, Joshua tree forests, and concentrated riparian habitat surrounding the small streams descending from the mountain peaks.  Wildlife ranges from black bear, mountain lion, and whitetail deer in the mountain and transition zones to the kangaroo rat and the endangered desert tortoise on the valley floor.  A special note on the local wildlife is the local subspecies of rattlesnake, the Mojave rattlesnake (also called the Mojave green rattlesnake). This snake, which is common in the area, produces  pit viper venom common to the general species but also produces a neuro-toxin that paralyzes the victim within 15 minutes. The subspecies is docile, and fatal bites are rare."

        "content": "The area of San Miguel and the rest of the southern Salinas Valley was inhabited by the Salinans, an Indigenous Californian nation. The Spanish founded the settlement at San Miguel on 25 July 1797, when Ferm\u00edn de Lasu\u00e9n established Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel, under the authority of the Franciscan Order. The site of the mission was specifically chosen due to its proximity to the large number of Salinan villages in the area. The interior of the mission church features murals executed under the direction of the famed artist Esteban Munr\u00e1s in the 1820s. The mission's location between Mission San Luis Obispo and Mission San Antonio de Padua provided a stop on the trip that had previously taken two days. In 1803, the mission reported an Indian population of 908, while its lands grazed 809 cattle, 3,223 sheep, 342 horses and 29 mules. That year's harvest included about 2,186 fanegas of wheat and corn (A fanega was about ). Most of the mission burned, while still being developed, in 1806. It was rebuilt within a year. The Rios-Caledonia Adobe was built in 1835 just south of Mission San Miguel as a home for the overseer of mission lands. On July 15, 1836, following the Mexican secularization of the missions, Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel was acquired by Ygnacio Coronel, a noted Californio ranchero and politician. In 1846, Governor P\u00edo Pico sold Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel for $600 to Petronilo R\u00edos and William Reed. Reed used the Mission as a family residence and a store. In 1848, Reed and his family were murdered, leaving the Mission vacant for a period of time. The Mission was a stopping place for miners coming from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and, consequently, was used as a saloon, dance hall, storeroom and living quarters. In 1859, President James Buchanan returned the mission to the Catholic Church. In 1878, after 38 years without a resident priest, Padre Philip Farrelly became the first pastor of Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel since the secularization. In 1928, Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel and Mission San Antonio de Padua were both returned to the Franciscan Order, which led to their restorations and repairs. The 2003 San Simeon earthquake caused severe damage to the sanctuary at Mission San Miguel. The Catholic Church considered closing the parish due to the extensive damage and the estimated $15 million cost of repair; however, the work has since been completed and the mission has since reopened. In 2011, San Miguel's local business community formed the San Miguel Chamber of Commerce in order to promote the village's tourism and agricultural industries."

The town population was 8 at the 2010 United States Census, making Lakeside the least populous municipality in the State of Colorado.  Lakeside is immediately west of the City and County of Denver, the most populous municipality in the state.  The Denver Post Office (ZIP Code 80212) serves Lakeside. The town's namesake lake is Lake Rhoda, which covers 20% of its total area. A year after its incorporation on November 12, 1907, the Lakeside Amusement Park, nicknamed \"White City\", opened on the eastern shores.  Both town and park were founded by a syndicate led by prominent Denver brewer Adolph Zang, who endeavored to build the resort just across the county line from Denver, and incorporated to move beyond the reach of Denver liquor laws. A shopping mall, Lakeside Center, was built in 1956 on the southern shore, but fell into financial troubles due to lack of business around the turn of the century and was converted into a Wal-Mart and strip mall circa 2010. The amusement park, shopping area, and lake occupy almost all of the tiny municipality.  Residences are limited to a handful of houses in the southeast corner of the town occupied by employees of the amusement park."

The Mississippian culture was known for building earthen platform mounds; in the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, the people developed some large, dense cities and complexes featuring multiple mounds and, in some cases, thousands of residents. In what is known as the regional South Appalachian Mississippian culture, by contrast, settlements were smaller and the peoples typically built a single platform mound in the larger villages. Salvage archeological studies were conducted by Dr. Joseph Caldwell of the University of Georgia in 1957, prior to flooding of this area after construction of a dam downriver. He determined the first settlement was founded about 800 CE and lasted to 1700, when the village was burned. By that time, it was occupied by proto-Creek who were descendants of the Mississippians. Colonial maps until the American Revolution identified this village as one of the Hogeloge people (now known as Yuchi). While they later became allies of the Cherokee, they were of a different ethnicity and language group."

        "content": "European Americans did not settle here until after the American Revolutionary War, when the government gave land grants in lieu of pay owed to veterans. A group led by Col. William H. Wofford moved to the area when the war ended. It became known as Wofford's Tract, or Wofford's Settlement. Col. Wofford is buried near Toccoa Falls. His son, William T. Wofford, was born near Toccoa (then part of Habersham County). Travelers had to rely on using fords, and later ferries, to get across the Tugaloo River. The first Prather's Bridge was a swinging bridge built in 1804 by James Jeremiah Prather. The first bridge was washed away during a freshet (an overflow caused by heavy rain). Georgia conducted a Land Lottery of 1820, although the Cherokee had not yet ceded this area to the United States. Scots-Irish who acquired land in the lottery moved to this area from the backcountry of North Carolina and the Georgia coast. The Georgia Gold Rush, starting in 1828, also attracted many new settlers to North Georgia. European Americans pressed the government to take over the land of the Five Civilized Tribes, seeking cheaper land to develop for cotton plantations. Short-staple cotton, which could be grown in the uplands through this area, had become profitable since the invention of the cotton gin for processing it. At the urging of President Andrew Jackson, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, authorizing the government to force cessions of land by Southeast tribes in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River, in what became known as Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). The 1838 removal of the Cherokee on the infamous \"Trail of Tears\" extinguished most of their land claims to this area. The US government released former Cherokee and Creek (Muscogee) lands for sale and settlement by European Americans in Georgia. Toccoa means \"beautiful\" in the Cherokee language; it is derived from the Cherokee term for \"where the Catawbas lived.\" A more substantial bridge was built across the Tugaloo River in 1850. That year James D. Prather supervised the construction of his plantation house known as Riverside, on a hill overlooking the upper Tugalo River. The Greek revival antebellum house was built by his enslaved African-American workers, and the timber for the house was harvested from his plantation. The Prather family cemetery was developed to the right of the house. During the Civil War, General Robert Toombs, a close friend of Prather, used this house as a refuge from Union troops. The soldiers pursued him to Riverside, but he hid and escaped capture. The Prather Bridge was burned in 1863 by Confederate troops during the Civil War to keep the Union enemy from crossing. James Jeremiah Prather and his son, James Devereaux Prather, rebuilt the bridge in 1868. This bridge lasted until 1918, when it was washed away. It was rebuilt in 1920 by James D. Prather. It was afterward replaced by a concrete bridge, but the wooden bridge was kept as a landmark. Vandals burned it down in 1978. According to historical accounts, the Johns House, a Victorian cottage near Prather Bridge Road, was built in 1898. When the Georgia General Assembly created Stephens County in 1905, Toccoa was established as the county seat. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt visited Toccoa on March 23, 1938 during the Great Depression. Roosevelt's train made a brief stop there, and he made remarks from the rear platform of the presidential train. He traveled to Gainesville to deliver a major speech, and finished at Warm Springs for a vacation. Camp Toccoa was developed nearby as a World War II paratrooper training base. It was the first training base for the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the Army's 101st Airborne Division. Its Easy Company was subject of the non-fiction book and an HBO miniseries adaptation of the same name: Band of Brothers. Traveler's Rest, an antebellum 19th-century inn, known locally as Jarrett Manor, is located outside Toccoa. It stands near Lake Hartwell, which was creating by flooding an area of the Tugaloo River after completion of the Hartwell Dam in 1962. The inn has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. Toccoa is home of Toccoa Falls College. On November 6, 1977, the earthen Kelly Barnes Dam failed upriver from the college. The resulting flood killed 39. First Lady Rosalynn Carter visited Toccoa the next day. Toccoa Falls is located on the campus of the college. The short 100-yard path to the base of the 186-foot (57 m) high natural waterfall is handicap accessible."

Camp Toccoa was located just outside the city proper, at the foot of Currahee Mountain, and was formerly known as Camp Toombs. The museum houses the original Aldbourne stables where paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division were housed temporarily in England in 1944. Only one building remains of the original Camp Toccoa (the building is believed to be a former food supply storage facility, based on its position near the former camp's gates and the foundation's construction), and it was donated to the museum in 2011 by the Milliken company, which was using it as a machine shop. The museum intends to restore the building, along with the surrounding grounds."

The clock at the spire of the courthouse was restored to operational condition in 2010 as part of an overall renovation of the building, and is the highlight of the historic district which features several buildings from the American Civil War period. The Toccoa Casket Company, now out of business, was the largest supplier of caskets to the military until Vietnam. Its building, located on the main road leading into Toccoa from the south, on the route from Toccoa to Currahee Mountain, was razed in 2014. Toccoa also has a thriving classic car culture, as evidenced by frequent car shows. In addition, classic cars from the late 1920s through the 1970s can easily be spotted on the roads and in parking lots.

        "content": "Downtown Toccoa is located near the courthouse and the train depot, which connects to Atlanta. From the 1950s through 1980s, business bustled in this \"mall.\" Each day people would flood to shop in downtown Toccoa. Several national retail outlets were then located in downtown Toccoa, including the Belk Gallant department store. In the early 1960s, around the country, local downtown businesses faced competition with large shopping malls, and many began to fail.  As an answer to the depressed conditions in downtowns, Toccoa and many other towns erected concrete canopies and closed streets to create a pedestrian mall. In less than ten years it was evident that instead of enhancing businesses and creating a positive downtown image, these canopies actually accelerated the downtown's decline. When the Belk Gallant department store announced it was going to move along a four lane road called Big A, community leaders organized Main Street Toccoa in 1990. In 1991, the Georgia Department of Community Affairs Resource Team recommended that the canopies be removed and that the street be opened once again to vehicular traffic. However, for many years the project was not supported. During that time, Main Street Toccoa implemented many changes and improvements to the downtown mall area. Brick pavers were installed and trees were planted. However, the canopies themselves began to deteriorate, and no support was found to repair them. During this time, businesses continued to flounder and many of the buildings were empty and in disrepair. Over time, however, with growing support, approval was given to start the canopy removal project. Efforts that helped contribute community support for the project included county-wide public surveys, a University of Georgia market study, a UGA design charrette, and renderings of individual buildings without the canopies provided by the GA Trust for Historic Preservation and UGA Community Design Planning and Preservation. To gather the necessary funds for the project, Toccoa partnered with six state agencies (Appalachian Regional Commission, Georgia Department of Community Affairs, One Georgia Authority, United States Department of Agriculture, and Georgia Department of Transportation) that provided $1.3 million, with additional local funding of $552,000. During the canopy removal and street re-opening project, private interest in downtown increased. In 2008, downtown saw 33 storefronts renovated (under the guidance of the Georgia Mountains Regional Development Center Historic Preservation Planner), 11 new business, 17 new jobs, 28 part-time jobs and 68 full-time equivalent jobs retained, and private investment of $3.5 million. Toccoa's Main Street was re-opened to vehicular traffic. The Currahee Military Museum, featured recently in the PBS series GA Traveler, and named as one of the best museums along the East Coast by Blue Ridge Mountain Magazine, is another attraction that continues downtown's resurgence. Located in the restored historic train depot, the museum features a massive exhibit of 506's Easy Company memorabilia. This World War II paratrooper company was popularized by the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers. The depot housing this museum was recently restored to its pre-1940s appearance.  The depot building had previously been used as a maintenance and storage area for Norfolk Southern. Now it has been transformed to a publicly owned building that is home to the Chamber, Welcome Center, Stephens County Historical Society Museum, the Currahee Military Museum, and Amtrak. Funding for the million dollar project was received through Transportation Enhancement Activity and GDOT funds of $400,000; local funding of $100,000 and private investment funds of over $500,000 were contributed. The museum just completed its second addition, funded by Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST). Enhancing Toccoa as a Northeast Georgia destination is the newly restored courthouse, which anchors the downtown district. The renovation project was overseen by a governmental appointed citizen authority.  Funded entirely by SPLOST dollars, the $2\u00a0million renovation project brought a historic 1907 building back to life while adding green space to the historic district and retained government offices and downtown customers in the city's square."

It is directly across the Mississippi River from Downtown St. Louis, Missouri and the Gateway Arch National Park. It is a suburb of St. Louis. East St. Louis is in the Metro-East region of Southern Illinois. Once a bustling industrial center, like many cities in the Rust Belt, East St. Louis was severely affected by the loss of jobs due to industrial restructuring during the second half of the 20th century. In 1950, East St. Louis was the fourth-largest city in Illinois when its population peaked at 82,366. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 18,469, less than one-quarter of the 1950 census and a decline of almost one third since 2010. A recent addition to the city's waterfront is the Gateway Geyser. On the grounds of Malcolm W. Martin Memorial Park, the fountain is the second-tallest in the world.

        "content": "Native Americans had long inhabited both sides of the Mississippi River. The Mississippian culture rulers organized thousands of workers to construct complex earthwork mounds at what later became St. Louis and East St. Louis. The center of this culture was the urban complex of Cahokia, located to the north of present-day East St. Louis within Collinsville, Illinois. Before the Civil War, settlers reported up to 50 mounds in the area that became East St. Louis, but most were lost to 19th-century development and later roadbuilding. East St. Louis lies within the fertile American Bottom area of the present day Metro-East area of St. Louis, Missouri. This name was given after the United States acquired the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, and more European Americans began to settle in the area. The village was first named \"Illinoistown\". East St. Louis was founded in 1797 by Captain James Piggott, a Revolutionary War veteran. In that year Piggott began operating a ferry service across the Mississippi River, connecting Illinoistown with St. Louis, which had been founded by ethnic French families. When Piggott died in 1799, his widow sold the ferry business, moved to St. Louis County and remarried. One of the Piggotts' great-great-granddaughters became known as actress Virginia Mayo (Virginia Clara Jones). The municipality called East St. Louis was established on April 1, 1861. Illinoistown residents voted on a new name that day, and 183 voted to rename the town East St. Louis. Though it started as a small town, East St. Louis soon grew to a larger city, influenced by the growing economy of St. Louis, which in 1870 was the fourth-largest city in the United States."

        "title": "East St. Louis, Illinois_Great Railroad Strike of 1877",
        "content": "A period of extensive industrial growth followed the American Civil War. Industries in East St. Louis made use of the local availability of Illinois coal as fuel. Another early industry was meatpacking and stockyards, concentrated in one area to limit their nuisance to other jurisdictions. In the expansion, many businessmen became overextended in credit, and a major economic collapse followed the Panic of 1873. This was due to railroad and other manufacturing expansion, land speculation, and general business optimism caused by large profits from inflation. The economic recession began in the East and steadily moved West, severely crippling the railroads, the main system of transportation. In response, railroad companies began dramatically lowering workers' wages, forcing employees to work without pay, and cutting jobs and paid work hours. These wage cuts and additional money-saving tactics prompted strikes and massive unrest. While most of the strikes in the eastern cities during 1877 were accompanied by violence, the late July 1877 St. Louis strike was marked by a bloodless and quick take-over by dissatisfied workers. By July 22, the St. Louis Commune began to take shape, as representatives from almost all the railroad lines met in East St. Louis. They soon elected an executive committee to command the strike and issued General Order No. 1, halting all railroad traffic other than passenger and mail trains.  John Bowman, the mayor of East St. Louis, was appointed arbitrator of the committee. He helped the committee select special police to guard the property of the railroads from damage. The strike and the new de facto workers' government, while given encouragement by the largely German-American Workingmen's Party and the Knights of Labor (two key players in the organization of the Missouri general strike), were run by no organized labor group. The strike also closed packing industry houses surrounding the National Stock Yards. At one plant, workers allowed processing of 125 cattle in return for 500 cans of beef for the workers. Though the East St. Louis strike continued in an orderly fashion, across the river in St. Louis there were isolated incidents of violence. Harry Eastman, the East St. Louis workers' representative, addressed the mass of employees: Go home to your different wards and organize your different unions, but don't keep coming up here in great bodies and stirring up excitement. Ask the Mayor, as we did, to close up all the saloons... keep sober and orderly, and when you are organized, apply to the United Workingmen for orders. Don't plunder ... don't interfere with the railroads here ... let us attend to that. The strikers held the railroads and city for about a week, without the violence that took place in Chicago and other cities.  The federal government intervened, and on July 28 US troops took over the Relay Depot, the Commune's command center, and the strike ended peacefully."

        "content": "East St. Louis in 1917 had a strong industrial economy boosted by America's economic participation in demands related to World War I; although war was declared in April, the nation did not meaningfully enter the war until that fall. Industry was dominated by European immigrant workers, who had been coming to industrial cities since the late 19th century. Here and across the country, they repeatedly tried to organize in efforts to gain better wages and working conditions. In the summer of 1916, 2,500 white workers struck the nearby meat packing plants of National City. Companies recruited black workers, sometimes importing them from the South. While the white workers won a wage increase, the companies retained some black workers, firing white ones. Such economic competition raised tensions between the groups in a period when the number of blacks in East St. Louis had increased dramatically due to the first Great Migration, when African Americans left poor rural areas of the South to escape Jim Crow oppression and seek jobs in the industrial cities of the North and the Midwest. From 1910 to 1917, the black population nearly doubled in East St. Louis. The United States established a draft which would bring in many workers to the military. As the war prevented immigration from Europe even before the U.S. entered the war, major companies had begun to recruit black workers from the South to fill demand. When white workers went on strike in April 1917 at the Aluminum Ore Company, the employer hired blacks as strikebreakers. The American Steel Company also recruited blacks. They were available in part during this period because the U.S. Army initially rejected many black volunteers in the years before an integrated military. This was also the period of resentment on both sides and the arrival of new workers created fears for job security at a time of union organizing and labor unrest, and raised social tensions. At a large labor meeting of white workers held in City Hall on May 28, men also traded rumors of fraternizing between black men and white women. An inflammatory speaker said, \u201cEast St. Louis must remain a white man\u2019s town.\u201d Three thousand ethnic white men left the meeting and headed as a mob for downtown, where they randomly attacked black men on the street. The Illinois governor called in National Guard to prevent further rioting, but rumors circulated that blacks were planning an organized retaliation and tensions remained high. On July 1, 1917, a black man attacked a white man. After hearing of this, whites drove by black homes near 17th and Market and fired shots into several of them. When police came to investigate a gathering of a large group of local black residents, their car was mistaken for that of the attackers, and several in the crowd at 10th and Bond fired on the police, killing two detectives. The next morning, thousands of whites mobbed the black sections of the city, indiscriminately beating, shooting and killing men, women and children. The rioters burned entire sections of the city and shot blacks as they escaped the flames. They also hanged several blacks. They destroyed buildings and physically attacked people; they \"killed a 14-year-old boy and scalped his mother. Before it was over 244 buildings were destroyed.\". Other sources say 300 buildings were destroyed. The city had 35 police officers, but they were seen to be doing little to suppress the violence. The governor called in National Guard troops to try to control the situation; they arrived July 3, but several accounts reported that they joined in the rioting. Most of the violence ended that day, but reports continued afterward of isolated assaults of blacks. Afterward the city Chamber of Commerce called for the resignation of the Police Chief and greater oversight of police operations. Losses in property damage were high, including railroad warehouses and carloads full of goods that were burned, as well as railroad cars. Though official reports suggested that the East St. Louis race riot resulted in the deaths of 39 blacks and 9 whites, other estimates put the figure much higher, with estimates of 100 to 250 blacks being killed. W. E. B. Du Bois of the NAACP came to investigate the riots personally. His organization's photographer published photos of the destruction in the November issue of The Crisis. Congress also held an investigation. In New York City on July 28, 10,000 black people marched down Fifth Avenue in a Silent Parade, carrying signs and protesting the East St. Louis riots. The march was organized by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), W. E. B. Du Bois, and groups in Harlem. Women and children were dressed in white; the men were dressed in black."

        "content": "East St. Louis continued to have an economy based on industry. Through and after World War II, many workers could make decent livings. It was named an All-America City in 1959 by the National Civic League. East St. Louis celebrated its centennial in 1961. It was known as the \"Pittsburgh of the West.\" Its population had reached a peak of 82,366 residents in the 1950 census, the fourth-largest city in Illinois at the time. Through the 1950s and later, the city's musicians were an integral creative force in blues, rock and roll and jazz. Some left and achieved national recognition, such as Ike & Tina Turner. The jazz great Miles Davis, who became internationally known, was born in nearby Alton and grew up in East St. Louis. The 1999 PBS series River of Song featured these musicians in its coverage of music from cities along the Mississippi River. The city suffered from the mid-century restructuring of heavy industry and railroads, which cost widespread loss of jobs. As a number of local factories began to close because of changes in industry, the railroad and meatpacking industries also were cutting back and moving jobs out of the region. This led to a precipitous loss of working and middle-class jobs. The city's financial conditions deteriorated. Elected in 1951, Mayor Alvin Fields tried funding measures that resulted in raising the city's bonded indebtedness and the property tax rate. More businesses closed as workers left the area to seek jobs in other regions. The more established white workers had an easier time gaining jobs in other localities, and the city population became increasingly black. \"Brownfields\" (areas with environmental contamination by heavy industry) have made redevelopment more difficult and expensive. Street gangs appeared in city neighborhoods. Like other cities with endemic problems by the 1960s, violence added to residential mistrust and adversely affected the downtown retail base and the city's income. The construction of freeways also contributed to East St. Louis' decline. They were constructed through and broke up functioning neighborhoods and community networks, adding to the social disruption of the period. The freeways made it easier for residents to commute back and forth from suburban homes, so the wealthier people moved out to newer housing. East St. Louis adopted a number of programs to try to reverse decline: the Model Cities program, the Concentrated Employment Program, and Operation Breakthrough. The programs were not enough to offset the loss of industrial jobs due to national restructuring. In 1971, James E. Williams was elected as the city's first black mayor. Faced with the overwhelming economic problems, he was unable to make much of a difference. In 1975, William E. Mason was elected mayor; his term marked a return to patronage politics and the city sank deeper into debt and reliance on federal funding. In 1979, Carl Officer was elected as mayor (the youngest in the country at that time at age 25). Despite hopes for improvement, conditions continued to decline. Middle-class citizens continued to leave the city. People who could get jobs moved to places with work and a decent quality of life. Lacking sufficient tax revenues, the city cut back on maintenance, sewers failed, and garbage pickup ceased. Police cars and radios stopped working. The East St. Louis Fire Department went on strike in the 1970s. Structure fires destroyed such a significant number of consecutive blocks that much of the post-Armageddon film Escape from New York was filmed in East St. Louis. In 1990, the State of Illinois passed (65 ILCS 5/Art. 8 Div. 12) The Financially Distressed City Law. Under this law, Illinois Governor James R. Thompson provided $34\u00a0million in loans to East St. Louis, with the stipulation that an appointed five-member board, called the East St. Louis Financial Advisory Authority, manage the city's finances. In 1990 the state legislature approved riverboat gambling in an effort to increase state revenues. The opening of the Casino Queen riverboat casino generated the first new source of income for the city in nearly 30 years. In 1991, Gordon Bush was elected mayor. Several major industries operating in the area had gained separate incorporation as jurisdictions for the land where their plants are sited. These \"communities\" have virtually no residents, and the shell jurisdictions are outside the tax base of East St. Louis. Residents of the city, however, suffer from contaminated air and other adverse environmental effects of these sites. At the same time, the city's tax base is too poor for it to maintain its infrastructure, including the sanitary sewers, many of which have broken and overflowed in residential neighborhoods and schools."

Public-private partnerships have resulted in a variety of new retail developments, and housing initiatives. The St. Louis MetroLink light rail connects the city by transit to St. Louis, which has a stronger economy, and such efforts have sparked renewal. Because of depopulation, the city has many abandoned properties and extensive urban blight. Sections of \"urban prairie\" can be found where vacant buildings were demolished and whole blocks have become overgrown with vegetation. Much of the territory surrounding the city remains undeveloped, bypassed by developers who chose more affluent suburban areas. Many old, \"inner city\" neighborhoods abut large swaths of corn and soybean fields or otherwise vacant land. In addition to agricultural uses, a number of truck stops, strip clubs, and semi-rural businesses surround blighted areas in the city. In 2010, the East St. Louis community gardening movement began to develop plots for \"urban farming\", as has been done in North St. Louis. Inspired by Detroit's planned use of vacant land for green development, community associations, nonprofits and universities have collaborated to spark green development in East St. Louis."

        "content": "In the early 1990s, archeological surveys and excavations prior to construction of Interstate 55/70 revealed evidence of important prehistoric structures in the East St. Louis area. Both sides of the river had earlier been reported as having numerous earthwork mounds when Europeans and Americans first settled in the area. Unfortunately, most of these cultural treasures in St. Louis and on the east side were lost to development. Illinois researchers discovered the remains of several earthwork mounds. In the East St. Louis area, 50 mounds had been mapped before the Civil War, and seven remain visible today. The largest is estimated to have been originally 40 feet high and would have nearly covered a football field. Around the remains of this mound, researchers have discovered evidence of burial mounds, a large plaza, a wooden defensive palisade and several other Mississippian culture structures. These indicate that it was a ritual center. The 500-acre prehistoric site is now called the East St. Louis Mound Center. The state and University of Illinois are trying to develop coordinated projects with East St. Louis and businesses to use the mounds and artifacts as attractions for heritage tourism. It was built by the Mississippian culture, which extended throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. It reached its peak in this region about AD 1100\u20131200 at the nearby major center of Cahokia, a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site within the present-day boundaries of Collinsville. A complex urban center estimated to have had a population of perhaps 20,000, this site is about five miles from East St. Louis. In 2012, archeological work prior to construction of the Stan Musial Bridge across the Mississippi discovered artifacts and evidence of a formerly unidentified 900-year-old suburb of Cahokia in present-day East St. Louis. This site had not been mapped in the 19th century, and was unknown. The Mississippian culture site is in a present industrial wasteland. Researchers found evidence of more than 1,000 dwellings and the base of an earthen pyramidal mound. It would have been one of dozens of mounds when the community was active, based on the size of the residential population of this site. Discovery of the site led scholars to increase their estimates of the total population of the Mississippians at Cahokia and in the area, now thought to have been about 20,000. They did not have the time to excavate the entire area. It is on private land and subject to risk of destruction by development."

Money was sent to purchase forty acres of land for a town site by several benevolent Moravian sisters. It was their wish that town lots be sold and the money be used to build a Moravian Church. The families made the long journey to Iowa and acquired many acres of land. The town site of Moravia was laid out on June 27, 1850 and was recorded July 15, 1851. The surveying was done using a pocket compass and tapeline for measuring instruments. The old ridge road from Unionville, Iowa to Moravia and west to Iconium, Iowa was the Mormon Trail of 1846 from Nauvoo, Illinois to Salt Lake, Utah. Moravia observed its sesquicentennial anniversary (150th birthday) July 4, 2001. The sesquicentennial anniversary was celebrated with a giant birthday party with events scheduled all day. A Moravian Church was built and dedicated in 1851. The early Moravian Families honored the customs of the Moravian Church, which was founded in the country of Moravia in 1597. Several of these customs are remembered and celebrated today in Moravia's annual events and festivals. Since the town was founded, it has experienced a rich tradition in the customs of the town's Moravian founders. The Moravia Tour of Homes is an example of a custom founded in the country of Moravia. Christmas time was a time for Moravians to visit their neighbors and view their colorful Christmas decorations. This custom is remembered and practiced at Christmas time each year by The Moravia Tour of Homes. Another Moravian custom relived each year at Christmas time in Moravia is the Lovefest. The love fest is a traditional religious service with music provided, usually by local talent. Moravian refreshments are served in the tradition of the early Moravians."

Robert Simerwell established a Baptist Mission Station \"on the south side of Pottawatomie Creek\" following the Potawatomie Trail of Death. When the Federal Government moved the Potawatomie (and the Baptist Mission) to the Kansas River valley in the mid-1840s, brothers William, Peter, and \"Dutch\" Henry Sherman were left as the first permanent settlers. The community was known as Dutch Henry's Crossing because a wagon road forded the creek near the Sherman cabin. The area of Lane west of Kansas Avenue was originally laid out under the name Shermanville in 1855. It was renamed Lane in 1863 for James H. Lane, a leader of the Jayhawkers abolitionist movement, who served as one of the first Senators from Kansas. When the Missouri Pacific Railroad arrived in 1879, a competing community, called either Emerson or Avondale, was laid out east of Kansas Avenue. Within two years the competition between the two towns ceased, and both townsites had merged into the single community of Lane. Lane was incorporated as a city in 1908. Lane is near the site where in 1856, the abolitionist John Brown and four other of his followers hacked five pro-slavery men, one of whom was William Sherman, to death with broadswords near Mosquito Creek and Pottawatomie Creek. The event is commonly referred to as the Pottawatomie massacre."

Despite an uneven and somewhat broken surface, the town's principal occupation became agriculture. The two branches of the Nezinscot River provided water power for mills. By 1859, when the population was 1,151, Sumner had three sawmills, two gristmills, two shingle mills, a starch factory, a clover mill (to clean clover seeds, food for cattle), and a powder mill. The Rumford Falls and Buckfield Railroad opened a station near East Sumner in 1878."

It included lands in the present-day District of Columbia and in Prince George's County, and was composed of previously established land patents such as Henrietta Maria, Widows Purchase, Yarrow and Yarrow Head. Chillum Castle Manor was named after Chilham Castle, the old home of Sir Dudley Digges, an ancestor of William Dudley Digges, in Kent, England. The manor house for the Henrietta Maria parcel was named Green Hill. It was home to William Dudley Digges and was the place where Pierre L'Enfant, designer of nearby Washington, D.C., died in destitution in 1825.  He remained buried at the Green Hill property until being re-interred at Arlington National Cemetery in 1909.  The Green Hill plantation was subsequently purchased by George Washington Riggs, who built the present Green Hill historic home in 1868. Since this area was not served by public transportation, such as a streetcar, Chillum remained rural in character into the 1930s. Beginning in the mid-1930s, the area of Chillum that is close to the District of Columbia border was subdivided into lots. Developers promoted the area\u2019s convenient access into the city as well as its water, gas, and electricity supply. The first platted developments in the late 1930s included Chillum Gardens and Oakdale Terrace. The developers of these communities sold the lots but left the construction of houses to the lot owners. Consequently, the communities were slow to develop. In contrast, the developer-built Green Meadows and Brookdale Manor were platted in the early 1940s and completed by 1942. Other developer-built communities begun in the 1940s include Chillumgate (1946) and Michigan Hills Park (1940s). Several subdivisions were constructed along Riggs Road, Sargent Road, and Sligo Creek Park in the 1950s, including Sargent Knolls (1950), Bel Air Estates (1955), Parkland (1955), Carrington (1957), and Miller Estates (mid-1950s-early 1960s). The street pattern of these communities are typical of their period. They have a grid pattern of streets broken by a few curvilinear roadways and cul-de-sacs. In addition to single-family residences, two apartment communities were constructed in 1949. The Chillum Heights Apartments consist of three story brick structures containing a combined total of 1,147 units. Larger-scale apartment complexes and mid-rise structures were constructed in the 1960s."

The school administration decided to rename the school after they found a liquor store had a similar name. According to principal Adela Acosta, the community chose Chavez since he was Hispanic/Latino as was most of the school's students. The parent-teacher organization chose Chavez, the school held a public hearing on the matter on January 10, 2000, and the county board approved the name change on March 30, 2000; it was effective fall 2000. Carole Highlands Elementary School has a Takoma Park postal address but is within the 2010-defined Langley Park CDP boundaries. As of the 1990 US Census and the 2000 US Census, Carole Highlands Elementary, as well as all of the Langley Park CDP areas south of Road 193, was in the Chillum CDP.

This was the highest percentage of Jamaican Americans of any place in Maryland. In the same year, 9% of Chillum identified as being of West Indian ancestry. However, since the 1990s, the Hispanic/Latino population has significantly increased in Chillum, MD as immigrants from countries all over Central America found plenty of labor/ janitorial/ housekeeping jobs in the Washington D.C. area and an abundance of affordable housing in Chillum, MD that would allow them to commute very easily and conveniently to their jobs. The Hispanic/Latino population gradually increased in Chillum over the past two decades to the point where they have overtaken the African-American/Jamaican population living in the area. There are also quite a few Caribbean and African immigrants as well that began settling in Chillum since the 1990s as well. The most commonly spoken foreign language in Chillum is Spanish.

        "content": "In 1660, five men from Dedham were sent to explore the lakes near George Indian's wigwam and to report back to the selectmen what they found. The report of those men, Daniel Fisher, Anthony Fisher, Sgt. Fuller, Richard Ellis, and Richard Wheeler, was received with such enthusiasm that in March 1661 it was voted to start a new settlement there. The Town then voted to send Ellis and Timothy Dwight to go negotiate with King Phillip to purchase the title to the area known as Wollomonopoag. They purchased 600 acres of land for \u00a324, 6s. The money was paid out of pocket by Captain Willett, who accompanied Ellis and Dwight. The Town voted to assess a tax upon the cow commons to repay him, but some thought the money should be paid by those who would be moving to the new village. The dispute resulted in Willet not being paid back for several years. After the boundaries of the new community were set, the Town voted to give up all rights to the land in return for the proprietors paying Dedham \u00a3160 over four years, beginning in 1661. By January 1663, however, little progress had been made towards establishing a new village. A meeting was called, and the 10 men who volunteered to go raised several concerns about their ability to move forward. After much discussion, it was decided not to give the 600 acres to the group of pre-selected men, but rather to lay out lots and then award them by lottery. Those who already began to improve their lots were allowed to keep them, and land for a church, burial ground, training ground, roads, and officer lots were not included. All were free to buy and sell their lots. Not much happened at Wollomonopoag until 1668, at which time a report arrived of native peoples planting corn and cutting down trees on the land that Dedham had purchased. Eleazer Lusher was charged with sending the illiterate Indians a letter warning them to \"depart from that place and trespass no further.\" Samuel Fisher then took it to them and read it aloud, at which point they replied that they had every intention of remaining on the land. Though they had still not paid him back for the land in question, the Town then asked Willett to speak with King Phillip and ask that he intervene. There is no record of Phillip's response to that entreaty but, in August 1669, the Town Fathers received an odd letter from him offering to negotiate for more land if they would quickly send him a \"holland shirt.\" Dwight and four others were appointed to negotiate with him again, provided Phillip could prove he, and not another sachem, had the rights to the land. In November, an agreement was reached to clear the title for \u00a317 0s 8d. There is no record of whether a shirt was traded. Samuel Sheares lived alone at Wollomonopoag for some time before a new attempt at a settlement was undertaken in 1671. Five men, John Thurston, Thomas Thurston, Robert Weare, John Weare, and Joseph Cheeney moved there with him, followed the next year by Rev. Samuel Man, a one-time teacher in the Dedham Public Schools. Robert Crossman was employed at the same time to construct a corn mill. Those who moved there were drawn from the middle class of Dedham. They were primarily people from outside of Dedham who had purchased land there, and second generation Dedhamites who moved without their parents. Without the outsides, it is questionable whether the new community would have survived. Soon, however, the Wollomonopoag settlers complained that those in the village center were keeping them in a state of colonial dependency. They were upset about absentee landlords whose land values were going up thanks to the labor of the inhabitants and who refused to pay taxes to support the community. They also complained that with the seat of the town government being so far away that they were disenfranchised and best by a lack of capital. Constables refused to travel to Wollomonopoag to make collections, assessments, and social judgement. With the blessing of Dedham's Board of Selectmen, the General Court separated the new town of Wrentham on October 16, 1673. It was burned down during King Philip's War 1675\u20131676. In the nineteenth century, Wrentham was the site of Day's Academy. For a short time, Wrentham was the residence of the educational reformer Horace Mann. It is also known as one of the residences of Helen Keller."

Originally named Fort Crook, it was renamed in honor of World War I pilot and Omaha native 1st Lt. Jarvis Offutt in 1924. Offutt AFB's legacy includes the construction of the Enola Gay and Bockscar, the planes that dropped Little Boy and Fat Man over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II. Offutt served over 40 years as the headquarters for the former Strategic Air Command (SAC) and home for its associated ground and aerial command centers for the U.S. in case of nuclear war during the Cold War.

Located some 10 miles south of Omaha and two miles west of the Missouri River, the fort was constructed between 1894 and 1896. The fort's namesake was Major General George Crook, a Civil War veteran and Indian fighter. It was first used as a dispatch point for Indian conflicts on the Great Plains. Troops from Fort Crook fought during the Spanish\u2013American War when the 22nd Regiment under Charles A. Wikoff was dispatched to Cuba. The regiment suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of El Caney. Only 165 of the 513 regiment members survived with most succumbing to tropical diseases after the battle. The oldest surviving portion of Fort Crook is the parade grounds and surrounding red brick buildings that were constructed between 1894 and 1896. These structures are still in active use today as squadron headquarters, living quarters for high-ranking generals (Generals Row), and Nebraska's oldest operational jail."

In the spring of 1921, the plowing, leveling, and seeding of 260 acres of land at Fort Crook created an airfield suitable for frequent takeoffs and landings and as a refueling stop for mail and transcontinental flights. The first permanent aircraft hangars were completed in 1921. Other known organizations assigned to the field were the 74th Balloon Company in November 1918; 60th Balloon Company in December 1918. On 6 May 1924, the airfield was officially named \"Offutt Field\". The field accommodated interim reserve flying training and regular Post Office Department airmail flights during the 1920s and 1930s; a small detachment of enlisted men (detached service) from Marshall Field and Fort Riley, Kansas, constituted the only military presence on the field between 1935 and 1940."

Production switched to B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombers in 1944, and 531 Superfortresses were produced before the end of World War II. Among these were the Enola Gay and Bockscar, the B-29's that dropped the first atomic weapons to be used in a military action (against the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan). Production ended on 18 September 1945, when the last B-29 rolled out of the assembly building. With the manufacturing plant's closure, custody of the airfield and ground facilities were assumed by the 4131st Army Air Force Base Unit, Air Materiel Command."

Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington chose to locate the Air Force's crucial long-range atomic strike force at Offutt primarily because the base was centrally located on the North American continent, placing it well beyond the existing range of long-range, nuclear-armed bombers to (then) stay safely out of range of hostile missiles or bomber aircraft. Offutt's population and facilities grew dramatically to keep pace with the increased operational demands during the Cold War. Several new dormitories and more than 2,000 family housing units \u2013 built in the late 1950s and 1960s under incremental Wherry and Capehart projects \u2013 quickly replaced the old quarters of Fort Crook. Headquarters SAC moved from the Martin-Nebraska complex to Building 500 in 1957, and new base facilities in the 1960s and 1970s included a hospital, main exchange, commissary, and library. During the late 1950s, Offutt housed a Royal Air Force facility for servicing Avro Vulcans, which visited the air base frequently while on exercise with SAC. Operational use of Offutt Air Force Base included the basing of alert tankers in the late 1950s and 1960s, support for intercontinental ballistic missile sites in Nebraska and Iowa in the 1960s, and worldwide reconnaissance from the mid-1960s to the present. To provide air defense of the base, the United States Army established the Offutt AFB Defense Area, and Nike-Hercules Surface-to-air missile sites were constructed during 1959. Sites were located near Cedar Creek, Nebraska (OF-60) , and Council Bluffs, Iowa (OF-10) . They were operational between November 1960 and March 1966. The missiles were operated by the 6th Battalion, 43rd Artillery. During the Cold War, a general and various support personnel from the base were airborne 24-hours a day on an EC-135 from 3 February 1961 to 24 July 1990 in Operation Looking Glass, creating an airborne command post in case of war. Operation Looking Glass carried out its mission without any mishaps or incidents during its 29 years of existence. The 3902d Air Base Wing was inactivated on 1 March 1986, and the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing assumed host-unit responsibilities for Offutt. Increased defense spending during the 1980s brought additional operational improvements to Offutt, including the Bennie Davis Aircraft Maintenance Hangar, and a new command center for Headquarters SAC."

The Strategic Air Command (SAC) was inactivated on 1 June, succeeded by the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), a Unified Combatant Command of the Department of Defense. The 55th Strategic Wing then became the 55th Wing, under the newly created Air Combat Command. In 1998, the Strategic Air and Space Museum moved 30 miles (48\u00a0km) southwest to Ashland, just off Interstate 80, midway between Omaha and Lincoln. In 2005, Offutt began several major renovations. The on-base Wherry housing area was demolished for replacement with new housing. A new fire house, AAFES mini-mall, and U.S. Post Office were completed in 2006. Additionally, the Air Force Weather Agency broke ground on a new facility which was completed in 2008. The new headquarters for STRATCOM, the Command and Control Facility (C2F), is expected to be operational in September 2018. The base sustained significant damage in the spring of 2019 as a result of the Missouri River flooding; at one point, almost half of the base's runway was underwater. Flight operations and some support staff were temporarily relocated to nearby Lincoln Air National Guard Base while repairs (as well as some pre-planned construction projects) were undertaken."

Bush arrived at 2:50\u00a0pm (Eastern), conducted a video conference in an underground command bunker and left for Washington, DC at 4:30\u00a0pm. Air Force One left Barksdale AFB for Offutt AFB around 1:30\u00a0pm. Air Force One entourage was pared down to a few essential staffers such as Ari Fleischer, Andrew Card, Karl Rove, Dan Bartlett, Brian Montgomery, and Gordon Johndroe, plus about five reporters. During the flight, Bush remained in \"continuous contact\" with both the White House Situation Room and Vice-President Dick Cheney in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. Air Force One landed at Offutt shortly before 3:00\u00a0pm. At 3:06, Bush passed through security to the US Strategic Command Underground Command Center () and was taken into an underground bunker designed to withstand a nuclear blast. There, he held a teleconference call with Vice-President Cheney, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, CIA Director George Tenet, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, and others. The meeting lasted about an hour. Rice recalled that during the meeting, Tenet told Bush, \"Sir, I believe it's al-Qaeda. We're doing the assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al-Qaeda.\" The White House staff was preparing for Bush to address the nation from the Offutt bunker, but Bush decided instead to return to Washington. Air Force One left Offutt around 4:30\u00a0pm."

In April and May 1961, the three complexes became the last Atlas D missiles to go on alert. The missiles were manned by the 549th Strategic Missile Squadron which was activated on 1 October 1960. The squadron began to phase down with the inactivation of the Atlas-D on 1 October 1964, and was inactivated 14 December 1964. Confusingly, the squadron was originally the 566th but on 1 July 1961 SAC swapped designators with the 549th at F.E. Warren AFB. The 549th SMS was under the 385th Strategic Aerospace Wing. Site \"A\" was abandoned for many years, until the late 1970s when the Nebraska National Guard took over ownership of the site to establish a training area called the Mead Training Site.  The site is managed by the Camp Ashland Training Site Command.  The training area has been used by the National Guard, United States Air Force, local law enforcement, and other entities as a training site for many years. 3/209th RTI out of Camp Ashland began using Mead Training Site in 2008 as the primary training facility for their 88M military occupational specialty reclassification school and continues to use the site year round.  A MOUT site (Military Operations in Urban Terrain) was constructed at the site in 2009.  Two Nebraska National Guard armories were built directly alongside the training area in 2012.  Many other National Guard units use the site for drill weekends and annual trainings. Airmen out of Offutt Air Force Base practice Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) Training at the site several weekends a year. Site \"B\" is in use for agricultural storage.

Offutt appeared in the Star Trek episode \"Tomorrow Is Yesterday\" (identified as 'the Omaha installation'), when a fighter pilot stationed there detects the approaching USS Enterprise and is transported aboard. The Dale Brown novel Plan of Attack saw nuclear missiles launched by Russian bombers attacking multiple bomber bases all over the U.S, including Offutt, which is destroyed by four Kh-15 (AS-17 Kickback) missiles. Only one Boeing E-4 NEACP escapes in time, and the officials of the Eighth Air Force and STRATCOM are eliminated in the process. Pat Frank's iconic Cold War novel Alas, Babylon (1959) has Air Force Colonel Mark Bragg, the brother of the protagonist Randy Bragg, stationed at Offutt. In the 1983 post apocalyptic feature film for television, \"The Day After\", Offutt is represented as a SAC Aircraft departs the field as the cameras then change focus to the countryside as the credits roll. Offutt is also mentioned in Strike Three, a post-apocalyptic novel, by Joy V. Smith."

By 1772, present day Sand Lake was in the Rensselaerwyck District of Albany County. It was held by the English until the Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783). In 1792, when the town of Rensselaerwyck was divided into two towns, Greenbush and Stephentown. Present day Sand Lake extended into both towns. In 1805, the Union Meetinghouse was built for worship by Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians. It was the town's oldest public building and was a station on the Underground Railroad."

        "content": "The town of Sand Lake was formed from Greenbush and Berlin from an act of legislature on March 21, 1812 and it was officially made a town on March 1, 1813. Municipal positions were established to be responsible to its citizens, including town clerk, assessors, and more. Calvin Thompson became the first Supervisor. The first postmaster, in 1815, was Daniel M. Gregory. The soil, especially on the eastern lowlands, is fertile for grazing and agriculture, particularly small fruit, strawberries, and other berrys. A new church building was established for the Trinity Lutheran Church in 1816. The Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church opened in 1816 at the West Sand Lake site. There were a number of changes in the churches and its membership around the 1830s. The present town borders were established on March 2, 1848 when the town of Sand Lake was divided into towns, Sand Lake and Poestenkill. The town was governed by a supervisor, town clerk and four justices of the peace. Town business was conducted in homes and inns for decades. There were a number of public and private schools established between 1825 and the early 20th century. A one-room schoolhouse operated in Sand Lake from 1895 until 1929. In 1866, the Wynantskill Improvement Association created three Burden Lakes from Wynantskill Creek. The lake water turned the Burden water wheel that powered commercial enterprises, like mills, of the Industrial Revolution. The Troy and New England Railway provided electric trolley service into Sand Lake from 1895 to 1925. The nine-mile route ran from Albia (of Troy) east to Averill Park. The town's economy grew with tourism and people who became residents during the summer. Municipal Home Rule Law was enacted in 1964 by the State Legislature, which gave towns greater powers. In 1968, Rensselaer County revised its form of government, replacing the Board of Supervisors with a County Executive and a County Legislature. In 1972, a town hall was established in the former Presbyterian Church. The Albert R. Fox House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001."

Roseburg was the site of the 1855 Battle of Hungry Hill, part of the Rogue River Wars of 1855\u201356, fought between several southern Oregon Indian groups and the US Army. The city was named for settler Aaron Rose, who established a homestead within the current city limits on September 23, 1851. Rose was born in 1813 in Ulster County, New York. In 1851, he came to Oregon from Coldwater, Michigan, where he had lived since 1837. Rose constructed the first building in what would become Roseburg, a rough structure made of poles and clapboards with a front room about 16 or 18 feet square; it was used as a grocery store, backed by a dining room and kitchen. Originally, guests could use the floor of the front room to spread their beds or were able to sleep out of doors under nearby oak trees. His first structure served as a roadside inn and tavern for many years. Rose built a proper hotel in 1853. He died in 1899. Roseburg was first known as Deer Creek because it was at the confluence of Deer Creek and the South Umpqua River. In 1854, voters chose Roseburg as the county seat over rival town Winchester. Rose donated  of land and $1,000 for the building of the county courthouse, and the important buildings of Winchester were moved to Roseburg before 1860. Deer Creek post office was established in 1852, and the name changed to \"Roseburgh\" in 1857. The spelling was changed to \"Roseburg\" in 1894. Roseburg was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on October 3, 1872."

Firefighters soon arrived at the building, near Oak and Pine Streets, to extinguish the fire. Earlier in the evening, a truck driver for the Pacific Powder Company, George Rutherford, had parked his explosives truck in front of the building, which was not noticed. The truck exploded at around 1:14\u00a0a.m., destroying buildings in an eight-block radius and severely damaging 30 more blocks. The truck was loaded with two tons of dynamite and four-and-a-half tons of the blasting agent nitro carbo nitrate. Rutherford had parked the truck after arranging his delivery for the following morning, despite warnings given to the Pacific Powder Company two days earlier not to leave such trucks unattended or park them in \"congested areas\". A police officer named Donald De Sues and the Chief of Police were on site and managed to evacuate citizens from the area of the truck before the explosion. Donald De Sues and the town Assistant Fire Chief were recognized as heroes that day and were both killed in the blast. A total of fourteen people died in the blast and fire, and 125 were injured. Damage was estimated at 10 to 12 million dollars; the powder company was eventually made to pay $1.2\u00a0million in civil damages, but was acquitted of criminal wrongdoing. Roseburg's downtown was rebuilt, primarily by businesses using money collected from insurance claims. The city built a new bridge over the South Umpqua River on parcels affected by the disaster. Since the incident, it is commonly referred to as the Roseburg Blast or simply \"The Blast\". In 2005, SOPTV produced a documentary examining the Blast and the experiences of those who were involved or witnessed it, entitled The Roseburg Blast: A Catastrophe and Its Heroes."

        "content": "The first known inhabitants of the Tualatin Valley were the Atfalati tribe, a subset of the Kalapuya ethnic group. Contact with Europeans in the late 1700s led to the spread of smallpox and other diseases, which devastated the Atfalati population. In 1851, due to population pressures from white settlers, surviving members of the tribe negotiated a treaty with the Oregon Territory ceding their ancestral lands throughout the Tualatin Valley to guarantee a small reservation on the banks of nearby Wapato Lake. This treaty was never ratified, and in the late 1850s, the U.S. government relocated the tribe to the Grand Ronde Reservation. Large-scale American settlement of the region began in the 1850s, due to the Donation Land Claim Act, which granted land to white settlers who moved to the Oregon Territory before 1855. In the 1870s, the West Side Railroad was built from Hillsboro to Corvallis, cutting through this region. The community of Gaston developed from a railroad stop in 1872 to a commercial center, hosting a school, post office, hotel, and blacksmith shop. Due to legal disputes, Joseph Gaston left his position at the railroad and moved to the region in 1880. He spent the next sixteen years attempting to drain Wapato Lake for farmland. The nearby community of Cherry Grove was founded in 1911 as a logging hub and briefly eclipsed Gaston. Gaston was formally incorporated in 1914. By 1916, the town possessed a general store, bank, and other enterprises. In early May 1935 workers at the Stimson Mill went on strike.  On May 22, activists left the Labor Temple in Portland to support the strikers. The next morning Oregon governor Charles Martin ordered the state police and National Guard to protect the strikebreakers. Armed with gas grenades and machine guns, the military and police forces demanded the strikers leave or be shot. The strikers chose to disperse, averting a potential bloodbath."

That high school was in use through the 1986\u201387 school year, when it was condemned. The condemning of the building became a crucial local issue for the town, with residents split between merging with a nearby district (both Forest Grove or Yamhill were considered), and building a new high school. In the end, a new high school was built and Gaston retained its independent school system and with it a degree of local pride.  Currently the Gaston School District is a full K\u201312 district, with 525 students total in 2007, and a single high school."

Though too far from Portland to benefit much at first, recently Gaston has started to see new housing and an uptick in school registrations. The late 1980s brought a new fire station and the 1990s baseball/softball-oriented park. Just after 2000, a new post office was built on the edge of town. Thus far, the town has not been able to effectively capitalize on the local wine industry's growing national and international recognition. In 2006, the mayoral candidate advocated obtaining state or federal funding to revitalize the commercial strip on Main Street which, in theory, could help the city capture some of the wine tourism dollars. In 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began purchasing land in the Wapato Lake bed to reestablish the historic wetland."

Before the American Revolution, the island was claimed by both Pennsylvania and Virginia. Both states awarded a claim to the island to citizens of their states. The dispute found its way to the Supreme Court in Irvine v. Sims's Lessee (1799). Charles Simms won the case and gained possession of the island. It was eventually transferred to his partner in the lawsuit, General John Neville, for whom the island, and the township, is named. Neville lived on the island in his final years. The township was incorporated on April 8, 1854, from a part of Ohio Township. It obtained first-class status in 1901. A 1903 newspaper advertisement for real estate on the island promoted it as the next Manhattan Island."

        "content": "Sweeny's settlement, though not under this name, began before Texas was even a Republic. Imla Keep, a doctor and member of Stephen F. Austin's Old Three Hundred colonists, received title to a league and labor of land that included the site of Sweeny on July 24, 1824. Keep eventually returned to Louisiana, and Martin Varner acquired the land. The land was named for John Sweeny, a Tennessee colonist who arrived with family members and 250 slaves in the area in 1833. He came after his sons, William Burrell and Thomas Jefferson Sweeny, had purchased land grants near the townsite. They purchased the land grants for the price of a load of mules, and came to examine their new land holdings in 1831. John Sweeny settled nearby, and in 1835, purchased the original Imla Keep League from Varner and constructed a house on the site. The home, today the Sweeny Plantation, a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark, was occupied by original family members through the 1990s. The original home was built in 1837 by slaves using only bricks, nails, and cypress and ash wood from the land. There were also 30 slave cabins made of cypress wood. The plantation had its own sawmill, sugar house, cotton gin, blacksmith shop, commissary, and a kiln for brick manufacture. The town was named for John Sweeny. The original town stood in a forest of hardwoods with soil twenty feet deep. Sweeny was briefly called Adamston when the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway reached the area in 1905 and laid a side track lined with gardens to the community. A post office was established in 1895, closed in 1897, and was reestablished in 1909 as Sweeny. Sweeny's cotton gin and general store were built by 1908, a school was organized in 1911 with eleven students, and church services were held in 1912, when a Civic Club was founded to promote civic and social improvements. Around 1910 the R. D. McDonald Bernard River Land Development Company, which later gave a plot of land to each church denomination, purchased acreage in the area, cut it into lots, and sold it. Burton D. Hurd platted the townsite in 1911.  His Burton D. Hurd Industrial Land Company promoted ten-acre suburban garden farms in the area with the slogan, \"Soil Richer Than the Valley of the River Nile\" to prospective settlers. By 1914 the community had a hotel, a flour mill, three general stores, a cotton gin, a gristmill, a sawmill, and a population of 200. In the 1920s Sweeny shipped cotton, vegetables, live-oak parts for ships, and, for a time, bullfrogs raised by area farmers. In 1918 it had a brick factory and an orange orchard. Sweeny had an independent school system by 1912; school enrollment reached 236 by 1927, and by 1937 the community had three black schools and an all-grade white school with six teachers. The Ku Klux Klan operated briefly and held one cross-burning in the community. In 1934, oil was discovered in Old Ocean, creating development which made Sweeny prosper. In 1942, a government carbon black plant was built which was taken over by Phillips Petroleum, which developed the facilities into a refinery, natural gas liquids center, and petrochemicals complex with pipelines to markets in the eastern United States. In 2000, Phillips Petroleum merged with Conoco Inc. to form ConocoPhillips. Sweeny's population in the latter 20th century has fluctuated from 3,087 to 3,699."

        "content": "With the boom economy after World War II, people had time and money for recreation. People from Baytown especially began to take advantage of the drawbridge and built small summer/weekend houses or \"fishing camps\" along the shoreline of the present Beach City. By the early 1950s, they had nicknamed FM-2354 \"Tri-City Beach Road\", because the present Baytown resulted from a merger of three smaller towns in 1948. However, a number who came for recreation decided to stay. By the early 1960s the community commonly called Tri-City Beach had about 500 permanent residents. At that time, the Texas legislature began to consider annexation reform. Previously, Texas municipalities had almost unfettered power to annex adjacent lands. Cities could control vast territories by annexing ten-feet-wide strips surrounding them. During that period, Baytown controlled an area larger than the California city of Los Angeles did. Larger cities could even annex smaller cities, after they had annexed to surround them. Knowing that reform was pending, many cities began a flurry of annexations. Defensively, a number of unincorporated communities began proceedings to incorporate as municipalities. The Tri-City Beach community was one of those. On April 6, 1963, the Tri-City Beach Civic Association was formed. They met to discuss ways to better their community. The officers were Hayden Harper, a local grocer, President; Nina Harper, Secretary; Georgia Mackrell, Chairman of Publicity; and John Jennings, Chairman of the Membership Committee. The association explored a number of ideas, including the construction of a breakwater, and then began considering incorporation as a city. An Incorporation Committee was formed consisting of George Armer, Ruth Hoover, Eloice Jordan, J.D. Nicholson, and Bill White. Ms. Jordan met with County Judge Oscar F. Nelson, Jr. on March 8, 1966, and presented him with a petition for an incorporation election. On March 24, 1966, the Baytown City Council adopted Ordinance 788, consenting to the inclusion of an unspecified part of what Baytown then claimed as its extraterritorial jurisdiction within the proposed new municipality to be known as the City of Beach City. On April 5, 1966, an election was held to determine if the area would become a municipality. The results were 103 for incorporation to 4 opposed. The incorporation of Beach City was finalized by a decree issued by Judge Nelson on April 11, 1966. To prevent annexation by the nearby city of Baytown, this community voted in April 1966 to become incorporated. An election was held on May 21, 1966, to select the first municipal officers. Eloice Jordan was elected mayor.  W.D. Bush, Alvin J. Crawley, William D. Daniel, J.R. Holland, and J.D. Nicholson were chosen as aldermen for the first city council. Gus Dauzat became the first city marshal. Later Ruth Hoover was appointed by the Council as city secretary and Claude Galloway as deputy marshal. The mayors of the city have been (by date of election):"

A Tri-City Beach Emergency Medical service organization had been formed before the city's incorporation and has since been merged into a county-wide emergency medical service. With Baytown's concurrence, Beach City increased its area on August 19, 1968, by annexing approximately  near Point Barrow Road and taking in McCollum Park. The 1968 annexation moved the northern boundary of the city to Lawrence Road. This annexation brought into the city limits the historic home site of early pioneer Solomon Barrow (1801\u20131858), whose land included the area where McCollum Park is now located. The park, as a matter of record, contains the last resting place of Barrow, his wife Elizabeth Winfree, and Barton Clark, the first husband of their daughter Narcissa Ophelia Henrietta Jane Barrow. On October 27, 1970, again with Baytown's concurrence, Beach City annexed the area where the Beach City Community Building and the Beach City VFD fire station are located. That is the only part of the city limits that extends west of FM-2354. Meanwhile, there were rumors that Baytown intended to annex the community of Cove. On September 22, 1970, Beach City received a petition of 84 residents of Cove to annex the community. The mayor of Beach City at the time was Jimmy McClellan. On November 24, 1970, Beach City annexed Cove, an area bounded generally on the west by FM-2354, on the east by the Old and Lost Rivers, on the south by Lawrence Road, and on the north by a line just north of FM-565. On December 2, 1970, Beach City extended its Cove annexation to include the property where the old Cove Community Building sits. This time Baytown did not concur. In 1971, Baytown sued Beach City in an attempt to stop the annexation of Cove. In 1973, Beach City released its claim to what are now the city limits of Cove. An incorporation election was held and the City of Cove was incorporated on May 23, 1973. Leroy Stevens was Cove's first mayor. The City Council of Beach City presented to Mayor Stevens Cove's first municipal seal, which is believed to be the one still in use."

Ranching was an important part of the town's history. Historically notable families of the area are the Wolters and Welhausen families which the \"Edwin Wolters Memorial Museum\" and the \"Shiner Welhausen Park\" are named after respectively. Shiner is the home of the Spoetzl Brewery, the oldest independent brewery in Texas. The brewery is most well known for producing Shiner Bock, a dark German/Czech-style beer that is now distributed in 49 states.

One interchange, known as \"6A\" but not actually signed with a number, connects I-95 with U.S. Route 130 (US 130), which follows a southwest-northeast alignment through Florence. This interchange previously connected with Cedar Lane at an odd roadway setup (where Cedar Lane overpasses itself) the locals term the \"whirlybird\" until 1999, when the Authority constructed a double-trumpet interchange directly with US 130. The 6 toll gate is just east of Exit 6A on the Pennsylvania Extension. Interchange 6 (itself) is located in Mansfield Township. Interstate 295 also passes through Florence Township, but the nearest interchanges are in Mansfield Township and Burlington Township. County Route 543 also traverses Florence, passing over I-295 without an interchange."

        "content": "Prosser was long home to Native Americans who lived and fished along the river.  They called the area \"T\u00e1ptat\" (alternatively spelled Tap-tat, Top tut, etc.), which translates to \"long hair in front, short hair on the sides\", referring to a style of headdress. Colonel William Farrand Prosser first surveyed the area in 1879, then claimed homestead in 1882.  The Northern Pacific Railroad laid tracks through the area two years later.  A town plat was filed by Colonel Prosser in 1885, and in 1886 he was elected Yakima County Auditor.  He moved to North Yakima to attend to these duties, and never returned to the town that he founded. Lewis Hinzerling built a flour mill at Prosser falls in 1887, encouraging further settlement of the area.  The first irrigation canal was completed in 1893 by the Prosser Falls Land and Irrigation Company.  Prosser was officially incorporated in 1899 with a population of 229 people. In 1905, Benton County was carved out of the eastern portions of Yakima and Klickitat Counties. The new town of Prosser was chosen as county seat. In 1907 a power plant was added and began delivering electricity to the town.  The following year, a new high school was built, followed a year later by a telephone exchange.  In 1910 the city received a grant from the Andrew Carnegie for a public library. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s various companies drilled in this area for oil and natural gas. There were no large findings and the Great Depression put an end to exploration. On November 5, 1912, Benton County voters held a referendum to move the county seat from Prosser to either Kennewick or Benton City.  Intense rivalry and war of words between Benton City, Kennewick, and Prosser preceded the vote. Despite getting a majority of the vote, Kennewick did not receive 60 percent of the vote as required by law.  To date, Prosser remains the county seat. In 1919, Washington State College (later WSU) established the Irrigation Experiment Station at Prosser.  The program's mandate is to study the problems faced by farmers, orchardists, and ranchers in the dry central part of the state. The station originally employed scientists from the college in Pullman, who partnered with scientists from the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The station is still currently in use, and offers a number of agricultural education programs. Prosser at one point had three newspapers, which were consolidated in the 1920s into the Prosser Record-Bulletin, and a permanent courthouse was built in 1926.  The Benton County Historical Museum was dedicated in 1968. In more recent years, Prosser's location on a major river (the Yakima) and highway access has encouraged a growing wine business and associated tourist industry.  Several Prosser wineries are located within the Yakima Valley appellation."

        "title": "River Stour, Suffolk_Etymology and usage",
        "content": "The name is of ambiguous and disputed origin. On one theory, the name Stour derives from the Celtic sturr meaning \"strong\". However, the river-name Stour, common in England, does not occur at all in Wales; Crawford noted two tributaries of the Po River near Turin, spelled Stura. In Germany the Stoer is a tributary of the River Elbe. According to Brewer's Britain and Ireland the Stour is pronounced differently in different cases: the Kentish and East Anglian Stours rhyme with tour; the Oxfordshire Stour is sometimes rhymes with mower, sometimes with hour, and the Worcestershire Stour always rhymes with hour. Locally, the River Stour dividing Essex from Suffolk does not have a uniform pronunciation, varying from stowr to stoor. As against that, stour is a Middle English word with two distinct meanings and derivations, still current enough to appear in most substantial dictionaries. As an adjective, with Germanic roots, it signifies \"large, powerful\" (in present-day Scandinavian languages stor means \"big, great\"). As a noun, from medieval French roots, it signifies \"tumult, commotion; confusion\" or an \"armed battle or conflict\". Wiktionary also adds \"blowing or deposit of dust\", the primary definition in the Concise Oxford Dictionary, which adds that this is a northern English and Scottish usage of uncertain derivation. In 2006 it has been suggested that an Old European river-name was taken for an Old English adjective and that stour came to represent one pole of a structural opposition, with blyth at the opposite pole, allowing Anglo-Saxons to classify rivers on a continuum of fierceness. The Victorian etymologist Isaac Taylor, now long discredited on many counts, proposed a very simple solution: that Stour derives from d\u0175r, the Welsh word for water. It is quite possible that the various Stours do not share a common origin and that they need to be considered in their own terms rather than as a single problem. Certainly there is currently no universally-accepted explanation."

        "content": "The Stour rises in Wratting Common, Cambridgeshire, near to Weston Colville, and reaches the sea at Harwich. The eastern part of the River Stour is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty known as Dedham Vale, named after the village of Dedham in Essex. It is an area of rural beauty on both sides of the River Stour. The Dedham Vale AONB is approximately  east-west and  north-south. The earliest known settlement on the river in Suffolk was at Great Bradley, where man has had a recorded presence for over 5,000 years. The River Stour was one of the first improved rivers or canals in England. Parliament passed  'An Act for making the River Stower navigable from the town of Manningtree, in the county of Essex, to the town of Sudbury, in the county of Suffolk'  in 1705, mandating public navigation rights and providing the basis of a joint stock company of London and Suffolk investors who raised \u00a34,800 to cut and manage the river. Although partly supplanted by railways, lighters were still working on the Stour above Manningtree almost until World War II. As of 2016 they still operate as far as Mistley. The Stour valley has been portrayed as a working river by John Constable, Thomas Gainsborough, Alfred Munnings, John Nash and Cedric Morris. Constable's connection with the area was especially important, evident in such works as The Stour Valley and Dedham Church c. 1815. Today much of the Stour valley is designated an Area of Outstanding Beauty.John Nash settled in the Stour valley and is buried at St Andrew's at Wormingford , one of its typically serene small settlements. The River Stour Trust, a waterway restoration group, was set up in 1968 to protect and enhance the right of the public to navigate the River Stour. The trust seeks to restore through navigation from Sudbury to the sea, following on the successful restoration of the locks at Stratford St Mary, Dedham, Flatford and Great Cornard, by reinstating the remaining locks. Meanwhile, the trust encourages use of the River Stour by small craft and organises annual events for all age groups and abilities on different parts of the river. River Stour Trust boat trips and private charters, skippered by volunteer boat crew, are available in Flatford and Sudbury between Easter and October. The Environment Agency is the navigation authority for the river. River Stour Boating Community Interest Company (based in Bures) and Outdoor Hire Centre Network organise two-day canoeing and camping expeditions from Sudbury to the estuary at Cattawade along with other annual events such as Santa Paddle and the Coracle Regatta. RSPB Stour Estuary is a nature reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). In July 2019 sections of the river ran dry because of low rainfall and debris blocking flows at Bures Mill. The Environment Agency pumped water from boreholes into the river in an attempt to restore water levels."

Heymann said the house was built from the less sought after portion of the local \"Lueders limestone\". The middle portion of each block of stone has a cream color, while the edges are multicolored. \"We bought all this throwaway stone. It's fabulous. It's got great color and it is relatively inexpensive,\" Heymann said. In addition there is an open  limestone porch that encircles the house. The house was built by Byron Bottoms Builder from nearby Elm Mott, Texas, and wasn't completed until after Bush's inauguration because of needed accommodations for security, meeting space, etc. Laura Bush said they decided to keep a single level ranch design because \"We wanted our older parents to feel comfortable here... We also want to grow old here ourselves.\" The passive-solar house is positioned to absorb winter sunlight, warming the interior walkways and walls of the residence. Geothermal heat pumps circulate water through pipes buried ) deep in the ground. A  underground cistern collects rainwater gathered from roof urns; wastewater from sinks, toilets, and showers cascades into underground purifying tanks and is also funneled into the cistern. The water from the cistern is then used to irrigate the landscaping around the home. The one-story, eight-room, ground-level house runs east and west. There are no stairs, even at entrances. There are no thresholds. For the most part, the house is one room wide, making for easy ventilation. The porch is the usual route from one room to another. A few rooms have interior doors. \"Every room has a relationship with something in the landscape that's different from the room next door,\" Heymann says. \"Each of the rooms feels like a slightly different place.\" In the guest bathroom, for example, when you look up from the sink, you look out on an oak tree rather than into a mirror, which is on a side wall. \"There\u2019s a great grove of oak trees to the west that protects it from the late afternoon sun,\" Heymann says. \"Then there is a view out to the north looking at hills, and to the east out over a lake, and the view to the south running out to beautiful hills.\" Heymann says most of the rooms are relatively small and have high ceilings. The living-family room and the kitchen-dining room in the east end of the house are large, laid out for frequent entertaining and family gatherings. The living room has a series of glass picture doors. The tin roof of the house extends beyond the porch. When it rains, it's possible to sit on the patio and watch the water pour down without getting wet. Under a gravel border around the house, a concrete gutter channels the water into the cistern for irrigation. In hot weather, a terrace directly above the cistern is a little cooler than the surrounding area. The Bushes installed a geothermal heating and cooling system, which uses about 25% of the electricity that traditional heating and air-conditioning systems consume. Several holes were drilled  deep, where the temperature is a constant . Pipes connected to a heat pump inside the house circulate water into the ground, then back up and through the house, heating it in winter and cooling it in summer. The water for the outdoor pool is heated with the same system, which proved so efficient that initial plans to install solar energy panels were cancelled."

        "content": "At the 1900 Summer Olympics, twenty-three athletics events were contested. Altogether, 117 athletes from 15 nations competed. A total of 68 medals (23 gold, 23 silver, 22 bronze) were awarded. In many countries, due in part to the conflation of the Olympic Games and the World's Fair in Paris, the media discussed only the athletics events under the \"Olympic\" name while ignoring the incredible variety of other sports featured at the time. The 23 events listed are those currently considered to have been of Olympic stature by the International Olympic Committee and most Olympic historians.  They exclude all events that used a handicap system, as well as all events which were open to professional athletes. The IOC has never decided which events were \"Olympic\" and which were not. Competitions were held on 14 July, 15 July, 16 July, 19 July, and 22 July.  This included Bastille Day, which is a French holiday, and then Sunday, which many of the American athletes protested.  Even with many Americans not competing in finals because of confusion caused by the organizers' decision to count scores achieved on Monday, 16 July for finals held on Sunday, 15 July and subsequent rescission of that decision, the United States won more than 4 times as many medals as any other nation, including 16 of the 23 gold medals. The conditions of competition were also subpar compared even to those at the previous games in 1896.  There was no track for the Paris Games, as a grass field dotted with trees and of unequal elevation was used.  The course was 500 metres in length, an unusual distance for a track."

        "content": "Amazonas () is a state of Brazil, located in the North Region in the northwestern corner of the country. It is the largest Brazilian state by area and the 9th largest country subdivision in the world, and the largest in South America, being greater than the areas of Uruguay, Paraguay, and Chile combined. Mostly located in the Southern Hemisphere, it is the third largest country subdivision in the Southern Hemisphere after the Australian states of Western Australia and Queensland. Entirely in the Western Hemisphere it is the fourth largest in the Western Hemisphere after Greenland, Nunavut and Alaska. It would be the sixteenth largest country in land area, slightly larger than Mongolia. Neighbouring states are (from the north clockwise) Roraima, Par\u00e1, Mato Grosso, Rond\u00f4nia, and Acre. It also borders the nations of Peru, Colombia and Venezuela. This includes the Departments of Amazonas, Vaup\u00e9s and Guain\u00eda in Colombia, as well as the Amazonas state in Venezuela, and the Loreto Region in Peru. Amazonas is named after the Amazon River, and was formerly part of the Spanish Empire's Viceroyalty of Peru, a region called Spanish Guyana. It was settled by the Portuguese moving northwest from Brazil in the early 18th century and incorporated into the Portuguese empire after the Treaty of Madrid in 1750. It became a state under the First Brazilian Republic in 1889. Most of the state is tropical jungle; cities are clustered along navigable waterways and are accessible only by boat or plane. The capital and largest city is Manaus, a modern city of 2.1 million inhabitants in the middle of the jungle on the Amazon River, 1,500\u00a0km upstream from the Atlantic Ocean.  Nearly half the state's population lives in the city; the other large cities, Parintins, Manacapuru, Itacoatiara, Tef\u00e9, and Coari are also along the Amazon River in the eastern half of the state."

        "content": "At one time the Amazon River flowed westward, perhaps as part of a proto-Congo (Za\u00efre) river system from the interior of present-day Africa when the continents were joined as part of western Gondwana. Fifteen million years ago, the Andes were formed by the collision of the South American Plate with the Nazca Plate (eastern Pacific oceanic) plate. The rise of the Andes and the linkage of the Brazilian and Guyana bedrock shields, blocked the river and caused the Amazon to become a vast inland sea. Gradually this inland sea became a massive swampy, freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater. For example, over 20 species of stingray, most closely related to those found in the Pacific Ocean, can be found today in the fresh waters of the Amazon. About ten million years ago, waters worked through the sandstone to the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward. At this time the Amazon rainforest was born. During the Ice Age, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river. Three million years later, the ocean level receded enough to expose the Central American isthmus and allow mass migration of mammal species between the Americas. The Ice Ages caused tropical rainforest around the world to retreat. Although debated, it is believed that much of the Amazon reverted to savanna and montane forest. Savanna divided patches of rainforest into \"islands\" and separated existing species for periods long enough to allow genetic differentiation (a similar rainforest retreat took place in Africa. Delta core samples suggest that even the mighty Congo watershed was void of rainforest at this time). When the ice ages ended, the forest was again joined, and the species that were once one, had diverged significantly enough to be designated as separate species, adding to the tremendous diversity of the region. About 6,000 years ago, sea levels rose about 130 meters, once again causing the river to be inundated like a long, giant freshwater lake."

        "content": "In the colonial time, the territory which today belongs to the State of Amazonas, was a combination of treaties, expeditions, evangelism and military occupations. Scarce but recorded claims and indigenous uprisings in the region, were initially made by the Spanish Empire through the Treaty of Tordesillas and after the Portuguese Empire by the First Treaty of San Ildefonso. The State also includes territory from failed attempts at colonization by the European powers, such as England and the Dutch empire. The first Spanish expedition was by Francisco de Orellana in conjunction with Catholic priest Gaspar de Carvajal, who documented the expedition. He reported a conflict against indigenous women which led to the current name of the river, and then to the current name of the region and the state (Amazonas in English: Amazons). The second Spanish expedition was by Pedro de Urs\u00faa, intending to prove the previous expedition, but resulted in the Spanish Kingdom dropping the attempt to colonize the region. After the unification of the Iberian kingdoms, Portugal launched an expedition on the river [but in reverse from Francisco de Orellana, at the mouth of the river to the site of the present-day city of Quito, capital of Ecuador], with the intention of attaching Spanish lands (comprising the current territory of the Brazilian Amazon) to the Portuguese Kingdom. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union, Portuguese and Spanish possessions in the region were undefined, resulting in internal conflicts in the region between Portugal and Spain. The Portuguese Crown later asserted the principle of uti possidetis, with respect to the region. This was the first assertion of the principle from Roman law of uti possidetis, ita possideatis, (Latin, \"who has possession, has dominion\"), analogous to English common law \"Squatters rights\". Due account may have been taken of John Locke's labour theory of property. Conflicting issues arose between what was granted by law in the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), and the subsequent reality of colonial expansion: the Spanish, eastward from the Pacific coastal plains (though restrained by the Andes), and the Portuguese, westward (aided by the waterways and lowlands of the mighty Amazon). The Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750) \u2013 that determined the border between the Spanish possessions and southern Portuguese Brazil \u2013 had first enunciated the principle that new states, at the time of their creation shall have dominion over the lands that were settled as colonies. It implicitly opened the door to claims by prior possession in the vast lands of the north. After the independence of Brazil in 1822, the current borders of the Amazonas State were still undefined \u2013 at that time being with Gran Colombia. The internal conflicts within that neighbour country resulted in the emergence of Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Panama. Brazil signed the Treaty V\u00e1squez Cobo\u2013Martins (1908) (with those countries) finally entitling those possessions in the north to Brazil. One region is marked by the geodesic line Ap\u00f3poris-Tabatinga; and the other is the municipal area of S\u00e3o Gabriel da Cachoeira, on the Brazil-Colombia border."

        "content": "By the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), the whole Amazon basin was in the area of the Spanish Crown. The mouth of a great river was explored by Spanish conquistador Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n, who reached it in February 1500, with his cousin Diego de Lepe.  He called the river R\u00edo Santa Mar\u00eda de la Mar Dulce (River of Saint Mary of the Sweet Sea) on account of the large freshwater estuary extending into the sea at its mouth. In 1541, Spanish conquistadores Gonzalo Pizarro and Francisco de Orellana, from Quito, Ecuador, crossed the Andes Mountains and explored the course of the river to the Atlantic Ocean.  The indigenous people called this river the Conoris.  The myth of women warriors on the river has spread in the accounts and books, without any popular scope, still making those regions to receive names of warriors of Greek mythology, the Amazons \u2014 among them the largest river in the region that became known as the Amazon River. Early publications, as was the style of the day, called the river after its European explorer, the Orellana. Also in the 16th century, there were the expeditions of conquistadores Pedro de Urs\u00faa and Lope de Aguirre in search of the legendary El Dorado, the Lost City of Gold (1559\u20131561) Spanish Jesuit missions were the first settlements upstream on the Amazon.  As many as 30 missions were founded in Amazon territory, seven in Brazil, between 1638 and 1727. The municipality of Silves on an island of Lake Sarac\u00e1 is one of the oldest in the Amazon, originating in a Mercedarian Indian mission founded in 1663. By the early 18th century, they were destroyed by the Portuguese, depopulated by smallpox, or their indigenous residents taken away as slaves by Portuguese Bandeirantes.  A few were taken over by Portuguese Carmelites.  The destruction of the missions was the end of Spanish claims in western Amazonia. Only one is a populated place today, San Pablo, now the municipality of S\u00e3o Paulo de Oliven\u00e7a."

        "content": "From at least the time of the Tordesillas Treaty in 1494 until the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, the region of the upper Amazon was part of the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru (Viceroyalty of New Granada after 1717).  Everything north of the Amazon (Solim\u00f5es) and west of the Nhamund\u00e1 River (Yamund\u00e1, in Spanish), an affluent of the left bank of the Amazon that forms the boundary of Amazonas with Par\u00e1, was known as Spanish Guyana. Portuguese expansion westward and northward of the Torsedillas Line began from the frontier of the northernmost captaincy of Maranh\u00e3o with the expulsion of the French from S\u00e3o Luis in 1615, and the founding of Bel\u00e9m at the mouth of the Amazon in 1616.  Exploration and colonization thence followed the waterway upstream. There are accounts of Portuguese Carmelite missionaries active in the Solim\u00f5es area, upstream of the Rio Negro, as early as the 1620s, but permanent settlements weren't established for another 80 years, so the records are nebulous. The first documented Portuguese foray into upper Amazonia was the expedition of Portuguese explorer and military officer Pedro Teixeira, who followed the great river from the Atlantic Ocean to Quito, Ecuador with 70 soldiers and 1,200 Indians in forty-seven great canoes (1637\u20131639). He returned by the same route, arriving back in Belem in 1639. According to the Portuguese, Pedro Teixeira placed a possession marker at the upper Japur\u00e1 River in 1639.  Soon after that the Portuguese bandeirante Ant\u00f3nio Raposo Tavares, whose bandeira, leaving the captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente travelling overland, reached the Andes, and following the Amazon River, returned to Bel\u00e9m, visiting a total of about , between 1648 and 1651. Tropical jungle is hostile and impenetrable as well as European settlements were exclusively along the waterways. Portuguese expansion generally was east to west, and from the main channel, the Solim\u00f5es, north and south along the tributaries. The character of the settlements was of three kinds: defense and occupation (fortes), economic (feitorias), and evangelical (miss\u00f5es). The first permanent Portuguese settlements in the region were Itacoatiara 176\u00a0km east of Manaus, founded in 1655 by Portuguese Jesuit Padre Ant\u00f3nio Vieira as Mission of Aroaquis on the island of Aibi near the mouth of Lake Arauat\u00f3, followed by S\u00e3o Gabriel, founded in 1668 as by Franciscan Friar Teod\u00f3zio [or Teod\u00f3sio] da Veiga and Captain Pedro da Costa Favela on the Rio Negro, near the mouth of the Rio Aru\u00edm. In 1761, a fort was built on the location, and the settlement became the town of S\u00e3o Gabriel da Cachoeira. The first missionary aldea of the Portuguese in the Negro was that known as Santo Elias dos Tarumas (originally aldeia of Nossa Senhora da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, and later called Air\u00e3o), dating from 1692. the capital Manaus, was founded in 1669 as the Fort of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Negro (later called Lugar da Barra do Rio Negro or \"place on the shore of Rio Negro\") on the confluence of the Rio Negro and Solim\u00f5es Rivers. The Royal Charter of 1693 divided Amazonia among the Jesuits, Carmelites, Capuchines and Franciscans: the Jesuits restricted their activities to the south bank of the Amazon upstream to the mouth of the Madeira; the north shore of the Amazon as far as the Trombetas fell to the Franciscans, to the mouth of the Rio Negro to the Mercedarians, and the Negro itself and the Solimoes to the Carmelites. The Portuguese Carmelites got a later start than the Spanish Jesuits, but their impact was more durable. Between 1697 and 1757, they established eight missions on the Solim\u00f5es and nine on the Rio Negro.  In addition, there were a few Portuguese Jesuit missions in the Solim\u00f5es. In 1731, Portuguese Jesuits received orders from the Governor Luiz de Vasconcellos Lobo to establish two aldeias above the mouth of the Rio Negro, one on the right bank of the Orellana Solim\u00f5es, between the eastern mouth of the Javari and the Carmelite aldeia of S\u00e3o Pedro; the other at the western mouth of the great river Japur\u00e1.  This was the beginning of what came to be called the Jesuit\u2013Carmelite War. Antidote to settlement was disease: fierce smallpox epidemics in 1661, 1695, 1724, and 1743/49 left the region nearly depopulated.  A Carmelite Friar had notable success with the method of variolation in 1729, but the technique was not propagated. The Jenner cowpox vaccine was not introduced in Brazil until 1808. Variolation was prohibited in 1840, and vaccination was mandated in 1854.  But epidemics got worse until finally petering out around the turn of the century. Within the project of occupying the Amazon hinterland, was formed the royal captaincy of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Negro subordinate to Para, in Mar. 1755, with headquarters in the village of Mariu\u00e1, (now Barcelos)."

By the mid-18th century, the effective boundary between the two empires, the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru and Portuguese Brazil, had shifted to the area of the confluence of the Rio Negro and Amazon Rivers, in upper Amazonia. While the Treaty of Madrid in 1750 implicitly recognized the principle of uti possiditis, it did not actually specify the northern borders of the country.  At that time, the border of contention between Spanish and Portuguese domains was in the upper Solim\u00f5es, at the junction of the Rio Negro. In the upper Salomoes, Spanish missionary influence was being displaced, and the Viceroy was indifferent to colonization, but Portuguese settlements were not yet established. Part of the northern boundary between Brazil and what was then British Guyana, was set by the Spanish Boundary-line Commission of Yturriaga and Solano (1757\u20131763).  After two indecisive wars between Portuguese and Spanish colonial forces 1761\u20131763 and 1776\u20131777, the border between the Spanish and Portuguese possessions, the Viceroyalty of Peru (and successor states) and Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 region of Brazil, was set between 1781 and 1791 by negotiation."

In 1823, a ship commanded by British officer John Pascoe Grenfell arrived at the port of Bel\u00e9m, to combat rebels. Only in August 1824 did the new governor swear loyalty to the Brazilian Emperor. The Province of Par\u00e1, including the comarca of Rio Negro, the upper Amazon region, was incorporated into the Empire of Brazil in 1824. A revolt in 1832 demanded the autonomy of the Amazonas region as a separate province of Par\u00e1. The rebellion was suppressed, but the Amazons were able to send a representative to the Imperial Court, Friar Jos\u00e9 dos Santos Inocentes, who got up the creation of the District of the Upper Amazon. During Cabanagem in 1835\u201340, the Amazon remained loyal to the imperial government and not joined the revolt. As a sort of reward for loyalty, the Province of Amazonas was officially created by Emperor Pedro II in 1850."

Attracted by the rubber boom, they settled in important Amazonian cities such as Manaus, Tabatinga, Parintins, Itacoatiara and Barcelos, the first capital of Amazonas. The state had an era of splendor in the 1890s, at the peak of the rubber boom. However, the economic gains were largely the result of great human suffering: untold thousands of enslaved Amerindian seringueiros (rubber tappers) died through disease and overwork. Manaus, which already boasted as the capital administrative of the State, experienced a great population growth and the economic advancement, resulting mainly from exports of raw materials until then exclusively from Amazon Region. With the wealth generated by the production and export of natural rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), the amazonian capital received large works such as the port of Manaus, the Amazonas Opera House, Palace of Justice, Reservoir of Moc\u00f3, the first network of electric energy and public transport services as trams.

Bloomed so trade in luxury products and superfluous, with men and women from all over the world parading its streets and avenues, at purchase of the so-called \"black gold\", as was dubbed the natural rubber, to resell big profits in the main capitals of Europe and in the United States from 1910, difficult times began, due to the strong competition of natural rubber planted in rubber plantations the Asian continent, to European and American markets with superior advantages, which ultimately enact bankruptcy of Amazonian economy. By the late 19th century, the Brazilian rubber monopoly was slowly dying, as British and Dutch plantations in South-East Asia were producing cheaper, superior quality rubber, and by 1900 the Amazonas state had fallen into serious economic decline."

Despite the adoption in 1957, that project has only been in fact deployed, by Decree-Law number 288 of 28 February 1967. The project was implemented by the Brazilian military government, at first, the benefits of this project was extended to the Western Amazon, formed by the States of Amazonas, Acre, Rond\u00f4nia and Roraima. On August 20, 2008, the free trade area of Macap\u00e1, which was included in the Council of Manaus by Free Zone Superintendence (Suframa) and thus, the Amap\u00e1 received the same benefit given for other Amazonian Brazilian States. The creation of the Manaus free trade zone aimed at promoting the occupation of this region population and raise the level of security to maintain your integrity in addition, brake deforestation in the region and recoup the preservation and sustainability of biodiversity present in the state. In its years of existence, the story of the Manaus Free Trade Zone is divided into four phases: the first, from 1967 to 1975, characterized the reference in the country's industrial policy for the import substitution of final goods and formation of the internal market; the second, from 1975 to 1990, was characterized by the adoption of measures promoting the domestic industry inputs, especially in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (largest consumer at the time); the third, in 1991 and 1996, came into force on new Industrial policy and foreign trade, marked by the opening of the Brazilian economy, reducing the import tax for the rest of the country and emphasis on quality and productivity, with the implementation of the Brazilian policy quality and productivity (PBPQ in Portuguese) and Industrial competitiveness program; and the fourth and last, of the 1996\u20132002, marks its adaptation to a globalized economy scenarios and the adjustments demanded by the effects of the Real plan, as the movement of privatization and deregulation."

The state achieved a very great population growth in the early 20th century, due to the golden period of rubber, and after installation of the Industrial Pole of Manaus, in the 1960s.  The state still maintains population rates above the national average. In the 1950s the state had a population growth of 3.6% per year, while Brazil has maintained a growth of 3.2%. In the period between the years 1991 and 2000, Amazon grew by 2.7% per annum while the national average remained at 1.6%. For 2018, the estimate is 4,080,611 inhabitants. The composition of Amazonian population by gender shows that for every 100 female residents of the state there are 96 men; this small imbalance between the sexes is because women have a life expectancy of eight years higher than that of men. However, the migration to the state is mostly male. The capital, Manaus is the largest city in the northern region, with about 2,145,444 inhabitants. 52% of the state's population lives in the city. Amazonas is the second largest precinct in northern Brazil, with 2,428,098 voters, according to the Superior Electoral Court. Urbanization: 77.6% (2006); Population growth: 3.3% (1991\u20132000); Houses: 819,000 (2006). The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: Pardo (Multiracial) people (68.98%), White people (21.21%), Indigenous people (4.80%), Black people (4.09%), and Asian people (0.91%). According to a 2013 genetic study, the ancestry of the inhabitants of Manaus is 45.9% European, 37.8% Native American and 16.3% African."

Recently the Brazilian government is pursuing the development of industries whose main focus will be the exporting of consumer goods. Due to its geographical proximity to the markets in the northern hemisphere and Amazon countries, like Venezuela, they believe this move will have a great economic impact not only in the north region of Brazil but in the entire country. Over the last decades, a system of federal investments and tax incentives have turned the surrounding region into a major industrial center (the Free Economic Zone of Manaus).

Deacon Thomas Fraser first settled the area at the head of navigation on the East River of Pictou in 1784. The settlement was officially named \"New Glasgow\", after Glasgow in Scotland, in 1809, the same year its first trading post was developed. The discovery of large coal deposits in the East River valley during the early 19th century saw New Glasgow, at the head of navigation, quickly develop into a manufacturing and port community. In 1829, a horse-drawn tramway was built using standard gauge rails from the settlement of Albion Mines (now Stellarton) to a wharf near New Glasgow. This was the first use of standard gauge rails in what would become Canada. On September 19, 1839, the Albion Railway was opened from Albion Mines to New Glasgow, hauling coal wagons behind steam locomotives such as the Samson along the west bank of the East River of Pictou. This was the second steam-powered railway in what would become Canada and the first to use iron rails. The railway was extended north to a coal loading pier at Dunbar's Point on May 14, 1840. In 1840, George MacKenzie started the town's first shipbuilding company, which eventually built or owned 34 vessels; hundreds of ships would later be built along the East River in New Glasgow. In June 1867, the Nova Scotia Railway opened its \"Eastern Line\" from Truro through New Glasgow to its terminus at the passenger and cargo wharf in Pictou Landing. In 1882 the \"Eastern Extension\" of the Intercolonial Railway was opened from New Glasgow to Mulgrave on the Strait of Canso, placing New Glasgow on the mainline between Cape Breton Island and the North American rail network. Economic development in New Glasgow was driven by the steel industry in neighbouring Trenton (site of the first steel manufacturing in Canada), shipbuilding and shipping in Pictou and Pictou Landing, and coal mining in Stellarton and Westville. After World War I, the famous New York sculptor J. Massey Rhind was commissioned to make the Nova Scotia Highlander soldier cenotaph. In 1946, New Glasgow was the setting for an important civil rights case when Viola Desmond challenged racial segregation of New Glasgow's Roseland Theatre. New Glasgow became a service centre for the county during the late 20th century as shopping centres, retail and residential development was spurred by the construction of Highway 104."

Among the reasons for this, small towns adjacent to New Glasgow are having a hard time coping financially on their own due to the declining economy. Also, Pictou County has the most politicians per capita in Canada. With the Government of Nova Scotia having already amalgamated Halifax County, Cape Breton County, and Queens County into regional municipalities, Pictou County residents feel it is only a matter of time before that concept is introduced in Pictou County. The two most often suggested scenarios involve amalgamating the entire county (six municipalities) into a single regional municipality, or amalgamating the upper East River towns (New Glasgow, Stellarton, Trenton, Westville) into a single larger town.  After several months of public backlash a vote was held and the public spoke against amalgamation, effectively killing any possibility of a future merger."

New Glasgow is the commercial hub of northeastern Nova Scotia. Well known chain stores include Sobeys (three locations), Atlantic Superstore, Shoppers Drug Mart, Sears, Staples, The Brick and Canadian Tire. The Westville Road/Highland Square Mall area has seen significant commercial growth in recent years. A new Walmart opened next to Highland Square in early 2007, replacing the smaller location in the mall. Canadian Tire relocated to Walmart's old location in the spring of 2008, making it the second largest Canadian Tire store in Nova Scotia. Winners opened in Spring 2009, in Canadian Tire's former location. Future Shop has built a new store next to the new Canadian Tire, which opened in Spring 2009 but has since closed. SportChek opened a new store inside the mall in Fall 2009. The Highland Square Mall is unfortunately well known for its high turnover rate of stores and the closure of many long-time shops including Carlton Cards, Sears, Sparkles Arcade, Ranchers Steakhouse, Captain Sub, etc. About a minute away from the Westville Road commercial district, on the opposite side of the Trans Canada Highway in Stellarton, a new business park is currently being developed. The Holiday Inn Express Hotel Stellarton \u2013 New Glasgow was the first confirmed business for the park. It officially opened on July 25, 2008. Proudfoot's Home Hardware Building Centre opened in the park in 2012. The New Glasgow Farmers Market expanded into an additional, heated facility in November 2015 with the financial assistance of ACOA,  The Market is now open every Saturday from 9am until 1pm and boasts more than 70 vendors and more than 1,800 weekly visitors during the peak season from May until October. On July 1, 2017, the New Glasgow Farmers Market will unveil a new community garden project titled The Giving Garden. The project was completed by Market volunteers with the financial grants from the province's Department of Communities, Culture and Heritage through the 150 Forward Fund and a Wellness grant from the Pictou County Health Authority."

        "content": "John Wayne Airport  is a commercial and general aviation airport that serves Orange County, California, and the Greater Los Angeles area. The airport is located in an unincorporated area of Orange County, and it is owned and operated by the county. John Wayne Airport is surrounded by the cities of Irvine, Newport Beach, and Costa Mesa, although its IATA airport code and mailing address are both registered to Santa Ana, the county seat. Originally named Orange County Airport, the Orange County Board of Supervisors renamed the airport in 1979 in honor of actor John Wayne, who lived in neighboring Newport Beach and died that year. A statue of John Wayne was installed at the airline terminal in 1982. John Wayne Airport is the sole commercial airport in Orange County. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011\u20132015 categorized it as a primary commercial service airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings per year. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 4,584,147 enplanements in calendar year 2014, an increase from 4,450,628 in 2013. In 2014, John Wayne Airport was the second busiest airport in the Greater Los Angeles area (by passenger count) with over 9 million total passengers. , the largest airlines at John Wayne Airport were Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, Alaska Airlines, and Delta Air Lines. In addition to the airline terminal, several facilities at the airport serve the general aviation and corporate aviation community. General aviation operations outnumber commercial operations. The only other general aviation airport in Orange County is Fullerton Municipal Airport. John Wayne Airport has two runways. The main runway, 2L/20R, at  in length, is one of the shortest of any major airport in the United States, and passenger jetliners operating from the airport have never been larger than the Boeing 757 (although some larger cargo aircraft fly from SNA, such as the widebody Airbus A300 operated by FedEx). Runway 2R/20L is  long and serves general aviation aircraft. No widebody passenger jetliners have ever been operated into SNA in scheduled airline service."

        "content": "The first airstrip on the grounds was constructed in 1923, when Eddie Martin signed a five-year lease with James Irvine to operate a flying school on land owned by the Irvine Company. It was purchased through a land swap by the County of Orange in 1939 and remains under the county's ownership and management. Martin added the first hangar in 1926. In 1935 Howard Hughes staged his world speed record-setting flight from the Eddie Martin Airport. With the opening of the Santa Ana Army Air Base in 1942, the adjacent Martin Field was temporarily closed. After serving as a military base during World War II, the Santa Ana Army Airfield was returned by the federal government to the county with the stipulation that it remain open to all kinds of aviation uses. In addition to continuing to serve aviation, the field became an important drag racing center. From 1950 to 1959, C.J. \"Pappy\" Hart and Creighton Hunter operated the Santa Ana Drag Strip, credited for being the world's first commercial drag strip, on the airport runway every Sunday, when it was closed to air traffic. The original single runway was  long, on a magnetic heading of 210 degrees (Runway 21) and 30 degrees (Runway 3). In 1964 the airport was rebuilt, with its present two parallel runway configuration, oriented 190/10 degrees magnetic. The longer runway, 19R (now 20R), at , is only  longer than the old Runway 21 but long enough to accommodate jet airliners. A full instrument landing system (ILS) was also installed. In the 1950s, the only airline flights were Bonanza's few flights between Los Angeles and Phoenix, via San Diego. In 1963 Bonanza started nonstop F27s to Phoenix, and to Las Vegas in 1965; in 1967 Air California started Electra nonstops to San Francisco, 48 flights a week each way. The first scheduled jet flights were Bonanza DC-9s later in 1967. In 1967, the  Eddie Martin Terminal was built to accommodate 400,000 annual passengers. Remodeling added two passenger holding areas in 1974, a new baggage claim area in 1980 and a terminal annex building in 1982, bringing the facility to . Nonstop flights reached Salt Lake City in 1976\u201377 (Hughes DC9s), Denver in 1982 (Frontier MD80s), Dallas/Fort Worth in 1983 (American MD80s), Chicago in 1986 (AirCal 737-300s), and New York\u2013Kennedy in 1991 (America West 757s). After the Orange County Airport was renamed John Wayne Airport on June 20, 1979, the John Wayne Associates commissioned sculptor Robert Summers to create a bronze statue of \"the Duke\". The  statue, created at Hoka Hey Foundry in Dublin, Texas, was dedicated to the County on November 4, 1982. Today, the bronze statue is in the Thomas F. Riley Terminal on the Arrival Level. In 1990, the Thomas F. Riley Terminal opened. The aging  Eddie Martin Terminal was replaced with a modern  facility. The new facility included 14 loading bridges, four baggage carousels, wide-open spaces and distinct roadside arrival and departure levels. In 1994, the then-unused Eddie Martin Terminal was demolished. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a new, larger airport was proposed for the nearby site of the then recently closed El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. However, after a series of political battles, combined with significant opposition from residents in the vicinity of El Toro, the proposal was defeated, and no new airport was built. In 2011, additional terminal space was added and existing terminals were refreshed as part of a $543 million expansion project. A new Terminal C with six additional gates was built along with dedicated commuter gate areas in the new Terminal C and new commuter facilities in Terminal A. A new parking lot C was added along with additional support facilities such as a Central Utility plant. In June 2020, a name change was requested, due to comments the actor made believed to be in support of white supremacy to Playboy in a 1971 interview. In September 2020, Orange County officials have planned to end all of JSX operations at SNA on January 1, 2021, stating it is \"no longer welcomed\". This announcement prompted the airline to seek support from customers, encouraging them to contact the Orange County officials for reconsideration in order for the airline to continue operations at Orange County. Since December 2020, the airline has filed a lawsuit against the airport, stating that it has \"refused to offer any accommodations\" to the airline. It stated that the airport \"discriminatorily chose\" to terminate the airline's operations at SNA \"in favor of two large airlines [Spirit and Allegiant Airlines]...\" which the former already operates the same flights to Las Vegas, Reno, and Oakland. Shortly afterwards, the airline won a temporary restraining order, preventing the airport officials from terminating the airline's operations in which a spokeswoman said the airport will comply."

The airport did not have any regularly scheduled international service up until 2010 when Air Canada began operations to Toronto, Canada. Flights from Canada complete immigration and customs formalities in Canada via United States border preclearance. Southwest Airlines is operating international flights to Puerto Vallarta and San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo in Mexico as of March 11, 2021. Prior to resumption, it previously served flights to Puerto Vallarta from June 18, 2015, until March 2017. Southwest has also served flights to Cabo San Lucas until March 2020, alongside terminating other destinations at the time due to passenger limitations following a 1985 settlement agreement. Canadian airline WestJet provides non-stop year round service to Vancouver since May 2011. It is also serving direct flights to Calgary; it previously served that route from June 2011 to 2013 before ending operations up until its resumption on November 4, 2021. Air Canada also provides daily non-stop flights to Vancouver, Canada since October 2, 2021. It was set to start flights in June 2020, and then delayed to September 8, 2020, and then to May 2021, which would have marked its return to service to Orange County after 10 years. It previously operated flights to Toronto, Ontario, Canada from April 8, 2010, becoming the first-ever international airline to serve Orange County, until it ceased flights later that year. Alaska Airlines was scheduled for international service to Vancouver in 2002. However, a stop in Seattle (or change of planes) was required shortly after launch as John Wayne Airport was not authorized for pre-clearance or international flights by U.S. agencies at the time. Southwest Airlines' then-subsidiary AirTran Airways began a new service in June 2012 from John Wayne Airport to Cabo San Lucas and Mexico City. This was the first international service to use the new FIS in Terminal C. After its merger with AirTran was completed in 2014, Southwest continued to operate the Mexico flights under its original brand. However, Southwest then ended its service to Mexico City (MEX) from SNA in January 2017 before completely discontinuing all flights to MEX in March 2019. Mexico's low-cost carrier Interjet began a new service in October 2012 from Orange County to Guadalajara and Mexico City. It ended both flights in July 2014; the airport officials are seeking a replacement. Alaska Airlines began a Mexico service in October 2015. The airline began offering non-stop flights from John Wayne Airport to Los Cabos on October 8 and Puerto Vallarta on the following day, October 9. Alaska Airlines has continued this service to each airport on an every-other-day rotation. Since August 2019, the airline has discontinued flights to Mexico.

        "title": "John Wayne Airport_Aircraft noise abatement and curfew",
        "content": "A 1985 settlement agreement defined the scope of operation for John Wayne Airport in how it affects the local community. The area that lies directly south of John Wayne Airport is considered a noise-sensitive area. The agreement in conjunction with a Phase 2 Commercial Airline Access Plan and Regulation controls the number of noisier operations (mainly commercial aircraft) allowed from the airport. Noise abatement enforcement is carried out with the aid of 10 permanent noise monitoring stations. These stations are placed in areas that exceed a community noise equivalent level (CNEL) of 65\u00a0dB. The short primary runway (20R/2L), coupled with the local noise restrictions, can require a takeoff at or near full power (95\u201397% power). Some aircraft departing from the airport may cycle to full power while holding at the runway then release the brakes when engines are fully spooled up (short-field procedure). On operations from runway 20R a steep climb may also be required to allow for a power reduction at about  for a quieter overflight over the city of Newport Beach. For 20R departures, a left turn after departure to 175 degrees allows for a passage over Newport Beach within the confines of the noise abatement profile. Departures from 2L (normally during Santa Ana wind conditions) are not affected by these noise abatement procedures. Landings almost always include full flap extensions and the use of full reverse thrust. Extension of the runway is almost impossible, as it on both ends is enclosed by freeways and, past the freeways, numerous residences and businesses which would require relocation in case of such a proposition, which is a costly endeavour. The county prohibits commercial departures between 10:00 PM and 7:00 AM (8:00 AM on Sundays) and commercial arrivals between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM (8:00 AM on Sundays). Exceptions can be made for an emergency, mechanical, air traffic control or weather delay, which is beyond the control of the airline. In 2003, the settlement agreement was amended to increase operations but focused on increases only for aircraft meeting the lowest noise signatures. Access and noise reports are published by the airport and are available to the public. These reports are generated on a regular basis and outline curfew exceptions per carrier and overall noise impact. John Wayne Airport has been rated as one of the nation's scariest airports. To compensate for a short runway, and to comply with local noise restrictions, small private planes are required to take off at angles of up to 20 degrees, while commercial planes often reach 25 degrees which is steeper than other airports. Maximum takeoff weight restrictions apply to some aircraft at such steep pitches; and airlines have had to halt boarding before all ticked passengers had boarded."

        "content": "On February 17, 1981, Air California (AirCal) Flight 336 (a Boeing 737-200), with 105 passengers and five crew members, was flying from San Jose, to John Wayne Airport and crashed upon initiating a go-around. The crew was cleared for a visual approach to Runway 19R while the controller had cleared a smaller plane to take off from 19R. Upon realizing that the landing aircraft might overtake the departing one, the controller ordered the flight to go around and the other aircraft to abort its takeoff, which it did. The captain of the landing Air California aircraft delayed the go-around then initiated a gear up procedure before a positive rate of climb was achieved, causing the plane to stall. The 737 then banked left at low altitude causing the left wingtip to make contact with the runway. Then the nose came down, striking the ground, and the airplane spun around and skidded down the runway before coming to rest in the margin. A fire started, but the passengers and crew exited the plane. Of the passengers, four sustained serious injuries, and 29 suffered minor injuries. The aircraft, registered N468AC, was damaged beyond repair and was written off. On December 15, 1993, a chartered IAI Westwind business jet carrying two flight crew members and three passengers (including Rich Snyder, president of In-N-Out Burger), crashed while on approach to John Wayne Airport. All five occupants were killed in the crash. The aircraft, which departed Brackett Field, 30 miles to the north in La Verne, followed a Boeing 757 for landing, became caught in the 757's wake turbulence, rolled into a deep descent, and crashed near the intersection of State Route 55 and Edinger Avenue. The crash investigation led to the FAA requirement for an adequate period between heavy aircraft and following light aircraft to allow wake turbulence to diminish. On February 13, 2017, Harrison Ford accidentally landed his Aviat Husky on taxiway C, to the left of runway 20L.  A Boeing 737 was holding short of 20L on the taxiway when Ford overflew them. On June 30, 2017, a Cessna 310 twin-engine aircraft crashed short of a runway into a highway median on Interstate 405. The pilot made a mayday call shortly after taking off from John Wayne Airport and attempted to land after being cleared for emergency landing on runway 20R. Two people on board were injured in the crash. On August 5, 2018, a Cessna 414 scheduled to land at John Wayne Airport crashed into a Staples parking lot a few blocks north of the airport in nearby Santa Ana, killing at least five people. On January 26, 2020, a Sikorsky S-76B helicopter took off from John Wayne Airport at approximately 9:06 am PST carrying retired NBA basketball player Kobe Bryant along with his 13-year-old daughter, and 7 others bound for Camarillo Airport for a basketball event in Thousand Oaks. En route, the helicopter crashed into a hillside in Calabasas south of U.S. Route 101, killing everyone on board. The helicopter had been seen in distress under heavy fog, according to witnesses. The cause of the crash was pilot error and spatial disorientation. On the evening of August 20, 2021, an unauthorized person bypassed security and gained access to the tarmac near Terminal C, prompting a lockdown of the airport. The suspect took control of a ground crew vehicle and drove it around before abandoning it and re-entering the terminal. Police later discovered the suspect hiding in an attic space inside the terminal and took him into custody."

        "content": "There was fighting here under the Ottoman Empire: in 1606 the army of General Kuyucu Murat Pasha suppressed the Jelali revolts. The Ottomans continued to fortify the city, and the remains of the early 17th-century Ottoman castle walls can still be seen where the G\u00fcz\u00fcn stream crosses the Varyant road. The city was well described in 1675 by the English naval chaplain Henry Teonge in his diary. The next army to cross the Belen Pass and attack Anatolia through here were the Egyptians of Muhammad Ali in 1832. However, in the later Ottoman period the city developed as the main port on the Mediterranean for the overland trade from Baghdad and India, which had great importance until the establishment of the Egyptian overland route. Iskenderun served as a base, first for Genoese and Venetian merchants, then Western and Northern European merchants. The British Levant Company maintained an agency and factory here for 200 years, until 1825, in spite of high mortality among its employees because of regional disease, some due to lack of sanitation systems. During the 19th century the port grew, and the road to Aleppo was improved. The railway was built in 1912. At the outset of World War I, when Britain was contemplating the partition of the Ottoman Empire, Lord Kitchener considered the conquest of Alexandretta to be essential in providing Britain with a port and railhead from which to access Iraq. He proposed a new railway be built to the east from Alexandretta, which would greatly reduce the time for reaching India from the UK. The De Bunsen Committee (8 April - 30 June 1915), a British inter-departmental group which was set up to discuss the issue in greater detail, preferred Haifa for this purpose. Ultimately the British decided not to attack the Ottoman Empire via Alexandretta. On 8 February 1915 the French foreign minister, Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9, protested to Britain's Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey about such an attack, citing a commitment that Britain made in 1912 that it had no designs on Syria. The German field marshal, Hindenburg, subsequently said that Perhaps not the whole course of the war, but certainly the fate of our Ottoman Ally, could have been settled out of hand, if England had secured a decision in that region, or even seriously attempted it. Possession of the country south of the Tauras [mountains] would have been lost to Turkey at a blow if the English had succeeded in landing at Alexandretta.Armenians, who have maintained a cultural and economic presence in Iskenderun for centuries, most notably due to trade, were wiped out in the Hamidian Massacres, Adana Massacres, and the Armenian genocide, after centuries of discrimination."

Between 1921 and 1937, the city was part of the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta within French-controlled Syria, under the League of Nations French Mandate of Syria and the Lebanon. The Republic of Hatay was founded in 1938 and, in 1939, it joined the Republic of Turkey after a referendum. The referendum was, and still is, regarded as illegitimate by Syria, as the Turkish government moved supporters into the city and the Turkish Army \"expelled most of the province's Alawite Arabs and Armenian majority\" to decide the referendum result. In the 2010s Syria still claimed against Turkey its sovereignty on the Alexandretta region."

In that same year, he founded two other universities for the southern provinces as well, alongside the University of Ghent: University of Li\u00e8ge and State University of Leuven. After the Belgian revolution of 1830, the newly formed Belgian state began to administer Ghent University. In 1930, UGent became the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium. Previously, French (and, even earlier, Latin) had been the standard academic language in what was Universit\u00e9 de Gand. In 1991, it was granted major autonomy and changed its name accordingly from State University of Ghent (, abbreviated as RUG) to its current designation. Located in Flanders, Ghent is one of the largest Belgian universities, consisting of 44,000 students and 9,000 staff members. The University also supports the University Library (including the famous Boekentoren) and the University Hospital, which is one of the biggest hospitals in Belgium.

The university was founded by King William I as part of a policy to stem the intellectual and academic lag in the southern part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, later to become Belgium. The original four faculties consisted of Humanities (Letters), Law, Medicine, and Science, with the language of instruction being Latin. In the first year, it had 190 students and 16 professors. In 1882, Sidonie Verhelst became the first female student at the university. After peaking at a student population of 414, the number of students declined quickly following the Belgian Revolution. At this time, the Faculties of Humanities and Science were broken from the university, but they were restored five years later, in 1835. At this time, French also became the language of instruction, taking the place of Latin. However, in 1903 the Flemish politician Lodewijk De Raet would lead a successful campaign to begin instruction in Dutch, and the first courses were begun in 1906. Ghent University played a role in the foundation of modern organic chemistry. Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9 (7 September 1829 \u2013 13 July 1896) unraveled the structure of benzene at Ghent and Adolf von Baeyer (Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer), a student of August Kekul\u00e9, made contributions to organic chemistry."

A Flemish Institute (Vlaemsche Hoogeschool), commonly known as Von Bissing University, was founded in 1916 but was disestablished after the war and French language was fully reinstated. In 1923, Cabinet Minister Pierre Nolf put forward a motion to definitively establish the university as a Dutch-speaking university, and this was realized in 1930. August Vermeylen served as the first rector of a Dutch-language university in Belgium.In the Second World War, the German administration of the university attempted to create a German orientation, removing faculty members and installing loyal activists. After the war, the university became a much larger institution, following government policy of democratizing higher education in Flanders during the 1950s and 1960s. By 1953, there were more than 3,000 students, and by 1969 more than 11,500. The number of faculties increased to eleven, starting with Applied Sciences in 1957. It was followed by Economics and Veterinary Medicine in 1968, Psychology and Pedagogy, as well as Bioengineering, in 1969, and Pharmaceutical Sciences. The faculty of Politics and Social Sciences is the most recent addition, in 1992. In the 1960s to 1980s, there were several student demonstrations at Ghent University, notably around the Blandijn site, which houses the Faculty of Arts & Philosophy. The severest demonstrations took place in 1969 in the wake of May 1968. In 1991, the university officially changed its name from Rijksuniversiteit Gent (RUG) to Universiteit Gent (UGent), following an increased grant of autonomy by the government of the Flemish Community."

        "content": "Whitton may have originated at the time the Romans crossed the Humber northward in 71\u00a0AD; first as a military camp and then later as a Roman villa, overlooking the river, with its temple a few yards to the east, where the Church now stands.  It is possible that Whitton was a landing stage on the south bank for the Roman fort and civitas of Petuaria Parisorum at Brough across the river. Roman Coins of Claudius Gothicus (268\u2013270\u00a0AD) and Constantine I (the Great) (309\u2013337\u00a0AD) have been found in the fields. Pevsner states that the Church tower \"re-uses massive blocks of Roman stone\", but these  blocks of millstone grit which are to be found in several local churches (such as neighbouring Winteringham) may have been transported down the Ouse and the Humber from York where Roman buildings were being dismantled, or may even have come from some sort of triumphal arch or structure (perhaps like the Arch of Constantine), which might have stood at the end of Ermine Street. Whitton is mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book as \"Witenai\". Before the Conquest lordship was held by Siward Barn, and after by Saswalo of Ettington, with Henry de Ferrers becoming Tenant-in-chief. Listed are  of meadow, land for eight ploughs, two plough teams belonging to the lord, five men's plough teams, ten villans (villagers) four bordars (smallholders) and ten freemen. The land was valued at seven pounds. The church is not mentioned in the Domesday survey.  St. John the Baptist is a building of stone overlooking the Humber, consisting of a west tower, a small nave ( wide and  long) with a chancel and a south vestry attached.  The partly Romanesque (or Norman) tower contains three, now untolled, bells; the third bell is said to have been brought from the village of Welton, across the river in Yorkshire. The base of the tower forms a porch and the large tower arch, leading into the nave, is thought to be Romanesque.  The font is also ancient and may be from the same period. The church seems to have been almost completely rebuilt in about 1797-8 when the elaborate crocketted pinnacles were removed from the top of the tower. A drawing, by Nattes, of 1794 shows a dilapidated structure with a south aisle and a south porch. The church was reseated in 1865 at the expense of Lady Strickland, and between about 1892 and 1897 the nave, chancel and roof were entirely rebuilt from the designs of W. & C. A. Bassett-Smith, architects, of London. On the north side of the chancel are two stained-glass windows, erected in 1918 to the memory of Henry Spilman who was killed in the First World War.  In 1952\u201353 cracks in the tower were repaired under the direction of A.R Haynes, architect of Brigg. A small part of the relatively new island of Whitton Island in the Humber Estuary falls within the parish."

        "content": "Before European settlement, the area consisted of several diverse ecosystems based on freshwater, brackish water, and saltwater environments. Large areas were covered by forests. Considered by residents of the area through the centuries as wastelands, the Meadowlands were systematically subject to various kinds of human intervention. The four major categories are: Extraction of natural resources (including fish and game, as well as cedar logs). Farmers also harvested salt hay for feed. Over time, the forest resources were totally depleted, dike systems broke down, farming ceased, and contamination by pollution increased. Alteration of water flow. Drainage canals and especially the deepening of the Hackensack River for navigation have allowed salt water to enter the original fresh water and brackish water areas, altering the ecology and destroying the estuarine environment. Reclamation, land making, and development. In addition to landfill from garbage, landmass generated from dredging was also used to create new land. Some material came from building the World Trade Center in nearby New York City, in the late 1960s. Pollution by sewage, refuse, and hazardous waste. Various types of waste have been dumped legally and illegally in the Meadowlands. During World War II, military refuse was dumped in the Meadowlands, including rubble from London created by the Blitz and used as ballast in returning ships. After the war, the Meadowlands continued to be used for civilian waste disposal, as the marshes were seen simply as wastelands that were not good for anything else. Berrys Creek was extensively polluted with mercury, PCBs and other chemical wastes, and three adjacent industrial properties have been designated as Superfund sites. The opening of the New Jersey Turnpike in January 1952 only amplified the continuing environmental decline of the Meadowlands, as both spurs of the Turnpike travel through the region from the Passaic River to just past North Bergen. The Meadowlands Sports Complex, the site of multiple stadia and a racetrack, was built in the Meadowlands beginning in the 1960s."

Small firms lack the budgets to install the environmental gear that would help protect the environment. As a result, Samut Sakhon is one of the most polluted provinces in the nation. Soil and water samples from the industrial area of Mueang District were found to be contaminated with high levels of arsenic, lead, cadmium, chromium, zinc, copper, and nickel. High levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPS), byproducts of industrial processes, were present in eggs from free-range chickens. An egg tested by researchers was found to have 84 nanograms per kilogram of dioxins and furans, a level 33 times higher than the safety limit observed by the European Union. The most polluted air in Thailand in 2018 was found to be in Samut Sakhon province. According to the PCD, the level of PM2.5 in the provincial atmosphere in 2019 was unusually high, measuring as high as 195 micrograms per cubic metre (\u03bcg/m3). During the air pollution \"season\" of 2018\u20132019, PM2.5 levels exceeded the PCD's safe threshold of 50 \u03bcg/m3 for 41 days. Samut Sakhon is a leading sea salt producer. According to a survey in 2011, 12,572 rai of salt pans were managed by 242 families in Samut Sakhon."

The farm name seems to date back to the late Middle Ages. Its known history begins in 1618 when Thomas Russell bought it. Part of the present farmhouse was already there and Thomas Russell added to it in 1624, also building a substantial new barn with timbers from a ship. Despite suppositions, it cannot be shown that they came from the Mayflower, the ship that carried the Pilgrim Fathers from Plymouth to New England. A piece of the timber was taken from the Mayflower Barn, placed in the Peace Arch built by Sam Hill and opened in September 1921. Besides the completion of the Pacific highway from the Canadian boundary to Mexico, the arch also marked a century of peace between the United States and the UK. A plaque shows where the timber was taken from the Mayflower Barn. The Barn was a tourist attraction to visitors from all over the world, particularly the Americas, but is now privately owned and closed to the public."

        "content": "Pasadena City College was founded in 1924 as Pasadena Junior College. From 1928 to 1953, it operated as a four-year junior college, combining the last two years of high school with the first two years of college. In 1954, Pasadena Junior College merged with another junior college, John Muir College, to become Pasadena City College. In 1966, voters approved the creation of the Pasadena Area Junior College District. The name was subsequently changed to the Pasadena Area Community College District. Pasadena City College is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, an institutional accrediting body recognized by the Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation and the U.S. Department of Education. The Shatford Library is a direct descendant of the original Pasadena High School library that originally occupied the campus. The $16.5-million Shatford Library opened September 7, 1993, and holds 133,024 volumes in the general book collection, over 300 periodical subscriptions (plus over 2,000 titles in electronic databases) 7,338 audio cassettes, 1,019 paperbacks, 661 CDs and software, 404 volumes in the Special Services collection, and 1,186 videocassettes. Walter T. Shatford II, is the attorney for whom the library was named in recognition of his four decades of service on the school's board and his donations. He was also active in the Civil Rights Movement. In 2003, voters approved a bond measure for about $150 million that improved campus facilities. A significant portion of these funds were earmarked for the construction of a new building to house the college's art and music departments. The Alumni Commons, the Aquatic Center, the Boone Sculpture Garden, and the Galloway Plaza have all replaced what were once campus parking lots. A new fourth floor parking structure (Lot 5) and a new bus parking area were completed in 2005. In 2007, many services at the school had to relocate pending demolition of their previous facilities. These included the college bookstore, Student Affairs, Associated Students, the student business services, the campus police and the offices of the school newspaper The Courier. A groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the new Industrial and Technology building, Campus Center and Bookstore took place in October 2007. The Campus Center and Bookstore opened in August 2009. The school is one of the few community colleges with its own observatory, planetarium, and seismograph."

Mark W. Rocha, former West Los Angeles College president, assumed the role of president/superintendent on July 1, 2010, when he was chosen to replace Lisa Sugimoto.  His presidency was controversial with some constituents, including the faculty who twice voted \"no confidence\" in him, and he resigned in the summer of 2014. Previous presidents/superintendents include Jack Scott (1987\u20131995), who served as California State Assemblymember from 1996 to 2000 and California State Senator from 2000 to 2008. , Scott is Chancellor of the California Community College system; James Kossler, 1995\u20132007; Paulette Perfumo, who held the position from August 2007 until her abrupt resignation in 2009; and Lisa Sugimoto, who served as acting president through the end of the 2009\u20132010 academic year."

The stadium's surface is SprinTurf, while the track has been converted to an all-weather surface. In addition to the school students, the stadium is used by local students from Marshall Fundamental Secondary School, Pasadena High School, and Blair International Baccalaureate School for some high school home football games due to lack of resources on the respective campus fields. It has been the home of the annual two-day \"Bandfest\" for the Pasadena Tournament of Roses for many years. The Pasadena City College women's badminton team won AIAW national intercollegiate championships in 1972 and 1973, topping fields that included previous champions Long Beach State and Arizona State."

The Foothill campus (Community Education Center), located two miles east of the main campus, is an offsite facility where vocational training, some ESL courses, American Citizenship (known as \"Americanization\") courses, and the college's high school diploma program take place. In the Fall of 2013, the Pasadena Area Community College District established Pasadena City College at Rosemead (known as the Rosemead Campus), in efforts to provide more offerings to students throughout the district. In Spring of 2016, the college district approved of a new satellite campus on the grounds of John Muir High School called Pasadena City College Northwest campus (known as PCC Northwest) which offers career training programs and offering high school students opportunity in applying for college courses. A shuttle service from the main campus is available to the Foothill Campus."

        "content": "While at John Muir, Fred Phelps was profiled in Time magazine for preaching against \"sins committed on campus by students and teachers ... promiscuous petting ... evil language ... profanity ... cheating ... teachers' filthy jokes in classrooms ... [and] pandering to the lusts of the flesh\". Phelps later became leader of the Westboro Baptist Church. On March 20, 2003, on the day the United States launched Operation Iraqi Freedom, many students led by the Students for Social Justice, protested on campus against the war. Protesters went through the administration building requesting students to join their cause. Three students were arrested by campus police. On March 7, 2007, demonstrators from Philadelphia-based Repent America demonstrated on campus, leading to tensions between demonstrators and some students. PCC students, some who were journalism students and staff members of the campus newspaper, PCC Courier, were involved in the May Day melee at MacArthur Park. Students and faculty held a rally in support of the Jena Six on September 20, 2007. Some students were beaten and arrested at the MacArthur Park immigrant rights demonstration on May 1, 2007. During 2012 and 2013, the school became embroiled in conflict between students and faculty and the campus administration. On August 29, 2012, the PCC Board unilaterally cancelled the subsequent six-week winter session. One student was arrested at this board meeting. Organized by a newly formed group called Coalition of Students and Faculty for Student Achievement, a rally during the first week back of the illegitimate new Spring semester kicked off a steady wave of student and faculty activism. Eventually, course sections were cut, student transfers to four-year institutions were delayed, overall full-time student enrollments were reduced, and Proposition 30 monies allotted to the school were jeopardized. According to the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, 2012\u20132013 had the lowest full-time enrollments in 17 years at 20,219; Spring 2013 had the lowest full-time enrollments in 10 years at 9838 students.  The Faculty Association filed an unfair labor practice on the District for canceling winter abruptly and won in November 2013. The district filed an appeal to the ruling, thus prolonging the orders to rescind the trimester calendar and return to the status quo while ratcheting up annual 7% compensation to affected employees. In Spring 2013, in an unprecedented move, the Associated Students unanimously censured the administration and passed a vote of no confidence in the school's president, Mark W. Rocha, and collectively called for his immediate ouster. Separately, a vote among full-time faculty members expressed no confidence in Rocha by a margin of 92 percent to 8 percent. The Academic Faculty Senate also voted, 24\u20130, no confidence in the president. The board of trustees remained firm in their support of Rocha, extending his contract another year and giving Rocha a raise. In 2014, however, the faculty maintained its disapproval of the college president's performance as revealed in the faculty-wide evaluation of the PCC President. The negative campus climate has also been a concern with the staff and faculty, which prompted a campus-wide town hall sponsored by the faculty senate. Rocha was named one of Pasadena Weeklys less-than-stellar local \"turkey\" leaders of 2013. After a failed attempt to find work elsewhere, Rocha announced his retirement on August 7, 2014, but later became the Chancellor of San Francisco City College, where after less than three years he was placed on leave in March 2020, according to the San Francisco Examiner. In 2014, the Oscar-winning screenplay writer Dustin Lance Black was invited to speak at commencement, but in a controversial move he was subsequently uninvited by PCC Board of Trustees Anthony Fellow, who said, \"We just don't want to give PCC a bad name.\" According to the Los Angeles Times, \"School officials pretended that Black was never approved as commencement speaker, when in fact they approved him. They said that his brush with a sex scandal has 'no place in public discussion,' when in fact they discussed it with reporters, students and each other.\" The college issued an apology, and later re-extended the invitation."

The Town of Fogo Island encompasses Fogo, Joe Batt's Arm-Barr'd Islands-Shoal Bay, Seldom-Little Seldom and Tilting, with the unincorporated areas of Fogo Island. It lies off the northeast coast of Newfoundland, northwest of Musgrave Harbour across Hamilton Sound, just east of the Change Islands. The island is about  long and  wide. The total area is . The island had a population of 2,706 people in the 2006 census, 2,395 in the 2011 census, and 2,244 in the 2016 census. Though migratory French fishermen visited Fogo Island from the early 16th century until 1718, the first permanent settlement of the island took place in the 18th century. Fogo Harbour and Tilting Harbour were the first settlements on the island. The English and Irish descendants of the first inhabitants retained traces of their Elizabethan English and Old Irish dialects which can be heard on the island today. The island has many ancient folk customs brought from England and Ireland that are now disappearing."

        "title": "Fogo Island (Newfoundland and Labrador)_History",
        "content": "Fogo Island is one of the oldest named features on the coast of Newfoundland. The Bertius map from 1606 shows Fogo Island as one of only about a dozen important features around the coast of Newfoundland. On French maps of the 16th to 18th centuries, the island is referred to as Ile des Fougues. The island was likely named by Portuguese explorers and early fishing crews in the 16th century (Fogo means Fire in Portuguese). Until 1783 Fogo Island was on an area of the coast called the French Shore. Though English and Irish were not supposed to settle here, under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, they did settle, and by 1750 Fogo was a thriving part of the British mercantile system of fisheries, based out of West Country English towns such as Poole, in Dorset. Tilting Harbour on Fogo Island is a National Cultural Landscape District of Canada and is Newfoundland and Labrador's first Provincial Heritage District. Tilting is unique for its Irish culture and, some people say, its Irish dialect. The Irish Cemetery in Tilting may be the oldest in North America. Local oral history indicates that Tilting was originally a French harbour before becoming a venue of Irish settlement. This is highly likely, given the traditional commercial and cultural links between southern Irish and northern French fishing ports. The first Irish settled in Tilting in the 1750s, and uniquely for Newfoundland, Tilting evolved into an exclusively Irish and Catholic town by the 1780s. Beothuk traversed Fogo Island for many hundreds of years before Irish and English settlers arrived. The Beothuk pursued the seal and salmon fisheries in the area. They also travelled out to the Funk Islands to collect feathers and eggs from the birds there. In the early years of European settlement at Fogo, there were incidents of violence between the Beothuk and the Europeans. This contact ended around the year 1800. The Beothuk became extinct as a people in the late 1820s. Fogo Island first attracted Europeans because of the extensive opportunities for commodity harvesting, including seal skins and oil, lumber, fur-bearing animals, salmon and of course cod. Over time, settlers on the island concentrated on processing dried cod, mainly because that was the product that most interested the merchants who dealt in the region of Fogo. From about 1850 until the widespread depletion of fish stocks in the 1990s, cod was king. In recent years the economy of the island has seen diversification away from solely fishing to tourism and cultural industries. Fishing has always been a hard life. Before Confederation with Canada, the mercantile classes of St John's, Newfoundland became rich by holding a near-monopoly stranglehold on both the supply of goods to the Newfoundland outports and on the sale of fish from them. In the early 20th century, the Fisherman's Protective Union was formed in an attempt to break this stranglehold. It was a form of co-operative with general stores owned by fishermen for fishermen. One of the Fishermen's Union stores still stands at Seldom-Come-By on Fogo Island, now open as a museum complete with general store, port installations, fishing implements and equipment for the manufacture of cod-liver oil. Today the Fogo Island Cooperative continues to successfully stake footholds in new fish markets. Communities began recognising the appeal of their land and heritage as cultural tourism opportunities. Crab and lobster fisheries have largely replaced the cod fishery; a fish-packing plant remains in operation in the town of Fogo. A Marconi radio transmitting station was once operational atop a hill near the town of Fogo; operating with a spark-gap transmitter to establish maritime communications, the station was forced to close around the time that radio became common for household use as the spark-gap design generated unacceptable levels of radio interference. Efforts to rebuild this station as a historic site commenced in 2002. In 1967, the island played a key role in the development of what came to be known as the \"Fogo Process,\" a model for community media as a tool for addressing community concerns, when an Extension field worker from Memorial University, Fred Earle, and Colin Low shot 27 films with Fogo Islanders as part of the National Film Board of Canada's Challenge for Change program. Residents defeated the Smallwood Government's plans to resettle elsewhere  Fogo Islanders in the 1950s but by 1967 a downturn in the inshore fishery had forced many to turn to welfare support. The northern cod fishery closed in 1992. While the island did recover from the downturn\u2014in part owing to the Fogo Process\u2014the depleted state of the fishery adversely affected islanders for years to come."

European mariners often saw the burning fires of the Beothuk natives, when they were visiting from across the Atlantic. The island may have been named Fogo after the Cape Verde Island's active volcano. Note that many Newfoundland geographical features were named by the Spanish, the Portuguese and the French before anglophones (the English, the Irish and the Scots) arrived. Cape Bonavista, Cape Spear, Cape Race, Trinity Bay, Placentia Bay, Notre Dame Bay, Cape St Francis, Baccalieu Island, Baie Verte, Taslow, Baie l'Argente and even St John's or Catalina are place names that were originally named by non-English-speakers."

The current settlement was formed in the early 13th century. It was first mentioned in documents in 1350. After Polish rule, it was ruled by the Margraviate of Brandenburg and Bohemia (Czechia). Its original Slavic (Polish) name Urad remained official until 1608, when it was Germanized. Despite the annexation of the territory by Brandenburg, the village was still inhabited by Poles in the 17th century, and there were church services in the Polish language. From the 18th century, it was part of Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was also part of Germany. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, in 1945, along with the right-bank Lubusz Land (portion situated east of the Oder River) the majority of the village became again part of Poland, and its original name was restored.

It also included a separate Anglo-Dutch commercial agreement. Negotiations had been in progress since late 1666 but were slow, as both sides tried to improve their positions. This changed after the French invasion of the Spanish Netherlands in late May, which the Dutch viewed as a more serious threat. War-weariness in England was increased by the June Raid on the Medway. Both factors led to a rapid agreement of terms. Prior to 1667, the Anglo-Dutch relationship had been dominated by commercial conflict, which the treaty did not end entirely. However, tensions decreased markedly and cleared the way for the 1668 Triple Alliance between the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden. With the brief anomaly of the 1672 to 1674 Third Anglo-Dutch War, the treaty marked the beginning of an alliance between the English and the Dutch that would last for a century."

        "content": "The Second Anglo-Dutch War was caused by commercial tensions, heightened by Charles II, who saw trade as a way to reduce his financial dependence on Parliament. In 1660, he and his brother James founded the Royal African Company (RAC), challenging the Dutch in West Africa. Investors included senior politicians such as George Carteret, Shaftesbury and Arlington, creating a strong link between the RAC and government policy. Huge profits from Asian spices led to conflict even in times of peace, as the Dutch East India Company, or VOC, first created, then enforced, their monopoly over production and trade. By 1663, indigenous and European competitors like the Portuguese had been eliminated, leaving only nutmeg plantations on Run. These had been established by the British East India Company in 1616, before being evicted by the VOC in 1620; when the English re-occupied Run in late 1664, the Dutch expelled them again, this time destroying the plantations. There was a similar struggle over the Atlantic trade between the Dutch West-Indische Compagnie, or WIC, and competitors from Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Portugal and England. Sugar plantations in the Americas were cultivated by slaves from Africa, fed by colonies in North America, leading to conflict in all three regions. In August 1664, the English occupied New Netherland, later renamed New York; when another attack captured WIC slave trade posts in modern Ghana, the Dutch sent a fleet to recapture them. The result was to bankrupt the RAC, whose investors saw war as the best way to recoup their losses. Despite the Franco-Dutch treaty of April 1662, Louis XIV initially remained neutral, as French and Dutch economic interests increasingly diverged over the Spanish Netherlands. The 1648 Peace of M\u00fcnster permanently closed the Scheldt estuary, giving Amsterdam effective control of trade in North-West Europe. Louis considered the Spanish Netherlands his by right of marriage to Maria Theresa of Spain but hoped to acquire them peacefully. Negotiations with the Dutch continually broke down over Antwerp; by 1663, he concluded they would never make concessions voluntarily and began planning a military intervention. In early 1665, England signed an alliance with Sweden against the Dutch, who suffered a serious defeat at Lowestoft in June, followed by an invasion from M\u00fcnster. Louis responded by activating the 1662 treaty, calculating this would make it harder for the Dutch to oppose his occupation of the Spanish Netherlands. He also paid Sweden to remain neutral, while influencing Denmark\u2013Norway to join the war. Danish assistance saved the Dutch merchant fleet at the Battle of V\u00e5gen in August, although this turned out to have been the result of miscommunication. Frederick III of Denmark had secretly agreed to help the English capture the fleet in return for a share of the profits, but his instructions arrived too late. By late 1666, Charles was short of money, largely due to his refusal to recall Parliament, while English trade had been badly affected by the war and domestic disasters. In contrast, the Dutch economy had largely recovered from its post-1665 contraction, while public debt was lower in 1667 than 1652; however, naval warfare was enormously expensive and financing it a challenge even for the Amsterdam markets. Both sides wanted peace, since the Dutch had little to gain from continuing the war and faced external challenges from competitors. Denmark resented concessions imposed at Christianopel in 1647, while the WIC's confiscation of Danish ships was an ongoing source of dispute; in early 1667, they joined Sweden and France in imposing tariffs on Dutch goods, impacting the Baltic grain trade. In October 1666, Charles opened discussions with the States-General of the Netherlands, under the pretext of arrangements to return the body of Vice-Admiral William Berkeley, killed in the Four Days' Battle. He invited the Dutch to negotiations in London and withdrew previous demands for the appointment of his nephew William of Orange as stadtholder, payment of damages, the return of Run and a trade deal on India. The States-General refused to attend peace talks without France; on territorial claims, they offered to continue the present situation, or revert to the position before the war, an option clearly unacceptable to the English. It is questionable how sincere this offer from Charles actually was, since his envoy in Paris, the Earl of St Albans, was simultaneously holding secret talks on an Anglo-French alliance. Louis agreed to ensure the Dutch complied with English demands, in exchange for a free hand in the Spanish Netherlands; by April 1667, diplomats in The Hague were predicting a deal was imminent. When talks eventually began, the English delegation felt their position was extremely strong."

        "content": "Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt and the States of Holland rejected English proposals to negotiate in The Hague, a town dominated by the Orangist opposition. They were supported by Louis, who viewed the Orangists as English agents. Angered by the delay, the States of Zeeland, Gelderland, Groningen, Overijssel and Friesland threatened to stop paying for a war 'continued only by Holland's obstinacy.' The parties eventually settled on Breda, but French military preparations led the Orangists to accuse De Witt of deliberately stalling to allow Louis a free hand in the Spanish Netherlands. This put De Witt under pressure to reach agreement, which increased after France and Portugal agreed an anti-Spanish alliance in March. The role of mediator in peace talks provided prestige and the opportunity to build relationships; since Louis and Leopold both wanted the position, they compromised by using Swedish diplomats. Key players in the vital Baltic trade in grain, iron and shipping supplies, the Swedes hoped to remove commercial concessions imposed by the Republic in the 1656 Treaty of Elbing and end its alliance with Denmark. G\u00f6ran Fleming was based at Breda, with Peter Coyet in The Hague; after Coyet died on 8 June, he was replaced by Count Dohna, who was instructed to negotiate a Swedish-English-French alliance if talks at Breda failed. The States General appointed eight delegates but only those from Holland, Zeeland and Friesland were actually present. Two of the three were Orangists, Zeelandic Pensionary Pieter de Huybert and Friesland's van Jongestall; the delegate from Holland, Van Beverningh, was a member of De Witt's States Party. The English lead negotiators were Denzil Holles,  Ambassador to France, and Henry Coventry, Ambassador to Sweden. On 24 May, Louis launched the War of Devolution, French troops quickly occupying much of the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comt\u00e9. To focus on this, Spain needed to end the long-running Portuguese Restoration War. On 27 May, the Anglo-Spanish Treaty of Madrid formally concluded the 1654 to 1660 war and in return for commercial concessions, England agreed to mediate with Portugal. The threat to the Dutch economy presented by French expansion made ending the Anglo-Dutch War a matter of urgency. Backed by assurances from Louis that he would force the Dutch to agree concessions, the English increased their demands and Van Beverningh told De Witt a major military victory was needed to improve their bargaining position. An opportunity was provided by Charles, who decommissioned most of the Royal Navy in late 1666 as a cost-saving measure. The Dutch took full advantage in the June Medway Raid; although the action itself had limited strategic impact, it was a humiliation Charles never forgot. Holles and Coventry initially assumed this would extend negotiations, but the need to create an alliance against France meant Spain threatened to withhold implementation of the Madrid treaty, supported by Leopold. Combined with economic losses caused by the war and the Great Fire of London, Clarendon instructed Holles to agree terms \"to calm people's minds\" and \"free the king from a burden...he is finding hard to bear\"."

        "content": "Article 1 of the treaty stipulated a limited military alliance, obliging fleets or single ships sailing on the same course to defend each other against a third party. Article 3 established the principle of uti possidetis, or \"what you have, you hold\", with an effective date of 20 May. The Dutch regained Surinam, now part of modern Suriname, while the English kept New Netherland, which was subsequently divided into the colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Delaware. Articles 4 to 8 applied the same principle to losses of goods or ships, including those that occurred before the war. No indemnities could be levied or punishments imposed, but all existing Letters of Marque were declared void. To allow time to communicate these instructions, Article 7 varied the date on which they would be enforced: 5 September for the English Channel and the North Sea, 5 October for the other European seas, 2 November for the African coast north of the Equator and 24 April 1668 for the rest of the world. Article 10 required all prisoners to be exchanged without ransom although the Dutch later demanded reimbursement of their living expenses, which the English viewed as the same thing. After their failed 1666 coup, many Orangists sought refuge in England, with English and Scots dissidents going the other way. In Articles 13 and 17, both sides undertook not to protect each other's rebels; in a secret annex, the Dutch undertook to extradite regicides who voted for the Execution of Charles I in 1649, although in practice these provisions were ignored. A separate treaty amended the Navigation Acts; goods transported along the Rhine or Scheldt to Amsterdam could be carried by Dutch ships to England without being subject to tariffs. England also accepted the principle of \"free ships make free goods\", which prevented the Royal Navy from intercepting Dutch ships during wars in which the Dutch were neutral. These terms were preliminary, with a definitive text signed on 17 February 1668. The Danish and French treaties followed the Anglo-Dutch version in waiving claims for restitution of losses. In addition, England returned the French possessions of Cayenne and Acadia, captured in 1667 and 1654 respectively, but the exact boundaries were not specified, and the handover was delayed until 1670. England regained Montserrat and Antigua, with the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts divided between both countries. After the treaties were signed on 31 July, they were sent to each country for ratification, a process which was completed by 24 August and followed by public celebrations in Breda."

        "content": "By exchanging New Netherland and Run, Breda removed two major areas of dispute, reducing Anglo-Dutch tensions overall and clearing the way for the 1668 Triple Alliance between the Republic, Sweden and England. The Alliance is often credited with forcing France to return most of their gains at Aix-la-Chapelle, whereas the terms had already been agreed by Louis and Leopold in January 1668. In the longer term, Breda was the point when the English and Dutch came to view France as a greater threat than each other; although Charles' preference for a French alliance led to the 1670 Secret Treaty of Dover, the long-term trend was against him. Support for re-asserting English naval power provided limited backing in the Third Anglo-Dutch War but ended once that had been achieved. The treaty disappointed Orangists by failing to restore the House of Orange or allow exiles home, as promised by Charles. When Zeeland and Friesland, in response to the French advance, proposed William be made Captain-General of the Dutch States Army, the States of Holland responded on 5 August with the Perpetual Edict. This abolished the position of Stadholder of Holland, while a second resolution agreed to oppose that any confederate Captain-General or Admiral-General would become stadtholder of another province. Since the army was viewed as an Orangist power base, spending on it was deliberately minimised; this had catastrophic effects in 1672. Breda was also a success for Sweden, who used their position as mediators to improve the Elbing provisions, break the Dutch-Danish agreement and join the Triple Alliance. The Spanish regained Franche-Comt\u00e9 and most of the Spanish Netherlands; more significantly, the Dutch now viewed them as a better neighbour than an ambitious France. Overall, the Dutch considered Breda and the creation of the Alliance a diplomatic triumph; the period immediately following is often considered the high point of the Dutch Golden Age."

At the 2016 Census Wantirna had a population of 13,818. Its name is derived from the local aboriginal population's meaning for, \"a gurgling stream\". The Knox Private Hospital, Westfield Knox shopping centre, and Kieran are located in Wantirna. The EastLink tollway runs through Wantirna with interchanges at Boronia Road and Burwood Highway. Wantirna was first settled by Australians of European descent in 1840 when Mrs. Madeline Scott established the \"Bushy Park\" cattle run on the banks of the Dandenong Creek. During the 1870s other pioneers opened up the area to settlement. In 1912 the need for a school to serve the local area soon became apparent in this small but fast-growing area; the Finger family donated two acres of land on the southern side of Mountain Hwy (then known as Wantirna-Sassafras Rd) and a timber schoolhouse was opened. The Finger and Fankhauser families were prime movers in the erection of the Methodist Church opened opposite the school in May 1914, and a parish hall was built on Burwood Highway in 1924. Wantirna Post Office opened on 1 November 1913, closed in 1977, and reopened in 1983. The Wantirna Reserve was provided by the council in 1925 and a tennis court was built there shortly afterwards. In December 1939, after the outbreak of World War II, West Prussia Road was renamed Wantirna Road. Locations in Wantirna, especially Westfield Knox, are occasionally used to shoot the soap opera Neighbours. Koomba Park is a large native bushland park spanning the area between Dandenong Creek and the Eastlink Tollway. It is run by Parks Victoria and was opened in 1982. The Victorian Jazz Archive is located within Koomba Park."

        "content": "During the 18th and early 19th centuries Oneida Lake and its tributary Wood Creek were part of the Albany-Oswego waterway from the Atlantic seaboard westward via the Hudson River and through the Appalachian Mountains via the Mohawk River; travel westward then was by portage over the Oneida Carry to the Wood Creek-Oneida Lake system. The navigable waterway exited Oneida Lake by the Oneida River, which led to the Oswego River and Lake Ontario, from where travelers could reach the other Great Lakes. Following the American Revolutionary War, the United States forced the Iroquois nations to cede most of their lands in that region, as most of them had allied with the British, who were defeated. In addition, demand from settlers created pressure for such cessions. White settlers improved the natural waterway by constructing a canal with locks within Wood Creek to Oneida Lake. This system was significantly improved\u2014from 1792 to 1803\u2014by cutting a canal across the Oneida Carry, after which commercial shipping across Oneida Lake increased substantially. Even more significant was the completion in 1825 of the Erie Canal, which bypassed the Oneida Lake system and enhanced travel through the entire Mohawk Valley. This caused the population around the lake to lose their navigable waterway eastward. In 1835 Oneida Lake was connected to the Erie Canal system by construction of the (old) Oneida Canal, which ran about  from Higginsville on the Erie Canal northward to Wood Creek, about  upstream of Oneida Lake. Built poorly with wooden locks, the Oneida Canal was closed in 1863. When the Erie Canal was redesigned and reconstructed to form the New York State Barge Canal in the early 20th century, the engineers made use of natural rivers and lakes where possible. The new barges were powered internally (by diesel or steam engines), so they could travel open water and against a current; the system no longer needed infrastructure for drawing vessels externally \u2014 i.e., drawpaths and draft animals. After it straightened Fish Creek on the east, the new canalway entered Oneida Lake at Sylvan Beach and exited west with the Oneida River at Brewerton. New terminal walls at Sylvan Beach, Cleveland, and Brewerton allowed barges to load and unload cargo and to stay overnight. A new break wall was installed, preventing lake waves from entering the canal and protecting against shoaling. These improvements provided towns along the shoreline of Oneida Lake with access again to navigable waterways east and west."

Jackels completed a Doctorate in Sacred Theology at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome in 1989. On April 4, 2005, he was consecrated bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wichita, USA. The Archdiocese of Dubuque is one of only a handful of US archdioceses not based in a major metropolitan area.  The archdiocese contains 199 parishes and has three Catholic colleges: Loras College and Clarke University in Dubuque and Mount Mercy University in Cedar Rapids. A number of religious orders maintain a presence in the archdiocese. Notable orders include the Trappist monastery New Melleray Abbey (male) southwest of Dubuque, and the Trappistine monastery Our Lady of the Mississippi Abbey (female) south of Dubuque. The archdiocese is also home to the motherhouse of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The Basilica of St. Francis Xavier is located in the archdiocese, located in Dyersville, about  west of Dubuque."

        "content": "During the years prior to the founding of the Dubuque Diocese, the area was under the jurisdiction of a number of bishops.  Many of these were purely academic as no Catholic presence yet existed in the area.  Most notable among these was the St. Louis Diocese under Bishop Rosati.  During the early 1830s it was under his jurisdiction that the early missionaries arrived in what would become the state of Iowa. In the 1830s, the church studied how to address the expansion of the United States into the western frontiers.  Those conducting the study recommended to the pope that three new dioceses be created, one of which was the Dubuque Diocese. Father Charles Fitzmaurice established the Saint Raphael's parish at Dubuque in 1833.  This was the first church of any Christian denomination in the territory that would become the state of Iowa. Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli was one of the most famous missionaries to work in the Dubuque area.  He established a number of parishes in Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin; several were named after the Archangels: Saint Raphael's in Dubuque, Saint Michael's at Galena, Illinois, and Saint Gabriel's at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin.  Pope John Paul II declared Father Mazzuchelli Venerable in 1993, and his case for sainthood is pending."

Loras gathered funds and personnel for the new diocese, and he arrived in 1839. St. Raphael's became the cathedral parish in August of that year. He oversaw the expansion of the church in the early years of the diocese, first in the Iowa territory, then after 1846 in the new state of Iowa. Bishop Loras encouraged immigration to the area, especially German and Irish settlers. He oversaw the creation of new parishes and also he invited several religious orders to the area. This included the Cistercian order that built the New Melleray Monastery south of Dubuque. Shortly before his death, he directed the construction of the third structure to house St. Raphael's Cathedral which remains today. A second catholic parish was planned as the Uptown Catholic Parish to be located on the west side of Main Street between 7th and 8th streets in Dubuque. Loras planned the parish due to crowded conditions at the Cathedral. A cornerstone was laid for the parish church, but construction work never proceeded past the laying of the foundation. In 1850, Pope Pius IX separated territory from the Diocese of Dubuque to form the new Diocese of Saint Paul, serving Minnesota Territory (later Minnesota and the Dakotas)."

Clement Smyth, OCSO served as bishop from February 1858 to September 1865  and oversaw continued expansion of the Catholic Church in the diocese.  During his episcopacy the German Catholics of the city of Dubuque began construction of a new Saint Mary's church to replace the too-small Church of the Holy Trinity. In 1863, Smyth learned of the existence of the pro-Southern Knights of the Golden Circle, with headquarters in Dubuque. He gave members who might be Catholic two weeks to withdraw from the organization or be automatically excommunicated. After Bishop Smyth died in 1865, John Hennessey succeeded him as Bishop of Dubuque.  During Hennessey's tenure, the population of Dubuque exploded as the Milwaukee Railroad Shops came to the city.  Hennessey created several parishes in Dubuque: Sacred Heart, Holy Ghost, St. Anthony's, and Holy Trinity to deal with this population explosion. During this time, Bishop Hennessey proposed separating territory from the diocese to create a new diocese for southern Iowa.  While he proposed Des Moines as the seat of the new diocese, Pope Leo XIII selected Davenport as the site. Nicholas E. Gonner (1835\u20131892), a Catholic immigrant from Luxembourg, founded the Catholic Publishing Company of Dubuque. His son Nicholas E. Gonner (1835\u20131892) took over in 1892, editing two German language weeklies, an English language weekly, and the Daily Tribune, the only Catholic daily newspaper ever published in the United States. On June 15, 1893, Pope Leo XIII elevated the Dubuque Diocese to an archdiocese, and Bishop Hennessey became the first archbishop.  Archbishop Hennessey died in 1900 and was buried at the cathedral."

A collector of fine art pieces, he had placed a number of art pieces in a museum at Columbia (now Loras) College and perhaps, thinking he could gain funds to further his collection, involved the archdiocese in what turned out to be a dubious gold mine scheme. Beckman signed notes on behalf of the archdiocese, which suffered a loss of more than $500,000 when the scheme fell apart and the perpetrator of the scheme (Phillip Suetter, of California) was arrested. President Roosevelt directed the FBI to investigate Beckman to determine his role in the financial scheme. Most of Beckman's collection was sold to pay the notes. Because of Beckman's troubles, Bishop Henry Rohlman returned from the Davenport, Iowa, diocese to become coadjutor archbishop in 1944. Beckman was allowed to retain his office, but was informed that Rohlman now led the archdiocese. Beckman retired in 1947, and left Dubuque for Cincinnati. On December 7, 1941, Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. One of the casualties in that attack was Father Aloysius Schmitt, a priest of the archdiocese, who was serving on board the USS Oklahoma.  The boat capsized during the attack, leaving Schmitt and other men trapped below with only a small porthole for escape. Schmitt declined to be pulled from the ship, and instead helped other men, twelve in all, to escape, but perished himself. Schmitt was the first chaplain of any denomination to die in World War II. For his actions, he was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and a destroyer was named in his honor."

At 36, he had become the youngest president of St. Procopius College (now known as Benedictine University).  His background in education led Vatican officials, including the pope, to seek his advice. During Kucera's tenure as archbishop, he remodeled St. Raphael's Cathedral, revised and published the guidelines for the sacrament of Confirmation, reduced the number of deaneries from 16 to 14, reorganized the structure of the archdiocese and created an archbishop's cabinet to coordinate administration of the archdiocese. In 1987, Kucera also launched a plan that divided the archdiocese into three regions with a resident bishop in each. The Dubuque Region was served by retired Archbishop James Byrne and Archbishop Kucera; the Cedar Rapids Region by Bishop Francis Dunn, and Waterloo Region by Fr. William Franklin who was consecrated as a bishop in April 1987. However, Bishop Kucera eventually dropped the plan after the death of Bishop Dunn in 1989 and Bishop Franklin's nomination as the head of the Diocese of Davenport. In 1986 the archdiocese celebrated the 150th anniversary of its founding; Archbishop Kucera received an honorary degree from the University of Dubuque.  On October 16, 1995, Archbishop Kucera retired, moved to Aurora, Colorado, and then subsequently returned to live in Dubuque."

There has been much controversy recently about how to best run the schools. The administrators of the system had recently made plans to reorganize the schools. This was due to factors such as a declining number of students attending Catholic schools. An especially controversial move that was proposed was to turn St. Anthony's school into a central school for certain grades. Parents of the parish felt that their concerns were being ignored.

The parish is part of a cluster of several other rural parishes in northern Dubuque County, Iowa, that share a pastor and other facilities. The parish traces its history back to 1858. A number of area residents had petitioned Bishop Mathias Loras to establish a Catholic parish in the Balltown area. Loras came to the area and offered Mass in a log cabin near Balltown. Residents gathered the funds to build a church and school. In 1891, local resident Andreas Rapp and his wife donated some land, which allowed for the construction of a brick building containing a school and a convent for the sisters, as well as the establishment of a cemetery.  The school opened in September of that year with 45 children attending. Another local resident, Peter Cremer, donated land for a new church, and in 1892 the cornerstone for the second St. Francis Church building was laid. The second St. Francis Church building would serve the parish until August 27, 1976, when lightning struck the steeple, causing a fire which destroyed the church building. In the aftermath a new St. Francis Church was constructed, while the old convent building was torn down to make room for the new church."

The offices for both parishes are located at St. John's.  The archdiocese has indicated that when Fr.

Prior to this, residents living in the Sherrill area needed to travel to Dubuque about 15 miles away to attend Mass, a considerable distance at the time.  In response to the need for a local church to accommodate the heavy German Catholic immigration to the rural districts surrounding Sherrill, Dubuque Bishop Mathias Loras established the parish. By the 1860s the name of Saints Peter and Paul had been adopted, and in 1889 the original wooden church was replaced by a large, brick and stone Romanesque Revival structure, which remains in use today. During the 1970s, the church's original carved wood altars were removed and its 19th-century wood trim was painted over. Recently parish members completed a renovation of the building that restored the wood trim and added decorative details suggestive of its past. Inscriptions on the church's stained glass windows and on the older headstones in its adjoining cemetery are in German, reflecting the culture of the parish's founding members. For well over 100 years the parish school was operated by the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration (FSPA) of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and many girls of the parish who felt a calling to religious life joined that order. The school is still operated on the premises of the parish by the Archdiocese of Dubuque, as a consolidation of the original school and the Catholic school which once served the nearby community of Balltown, Iowa."

        "content": "Shortly after their marriage in 1873, Samuel Barnett and his wife, Henrietta, moved to the Whitechapel district of the East End of London. Barnett worked as a vicar at St Jude's church, where he saw poverty at first hand. Late-Victorian Whitechapel was known for its overcrowded living spaces and high criminal activity. In the area of Whitechapel alone, the mortality rate for children under the age of five was around 60% mostly due to the tight living conditions. Charles Booth, another social reformer, mapped London according to eight different social classes, finding that around 70% of people living in the East End were in the lowest three classes. Whitechapel was also a place where many different immigrants settled. The Great Famine of Ireland in the 19th century led to many Irish settling in Whitechapel. Also, many Jewish immigrants settled in Whitechapel after fleeing from persecution in Western Europe at the time. The Barnetts used their roles in the parish to improve the Whitechapel area. They built a church library, introduced art exhibits, brought university lecturers in, and took their parishioners on excursions to the homes of the wealthy and to universities. The Barnetts also tried to encourage officials to improve sanitation and housing and to build more playgrounds and washhouses. However, the attempts the Barnetts made with the parish had little effect on the East End community as a whole. The parish did not reach everyone that lived in the East End. Many of the people did not involve themselves with the established church. In an effort to improve the wellbeing of the community, Barnett had the idea of sharing knowledge and culture. His proposal was to have university students come as volunteers to share their knowledge: the students would be able to help the poor, and at the same time witness poverty at first hand, and potentially develop solutions for it. In 1883, Barnett gave a lecture at St John's College, Oxford to gain support for his idea. Barnett was able to gather enough support and a committee called the \"University Settlement of East London\" was set up by Oxford. With these ideas and the support of universities, Barnett founded Toynbee Hall, the first settlement house in the world. Named after another social reformer, Arnold Toynbee, Toynbee Hall first opened its doors on Christmas Eve in 1884. Samuel Barnett was named as the first warden of the hall and Oxford and Cambridge university students came to work at the hall. By 1910 more settlement houses were founded in England in the areas of Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Birmingham, Liverpool, and elsewhere in London; as well as in Holland, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, and the United States. In 1911 the leaders of the social settlement movement founded the National Federation of Settlements. One of the best known settlement houses that was inspired after a visit to Toynbee Hall is Hull House in Chicago, founded by Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr in 1889. Over time Toynbee Hall implemented many different educational community programmes. At its opening, Toynbee Hall introduced University Extension Society lectures. These lectures were taught by university professors. At the programme's peak, in the 1890s, classes were taught in over 134 topics including; literature, zoology, ethics, philosophy, etc. In order to further promote education, 36 societies or clubs were created in different areas, such as, music, art, history, and science. One of these societies was founded in 1889 and was called the \"Toynbee Travellers\". This group was created after a group of Toynbee Hall residents travelled to Belgium in 1887. Toynbee Hall also began hosting Smoking Room Debates in which community members and invited speakers would come to debate issues of the day. This tradition continued for over twenty years. In 1899, the Poor Man's Lawyer service was introduced. This programme gives free legal services to those who can not afford it, and continues to the present day."

        "content": "The international settlement movement began at Toynbee Hall, where a community centre was formed that attracted university students who wished to live or \"settle\" among the underprivileged in London's economically depressed East End. They came, according to Samuel Barnett, \"to learn, as much as to teach, to receive as much as to give\". As at most settlement houses, its social workers\u2014students from Oxford and Cambridge Universities, among others\u2014resided at Toynbee Hall and sought thereby to get to know their neighbors and their needs on a more intimate, personal level. Toynbee Hall rejected the concept of a community centre as a location for Christian proselytisingas seen in the efforts of the Salvation Army. This principle is reflected in the decision to name it after the social reformer, Arnold Toynbee, who had died in 1883, aged 30. As Henrietta Barnett explained, the name would be \"free from every possible savor of a mission.\" From the beginning, it was non-sectarian and welcomed people of all faiths, despite having been founded by a Church of England cleric. It saw its purpose as more educational than charitable, in a missionary sense. Gertrude Himmelfarb lists some of the activities offered by Toynbee Hall in a typical month: \"evening classes on arithmetic, writing, drawing, citizenship, chemistry, nursing, and music (...); afternoon classes for girls on dressmaking, writing and composition, geography, bookkeeping, needlework, hygiene, reading and recitation, French, singing, cooking, and swimming; and evening sessions devoted to the discussion of legal principles and current social issues\". By 1900 there were over 100 settlements in the United States and across the UK, and in 1911 the leaders of the social settlement movement founded the National Federation of Settlements."

Visitors to Toynbee Hall included Lenin and Guglielmo Marconi. The latter made the first public presentation of his wireless invention in Toynbee Hall on December 12, 1896. Lionel Ellis (1885\u20131970), the military historian, was an Associate Warden of Toynbee Hall after the Second World War. Between the two World Wars, he had been General Secretary of the National Council of Social Service and then Secretary of the National Fitness Council. John Profumo dedicated much of his time to the Hall from the 1960s onwards after the Profumo affair forced him out of politics. Social reformers from the United States, such as Jane Addams and Gaylord Starin White, visited Toynbee Hall, which inspired their work to establish Hull House in Chicago and Union Settlement in New York City, respectively. Sir Nicolas Bratza, was a volunteer at Toynbee Hall's Free Legal Advice Centre in the 1970s. He went on to become the President of the European Court of Human Rights from November 2011 to October 2012. In 2014, Sir Nicolas became an Ambassador for Toynbee Hall. Marie-Jeanne Bassot visited Hull House, which inspired her establishment of la R\u00e9sidence sociale in Levallois-Perret (France)."

        "content": "Falfield is a village, located near the northern border of the South Gloucestershire district of Gloucestershire, England on the southern edge of the Berkeley Vale, to the east of the River Severn and just falling into the boundary of the Cotswolds. It is the last parish on the northern boundary of South Gloucestershire. The area has a Wotton-under-Edge (GL12) post code and so is often incorrectly listed as being in the Stroud district of Gloucestershire. Falfield is one of the longest villages in England, alongside local village Cromhall. There are approximately 200 houses in the village with a population of some 500, increasing to 762 at the 2011 census. The nearest town to the village is Thornbury approximately 7 miles to the south. The nearest major cities are Bristol 16 miles to the South and Gloucester 18 miles to the North, and is often referred to as the midpoint between the two. Falfield is clustered mainly along the A38 road. It is also the first stop from Junction 14 of the M5. The shape of the parish is long in its length and narrow in its width. Both the A38 and M5 run through the village from north to south. It has a large garden centre, and two prisons (Eastwood Park and Leyhill) nearby. The village also includes St George's Church, The Huntsman Inn, a village hall, a small shop, a car dealership and several farms as well as 1st Falfield Scout Association who are celebrating their 40th anniversary in 2013 and 1st Falfield & Stone Brownies part of Girlguiding who are celebrating their 20th anniversary in 2016. Falfield St George's Church is famous for being the burial place of Conservative politician Sir George Jenkinson, who died in 1892. Politically, Falfield comes under the constituency of Thornbury & Yate, which is currently a Conservative Party seat held by Luke Hall."

        "content": "A Saxon charter signifies that village was originally an ancient settlement. In 1608 a document \"Men & Armour\",  compiled by John Smyth (1567\u20131641), the Steward of the Gloucestershire lands of Lord Berkeley, recorded that the majority of the men in the village were weavers and others being husbandmen (farmers) or tailors. Ecclesiastically the village was part of the Thornbury Parish and was served by a Chapel of Ease, which was recorded as being dilapidated during the 18th century. In 1860 the present St George's Church was built a short distance from where the Chapel of Ease stood. The organist Charles Harford Lloyd served in the village in his youth. Registers containing marriages, baptisms and burials at Falfield Parish Church are in existence from 1860. Prior to this date they are included under Thornbury Parish records. Anciently a settlement called \"Mars\" was associated with Falfield. However it has not been determined where this settlement existed, despite research. A large part of the village is Eastwood Park, anciently a deer park belonging to Thornbury Castle in the 16th century. Later names associated with owners of Eastwood were Tyndale, Ashfield, Rogers, Jenkinson and Watts. More recently it came into the ownership of the Ministry of Defence followed by the Department of Health and is now run as a Conference and Training Centre. Other older constructions in the village are: Green Farm whose origins are medieval, Heneage Farm - 16th century, Sundayshill Farm probably 17th century, Oakhall Farm, Moorslade Farm where a more modern building has now replaced the older farmhouse mentioned in 16th century documents. Whitfield House and Pool Farm in Whitfield are also worthy of mention. Brinkmarsh Farm, now (quite recently) demolished was a fine Elizabethan building with ball finials. In what is known as Mill Lane is a mill which has been on the present site for four or five hundred years, probably longer. A women's prison, HM Prison Eastwood Park, is located in the Falfield area. The village appears to lack a manor house, possibly Heneage Court could have been such, but little of its history is known. Cannonballs found in the roof suggest its existence in the 16th century. Names connected with Heneage Court are: Skey, Hale, Montague Williams and Russell Thomas. Edward Warren laid out the gardens, pleasure grounds and woodland for Russell Thomas in 1913."

        "content": "The Saura, a Native American tribe of the North Carolina Piedmont region, knew the mountain as Jomeokee meaning the Great Guide. It served as a guidepost also for the European settlers of the Carolina who similarly named it Pilot. Due to the effects of European diseases and attacks by northern Indians, particularly the Seneca, the Saura Indians abandoned the area around 1700. The first European settlers in the area arrived in the late 1740s from Pennsylvania. Settlement in the area was slow due to its isolation. There are numerous accounts in the Records of the Moravians in North Carolina  which related to groups of highwaymen, or bandits, who used the mountains as a refuge throughout the 1750s and 1760s. After serving as a commercial tourist attraction, Pilot Mountain became a North Carolina state park in 1968. It was established as a state park in order to protect the mountain and surrounding lands from being overdeveloped. The Pilot Mountain Preservation and Park Committee purchased the land from Mrs. J. W. Beasley by raising funds and acquired a grant from the federal government. Additional lands along the Yadkin River were purchased in 1970. Further purchases have brought Pilot Mountain State Park to a total size of 3,703\u00a0acres (14.99\u00a0km2). On November 8, 2012 a prescribed burn of 70 acres got out of control leading to a wildfire on the mountain's steep western slope. In November 27, 2021, a massive wildfire broke out across Pilot Mountain State Park that has since grown to over 300 acres."

Activities at the park include, camping, canoeing, fishing, rock climbing, picnicking, hiking,  and environmental education. The Yadkin River provides opportunities for visitors to the park to fish and canoe. The Yadkin River Canoe Trail is 165\u00a0mile (265\u00a0km) long and follows the course of the river to its confluence with the Uwharrie River at the Pee Dee River in south central North Carolina. Two miles (3.22\u00a0km) of the river pass through Pilot Mountain State Park. The river is broad and shallow at the park with two islands that can be reached by canoe or by wading when the water level is low. All anglers need to have a license from the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission. The common game fish are sunfish, catfish and crappie. A family camping area is on the lower slopes of Pilot Mountain. It has 49 campsites that are open to tents or trailers that are scattered in a forest of hickory and oak trees. Each campsite comes equipped with a charcoal grill, picnic table and tent pad. Modern restroom facilities with hot water and showers are located nearby. A large and rustic youth group camping area is located on the north side of the park's Yadkin River Section. Canoeists are not permitted to camp on the islands of the river. A designated canoe campsite on the bank is available by reservation by contacting the park office. There are three picnic areas at Pilot Mountain State Park. One picnic area is near the summit parking lot and two are near the Yadkin River. The area has many picnic tables and grills. No drinking water is available in this area. Pit toilets are available. Rock climbing is permitted in some designated sections of the park. All climbers must register with park staff. Climbing and rappelling are not permitted on the face of Pilot Mountain, Big Pinnacle.

When the school began classes in 1899, there were 125 students and an 18-member faculty. The first building was finished in 1899 and is called Old Main, though it is formally named the Livingston C. Lord Administration Building in honor of EIU's first president, who served from 1899 to 1933. Built of Indiana limestone in a heavy Gothic revival style with turrets, towers, and battlements, its distinctive outline is the official symbol of the school. Old Main is one of \"Altgeld's castles\", five buildings built in the 1890s at the major Illinois state colleges.  Governor John Peter Altgeld was instrumental in funding the Illinois university system, and he was especially fond of the Gothic style. Eastern's \"Old Main\"  and Illinois State University's Cook Hall are the only schools where the \"castle\" is not named after Altgeld. Other original Gothic Revival buildings include Booth Library and Blair Hall.  Blair Hall was restored after a disastrous fire in 2004. In fall 2008, the university opened the newly constructed Doudna Fine Arts Center,  designed by international architect Antoine Predock.  The  complex houses the music, theatre, and visual arts departments. Through the twentieth century, the school changed its name several times in order to reflect its transition from a teachers college into a multi-purpose institution that could be of wider service to Illinois. Thus, Eastern Illinois State Normal School became Eastern Illinois State Teachers College in 1921, which then became Eastern Illinois State College in 1947. In 1957, the Illinois General Assembly changed the name of the institution to Eastern Illinois University."

At the top, the Great Bras d'Or Channel connects to the ocean via a navigable channel. The maximum depth is  in the East Bay. It sits in 3,500 square kilometer drainage basin. The western side is generally shallow, and is part of an extensive drumlin field. Steep hills rise abruptly on the northwestern side, to the Cape Breton Highlands. The Denys, Middle, Baddeck, and Georges Rivers all empty into the lake. The lake water has lower salinity than the surrounding ocean, and varies from about 20 parts per thousand near river mouths to 29 parts per thousand in deeper areas. Ice cover has been declining in recent years. The lake is connected to the North Atlantic by two natural channels; the Great and Little Bras d'Or Channels which pass on either side of Boularderie Island. The southern tip of the lake is connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Peters Canal, built for shipping traffic in the 1860s. The restricted channels to the ocean cause a reduction in tidal range. Seaweed populations resemble those found in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The warm waters are suitable for eastern oyster. Fish species include the blackspotted stickleback, white hake, blueback herring, Greenland cod, and introduced  rainbow trout. These feed double-crested cormorants, bald eagles, and great blue herons."

The town was renamed for the mills. The building was saved from demolition in the 1930s and purchased and run by a group including playwrights Moss Hart and Kenyon Nicholson. Renovations converting the building into a theatre began in 1938. The first show opened there on 1 July 1939, Springtime for Henry featuring Edward Everett Horton. The Bucks County Playhouse became a summer theater. It was the starting point for many actors and became a place where plays slated for Broadway were tried out. Neil Simon's Barefoot in the Park had its premiere at the theater in 1963, starring Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley.  Other notable actors who performed at the theater over the years include Bela Lugosi, Dick Van Dyke, Tyne Daly, Grace Kelly, Angela Lansbury, and Walter Matthau. The Bucks County Playhouse Conservancy, a public/private partnership, raised sufficient funds to regain the property following a 2010 foreclosure.  Following an extensive renovation, the theater reopened on July 2, 2012."

        "content": "Crafers was named after David Crafer, who arrived in Adelaide in 1838 and moved to the area. With his wife he established an inn, the Sawyers Arms, in 1839 three years after the colony of South Australia was created. He then built the Norfolk Arms on  in 1840 with banquet seating for 150. He moved to Adelaide and sold the Norfolk Arms in 1842, at which point it was known as The Crafers Inn. A new hotel was built on the site in 1880, remaining into the 21st century as The Crafers Inn, but the original building was burned down in 1926. At the time the area at the foot of nearby Mount Lofty was known as the Tiers, infamous for being the haunt of numerous Tiersmen and woodcutters on the run from authorities in Adelaide. The historic Crafers Primary School was first established in the area in 1865 by Mr Edward Smith. The school was initially located in small premises in Atkinson Road, and then moved to its present location in Piccadilly Road in 1928. The historic stone and brick building was opened on 31 August of that year. The late 1970s saw extensive upgrading of the school facilities under Principal Allan Stanley-Smith, including construction of the Ruth Beare Hall in 1976 named after Ruth Beare who taught at the school from 1937 to 1944 and 1947 to 1975. The Church of the Epiphany, Epiphany Place, Crafers has played a prominent role in the life of the district since it was built in 1878 on land donated by Henry Scott. For many years Crafers was well known for being the start point of the South Eastern Freeway linking Adelaide with the town of Murray Bridge, and to the Princes Highway leading to Melbourne. It wasn't until 2000 that the Heysen Tunnels project was completed to extend the freeway to Glen Osmond on the outskirts of Adelaide. Prior to the tunnel opening, the winding road from Adelaide to Glen Osmond via Eagle On The Hill was frequently the scene of horrific vehicle accidents, often involving semi-trailers. The Mount Lofty Botanic Garden is nestled in the hills behind Crafers. The gardens, opened in 1977, include an extensive mix of European and Australian native plants and are at their finest in the spring months. On 16 February 1983, Crafers was hard hit by the Ash Wednesday bushfires. Many homes adjacent to bushland on the western side of the suburb were destroyed (as well as the Anglican theological college and priory of St Michael's House) as the fire came roaring out of the then Cleland National Park, and the devastation would have been much worse if a change in weather had not occurred right when the township of Crafers itself was being threatened. A memorial on Mount Lofty Summit is dedicated to those in the Adelaide Hills who lost their lives that day. Crafers is under the administration of the Adelaide Hills Council, and is in the state electoral district of Bragg and the federal electorate of Mayo. Crafers West is in the state electoral district of Heysen."

The city is the capital of the district of Gotha and was also a residence of the Ernestine Wettins from 1640 until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha originating here spawned many European rulers, including the royal houses of the United Kingdom, Belgium, Portugal (until 1910) and Bulgaria (until 1946). In the Middle Ages, Gotha was a rich trading town on the trade route Via Regia and between 1650 and 1850, Gotha saw a cultural heyday as a centre of sciences and arts, fostered by the dukes of Saxe-Gotha. The first duke, Ernest the Pious, was famous for his wise rule. In the 18th century, the Almanach de Gotha was first published in the city. The cartographer Justus Perthes and the encyclopedist Joseph Meyer made Gotha a leading centre of German publishing around 1800. In the early 19th century, Gotha was a birthplace of the German insurance business. The SPD was founded in Gotha in 1875 by merging two predecessors. In that period Gotha became an industrial centre, with companies such as the Gothaer Waggonfabrik, a producer of trams and later aeroplanes. The main sights of Gotha are the early-modern Friedenstein Castle, one of the largest Renaissance Baroque castles in Germany, the medieval city centre and the Gr\u00fcnderzeit buildings of 19th-century commercial boom. Gotha lies in the southern part of the Thuringian Basin in a flat and agricultural landscape."

        "content": "Gotha has existed at least since the 8th century, when it was mentioned in a document signed by Charlemagne as Villa Gotaha (Old High German gotaha meaning \"good waters\") in 775. The first settlement was probably located around today's Hersdorfplatz outside the north-eastern edge of the later city centre. During the 11th century, the nearby Ludowingians received the village and established the city in the late 12th century, as Gotha became their second most important city after Eisenach. The city generated wealth because it was conveniently located at the junction of two important long-distance trade routes: the Via Regia from Mainz and Frankfurt to Leipzig and Breslau and a north\u2013south route from M\u00fchlhausen over the Thuringian Forest to Franconia. One of the oldest pieces of evidence of busy trade in the city is the \"Gotha cache of coins\" with nearly 800 Bracteates, buried in 1185 in the central city. In 1180, Gotha was first mentioned as a city, when the area between Br\u00fchl and J\u00fcdenstra\u00dfe became the core of urban development, highlighting the early presence of Jews in this old trading town. The parish church of this first urban settlement was St. Mary's Church (demolished in 1530) at Schlossberg. The castle (at the site occupied today by Friedenstein Castle) was first mentioned in 1217. As the Ludowingians died out in 1247, Gotha became part of the Wettins' territories, where it remained until 1918. The new town east of Querstra\u00dfe was established in the early 15th century (with the Neumarkt, first mentioned in 1428). The monastery (first Cistercians, since 1258 Augustinians) was founded before 1251 and abandoned in 1525. Until 1665, the bourse of Gotha was located in the centre of Hauptmarkt square inside the Renaissance building, which hosts the town hall today. The medieval town hall was located on the north-eastern edge of Hauptmarkt, at the site of today's Innungshalle. Water supply was a big problem, because Gotha is not located on a river. In 1369, Landgrave Balthasar had the Leinakanal built. This channel, over 25 kilometres long, brought fresh water from the Thuringian Forest (H\u00f6rsel and Apfelst\u00e4dt rivers) to the city. The main businesses of medieval Gotha were cloth-making and the woad trade."

        "content": "The Reformation was introduced in Gotha in 1524 and the castle was rebuilt as a larger fortress between 1530 and 1541. Gotha was already part of the Ernestine Wettins territory after the 1485 Treaty of Leipzig. However, the Ernestines' loss of power after the Schmalkaldic War in 1547, the Treaty of Erfurt in 1572, when the city became part of Saxe-Coburg, and the Thirty Years' War resulted in Gotha's decline. The local castle, Grimmenstein, was razed by Imperial troops in 1572. The turnaround was brought about by the selection of Gotha as a ducal residence in the 1640 territorial partition, when Ernest the Pious founded the duchy of Saxe-Gotha. The strongly Protestant and absolutist sovereign quickly began to reorganize his small state (even before the war had ended) and in particular fostered the school system, for example by introducing compulsory education up to the age of 12 in 1642. This was the origin of the often noted liberal education of the Gotha citizenry and the following cultural heyday. Veit Ludwig von Seckendorff was one of numerous experienced and loyal civil servants employed by the duke. Seckendorff was considered one of the most able and influential thinkers on administration and public law of his time. His book Der teutsche F\u00fcrstenstaat (1656), written by order of Ernest, served for decades as a standard work in teaching political science at Protestant universities in Germany. Friedenstein Castle was built between 1643 and 1654 and is one of the first large Baroque residence castles in Germany. Between 1657 and 1676, the city received a stronger fortification, which was demolished between 1772 and 1811. In their place, a park around Friedenstein and a boulevard around the city were established. Some important scientific institutions were the ducal library (today's Forschungsbibliothek Gotha as part of the University of Erfurt), founded in 1650, the \"coin cabinet\" (1712), the \"art and natural collection\", basis of today's museums, and the Gotha Observatory at Seeberg mountain, established 1788. The Gotha porcelain manufactory (established in 1767) was famous around 1800 for their faiences. In 1774, the actor group led by Conrad (or Konrad) Ekhof, called \"the father of German acting\", came from Weimar to Gotha. He began working at the Schlosstheater and became Direktor of the first ever German court theatre (founded in 1683), while acting in many plays himself. Having turned it into one of the leading theatres in Germany, after his death in 1778 the fame of the theatre declined rapidly. The Almanach de Gotha, a directory of European royalty and nobility, was first published in 1763 and Justus Perthes founded his science publishing company in 1785. Joseph Meyer followed in 1826 by founding the Bibliographisches Institut, one of the two leading encyclopedia publishers in the German language besides the Brockhaus and Adolf Stieler first published his Handatlas in Gotha in 1816. Johann Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the order of the Illuminati, died in Gotha in 1830. It was also during this time, that the city developed a sizeable Jewish population."

        "content": "From 1826 to 1918, Gotha along with Coburg was one of the two capitals of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Under the rule of Duke Ernest II, Gotha was a centre of Germany's liberal movement, where the Gothaer Nachparlament, an aftermath of 1848 German Revolution took place. After 1851, Gustav Freytag, novelist, advocate of German unity and often a harsh critic of Otto von Bismarck made Siebleben (today part of Gotha) his summer home. Ernest II made Freytag Hofrat (privy councillor) in 1854, when the Prussian government had issued a warrant for his arrest. In 1875, the German socialist party (SPD) was founded in Gotha through the merger of two organizations: the Social Democratic Workers' Party, led by August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, and the General German Workers' Association, founded by Ferdinand Lassalle. A compromise known as the Gotha Program was forged, although it was strongly criticized by Karl Marx for its reformist bias in his Critique of the Gotha Program. From 1876 to 1908, the novelist Kurd Lasswitz, sometimes referred to as \"the father of German science fiction\" worked as a teacher at Gotha's Ernestinum, the oldest Gymnasium in Thuringia. Industrialization started in Gotha around 1850, as the city was connected to the Thuringian Railway in 1847. The city became a centre of engineering with companies like the Gothaer Waggonfabrik, a tram and airplane manufacturer, founded in 1883. During the 19th century, Gotha also became a centre of banking and the insurance business in Germany. Ernst-Wilhelm Arnoldi founded the first fire insurance in 1820, followed by the first life insurance in 1827. The  mutual insurance remains one of the largest insurance companies in Germany (it moved to Cologne after World War II). Gotha's tram network was established in 1894. The first crematory in Germany was built in Gotha in 1878. The Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), a left-wing breakaway of the SPD was founded in Gotha in 1917 in opposition to the SPD's war policies during World War I. During the German Revolution, the Duke abdicated in 1918. A far-left government was elected in Gotha in 1919 and worked against both the Weimar National Assembly and the Kapp-L\u00fcttwitz Putsch in 1920 bringing the city to the edge of a civil war. After a referendum, the state of Gotha joined the newly created Freistaat Thuringia in 1920. Under Nazi rule, Gotha became a centre of the arms industry with nearly 7,000 forced labourers working in the city's factories, where more than 200 died. The Gotha barracks in the southern periphery were enlarged and during the Kristallnacht in 1938 the synagogue was destroyed. Allied air raids in 1944/5 damaged some buildings in the city, in particular the state theatre (demolished by East German authorities in 1958) and the main station (which remains only \"half-a-building\" until today) and the main church (rebuilt after the war). Nevertheless, some 95% of the city's buildings survived the war unscathed. Jewish slave laborers working in quarries at Gotha were all murdered by their Nazi overseers on 4 April 1945, just before the city was captured by American forces. The American Army reached the city in April 1945 but was replaced by the Soviets in July 1945 and in 1949 Gotha became part of the GDR. During this period, some historic inner-city quarters were replaced by Plattenbau buildings, especially west of the Hauptmarkt and at Gartenstra\u00dfe north of the city centre. Many other buildings fell derelict during the later GDR period and the city's time of shrinking in the 1990s, whereas others were refurbished after German reunification in 1990. Gotha's economy was hit by the transition from state to market economy after 1990, nevertheless, some companies survived or were newly founded and have made Gotha an economically relatively successful city."

        "content": "Gotha is situated in a flat landscape within the fertile Thuringian Basin. A tectonic dislocation traverses the city from north-west to south-east. Thereby, it forms three prominent hills: the 431 m high Krahnberg with the Ratsholz forest in the north-west, the hill of Friedenstein Castle in the city centre and the 409 m high Seeberg in the south-east. The city itself lies at an elevation of 300 m and the municipal territory is nearly free of forest (with the two named mountains as exceptions) and is in intensive agricultural use. As one out of only very few ancient cities in Germany, Gotha is not situated on a river, so that water supply was already a problem in the Middle Ages. For that reason, the Leinakanal was built in the 14th century over a distance of more than 25 kilometres, which was at the time an enormous task. The Leinakanal brings water from H\u00f6rsel and Apfelst\u00e4dt river to Gotha, overcoming the watershed between Elbe (Apfelst\u00e4dt) and Weser (Gotha). The drain of Leinakanal is the Flutgraben, a tributary of Nesse. The Thuringian Forest is located  south-west of Gotha."

        "content": "Gotha has long been one of the largest towns in Thuringia. During the Middle Ages, it was a town of 5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants and its selection as a ducal residence brought another impetus during the 17th and 18th century, so that Gotha had already more than 10,000 inhabitants by 1800. The number rose to 15,000 around 1850, as industrialisation started and the city was connected to the railway. The population saw a steady growth to 23,000 in 1875, 35,000 in 1900, 46,000 in 1925 and 58,000 in 1950, when the peak was reached. Until 1990, the population was roughly constant at around 57,000. After German reunification in 1990, the city saw a significant decline in population, it shrank to 48,000 by 2000 and to 44,000 by 2012. Between 2013 and 2016, the population rose in each consecutive year. In 2016 it reached 45,640. The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was -0.05% p.a, whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Gotha. It occurred after reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas are situated within the administrative city borders. During the 1990s and the early 2000s, many inhabitants left Gotha to search for a better life in west Germany or other major east German cities like Jena or Erfurt. Since 2005, emigration is not a big issue anymore. Today, the birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because immigration is not sufficient to compensate for it in recent years. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy was a problem with rates around 9% in 2011 but declined to 4% in 2017. A side effect of the high vacancy rate is Gotha's low rent level. The birth deficit was 175 in 2012, this is -3.9 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was +6.2 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6). The most important regions of origin of Gotha migrants are bordering rural areas of Thuringia as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria. Like other eastern German cities, foreigners account for only a small share of Gotha's population: circa 2.5% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 7.1% are classified as migrants (according to the 2011 EU census). In contrast to the national average, the largest groups of migrants in Gotha are Russians, Vietnamese and Ukrainians. Due to the official atheism of the former GDR, most of the population is non-religious. 18.2% are members of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and 4.8% are Catholics (according to the 2011 EU census)."

Both were walled until 1810, when the city walls were broken down and a boulevard was laid out in their place. Early-modern suburbiums were established to the south-west (around Dreikronengasse), to the west (around Gro\u00dfe Fahnenstra\u00dfe) and to the east (around Mohrenberg). The later 19th century brought larger growth in all directions. Especially the axis between the main station and the city centre received a representative development in capital-city style. Due to Gotha's function as a ducal residence, most buildings built between 1870 and 1914 were generous in size and many mansions were built. Only some outer districts show the typical German working-class tenements (e.g. around Oststra\u00dfe and Seebergstra\u00dfe). The largest Plattenbau settlement of Gotha was established at the western periphery during the late GDR period. In the 1980s, large areas of the western old town were demolished and replaced by small-scale Plattenbau houses. After 1990, many buildings were thoroughly refurbished after having fallen into dereliction during GDR times. Nevertheless, a relatively large share of ruined historic buildings remains characteristic for Gotha (in comparison to neighbouring cities like Eisenach, Erfurt or Weimar), especially within the historic new town and the 19th century belt around the city centre. The government sometimes failed to conserve historic buildings, for example the  was demolished in 2007, as was the  in 2011 (although the latter has now being reconstructed externally).

        "content": "Fleetwood is a coastal town in the Borough of Wyre in Lancashire, England, at the northwest corner of the Fylde. It had a population of 25,939 at the 2011 census. Fleetwood acquired its modern character in the 1830s, when the principal landowner Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood, High Sheriff and MP, conceived an ambitious plan to re-develop the town to make it a busy seaport and railway spur. He commissioned the distinguished Victorian architect Decimus Burton to design a number of substantial civic buildings, including two lighthouses. Hesketh-Fleetwood's transport terminus schemes failed to materialise. The town expanded greatly in the first half of the 20th century with the growth of the fishing industry, and passenger ferries to the Isle of Man, to become a deep-sea fishing port. Decline of the fishing industry began in the 1960s, hastened by the Cod Wars with Iceland, though fish processing is still a major economic activity in Fleetwood. The town's most notable employer today is Lofthouse of Fleetwood, manufacturer of the lozenge Fisherman's Friend which is exported around the world."

        "content": "Ptolemy's Geographia in the 2nd century AD records a tribe known as the Setantii living in what is believed to be present-day West Lancashire, and a seaport built by the Romans called PORTVS SETANTIORVM ('the port of the Setantii') abutting Moricambe Aestuarium (presumably Morecambe Bay). There is also evidence of a Roman road running from Ribchester to Kirkham ( southeast of Fleetwood) which then makes a sharp turn to the northwest. Together, these suggest that Fleetwood may well have been the location of this Roman port. No direct evidence of the port has been found, but in 2007, an Iron Age settlement was discovered at Bourne Hill, just south of present-day Fleetwood, suggesting the area was populated in pre-Roman times. There is evidence that the eastern side of the River Wyre was occupied during the Danish invasions of the 9th and 10th centuries. By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, the land on which Fleetwood now stands was part of the Hundred of Amounderness. A manor house at present-day Rossall, in the southwest of the town, was in the possession of the Allen family by the time of Henry VIII. The Allens were prominent Roman Catholics, and Henry VIII repossessed the land. Cardinal William Allen was born at the manor house in 1532. It was ultimately sold to Thomas Fleetwood, comptroller of the Royal Mint, whose son Edmund, expanded the house into Rossall Hall. The land remained in the Fleetwood family for 300 years."

        "content": "By the 1830s, the house and estate was in the ownership of Edmund's descendant Peter Hesketh, High Sheriff of Lancashire and MP for Preston. A man of somewhat liberal views for his time, Hesketh believed that the sheltered harbour and views over Morecambe Bay gave the area the makings of a busy seaport and popular resort for the less-affluent. With no rail link between London and Scotland, he envisaged Fleetwood as the transfer point between the railway and the steamers to Scotland, and set about encouraging a railway link from Preston. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he engaged Frederick Kemp as his agent. He originally considered naming the new town Wyreton or New Liverpool, but after changing his name to Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831, he settled on the name Fleetwood. After some delays, he recruited the prominent architect Decimus Burton, whose work in St Leonard's-on-Sea he had admired, to lay out what would be the first planned town of the Victorian era. The plans were complete by 1835, and construction of the first buildings and the railway line began in 1836. Burton's plan was to use the largest of the sand-dunes on the north-facing shore as the focus of a half-wheel street layout. This was landscaped, and became known as the Mount. It served as the hub of Burton's half-wheel design, the main residential streets acted as the spokes, and the main commerce area of Dock Street was the rim of the wheel. The oldest surviving building in the town, once the custom house, later the town hall and latterly Fleetwood Museum, dates from 1836 and housing from as early as 1838 still exists in the town. The crown jewel was the North Euston Hotel, built in 1841, a fine semi-circular building overlooking the bay and the river's estuary. The hotel was built to serve overnight guests making the railway journey from Euston, and was close to the point of departure for the steamers to Scotland. This journey was made by Queen Victoria in 1847, but by the mid-1850s the completion of the western railway link between London and Scotland over Shap Fell rendered Fleetwood's role as a transport terminus obsolete. Burton designed two lighthouses for the town: The Upper Lighthouse, usually referred to as the Pharos (after the Pharos of Alexandria in Egypt, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World), can be seen for  and Beach Lighthouse is visible for . Both opened in 1840. A third lighthouse, Wyre Light, built in 1839\u201340 by blind engineer Alexander Mitchell, offshore on the northeast corner of North Wharf, was the first screw pile lighthouse to be built in Great Britain. Fleetwood is the only town in the United Kingdom to possess three lighthouses and the two within the town itself remain fully operational. Wyre Light has now fallen into a state of disrepair. Fleetwood Market, still a prominent permanent market, first opened in 1840. By 1838, Hesketh-Fleetwood had run into serious financial difficulties, with costs for the railway in particular ultimately exceeding \u00a3300,000. He had numerous financial arguments with Frederick Kemp, who borrowed against the estate revenues to finance the expansion of the town, and was suspected of taking financial advantage of Sir Peter. Hesketh-Fleetwood became short of cash and was forced to mortgage his properties. Depressed, he gradually withdrew from the project, and by 1844 he had been obliged to sell much of his estate. He leased Rossall Hall itself to the Church of England, which intended to set up a boarding school as a North of England equivalent of Marlborough School. Under the auspices of Rev. St. Vincent Beechey, the vicar of Fleetwood, it was to become Rossall School. Virtually bankrupt, Hesketh-Fleetwood retired to Brighton, giving up his parliamentary obligations in 1847. Meanwhile, Kemp's influence expanded. He had set up the Fleetwood Estates Company to manage the land, and the North Lancashire Steam Navigation Company in 1843 to manage the expanding steamer trade. However, by the late 1850s, the combination of the new western railway route and the rise of neighbouring Blackpool as a prominent seaside resort signalled a decline in the town's fortunes. From the 1860s Fleetwood expanded its port activities. Steamers began pleasure and commercial services to the Isle of Man, Ardrossan and Belfast.  of stone quays were built along the river front, and the railway line was extended to the steamer pier opposite Queen's Terrace, where the imposing new railway station was built in 1883. The port was still mainly a cargo terminal at this time, but the fishing industry began to grow as vessels expanded their catchment area from the Irish Sea fishing grounds first fished in the 1840s, to the haddock grounds of the North Atlantic Ocean. At this time, all the fishing vessels out of Fleetwood were sail-powered fishing smacks, few being over 40 tons deadweight. The Fleetwood Docks Act of 1864 enabled the construction of a dock and embankment for both fishing and general cargo. Work on what was to become Wyre Dock began in 1869 but was suspended for financial reasons. A second Act in 1871 gave construction authority to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, under chief engineers Sir John Hawkshaw and Harrison Hayter. Construction itself, by John Aird & Sons, was completed in 1877. Heavy industry came to the area in the late 1880s with the construction of a salt-processing works on the southeastern edge of the town by the Fleetwood Salt Co. Ltd, using salt mined in Preesall, across the river. By the early 1890s, the construction and expansion of rival cargo ports in the North West and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal heralded the decline of Fleetwood's prominence as a cargo port. However, at the same time this was more than offset by a period of rapid expansion of the fishing industry, signalled by the launch in 1891 of the first steam powered trawler, the Lark. All the other major fishing ports in Britain, Hull, Grimsby and Aberdeen, were on the east coast, so there was a competitive advantage for a west-coast port with good rail links. By the start of the 20th century, Fleetwood's position as one of the three major fishing ports in England was cemented. James Marr brought a fleet of steam trawlers to Fleetwood and actively started to change the port by selectively fishing for hake, which until then had been treated as a much less desirable catch. Many of the houses in the old area of town around the Mount and Lord Street were built in the 1890s. In keeping with the thriving economy, these terraced houses were large for their era. An electric tramway link to Blackpool was constructed in the 1890s and remains operational to this day. The trams were routed along East Street and West Street (now Lord Street and North Albert Street) rather than Dock Street, and commercial trade followed, making those streets the commercial centre of the town. Fleetwood is the only town in Britain with trams running the full length of its main street, sharing road-space with cars. The docks were expanded in 1908 with the construction of the Fish Dock, accessible through Wyre Dock and still used today for the inshore fleet. Plans for a pier were first made in the 1890s but building did not start until 1909 and it was opened in 1910. It was the last new seaside pier to be built in the United Kingdom."

        "content": "By the 1920s, the fishing industry was at its height, employing over 9,000 people. Over the next few years, the sea front along the north shore was developed in resort fashion, to encourage visitors for whom the brashness of Blackpool was too daunting. The Marine Hall entertainment complex (1935), golf course (1931) and Model Yacht Pond (1932) all date from this era. In the 1920s, the salt works, by now owned by the United Alkali Company (after 1926 part of ICI), was considerably expanded, and became an ammonia-processing plant. ICI built an adjacent chemical processing plant, known as ICI Hillhouse. ICI would become the town's third-largest employer, after the fishing and tourism industries. The first fully automated telephone exchange in Britain was put into operation to serve the town on 15 July 1922. The town was hit by a huge flood in October 1927, which put 90% of the area of the town under water. Only the higher lying areas around the Mount escaped. Additional housing was built in the 1920s and 1930s in the less developed central areas of the town, and a further development boom occurred in the 1960s in the lower lying western portion of the town (Larkholme). Many industries related to fishing grew up along the rail corridor on the eastern side of the town, and a number of unrelated industries also moved to the area to take advantage of the availability of labour. By the 1960s, however, Fleetwood began to decline economically. The last ferry to the Isle of Man sailed in 1961. The sailings have been revived periodically since. The main railway station was closed in 1966 as a result of the Beeching cuts, and the passenger terminus was moved to Wyre Dock railway station. This in turn was closed in 1970, as the branch line from Poulton was taken out of service. Additional light industry developed along the former railway bed. The rise of package holidays abroad led to fewer visitors generally to British resort towns. As Blackpool expanded its attractions, fewer day visitors came to Fleetwood, and as transport became more efficient, more overnight visitors became day visitors. The Hillhouse plant was heavily cut back, and was finally closed in 1999. Most serious, however, was the collapse of the fishing industry, which was largely destroyed in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the Cod Wars, a dispute over fishing rights between Iceland and the UK. As Fleetwood's trawlers mainly fished the North Atlantic in search of cod, the loss of the fishing grounds hit the town hard. The last deep sea trawler left the town in 1982 and now only inshore fishing boats fish out of the port, although trawlers registered in other places can still be seen taking advantage of the fish market. Fish is still a big industry in the town, though the jobs are mainly in processing rather than fishing. A pair of bronze figures on the promenade by the pier depicts the idea of families welcoming back the fishermen from sea. In 1973, the area around the old railway station was developed into a container port facility, with P & O operating a container service to Larne in Northern Ireland. In 1975, this became a Roll-on/roll-off service. This development led indirectly to some renewal of the then largely derelict Dock Street area, and improved road access to the town to support the container traffic. Twice-daily container service continued until 2004 when Stena Line bought the route and increased the service to three times a day. In December 2010, Stena Line announced that the service would be withdrawn at the end of 2010, with the loss of 140 jobs. Since the 1970s there have been several attempts to enhance Fleetwood's economic profile, In 1995, the now-deserted Wyre Dock was developed into a marina. The derelict dock landing area was developed into Freeport, a retail centre, and housing has been built at the north end of the marina. Most recently, in July 2007, a new \"Masterplan\" for revitalising the waterfront and town centre was submitted to the Wyre Borough Council. In 1996 Fleetwood could be seen in \"A High Profile\", an episode of Hetty Wainthropp Investigates. Several buildings along The Esplanade were used, one of Fleetwood's churches and others."

The administrative headquarters is in Poulton-le-Fylde. The borough is a constituent part of Lancashire County Council. Although Wyre Council has an overwhelming Conservative majority (thirty seven out of a total of fifty councillors), eight of Fleetwood's councillors belong to Labour four to UKIP and one Independent . Prior to 1974, Fleetwood had been a municipal borough since 1933, and from 1894 to 1933, an urban district. The town is divided into five wards, Mount, Pharos, Warren, Park and Rossall. A Fleetwood parish council (known as Fleetwood Town Council) was established following a referendum in June 2009. The boundaries of the parish are coterminous with the boundary of the five borough council wards of Fleetwood and the town council has thirteen councillors. In the 2010 General Election, Fleetwood was joined with Lancaster and some Over Wyre locations to form the new Lancaster and Fleetwood constituency. Conservative member Eric Ollerenshaw was elected in a tight race. From 1997 to 2010, Fleetwood was included with Thornton and parts of Blackpool, as part of the Blackpool North and Fleetwood parliamentary constituency. During that time the seat was held by Labour's Joan Humble. Prior to 1997, Fleetwood was part of the constituencies of Fylde North and Wyre, whose boundaries more closely matched those of Wyre Borough, and which consistently returned a Conservative member. In the 2015 general election a majority vote saw Fleetwood become a Labour town once again, represented by Cat Smith."

The town itself is on a peninsula, almost  wide, bounded to the west by the Irish Sea, to the north by Morecambe Bay and to the east by the River Wyre. Access to Fleetwood is thus restricted, and for many years there were only two roads into and out of the town. A large sandbank, the North Wharf, extends some  north into Morecambe Bay, and is exposed at low tide. The river channel forms the eastern boundary of the bank. Together with the larger Bernard Wharf on the other side of the river, this makes navigation of the river difficult. Conversely, the port is highly sheltered from the prevailing westerly winds. Like the remainder of the Fylde, the land is extremely flat, the highest point being the Mount, the large sand dune in the northern part of the town, from which the original street plan radiated. Parts of Fleetwood, especially to the north and west, are barely above sea level at high tide, and a large retaining sea wall runs along much of the western edge of the town. Nevertheless, Fleetwood was flooded in 1927 and again in 1977. The latter flood, although much smaller, affected more properties as there had been considerable development in the 1960s in the lower-lying parts of the town. The soil is broadly sandy, but there is considerable marshland to the south and east, by the river. The town itself encompasses an area of just under ."

It is surmounted by a pavilion built in 1902 incorporating a clock added in 1919. The wall on the inland side of the Mount is built from pebbles, in traditional Fylde style. The Mount and the entire length of Fleetwood Promenade has an uninterrupted view across Morecambe Bay, a view described by author Bill Bryson in Chapter 23 of his book Notes From a Small Island as \"easily one of the most beautiful in the world, with unforgettable views across to the green and blue Lakeland hills: Scafell, Coniston Old Man, the Langdale Pikes.\" Directly across the Esplanade from the Mount lies the Marine Hall and Marine Gardens, Wyre Borough's largest entertainment venue, opened in 1935. The 13 hectares of Fleetwood Memorial Park was developed out of the earlier Warrenhurst Park, itself an early-C20 park designed by Thomas Lumb of Blackpool. In 1917 the park was renamed \"Memorial Park\" in memory of those who died in the First World War. The memorial statue was added a few years later and memorial trees planted by the children who lost relatives. In the early 1900s the park was home to a boating lake and the current facilities include three crown green bowling greens, a children's play area and picnic area, cenotaph memorial, duck pond, football pitches (on the site of the old boating lake) and tennis courts. Fleetwood Pier, also known as 'Victoria Pier', was a feature of the town from its construction in 1910 until it was destroyed by fire in September 2008. Built at the end of the 'golden age' of pier building, it was the last pleasure pier to be built in the United Kingdom, other than a 1957 pier built in Deal, Kent, to replace a structure damaged in the Second World War. At  in length, it was one of the shortest piers in the country. At various times, it was an amusement complex, bar and dance hall. In 1952 the pier was badly damaged in a fire which started in the cinema, and it did not reopen until 1958. The pier was closed again in 2006, and plans were drawn up to convert the structure into a flats complex. However, the pier was again heavily damaged by fire in the early hours of 9 September 2008. On 26 September 2008, Wyre Borough Council announced that the pier would be completely demolished, and two weeks later confirmed that the pier would not be rebuilt. The pier site remains undeveloped many years later, as plans for flats or apartments have come to nothing. The site remains an eyesore and remains fenced off, many years after the fire. Fleetwood has two prominent retail locations. Freeport Fleetwood, opened in 1995, is a waterfront outlet shopping village, on the site of the former Wyre Dock, with 45 shops in a marina setting. Freeport was re-branded and re-launched in 2006 at a cost of \u00a38.6m. Fleetwood Market on Victoria Street is one of the largest covered markets in the North West, with over 250 stalls. It was first opened in 1840, although the present stone building dates from 1892."

It formerly had a spire, but this was demolished in 1904. St Mary's, the town's main Roman Catholic church, stands nearby. Built in 1867, it was designed by E. W. Pugin. A more modern church of interest is the copper-roofed St Nicholas, on Poulton Road, designed by Laurence King and completed in 1962."

Ships sailing down the Wyre channel line up the two lights, one above the other, to guide them. The Pharos is the only functioning lighthouse in the United Kingdom built in the middle of the street. It now forms a traffic roundabout. The North Euston Hotel, opened in 1841, is still the largest hotel in Fleetwood. Queen's Terrace was completed in 1844 and is regarded as an outstanding example of classical architecture. Now mostly used for offices and private flats, at various times it has been used as a school, hospital, railway offices and wartime consulates for European nations. The town contains a total of forty-four buildings listed in the National Heritage List for England, all at Grade\u00a0II."

        "content": "Fleetwood has had several football clubs over its history. The current version of the club, dating from 1997, is now known as Fleetwood Town F.C. and is nicknamed the Fishermen, and its followers the Cod Army. The club has played in the Football League since 2012, having been promoted in that year as champions of the Conference National. This is the first time a club from the town has played in the Football League. In May 2014 Fleetwood were victorious in the League 2 play-off final to win promotion to League 1. In August 2014, Nathan Pond, played in his seventh different division for the club, an achievement officially recognised by Guinness as a world record under the title of 'the most football (soccer) divisions played in for one club by an individual.' . With a population of under 26,000, Fleetwood was the smallest town in England with a League club until the promotion of Forest Green Rovers from Nailsworth in 2017. A previous incarnation of Fleetwood Town F.C. enjoyed a brief history from 1977, reaching the final of the FA Vase in 1985, before being wound up because of financial difficulties in 1996. The same fate also befell the two previous town clubs. Fleetwood F.C. was founded in 1908 and wound up in 1976, having been several times Lancashire Combination cup champions in the 1930s, and founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968. Fleetwood Rangers, the town's first club, spent ten seasons in the Lancashire League and Lancashire Combination from 1889 to 1899. Since 1939, home games have been played at Highbury Stadium. Blackpool Reserves also use the stadium for their home matches. In January 1938, Jimmy Hampson, who remains Blackpool's record goalscorer, drowned off the Fleetwood coast during a fishing trip. The yacht on which he was sailing collided with a trawler and Hampson, 31, was knocked overboard. He drowned, and his body was never recovered. Speedway racing was staged at Highbury Stadium from 1948 to 1952, with Fleetwood Flyers riding in the Second Division of the National Speedway league. The Flyers started the 1948 season as Wigan RLFC but moved to Fleetwood after racing a few away fixtures billed as Wigan. The Flyers raced in the National League Division Two from 1948 to 1951 without enjoying any great success. In 1952 the venue staged a number of open events with the team renamed the Fleetwood Knights. Fleetwood Rugby Union Football Club is an amateur rugby union club, first registered in 1932 as Fleetwood Old Boys, with the Old Boys title being dropped in the 1950s. Fleetwood Cricket Club, based at Broadwater, are affiliated with the Lancashire Cricket Board and compete in the Northern League. From the 1930s to the present, the Model Yacht Pond, one of Europe's largest, has been host to numerous national and international championships, held under the aegis of the Fleetwood Model Yacht and Power Boat Club. Fleetwood Reservoir on Copse Road provides coarse fishing facilities. The fishing club is affiliated to the National Federation of Anglers. Matches take place every Sunday and Friday during the summer months. Fleetwood is a popular location for kitesurfing and other power kite sports. There are several suitable beaches and training is available at the local kite school."

It is about  from Fleetwood to the southern terminus at Starr Gate, and about  to Talbot Square, Blackpool. There are 10 tram stops in the town, the southernmost being Rossall School. Trams run the full length of both Lord Street and North Albert Street, undivided from regular road traffic. Bus service to Blackpool is provided by Blackpool Transport and Stagecoach North West, who also provide services to Preston and other local destinations. There are frequent passenger ferry sailings from Fleetwood across the River Wyre to Knott End-on-Sea. Passenger sailings to Douglas are not currently on a regular timetable. Ferries were operated by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company from 1876 to 1961, and again periodically from 1971. However, in recent years the service has been restricted to once or twice per year. From 2004, Stena Line provided some passenger accommodation on its thrice daily service to Larne in Northern Ireland. However, Stena Line withdrew the service at the end of 2010. The town being built on a peninsula, for many years there were only two roads into and out of Fleetwood: Broadway, through Cleveleys, designated as the A587, and Fleetwood Road, through Thornton, designated as the A585. To cater for container traffic, Amounderness Way was built in the late 1970s and re-designated as the A585. In the 1990s, Amounderness Way was extended further into the town to the end of Dock Street (the entrance to the Freeport shopping village) along the former railway bed. The town was for several years the northern Fylde terminus of the railway line to London, hence the hotel opposite the site of the now demolished Fleetwood railway station is called the North Euston Hotel. The line also carried landed fish from the docks to distant markets. There has been no railway service to Fleetwood since 1970. Poulton-le-Fylde and Blackpool North are the nearest railway stations. However, the line to Poulton is still present, and plans remain to re-open the line in the future. In June 2021 a feasibility study was submitted by the Lancashire County Council to the Department for Transport to re-open the line from Fleetwood to Poulton-le-Fylde, under the government's Restoring Your Railway programme."

It holds collections established during the mid-19th century. The Museum's collection was amassed substantially by major American art and sculpture collectors, a father and son: William Thompson Walters, (1819\u20131894), who began collecting when he moved to Paris as a nominal Southern/Confederate sympathizer at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861; and Henry Walters (1848\u20131931), who refined the collection and made arrangements for the construction of a later landmark building to rehouse it. After allowing the Baltimore public to occasionally view his father's and his growing added collections at his West Mount Vernon Place townhouse/mansion during the late 1800s, he arranged for an elaborate stone palazzo-styled structure built for that purpose in 1905\u20131909. Located across the back alley, a block south of the Walters mansion on West Monument Street/Mount Vernon Place, on the northwest corner of North Charles Street at West Centre Street. The mansion and gallery were also just south and west of the landmark Washington Monument in the  Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, just north of the downtown business district and northeast of Cathedral Hill. Upon his 1931 death, Henry Walters bequeathed the entire collection of then more than 22,000 works, the original Charles Street Gallery building, and his adjacent townhouse/mansion just across the alley to the north on West Mount Vernon Place to the City of Baltimore, \"for the benefit of the public.\" The collection includes masterworks of ancient Egypt, Greek sculpture and Roman sarcophagi, medieval ivories, illuminated manuscripts, Renaissance bronzes, Old Master European and 19th-century paintings, Chinese ceramics and bronzes, Art Deco jewelry, and ancient Near East, Mesopotamian, or ancient Middle East items. In 2000, \"The Walters Art Gallery\" changed its long-time name to \"The Walters Art Museum\" to reflect its image as a large public institution and eliminate confusion among some of the increasing out-of-state visitors. The following year, \"The Walters\" (as it is often known locally) reopened its original main building after a dramatic three-year physical renovation and replacement of internal utilities and infrastructure. The Archimedes Palimpsest was on loan to the Walters Art Museum from a private collector for conservation and spectral imaging studies. Starting on October 1, 2006, the museum was enabled to make admission free to all, year-round, as a result of substantial grants given by Baltimore City and the surrounding suburban Baltimore County arts agencies and authorities.  In 2012, \"The Walters\" released nearly 20,000 of its own images of its collections on a Creative Commons license, and collaborated in  their upload to the world-wide web and the Internet on Wikimedia Commons. This was one of the largest and most comprehensive such releases made by any museum."

        "content": "Henry Walters assembled a collection of art produced during the Middle Ages in all the major artistic media of the period. This forms the basis of the Walters' medieval collection, for which the museum is best known internationally.  Considered one of the best collections of medieval art in the United States, the museum's holdings include examples of metalwork, sculpture, stained glass, textiles, icons, and other paintings. The collection is especially renowned for its ivories, enamels, reliquaries, early Byzantine silver, post-Byzantine art, illuminated manuscripts, and the largest and finest collection of Ethiopian Orthodox Church art outside Ethiopia. The Walters' medieval collection features unique objects such as the Byzantine agate Rubens Vase that belonged to the painter Rubens (accession no. 42.562) and the earliest-surviving image of the \"Virgin of Tenderness\", an ivory carving produced in Egypt in the 6th or 7th century (accession no. 71.297). Sculpted heads from the royal Abbey of St. Denis are rare surviving examples of portal sculptures that are directly connected with the origins of Gothic art in 12th-century France (accession nos. 27.21 and 27.22). An ivory casket covered with scenes of jousting knights is one of about a dozen such objects to survive in the world (accession no. 71.264). Many of these works are on display in the museum's galleries. Works from the medieval collection are also frequently included in special touring exhibitions, such as Treasures of Heaven, an exhibition about relics and reliquaries that was on view at the Cleveland Museum of Art in (Cleveland, Ohio), the Walters Art Museum, and the British Museum in London in 2010\u201311. Works in the medieval collection are the subject of active research by the curatorial and conservation departments of the museum, and visiting researchers frequently make use of the museum's holdings.  In-depth technical research carried on these objects is made available to the public through publications and exhibitions, as in the case of the Amandus Shrine (accession no. 53.9), which was featured in a small special exhibition titled The Special Dead in 2008\u201309. There are also Late Medieval devotional Italian paintings by these painters at the Walters: Tommaso da Modena, Pietro Lorenzetti, Andrea di Bartolo (Resurrection), Alberto Sotio, Bartolomeo di Tommaso (Death of Saint Francis), Naddo Ceccarelli, Master of Saint Verdiana, Niccolo di Segna (Saint Lucy), Orcagna, Olivuccio di Ciccarello, Master of Panzano Triptych and Giovanni del Biondo."

Highlights of the collection include Odalisque with Slave by Ingres (a second version); Claude Monet's Springtime; Alfred Sisley's panoramic view of the Seine Valley; and \u00c9douard Manet's realist masterpiece, The Caf\u00e9 Concert. Henry Walters was particularly interested in the courtly arts of 18th-century France. The museum's collection of S\u00e8vres porcelain includes a number of pieces that were made for members of the Royal Bourbon Court at Versailles Palace outside of Paris. Portrait miniatures and the examples of goldsmiths' works, especially snuffboxes and watches, are displayed in the Treasury, along with some exceptional 19th- and early-20th-century works. Among them are examples of Art Nouveau-styled  jewelry by Ren\u00e9 Lalique, jeweled objects by the House of Faberg\u00e9, including two Russian Imperial Easter eggs, and precious jewels by Tiffany and Co. of New York City. The Walters' collection presents an overview of 19th-century European art, particularly art from France. From the first half of the century come major paintings by Ingres, G\u00e9ricault, and Delacroix. William Walters stayed in Paris with his family during the Civil War, because of his notorious Southern-leanings, and he soon developed a keen interest in contemporary European painting. He either commissioned directly from the artists or purchased at auctions such major works by the Barbizon masters, including Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet and Henri Rousseau; the academic masters Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me and Lawrence Alma-Tadema; and even the modernists Monet, Manet, and Sisley, the Italian Antonio Rotta."

It belonged to Colonel Adrian Scrope, the regicide, and passed to his grandson John Scrope, a baron of the Exchequer who died without issue. The estate passed to the descendants of his sister Anne (died 1720), who had married Henry Fane of Brympton. Their second son, Thomas Fane, also a Bristol merchant, succeeded his uncle as Member of Parliament for Lyme Regis, beginning the Fane family's long association with the seat. Fane also succeeded a distant cousin and became 8th Earl of Westmoreland in 1762. The Fane family sold the 18th-century house and estate in 1986 to Sir Paul Getty and his wife Victoria Holdsworth. Getty restored the house and estate, adding a library to accommodate his book collection, and a theatre where performances were held for invited guests. Garsington Opera holds its annual summer festival on the grounds of the park. The area is known for its population of red kites. Once extinct in England and Scotland, the birds were reintroduced into England beginning in 1989. The area was not originally planned to be the first release site. It was originally intended to be Windsor Great Park, but at the last minute the landowner pulled out and the project nearly collapsed. Getty stepped in and offered Wormsley as an alternative. In 2011, Garsington Opera moved from Garsington Manor near Oxford to a purpose-built pavilion in the grounds of Wormsley."

The village has existed for many years, and tombstones in the graveyard indicate that Muslims were buried there some three to four hundred years ago.

Then from in the 1840s many other emigrants from Barbodhan went to the island of Mauritius, where they were later responsible for introducing hydroelectric power, as well as being involved in other trading and business concerns. The first Muslim mayor in Mauritius was originally from Barbodhan. Then came the migration to England from the 1950s to the 1970s. Once immigration to the United Kingdom became more difficult, a number of Barbodhians then left for Canada particularly during the period from the 1970s to the 1990s. A considerable number of Barbodhians undertook further migrations from one of these countries to another; such as from Burma to England, England to Canada or Mauritius to England. Despite the fact that Barbodhan is only a small village, its people have made valuable contributions in societies around the world. Barbodhians have set up many Waqfs or Religious Foundations to help poor, needy, disadvantaged and unfortunate members of society, particularly in Burma and Mauritius. The largest population of Barbodhians outside India is in Bolton, Greater Manchester, where the community settled in the 1950s and 1960s.

It opened for trains to Shoreham on 12 May 1840, and to London on 21 September 1841. The station site was extended for the opening of the Brighton Lewes and Hastings Railway on 8 June 1846 (which had been purchased by the L&BR in 1845). In July 1846, the L&BR merged with other railways to form the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway. Further extensions to the station occurred during the mid-19th century but only a limited number of additional platforms could be added because of the awkward sloping site. By the late 1870s the facilities were inadequate for the growing volume of traffic and so the existing platforms were lengthened to be able to accommodate two trains, and the three separate roofs were replaced by an overall roof during 1882/1883. The station has an impressive large double-spanned curved glass and iron roof covering all of the platforms, which was substantially renovated in 1999 and 2000. At the front of the station is a bus station. The station taxi rank is outside the rear of the station. A tunnel runs under the station which once provided an open-air cab run at a shallower gradient than Trafalgar Street outside, which had been the main approach to the station before the construction of Queen's Road (which was financially supported by the railway, and intended to improve access). The cab run was covered (forming a tunnel) when the station above was extended over it on cast iron columns. The cab run remains in situ but has been sealed at the station end. Help, a dog used to collect charitable donations, was displayed at the station following its death in 1891."

The tunnel entrance was filled in after new tracks were laid into the goods yard, but a portion of it was converted into offices during World War II, and these were in use until the early 21st century. A portion of the tunnel is still used by a local rifle club. The site of the goods yard has since been redeveloped, and much of it forms the New England Quarter."

During 1860\u20131861 John Chester Craven, the Locomotive Superintendent of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR) began the removal of a large chalk hill to the north of the station, which had been dumped during the excavation of the main line. The space created was used to accommodate a new much enlarged motive power depot in 1861, replacing the two existing facilities. During the early 1930s, following the electrification of the lines the steam motive power depot was rebuilt and reduced in size. It was closed 15 June 1961, but remained in use for stabling steam locomotives until 1964, and was demolished in 1966. The site is currently the Network Rail's ECR and infrastructure maintenance depot, and Southern's Lovers Walk Depot, used for servicing most of Southern's single voltage Class 377 Electrostar, Class 387 Electrostar and Class 313 fleets."

        "content": "The settlement goes back to a Slavonic settlement named Turguo in the shire of Neletici. There was presumably a wooden Slavonic castle located on the site of the present-day Hartenfels castle. In the 10th century it fell under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperors, and a stone castle was built, around which the settlement congregated. A market is attested in 1119. The town was located on the important trade-road, the via regia Lusatiae inferioris, between Leipzig and Frankfurt an der Oder that crossed the river Elbe at a ford east of Torgau. Torgau belonged to the duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg, which in 1356 was raised to be the Electorate of Saxony. After the last Ascanian duke died without issue in 1423, the Electorate passed to the Wettin dynasty, which took up its residence at Torgau. Following the Treaty of Leipzig partition of the Wettin inheritance on 26 August 1485, Torgau fell to the Ernestine line. Frederick III, Elector of Saxony and his successors had Hartenfels Castle at Torgau built by architect Conrad Pfl\u00fcger and his successor Konrad Krebs. The Ernestine court resided mainly in Torgau and in Weimar. From 1525 onwards, Torgau became the sole residence. Hartenfels Castle is the largest completely preserved castle of the early Renaissance in Germany. After the Battle of M\u00fchlberg in 1547, Torgau fell to the Albertine line. During the Reformation, the town council closed all cloisters in 1523. Citizens of Torgau destroyed the paintings and statues of saints in the churches and stormed the Franciscan monastery. After Luther had driven Andreas Karlstadt (Bodenstein) from Saxony in 1524, he enforced the expulsion of Karlstadt's followers in Torgau in 1529. Katharina von Bora, the wife of Martin Luther, died in Torgau and is buried there in St Marien, Torgau. The court chapel, constructed in 1543-44 by Nikolaus Gromann, was consecrated by Martin Luther on 5 October 1544; it is thus the second oldest newly built protestant church in the world, after the court chapel of Neuburg Castle which was consecrated in 1543. The Torgauer Artikel, a draft of the Augsburg Confession was composed by Luther, Melanchthon, Bugenhagen and Jonas in the electoral superindenture in 1530 (Wintergr\u00fcn). The Lutheran Formula of Concord was written in Torgau in 1576. The first German opera, Heinrich Sch\u00fctz's Dafne, was presented at the court in Torgau, 1627. In the Battle of Torgau, on 3 November 1760, a Prussian army under the command of King Friedrich the Great defeated a larger Austrian army under the command of Field Marshal Leopold Josef Graf Daun, a major battle of the Seven Years' War. After the Congress of Vienna, it was passed to Prussia in 1815."

The unit commanders met the following day at Torgau for an official handshake. This marked the beginning of the line of contact between Soviet and American forces but not the finalized occupation zones. In fact, the area surrounding Torgau initially occupied by U.S. forces was in July 1945 given over to Soviet forces in compliance with the Yalta Agreement. After the war, in 1949, the film Encounter at the Elbe was released by Mosfilm about the meeting of both armies. Torgau was one of the prisons in which Reinhold Eggers spent his postwar imprisonment after he had been sentenced by the Soviets. He had been the security officer at Oflag IV-C during the war in Colditz Castle."

A feud started over Section 23, where the Stonegate subdivision is now. William Chormicle had legally bought the property, but William \"Wirt\" Jenkins was already storing grain on it and said he had filed for ownership. During a heated dispute, Chormicle and a friend shot and killed two of Jenkins's cowhands. They were acquitted in court. Jenkins, however, was the local justice of the peace, with friends of his own, and the feud quickly grew into war. Former Los Angeles Rangers (among whom Jenkins had fought) and other notables were drawn in. The war claimed dozens of lives and foiled a negotiator, a forest ranger whom President Theodore Roosevelt had sent in to quell it."

The line was opened as far as Bowenfels, just to the west, in 1869, but Lithgow station was not opened until 1877. Although it was superseded in 1910 by more modern engineering methods, including ten tunnels, parts of the Zig Zag have been developed into a popular tourist attraction. Following a period of industrialisation in the late 1860s and 1870s, the town of Lithgow boomed during the 1880s, and it was incorporated as a borough in 1889. The town is the centre of a coal mining district and there is one coal-powered power station nearby. It is the site of Australia's first commercially viable steel mill, the ruins of which are open for inspection at \"Blast Furnace Park\". Due to the abundance of coal and relative proximity to Sydney, in the areas surrounding Lithgow is one of the largest power stations in NSW, the Mount Piper power station.  The Wallerawang power station closed in 2014 and was subsequently demolished. The (now demolished) Lithgow Power Station was in use from 1928 to 1964."

M-22 is an original trunkline designation dating back to the 1919 designation of the system. Reroutings have moved the highway closer to the water between Suttons Bay and Traverse City. A section of the highway was used temporarily for another highway, M-109. Two sections of the highway have been designated as separate Pure Michigan Byways. The highway marker is used in marketing by a local business as a symbol of the region, a trademark for which has been the subject of legal controversies. A popular roadway in the area with tourists, the highway's marker has also been the subject of sign theft."

        "content": "The southern terminus is at US Highway\u00a031 (US\u00a031)  northeast of Manistee and the northern terminus is in Traverse City. In between the trunkline loops north along Lake Michigan to Northport before turning south along the West Arm of Grand Traverse Bay. The road itself comprises numerous turns and hills, making it a very popular drive for tourists visiting the area from areas such as Chicago and Detroit, especially during autumn. The road runs north to the village of Onekama running east and north of Portage Lake before returning north to Arcadia. M-22 turns northeasterly to curve around the north shore of Crystal Lake after passing through Elberta and Frankfort. South of the Platte River, the highway crosses into the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. East of Platte Lake, M-22 turns northward again toward Empire, headquarters of the national park. M-22 takes the inland route between Little and Big Glen lakes, losing the Lake Michigan Circle Tour designation to M-109 until the two meet again in Glen Arbor. The roadway follows the shoreline of Pyramid Point and passes east out of the national park before turning north to Leland. Leland is home to Fishtown, and the ferries to the Manitou Islands off the coast of the Leelanau Peninsula. Continuing northward, M-22 reaches its northernmost extent in Northport before turning south. It passes through the reservation of the Grand Traverse Band of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians in Peshawbestown, home to one of the tribe's two casinos. Further south is the community of Suttons Bay located on the small bay of the same name. From here south, the highway runs just off the shore of the Grand Traverse Bay south to Greilickville. Just south of Greilickville, M-22 enters a section of the city of Traverse City that is located in Leelanau County, Michigan formed by an acquisition of a neighborhood of Greilickville. Here is the eastern junction between M-22 and M-72. The two highways run concurrently along Grandview Parkway to Division Street. There they meet US\u00a031/M-37 and M-22 ends. A portion of this road has been designated a what is now called a Pure Michigan Scenic Byway by the state of Michigan."

        "content": "Broneah Kiteboarding, a company based in Traverse City, has adopted the M-22 marker as a logo and sells merchandise such as clothing and bumper stickers featuring it. As such, the logo has become a popular symbol for the company as well as a cultural symbol for the western Grand Traverse Bay area.  The private corporation has attempted to trademark the road sign, which has been legally opposed by the Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette; that formal opposition was removed by his successor Dana Nessel in 2019. In 2015, the readers of USA Today voted M-22 the \"best scenic autumn drive\" in the nation, noting that it offers \" of stellar autumn leaf-peeping\". Due to the popularity of the roadway, sign theft along parts of M-22 has become an issue for MDOT. The department announced in 2016 that it was removing the \"M\" from the top of some of the M-22 markers to combat the issue. The state had replaced about 90\u00a0signs in the previous three years, and a department spokesman said the popularity of the highway from merchandise sales and scenic travelers factored into those thefts. The new signs cost between $325 and $350 apiece to manufacture, no different from what the standard M-22 signs cost, and MDOT hoped that the modified signs will prove less popular with thieves. The new signs will be installed as replacements in the areas with the most thefts, like Leelanau County, while the rest of the highway will still receive the standard M-22 marker. A year later, sign theft was still an issue. The department started testing pavement markings because the other efforts had failed. The markings cost $175, but they last only three years compared to the ten-year lifespan of a sign."

M-22 would be rerouted back around to the present routing the next year, and M-109 was designated on the west side of the lake in its place. Until 1936, M-22's route was on Cherry Bend and Center roads in Leelanau County to Suttons Bay. At that time, M-22 was relocated along the west arm of Grand Traverse Bay onto Center Road up to Crain Hill Road In 1949, M-22 was relocated the rest of the way to Suttons Bay, and the former M-22 on Cherry Bend and Center roads became County Road 633. and in 1945, the last gravel stretch of M-22 from Leland to Northport was paved. In Traverse City, M-22 originally started at Front and Union streets going west on Front to Elmwood, turning north onto Elmwood, then west on Bay Street to Greilickville. It was relocated onto the newly built Grand View Parkway in 1952, from Greilickville to Division Street (relocated US\u00a031). In 2002, the route of M-22 from the Benzie\u2013Leelanau county line northward to Northport and then south to Traverse City was designated as part of a Michigan Heritage Route along with M-109 and M-204 as the Leelanau Scenic Heritage Route; this moniker was renamed Pure Michigan Byway at the end of 2014.

Britain also retained the Spanish ports of Gibraltar and Mah\u00f3n, captured during the War of the Spanish Succession. When Elisabeth Farnese became Philip's second wife in 1714, he already had two sons who were next in line for the Spanish throne. She wanted to create an Italian inheritance for her own children, while Philip viewed regaining these territories as important for his prestige. Spain re-occupied Sardinia unopposed in 1717 but a landing on Sicily in 1718 led to the War of the Quadruple Alliance. The Royal Navy's victory at Cape Passaro in August isolated the Spanish invasion force and ultimately forced them to surrender to Austrian troops in 1719. In the 1720 Treaty of The Hague, Spain renounced its Italian possessions, in return for a guarantee Parma would go to Elisabeth's eldest son Charles on the death of the childless Duke of Parma. The new British monarch, George I, agreed to raise the question of returning Gibraltar in Parliament 'at a favourable opportunity.' Frustration at the lack of progress on this and commercial tensions led to the 1727 to 1729 Anglo-Spanish War. Military action was primarily limited to an attack on Porto Bello, Panama by the British and an unsuccessful siege of Gibraltar by Spain, who also imposed restrictions on British merchants. The two countries agreed a truce in February 1728; hoping to deter Spain from an alliance with Austria, British envoy Benjamin Keene negotiated the Treaty of El Pardo in March. Considered too lenient by London, the agreement was repudiated, leading to the Congress of Soissons. There the British negotiated with a position of strength - a strategy that proved successful; most notably preventing a Spanish-Austrian alliance against Britain."

        "content": "The Treaty of Seville is best understood in the context of a number of European diplomatic issues over the period, one being Elisabeth Farnese's desire for an Italian kingdom for her son. Another was the 1716 Anglo-French Alliance; although both sides grew increasingly suspicious of each other, the succession of George I in 1714 and his concern for Hanover made this more important to Britain than previously. Emperor Charles VI wanted the other Powers to support the 1713 Pragmatic Sanction and thus ensure the succession of his daughter Maria Theresa. Commercial issues included the Austrian-owned Ostend Company, which competed for the East Indies trade with British, French and Dutch merchants, as well as Spanish concerns over British incursions in New Spain. The result was an almost continuous series of conferences and agreements, including the 1720 to 1724 Congress of Cambrai and the 1721 Treaty of Madrid. The 1725 Peace of Vienna between Austria and Spain was followed by the Treaty of Hanover, signed by France, Britain, Hanover and Prussia. Europe was on the verge of a general war, avoided when French chief minister Cardinal Fleury invited Austria, France and Britain to the Congress of Soissons, although Spain was excluded. Trading privileges for British and French merchants in Cadiz were restored and compensation paid for losses, with an Anglo-Spanish commission established to discuss commercial issues in the Americas. Britain and France supported the rights of Elisabeth's son Charles to Parma, with the addition of the Duchy of Tuscany; Spain could also send 6,000 troops to garrison the duchies in advance. These terms were presented to the Spanish, who signed on 9 November, the Dutch Republic joining the Treaty on 29th."

The Anglo-French Alliance lapsed in 1731 and Britain agreed the 1731 Treaty of Vienna with Austria, although they co-operated with France to ensure Charles inherited Parma in 1732. As a result of the 1733 to 1735 War of the Polish Succession, he exchanged it for the Kingdom of Naples and in 1759 became king of Spain. Anglo-Spanish tensions increased with the founding of the British colony of Georgia in 1732, which Spain considered a threat to Spanish Florida, vital to protect shipping routes with mainland Spain. For their part, the British viewed the 1733 Pacte de Famille between Louis XV and his uncle Philip as the first step in being replaced by France as Spain's largest trading partner. These ultimately led first to the War of Jenkins' Ear in 1739, then the 1740 to 1748 War of the Austrian Succession."

The Old Town is found between the two brooks running through town, the Wolfsbach in the east and the W\u00f6rsbach in the west, on a high ridge reaching up to  above sea level. This comes to an end in the Old Town's north end with the castle and palace crags, behind which the two brooks run together. On the Wolfsbach, remnants of the like-named, now forsaken village can still be made out. The estate agent Gassenbach in the town's south goes back to an old settlement called Gassenbach; for the last few years, it has belonged to the Dom\u00e4ne Mechtildshausen, an organic farming operation. West of town, beyond the W\u00f6rsbach valley, lies another high ridge with peaks ranging from the Hohe Kanzel () to the Ro\u00dfberg () and the R\u00fcgert () to the Rosenkippel (); to the south, the Galgenberg () forms another high area over to the Dasbach Heath. Just under the western heights run the Autobahn A\u00a03 and the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line (in the Idsteintunnel along the slope). On the other side of the R\u00fcgert are the constituent communities of Oberauroff and Niederauroff in the valley of the Auroffer Bach.

Besides the Hexenturm near the old Nassau castle that has already been mentioned, the town has a mediaeval town centre with many timber-frame buildings. The town's oldest preserved house was originally built in 1410. From the documentary mention in 1102 until 1721, Idstein was, with interruptions, residence of the Counts of Nassau-Idstein and other Nassau lines. One of the Counts, Adolf of Germany, was, as a compromise candidate, the Holy Roman Emperor from 1292 to 1298, later falling in battle against the anti-king Albrecht I of Habsburg. The Nassau Counts' holdings were subdivided many times among heirs, with the parts being brought together again whenever a line died out. This yielded an older Nassau-Idstein line from 1480 to 1509, later merging once again with Nassau-Wiesbaden and Nassau-Weilburg and, from 1629 to 1721, a newer Nassau-Idstein line. In the 17th century, Count Johann of Nassau-Idstein persecuted witches in Idstein. In 1721, Idstein passed to Nassau-Ottweiler, and in 1728 to Nassau-Usingen, thereby losing its status as a residence town, although it became the seat of the Nassau Archives and of an Oberamt. Nassau-Usingen was united with Nassau-Weilburg in 1806 into the Duchy of Nassau, becoming a member of the Confederation of the Rhine. After the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, Prussia annexed the Duchy as the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau. The residential palace from the 17th century is used by the Pestalozzischule as a school building. It was expanded with a new building below the palace. From the late 18th century to the mid 20th, Idstein was the centre of an important leather industry. During the Second World War, many women became forced labour for work in the tanneries. In 1959, the dominant tannery in the middle of the town core was shut down for economic reasons. The lands right at the edge of the Old Town lay empty and were used until the 1980s as a carpark. Today, new shops and apartments surround the L\u00f6herplatz, which is now a marketplace. The private Kalmenhof clinic in Idstein was drawn into the Nazi Euthanasia programme. Under Action T4, the Kalmenhof served as a way station for the \"killing institute\" at Hadamar. After the gassings at Hadamar came to an end in the face of public protests, especially from the churches, the Kalmenhof itself, in the course of Aktion Brandt, became a killing institute; patients here were murdered with poison injections. Shortly after the war, reports of young wards being mishandled came to light. Eleven formerly independent villages were merged as of 1971 into Idstein, under the framework of municipal reform."

The church was decorated in Baroque style in the 17th century, unusually rich for a Protestant church. The ceiling in the main nave was thoroughly covered with large-scale oil paintings from the Dutch school of Rubens. Several well known works by Rubens form the basis of scenes from the life of Christ on the walls and ceiling; for example The Wedding at Cana on the south wall is largely based on Rubens's painting The Feast of Herod which hangs today in the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh. The church's name refers to the church union declared in Idstein in 1817 whereby the Reformed and Lutheran churches in the Duchy of Nassau united to the Protestant Church in Nassau, today the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau."

A bridged gap in the crags separates it from the old castle area from the 11th century; through this gap today runs an important road. During the time when the last Idstein prince, Georg August Samuel von Nassau-Idstein (1665\u20131721), was ruling, the building was given its interior design under Maximilian von Welsch's guidance. The now partly missing ceiling stucco was done by Carlo Maria Pozzi. At the main entrance door is a great alliance coat of arms of Count Johann and his consort from about 1635.

The castle's keep, known as the Hexenturm,  tall, walls more than  thick, even given overall diameter of just under , is Idstein's oldest building. Dendrochronological borings show that work began on the tower as early as 1170 (not, as had long been assumed, about 1350). It received its \"butter churn\" shape, built in stages, about 1500. (Building researchers see in it a rare time capsule, because in the 20th century, almost nothing was changed beyond the last work in 1963, which entailed nothing more than some new plastering outside and small touch-ups with cement inside). No witches or warlocks were ever imprisoned in the Hexenturm. However, on a cliff wall at the foot of the keep, a plaque has been placed in memory of those murdered after being accused of witchcraft. Idstein was notorious for its witch trials about 1676."

        "content": "The old town core is small. It is distinguished by a many timber-frame buildings, some opulently painted and decorated, in which the Rhenish influences on the Hessian-Franconian timber-frame building style can already be seen. Therefore, Idstein is part of the German Framework Road. The town core stretches between the castle area with its Hexenturm and the H\u00f6erhof, the representative timber-frame building built in 1620\u20131626 by the palace building master on the heights across from the Schloss. The painter Ernst Toepfer bought the property in 1911 and restored the building. Today, the H\u00f6erhof is a stylish hotel and restaurant with an idyllic inner courtyard. Right at the Nassau castle's gateway arch building, standing over K\u00f6nig-Adolf-Platz, is the Town Hall (Rathaus) from 1698, in a rather odd way over the passage that separates the Old Town from the castle. Also worth mentioning is the carillon (Glockenspiel). A rockslide from the crags destroyed the Town Hall in 1928, but it was rebuilt between 1932 and 1934. K\u00f6nig-Adolf-Platz is seamlessly ringed by representative timber-frame houses, mainly dating from about 1600. To the Town Hall's left stands the Schiefes Haus (\"Crooked House\"), which was renovated a few years ago, and which Nicolay, the major of the town militia, had built in 1527. On the way out of the square towards the Unionskirche, is the richly adorned Killingerhaus built in 1527, which has served as a museum and tourism office since 1987. It is one of Germany's most important timber-frame houses with regards to art history. According to one story, the building was originally built in Strasbourg, and when the owner moved to Idstein, he brought the house with him. The rest of the old downtown core is also characterized by its many timber-frame houses and estate complexes from the 16th and 17th centuries, some of which have been lavishly renovated. This is particularly so along the Obergasse (\"Upper Lane\"), which leads from K\u00f6nig-Adolf-Platz out of the town and meets the old town wall on the H\u00f6erhof heights. Somewhat below that stands the Stockheimer Hof, which was built in the late 16th century as the seat of the Lords of Stockheim. After they died out, ownership passed to the family von Calm between 1768 and 1776, giving the property on which it stands its current name, Kalmenhof. Until 2005, the timber-frame building was being used by the Sozialp\u00e4dagogisches Zentrum SPZ Kalmenhof. On the way from the Killingerhaus to the H\u00f6erhof, one house has a humorous Dog Latin inscription. \"Sita vsvilate inis taberce inis\" (which is actually a misspelling of Sieht aus wie Latein, ist aber keines \u2013 \"Looks like Latin, but is not\"). As a last witness to the former leather industry, the Gerberhaus (\"Tanners' House\") stands at L\u00f6herplatz below the Unionskirche; it is the former storage shed on the W\u00f6rsbach. L\u00f6herplatz was, beginning in the Middle Ages the place where the tanneries and leather processing works were found owing to the demand for water, and also the need to have the works outside town given the attendant stench that went forth from them. The Gerberhaus, after a thorough renovation, nowadays serves as an exhibition and cabaret event venue. Stretching east of the old town core from the marketplace, which itself dates from about 1700, is a Baroque town expansion. Its streets match the ideals of town building at that time with right-angled intersections, the timber-frame houses lining them pragmatic and far less decorated than in the town core. Building \"sins\" and great changes have been avoided, and instead, restoration is what was more often done, thereby preserving an impressive, unbroken ensemble of these buildings."

Bearing obvious witness to the Limes is a replica of a watchtower towards Niedernhausen near Dasbach on the Dasbacher H\u00f6he (heights). Even the Dasbach churchtower supposedly stands on the foundation of a Roman watchtower.

After the end of the war, the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr\u00e4berf\u00fcrsorge built a central memorial in Idstein, where all war dead from the district of Untertaunus were to be reburied. There are a total of 250 graves on the Idstein war cemetery. Of those buried there, 234 people are known by name. 10 dead are civilians. There are also six graves with fallen soldiers and Russian prisoners of war from the First World War. Most of the dead at the Idstein war cemetery died after the fighting ended. There is evidence that prisoners from the Rhine meadow camps (\u201eRheinwiesenlager\u201c) came to the Idstein military hospitals."

On three days, during the first weekend in the Hesse summer holidays, up to 75 different jazz groups on a dozen stages play from Friday evening to Sunday live in an open-air concert. The Unionskirche is the location for choral concerts of the Idsteiner Kantorei conducted by Carsten Koch twice a year, such as Orff's Carmina Burana and Bach's Weihnachtsoratorium in 2009. For the annual European Heritage Days the \"Nassauische Kammerphilharmonie\" has performed a Sinfoniekonzert on the occasion of the Tag des offenen Denkmals, including a series of Beethoven's symphonies. The Rheingau Musik Festival staged concerts here with Elizabeth Parcells, Chanticleer and ensemble amarcord, among others. In the church St. Martin an annual choral concert is performed by the combined choirs Chor St. Martin and the chamber choir Martinis, conducted by Franz Fink, such as Bach's St Matthew Passion in 1998 with Elisabeth Scholl, Andreas Scholl and Max van Egmond and again in 2009 with Andreas Pruys and Klaus Mertens. The concert of 2011 was Handel's Messiah, with soloists Katia Plaschka, Andreas Scholl, Ulrich Cordes and Markus Flaig. Other concerts in the church have included music of Graham Waterhouse, the duo propram of Giora Feidman and organist Matthias Eisenberg in 2008 and a concert of Kalevi Kiviniemi in 2010. Although the town of Idstein hosts only a small vineyard, whose wines are not for sale but poured at special occasions, there is nonetheless a yearly wine festival, mainly presenting wines from the near Rheingau. Every other year, in the spring, the Idsteiner Hexenmarkt (Witches' Market) is held in the castle and palace area, an event with medieval crafts and entertainment. In the summer, from June to August on the third day of each of those months, the Alteburger Markt is held in Idstein-Heftrich, on the site of the Roman castrum Alteburg. The youth centre in Idstein offers a monthly event plan with hip hop, metal, DJ night and punk rock, offering at irregular intervals, for instance live concerts by local bands. Since 2003, the \"Monkey Jump Festival\" has been held annually. A great number of bands perform in the town's various pubs and restaurants during the festival. Since 2004, the Idstein Women's Day Frauen in Balance (\"Women in Balance\") has been held annually at the Gerberhaus, in collaboration with the Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis equality commissioner."

The parish covers  at an elevation of . In the 2011 census the parish\u2014which includes the settlement of Stubhampton to the north\u2014had 119 dwellings, 108 households and a population of 233. The parish has three round barrows and an unexcavated Iron Age enclosure with a 15' deep ditch, which Pevsner suspects was built in a hurry. The medieval settlements in the parish were Stubhampton and Gunville. The parish church, dedicated to St Mary, is on the edge of Tarrant Gunville. It is on the site of an earlier building which probably dated from around 1100. The present building has a south porch, aisles and tower arch that are partly 14th-century, and a 15th-century west tower that was partly rebuilt in the 16th century, but the chancel and nave were rebuilt in 1843. The architect of the rebuilding was Thomas Henry Wyatt. Eastbury House, the surviving part of a much larger house designed by John Vanbrugh and built between 1717 and 1738, stands just east of Tarrant Gunville village. The larger part of the house was demolished in 1782. The grounds still display evidence of the original gardens, designed by Charles Bridgeman. It is probable that several of the ashlar and flint houses in the village were built using material taken from the demolished house. The photographer Thomas Wedgwood moved into the surviving part of Eastbury in 1800; his brother, the potter Josiah, had bought nearby Gunville House in 1799, shortly after its construction. The modern village hall was completed in 2001. There are 23 structures in the parish that are listed by English Heritage for their special historical or architectural interest. These include Eastbury House (Grade I) and the parish church (Grade II*)."

After the Bern Switzerland Temple was dedicated in 1955, Latter-day Saints throughout Europe visited it for the Endowment and other temple rites. After 1957, East German governmental restrictions on foreign travel prevented the country's Latter-day Saints\u2014about 5,000 in 1970\u2014from easily obtaining visas to travel to the temple. Church members repeatedly applied for visas, were rejected, then applied again. An attempt in the early 1970s by Henry Burkhardt, the de jure head of the church in East Germany, to present the government with a list of 300 church members interested in visiting the temple almost led to his arrest. The LDS Church appointed Burkhardt as president of the Germany Dresden Mission in 1969 to comply with a new law requiring churches to be led by East Germans. In the 1970s his role gave Burkhardt access to visas to travel to LDS general conferences in Salt Lake City, Utah. Obtaining the visas required him to meet often with East German government officials, whom church leaders encouraged Burkhardt to build relationships with despite his reluctance. In 1973 and/or 1978, H. Burke Peterson of the Presiding Bishopric, suggested to Burkhardt that the church build an endowment house in East Germany as an alternative to a temple."

        "content": "In 1978, the East German government unexpectedly suggested building an LDS temple within the country. Doing so would reduce visa requests, and was part of a new government policy to cooperate with churches in hopes of obtaining hard currency through construction. The church emphasized temples'  unantastbar (\"sanctity\") nature to the government, but initially planned for a chapel and an endowment house in one building, so that the latter could be used with the chapel if desecrated. The church intended to locate the building in Karl-Marx-Stadt, a longtime center of Communist ideology, as its LDS congregation needed a new chapel. In 1980 the local government rejected a new chapel within the city despite the national government's support, and instead assigned the building to Freiberg, about  away. The choice of the small town instead of a larger city like Leipzig or Dresden surprised members. Although disappointed at first, Burkhardt and church leaders in Utah came to see the Freiberg location as superior. By April 1981, city officials' welcoming of the project ahead of the forthcoming 800th anniversary of Freiberg's founding in 1986 encouraged the church to plan for a separate chapel and temple. In 1982 the government also permitted the church to acquire a  hillside site instead of the normal long-term lease. The church announced the forthcoming Freiberg Germany Temple in October 1982, and Thomas S. Monson, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, presided over the groundbreaking on 23 April 1983. The plans did not include an angel Moroni and no request to the government for one was made, although it would likely have permitted a statue if asked."

The church also received approval to tap the new Trans-Siberian Pipeline, which passed near the temple, to heat the buildings with natural gas instead of brown coal, which would have required a large, dirty coal plant on the site. The construction used triple glazing and other advanced methods unusual for East Germany, and despite restrictions on imported materials, architects were able to obtain three high-quality Czech crystal chandeliers for the Celestial and sealing rooms at the Leipzig Trade Fair. Because the church was unsure of how long the temple's sacredness would remain intact, however, the bulk of the temple's materials were of \"average\" or \"mediocre\" quality, and steps were not taken to ease future expansion. Unlike the contemporaneous Stockholm and Frankfurt temples, for example, the Freiberg temple did not include an air conditioning system despite its availability in East Germany, causing hundreds to faint during temple rites."

As East Germany sought in the 1980s to improve its image abroad, however, the Latter-day Saints' alleged ties to the United States government and other Western powers worked in the church's favor. The Stasi's close monitoring of East German members over the years gave the church credibility, as the government came to see Latter-day Saints as citizens of good character who, in keeping with the 12th Article of Faith, did not conspire against the nation. Accordingly, it agreed that no one without a recommend would enter the temple after the dedication, and fears of electronic surveillance proved groundless."

The temple received badly needed air conditioning in 1994. Renovations began in 2001 which nearly doubled the square footage to  and added 12 oxen to support the baptismal font, a waiting room for those not able to enter the temple, a matron and brides room, as well as an office for the temple president. On December 20, 2001 an angel Moroni statue was placed on top of the temple. A second open house was held August 17-31, 2002. After renovations, Gordon B.

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum is the presidential library and museum of John Fitzgerald Kennedy (1917\u20131963), the 35th president of the United States (1961\u20131963). It is located on Columbia Point in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, next to the University of Massachusetts at Boston, the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, and the Massachusetts Archives and Commonwealth Museum. Designed by the architect I. M. Pei, the building is the official repository for original papers and correspondence of the Kennedy Administration, as well as special bodies of published and unpublished materials, such as books and papers by and about Ernest Hemingway. The library and museum is part of the Presidential Library System, which is administered by the Office of Presidential Libraries, a part of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The library and Museum were dedicated in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter and members of the Kennedy family. It can be reached from nearby Interstate 93 or via shuttle bus or walk from the JFK/UMass stop on the Red Line of Boston's MBTA system."

        "content": "During a weekend visit to Boston on October 19, 1963, President Kennedy, along with John Carl Warnecke \u2014 the architect who would design the President's  tomb in Arlington \u2014 viewed several locations offered by Harvard as a site for the library and museum. At the time there were only four other Presidential Libraries: the Hoover Presidential Library, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, the Truman Library, and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library. They were all scattered around the country in small towns from New York to Iowa. Kennedy had not decided on any design concept yet, but he felt that the existing presidential libraries were placed too \"far away from scholarly resources.\" Kennedy chose a plot of land next to the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration. The building would face the Charles River which was a few feet away, and on the other side of which, the dormitories that included Winthrop House where Kennedy spent his upperclassman days. Since Kennedy encouraged his administration to save effects of both personal and official nature, the complex would not just be a collection of the President's papers, but \"a complete record of a Presidential era.\" Therefore, the building would have the word \"museum\" appended to its name as the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum."

        "content": "After President Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, his family and friends discussed how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months, and visited with architects from around the world including Pietro Belluschi and others from the United States, Brazil's Lucio Costa, and Italy's Franco Albini. Mrs. Kennedy and others met with the candidates together at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis, Massachusetts, and visited several in their offices. The committee also conducted a secretive process whereby the architects voted anonymously for the most capable of their colleagues. Progress on the building began shortly after his death. On January 13, 1964, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy announced that a taped oral-history project was to be undertaken for inclusion in the library. The project would feature administration staff, friends, family, and politicians from home and abroad. The Attorney General also announced that Eugene R. Black Sr. agreed to serve as chairman of the board of trustees and that $1 million of Black's $10 million goal had been given to the trust by the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation. The death of the President was still fresh in the hearts and minds of the American public and by March of that year $4.3 million had been pledged, including 18,727 unsolicited donations from the public. Large donations came from the Hispanic world with Venezuela pledging $100,000 and Governor of Puerto Rico Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn offering the same. The oral-history project also began recording, starting with Jacqueline Kennedy and Robert Kennedy. Originally projected to consist of interviews with 150 people, 178 had agreed to participate and the total number of expected participants doubled to 300, with just one person (a Secret Service agent) declining to take part. Also by this time fourteen architects were named to serve on a design advisory committee: Over the following months pledges continued to funnel in for the building still being conceptualized by the various architects. Some notable donations include $900,000 handed over to Postmaster General John A. Gronouski on July 9, 1964. It was the sum of a campaign encompassing 102 Federal agencies. Gronouski said many of the Federal employee contributions were in the form of a $5 withholding each payday for a period of three years. The next day the Indian ambassador to the United States, Braj Kumar Nehru. presented Black with a check for $100,000 during a ceremony at the River Club. Nehru said that the Indian people were hit by a \"sad blow\" when the President died, and that they held him \"in the highest regard, esteem and affection.\" He desired for Indian students abroad in the United States to use the library, then still planned for construction at Harvard along the banks of the Charles River."

        "content": "On December 13, 1964, the Kennedy family announced that I. M. Pei was unanimously chosen by a subcommittee as the architect of the library. Even though Pei was relatively unknown amongst the list of candidates, Mrs. Kennedy, who viewed him as filled with promise and imagination and after spending several months inspecting the many architects' offices and creations, selected him to create the vision she held for the project. Pei did not have a design yet, but the idea as described by Robert Kennedy was to \"stimulate interest in politics.\" Meanwhile, the suggestion that Harvard may not be a suitable site for the library had begun cropping up. When asked if Pei may have had to start from scratch, he said this was the case. With an \"encouraging grin\" Robert Kennedy simply wished Mr. Pei \"Good luck.\" Mrs. Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. \"He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem,\" she said. \"He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful.\" Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it \"really an emotional decision\", she explained: \"He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him.\" Not long before Pei was selected, the $10 million goal set by Black had been reached. By 1965, fundraising was suspended when the contributions reached $20 million."

        "content": "In January 1966, when Massachusetts Governor John A. Volpe signed a bill allowing the state to purchase the land for the site \u2014 an old train yard belonging to the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) \u2014 it was expected that the project would be complete by 1970. The original design was a large complex comprising the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum, the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and an Institute of Politics. However the project faced many delays. The MBTA would not agree to remove the heavy machinery from the land until 1970. By that time construction costs had risen to over $20 million. Only now could Pei prepare a six-month study of the site's soil, and he said the \"money we had six years ago, today will barely pay for 60 percent of the original plans.\" Robert Kennedy, by then a senator from New York, had been serving as president of the John F. Kennedy Library Corporation until he was assassinated in 1968. Weeks before, William Manchester and Harper & Row donated $750,000 to the library. The first in a series of installments expected to total $5 million, came from the profits of the book The Death of a President which caused a bitter feud between the Kennedys and Manchester. Mrs. Kennedy remarked \"I think it is so beautiful what Mr. Manchester did. I am glad that Senator Kennedy knew about it before he died.\" The youngest of the Kennedy brothers, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, would step down as vice president of the corporation to fill the newly vacant position. By 1971, construction had still not begun; researchers and scholars were forced to work out of the Federal Records Center which was temporarily housing some of the 15 million documents and manuscripts. Pei said there was finally \"a clear way ahead\"; however, he was asked to save on construction expenses by using inexpensive materials. This would translate into Pei working with concrete instead of his preferred stone. On May 22, 1971, President Lyndon B. Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy as president, saw the dedication of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum in Austin, Texas. On the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, and next to the LBJ School of Public Affairs, he would beat the Kennedy team to building the first Presidential Library that also served as a place of scholarly research. He would not live to see work begin on his predecessor's. Meanwhile, the Cambridge community was in fierce opposition to having the library being built in Cambridge at all. Although originally welcomed in 1965, the library was now seen as a great attractor of over a million annual tourists who would change the neighborhood with \"hordes of tourists, automobiles, fast-food franchises and souvenir shops,\" as well as cause a negative environmental impact. One neighborhood group filed a lawsuit in federal court demanding that the General Services Administration study, which found that the great number of visitors would have \"no adverse effect on the area,\" be reexamined. Stephen E. Smith, a Kennedy in-law who heads the John F. Kennedy Library Corporation decided that \"we want the Kennedy Library to be a happy place. It would not be in keeping with the nature of this memorial for it to open in an atmosphere of discord and controversy.\" And in February 1975 the plans for having the library where President Kennedy would have wanted it, were dropped."

        "content": "The new location of the site was Columbia Point in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, near the University of Massachusetts Boston, described as a group of \"massive, blocky structures...in sharp contrast to the mellow and urbane atmosphere of the library's original site near Harvard Square.\" The site was originally a garbage dump, Pei recalls finding old refrigerators and appliances under the soil. In all seriousness, he asserted that one could toss a lit match on the earth and watch the ground ignite as the soil emitted methane gas. One thing the site did have going for it was that the community was not opposed to the area being landscaped to house the library. June 12, 1977, marked the official groundbreaking for the library with construction following in August. Although the site was a landfill it did overlook Boston, Dorchester Bay and the ocean. The area was covered in  of earth and topsoil. Pei was particularly proud of the landscaping results. The design would be a simple geometric structure with a large glass pavilion. The concrete tower stands  tall and houses offices and archives. A circular section contains two theaters and is connected to the tower by the  grey-glass pavilion. The concrete finish of the building directly reflects the budget. With more money Pei would have made the building with stone which he believes offers a nicer finish with more detail. The materials chosen kept the costs within budget, in total costing $20.8 million. Over 30 million people contributed to the cost of construction, which more than 225 construction workers labored to complete before the end of 1979."

Outside the building on the green, on a blue-carpeted stage with a bank of yellow chrysanthemums sat the Kennedy family and those close to them. Among many others, President Jimmy Carter was in their company. The ceremony began with President Kennedy's daughter, Caroline Kennedy, introducing her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., who read from the Stephen Spender poem, I Think Continually of Those Who Were Truly Great. President Carter said of John F. Kennedy that he embodied \"the ideals of a generation as few public figures have ever done in the history of the earth.\" He spoke of openly weeping upon hearing about the death of Kennedy, something that he had not done since his own father died, ten years before. Afterwards, he accepted the library \"on behalf of the American people\" and the National Archives and Records Administration. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, said of his brother's life, that it \"was a voyage of discovery, a quest for excellence that inspired universal trust and faith. In that brief unfinished journey, he made us believe once more in the great historic purpose of this land. He filled America with pride and made the nation young again.\" Critics generally liked the finished building, but the architect himself was unsatisfied. The years of conflict and compromise had changed the nature of the design, and Pei felt that the final result lacked its original passion. \"I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy,\" he said in 2000. \"It could and should have been a great project.\" Perhaps the most important consequence of the Kennedy project for Pei was his elevation in the public's consciousness as an architect of note. Pei considered the John F. Kennedy Library \"the most important commission in my life.\""

        "content": "The islands were long known by the name Islands of the Dead to the Native Americans who lived in the Bay Area prior to the arrival of Europeans, but they are not thought to have traveled to them, either for practical reasons (the voyage and landing would be difficult and dangerous) or because of spiritual beliefs (the islands were believed to be an abode of the spirits of the dead). The first Europeans to see these islands were most probably the members of the Juan Cabrillo expedition of 1542 which sailed as far north as Point Reyes, but no source record of the Cabrillo expedition's actual sighting of these islands has survived. The first European to create a record of the islands that has survived was the English privateer and explorer Sir Francis Drake, on July 24, 1579. On that day, Drake landed on the islands to collect seal meat and bird eggs for his ship. He named them the Islands of Saint James because the day after his arrival was the feast day of St James the Great. The name of St James is now applied to only one of the rocky islets of the North Farallons. The islands were apparently first given their names of the \u201cFarallones\u201d (literally, \u201ccliffs\u201d) by Friar Antonio de la Ascencion, aboard the Spanish explorer Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno's 1603 expedition. De la Ascension wrote in his diary, \"Six leagues before reaching Punta de los Reyes (Point Reyes) is a large island, two leagues from land and three leagues northwest of this are . . . seven farallones close together.\" It is believed that probably for the next two centuries after their discovery, their rather ominous appearance, lying just off the entrance to San Francisco Bay, most likely caused the earlier mariners to prefer to skirt far to the west and offshore from the entrance to the bay, thus leading to the much later discovery of the San Francisco Bay by land over two centuries after the 1542 discovery of the islands. In 1769, the bay inlet was finally discovered soon after an overland sighting of the bay was made from what is now the Pacifica area. In the years following the discovery of the islands, during the maritime fur trade era, the islands were exploited by seal hunters, first from New England and later from Russia. The Russians maintained a sealing station in the Farallones from 1812 to 1840, taking 1,200 to 1,500 fur seals annually, though American ships had already exploited the islands. The Albatross, captained by Nathan Winship, and the O'Cain, captained by his brother Jonathan Winship, were the first American ships sent from Boston in 1809 to establish a settlement on the Columbia River. In 1810, they met with two other American ships at the Farallon Islands, the Mercury and the Isabella, and at least 30,000 seal skins were taken. By 1818, the seals diminished rapidly until only about 500 could be taken annually and within the next few years, the fur seal was extirpated from the islands. Whether the northern fur seal or the Guadalupe fur seal were the islands' native fur seal is unknown, although the northern fur seal is the species that began to recolonize the islands in 1996. On July 17, 1827,  French sea captain Auguste Duhaut-Cilly sailed by the southernmost Farallon Island and counted the \"crude dwellings of about a hundred Kodiaks stationed there by the Russians of Bodega...the Kodiaks, in their light boats, slip into San Francisco Bay by night, moving along the coast opposite the fort, and once inside this great basin, they station themselves temporarily on some of the inner islands, from where they catch the sea otter without hindrance.\" After Alta California was ceded by Mexico to the United States in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the islands' environment became linked to the growth of the city of San Francisco. Beginning in 1853, a lighthouse was constructed on SEFI. As the city grew, the seabird colonies came under severe threat as eggs were collected in the millions for San Francisco markets. The trade, which in its heyday could yield 500,000 eggs a month, was the source of conflict between the egg-collecting companies and the lighthouse keepers. This conflict turned violent in a confrontation between rival companies in 1863. The clash between two rival companies, known as the Egg War, left two men dead and marked the end of private companies on the islands, although the lighthouse keepers continued egging. From 1902 to 1913, the former U.S. Weather Bureau maintained a weather station on the southeast island, which was connected with the mainland by cable. The results of the meteorological study were later published in a book on California's climate. Temperatures during those years never exceeded  or dropped to . Years later, the National Weather Service provided some weather observations from the lighthouse on its local radio station. The islands have also been mentioned in connection with the schooner Malahat as one possible site for Rum Row during Prohibition. A high-frequency direction finding (HFDF) station was established here by the Navy during World War II. These radio intercept sites along the coast could track Japanese warships and merchant marine vessels as far away as the Western Pacific.  The other stations  in California were at Point Arguello, Point Saint George, and San Diego. Bainbridge Island, Washington also hosted a station. The United States Coast Guard maintained a staffed lighthouse until 1972, when it was automated."

Most of the dumping took place before 1960, and all dumping of radioactive wastes by the United States was terminated in 1970. By then, 47,500 containers (55-gallon steel drums) had been dumped in the vicinity, with a total estimated radioactive activity of 14,500 Ci. The materials dumped were mostly laboratory materials containing traces of contamination. By 1980, most of the radiation had decayed. Waste containers were shipped to Hunters Point Shipyard, then loaded onto barges for transportation to the Farallones. Containers were weighted with concrete. Those that floated were sometimes shot with rifles to sink them. Forty-four thousand containers were dumped at , and another 3,500 at . In January 1951, the highly radioactive hull of USS Independence, which was used in Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons testing and then loaded with barrels of radioactive waste, was scuttled in the area. Its wreck was rediscovered in 2015. The exact current location of the containers and the potential hazard the containers pose to the environment are unknown.

This was expanded to the other islands in 1969 when it became a national wildlife refuge. In 1981, Congress designated the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, which spanned 1,279 square miles (3,313 square kilometers; 966 square nautical miles) of water surrounding the islands. This sanctuary protected open ocean, nearshore tidal flats, rocky intertidal areas, estuarine wetlands, subtidal reefs, and coastal beaches within its boundaries. In 2015, the sanctuary was enlarged north and west of the original boundary, partially surrounding Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary, to encompass 3,295 square miles (8,534 square kilometers; 2,488 square nautical miles), and the name was changed to Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. The sanctuary is contiguous with both the Cordell Bank sanctuary and another sanctuary to the south, Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The islands are managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in conjunction with the Marin-based Point Blue Conservation Science (formerly Point Reyes Bird Observatory). The islands are currently the subject of long term ecological research. The Farallones are closed to the public, although birders and wildlife enthusiasts can approach them on whale watching boats and the sail-training vessel Seaward out of Sausalito."

The islands' position in the highly productive California Current and eastern Pacific upwelling region, as well as the absence of other large islands that would provide suitable nesting grounds, result in a seabird population of over 250,000. Twelve species of seabird and shorebird nest on the islands; western gull, Brandt's cormorant, pelagic cormorant, double-crested cormorant, pigeon guillemot, common murre, Cassin's auklet, tufted puffin, black oystercatcher, rhinoceros auklet, ashy storm-petrel, and Leach's storm-petrel. Since the islands were protected, common murres, which once numbered nearly 500,000 pairs but suffered from the egg collecting, oil spills and other disturbances that had greatly reduced their numbers, recovered and climbed from 6,000 birds to 160,000. Additionally, since protection, the locally extinct rhinoceros auklet has begun to breed on the islands again. The island has the world's largest colonies of western gulls and ashy storm petrels, the latter species being considered endangered and a conservation priority. The island also is the wintering ground of several species of migrants, and regularly attracts vagrant birds (about 430 species of bird have been recorded on or around the island)."

These are the northern elephant seal, harbor seal, Steller's sea lion, California sea lion, and the northern fur seal (the last of which, like the rhinoceros auklet, began to return to the island again after protection). Sealers took 150,000 northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) from the Farallons between 1810 and 1813, followed by Russian fur hunters who lived on the Farallons and extirpated the pinnipeds from the islands. In 1996 West End Island became the fourth American northern fur seal rookery when a pup was born. The recolonizers bore tags from San Miguel Island in the Channel Islands, which had been itself recolonized in 1968. By 2006, nearly 100 pups were born. The fur seals are aggressive and have displaced larger sea lions from their territory. The high count for 2011 was 476 individuals, a 69 percent increase from the year before. By 2016, the pup count alone was 1,126, reflecting a 21% average (but highly variable) annual increase in new pups over the 21 years since recolonization. If the South Farallon Islands population reaches its estimated historical size of 100,000 individuals, it could account for approximately one-fifth of the world's northern fur seal population. Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) recolonized the refuge in 1959 with a confirmed pup in 1972. The elephant seal rookery on Southeast Farallon has probably reached carrying capacity."

During the next fifteen years, more than one hundred attacks on seals and sea lions were observed at close range. By the year 2000, biologists were logging almost eighty attacks in a single season. While the males return annually, the females return only every other year, often with fresh, deep bites around their heads. The seasonal shark population at the Farallones is unclear, with estimates from thirty to one hundred. The Farallones are unique in the size of the great whites that are attracted. The average length of a full-grown great white shark is , with a weight of , females generally being larger than males. Farallon great whites range between the \"smaller\" males at  to the females, which generally range between . (For comparison, the largest accurately measured great white shark was a female caught in August 1988 at Prince Edward Island off the North Atlantic coast and measured .) A killer whale was recorded killing a great white near the Farallones in 1997. Over the decades of study, many of the individual white sharks visiting the Farallones have been nicknamed, often based on their scars and appearances, such as Gouge, The Hunchback, The Jester, and Stumpy. Stumpy, an 18-foot female great white, in particular was well known for her appearance in the BBC documentary \"Great White Shark\" narrated by David Attenborough and stock footage of her attacks on decoys is often utilized in more recent documentaries, and another example, Tom Johnson, a 16-foot male white shark that was featured in an episode of the 2012 season of Shark Week called \"Great White Highway\" is believed to be the oldest living white shark so far documented returning to the Farallones, estimated at around 25\u201330 years old. Some individual sharks have been tagged and found to roam the Pacific as far as Hawaii and Guadalupe Island off Baja California, returning regularly to the Farallones every year in the autumn. Satellite tracking has revealed the majority of great white sharks from the Farallones (and from other parts of California, Hawaii and the west coast of Mexico) migrate to an area of ocean dubbed the White Shark Caf\u00e9,  west of Ensenada, Baja California. The peak of activity at this location is from mid-April to Mid-July, but some shark spend up to eight months of the year there. This island has many migratory sharks return to its waters every year."

The freeway was built to Bolton where it abruptly ends at the intersection with US-6 and US-44.  A  segment from Columbia to Windham was also built, forming the present-day US 6 bypass around Willimantic, and would have connected to the Connecticut Turnpike at what is now I-395 exit 35, following the last few miles of the Turnpike into Rhode Island. Crossing into Rhode Island, the proposed I-84 freeway was to parallel US-6 to I-295, where it would have tied into the existing US-6/RI-10 freeway. In 1982, Rhode Island canceled their plans because of community backlash and possible impacts to the Scituate Reservoir. In 1986, Connecticut canceled their plans and changed I-86 back to I-84 and I-84 was renumbered I-384.

The corresponding stretch of US-6 is known as \"Suicide 6\" because of sharp turns and intersections had been the site of numerous fatal accidents, and was the main reason supporting construction of the bypass.  It is unlikely the 11-mile freeway between I-384 and the Windham Bypass will ever be built because of irresolvable disagreements over the routing of the freeway:  State and local officials prefer more northerly alignment that minimizes disruption to developed areas along US-6, while federal officials insist on a more southerly alignment that minimizes environmental impacts to the Hop River ecosystem.  After studying more than 200 potential alignments with no agreement among stakeholders, the Connecticut Department of Transportation abandoned further study of the US-6 freeway in 2005, and instead focused on completing safety upgrades on the existing US-6 corridor between Bolton and Willimantic to reduce congestion and accidents.

        "content": "The history of Edge\u00f8ya's discovery has been a matter of dispute. Thomas Edge, writing in 1622, claimed the island was discovered by one of his ships in 1616. However, Joris Carolus, in a map published in 1614 and allegedly based on discoveries made by him the same year, shows what appears to be Edge\u00f8ya's south coast. Carolus showed the coastline split into two parts: \"Onbekende Cust\" (meaning \"Unknown Coast\" in Dutch) in the west, and \"Morfyn\" in the east. Islands are shown offshore of Morfyn. Martin Conway argued in 1901 that Carolus' chart indicated he discovered Edge\u00f8ya, but, as Wielder points out, Conway was ignorant of a map (engraved in 1612) by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius, which illustrated a coastline to the east of Spitsbergen. The coastline, indented, with islands offshore, was labelled \"Gerrits Eylant\". Wielder believed this to be the first record of Edge\u00f8ya's south coast. Schilder, an expert on Dutch cartography, said Carolus merely copied both coastlines from earlier charts, while he believed that Plancius had copied some names from a chart by Mouris Willemsz, unknown to Wielder, that was published in 1608 or earlier by Cornelis Claeszoon (British Library, London). Willemsz's chart, which Schilder says shows Edge\u00f8ya labeled as \"Groen Landt\", doesn't show Edge\u00f8ya at all, but only shows a single coastline (not two) that is supposed to represent Spitsbergen. In fact, what appears to be Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya is shown to the southeast of Spitsbergen. Plancius had thus only created a duplicate Spitsbergen. Carolus, as well, made a duplicate Spitsbergen, as his Morfyn has an uncanny resemblance to Willemsz's Groen Landt. This would indicate that the island would not have been discovered until 1616, as claimed by Edge. A 1617 letter written between the English whalers proves that Europeans had discovered the island at least at that late of date, or earlier, as Edge claims. Four Russian sailors were marooned on Edge\u00f8ya, or a small island off the coast of Edge\u00f8ya, from 1743 until September 1749. Three survived to tell an epic tale of survival. Author David Roberts wrote a book about his research on this story, Four Against The Arctic. He concluded, although not definitively, that the men were probably on a small island to the southeast of Edge\u00f8ya called Halvm\u00e5ne\u00f8ya, or Half Moon Island. While no major settlement grew upon Edge\u00f8ya, whaling and walrus hunting were extensive industries in the area. Remains of these can be found offshore of Edge\u00f8ya, on B\u00f6lsche\u00f8ya in the Thousand Islands group."

Due to difficulties in installing platform screen doors (PSDs) in above ground stations, the MTR decided not to install PSDs in this station, instead installing automatic platform gates (APGs) on the station's platforms in 2011. In 2011, the MTR also changed the hue of Kowloon Bay station from black to red. The headquarters of the MTR Corporation and the depot for the Kwun Tong line are both located at this station.

In the fall semester, the freshmen enroll in three, six-week introductory technology courses chosen from the school's six technology departments. After their first semester of study, freshman students will select a technology major. They will remain in that major for the duration of their ninth-grade year and for the proceeding three years.

Therefore, since the school's birth in 1955, the \"Bosco Tech Royal Techmen Marching Band\" became the school's first and oldest extracurricular activity. Bosco Tech's music program was founded in 1957. Its most famous band director was Brother Eugene Burns, who directed the band from 1957 to 1978. In the 1970-1971 season, the auxiliary units were formed by San Gabriel Mission only until 1980s, when girls from Ramona Convent joined the units. The band had marched 70+ members in the 1970s, but, in recent years, band membership has averaged 35\u201340 members. Despite its relatively small size, the marching band and the auxiliary units have scored high points in their division and have even received sweepstakes. The marching band is known throughout the state as \"the band with the cannon\". Its trademark cannon, made on the school premises, was fired and pulled by two students in front of the band during band reviews and parades in various Southern California cities, such as Arcadia, Temple City, Long Beach, Montebello, Azusa and San Francisco. The band has also appeared in the Los Angeles County Fair, a University of Southern California football game, the California 500 Speedway in Ontario, Disneyland's \"America on Parade\", Dodger Stadium, San Francisco's Columbus Day Parade, the Hawaii Invitational Music Festival, the Kennedy Space Center, Sea World San Diego and Universal Studios Florida. During the Winter of the 2017-18 school year, the band's membership grew to 48 members. During this time there were more students involved in the band than the football team. The next year, in the 2018-19 school year, the band opened its registration to its sister schools:San Gabriel Mission and Ramona Convent, as those schools did not have proper music programs. For the first time in 61 years, the Bosco Tech Music Program features players of both genders."

The mountains reach a height of 2469 metres in the Jotunheimen mountain range, the highest point in the Nordic countries (excluding Greenland). Other prominent mountain ranges include part of the Dovrefjell in the far north of the region, the Rondane north east of Lillehammer and others. The high plateau of Hardangervidda extends into Western Norway. Valleys cut deep into the mountains, from east to west the main valleys are \u00d8sterdal, Gudbrandsdal, Valdres, Hallingdal, Numedal and the many valleys of Telemark. \u00d8sterdalen is surrounded by mostly flat areas of conifer forests, but the others are all deeply cut into the mountains. Most of eastern Norway's southern half is dominated of rolling hills with pine and spruce forests, and agricultural land down in the valleys The area around the Oslo fjord and towards the north east are comparatively flat, and there are patches of intensely cultivated lands, notably Hedmarken, Toten, Hadeland, Ringerike and others. The population density in the flatlands is the highest in the nation, and some 40% of the nation's population lives within 200\u00a0km of Oslo.

The dialects of the interior mountainous areas (Hedmark, Oppland, and interior parts of Buskerud and Telemark) are all distinct.  The dialects of the coastal areas (Telemark, Vestfold, Akershus, southern Buskerud, Oslo and \u00d8stfold) are more similar to the written language (Bokm\u00e5l); in fact, Urban East Norwegian can be said to be an unofficial standard pronunciation of Bokm\u00e5l. The eastern forests of Finnskogen were the home of a Finnish minority, that immigrated in the area in the 17th century. Their language and culture was preserved into the 20th century, but now only folk tunes and food specialities remain. The southernmost group of Norway's Sami population is to be found in the north-eastern corner, in Engerdal. The culture of mountain valleys is preserved to a greater degree than the more urbanized metropolitan areas.  The area is distinguished with traditional architecture, like stave churches and lafteverk, folk music and food.  Some are concerned for the loss of local culture in the face of modernization. There are many tourist traps, which have a tendency of becoming Disneyland versions of the actual culture, especially in the ski resorts, which are transformed by people from the cities, with increased building of shops, hotels and vacation houses. It is common to see moose warning signs missing from their posts, because of many tourists taking them home as a souvenir. This is of course illegal, and can result in a fine. The coastal region is densely populated both by Norwegian and European standards. This region was the early industrialized.  Traditionally the biggest export was timber and shipping, now employment in the industrial sector is in decline and most people are working in service-oriented companies. The coastal area is varied, from the metropolitan Oslo to the more quiet and idyllic old maritime city of Dr\u00f8bak, and the oldest city in Norway, T\u00f8nsberg There is also some museum railway lines, for example the Kr\u00f8der Line, where one can ride heritage steam and diesel trains on old twisty railway tracks. Oslo, the capital of Norway, has attracted people from all over Norway. Most of the immigrants settle here as well. There are numerous mosques, Hindu shrines, Sikh temples, Buddhist temples, as well as many churches, giving Oslo a cosmopolitan feel."

Barwon derives from the Wathaurong word Barrwang or Baarwon meaning magpie. The river and upstream lakes (Lake Connewarre and Reedy Lake) were frequented by Aboriginal hunters and fishermen, including the escaped convict, William Buckley, who lived with the Wathaurong for 32 years. When European settlers arrived in Port Phillip in June 1835, a camp was established at Indented Head. Port Phillip Association surveyor, John Helder Wedge, explored the Bellarine Peninsula, including the Barwon and its lakes, in August 1835. It is unknown when colonists first took up land at Barwon Heads but, by the 1870s, a township was formed, with a Post Office opening in the area on 15 December 1889 (renamed Connewarre East in 1890 when a new Barwon Heads PO opened in the township). Fishing was the mainstay of the town in its early years. In the 1920s and 1930s, the town became a popular holiday resort, and a number of the wealthier families of Melbourne and the Western District built houses here. The summer period still sees a large influx of holidaymakers to the town. In 1959, the closing scenes of the film On the Beach, based on a Nevil Shute novel about the end of the world, were filmed in the town. The Barwon Heads Golf Club clubhouse, located on Golf Links Road and dating from 1923\u201324, is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. The former Barwon Heads Bridge was also listed on the Register, but it was demolished in 2009 after being declared irreparable. A new bridge was constructed, which used components and design elements of the original bridge. A separate footbridge was built parallel to it."

A proposal was put forward to align a new bridge with Geelong Road, permitting traffic to bypass the main shopping precinct and primary school, but with the consequence of removing three homes. An independent panel was appointed by the then Minister for Planning, Rob Hulls, to decide on a bridge location. Evidence was presented for and against the Geelong Road site and the existing site, with the conclusion that the Geelong Road alignment was unsuitable for environmental, social, economic reasons. On 16 March 2007, it was announced that the current bridge would be improved and there were no plans to build a second bridge upstream. In 2010, a new Barwon Heads road bridge was constructed on the alignment of the existing one, making use of its components and design elements. A parallel pedestrian bridge was also built."

Since the SeaChange television series first aired in 1998 there has been a significant increase in tourism and real estate sales and development (both commercial and residential) in the area. This has resulted in a very substantial increase in property and land values, making the town an ideal location for property developers. Since then, the area has experienced a boom in tourist numbers during the summer months. Nearby Thirteenth Beach is a popular surfing location, the beach is named for its proximity to the 13th hole of the golf course.

Situated 7.9 miles south of downtown Boston, it is home to a diverse range of people, housing types and social groups. It is an urban location with suburban characteristics. Hyde Park is covered by Boston Police Department District E-18 located in Cleary Square, and the Boston Fire Department station on Fairmount Avenue is the quarters of Ladder Company 28 & Engine Company 48. Boston EMS Ambulance Station 18 is located on Dana Avenue. Hyde Park also has a branch of the Boston Public Library. The George Wright Golf Course, named for Baseball Hall of Fame and Boston Red Stockings shortstop George Wright, is in Hyde Park and Roslindale. It is a Donald Ross-designed course and is considered one of his finest designs. Hyde Park has taken the motto \"A Small Town in the City\" because of its suburban feel. It was the only town annexed by majority vote of the residents into the City of Boston. The area was established in the 1660s and grew into a hub of paper and cotton manufacturing in the eighteenth century. The extension of rail lines from Boston in the 1850s spurred the area's residential development. The Readville section of Hyde Park contained a large manufacturing base housing the massive operations of the B. F. Sturtevant Company and the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Locomotive and Car Shops. Hyde Park and some of its residents have been important part of societal change in the United States. It was once home to the first all African-American army unit, the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. The regiment was made famous in the movie Glory. Hyde Park was home to the prominent abolitionists the Grimk\u00e9 sisters, Sarah and Angelina, as well as Theodore Dwight Weld, for whom Weld Hall in Hyde Park is named."

        "content": "In 1845, retired businessman Henry Grew took his family on vacation to an area south of the City of Boston, in what was then the western section of Dorchester, and came to a spot in the Neponset River valley with an unexpectedly pleasant view of the nearby Blue Hills.  He purchased several hundred acres of land there (which later became known as \"Grew's Woods\", partially preserved today as the Stony Brook Reservation and the George Wright Golf Course) and moved to the area in 1847. (Grew later served as chairman of the new Town of Hyde Park's first Board of Selectmen and was one of its most prominent citizens.)  During the next few years, a group called the Hyde Park Land Company bought about 200 acres of land in the area and began building houses around a small and unofficial passenger stop on the Boston and Providence Railroad that had developed at Kenny's Bridge, located on the road from Dedham to Milton Lower Mills (the road was River Street, and the station today is Hyde Park Station). At that time, the closest actual station was in the manufacturing district of Readville (formerly Low Plains) in Dedham. Alpheus Perley Blake is considered the founder of Hyde Park. He was the organizer in 1856 of the Fairmount Land Company and the Twenty Associates, which developed the Fairmount Hill on the western side of Brush Hill Road in Milton. This led to the establishment of a bridge over the Neponset River and a new station on the New York and New England Railroad, which is today's Fairmount Station.  In addition to Blake, The Twenty Associates included William E. Abbot, Amos Angell, Ira L. Benton, Enoch Blake, John Newton Brown, George W. Currier, Hypolitus Fisk, John C. French, David Higgins, John S. Hobbs, Samuel Salmon Mooney, William Nightingale, J. Wentworth Payson, Dwight B. Rich, Alphonso Robinson, William H. Seavey, Daniel Warren, and John Williams.  Within a few years, the two land companies had merged and growth in the area accelerated.  By 1867, the settlements had grown to the point where there were 6 railroad stations in the area. A formal petition was made to the General Court of the Commonwealth and, after settling land and boundary disputes with Dedham and Milton, the Town of Hyde Park was incorporated on April 22, 1868 in Norfolk County from the settled land in Dorchester (Grew's Woods and the Hyde Park Land Company development), Milton (Fairmount) and Dedham (Readville).  It remained a part of Norfolk County until 1912, when the town voted in favor of annexation to the City of Boston in Suffolk County. The 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, one of the first official African-American units in the United States Army and which was commanded by Col. Robert G. Shaw and served during the Civil War, was assembled and trained at Camp Meigs in Readville. In the 1960s, Hyde Park threatened to secede from Boston over plans to build a Southwest Expressway (Interstate 95) through the town along the route of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, which would bifurcate the neighborhood and displace many residents, as had happened in Roxbury and Jamaica Plain.  Hyde Park has also faced other challenges along with its fellow Boston neighborhoods, such as the busing crisis of the 1970s. Hyde Park has had an active industrial history.  For over 100 years, it was the main base of the Westinghouse Sturtevant Corporation.  The Readville area was home to the Stop & Shop warehouse, until it was moved to Assonet in the early 2000s. Hyde Park is home to many churches, most notably the Most Precious Blood, Saint Adalbert's and Saint Anne's Roman Catholic churches, and the Episcopal Parish of Christ Church (the oldest parish in Hyde Park, now Iglesia de San Juan), the latter of which was designed by the architectural form of Cram Wentworth & Goodhue and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hyde Park is also the original home of the Boston Crusaders, a world class drum and bugle corps founded in 1940 at the Most Precious Blood Parish."

They played important public roles throughout their lives in ending slavery and promoting women's suffrage. In the 1970s, desegregation busing of the Boston Public Schools caused an explosion in public activism. Public meetings and protests from concerned parents of affected children continued for years. The issue united Hyde Park with surrounding areas in an attempt to form a new school district for the purpose of avoiding desegregation. Public tension over busing lasted for more than a decade. Hyde Park is home to a large Haitian community that arrived from the island during the 1980s and on into the 1990s. Immigrants from rural areas of Haiti had limited education beyond early elementary school years. As a result of a Federal lawsuit by parents from Hyde Park and other areas of the city, Boston Public Schools were mandated to provide a comprehensive literacy program. The Haitian Literacy Program has been housed at Hyde Park High School since 1989. Hyde Park is currently under a major redevelopment effort by the Boston Redevelopment Authority. The Hyde Park Neighborhood Strategic Plan was adopted by BRA. As of yet, the plan has not met notable public resistance. Its aim is to change the zoning regulations in Hyde Park, with an emphasis on public transit and pedestrian use. Though, there is currently a proposal by non Hyde Park residents to create an urban farm that is receiving public resistance."

        "content": "By the time Hyde Park was incorporated into the City of Boston, B.F. Sturtevant Co had a 20-acre industrial park in the Readville area. It became one of the largest fan manufacturing plants in the world. The plant employed 1,500 people in Hyde Park. In the early part of the 20th century, Hyde Park hosted harness racing. The site of the track was redeveloped on the former site of Camp Miegs. The Readville Trotting Park was neighbored by the large B.F.Sturtevant plant, thus prompting the installation of a railway station. The track migrated from horses to auto racing, which was the main attraction at the track until its closure in 1937. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works attempted to implement two separate interstate highway expansion projects. Both plans would have created a highway that would have passed through land in Hyde Park. The projects were started but, because of public opposition, were never finished. Interstate 695 and the Southwest Corridor would have run right though Hyde Park, effectively cutting it in half. Hyde Park residents considered seceding from the City of Boston. Residents from Hyde Park and other surrounding communities affected by the proposed project banded together and held a large protest on Boston Common, during what was called \"People Before Highways Day\". This rally proved to be crucial in having the plan stopped. Because of the presence of the Stony Brook Reservation, a large part of Hyde Park's interior is effectively off-limits to any new development. The Stony Brook Reservation is a part of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. In April 2008, the Boston Redevelopment Authority Board, along with Mayor Menino, voted to remap and rezone Hyde Park. Mayor Menino appointed an advisory group of 13 residents to assist the BRA in creating a comprehensive rezoning plan. After two years, with input from city agencies and the community at large, BRA adopted the Hyde Park Neighborhood Strategic Plan. BRA then went on to hire a team of consultants from the urban architecture and design firm of Crosby Schlessinger Smallridge. Articles and a new zoning map were prepared and presented to the Boston Redevelopment Authority Board, which accepted it. The Boston Zoning Commission subsequently agreed to the plan in February 2012."

The rock outcrop, composed mostly of rhyodacite, is a volcanic plug formed when magma welled up underneath a layer of softer rock and solidified. The softer overlying rock has since eroded away, leaving a distinct, rugged shape. On its east face is a rock formation named Tiki Rock, because of its resemblance to a Polynesian Tiki carving."

        "content": "The 16th-century Dutch Revolt against the Habsburgs created a new country with a new religion. Soon, the need for a seat of higher learning was felt and in 1575 Leiden University was founded with the spoils from a confiscated Catholic monastery nearby. At the time the university was founded, it was immediately determined that a library in the vicinity of lecture halls was an absolute necessity. The library's first book was the Polyglot Bible, printed by Christoffel Plantijn, a gift of William of Orange to the library in 1575.  The presentation of this book is regarded as the base on which the library is built (fundamentum locans futurae aliquando bibliothecae). The library became operational in the vault of the current Academy building at Rapenburg on 31 October 1587. In 1595 the Nomenclator appeared, the first catalogue of Leiden University Libraries as well as the first printed catalogue of an institutional library in the world.  The publication of the catalogue coincided with the opening of the new library on the upper floor of the Faliede Bagijnkerk (now Rapenburg 70) next to the Theatrum Anatomicum. In 1864 the copy for the complete alphabetical catalogue of the library in Leiden from 1575 to 1860 was finished; it was never to appear in print.  Readers were able to consult alphabetical and systematic registers of the Leiden library in the form of bound catalogue cards, known as Leidse boekjes.  This remained the cataloguing system for the library until 1988. The 22nd Librarian of Leiden University, Johan Remmes de Groot took the initiative for the Dutch library automation endeavor PICA (Project Integrated Catalogue Automation).  Pica was started up in 1969 and was bought by OCLC in 2000.  The first automation project in Leiden started in 1976, produced 400,000 titles via the Dutch PICA-GGC and resulted within a few years in a catalog on microfiche, which partly replaced the famous Leiden booklets catalogue. In 1983 the library moved to its present location on Witte Singel in a new building by architect Bart van Kasteel.  The first online catalogue became available in 1988. According to Nicholas A. Basbanes, Leiden University Libraries represent \"an essential benchmark [...] not only for the teeming collection of extraordinary materials it has scrupulously gathered and maintained over a sustained period of time, but most of all for being the world's first scholarly library in a truly modern sense.  The litany of 'firsts' recorded at Leiden is dazzling - the first printed catalogue to be prepared by an institution of its holdings, the first attempt to identify and maintain what today are known as 'special collections,' the first systematic attempt to develop a corps of influential friends, patrons, and benefactors throughout the world, the first 'universal' library, the list goes on and on - and underpinning it all is a humanistic approach to education and discovery that has figured prominently throughout its history, along with an unbending belief in the limitless potential of human inquiry.\""

Since June 1, 2009, the Leiden libraries form one organization: Leiden University Libraries (UBL). Leiden University Libraries has a number of locations: the University Library, the libraries of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Law, Mathematics and Natural Sciences and the East Asian Library. The collections of the former Archeology, Art History and Kern libraries are available at the University Library. On September 3, 2012, a Library Learning Centre was opened on the university's The Hague campus. Leiden University Libraries took over in 2013 the colonial collections including the entire map collections (colonial and modern) of the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) and in 2014 the complete collection of the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (KITLV). By bringing these collections together with those of the university libraries, the largest Indonesian and Caribbean collections worldwide were created. Furthermore, Leiden University Libraries took over the KITLV-Jakarta office where extensive paper and digital collections on modern Indonesia are collected and cataloged. To house its world-famous and vast Asian collections a number of new facilities have been created: an open stack area making 5\u00a0km of materials directly available and a new remote storage facility housing 38\u00a0km of library materials. On 14 September 2017, H.M. Queen M\u00e1xima opened The Asian Library, a new floor on top of the University Library. In 2017, the Academic Historical Museum became part of UBL. The library of The Netherlands Institute for the Near East, specialised in the fields of Assyriology, Egyptology and  Near Eastern Archaeology, became part of UBL in 2018. Leiden University Libraries works together with other organizations nationally and internationally on innovation projects in this area. The library e.g. participated in the DAREnet  project and in projects financed by the European Union such as DRIVER-II  and OAPEN."

        "content": "From its very onset the study of the Orient was of vital importance to the new university. Theologians studied the Semitic languages to perceive the meaning of the Bible. Political and commercial interests prompted the new-born Dutch Republic to establish relations with its enemies' enemies, among whom the Ottoman Empire, then at the zenith of its power. In the course of its expansionist policy the Dutch Republic secured possession of the Indonesian archipelago and other territories in South East Asia. In Japan, Dutch merchants maintained a trading post to the exclusion of all other European powers. In the course of four centuries countless manuscripts, printed books and photographs on the Orient and Oriental Studies have found their way to the library of Leiden University. Oriental Studies are still flourishing at Leiden University, and the Oriental Collections are still growing to serve the needs of the national and international scholarly community. The Oriental Collections of Leiden University Libraries are known as the Legatum Warnerianum (Warner's Legacy), referring to Levinus Warner (1619\u20131665), envoy to the Sublime Porte at Constantinople, whose collection of 1,000 Middle Eastern manuscripts forms the core of the present-day Oriental Collections. In 1659 following the death of the Ottoman bibliophile-encyclopedist K\u00e2tip \u00c7elebi his library was sold. At the time it was the largest private library in Istanbul, and Warner acquired part of it for the University of Leiden. The Oriental Collections nowadays contain 30,000 manuscripts and 200,000 printed books on subjects ranging from Archaeology to Zoroastrianism and in languages from Arabic to Zulu."

        "content": "The Bibliotheca Thysiana was erected in 1655 to house the book collection of the lawyer Joannes Thysius (1622\u20131653). Upon his early death, he left a legacy of 20,000 guilders for the building of a public library (\"tot publycque dienst der studie\") with a custodian's dwelling. Designed by the architect Arent van 's-Gravensande, the building follows the Dutch Classical style and is regarded as one of the jewels of Dutch 17th century architecture. It is distinguished by its balanced proportions and the purity of its Ionic order on top of a high basement. The Bibliotheca Thysiana is the only surviving 17th century example in the Netherlands of a building that was designed as a library.  It is quite extraordinary that a complete private 17th century library has been preserved and thus offers a good impression of the book collection of a young, learned bibliophile from the period of late Humanism.  The collection contains about 2,500 books and thousands of pamphlets in all scientific fields."

The society had regular meetings in Leiden on literary subjects, but also on scientific subjects. It became fashionable for the elite to become members, and many were also members of the Dutch Society of Science (Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen), a similar society for the study of scientific subjects founded in Haarlem in 1752. Both societies still hold contests and award prizes for achievement."

Amongst the drawings and prints you will find works by famous Dutch artists like Goltzius, Visscher, Rembrandt, Troost, Maris, Toorop, and Veldhoen, but prominent artists from other European Schools, like Hogarth, Callot, Canaletto, and D\u00fcrer are also present with specimens up to 1900.  The photography collection spreads from its earliest history to the present day and boasts examples of virtually every Dutch photographer, from anonymous nineteenth-century pioneers through Piet Zwart and Paul Citroen to Ed van der Elsken and Johan van der Keuken, including a lot of attention to present day photographers such as Erwin Olaf and Hendrik Kerstens."

In 1913 the collection was taken over by the Colonial Institute in Amsterdam founded in 1910.  In 1950, after the Dutch decolonization, the mission of the Colonial Institute changed which was reflected in a name change to Royal Tropical Institute. But also the development of the collection changed quite drastically.  In 2013 the Library of the Royal Tropical Institute was closed and the part of the collection that dealt with the former Dutch colonies was housed at Leiden University Libraries. Collection of the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (KITLV) The KITLV was founded in 1851 and created the foremost collections on Southeast Asia (especially on Indonesia) and the Caribbean (especially Suriname, Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles). The collection contains about 1 million  - mostly postcolonial - books and special collections, including 150.000 digitized historical photographs, maps, prints and unique archives.

The first stone bridge was completed between 1808 and 1811 as part of works led by Thomas Telford. The bridge was extensively damaged by flooding in 1818. It was later widened in 1933 to accommodate the expanded A82 road. Historically the village was within the local government county of Inverness (until 1975) and the Inverness district of the Highland local government region (from 1975 to 1996). The Drumnadrochit Hotel is a Category B listed three-storey hotel completed in 1882. The former Caledonian Bank building is also a prominent structure in the village and was constructed in 1895, although it is no longer a bank. A small strip of the estate's land still exists to this day, mostly north of the small settlement of Balbeg that lies north of Balnain. It is largely publicly accessible and is mostly used for grazing cattle in the summer. Established after the First World War, the Glen Urquhart war memorial is located in Drumnadrochit and is in the shape of a column, with a small ceremonial fenced garden. In 2006, the village hall, originally funded by Bradley Martin of Balmacaan House, celebrated its centenary."

The estate then changed hands so frequently that the issue was raised in parliament. The best forestry wood had been felled during World War 2 and the estate was dissolved in 1946. Balmacaan House, near Drumnadrochit, was abandoned soon afterwards. In 1946, Bunloit Farm was separated from Balmacaan Estate and Bunloit Estate was formed round it near the small settlement of Balbeg, located on the north west shore of Loch Ness, about 4 miles south of Drumnadrochit."

        "content": "The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1322, but the church was not new that year. The first church at Hopperstad was likely a small, wooden stave church that was built during the mid-11th century, possibly around the year 1060. This church was torn down and replaced with the present church during the early- to mid-12th century, possibly between the years 1130 and 1150. In 1982, archaeological evidence was found showing post holes for the large staves that support the idea of a previous church on the site. Again in 1997, a series of samples from the logs were collected for dendrochronological dating of the church. A total of seven samples produced an estimate for the construction ranging from 1034 to 1116 and resulted in no definite conclusion in the age of the church, however, this supports the idea that the materials from the old church were used in the construction of the present church. No records exist as to what the medieval church actually looked like. There are a variety of sketches showing a nave and chancel. The church did not undergo any major changes until the 1600s. At that time the nave was lengthened to the west, and a bell-tower was added above the new extension. To the east, a new section was added and built out of logs. A new vestibule to the south with its own entrance was also added. In 1723, the church was sold into private ownership at the Norwegian church auction so the King could pay off debts from the Great Northern War. The largest addition to the church came to the north with a log construction. This new part was named the \"new church\" (). The construction was finished during the 1700s (this area was torn down in around 1875). There are no known images of the interior from this time, but a story written by the priest Niels Dahl, who is assumed to have visited the church in 1824, describes the interior: In 1814, this church served as an election church (). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway's first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called \"electors\" who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet in Eidsvoll later that year. In the 1870s, the two neighboring Hove Church and Hopperstad Stave Church parishes were both in need of new churches. The issue was first raised by the local parish priest J\u00f8rgen Christian Andreas Gr\u00f8ner who complained about the size of the two churches. Both churches were old and small and due to their age, they were in dire need of improvements. The local villagers believed he was exaggerating and the private owners of the church did not want to spend money on the churches. Soon after, the local priest decided to no longer hold services at the Hopperstad Stave Church since it was so cold and drafty. Within a short period of time, it was decided to merge the two neighboring parishes into one larger parish. On 11 December 1875, a royal decree was issued that ordered the closure of both churches and the construction of a new church in Vik\u00f8yri for the newly created parish. In 1877, the new Vik Church was constructed and the two older churches were taken out of regular use and preserved as historical sites. In 1877, after about 700 years in use, the old church was abandoned. The church had been in very poor condition for many years and three years after its closure, the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments purchased the building in 1880. All of the \"new\" additions were torn down, leaving just the medieval building still standing. Using the Borgund Stave Church as a model, architect Peter Andreas Blix reconstructed the church between 1884 and 1891. During the reconstruction, carved sections were found beneath the floor which indicated that the new church replaced an older church, which was probably built in the latter half of the 11th century. During the reconstruction, the nave and choir were left alone and the apse, corridors, and roof were all rebuilt. All of the newly rebuilt areas were based on similar existing stave churches such as the Borgund Stave Church and the Urnes Stave Church. Since its completion in 1891, the church has been used primarily as a museum, although the parish will still use the church for special occasions."

The lobby at the arena's southeast entrance is named after Shehadey\u2019s late wife, Elayne Shehadey. The majority of the funding for the facility came from two sources. Save Mart Supermarkets paid US$40 million for 20 years naming rights, and the Pepsi Bottling Group paid a similar sum for exclusive, indefinite beverage dispensing rights. Total construction costs exceeded US$100 million and when completed, represented the largest privately funded complex of any university in the United States. The Bulldog Foundation donated money for the following amenities at Save Mart Center: The Bulldog Foundation Community Room, which displays the names of past presidents, current officers, lifetime honorees and annual top fund raisers,  is used for show catering, premium seating holder dining, and is also available for rent. The Bronze Bulldog at the Shehadey Lobby. Created by the Visalia-based art foundry, EMI, the massive bronze bulldog statue has dimensions of 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) high, 2\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft) wide, 3\u00a0m (9\u00a0ft) long, weighing 1,905\u00a0kg (4,200\u00a0lb). Statue onlookers will see engraved on its mounted plaque: Nine time capsule boxes were placed in the base of the massive Bulldog statue early in 2004. The contents of capsules were chosen to represent all aspects of Fresno State University, including the Bulldog Foundation, administration, alumni, students and athletics. The capsules are scheduled to be opened in early 2054. Save Mart Center's display cases, located on the upper and main concourses, exhibits equipment and memorabilia of each of the current Bulldog sport activities. Additionally, the display case in the northwest corner spotlights the academic success of Fresno State\u2019s student athletes. The Bulldog Walkway is a permanent, on-campus tribute to the California State University, Fresno alumni, graduates and friends. It is located on the north side of Save Mart Center with the first three tiles in honour of Colonel Rick Husband, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia accident, Lieutenant Commander Otis Vincent Tolbert, who died in the 911 attack on the Pentagon and United Airlines Flight 93 passenger, Todd Morgan Beamer. All were Fresno State alumni. Expected to eventually be extended throughout the campus, the walkway consists of personalized tiles and bricks intended to leave a lasting impression to those who use it. The Bulldog Shop souvenir store is located on the arena's northeast lobby. It will only be open to sell Fresno State merchandise and apparel during university events."

The name means either 'reed island' or 'island on the river Bune'. There has been a settlement on the site since pre-Norman times, perhaps as far back as the days of the Roman Empire. The parish Church of St Mary is 14th century. The most significant building in the village is Bunny Hall, probably built in the 1570s and occupied by the Parkyns family for three hundred years. Sir Thomas Parkyns, 2nd Baronet (1662\u20131741), known as the Wrestling Baronet, built what is now the north wing to his own design circa 1723\u201325. He also built the school and almshouses. Thomas Parkyns was a devotee of wrestling and organised an annual wrestling match in Bunny Park (prize a gold-laced hat). These matches continued until 1810. His book on the subject The Inn-Play: or, the Cornish Hugg-Wrestler was published in 1713 and reprinted many times. The following is an excerpt from a description of Bunny as published in 1813: Bunny, a straggling village on the high road, containing about sixty houses, and which seems to have been indebted principally for its origin to the ancient seat of Bunny Park Hall, once the property of the family of Parkyns, and now of their descendant Lord Rancliffe. This family have indeed been great benefactors factors to the village, as it contains a good school house and hospital, the former being close to the church yard gate and erected in 1700 for the poor children of Bunny and Bradmore; and the latter having four rooms for four poor widows, and endowed by Dame Anne Parkyns."

When the local area was renamed Humberside following local government re-organisation in England, the name was changed to Humberside Airport. The main runway, designated 03/21 (since redesignated 02/20) was extended to its current length in 1992, allowing operation of much larger aircraft. In 2008, MAG announced that it was conducting a review of its strategy for Humberside Airport, and all options including disposal were under consideration. Initially it announced plans to sell Humberside Airport after nine years of ownership. In December 2008, MAG announced it intended to retain Humberside Airport, due to a number of investments, such as the new \u00a31.6 million perishables hub, coupled with a surge in passenger numbers and little interest from potential bidders. MAG sold its 83.7% share of Humberside in 2012 for \u00a32.3 million to Eastern Group to focus on the larger airports in its portfolio.

CHC will commence a new contract for \u00d8rsted (formerly DONG Energy) in April 2018, supporting North Sea wind farm construction. Humberside has one of the highest NEQ approval levels of any airport in Europe, and saw significant growth in cargo throughput from 144 tonnes in 2007 to 1,132 tonnes in 2011. This was due to regular flights by Icelandair Cargo, however these ceased to operate in 2012 and cargo had reduced to 123 tonnes in 2016. Humberside International has a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P739) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction. It has an amount of general aviation activity, with five resident flying clubs and organisations offering fixed wing and rotary training. Weston Aviation opened in May 2011 a fixed based operation (FBO). This will be the first dedicated FBO at the airport, where the company has also opened a regional charter sales office, to promote and develop the use of business and private aviation in Yorkshire and the Humber."

        "content": "Construction for Southwest High School began in 1938, and the school was opened in 1940, with the main entrance at Beard Avenue South and West 47th Street. The school drew 841 students from Minneapolis, Edina and Richfield its first year. Several additions were made to the original structure. The first, a second gymnasium and several new classrooms in an area later known as the \"North\" building, opened in 1956; additionally, Southwest became a 7-12 school that same year. The second, was an entirely new building that became Southwest Junior High and was connected via a single hallway, opening in 1968; the new building containing another gymnasium, a new library, and a pool. With the new gymnasium in the \"East\" building, the gymnasium in the original structure was turned into a 700-seat auditorium. With the reorganization of Minneapolis schools in 1982, Southwest returned to just grades 9\u201312, with seventh and eighth graders going to Anwatin or Anthony Middle Schools. Most of the students who attended West High School were transferred to Southwest when it was closed the same year. In 1987, the International Baccalaureate Programme began at Southwest. Currently, all 9th and 10th grade students follow the IB Middle Years Programme curriculum. Also in 1987, Southwest High School was one of the first high schools in the country to stop using a Native American for its mascot and nickname. The Southwest student body voted to change the nickname of the school from the Indians to the Lakers. In 1998\u20131999, the classrooms in the North building were enlarged to become science laboratories. This same renovation included more new classrooms, a new gymnasium floor, and bleachers. In 2006, a new equipment and weight lifting area was designed in the vocational north end of the main building. Over the next few years, the entire interior structure of the auditorium was removed starting with the concrete floor and ending with the new roof. The original stage and part of the original gym floor, now the orchestra pit, are all that remain of the previous structure. A new audio-video control booth, catwalks, seating, and acoustic walls were added, as well. In 2016, the Minneapolis school board approved a $47+ million renovation which would add a new building and let the school have space for 450 new students. The renovation was completed for the 2016\u201317 school year and added 20 new classrooms to the school building. The new 60,346 square foot building was constructed between the original east (Southwest Junior High building) and west buildings. As a part of the renovation, 12,400 square feet of the east building was demolished. The main offices of the school were moved to the new structure, and a large part of the 60,346 square foot building was the new 10,000 square foot lunch room. The renovation also included mechanical upgrades like air conditioning that classrooms in the school had never had before. On March 14, 2018, exactly one month after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, students at Southwest participated in a nationwide walkout to honor the victims of the shooting and protest gun violence. During the walkout a student showed up waving a \"Trump\" flag and yelling racial slurs, prompting several of his fellow students to chase him down, take his flag, and assault him. The student sustained minor injuries and a camera he was holding was damaged. Minneapolis Police claimed that a school resource officer stopped the confrontation."

It began broadcasting at 99.9 FM in 1947 as CFRB-FM, a simulcast of CFRB. Rogers Radio Broadcasting eventually became known as Standard Broadcasting, which was acquired by Argus Corporation in 1948. In April 1961, the complete simulcast was dropped, in favour of some unique programming. In April 1963, the station changed its call letters to CKFM-FM. All CFRB programming was discontinued. The station adopted an easy listening and MOR format, which lasted for many years and was very successful in ratings (a 1974 Billboard magazine article claimed the station had the most listeners in the 25-to-34-year-old age group of any Canadian radio station, AM or FM). During this time period, CKFM carried a few specialty shows, including a Sunday evening reggae program. Towards the latter part of the 1980s, CKFM transitioned towards a more younger-targeting adult contemporary format."

This coincided with the return of former Kiss 92 and CHFI-FM morning show hosts Mad Dog and Billie to Toronto radio. A Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) decision from May 31, 2007, stated that the station's call sign was changed to CFMX-FM. Within weeks, the station reverted to CKFM-FM, due to both potential confusion with CFMZ-FM as that station, licensed to Cobourg but also heard in Toronto because of a rebroadcaster, was previously known as CFMX-FM; and because as of November 14, 2007, according to Industry Canada databases, the Toronto rebroadcaster of CFMZ was actually still known as CFMX-FM-1 (not CFMZ-FM-1). On October 28, 2007, CKFM was purchased by Astral Media as part of its purchase of Standard Broadcasting. Since its purchase by Astral, the hot AC format went in a more rhythmic-leaning direction, patterned after sister stations CJFM-FM in Montreal and CKZZ-FM in Vancouver, which both carried rhythmic-leaning hot AC formats. It also began airing the American Top 40, which usually airs on Top 40/CHR stations across the United States and Canada."

The final song on \"Mix\" was Green Day's \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\", while the first song on \"Virgin\" was Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\". The change came just before the original UK Virgin station was slated to lose its licence to the \"Virgin\" name and rebrand as Absolute Radio. Astral officials indicated at the time that, if the rebranding was successful, the \"Virgin\" brand would eventually be rolled out to other markets nationwide. Barely three months later, on December 4, Astral deemed the new brand a success, and announced that stations in Montreal, Ottawa, and Vancouver will be rebranded as \"Virgin\" stations effective early January 2009. All three stations will retain essentially the same formats (rock at the Ottawa station, hot AC in Montreal and Vancouver). In addition to the aforementioned three stations, the \"Virgin\" branding has since been expanded to Calgary, Edmonton, London, Winnipeg, Kitchener, Halifax, Victoria, Kelowna and Windsor. In June 2010, CKFM slightly changed its branding 99.9 Virgin Radio (pronounced, \"ninety-nine-nine Virgin Radio\"). A week after the change, the station held a contest called \"Say it & Win!\", where the 99th caller gets 10 seconds to say their new branding, \"ninety-nine-nine Virgin Radio\" for as many times as they can. For each time the contestant read out their new name, $100 would be given to him/her. On June 27, 2013, Bell Media completed its acquisition of Astral Media, making CKFM a sister station to sports talk-formatted CHUM and Hot AC-formatted CHUM-FM. Due to CRTC ownership limits, Bell and Astral's fellow FM stations CFXJ-FM and CHBM-FM were sold to Newcap Radio (now Stingray Radio)."

        "content": "From 1882 to 1886, Glentoran used Ormeau Park as their home ground. They moved to Westbourne in Ballymacarrett for six years until 1892. They then moved to The Oval. Initially it was on Dee Street, however in 1903 The Oval's pitch was rotated 90 degrees to its current location. During the early 20th century, the land on which The Oval stood was given in perpetuity to Glentoran by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Daniel Dixon. Due to its proximity to the Belfast shipyards, the Oval suffered severe bomb damage during the Belfast blitz in 1941. Aerial bombing destroyed both grandstands, causing the loss of Glentoran's club assets, and also left a large crater in the pitch. As a result, the ground was flooded repeatedly by the Connswater River; the water pumps were insufficient to drain the pitch. The ground was out of use until 1949 when it was rebuilt by the Glentoran club along with supporters, who had jointly formed the 'Back to the Oval' committee. During their exile, the club played games at the ground of fellow Belfast club, Distillery - Grosvenor Park. In 1953 the main grandstand was built. In September 1995, Glentoran had an advertising board with \"JESUS\" in white letters on a black background erected at The Oval. This became known colloquially as the \"Jesus sign\". It remained at the ground until 2010 when Glentoran officials removed it, saying that they needed the space to sell advertising because of the club's serious financial troubles and because \"The sign had garnered no income for Glentoran for several years. It could be said that, in this case, God has not provided.\" In 2000 The Oval received funding for the refurbishment of the railway stand, by bolting seats on to the old terracing to create a 1,600-person-capacity stand. It was funded by a small grant as part of the much bigger \u00a32,000,000 investment in Northern Irish sports announced by the Northern Ireland sports minister Michael McGimpsey. Other than new floodlights and a small section of terrace refurbishment, the ground has not applied for nor received any public investment since. In 2005, after a match between Glentoran and rival team Linfield, Linfield fans broke down a gate in The Oval to access the pitch and throw objects at Glentoran fans in the main stand after both sets of fans had been throwing missiles at each other beforehand. Two people were charged with rioting. In 2008, The Oval was the site of a protest by the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster against a decision by the Irish Football Association to allow football matches to be played on Sundays, a first in Northern Ireland due to traditional sabbatarianism. The protesters were concerned that regular Sunday matches would attract churchgoers away from attending church. The protest was led by Reverend David McIlveen, who said \"Fundamentally, it is a desecration of God's day.\" In October 2010 the neo nazi British National Party (BNP), who were trying to gain electoral support, held a rally outside The Oval. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Member of the Legislative Assembly, Robin Newton described the BNP's presence outside The Oval as \"nauseous\". In July 2011, an incendiary bomb was discovered outside The Oval requiring evacuation of surrounding streets. In October 2011 during an Irish Cup match between Glentoran and Portadown, a Portadown fan threw fireworks onto the pitch, injuring Glentoran's assistant manager Pete Batey and goalkeeping coach Davy McClelland. In the 21st century, with the continued lack of investment, the Oval has become comparatively dilapidated and has required constant temporary repairs to fulfill Health and Safety requirements for Glentoran to continue hosting its home matches there. In 2009, Glentoran's Irish Cup match against Limavady United was abandoned after the stadium's floodlight pylons started shaking in the high winds and the referee deemed it too dangerous for the match to continue. In 2012, after considering selling naming rights to The Oval, Glentoran unveiled plans to move the club to a new stadium in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast. The Oval was sold to property developers in March 2013 for \u00a34\u00a0million. Glentoran's chairman suggested that the Oval might be redeveloped into social housing. In March 2021, Glentoran submitted plans to Belfast City Council for a major revamp for the football ground. The plans include an entire revamp of the ground, this would include building two new stands totalling 4,000 seats, and two standing terrancings at each end of the pitch with capacity 1,000 each, bringing the stadium capacity to 6,000 spectators, it is estimated to cost between \u00a38 and \u00a310 million."

        "content": "The Oval is located near the Port of Belfast, and Harland and Wolff's Samson and Goliath cranes are visible from inside the stadium. It is viewed as a historic ground by football fans because of its concrete terraces and steel fencing. This limits its capacity in UEFA-sanctioned matches to the 3,000 seats in the two main stands as terracing has not been permitted in UEFA matches since 1998. The stadium's capacity is 26,556, but was estimated in 2010 by the Northern Ireland Assembly to have a safe capacity of 5,056 under safety legislation. However, since 2011, the safe capacity permitted by Health and Safety authorities is 5,300; before 2010 the stadium could hold more than 8,000. Linfield's manager David Jeffrey criticised these restrictions and said that they were \"murdering local football.\" The main stand holds 2,720 and the Railway stand holds 2,070. The Oval's record attendance is 55,000 for a European Cup Winners Cup match against Rangers on 27 September 1966. The design of the main stand is very similar to the one at Springfield Park, former home of Wigan Athletic. This was also built in 1953."

        "content": "The earliest settlement at Rawtenstall was probably in the early Middle Ages, during the time when it formed part of the Rossendale Valley in the Honour of Clitheroe, and consisted of simple dwellings for forest servants and animals. More substantial buildings may have followed in the 15th and 16th centuries with corn and flour mills. The town entered a major period of growth during the Industrial Revolution, as new mills were constructed to process cotton. The climate and weather were conducive to the industry, as was the town's nearby location to the rapidly developing industrial and mercantile centre at Manchester, dubbed 'Cottonopolis'. Only a few of these mills survive today, and none are operational anymore. During this period, the brothers Thomas, David and Peter Whitehead became important entrepreneurs in the town. They built a number of mills, including one of the earliest mills in the valley, at Lower Mill, and the still existing Ilex Mill. They also built substantial houses for themselves at Holly Mount, as well as large numbers of terraced houses for their workers. Other industries active in this period included quarrying and small scale coal mining, as well as an expanding commercial sector. As with many mid-Lancashire towns, it saw a population decline in the 20th century, going from 30,000 inhabitants in the 1911 census to 21,500 in the 1971 census. With the decline of the traditional manufacturing industries, shoemaking became one of the last survivors. this was usually known locally as the slipper industry, since slipper-making grew from the local processing of felt, which itself grew from the textile industry. The firm of H. W. Tricketts, in nearby Waterfoot, had been a major producer and exporter of footwear across the British Empire, but shoemaking declined rapidly from the 1980s. Firms closed as production moved overseas, and the remaining companies are largely importers. The church of St Nicholas (Church of England) is at Newchurch (rebuilt 1825) as is the Roman Catholic church of St Peter (1892). Other churches are St Michael's Lumb, St James's Waterfoot, St Anne's Edgeside, St John's Cloughfold, St Mary's Oakenhead, St John the Evangelist's Crawshawbooth, St Mary and All Saints Goodshaw (rebuilt 1790). Another RC church (dedicated to St James the Less) is at Oakenhead and there are a number of Nonconformist chapels."

Subsequently, Rawtenstall was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1891 and in 1894 a civil parish was created to match the borders of the borough. Following the local government reorganisation in 1974 Rawtenstall became part of the Borough of Rossendale. Rawtenstall is part of the Rossendale and Darwen constituency, after the constituency of Rossendale was abolished in 1983. The constituency sends one member of parliament to the House of Commons. Jake Berry MP has been the Member of Parliament for Rossendale and Darwen since 2010."

In 2007 a proposal to demolish part of the previous bus station and build a Lidl store on the site was agreed and the new store was finally completed in 2009. Lancashire County Council and Rossendale Borough Council then eventually replaced the old bus station with a modern bus interchange, which commenced service on Sunday 24 November 2019. Rawtenstall railway station also serves the town, but since the closure of the main line to Manchester, it now operates mainly as a tourist route, as part of the East Lancashire Railway, of which Rawtenstall station forms the northern terminus. The M66 motorway from Manchester is linked to Rawtenstall via the A56 Edenfield bypass, allowing for a driving time between Manchester and Rawtenstall of around half an hour.

An agreement between Rossendale Council and the owners of the Rawtenstall centre, Ashcap, in February 2011, was said to \"improve Rawtenstall town centre\". In late 2011 the shopping centre was demolished, creating a new town square area, where local markets and other events are infrequently held. Rossendale Council funded the demolition using money set aside for a public pool in neighbouring town Haslingden. This move was controversial locally, but the completed bus station has also attracted positive comment. Since 2017 several new bars, shops, bistros and venues have opened in the centre of the town, along with a rejuvenated market under new management. Close by to the Cricket Ground is the Weavers Cottage. This is a characterful 18th century loom shop, which has been restored as a small museum containing a Victorian kitchen, a clog shop and a working hand loom. The Rossendale Valley's local newspaper, the Rossendale Free Press was originally based in Rawtenstall, before being bought out by the Manchester Evening News in 2009 and subsequently moving to Manchester. Rawtenstall also has one of the largest indoor markets in Rossendale (a sign declaring it to be \"probably the friendliest market in the world\"), which suffered a serious arson attack in March 2011. The town is also home to the traditional herbalist and temperance bar Fitzpatrick's Herbal Health, which claims to be the oldest brewer of sarsaparilla and dandelion and burdock in the country. Fitzpatrick's gained television acclaim in April 2005 when it won the Famous Sarsaparilla Taste-off on ITV. It is the last bar of its kind in England. The acclaimed fashion boutique Sunday Best was opened in 1971 by Jan Shutt and is situated on Bank Street. Sunday Best won The Daily Telegraph magazine's best shop in Britain award for women's fashion in 2011 whilst Roland's Florist on Bacup Road was runner up in the best florist category. The awards were judged by TV shopping guru Mary Portas. Police facilities in Rawtenstall were one of five sites used for the training of new recruits to the Lancashire Constabulary. In late 2011, due to funding cuts, Rawtenstall Police Station, along with various other stations in the area, closed down. Rawtenstall is also the location of the area's county and magistrates' courts."

Donated to the township of Rawtenstall in 1902 by Richard Whitaker, who brought the house from Hardman for the purposes of civic recreation, the property is now known as The Whitaker, previously Rossendale Museum and Art Gallery. The gardens and surrounding land are laid out as a public park. The park itself has tennis courts, a bowling green, basketball court, an Incredible Edible area, a skateboard area and a playground as well as formal gardens and fountains. The recently refurbished museum contains exhibits of local history, gallery spaces, and a Cabinet of Curiosities room. There is an extensive exhibition of taxidermy, and gallery areas for displaying contemporary art and other exhinbitions. Arthur Mee considered it 'one of the best small museums in the North', saying \"...perhaps the most fascinating things in the museum are the Domestic Bygones, with hourglasses, toys and spinning wheels, snuff boxes and tinder boxes, the sand dredgers used before blotting-paper was known, rushlights and moulds for making candles, a grand collection of the homely things our forefathers (sic) used\". In 2019 The Whitaker was awarded a National Lottery Heritage Fund award of \u00a31.7 million to convert the museum and the former barn and stables. This has doubled its size and enabled the museum to develop its displays and education work, its cafe/restaurant and bar, as well as the study spaces and a shop. It reopened at the end of July 2021, and now includes the old Rossendale Council Parks Department yard at the rear which has been converted to a multi-purpose public area."

        "content": "In 1865 a competition for the design of a memorial to Queen Victoria's late Prince Consort, Prince Albert, was won by W. J. Barre, who had earlier designed Belfast's Ulster Hall. Initially Barre was not awarded his prize and the contract was secretly given to Lanyon, Lynn, and Lanyon, who had come second. Following public outcry the contract was eventually awarded to Barre. The construction cost of \u00a32,500 (2011: \u00a3) was raised by public subscription. The sandstone memorial was constructed between 1865 and 1869 by Fitzpatrick Brothers builders and stands 113 feet tall in a mix of French and Italian Gothic styles. The base of the tower features flying buttresses with heraldic lions. A statue of the Prince in the robes of a Knight of the Garter stands on the western side of the tower and was sculpted by SF Lynn. A two tonne bell is housed in the tower and the clock was made by Francis Moore of High Street, Belfast. As a result of being built on wooden piles on marshy, reclaimed land around the River Farset, the top of the tower leans four feet off the perpendicular. Due to this movement, some ornamental work on the belfry was removed in 1924 along with a stone canopy over the statue of the Prince. This gave rise to the expression that the tower \u201chas the time and the inclination.\u201d Being situated close to the docks, the tower was once infamous for being frequented by prostitutes plying their trade with visiting sailors. However, in recent years regeneration has turned the surrounding Queen's Square and Custom's House Square into attractive, modern public spaces with trees, fountains and sculptures. The clock was damaged in a Provisional Irish Republican Army bomb explosion outside nearby River House in High Street on 6 January 1992."

        "content": "The United Nations International School (UNIS) is a private international school in New York City, established in 1947. Many members of the United Nations staff arriving with young families found unexpected difficulties with New York's school system. Among them was K. T. Behanan and his wife, who arrived from India in May 1947 with their 5-year-old son, to work on educational policy at the UN's Trusteeship Council. The Behanans banded together with other UN families who were in a similar situation to establish in 1947 the United Nations International School at Lake Success, with Dr Behanan as chairman of its board. The school was founded to provide an international education, while preserving its students' diverse cultural heritages. Today, UNIS has over 1600 students in two locations, serving the United Nations, international and New York communities. The Manhattan campus, overlooking the East River, is K12; until 2022, the school also ran a K-8 school at a campus in Jamaica Estates, Queens. UNIS was one of the pilot schools of the International Baccalaureate (IB) and was among those awarding the first diplomas. The comprehensive K12 curriculum prepares UNIS students for the IB, and the school's internationally recognized academic standards enables students to go on to study in top colleges and universities in the United States and worldwide. The main language of instruction is English and all students study French or Spanish, beginning in elementary school. Arabic, Chinese, German, Italian, Japanese and Russian are also taught beginning in the seventh grade at the Manhattan campus. Additional mother tongues may be studied after school. The school's current executive director is Dan Brenner. UNIS is a member of the Council of International Schools, the International Baccalaureate Organization, the European Council of International Schools, the New York State Association of Independent Schools, the National Association of Independent Schools, the College Board and is registered with the New York Board of Regents as an independent, not-for-profit school."

Junior and senior students enroll in the International Baccalaureate Diploma (IBDP) or IB Courses, where a wide range of subjects are offered. Within the framework of IB requirements, students have the possibility to choose from over 200 course combinations. Students are taught in relatively small classes, with averages of 17 children in kindergarten (JA), 17 in grade 1 (J1), 17 in grade 2 (J2), 19 in grades 34 (J3-J4), and 21 in middle and high school (M1-T4). Emphasis is placed on preparation for the IB exams during High School, for which virtually all seniors sit (full Diploma or Certificate). Children whose parents transfer from abroad to work for the United Nations, Missions to the UN, and Consulates enjoy priority in terms of admission, but admission is not necessarily automatic. All children are required to be interviewed and assessed in person at UNIS, in addition to consideration of official school reports. The AEFE categorizes this school as a French international school."

Henry Smith (d. 1627) was a wealthy citizen and salter of London who gave much money to parishes in London and Surrey during his lifetime and in his will. He is buried in Wandsworth parish church and is supposed to have been born in Wandsworth. In 1617 he gave \u00a3500 towards the purchase of land in Carshalton, the rent of which was to support the poor of Wandsworth. Another \u00a3100 bequest came from Mrs. Elizabeth Blackwell. In 1814 the lands were described as being just over 116 acres and having a building, barn and outhouses. The Wandsworth Poor Lands lay on either side of Wrythe Lane at the southernmost part of the St. Helier estate footprint. Another local benefactor was Christopher Muschamp, who died in 1660 and is buried at All Saints, Carshalton. He bequeathed \u00a3200 to buy land, the yearly rental of which was to purchase apprenticeships for two poor children who had been born in the parish. Pasture land was bought from Henry Byne in Cannon Sheephouse Lane, which is now known as Green Wrythe Lane. Like the adjoining Sutton Common, most of the area remained semi-rural until the early 20th century. The estate was built between 1928 and 1936 by the London County Council as an overspill estate for the re-housing of people from decaying inner London areas. It was designed as a garden city, with landscaping by the landscape architect Edward Prentice Mawson. Development was spurred by the opening of Morden Underground station in 1926, and the Wimbledon to Sutton railway line in 1930, with a station at St Helier. These services provided rapid links into central London for the residents. The estate was named in honour of Lady St Helier, who was an LCC Alderman from 1910 to 1927. It was the second largest (after the Becontree-Dagenham estate) of a series of 'out-county' cottage estates and was based on the Garden City ideas of Ebenezer Howard. The area had previously consisted largely of lavender fields, the last remnants of the famous Mitcham lavender industry. In remembrance of the area's historic ownership by Westminster Abbey, the roads are named in alphabetical order after Monasteries and Abbeys starting in the north-west with Aberconway Road and ending with Woburn Road in the south-east. The imposing St Helier Hospital was opened in 1938. John Major, UK Prime Minister from 1990 to 1997, was born there in 1943. The estate's Bishop Andrewes Church, in Wigmore Road, was designed by the architect Geddes Hyslop in 1933."

There has been a little amount of infilling around the outskirts, and the estate now merges into the suburbs of Sutton, Carshalton and Morden. The area is served by London Bus routes 80, 151, 154, 157, 164, 280, 470, N44, S1, S4 and St Helier railway station."

The land eventually came to belong to the Sterling Iron Works, which mined and shipped iron ore from a number of sites within the park. The last of the mines was closed in the 1920s. The park was established in 1998 after New York State paid $55 million for  of land using a combination of public and private funds.  The Trust for Public Land and the Open Space Institute (OSI) lead the negotiations for the initial purchase leading to the creation of the park. The initiative to achieve this goal was led by the Public-Private Partnership to Save Sterling Forest, consisting of New York and New Jersey conservation organizations and chaired by Robert O. Binnewies, Executive Director of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. In November 1999, The Trust for Public Land and the Open Space Institute purchased 659 acres from New York University. In December 2000, The Trust for Public Land and the Open Space Institute announced an additional 1,065 acres to be added to Sterling Forest State Park. Funders and supporters for Preservation of Sterling Forest State Park include: The Wallace Fund, New York State's Environmental Protection Fund, Forest Legacy Program, the State of New Jersey, the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Fund for the Hudson Highlands, and Palisades Interstate Park Commission (PIPC), Governor Pataki, The Clinton Administration and other federal support. In 2005, The Trust for Public Land and the State of New York Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation purchased a 90-acre farm land in Warwick, NY to add to the state park. In 2006, the park was expanded after a  tract in the center of the forest came on the market, called Sterling Forge.  Although Sterling Forest LLC developers had planned to construct 107 luxury homes and an 18-hole golf course on the tract, local residents and concerned environmentalists rallied and were able to procure the tract for the state park. The final $13.5 million sale price was negotiated by The Trust for Public Land, and paid in part out of the state's Environmental Protection Fund. In February 2021, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the addition of 112 acres to the state park, as a result of a partnership with the Orange County Land Trust."

Construction of the Golestan Shopping Center began a few years after the Iran\u2013Iraq War. It was designed by Jordan Gruzen Architects in 1978 and built by another American company by the name Starrett, although some sections were never completed. Today, several modern shopping centers including Golestan, Iran Zamin, and Milad-e-Noor are located in this area.

An international school is located nearby, within the town, and a second is minutes away in Sa'adat Abad. Because of the eastward current of the air in Tehran and its constant purification by the adjacent mountains, this town is less polluted compared to other northern parts of the city. These and many more advantages have made this area a prime and pleasant location for living, attracting many foreign temporary residents, diplomats and expatriates."

        "content": "Callowhill is a neighborhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is roughly located in the vicinity of Callowhill Street, between Vine Street, Spring Garden Street, Broad Street, and 8th Street. It is named for Hannah Callowhill Penn, William Penn's second wife.  Callowhill was formerly home to large-scale manufacturing and other industries, of which an architectural history has been left in the form of grand old abandoned factories. During the 1970s and 1980s, the population of Callowhill plummeted, and although numbers are rising, it is a fairly unpopulated section of the city compared to surrounding neighborhoods. Recently developers have started to employ adaptive reuse projects, converting them into loft style housing; so much so that many have termed the neighborhood \"The Loft District\". In 2010 the Callowhill Industrial Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Callowhill is physically cut off from its neighbor to the south, Chinatown, by the Vine Street Expressway. This has largely prevented Chinese businesses from spreading north, although some industrial and storage uses by the Chinese community have been placed in Callowhill. Vine Street is also blamed for the abrupt drop in pedestrian life above Chinatown, and the struggle faced by efforts to redevelop this section of the city that lies between Center City and North Philadelphia. The former Reading Railroad train trestle, the Reading Viaduct, is a defining feature of the Callowhill neighborhood. Neighborhood groups have proposed that the abandoned structure be maintained as a public park. The Reading Viaduct park plan gained momentum in 2009 when Philadelphia's Center City District (CCD), and its influential president Paul Levy, became enamored of the idea and ultimately became a partner to help manage the project. CCD announced on Tuesday, February 6, 2018 that the first phase of the quarter-mile-long, elevated park would open in spring 2018. The actual grand opening of The Rail park was held on June 14, 2018, attracting a large crowd. Philadelphia Traffic Court is in Callowhill, at Spring Garden Street and North 8th Street."

        "content": "The main span is 190 metres which, at the time of its construction, was the longest pre-stressed concrete span in use in the UK. The two spans adjacent to the main span are 106m, known as anchor spans. Most of the other spans are 59m. The total length is 1,287 metres from Wherstead to the site of the former Ipswich Airport. The width is 24 metres with an air draft of 43 metres; the bridge had to be at least 41 metres high. The approach roads were designed by CH Dobbie & Partners of Cardiff, later bought by Babtie, Shaw and Morton then Jacobs in 2004. The bridge is constructed of a pair of continuous concrete box girders with expansion joints that allow for expansion and contraction. The girders are hollow, allowing for easier inspection, as well as providing access for services, including telecom, power, and a 711mm water main from the nearby Alton Water reservoir. The necessary inspections still cause major disruption to traffic every six years; during the inspection in the summer of 2005, the delays caused by lane closures and speed restrictions added between 30 and 60 minutes to journey times during the peak commuting periods. The bridge design took into consideration the impact on the Orwell Estuary, as well as the needs of the port of Ipswich. The location close to the southern edge of Ipswich was deemed convenient for the industrial areas of the West Bank Terminal and Ransomes Industrial Estate on the eastern end. The bridge was set at an angle to the river to get the best relationship to the surrounding terrain. The air draft of the central span was chosen to be as low as possible without adversely affecting port operations. Although some have said that the resulting hump affects visibility and road safety, there have not been enough incidents causing injury for the Highways Agency to identify it for greater detailed investigation and possible amendments. The consulting engineers were Sir William Halcrow and Partners. Frederick Gibberd Partners worked on the project to ensure the bridge was as sympathetic as possible to its surroundings, with the final design winning the approval of the Royal Fine Art Commission. The Department for Transport funded the project and, partly because of the bridge, paid for radars and cameras to be installed at the port's Orwell Navigation Service to monitor the river and the bridge."

The main span was constructed using a balanced cantilever technique, casting sections on alternating sides of the pier in a weekly cycle. H\u00f8sveis & Bofa of H\u00f8nefoss in Norway helped form the box girder (steelwork). The roller bearings were from Maurer AG of Germany. Mageba UK (Swiss) of Bicester supplied the bridge bearings and expansion joints. The pre-stressed concrete box girder sections had VSL tendons and GKN super-strand wire rope. The construction gantries were fabricated by Fairfield Mabey. It was part of the first part of the Ipswich Bypass; the contract for both approach roads was given to Costain (\u00a310.7m, eastern) and Cementation (\u00a39.3m, western). For this section of the bypass, Robert McGregor & Sons, subcontracting to Cementation laid 6,900m of concrete in 48 days with a slipform paver; Costain laid 10,400m of concrete in 31 days with a concrete train. Construction of the bridge commenced in October 1979 and was completed 1 April 1982. It was opened on 17 December 1982 by David Howell, Baron Howell of Guildford, then the Secretary of State for Transport."

It then joins with U.S. Route 101 for the last few miles in Santa Barbara County before crossing the Santa Maria River and splitting off in San Luis Obispo County. For the next , SR 166 crosses the Santa Barbara/San Luis Obispo county line a total of five times. This stretch follows the Cuyama River through a canyon separating the Sierra Madre Mountains from mountains in San Luis Obispo County, and then opens out into the Cuyama Valley, passing cattle ranches, going through the Russell Ranch Oil Field, and passing Aliso Canyon Road, the turnoff to the South Cuyama Oil Field. On the north during this stretch is the mile-high Caliente Range, which contains Caliente Mountain, the highest peak in San Luis Obispo County. After going through the towns of New Cuyama and Cuyama, the highway meets SR 33 north of Ventucopa. SR 33 and SR 166 merge until reaching Maricopa, where SR 166 heads due east for its last , intersecting with I-5 about  north of the Grapevine. SR 166 ends at SR 99 in Mettler, and it is the last exit for both I-5 and SR 99 southbound before they merge near Wheeler Ridge. In Kern County, Highway 166 is known as the Maricopa Highway. West of Maricopa, where it skirts Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, it is called the Cuyama Highway. In the cities of Santa Maria and Guadalupe, it is known as Main Street. SR 166 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The route is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. From US 101 to SR 33, SR 166 is known as the \"CHP Officers Irvine and Stovall Memorial Highway\". In February 1998, a large storm swelled the Cuyama River and caused it to wash out a section of the highway. Officers Britt Irvine and Rick Stovall were responding to an early morning call about a truck accident when their CHP cruiser drove off the washed out section."

        "content": "Originally the property of the Earl of Huntingdon (c. 1750), father of Steele's Aspasia, who built a mansion here, the property passed through various hands into those of The 1st Viscount Cremorne (1725\u20131813), an Irish peer from County Monaghan, who greatly beautified it. The name Cremorne is the name of a barony, an old administrative unit, in County Monaghan in Ireland. It is an Anglicisation of what in modern Irish is Cr\u00edoch Mh\u00farn. This roughly translates as the 'Bounds of Mourne', from the territorial domain of an ancient clan or sept called Mughdorna in Old Irish. The name is cognate with the Mountains of Mourne. The property was sold by the Dawson family, Barons Cremorne, in 1831 to a Baron de Berenger, who was a convicted fraudster whose real name was Charles Random. de Berenger converted the site into a sports facility, called The Stadium, and became a proponent of self-defence techniques.  The business failed in 1843, but not before de Berenger had added some attractions of pleasure gardens of the time, including hosting a balloon ascent in 1838. For two years the gardens opened for summer, including an opening festival billed as \"Pie de Nie\" with Balloon ascent, for instance, were held, and the property was sold in 1845.  James Ellis took over the license in January 1845. The twelve-acre site was then developed by James Ellis into a proprietary place of entertainment and spectacle, being popular as such from 1845 to 1877. The Cremorne Gardens occupied a large site running between the Thames and the King's Road. Opened in 1845, they were noisy and colourful pleasure gardens featuring restaurants, entertainments, dancing and balloon ascents, and could be entered from the north gate on Kings Road or another by the Cremorne Pier on the river. Edward Tyrrel Smith paid Pauline Violante to attempt to cross the Thames in Albanian costume on 12 August 1861. A wire that was too slack meant that she failed at the first attempt but she succeeded at her second try. She walked from Battersea Bridge to the Cremorne Gardens, watched by 20,000 people. Carlo Valerio would die in another tight rope demonstration at Cremorne Gardens. The famous artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler painted several nocturnes of Cremorne Gardens between 1872 and 1877.  He was a resident of Cheyne Walk, a mere few hundred yards from the Gardens. His painting Cremorne Gardens No 2 is full of fashionable and active figures and parallels to some extent the \u2018modern life\u2019 paintings of his French associates Manet and Tissot with whom he was in close contact during the early 1870s. Cremorne Gardens was doubtless a most attractive location, not only for its light displays but also for the brilliant array of fashionable people who gathered there. They provided the setting for Nocturne in Black and Gold: the Firewheel and Nocturne in Black and Gold: the Falling Rocket of c.1874, the latter resulting in the Whistler versus Ruskin trial of 1878. Walter Greaves was the son of a Chelsea boat-builder who used to ferry Turner across the river; Walter and his brother Harry also performed the same service for Whistler, and in about 1863 became his unpaid studio assistants and pupils. They adored Whistler, accompanied him wherever he went, imitated his dress and manner, made the frames for his canvases, bought his materials and prepared his colours. Walter said; \u201cHe taught us to paint, and we taught him the waterman\u2019s jerk\u201d. Their close association lasted well into the 1890s, Whistler favouring Walter as he was the more gifted of the two brothers. Two of his most successful images were Regatta at Hammersmith Bridge and Chelsea under Snow; like Whistler he concentrated on areas around the Thames. He died in poverty, having been taken in by the Charterhouse. Greaves chooses to depict Whistler near the Crystal Platform. A reporter in the Illustrated London News (30 May 1857) admired the structure's \u201cinclosing ironwork...enriched, by Defries and Son, with devices in emerald and garnet cut-glass drops, and semicircles of lustre and gas jets, which have a most brilliant effect.\u201d The pavilion was about three hundred and sixty feet in circumference. It was encrusted with ornamental pillars, gas jets, and over forty plate-glass mirrors in black frames. In the upper portion of the pagoda (seen here), where the orchestra played, there were seventeen gas lit chandeliers. This particular feature of the Gardens was clearly a favourite with Greaves as he chose to depict it on several occasions, for example The Dancing Platform, Cremorne Gardens (1870s) and in an etching of this period, which depicts the same view as Whistler in the Cremorne Gardens. In the former Whistler is depicted as the natty flaneur, striding along with and yet separate from the crowd. In the latter Whistler is seated but maintains the image of flaneur, the impartial, non-judgmental observer of contemporary life. He leans to one side to acknowledge a fellow dandy, much to the impatience of the young woman who stands at his table. Cremorne Gardens rapidly acquired a reputation as the territory of the demi-monde frequented by women of questionable morals. His associate could buy such a woman; this is implied by his indifference towards her, the attention of the passing woman as well as the undisguised stare of the gentleman at the railing. Whistler and the Greaves family were frequent visitors before the gardens closed in 1877.  Cremorne Gardens never acquired the fashionable fame of Vauxhall Gardens, and finally became so great an annoyance to some of the more influential residents in the neighbourhood that a renewal of its licence was refused, and most of the site of the gardens was soon built over. The name survives in Cremorne Road. Donald James Wheal, in his first-person memoir of life in working-class Chelsea,  World's End gives a lively account of the almost-forgotten history and destruction of Cremorne Gardens."

        "content": "A vestige of the gardens survives next to the Thames, just east of Lots Road Power Station. It is largely paved over, and there is little to suggest the grand scale of the original gardens, though it still has two attached jetties, an echo of the landing stages where visitors to the original pleasure gardens would arrive by boat. Recently, one of the original grand iron gates from the gardens has been restored and stands on the current site . A Cremorne Gardens was also established in Melbourne, Australia. On 13 September 2010 Thames Water published its preferred sites for building work on its Thames Tideway super sewer.  Thames Water originally proposed that an access road cut straight through Cremorne Gardens. Cremorne Gardens secured a Green Flag award for the first time in 2010 as one of the best green spaces in England.  Councillor Nicholas Paget-Brown, Cabinet Member for Environment and Leisure Services, attended the flag raising ceremony at Cremorne Gardens at the end of July along with the mayor of Kensington and Chelsea, Councillor James Husband. Local Conservative Kensington and Chelsea Councillors and residents have promised to try to save the Gardens from use as an access road to build the Thames Tunnel. .  Phil Stride representing Thames Water stated \"We are happy to work with the council to use whatever access route they can help us find.\"  Early in 2011, the Lots Road Waste Centre owned by the council ceased operation.  The former Waste Centre is closer to the proposed Tideway Tunnel, therefore is an alternative site for the access road.  However, Cremorne Gardens is still listed as the preferred site on the Thames Water website even though it is the council's decision. In 2014, Cremorne Gardens was again under threat from the local council which suggested to Transport For London that there be a \"Chelsea West\" station on Kings Road near World's End and on the site of the Cremorne Estate for Crossrail Two.  Cremorne Gardens would have been destroyed to use as the building site for the station.  After a huge outcry from residents, the council abandoned its support for Chelsea West."

        "content": "Latium adiectum or Latium Novum is an ancient Roman geographical term used at least as early as the 1st century AD, when mention of it occurs in Pliny in conjunction with Latium antiquum, the original territory of the Latini tribe. Says Pliny of the latter: Its inhabitants have often changed: at various times it has been occupied by various peoples \u2014 the Aborigines, the Pelasgi, the Arcades, the Siculi, the Aurunci, the Rutuli ... Then he speaks of a later extension to the river Garigliano, to include the Volsci, Osci and Ausones. The \"last town\" in the Adiectum Latium, or \"Extension of Latium\", was Sinuessa. Pliny's remarks concerning Latium are part of his description of Italy: ...a land which is at once the nurseling and the mother of all other lands, chosen by providence of the gods to make heaven itself more glorious, to unite scattered empires, to make manners gentle, to draw together in converse by community of language the jarring and uncouth tongues of so many nations, to give mankind civilization, and in a word to become throughout the world the single fatherland of all the races. After waxing yet more eloquent concerning Italy \u2014 he was in fact north Italian himself, rather than Roman \u2014 he then gives: an account of a circuit of Italy, and of its cities. Herein it is necessary to premise that we intend to follow the authority of his late Majesty Augustus, and to adopt the division that he made of the whole of Italy into eleven regions ... Latium and Campania together comprise Region I, of which Latium is divided into Latium Vetus or Antiquus and Latium Adiectum or Novum."

Here were situated Signia, Frusino, Fabrateria, Fregellae, Sora, Arpinum, Atina, Aquinum, Casinum, and Interamna; Anxur (Terracina) was the only seaport that properly belonged to the Volscians, the coast from there to the mouth of the Liris being included in the territory of the Aurunci, or Ausones as they were termed by Greek writers, who possessed the maritime towns of Fundi, Formiae, Caieta, and Minturnae, together with Suessa in the interior, which had replaced their more ancient capital of Aurunca. Sinuessa, on the seacoast between the Liris (Garigliano) and the Vulturnus, at the foot of the Mons Massicus, was the last town in Latium according to the official use of the term and was sometimes assigned to Campania, while Suessa was more assigned to Latium. On the other hand, as Nissen points out (Italische Landeskunde, ii. 554), the Pons Campanus, by which the Via Appia crossed the Savo some 9 m. SE of Sinuessa, indicates by its name the position of the old Campanian frontier. In the interior the boundary fell between Casinum and Teanum Sidicinum, at about the 100th milestone of the Via Latina, a fact which led later to the jurisdiction of the Roman courts being extended on every side to the 100th mile from the city, and to this being the limit beyond which banishment from Rome was considered to begin. Though the Apennines comprised within the boundaries of Latium do not rise to a height approaching that of the loftiest summits of the central range, they attain to a considerable altitude, and form steep and rugged mountain masses from 4,000 to 5,000 ft. high. They are traversed by three principal valleys: (1) that of the Anio, now called Aniene (and formerly Teverone), which descends from above Subiaco to Tivoli, where it enters the plain of the Campagna; (2) that of the  (River Sacco), which has its source below Palestrina (Praeneste), and flows through a comparatively broad valley that separates the main mass of the Apennines from the Volscian mountains or Monti Lepini, until it joins the Liris below Ceprano; (3) that of the Liris (Garigliano), which enters the confines of New Latium about 20 m. from its source, flows past the town of Sora, and has a very tortuous course from there to the sea at Minturnae; its lower valley is for the most part of considerable width, and forms a fertile tract of considerable extent, bordered on both sides by hills covered with vines, olives and fruit trees, and thickly studded with towns and villages."

The village grew up around the Badger Brewery, owned by Hall and Woodhouse, which is based there. At the 2001 census it had a population of 1,233. The appropriate electoral ward is called 'Portman' with naturally the most populous area being south of the river. The ward includes Bryanston School and also runs south west almost to Thornicombe. The total ward population at the abovementioned census was 2,436. Blandford St Mary has a busy Tesco supermarket and fuel station and a Homebase DIY store which attracts shoppers from the many villages that surround the Blandford area. In addition there are a number of offices in Stour Park. In the residential area there is a new housing estate and  primary school. An older area of the village near the river bridge to Blandford Forum has a traditional public house and a village green. Opposite is the old stone gate at the entrance of the Bryanston School estate. Outline planning permission has been given to redevelop the Hall & Woodhouse brewery site to include new offices and 200 new homes. Lower Blandford St Mary is a rural outpost of Blandford St Mary, in the farm fields to the south across the bypass road, with a small church and graveyard, and one or two historic houses. The Dorset Central Railway, which opened on 1 November 1860 from the LSWR station at Wimborne, had a station in the village, serving the neighbouring important market town of Blandford Forum. This was demolished when the line amalgamated to be part of the Somerset & Dorset Railway, and a bridge was built over the river Stour to the station at Blandford."

        "content": "Washington Park was initially designed by the German landscape architect Reinhard Schuetze between 1899 and 1908. His design remains fairly intact and included Smith and Grasmere lakes, and the Lily Pond, all fed with a city ditch that Shuetze had edged with Russian willows and other trees. Other pieces of his design remain intact and include the large meadow edged with a grove of trees to the south of Smith Lake, and the carriage-ways that meander through the park. Later landscape architects, such as Saco Rienk DeBoer and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. have added their own contributions to the park, adding the elegant boating pavilion, an evergreen grove on the north side of the park and other additions. Washington Park as a neighborhood started development soon after the founding of Denver though it was still fairly rural in nature. By 1886, there was enough population to create Denver's first suburb, South Denver, which by the silver bust of the 1890s was annexed into Denver due to financial difficulties. Development hastened with the creation of the park in 1899. Most of the houses were built of brick between 1900 and 1940. The park was designed in French country style with new paths and plantings introduced by city planner George Kessler in 1908. DeBoer architects were responsible for completing the big Perennial Garden at Downing in 1918 and Mt. Vernon Gardens in 1926. The Olmsted Brothers designed rolling Evergreen Hill, enhanced the pedestrian paths, and built the Lily Pond in 1912. The boating pavilion, built in 1913, was designed by Jacques Benedict in 1913 following the Italian style of architecture. The bathing beach was installed on Smith Lake in 1911 and the pedestrian and car bridges over City Ditch were installed by architect F.W. Ameter in 1912. The Field House, residence of poet and journalist Eugene Field was moved to the park's northwest edge by Titanic survivor and philanthropist Molly Brown in 1930. The modern Recreation center was designed in 1971 by the architectural firm Anderson Barker Rinker. Eugene Field, a reporter for the Denver Tribune between 1881 and 1883, lived in a small cottage at 315 West Colfax Avenue. Field is best remembered, though, for his children's poems. Years after Field left Denver and the house had been condemned, Molly Brown bought the house and donated it to the city. It was designated a landmark, moved to the east side of Washington Park, at Franklin St. and Exposition Ave., and restored. It served as the Eugene Field Branch of the Denver Public Library for many years. Field is further memorialized by the statue by Mabel Landrum Torrey, illustrating one of his most famous poems, \"Wynken, Blynken and Nod\". In the 1970s the house became the headquarters of the Park People and the library moved to a new building at University Blvd. and Exposition Ave. Since the late 1990s, Washington Park has become a very popular urban neighborhood because of its central location, its proximity to the park, and its access to several commercial business enclaves. This has led to a transformation of the neighborhood, which worries some residents because of an increased density, more traffic, and the propensity of some developers to \"pop the top\" or altogether \"scrape\" historic homes."

A recreation center with an indoor pool, free weights, and other athletic facilities is also located in the park. Smith Lake has a boathouse that can be rented out for various events. The park connects to the city via a number of bike trails at Exposition Avenue, Marion St. and Louisiana Avenue. The system of asphalt and gravel paths facilitates diverse uses: bicyclists, pedestrians, roller bladers, skateboarders, strollers, pet walkers, rented surreys, etc. The grove tree plantings planted at intervals allow views of the Front Range mountains west of the park. The park is also known for its largest flower garden in Denver, which was built in 1917. It was a Victorian-style Perennial Garden that included an elliptical lawn and symmetrical flowerbeds with 15,000 flower varieties. The flower garden also includes 54 flower beds in an informal arrangement. One garden is an exact replica of Martha Washington's garden at Mt. Vernon. Some of the artifacts in the park include the sculptor Mabel Torrey's \"Wynken, Blynken and Nod,\" which honors poet Eugene Field (1919); and George Carlson's bronze \"Early Day Miner,\" that depicts local history (1980). The Washington Park neighborhood is one of the oldest in Denver and includes many early twentieth century brick houses and even some late nineteenth century brick houses in West Washington Park. There are several commercial enclaves in the neighborhood such as South Gaylord Street and Alameda Avenue, as well as several smaller corner store areas located at stops of the former streetcars that ran down the residential streets. The South Pearl Street area, in the neighboring Platt Park neighborhood, is frequently misidentified as being part of the Washington Park neighborhood. The neighborhood borders I-25, which was expanded in 2006 and includes the RTD light rail. The Louisiana/Pearl station and University of Denver stations connect the southern part of the Washington Park neighborhood with light rail network, and the Broadway station serves West Washington Park. The south end of the park itself borders South High School."

A $1.5 million budget was prepared for renovation of parks south entrance, picnic site at Mt. Vernon gardens, and the City Ditch. The goals for treatment of the park included the preservation of historic site patterns, site features, structures, site remnants, and vegetation. Other works included the restoration of the definitive edges of the park spaces and re-establishment of tree groves, paths, and, topography defining the open spaces. Preservation of the perimeter road as a significant landscape characteristic, modified to reflect bicycle and pedestrian use of the road, was also one of the recommendations. Landscape features such as, meadow areas in the park were to be restored with native grasses and wildflowers to reduce water consumption. The lake shore restoration was intended to focus on historic lake design and rehabilitation of City Ditch to convey historic flows. Other goals included the reuse of irrigation water through city ditch system and water-saving measures for swimming pool, showers, faucets, and so on.  Most of the conservation practices address the conflicts between pedestrian, bicyclists and motorist, park plant diversity, and water quality issues."

The name \"Fleet\" is derived from , Old English for an inlet or estuary. Dorset County Council estimated that the population of the civil parish was 60 in 2013. The Great Storm of 1824  caused waves to breach Chesil Beach, and many of the buildings in the village were destroyed, including the nave of the original parish church. An eye-witness described the event: At six o'-clock on the morning of the 23rd I was standing with other boys by the gate near the cattle pound when I saw, rushing up the valley, the tidal wave, driven by a hurricane and bearing upon its crest a whole haystack and other debris from the fields below. We ran for our lives to Chickerell, and when we returned found that five houses had been swept away and the church was in ruins. A new church, Holy Trinity, was built a short distance inland and only the chancel of the old one stands today. J. Meade Falkner's smuggling novel Moonfleet is set in the village. There is a brass memorial to Falkner in the old church, together with brass plate memorials to members of the Mohun family whose name was used in the novel.

Carlisle is also home to Dickinson College, established in 1773, and the Penn State Dickinson School of Law. The United States Army War College is a United States Army school located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on the 500 acre (2\u00a0km2) campus of the historic Carlisle Barracks, a military post dating back to the 1770s.  It caters to high-level military personnel and civilians and prepares them for strategic leadership responsibilities.  It is the U. S. Army's most senior military educational institution. During the Gettysburg campaign of the American Civil War in the summer of 1863, Confederate troops marched through the Cumberland Valley, briefly occupying much of Cumberland County. In the 20th century, the suburbs of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the state capital, expanded extensively into eastern Cumberland County.  Carlisle also developed suburbs in adjoining townships."

Big Hasan Dagi has two nested craters with an  wide and  high inner cone that is the source of a lava flow. Fossil rock glaciers are found on the volcano. The volcano as a whole rises almost  around the surrounding terrain and covers an area of  with  of rocks. The terrain of Mount Hasan is formed by phreatomagmatic breccias, ignimbrites, lahar deposits, lava domes, lava flows and pyroclastic flow deposits. The pyroclastic flow deposits occur in the form of fans or valley flows, when they were channelled by topography. The northern flanks also feature two debris avalanche deposits with hummocky surfaces. The volcanics of Mount Hasan have been subdivided into a \"hot flow\" unit, a \"Mt.

        "content": "As a consequence of the subduction and eventual closure of the Neo-Tethys and continental collision between Arabia-Africa and Eurasia, Anatolia moves westward between the North Anatolian Fault and the East Anatolian Fault. This movement and the resulting tectonic deformation of Anatolia are responsible for volcanism in Central Anatolia which has been ongoing for the past 10 million years; this volcanism is defined as \"post-collisional\". Further, volcanism at Mount Hasan has been related to the Tuz G\u00f6l\u00fc Fault and its intersection with the Karaman-Aksaray faults; the former of these is one of two major fault systems in Central Anatolia which influence volcanism there, and volcanic products of Mount Hasan have been deformed by the fault. The Hasandag fault branches off the Karaman-Aksaray fault and cuts between the two summits of Mount Hasan. The westerly Mount Hasan, central  and easterly  form a mountain range, which is surrounded by plains and whose summits reach heights of over . Of these mountains,  is more heavily eroded compared to the steep cones of Hasan and like  is of early Pliocene age. This alignment is congruent with the tectonic patterns of Anatolia, where the collision between Africa and Eurasia follows the same trend. It and to some degree Mount Hasan are also surrounded by a large depression, and the volcanoes of this alignment are separated by faults. Additionally, Mount Hasan forms a volcanic lineament with  and the Karap\u0131nar Field. The basement in Central Anatolia is formed by magmatic, metamorphic and ophiolitic rocks, the former of which are of Paleozoic to Mesozoic age; it crops out at scattered sites and in the Kirshehir and Nigde massifs. The surface however consists mainly of Tertiary volcanic rocks, which are formed both by volcaniclastic material and individual volcanoes. Central Anatolia has undergone uplift, for which several mechanisms have been proposed."

        "content": "Mount Hasan has produced volcanic rocks with compositions ranging from basalt to rhyolite but the dominant components are andesite and dacite which define an older tholeiitic and a younger calc-alkaline or alkaline suite. These rocks in turn include amphibole, apatite, biotite, clinopyroxene, garnet, ilmenite, mica, olivine, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, pyroxene in the form of augite, bronzite, diopside, hypersthene and salite, and quartz. The older volcanic stages have produced basaltic andesite while dacite appears only in the most recent stage. Obsidian also occurs in the most recent stage although it is not an important component while most of the rocks are porphyritic. The basaltic family includes both basaltic andesite and alkali basalts with augite, clinopyroxene, garnet, hornblende, hypersthene, olivine, orthopyroxene, oxides and plagioclase. Magma mixing processes appear to be the most important mechanisms involved in the genesis of Mount Hasan magmas, which are derived from the mantle with participation of crustal components. Evidence of fractional crystallization has been encountered in the most recent stage rocks and more generally plays a role in the genesis of Hasan magmas although it does not explain all of the compositional traits. Older volcanic stages also show evidence of subduction influence while the more recent magmas are more indicative of intraplate processes, the effects of crustal extension and of the presence of water. In general, various sources have been proposed for the magmas of the Central Anatolian province."

Aside from the felsic central vent volcanism, basaltic volcanism also took place at Mount Hasan throughout its activity; this activity has been dated to 120,000, 65,000 and the most recent event 34,000 years ago. This volcanism however is not part of the actual Mount Hasan system. The main edifice has produced about  of magma every millennium. is the oldest (13 million years) volcanic structure, it is among the oldest volcanoes of the Central Anatolian volcanic province. This volcano is a small sized volcano with a caldera which crops out on the southwestern side of Mount Hasan. It grew over sediments to a present-day elevation of ; today it is eroded, partly buried by the younger Hasan volcanics and disrupted by strike-slip faulting. About 7 million years ago the Paleovolcano began to grow north of ; it too is buried by more recent volcanics but part of its deposits crop out on the northwestern flank of Mount Hasan in the form of ignimbrites, lahars and lava flows. The Paleovolcano also formed a caldera which produced the rhyolitic Dikmen-Taspinar Ignimbrites; formerly the Cappadocian tuffs were in general attributed to volcanism at Mount Hasan, Mount Erciyes and G\u00f6ll\u00fc Dag. The Quaternary activity gave rise to the Mesovolcano and Neovolcano, with the former centered between the two present-day summits. This volcano produced ignimbrites, lava domes and lava flows and eventually a caldera; it too has been dissected by faulting which probably also influenced the development of the volcano and its activity probably occurred between 1 and 0.15 million years ago. Finally, the Neovolcano grew within the caldera, producing various kinds of deposits; these include lava domes with accompanying pyroclastic flow deposits, breccia in the rim of the Mesovolcano caldera that probably formed through the interaction of intruding magma with water in the caldera, 700,000 years ago rhyolitic flows and ignimbrites accompanied by the formation of another,  caldera, and finally andesitic lava flows and lava domes which form the two main summits. Small Mount Hasan is probably older as it is more heavily eroded while the morphology of Big Hasan Dagi is fresher although its pyroclastic flow deposits are heavily incised. Dates of 33,000 and 29,000 years ago have been obtained on the summit domes and ages of 66,000\u00b17,000 years on the most recent monogenetic volcano south of Mount Hasan. Tephras found in the Konya plain and in a lake of the Turkish Lakes Region have been attributed to Mount Hasan. The debris flow from Mount Hasan occurred 150,000-100,000 years ago and a number of lava flows were emplaced during the last 100,000 years."

In 1519, when Spanish explorer Alonso \u00c1lvarez de Pineda sailed through the pass to what he later named Corpus Christi Bay, the island was inhabited by the Karankawa people.  By the 18th century, as a result of grazing herds of horses introduced by Spanish settlers, the island was first called \"Wild Horse\", then \"Mustang Island\". Up to the 1840s, the island and pass (now the ship channel) were used by buccaneers, Mexican smugglers, merchants and immigrants seeking their fortune or someone else's fortune. The pirate Jean Lafitte purportedly frequented Mustang and neighboring islands during the 1820s. During the Mexican\u2013American War, a small fort was built on the island to defend the entrance to Aransas Bay. Captain Robert Mercer was the first settler to set up residence on the island with his family. His wife is said to have been the first white woman in the area. He built a house there in 1853 and named it El Mar Rancho."

The turtles are endangered due to shrimpers' nets and they are popular in Mexico as boot material and food. On June 10, 2008, a sperm whale beached itself on one of the island's beaches. It had to be euthanized because the city did not have the equipment needed to move the large whale."

In addition to the two 19-storey blocks housing 2,060 flats, the contract included construction of the market and the primary school. A tender worth $146\u00a0million was approved in 1981 for the construction of Lok Nga Court. This Home Ownership Scheme estate comprises six residential \"flexi\" blocks and a four-storey car park with indoor games hall on top. The first phase of the estate (comprising the two rental housing blocks, primary school, and market) opened in 1982 as the Housing Authority's \"109th public rental estate\". An official opening ceremony was held for the completed estate on 6 December 1985. Governor Sir Edward Youde was supposed to officiate at this event but was suffering from the flu, and so the ceremony was instead held by Sir David Akers-Jones.

Following a significant and vocal local campaign, citing a large number of adverse factors, the government has abandoned plans for a substantial urban settlement here."

The trading post of Frederikshaab (sometimes anglicized as Frederick's Hope) was established by Jacob Severin's company in 1742 and named in honor of the Crown Prince Frederick (later King Frederick V of Denmark). The community prospered on trading fur and whale products. It also became known for its soapstone artists. The town has one of the finest churches in Greenland, built in 1909 from wood in the Norwegian style. Following the warming climatic trends since the 1920s, Paamiut developed a booming cod industry between the 1950s and 1989, when the stock dwindled. In connection with a development plan called G60 Paamiut was chosen as to be the place to live for the entire population of the former Paamiut municipality. Therefore, the number of people living there rose significantly during that period. There is local museum downtown in original buildings from the previous century, among them a carpenter workshop and a salt warehouse. The Danish Crown Princely family visited the town as part of an official tour of Greenland in summer 2014."

The stadium is currently being demolished and set to be replaced by a new stadium in the same location. The stadium, which had a seating capacity of 18,000, was opened on 16 October 1955 and was inaugurated by Hussein El Shafei, the Egyptian minister of social affairs, on behalf of President Gamal Abdel Nasser. On 1 February 2012, following a league match between Al Masry and Al Ahly, the incidents of Port Said Stadium riot occurred which resulted in the death of 72 Al Ahly fans, alongside 1 Al Masry supporter and 1 police officer, making it the deadliest tragedy in Egyptian sporting history. The stadium was banned from hosting any official football matches as a result, with an exception made in 2018 when the stadium hosted all Al Masry home fixtures in their CAF Confederation Cup campaigns during the 2018 and 2018\u201319 seasons. The last official match hosted by the stadium was played on 15 December 2018, a 2\u20130 defeat for Al Masry against Burkinab\u00e9 side Salitas. In late 2019, the stadium was officially closed to prepare for demolition process, which was originally scheduled to take place in 2020, but was postponed to a later date due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt. More than one year later, demolition work finally began on 4 July 2021. It's expected that Al Masry will move to their new stadium, which will have a seating capacity of 12,000, between 2024 and 2026. Previously, the stadium was owned by the Governorate of Port Said, and was known as Port Said Stadium, until 5 January 2016 when Port Said governor Adel El Ghadban agreed to transfer the stadium's ownership to Al Masry and changing its name to Al Masry Club Stadium as a result. The stadium also hosted some matches in numerous tournaments held in Egypt, including 1997 FIFA U-17 World Championship, 2006 Africa Cup of Nations, 2007 Pan Arab Games Football Tournament and 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup."

Crocker (1818\u20131875), a wealthy California lawyer and judge, and his wife, Margaret Crocker (1822\u20131901), began to assemble a significant collection of paintings and drawings during an extended trip to Europe, from 1869 to 1871. Upon their return to Sacramento, they set about creating an art gallery in part of their grand home at the corner of Third and O streets. The gallery became of the hub of social activity in Sacramento, hosting benefits for local organizations and welcoming prominent visitors including the Hawaiian queen, Lili\u02bbuokalani (1878), President Ulysses S. Grant (1879), and Oscar Wilde (1882). E.B. Crocker died in 1875. In 1885, his widow, Margaret, created a public art museum when she presented the E. B. Crocker Art Gallery and collection to the City of Sacramento and the California Museum Association, \"in trust for the public,\" the contents of which were valued at the time at more than $500,000. In 1978, the Crocker Art Gallery was renamed the Crocker Art Museum. In 2002, to accommodate a burgeoning collection and the needs of the growing population of Sacramento and California's Central Valley region, the museum commissioned the firm of Gwathmey Siegel & Associates to design a major addition.

The Crockers commissioned five major works from Nahl, including Sunday Morning in the Mines (1872). The Californian collection continued to expand, and now contains 150 years of painting, sculpture, and craft media covering genres that include Impressionism, Abstract Expressionism, and Pop Art, and features artists including early Sacramento painter Amanda Austin, Norton Bush, William Keith, Thomas Hill, Granville Redmond, Edwin Deakin, Guy Rose, Gottardo Piazzoni, Joan Brown, Elmer Bischoff, Roland Petersen, David Park, Jess, Richard Diebenkorn, Mel Ramos, and Wayne Thiebaud. The collection also includes American art from the late 19th century to the present.

        "content": "The collection of European art began with the Crocker family's trip to Europe, from 1869 to 1871. It was not a Grand Tour. The Crockers rented lodgings in Dresden for over a year, and traveled mostly in Germany. As a later director of the museum would write, \"Mr. Crocker was a novice and completely susceptible to a kind of fraud in his anxiety to become the possessor of a large collection of masterpieces. He acquired in his wholesale search a collection of more than 700 paintings,\"  most of them \"not by the few famous names given him by the dealers in Munich and Dresden.\" (Works said to be by Rembrandt, Rubens, Poussin, Salvator Rosa, and even Leonardo da Vinci appear in the initial 1876 catalogue, but were reattributed in following decades.) However, among Crocker's purchases were a number of genuinely rare works by a broader array of artists than he realized, and for a brief time the Crockers possessed the largest private art collection in the United States. Along with paintings, the Crockers also acquired 1344 Old Master drawings \"and untold numbers of prints of rare craftsmanship.\" Systematic study of the origin and significance of these drawings began only in the 21st century. Of more certain provenance were the numerous German and Central European paintings Crocker purchased, many by artists who were alive and working at the time. These 19th-century paintings would form the core of the European collection, along with a number of 17th-century Flemish and Dutch Golden Age still lives and genre scenes, as well as French and Italian works of the 17th and 18th centuries. Artists represented in Crocker's original collection include Maarten van Heemskerck, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Klaes Molenaer, Pieter Quast, Antonio Joli, Francesco Solimena, Paolo de Matteis, Claude-Joseph Vernet, Jacques-Louis David, Andreas Achenbach, and Karl von Piloty."

Gifts and promised gifts by the Beekhuis family of 67 19th-century Dutch landscapes are presented in the Beekhuis Foundation Gallery, including works by Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek and his descendants, and various painters of the Hague School. The Crocker's holdings of European art after 1900 are small, but include one of Northern California's most significant collections of works by Renoir, in part due to gifts from the artist's grandson, Alain Renoir, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. These include three small bronzes, two terra cotta relief sculptures, a Cagnes landscape painting, and works on paper, and also a ceramic vase by Jean Renoir. Works after 1900 also include two portraits of Crocker family members by Giovanni Boldini."

(Babson had previously designed the home now known as the Leland Stanford Mansion in Sacramento.) In addition, Crocker asked Babson to design an elaborate gallery building that would sit adjacent to the mansion and display the family's growing art collection. Babson saw the home and gallery as an integrated complex, unique in design and demanding the finest materials. The gallery building included a bowling alley, skating rink and billiards room on the ground floor; a natural history museum and a library on the first floor; and gallery space on the second floor. Completed in 1872, the Crocker family mansion and art gallery are considered the masterpieces of Babson's career. The family mansion went through several uses and reconstructions until a 1989 renovation restored the historic fa\u00e7ade and created a modern gallery interior."

During the 1992\u201395 Bosnian War, the town's Serb majority remained in the city while the Bosniaks and Croats were forced to leave their homes. Then in 1995, as the war was nearing its end, the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina seized Bosanski Petrovac and it remained in Bosnian hands until the end of the war. In the following years, the Serbs' right to return would be hindered. However, the town would eventually return to its pre-war ethnic composition."

The focal point is the General store, once a temperance hotel built on pilings and linked to the railway station by a ramp to its second storey. Thomas and Eliza Kilby converted it to a general store in 1906. Their son, Acton, took over the reins in 1922 and inherited the store when Thomas died in 1928. He and his wife Jessie would continue to operate and manage the store until 1977. In 1926, automobiles began to appear at Harrison Mills, and the Kilbys installed gravity-fed gas pumps that served travellers till 1977. In 1973, Acton received a plaque from Imperial Oil, rewarding him for fifty years of service. Situated on a flood plain, the General Store and other buildings were elevated and connected with boardwalks. Today, visitors can see a fascinating gallery of store products and enjoy firsthand involvement with the intriguing artefacts of the farm and its current livestock."

After the 1923 season, East Bengal Club owners were in the lookout for a club ground of their own where the team can play their matches. According to the existing rule of the maidan, two clubs used to share one common ground. Club's founders and then vice-presidents, Shri Sureshchandra Choudhury and Raybahadur Taritbhushan Ray came to learn that Mohun Bagan shared its ground with National Association, which by that time had ceased to exist. They referred this discrepancy to the police authorities and subsequently demanded the share for East Bengal. It was then that Police Commissioner Charles Tegart ordered Mohun Bagan to share its ground with East Bengal. This sudden decision enraged the Mohun Bagan officials. However, despite their protests, East Bengal Club got the ground for their own in 1924, which they co-shared with their arch-rivals Mohun Bagan until 1963, when finally Mohun Bagan moved out to their own Mohun Bagan Ground. In those days, the goalposts were placed East-West and East Bengal took possession of the half towards the Red Road. Another century old Kolkata club, Aryan F.C. started sharing the club ground since then."

In this document the fort is called Castrum Grisiniana. In 1238 Gro\u017enjan was the property of Vicardo I Pietrapalosa. In 1286, Gro\u017enjan fort was lent to the Aquileian patriarch during war with Venice but changed sides in 1287 and Gro\u017enjan was given to Venice. Vicardo's son Pietro inherited Gro\u017enjan after his father's death in 1329, and when he died in 1339 it again became the patriarch's property. The patriarch rented it to a Friulian noble family, de Castello. In 1354 Gro\u017enjan's new owner became Volrich, or Ulrich, Reifenberg, who in 1358 sold it to Venice for 4,000 ducats in order to pay his debts. Volrich was a son of Deitalm, a descendant of Aquileian patriarch Volcher, and in 1356, during the war between Venice and Hungary, his army, entrenched in Gro\u017enjan, strongly resisted the Hungarian army. Yet it seems that at the same time Volrich negotiated the surrendering of Gro\u017enjan in Venice."

In 1359 the Umag captain Pietro Dolfin moved to his new residence in Gro\u017enjan, and in 1360 and 1367 he fortified the town walls and renovated the palace. Captain's Office moved from Gro\u017enjan to Raspo in 1394, when a central rule was established for the whole area. Since then Gro\u017enjan was governed by Venetian noblemen who were given the title of \"Mayor\". From the early 16th century Gro\u017enjan's mayors were chosen among Koper noblemen. In the 15th century judicial duties were performed by the Pietrapelosas, and in 1446 the town walls were fortified in order to protect it from possible Turkish attacks. After the terrible plague in 1630 the Gro\u017enjan area became almost completely deserted. In order to revitalize the area the St. Mark's Republic brought Italian families from Veneto and Friuli; these were mostly tradesmen who settled in towns. Settlers were invited by the Republic of Venice to cultivate the abandoned land in some hamlets around Gro\u017enjan. Most of the settlers were Morlachs from Dalmatia, but also Slavic people, Albanians and Greeks, all refugees of the Ottoman Empire. All settlers in Istria were given free land and were exempt from fiscal duties and work obligations for twenty years; the only condition was to cultivate the land within five years. Economic success of colonization of villages reflected on the towns as well: trade and transportation developed and demographics improved."

In 1816 the Austrian Emperor Francis II visited Gro\u017enjan on his tour through Istria and met with the local clergy and population. During Austrian rule the Gro\u017enjan area flourished. Building of the Parenzana railroad in 1902 enhanced development of trade and agriculture. Wine, olive oil, eggs and other produce were sold in Koper and Trieste. According to the 1910 census, the settlement of Gro\u017enjan had 1,658, and the municipal area 4,028 inhabitants. The town had a doctor, a post office, a school, a lawyer, notary public, oil processing plant, bakery, groceries and clothing stores, two butchers, several inns and various trade shops (shoemakers, blacksmiths, tailors, carpenters, etc.)."

In 1975 the Treaty of Osimo divided the Free Territory of Trieste and Gro\u017enjan became part of Yugoslavia. The London Memorandum provided the population with the option of emigration to Italy. The new Yugoslavia's emergent communist system and its application, along with lingering hostilities between Italians and Yugoslavs (like the murder of priest Francesco Bonifacio), contributed to a large wave of emigration (part of the Istrian\u2013Dalmatian exodus). By April 1956, 2/3 of the population emigrated from the area to Italy. In 1955 Gro\u017enjan lost its municipality status and became part of the municipality of Buje. In 1965, when the Town of Arts was founded, some of the housing was given to artists from Croatia, Slovenia and Vojvodina, and some were assigned to the Cultural Centre of the International Music Youth Federation in 1969. In 1993 Gro\u017enjan got its municipality status again."

Carter of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Savannah Office  issued a survey report that recommended the construction of dams on the Savannah River in order to prevent flooding in Augusta, Georgia. His report was overlooked until the 1927 Rivers and Harbors Act allowed the USACE to investigate development of the Savannah River for the purpose of hydroelectricity, navigation, flood control, and irrigation. In 1933, the USACE completed its report for the entire Savannah River Basin and recommended against government flood control development of the basin but proposed two hydropower dams in the upper Savannah Basin, the Hartwell and Clark Hill dams. The Flood Control Act of 1950 authorized the Hartwell Dam and Reservoir as a development project of the Savannah River Basin. Construction on the dam began in 1955 and the plan called for a three-mile long structure containing four hydroelectric generators with a combined 264\u00a0MW capacity. Predicting future demand requirements, the ability to install a fifth generator in the future was provided. Of the dam's length, 1,900\u00a0ft is a concrete gravity dam, the rest being compacted earth. A year before its completion, in February 1961, the dam began to inundate a portion of the Savannah River to create the reservoir. In March 1962, the reservoir was complete behind the dam and the four original hydro-power generators went online in April. The original projected cost of the dam was US$68.4 million but when completed was just over US$89.2 million. In 1983, the fifth generator was installed on the dam, raising the generation capacity to 344\u00a0MW."

It was originally located near 23rd Street, adjacent to Chelsea Piers and Hudson River Park. It had been purchased from a used car salesman in Staten Island by John Krevey in October 1996 and delivered by a tugboat. This barge formerly carried railroad boxcars across the Hudson River before the advent of containerized freight or tunnels beneath the river.  The land side of Pier 63 was formerly used as a freight transfer station for the Baltimore and Ohio railroad where freight was moved from the boxcars on the barges to local conveyance. In the spring of 2007 the barge was relocated from 23rd Street to Pier 66A at 26th Street, on the Hudson River, and was renamed Pier 66 Maritime. The barge currently has an Erie Lackawanna caboose on display. Two historical boats were primarily located here: the lightvessel Frying Pan and the fireboat John J. Harvey. On the same Pier 66A, there are storage facilities for kayaks, as well as a dock to launch. New York Water Taxi once had a stop on the Pier. John Krevey, who ran Pier 66 Maritime, died on February 4, 2011.

The highway runs for  across mostly rural areas from an intersection with NY\u00a078 and NY\u00a098 in the Wyoming County town of Java to a junction with NY\u00a031 near the city of Lockport in Niagara County. It connects to several of the region's major east\u2013west roads, including U.S. Route\u00a020 (US\u00a020) and the New York State Thruway (Interstate\u00a090 or I-90). In southwestern Genesee County, the route takes on added importance as it provides the most direct route between the Thruway and Darien Lake, Western New York's largest amusement park. The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to the portion of its modern routing north of US\u00a020A. Over the next 30 years, NY\u00a077 was truncated and extended several times, moving the south end of the route to various locations in Wyoming and Genesee counties.

        "content": "NY\u00a077 begins at a somewhat complicated four-way intersection with NY\u00a078 and NY\u00a098 in Java Center, a hamlet within the Wyoming County town of Java. Here, NY\u00a078 heads east\u2013west through the junction while NY\u00a098 enters the intersection from the south and turns to follow NY\u00a078 east toward an area known as Five Corners. NY\u00a077, meanwhile, continues due north on the path set by NY\u00a098 south of this point. The highway gradually descends through the open fields of Wyoming County, loosely paralleling the Arcade and Attica Railroad for  to the railroad's end outside of North Java. Past this point, NY\u00a077 heads into the town of Sheldon, where it crosses US\u00a020A near the northern town line. In the adjacent town of Bennington, the route serves the small hamlet of the same name, situated around NY\u00a077's junction with NY\u00a0354. North of Bennington hamlet, the highway traverses some swampy areas on its way into Genesee County, where it crosses the Norfolk Southern Railway's Southern Tier Line at a grade crossing just south of the Darien hamlet of Darien Center. In the small community, located southeast of Darien Lakes State Park, NY\u00a077 intersects the cross-state US\u00a020. Not far to the north of Darien Center is Darien Lake, a sprawling amusement park located on the east side of the highway. The road, however, remains a two-lane highway as it continues north to the town of Pembroke and the village of Corfu, where it intersects NY\u00a033. NY\u00a077 crosses another major east\u2013west route, NY\u00a05, at a junction  north of Corfu known locally as Brick House Corners. Just beyond that junction, the truck stops and toll plaza associated with exit\u00a048A of the New York State Thruway (I-90) come into view as the road dips slightly in elevation. After connecting to the Thruway's toll plaza, the highway makes its first major bend, turning northeast to pass over the Thruway. Past the Thruway, it once again continues in a more northerly fashion to the hamlet of Indian Falls, a community located on the northern bank of the Tonawanda Creek. NY\u00a077 crosses the creek here, and the falls that give the hamlet its name are visible from the road. North of the falls, the surrounding land becomes mostly fields once again as the route resumes a due north alignment into the town of Alabama. At the small hamlet of Basom, NY\u00a077 intersects Bloomingdale Road, a local road serving the nearby Tonawanda Indian Reservation that was once part of NY\u00a0267. Not far from Basom, NY\u00a063 comes in from the east and turns north onto NY\u00a077, starting the only concurrency along the latter route. This ends  further north in the hamlet of Alabama, where NY\u00a077 turns to the west as NY\u00a063 takes over the northbound route. The portion of NY\u00a077 from NY\u00a063 to the Niagara County line is maintained by Genesee County as part of CR\u00a012, which continues east of NY\u00a063 along Lewiston, Lockport and North Byron Roads to CR\u00a07 northeast of the village of Elba. This section of NY\u00a077 is the only part that is not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). West of NY\u00a063, NY\u00a077 follows Lewiston Road northwest along the southwestern edge of Oak Orchard Swamp and the Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge. As it heads into Niagara County, NY\u00a077 continues to trend slightly northward, running along the northern fringe of the Tonawanda Wildlife Management Area. About  northwest of the county line is the hamlet of McNalls, which served as the southern terminus of the 1930s incarnation of NY\u00a0359. The route continues on to the eastern suburbs of the city of Lockport, where NY\u00a077 ends at an intersection with NY\u00a031 near the community of Nottingham Estates."

On March\u00a01, 1921, the spur became part of an extended Route\u00a020. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route\u00a020 west of Rochester was designated as part of NY\u00a03. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY\u00a03 was realigned between Lockport and Gasport to follow modern NY\u00a031. Its former routing from Lockport to McNalls became part of NY\u00a077, a new route assigned in the renumbering that began at US\u00a020 (now US\u00a020A) in Sheldon and passed through Corfu, Alabama, and McNalls on its way to NY\u00a03 in Lockport. NY\u00a077 was extended south to Arcade , following its modern alignment to Java Center and overlapping with NY\u00a098 (via Chaffee and Curriers Roads, both part of NY\u00a098 at the time) between Java Center and Arcade. The extension was short-lived, however, as NY\u00a077 was truncated northward to NY\u00a033 in Corfu . Around the same time, NY\u00a098 was realigned to use East Arcade Road between Arcade and NY\u00a078 in Java. NY\u00a077 was reextended southward to Java Center in the late 1950s and along modern NY\u00a098 to the junction of Cattaraugus and East Arcade Roads (the latter then part of NY\u00a098) near Arcade . NY\u00a098 was realigned in the early 1960s to follow NY\u00a077 between Arcade and Java Center, resulting in the truncation of NY\u00a077 back to Java Center once again."

The oldest mention of the tavern comes from 1727, and the Wawer colony was established in 1838. First settlers appeared in 1839. During the November Uprising, the first and second Wawer battles took place here in early 1831. On the night of 26/27 December 1939 German occupants committed the Wawer massacre. In 1951, Wawer was incorporated into Warsaw. In 1960, Wawer was incorporated into the Praga Po\u0142udnie district. In 1994 Wawer reappeared on the map of Warsaw as a commune (Warsaw - Wawer).

In the 1930s it was further enlarged and improved, and its name was changed to Istituto Universitario Navale. It played a strategic role during Fascism: the University experts elaborated and calculated the exact and best air routes for the Oceanic trips performed by the Royal Italian Sea Planes, the \"Trasvolata Atlantica\". Several airplanes, leaving their base in Orbetello, arrived to New York City and, in a second trip, finally come to South America: it was a great technological and political success for the regime. Also, it was at the Istituto Universitario Navale that, during World War II, some scientist developed and realized the first Italian radar; unfortunately the political authorities did not understand the importance of such discovery, stopping the development and thus neglecting the possibility to produce such an instrument."

Gaspar de Portol\u00e0, a Spanish explorer, came to the area in 1769, which led to the establishment of forts, missions and cattle herds. The King of Spain parceled out land for missions and private use. After Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government secularized the missions and assumed control of the lands. It began distributing the land to Mexican citizens who applied for grants. Three large Spanish/Mexican grants made up the land that later became the Irvine Ranch: Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, Rancho San Joaquin and Rancho Lomas de Santiago. In 1864, Jose Andres Sepulveda, owner of Rancho San Joaquin, sold  to Benjamin and Thomas Flint, Llewellyn Bixby and James Irvine for $18,000 to resolve debts due to the Great Drought. In 1866, Irvine, Flint and Bixby acquired  Rancho Lomas de Santiago for $7,000. After the Mexican-American war the land of Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana fell prey to tangled titles. In 1868, the ranch was divided among three claimants as part of a lawsuit: Flint, Bixby and Irvine. The ranches were devoted to sheep grazing. However, in 1870, tenant farming was permitted. In 1878, James Irvine acquired his partners' interests for $150,000 ($ in  dollars ). His  stretched  from the Pacific Ocean to the Santa Ana River. James Irvine died in 1886. The ranch was inherited by his son, James Irvine II, who incorporated it into the Irvine Company. James Irvine II shifted the ranch operations to field crops, olive and citrus crops. In 1888, the Santa Fe Railroad extended its line to Fallbrook Junction, north of San Diego, and named a station along the way after James Irvine. The town that formed around this station was named Myford, after Irvine's son, because a post office in Calaveras County already bore the family name. The town was renamed Irvine in 1914. By 1918,  of lima beans were grown on the Irvine Ranch. Two Marine Corps facilities, MCAS El Toro and MCAS Tustin, were built during World War II on ranch land sold to the government. James Irvine II died in 1947 at the age of 80. His son, Myford, assumed the presidency of the Irvine Company. He began opening small sections of the Irvine Ranch to urban development. The Irvine Ranch played host to the Boy Scouts of America's 1953 National Scout Jamboree. Jamboree Road, a major street which now stretches from Newport Beach to the city of Orange, was named in honor of this event. David Sills, then a young Boy Scout from Peoria, Illinois, was among the attendees at the 1953 Jamboree. Sills came back to Irvine as an adult and went on to serve four terms as the city's mayor. Myford Irvine died in 1959. The same year, the University of California asked the Irvine Company for  for a new university campus. The Irvine Company sold the requested land for $1 and later the state purchased an additional . William Pereira, the university's consulting architect, and the Irvine Company planners drew up master plans for a city of 50,000 people surrounding the new university. The plan called for industrial, residential and recreational areas, commercial centers and greenbelts. The new community was to be named Irvine; the old agricultural town of Irvine, where the railroad station and post office were located, was renamed East Irvine. The first phases of the villages of Turtle Rock, University Park, Westpark (then called Culverdale), El Camino Real, and Walnut were completed by 1970. On December 28, 1971, the residents of these communities voted to incorporate a substantially larger city than the one envisioned by the Pereira plan. By January 1999, Irvine had a population of 134,000 and a total area of . In the 1970s, the mayor was Bill Vardoulis. After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, a large influx of Vietnamese refugees settled in nearby Fountain Valley, especially in the late 1970s and throughout the 80s, forming a large percentage of Asian Americans in the city. In late 2003, after a ten-year-long legal battle, Irvine annexed the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. This added  of land to the city and blocked an initiative championed by Newport Beach residents to replace John Wayne Airport with a new airport at El Toro.  Most of this land has become part of the Orange County Great Park."

        "content": "Los Angeles architect William Pereira and Irvine Company employee Raymond Watson designed Irvine's layout, which is nominally divided into townships called \"villages\", separated by six-lane streets. Each township contains houses of similar design, along with commercial centers, religious institutions, and schools. Commercial districts are checker-boarded in a periphery around the central townships. Pereira originally envisioned a circular plan with numerous artificial lakes and the university in the center. When the Irvine Company refused to relinquish valuable farmland in the flat central region of the ranch for this plan, the university site was moved to the base of the southern coastal hills. The design that ended up being used was based on the shape of a necklace (with the villages strung along two parallel main streets, which terminate at University of California, Irvine (UCI), the \"pendant\"). Residential areas are now bordered by two commercial districts, the Irvine Business Complex to the west (part of the South Coast Plaza\u2013John Wayne Airport edge city) and Irvine Spectrum to the east. Traces of the original circular design are still visible in the layout of the UCI campus and the two artificial lakes at the center of Woodbridge, one of the central villages. All streets have landscaping allowances. Rights-of-way for powerlines also serve as bicycle corridors, parks, and greenbelts to tie together ecological preserves. The city irrigates the greenery with reclaimed water. The homeowners' associations which govern some village neighborhoods exercise varying degrees of control on the appearances of homes. In more restrictive areas, houses' roofing, paint colors, and landscaping are regulated. Older parts of the Village of Northwood that were developed beginning in the early 1970s independently of the Irvine Company, have the distinction of being a larger village that is not under the purview of a homeowners' association. As a result, homeowners in the older Northwood areas do not pay a monthly village association fee; its neighborhoods are generally not as uniform in appearance as those in other villages, such as Westpark and Woodbridge. However, the more tightly regulated villages generally offer more amenities, such as members-only swimming pools, tennis courts, and parks. In addition to association dues, homeowners in villages developed in the 1980s and later may be levied a Mello-Roos special tax, which came about in the post-Proposition 13 era. For homeowners in these areas, the association dues coupled with the Mello-Roos special tax may add significantly to the cost of living in the city."

Appleby appears three times in the Domesday Book, with Appleby Magna (listed as Aplebi and Apleby) and Appleby Parva (listed as Apleberie) recorded separately. Appleby Magna is listed as partly in Derbyshire and partly in Leicestershire, where Appleby Parva is listed as being in Leicestershire Both have shifted across the borders several times but have been part of Leicestershire since 1897. Appleby Parva is listed in the Doomsday Book as under the lordship of Robert de Ferrers, 1st Earl of Derby, who held it under his father Henry de Ferrers, a French Nobleman and companion of William I. The Hamlet is valued at \u00a30.5, with a taxable value of 1 Geld Unit, and a population of 4 households and 4 freeman. The hamlet is thought to have been relatively undeveloped until prior to the Norman Invasion of 1066; the land sits at the bottom of a hill and is poorly drained, so was not cultivated by the Saxons or Danes: the settlement only began to properly develop under its new French Lord, post-1066.  There is thought to have been some local ethnic divide, with Appleby Magna (owned by Burton Abbey and Lady Godiva) inhabited by primarily Anglo-Saxon villagers, and Appleby Parva inhabited by a small group of Normans."

        "content": "The land of the hamlet was then leased to farmers until in the 1600s, the Manor of Appleby Parva was purchased by the Moore Family. The family held no formal titles, but were known locally as Squires. The most famous member of the family was Sir John Moore. As second (and thus non-inheriting) son, he went to London to make his own fortune, becoming a merchant, an MP, and later Lord Mayor and Alderman of London. He contributed large sums to the erection of schools at Christ's Hospital, and founded a free grammar school in Appleby Magna, now called Sir John Moore Church of England Primary School. He died aged 81, on 2 June 1702, leaving his estates, worth \u00a380,000 (\u00a36,247,200 today), to his two nephews living in Appleby Parva. The family came to own much of the land in the Parish of Appleby Magna, as well as Snarestone Lodge in a neighbouring village, Kentwell Hall in Suffolk and land in (and the Lordship of) Bentley, Warwickshire. The direct line of the Moores as lords of the manor failed three times, and the family were not in constant occupation. The land of the hamlet enclosed by the Moores in the 18th Century. George Moore, who inherited in 1813, was a pioneer in agricultural techniques. As previously mentioned, much of the hamlet was poorly drained, waterlogged and prone to flooding, especially in the winter months.  George sought to improve this. He is described by John Nichols as \"the first introducer of the improved system of watering grass-lands in this country\".  George had previously won a gold medal, for under-draining land, from the Society of Arts in the year 1794. The Moore's demolished the existing manor house in 1770; they constructed another house on the site known as Appleby House but were not in constant occupation. Appleby House was extended to create Appleby Hall between 1832 and 1838. The late medieval settlement pattern was largely obliterated by the construction of Appleby Hall, as older surrounding properties were demolished and 'New Road' was built to replace the earlier road that passed by the front of the house; so creating a private garden and parkland around the house, which was then landscaped. New carriage ways were built, as were gatehouses (which still exist today). By the 1880s the Moores family's fortunes had turned: The Agricultural slump caused revenues to fall sharply.  The family initially tried to save the estate by searching for coal: The Appleby Magna Colliery Company was formed in the 1870s but failed to find any workable coal seams. Attempts were made to cut expenses by demolishing several of the family's ancillary and dower homes, but they were ultimately forced to put Appleby Hall and its estate up for sale: the quire then retired to Witchingham Hall in Norfolk. The estate ran to 4,500 acres and included land in many of the neighbouring villages; however, attempts to sell failed.  Several farms were auctioned in 1888 and 1889. Squire George John Moore returned to Appleby Hall in 1891 and, despite his financial situation, continued to live an extravagant lifestyle with numerous household staff.  With insufficient income, ends were met by the repeated sales of farms and land.  George John died in 1916 and his son Charles L G Moore inherited the Hall and estate (now less than 2400 acres). In 1918 the estate was no longer viable and Charles looked to sell.  In 1919 he forced an ultimatum on his tenant farmers: they would have to give him 10 shillings more rent per acre, or he would be forced to sell (a rise of between 32% and 50%).  The farmers initially agreed, but later reneged, thinking he was bluffing and doubting he would actually sell the estate the family had lived in for 300 years. Charles had, however, already received an offer and the house was sold to property speculators. The rest of the estate was auctioned on Thursday 20 November 1919 at the Royal Hotel, Ashby de la Zouch.  The estate was divided into 49 lots comprising a total of 2786 acres, and included 12 farms, 22 small holdings, 2 inns and about 50 cottages. With the estate sold, Charles retired to Devon where he died in 1961. The farms and small holdings were mainly sold to their tenants. After being sold, Appleby Hall was stripped of its valuable materials (interiors and lead roof) and had been completely demolished by 1930; only the gatehouses and part of the stables building remained."

        "content": "In Roman times the reclaimed area which is now Canvey Island was joined to the mainland by a road  providing access from Benfleet at low tides to Camulodunum (Colchester) and Londinium (London).  The A130 road from Sadlers Farm roundabout to Canvey Island follows the route of the original Roman road.  Its construction in 1971 brought to light a number of artifacts dating back to the early settlements in the area. The name of the town originates from the time of the Saxon settlers in the 5th Century, when the area was largely marshland.  They named the area Beamfleote, meaning \"tree stream\", being the area where the creeks from the River Thames adjoined the wooded area to the north. The current spelling was adopted at the time the railway service was brought to the area and a railway station built for the town.  Throughout the intervening period various documented versions of the names has been 'Benfleota', 'Beamflet', 'Bemflet', 'Bienflet' and 'Bemfleet'.  The last was used on John Norden's maps in the 17th Century. In Saxon times the village became known as South Benfleet when a new settlement, which became known as Little Benfleet,  developed to the north of the original settlement.  The new settlement did not last, and its site, which has since become known as North Benfleet, is now largely rural. The railway was brought to the town in 1855.  The new Benfleet railway station connected the town with Southend-on-Sea to the east and London Fenchurch Street station. In July 2002 Castle Point District Council named a 6-mile cycle way, from near Benfleet railway station to near Leigh-on-Sea railway station, the \"de Neumann Way\" after Captain Peter de Neumann, GM."

This was towards the end of the Saxon period, and the Thames and other waterways made the area vulnerable to Viking attacks. Benfleet was used as a Viking base. However, the Vikings were defeated in the battle by the army of King Alfred under the command of his son Edward the Elder and his son-in-law Earl Aethelred of Mercia. Subsequently a church was built by the Saxons in thanksgiving for the victory over the Vikings. St Mary's is the most recent church building occupying this site and is a Grade I listed building. In December 2008 a sculpture commemorating the battle was erected in Ferry Road, South Benfleet."

Then in 1989, the North Carolina General Assembly created the University of North Carolina Hospitals entity as a unifying organization to govern constituent hospitals. Today, UNC Health consists of UNC Medical Center, Rex Healthcare, Chatham Hospital, Caldwell Memorial Hospital, Johnston Health, Pardee Hospital, Nash Health Care, Wayne Memorial Hospital, UNC Lenoir Health Care and UNC Rockingham Health Care. In addition, UNC Health Care includes UNC Faculty Physicians (the practice group serving UNC Hospitals) and the UNC Physicians Network (a wholly owned subsidiary of UNC Health that owns and operates community-based practices that provide primary and specialty care throughout the North Carolina Triangle area.). UNC Hospitals include the NC Memorial Hospital, NC Children's Hospital, NC Women's Hospital, NC Cancer Hospital (clinical home of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center), and the NC Neurosciences Hospital. Construction of a new $20 million office/hospital complex in Hillsborough, NC began in April 2011. As of July 2015, many services are now offered at the Hillsborough campus, including an emergency department and general surgery. UNC Health and Charlotte-based Atrium Health announced August 31, 2017 that the systems had signed a letter of intent (LOI) to join their clinical enterprises and collaborate to enhance medical education and research. Under the LOI, the two organizations agreed to start a period of exclusive negotiations, with the goal of entering into final agreements by the end of the year. Their goal is to form a new organization through a joint operating company structure. Executives of both systems said a larger network would improve the ability to negotiate with insurance companies and provide other cost reductions. The letter of intent signed August 30, 2017 said that if the proposed partnership was approved, UNC Health Care CEO Bill Roper would become executive chairman and Carolinas Healthcare CEO Gene Woods would be CEO of the new organization. However, questions about who would control the combined system led Atrium to back out of talks in March 2018. On October 25, 2017, Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and High Point Regional Health System announced that Wake Forest Baptist would take over High Point Regional, a part of UNC Health since 2013, by Summer 2018."

The Sayyids of Jarwal were descended from one Abu Talib, who was originally from Iran. During Genghis Khan's invasion, Abu Talib fled with his family, first to Khorasan and then to Lahore. In 1286, his son Aziz ud-Din went to Delhi, and his own son Ala ud-Din eventually settled in Bado Sarai, in Barabanki district. Ala ud-Din had two sons: Jalal ud-Din and Jamal ud-Din. Jalal ud-Din incurred the ire of the Delhi sultan Ghiyath ud-Din Tughluq, who had him executed. Ghiyath ud-Din later tried to make amends to Jamal ud-Din by granting him 25,000 bighas of land, revenue-free, in Barhauli, on the south bank of the Gogra, and another 25,000 in Jarauli on the north bank. While Jamal ud-Din had no trouble establishing himself in Barhauli, he faced stiff resistance from Raja Chhatarsal, the Bhar ruler of Jarauli, and died without taking control of the fort of Jarauli. His son, Sayyid Zakariyya, finally gained control of the fort in 1340, probably because of military support from Muhammad bin Tughluq, who is known to have been in the Bahraich area during that year. In 1800 the Jarwal Sayyids, some of them Shi\u2018is, displaced the Ansari Shaykhs and came to hold 276 out of 365 villages in the parganah, although their holdings thereafter declined rapidly to (a still formidable) 76 villages in 1877. Khateeb-ul-Iman  Maulana Syed Muzaffar Husain Rizvi Tahir Jarwali (1932-Dec 1987) a Shia religious leader was one of the prominent Jarwali Sayyid and celebrated preacher of late 20th century (1970s & 80s), he was also General Secretary of All India Shia Conference for some time."

The neighbourhood contains a few important cultural landmarks, including the world-famous Lisson Gallery, Alfies Antique Market, Red Bus Recording Studios, the former Christ Church, now the Greenhouse Centre, and the Seashell of Lisson Grove. The heart of the community and retail/services zone is Church Street market, which runs between Lisson Grove itself and Edgware Road.The market specialises in antiques and bric-\u00e0-brac, and has flourished since the 1960s. The area saw its suburban decades \u2013 on the edge of London \u2013 from the late 18th century, and some fine Georgian terraces remain. Early residents included artists such as Benjamin Haydon and Charles Rossi, whose former cottage still stands at 116 Lisson Grove. Lord's Cricket Ground adjoined Lisson Grove in the early nineteenth century before re-locating to St Johns Wood, the similar-size district to the north. The area is bounded by St John's Wood Road to the north, Regent's Park to the east, Edgware Road to the west and Marylebone Road to the south. Church Street electoral ward, as currently drawn, is approximately the same. Lisson Grove is predominantly residential, with a mid-to-high population density for Inner London. The Council's profile describes Church Street as an ethnically diverse ward, having one of the highest concentrations of social housing in the borough with a substantial estate renewal programme underway."

In 1810 the Royal Academy catalogues give sculptor Charles Rossi's address as 21 Lisson Grove, where he had bought a large house. By 1817, Rossi was renting out a section of the house to painter Benjamin Haydon. A blue plaque on the corner of Rossmore Road and Lisson Grove marks the spot and in 2000 author Penelope Hughes-Hallett wrote The Immortal Dinner with the focus on Haydon's dining companions invited to his Lisson Grove abode on 28 December 1817. Haydon's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Edwin Landseer lived north on Lisson Grove on the corner of St John's Wood Road from 1825. The arrival of Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema at nearby 44, Grove End Road in the late 1870s inspired the naming of one of the Lilestone Estate apartment blocks built in the 1920s as Tadema House. Eastlake House, opposite Tadema House, is possibly named for Charles Eastlake whose Eastlake movement's underlying ethos of simple decorative devices that were affordable and easy to keep clean would have been of interest to those developing social housing in the 20th Century. On Bell Street, the Lisson Gallery, established in 1967 by Nicholas Logsdail, championed the new British sculptors of the 1980s and continues to show new and established artists, with expanded premises further along Bell Street. Mark Jason Gallery at \u2116 1 Bell Street specialises in promoting contemporary British and international artists. At \u2116 17, Bell Street Vintage Wireless London has existed since 1979, selling a wide assortment of vintage turntables, radiograms, wirelesses, dansettes, reel-to-reels, amps and mikes. In 2006 the Subway Gallery arrived in the Joe Strummer Subway which runs under the Marylebone Road. Conceived by artist Robert Gordon McHarg III, the space itself is a 1960s kiosk with glass walls which creates a unique showcase for art, interacting naturally with passers by, visitors and the local community. The Show Room is on Penfold Street, next to the main Aeroworks factory. The Show Room is a non-profit space for contemporary art that is focused on a collaborative and process-driven approach to production, be that artwork, exhibitions, discussions, publications, knowledge and relationships.

        "content": "In the Domesday Book the settlement is referred to as Collingtrev or Colentreu, Colen being Celtic for place and trev possibly meaning 'tree' or trough. Others think that Colen is a version of St Columba to whom the village church was dedicated in 1170. In the 15th century the village is referred to as Colyngtrowgh and in the 17th century as Collingtrough. The trough is certainly the basis for the name of the main road, Watering Lane, from the A45 up to the crossroads at the centre of the village. Cattle and steam engines collected water from the spring here. In 2006 its site was revealed when undergrowth was cleared back from the side of the road and the Parish Council decided to make a feature of it. A more likely explanation for the name is in a 2008 document from the borough council dealing with conservation. This mentions that: \"Collingtree probably had Saxon origins\" and that its name is thought to be derived from \"Cola's tree\", after an Anglo-Saxon leader's name and a notable tree, possibly a boundary tree. The centre of Collingtree was designated a Conservation Area in 1978. In 2008, the borough council asked for comments on a draft Re-appraisal and Management Plan for the Conservation Area. The proposed changes to the area are to expand the work to preserve the history and character of the village. The historic 17th- to 19th-century buildings, the 10 listed buildings, the layout of boundary walls and the use of local stone, combine to create a distinctive location with a strong sense of place, worthy of protection and enhancement. The Management Plan outlines how to protect the historic character and actively manage the area, including preserving the existing character through to the control of advertisements and the monitoring of change. The village has one of the most unusual High Streets in the country. It runs roughly north to south, has a pub, The Wooden Walls of Old England, but no shops and leads nowhere in either direction. The village grew on a route between Blisworth in the south and Wootton in the north. The southbound route was cut off in the 1950s by the building of the M1 motorway. The northern part was cut off when Collingtree Grange was built and is now cut off by the golf course. The oldest houses are 17th-century, of which four are listed, all in the High Street. No.43 is Grade II* listed. Another five listed buildings, in the High Street and Barn Corner are 18th-century. The form of the village is largely unchanged since about 1800 or earlier. An application by the company Bovis to build 1,000 houses close to the village in East Hunsbury was proposed in 2014. It was rejected by the Northampton Borough Council as it would affect the setting of the village and the Conservation Area. When the area was designated in 1978 it was intended to ensure that any changes which take place harmonise with the existing area.... At the time of writing, the application has been called in by the Secretary of State. Collingtree and East Hunsbury are supporting the borough council and defending its position. An application to build a large complex of warehouses and a rail freight terminal on the south site of the M1 adjacent to Collingtree was strongly opposed and finally withdrawn after strong opposition from Collingtree and other local parishes."

In 2013 a large two million sq foot warehouse was proposed along a large section of the south side of the M1 at Collingtree with a formal planning application in December 2014. The application is strongly opposed by local residents and eventually abandoned. The development was in the area of South Northamptonshire Council and was specifically excluded from development in the local plan."

Despite a peace treaty which had been signed between the peasants and the city of Bern, on May 30, 1653, Z\u00fcrich assembled an army under the command of Conrad Werdm\u00fcller with the task to break any armed resistance once and for all times. Some 8,000 men with 800 horses and 18 cannons marched towards the Aargau. Already three days later, Werdm\u00fcller's army controlled the important crossing of the river Reuss at Mellingen. In the hills around the nearby villages of Wohlenschwil and Othmarsingen a peasant army of some 24,000 men assembled, led by Leuenberger and Schybi. A peasant delegation tried to negotiate with Werdm\u00fcller, showing him the peace treaty concluded with Bern. Werdm\u00fcller, who had been until then unaware of this treaty that had been signed only days before, refused to acknowledge the validity of the contract and demanded the unconditional surrender of the peasants. Thus rebutted, the peasants attacked Werdm\u00fcller's troops on June 3, 1653, but being poorly equipped and lacking any artillery, they were defeated decisively in the Battle of Wohlenschwil. The peasants were forced to agree to the peace of Mellingen, which annulled the Huttwil League. The peasant troops returned home and an amnesty was declared, except for the leaders of the movement."

        "content": "The earliest signs of a settlement in Oberlunkhofen are scattered Bronze Age items.  In Schalchmatthau there is the foundation of a rectangular Roman era farm with a portico and flanked by two wings.  Also from the Roman era, there is a 1-3rd Century villa and a bathhouse with heated rooms.  Near the villa, an Alemanni graveyard was also discovered.  During initial excavation, the wall remains were uncovered in 1897-98.  Then, between 1975-80 the wall ruins were preserved. The modern village of Oberlunkhofen is first mentioned in the 9th Century as Lunchunft though this record comes from an 11th Century copy of the original, older document.  In 1232 it was mentioned as Lunchuft and in 1309 as obern Lunchuft.  There was a castle near the village, but no surviving records mention it.  It was presumably destroyed in 1386. The village was owned by St. Leodegar in Lucerne which was under the jurisdiction of Murbach Abbey and was sold in 1291 to the House of Habsburg.  In the early 14th Century is a center of the Habsburg region of Kelleramt.  The rights to the low justice and the vogtei fell on Bremgarten in 1414.  In 1415, the rights to high justice went to Zurich.  In 1797 Bremgarten sold the village to the other four municipalities of the Kelleramt.  In 1798 it became part of the short-lived Helvetic Republic Canton of Baden. St. Leodegar, the parish church of the Kelleramt, was first mentioned in 1185. The church was under the jurisdiction of St. Leodegar in Lucerne and then Murbach Abbey.  In 1291 it went to the Habsburgs, and in 1403 was awarded Muri Abbey which held it until 1841.  The parish included Oberlunkhofen, Unterlunkhofen, Arni, Islisberg and Rottenschwil.  The current parish church was built in 1685 on the site of a 1515 church building.  The oldest church building on that site probably dates from the 10th Century. Until the 20th Century the major industries were agriculture and viticulture.  In 1920 the bus line Oberlunkhofen-Jonen-Affoltern am Albis opened.  Then in 1930 the line Birmenstorf-Oberlunkhofen opened.  This line expanded in 1966 Zurich-Wiedikon.  The increase in population after 1980 is due people moving away from the Zurich agglomeration."

Its main section was completed in 1863, with the east wing, built in 1930, being the newest portion. The Italian renaissance style building was designed by William Thomas, a Toronto architect who built prominent structures across Canada, and built by George Lang. The building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1969.  It was also listed as a Provincially Registered Property under Nova Scotia's Heritage Property Act in 1983. The Supreme Court sat for the first time in the newly built Halifax County courthouse on Spring Garden Road in October 1860.

        "content": "By the 1850s a decision was made to consolidate all the Halifax courts under one roof. After fires razed many downtown buildings during that decade (three major fires destroyed many of the city\u2019s wooden buildings between 1857 and 1861, officials abandoned plans for a wooden structure in favour of a more fireproof option made of stone, to protect the legal records it would house. Following the fires, almost all major buildings were constructed of brick and stone. Built on the grounds of what was then the Governor's Garden, location of the court was as contentious back in the 1850s as location of public buildings it is today. Even when the Spring Garden Courthouse was opened the location remained contentious and lawyers, reported to have \"complained that the building is too far away from the business parts of the city\" and it remained unpopular. Halifax carpenter Henry Hill designed the building and Toronto-based architect William Thomas and Sons were retained and created a palatial structure in sandstone. The building was built by contractor George Lang who also built The Halifax Club and the Welsford-Parker Monument at the Front gate of St Paul's Cemetery. Made from brown stone from Mary's Point New Brunswick and Wallace sandstone from Cumberland County. The Wallace quarry sandstone was also used at Nova Scotia's Province House, Province House in Charlottetown and some Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. It was proclaimed in the 1860 Halifax city directory that the \"court house would do honour to any city in Europe, and cannot be surpassed for architectural beauty by any city of the same size on the continent of America.\" The building's architectural exterior is classic with palladian style that represents stability and strength. Decorative features of the building include use of vermiculation and the carving of, replete with carvings of the faces of snarling lions and stern, bearded men in each key stone of the original building's central arches. Interior architectural features to be noted are the pressed metal ceilings, the elaborate arched doorways, the wood paneling and plaster details in the courtrooms and the entry foyer and staircase. In 1863 gas heat replaced 14 fireplaces that inadequately heated the building. The 14 fireplaces remain today though there are none located in the courtrooms. When originally constructed the Courthouse had two courtrooms, judicial robing and jury rooms, a law library and offices for the prothonotary and registrar of chancery. One of the first occupants was the Sheriff and the office of the Sheriff has remained in the court since. Due to the demand for court space, an addition to the back in the 1881\u201382 added additional courts. Matching wings were erected on either end of the building in 1908 (west wing designed by Herbert E. Gates, architect) and 1930 (east wing) to offer additional courtrooms and office space that are now occupied by the Provincial Crown and Judges' Chambers. Today the court houses six courtrooms, judges chambers, court administration offices, the Provincial Crown and cells that can jail up to 50 prisoners. The historic character of the Courthouse remain today and ongoing renovations and upgrades are designed ensure that they honour the original architecture design while at the same time providing efficient modern-day court functions. The Courthouse has been designated as an historic site of national significance by the Historic Sites and Monument Board."

        "content": "A collision occurred on December 6, 1917 in Halifax Harbour between the vessels, SS Mont-Blanc and SS Imo and resulted in a blast that decimated the district known as Richmond, in the North End of the city. The courthouse suffered $19,000 in damage even though it was farther to the south. At the time, Nova Scotia Supreme Court cases were heard in court room #2 on the second floor, east side of the stairwell. Courtroom #1 (now #4) was used for everything else including Admiralty Court. The walls of the court room itself had sustained some damage and the blown out windows were boarded up. Purportedly, oil lamps were used because the power was out. A judicial inquiry known as the Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry was formed to investigate the causes of the collision. Proceedings began at the courthouse on 13 December 1917, presided over by Justice Arthur Drysdale. The inquiry's report of 4 February 1918 blamed Mont-Blancs captain, Aim\u00e9 Le M\u00e9dec, the ship's pilot, Francis Mackey, and Commander F. Evan Wyatt, the Royal Canadian Navy's chief examining officer in charge of the harbour, gates and anti-submarine defences, for causing the collision. All three men were charged with manslaughter and criminal negligence at a preliminary hearing heard by Stipendiary Magistrate Richard A. McLeod, and bound over for trial. However, a Nova Scotia Supreme Court justice, Benjamin Russell found there was no evidence to support these charges. Mackey was discharged on a writ of habeas corpus and the charges dropped. As the captain and pilot had been arrested on the same warrant, the charges against Le M\u00e9dec were also dismissed. This left only Wyatt to face a grand jury hearing. On 17 April 1918, a jury acquitted him in a trial that lasted less than a day. Drysdale also oversaw the first civil litigation trial, in which the owners of the two ships sought damages from each other. His decision (27 April 1918) found Mont-Blanc entirely at fault. Subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada (19 May 1919), and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (22 March 1920), determined Mont-Blanc and Imo were equally to blame for navigational errors that led to the collision. No party was ever convicted for any crime or otherwise successfully prosecuted for any actions that precipitated the disaster."

Many years ago one of the building's janitors ran terrified and shaken from the room, swearing he had seen a ghost, and vowing never to return to the room again (a promise he reportedly kept).

It was established by an Act of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1691, when each county in the Virginia Colony was directed set aside  of land for a town. Storehouses were to be built for products imported and tobacco to be exported. It was ordered that the county sell half-acre lots for its citizens to inhabit the town. It was located at the mouth of Gray's Creek at the James River across and somewhat downstream from Jamestown. It was probably named for Cobham, in Surrey, England. Cobham was active during the 18th and early 19th centuries, but eventually became one of the Former counties, cities, and towns of Virginia. According to the Surry County Historical Society, \"today there is little evidence of the town, which became mostly farmland.\" The society reports that \"farmers, while plowing the fields, have run into old foundations, as well as finding locks, broken china, and even a long-barreled pistol.\" There is also a Cobham in eastern Albemarle County, Virginia.  It is located at the intersection of Route 22 (Louisa Road) and Route 640 (St. John's Road / Cobham Station Lane), roughly halfway between Charlottesville and Louisa.  The unincorporated community consists of horse farms and homes.  Cobham had a train station until the early 20th Century, and one building remains next to the train tracks, thought to have been a feed store.  The old train station building was moved to another site near Gordonsville where it is used as a home.  The original one-story general store near the tracks was moved about two hundred feet up to Route 22, and with the addition of a two-story building in 1936, served as the Cobham General Store and Post Office until the mid-1990s.  After serving other purposes, such as a tack store and internet business, the building was converted to a home in 2002."

The Rebels remained undefeated until the last game of the season, losing to the Cal Lutheran Kingsmen, 13\u201317, as the Rebels finished their inaugural campaign 8\u20131. The following year, the Rebels played their first game against in-state rival Nevada, losing to the Wolf Pack 28\u201330. UNLV gained revenge, defeating Nevada the following year, 42\u201330, in the first year that the Fremont Cannon was awarded. On September 25, 1971, the Rebels played their first game against a Division I school, when they played Utah State of the Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA), ultimately losing 7\u201327. On October 23, 1971, the Rebels opened their new home, Las Vegas Stadium, against Weber State, losing 17\u201330. At the end of the 1972 season with a disappointing 1\u201310 record, Ireland announced he was stepping down, leaving the Rebels with a 26\u201323\u20131 record. Ireland was replaced by Ron Meyer before the start of the 1973 season and Meyer led the Rebels back to powerhouse status with an 8\u20133 record, including their first victory over a major college opponent, thrashing Marshall 31\u20139. The Rebels continued their strong campaign, breaking the national Division II top-10 and announcing their first All-American, running back Mike Thomas, who ran for the Division II national rushing title with 1,741 and setting nine school records in the process. The Rebels' success continued in 1974 with the only undefeated season in school history, finishing 11\u20130 and ranking second in the national Division II polls, the highest any Rebels football team has ever placed. The Rebels embarked on their first post-season journey in a national quarterfinal against Alcorn State, defeating the Braves 35\u201322 in Las Vegas. The Rebels memorable season ended in the national semifinals in the Grantland Rice Bowl, losing to Delaware 11\u201349. Meyer left the program in 1976 to take the head coaching position at collegiate powerhouse SMU."

        "content": "Former Boise State coach Tony Knap took over the Rebels in 1976, after Ron Meyer's departure. Knap was able to continue the Rebels prior success under Meyer, with a 9\u20133 record, a ranking of 7th in the nation and a berth in the Division II playoffs, ultimately losing to Akron 6\u201327 in the national quarterfinals. After ten years as a Division II independent, the program made the jump to the Division I level in 1978, independent of any conference affiliation. On September 9, the Rebels played their first game as a Division I school, losing to Washington State 7\u201334. The Rebels defeated their first major college opponent away from Las Vegas, with a 33\u20136 victory over Colorado State in Fort Collins. At the end of the season, the Rebels made a trip to Yokohama, Japan to compete against college football powerhouse Brigham Young, losing 28\u201324. Even with the hard end to the season, the Rebels still produced a memorable year, going 7\u20134 in their first campaign at the Division I level. The 1981 season proved to be the last in Knap's tenure at UNLV, as he retired from coaching after a year of accomplishments, including the Rebels' first appearance in the ABC's Regional Game of the Week (a 21\u201345 loss at Wyoming), a 45\u201341 upset of 8th-ranked BYU in Provo, Utah and securing the programs 100th win (27\u201320 at UTEP) in El Paso, Texas. The 1982 season was a big year in UNLV football history as the program hired its fourth head coach, Harvey Hyde and the Rebels became affiliated with a college athletic conference when they joined the Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA). The Rebels first PCAA game was a 27\u201329 loss to Pacific on October 2. It took the entire season before the Rebels won their first conference game, a 42\u201323 victory against Cal State Fullerton on November 27. The Rebels won their first conference championship in 1984 as the Randall Cunningham led Rebels finished 11\u20132, including the program's first trip to a bowl game, a 30\u201313 victory over Toledo in the California Bowl in Fresno, California. Hyde stepped down after the 1985 season and a 5\u20135\u20131 record when the NCAA discovered that several players on the 1983 and 1984 Rebels were ineligible. The Rebels were forced to forfeit their entire 1983 and 1984 seasons, including the California Bowl. Wayne Nunnely became the program's fifth head coach on September 20, 1986 and he coached the Rebels to a 17\u20137 victory over Wisconsin in front of the first sellout crowd in Silver Bowl Stadium history, a then record 32,207 fans. One of Nunnely's key players was Elbert \"Ickey\" Woods, the first Rebel and PCAA running back to win the national Division I rushing title, as he rushed for 1,658 yards and was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the 1988 NFL Draft. 1994 was another memorable season for the Rebels, as wide receiver Randy Gatewood set two single-game receiving records in a 38\u201348 loss to Idaho on September 17. The Rebels then stunned the heavily favored Nevada, 32\u201327 to win a share of the Big West Conference championship, the program's second title (but the first one they were allowed to keep). The Rebels then defeated Central Michigan 52\u201324 in the Las Vegas Bowl on their home field. In 1996, the Rebels along with San Jose State left the Big West Conference and became a member of the heavily expanded Western Athletic Conference. The league announced that it would hold a championship game for the top team in each of the two divisions at the end of each season and that the game would be held at Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas. The Rebels lost their first WAC game, 65\u201317 to Air Force on September 7. The Rebels finally won their first WAC game in a 44\u201342 shootout against San Diego State on November 16, in a game in which freshman quarterback John Denton set an NCAA freshman record for passing yards with 503. Although the Rebels finished 1\u201311, Denton still set ten NCAA freshman records. On October 17, 1998, UNLV played their first overtime game, losing to San Diego State 17\u201320. In 1999, the Rebels finished with the program's first winless season, but had their first consensus First Team All-American in punter Joe Kristosik, who averaged a nationally-best 46.2 yard per punt average."

        "content": "In 1999, the Rebels made headlines, first by leaving the WAC with seven other schools to form the Mountain West Conference, but also by announcing that the program had hired legendary collegiate and professional coach John Robinson as their eighth head coach. The school would repeat its conference hardships in the Mountain West as they lost their conference opener on September 25, 14\u201352 to Utah. The Rebels won their first Mountain West game on October 9, 35\u201332 against Wyoming. Although 1999 was a rough year, a UNLV win in week two featured one of the most improbable endings in college football history. The Rebels trailed on the road against Baylor 24\u201321 with ten seconds left. Baylor had the ball at the UNLV five yard line and UNLV was out of time outs. A kneel down would have given Baylor the victory, but Baylor chose to run the ball, fumbled and UNLV's Kevin Thomas recovered and returned it 99 yards for a touchdown and a 27\u201324 Rebel win. 2000 seemed to be the year in which Rebels football would finally turn around, as the Rebels made numerous gains to become a competitor for the Mountain West crown. The Rebels started by upsetting previously undefeated Air Force 34\u201313 on September 30 in the first time that ABC came to Las Vegas for the Rebels football game. The Rebels then ended a five-game skid to rival Nevada, defeating the Wolf Pack 34\u201313 in front of the largest crowd to see a game in the Battle for Nevada. The season went down to the wire as the Rebels had to pull out a 34\u201332 victory on the road against Hawaii to clinch their third berth in a bowl game. The Rebels were chosen as the Mountain West representative for the Las Vegas Bowl on December 20. The Rebels would continue their undefeated streak in bowl games as they defeated Arkansas 31\u201314 in front of a Las Vegas Bowl record 29,113 fans. They finished the season 8\u20135. Before the start of the 2001 season, the Rebels garnered national accolades as the team was ranked No. 25 in Sports Illustrated's preseason Top 25 and No. 24 in Football Digest's rankings. Quarterback Jason Thomas was named a candidate for the Heisman Trophy, ranking as high as No. 7. Although the Rebels seemed good on paper, the team did not gel and ended the season a disappointing 4\u20137. On October 5, 2002, the Rebels defeated rival Nevada 21\u201317 for Robinson's 200th career coaching victory. Robinson retired after the 2004 season, having led the Rebels to a bowl game and five consecutive victories over rival Nevada. On December 6, 2004, the Rebels hired Utah assistant coach Mike Sanford as the 9th head coach. In his first three years at the helm of the Rebels football program, Sanford failed to win more than two games and had back to back 2\u201310 seasons, finishing last in the Mountain West all three years. Sanford failed to beat Nevada all five years he coached at UNLV. Despite UNLV's troubles the program sent former Rebels Eric Wright and Beau Bell to the NFL draft. The Rebels finished the 2008 season with a 5\u20137 record after starting the season 3\u20131. This was the best win-loss record UNLV had since going 6\u20136 in 2003. It also marked the first time UNLV did not finish last in their division since 2004. Their 23\u201320 victory over No. 15 Arizona State was the first time the Rebels had beaten a ranked opponent since 2003. The 2009 season was a disappointment and it led to Sanford's dismissal as coach. UNLV was picked to finish fifth in the conference, but the team began to fall apart after a surprising loss at Wyoming. That was followed by losses at Nevada, against Brigham Young and Utah, and at Texas Christian and the Air Force Academy \u2014 games in which UNLV was outscored 243\u201381. They rebounded toward the end of the season and finished 5\u20137. After the Air Force loss on November 14, the school announced Sanford's last game as coach would be the season finale against San Diego State. Former Montana head coach Bobby Hauck was named as the 10th head coach on December 21, 2009. Former TCU, Alabama and Texas A&M head coach Dennis Franchione was also interviewed for the position. Before the 2014 Nevada Wolf Pack game, Bobby Hauck announced that he would be stepping down following the conclusion of the 2014 season. On December 10, 2014, the school announced that Tony Sanchez of Bishop Gorman High School would succeed Hauck as the 11th head coach of UNLV. Sanchez announced his completed staff at UNLV on December 22, 2014, which would feature staff members from Nebraska, Colorado, Oregon State, USC, Houston, Georgia State and Bishop Gorman. In 2016, a new domed stadium was proposed and approved for Las Vegas that would be the home to the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) after the team relocated to Las Vegas from Oakland and the Rebels accomplishing UNLV's goal of replacing Sam Boyd Stadium. UNLV had been trying to get Sam Boyd Stadium replaced with a new facility since 2011 but had not found the funding to do so. On September 2, 2017, the UNLV Rebels lost to the Howard University Bison 40\u201343 in Sam Boyd Stadium. Howard, a MEAC FCS opponent, was coached by Mike London, and led at quarterback by freshman Caylin Newton, younger brother of NFL star Cam Newton. As of September 2017, due to high off-shore point spread numbers, Howard's victory against UNLV is the biggest point spread upset in college football history. On November 23, 2019, the UNLV Rebels defeated the San Jose State Spartans in their final home game at Sam Boyd Stadium, 38\u201335, in front of 17,373 fans in attendance. On November 25, 2019, Tony Sanchez and UNLV agreed to part ways, taking effect after the team's final regular season game. He was replaced by Oregon offensive coordinator Marcus Arroyo who was announced as the new head coach of the Rebel football program on December 11, 2019. On October 31, 2020, the Rebels opened their new home, Allegiant Stadium, against Nevada, losing 37\u201319."

Property of 71 acres for the university and roughly 530 acres for the surrounding neighborhood was platted from land owned by pioneer families and sold at half-value to the Methodist Episcopal Church, then owners of Willamette University in Salem. The church planned to sell individual lots through a realty company in University Park to finance the university, but home site sales did not sustain the institution. A financial failure for most of its brief existence, the university closed in 1900. After Portland University closed, the land and buildings were purchased by the Archdiocese of Portland in 1901, and Columbia University opened on the site, later renamed the University of Portland. Public transportation was installed, and industry began to develop in the area. As designers of University Park, Methodist Episcopal officials aligned streets along a northeastsouthwest axis and a northwestsoutheast axis in order to maximize exposure to sunlight. Church officials also chose street names in remembrance not only of institutions of higher learning but also persons and places important to Methodists of the time. As a result, University Park is a neighborhood without an ordinal relationship among streets; therefore, navigation requires knowledge of all streets."

        "content": "The Susquehannocks, an Iroquoian speaking tribe, had their first encounter with Europeans in 1608 when Captain John Smith was exploring the Chesapeake Bay for the English Crown. What the Susquehannock called themselves is unknown, the modern name comes from the name, Sasquesahanough or \"roily water people\", bestowed upon them by Cpt. Smith and his Algonquian interpreter. They made their home by the river and had only one small village (Conestoga), but they were a strong tribe, that controlled trade routes along the river and the upper reaches of the bay. The Susquehannock lived along the river until 1675 when they suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Iroquois. Following this loss they began a period of migration and eventual decline. Five chiefs were murdered in Maryland when they went to a meeting to negotiate a treaty. They migrated to New York in 1677 and intermingled with the Iroquois. They returned to Conestoga in 1697 but left again in the early 18th century when they migrated, again, to Ohio. Some remained behind and became known as Conestogas. They were able to live in Pennsylvania until 1763 when a group of six were slaughtered by the anti-Indian Paxton Boys. The remaining members of the tribe sought protection from the colonial governor and were taken to a workhouse in Lancaster. The Paxton Boys gained entry to the workhouse and murdered fourteen more Indians. Only two Susquehannocks remained in Pennsylvania. They worked the rest of their lives as servants on a farm where they died and were buried bringing about the end of the Susquehannock people in Pennsylvania."

        "content": "Pennsylvania Route 462 (PA 462) is a  east\u2013west state route in York and Lancaster counties in central Pennsylvania. The western terminus is west of York, and the eastern terminus is east of Lancaster. At both ends, PA 462 terminates at U.S. Route 30 (US 30), which follows a mostly freeway alignment parallel to the north between York and Lancaster. The route heads east into York, where it follows the one-way pair of Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound. In York, PA 462 runs concurrent with PA 74 and crosses Interstate 83 Business (I-83 Bus.). East of York, the route becomes a multilane road that has an interchange with I-83 and crosses PA 24. PA 462 continues east through Hallam to Wrightsville and passes through that town before it crosses the Susquehanna River and runs through Columbia. East of here, the route continues through Mountville before reaching the city of Lancaster. In Lancaster, PA 462 is routed on the one-way pair of King Street eastbound and Walnut Street westbound, with the westbound direction concurrent with PA 23. The route crosses US 222/PA 272 and northbound PA 72 in Lancaster. East of Lancaster, PA 462 becomes a multilane road again and continues to its eastern terminus. The section of the current route east of Lancaster was built as a turnpike called the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike in 1794, which headed east to Philadelphia. By 1796, a road continued west from Lancaster across the Susquehanna River to York. The state took over the turnpike in the beginning of the 20th century. In 1913, the road between York and Lancaster was incorporated into the Lincoln Highway, an auto trail that ran from San Francisco east to New York City. The Lincoln Highway through Pennsylvania became PA 1 in 1924. US 30 was designated concurrent with PA 1 west of Philadelphia in 1926, with the PA 1 designation removed two years later. US 30 was widened into a multilane road between York and Lancaster in the 1930s. The route was moved to one-way pairs in Lancaster in the 1930s, following King Street eastbound and Orange Street westbound, and York in the 1950s, following Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound. In 1967, US 30 was moved to a freeway bypass between Prospect Road east of Columbia and east of Lancaster, with the former alignment becoming PA 462. US 30 was realigned to a freeway between York and Columbia in 1972 and PA 462 was extended west along the former alignment to west of York. In the 1970s, westbound PA 462 was moved from Orange Street to Walnut Street in Lancaster."

        "content": "The western terminus of PA 462 is at a trumpet interchange with US 30 in West Manchester Township, York County, where US 30 heads east on a freeway and west on at-grade West Market Street. From this interchange, PA 462 heads northeast on four-lane divided West Market Street through commercial areas, soon narrowing to a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The road passes between industrial areas to the northwest and residential neighborhoods to the southeast before it crosses a York Railway line at-grade. The route runs past businesses and comes to an intersection with the eastern terminus of PA 234. PA 462 narrows to two lanes and heads east past homes, coming to a junction with the western terminus of PA 182 in the community of Kurtz Place. The road enters the borough of West York and is lined with more residences along with a few businesses. Farther east, the route becomes the border between West Manchester Township to the north and West York to the south as it passes to the south of the York Fairgrounds, crossing the York Railway tracks again at-grade. PA 462 continues into the city of York and passes residential and commercial development as a four-lane undivided road, reaching a junction with PA 74. At this point, PA 462 becomes concurrent with PA 74 and the road splits into a city-maintained one-way pair, with the eastbound direction following West Market Street, which is two-way and two lanes wide, and the westbound direction following West Philadelphia Street, which carries two lanes of one-way traffic westbound. The two routes follow the one-way pair through urban residential areas of rowhomes with a few businesses, with West Market Street becoming three lanes wide with two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane. PA 74/PA 462 cross over the Codorus Creek and the York County Heritage Rail Trail before intersecting a York Railway line at-grade at Pershing Avenue. Past this intersection, the routes head into the commercial downtown of York, with West Market Street carrying two lanes of eastbound traffic and West Philadelphia Street carrying two lanes of westbound traffic. PA 74/PA 462 intersects I-83 Bus. (George Street) at Continental Square eastbound and near the York County Courthouse westbound.

PA 462 continues east through urban residential areas along the one-way pair. The route crosses a York Railway line at-grade in a commercial area before it runs northeast past more homes and a few businesses. At Harrison Street, westbound PA 462 returns to eastbound PA 462 along East Market Street. PA 462 continues east along state-maintained, four-lane undivided East Market Street out of York into Spring Garden Township, running through wooded suburban residential areas in the community of Elmwood. The route comes to an interchange with I-83, at which point it becomes a divided highway, and enters Springettsbury Township, continuing past more homes in the community of East York as a four-lane undivided road. The road heads into business areas and widens to a divided highway as it reaches an intersection with Memory Lane/Haines Road. PA 462 passes more commercial development before it runs past homes and comes to a junction with PA 24 in the community of Yorkshire. The route continues northeast through commercial areas as a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane, narrowing to three lanes before crossing an East Penn Railroad line at-grade in the community of Stonybrook. The road runs past a mix of residential and commercial development and crosses into Hellam Township, where the name becomes Lincoln Highway. The route intersects Shoe House Road, which leads north to the Haines Shoe House. PA 462 continues past development and enters the borough of Hallam at the Kreutz Creek Road/Freysville Road intersection. The road narrows to two lanes and becomes lined with homes as it progresses east through the borough. The route leaves Hallam for Hellam Township again and gains a center left-turn lane, passing east-northeast through farmland with some trees and development. The road heads into the borough of Wrightsville at the Cool Creek Road intersection and becomes two-lane undivided Hellam Street, passing through residential areas with a few businesses. PA 462 intersects the northern terminus of PA 624 at a Y intersection and heads east onto the  long Columbia\u2013Wrightsville Bridge, passing over PA 624 before heading across the Susquehanna River."

Upon reaching the eastern bank of the Susquehanna River, PA 462 heads into the borough of Columbia and passes over Norfolk Southern's Port Road Branch and PA 441 before descending off the Columbia\u2013Wrightsville Bridge and heading northeast into industrial areas on Chestnut Street. The route crosses North 3rd Street, which provides access to US 30 and PA 441, and heads into residential areas, turning southeast onto North 5th Street. PA 462 continues southeast onto Lancaster Avenue and passes more homes. The road gains a center left-turn lane and runs through more residential areas with a few businesses, crossing the Columbia and Reading Railway at-grade. The route heads past more businesses and some industry to the north of the road before it leaves Columbia for West Hempfield Township, where the name becomes Columbia Avenue. PA 462 continues through a mix of farmland and residential subdivisions, curving northeast. The road intersects Prospect Road south of an interchange with the US 30 freeway and passes near residential and commercial development and some fields before it enters the borough of Mountville. The route narrows to two lanes and is lined with homes as it heads east through the borough along Main Street. PA 462 comes to a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Columbia Secondary and continues through residential areas before it leaves Mountville and becomes the border between West Hempfield Township to the north and Manor Township to the south, with the name changing back to Columbia Avenue and the center left-turn lane returning. The road passes through a mix of homes and businesses, becoming the border between East Hempfield Township to the north and Manor Township to the south. The route continues east through residential and commercial development with nearby rural land. Farther east, PA 462 passes homes before it reaches an intersection with PA 741, where it is briefly a divided highway. The road heads into business areas and regains the center left-turn lane, passing a mix of homes and businesses in the communities of Wheatland and West Lancaster. The route crosses Little Conestoga Creek into Lancaster Township and runs through wooded suburban residential neighborhoods, passing north of the WGAL television studios. PA 462 enters the city of Lancaster and splits into a one-way pair at Race Avenue, with the eastbound direction continuing along two-way, two-lane Columbia Avenue and the westbound direction following West Walnut Street, which carries two lanes of one-way westbound traffic concurrent with westbound PA 23. PA 23 splits from westbound PA 462 by heading west along Marietta Avenue. A few blocks later, eastbound PA 462 heads from Columbia Avenue onto West King Street, which carries two lanes of one-way traffic eastbound. Eastbound PA 462 continues along West King Street and westbound PA 23/PA 462 continues along West Walnut Street, with eastbound PA 23 following West Chestnut Street one block south of westbound PA 23/PA 462. The one-way pair continues east through urban residential areas. Eastbound PA 462 intersects the eastern terminus of PA 999 at Manor Street. The route heads into the commercial downtown of Lancaster, where it intersects one-way southbound US 222/PA 272 at Prince Street.  A short distance later, PA 462 crosses one-way northbound PA 72 at Queen Street. The eastbound direction along King Street intersects Queen Street at Penn Square, where the Soldiers and Sailors Monument is located. The Central Market is located to the northwest of the square and the Lancaster County Convention Center is to the southeast of the square. Past this intersection, the route becomes East King Street eastbound and East Walnut Street westbound, with the eastbound direction passing south of the Lancaster County Courthouse west of the Duke Street intersection. The one-way pair intersects one-way northbound US 222/PA 272 at North Lime Street at the east end of downtown. Following this, PA 462 passes more homes and industrial establishments in the eastern part of the city. At North Broad Street, westbound PA 462 splits from westbound PA 23, and the two directions of PA 462 rejoin along East King Street. PA 462 follows East King Street, a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane, out of Lancaster and back into Lancaster Township, passing through residential areas. The road loses the center turn lane as it continues east past homes. The route crosses the Conestoga River into East Lampeter Township and becomes a four-lane divided highway, heading into commercial areas and intersecting the western terminus of PA 340 in the community of Bridgeport. PA 462 becomes Lincoln Highway and turns into a four-lane road with two eastbound lane, one westbound lane, and a center left-turn lane, passing businesses before continuing through suburban residential areas. The road runs east-southeast past more suburban development and widens into a four-lane divided highway as it comes to the Strasburg Pike intersection. PA 462 passes businesses before it comes to its eastern terminus at an interchange with the eastern end of the US 30 freeway. At this point, the Lincoln Highway continues east as part of US 30."

        "content": "The section of present-day PA 462 east of Lancaster was constructed as the westernmost part of the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, a turnpike connecting Lancaster to Philadelphia. The turnpike company was incorporated in 1792 and the road was completed in 1794. The Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike was built with a stone and gravel surface and was the first long-distance turnpike constructed in the United States, leading to a movement to improve roads across the country. The turnpike also opened up settlement to the Northwest Territory past the Ohio River and provided cheap transportation between the coastal areas and the \"bread basket\" region around Lancaster. By 1796, a road continued west from Lancaster to the Susquehanna River and to York. The Lancaster and Susquehanna Turnpike was chartered to run from Lancaster to Columbia in 1794 and was built in the 1810s. By 1843, the rise of the railroads and the canals reduced the use of the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, and the road fell into disrepair and saw decreased usage through the later part of the 19th century. The state acquired the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike in the beginning of the 20th century. Following the passage of the Sproul Road Bill in 1911, current PA 462 was designated as Legislative Route 126 west of York, Legislative Route 128 between York and Lancaster, and Legislative Route 215 east of Lancaster. In 1913, this portion of road became part of the Lincoln Highway, an auto trail that ran from San Francisco east to New York City. The Lincoln Highway within Pennsylvania was designated as PA 1 in 1924. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, US 30 was designated concurrent with PA 1 on the Lincoln Highway west of Philadelphia. The concurrent PA 1 designation was removed from US 30 in 1928. US 30 originally ran along King Street through the city of Lancaster. In York, the route followed Market Street through the city. The section of US 30 to the west of York, between York and Lancaster, and to the east of Lancaster was widened to a multilane highway in the 1930s. The route was shifted to use the one-way pair of King Street eastbound and Orange Street westbound through Lancaster in the 1930s. In the 1950s, US 30 was moved to the one-way pair of Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound through York. In 1967, US 30 was shifted to a freeway bypass between Prospect Road east of Columbia and east of Lancaster; PA 462 was designated onto the former alignment of US 30 between those two points. In 1972, PA 462 was extended west to its current terminus at US 30 west of York after US 30 was shifted to a bypass between west of York and Columbia. In the 1970s, the route was widened to a divided highway near the PA 24 intersection. The westbound direction of PA 462 in Lancaster was shifted from Orange Street to Walnut Street, running concurrent with PA 23, in the 1970s. In York, the eastbound direction of PA 462 was originally planned to be shifted to Princess Street as part of constructing Continental Square at the intersection of Market and George streets; however, it remained along Market Street."

The hall is an historic building that stands on land donated for the purpose, and as the land title deeds dated 1918 state: \"Upon trust for the use of the residents of Putty for Public, Religious and Social gatherings and for such other purposes as the said residents may from time to time determine...\".  The hall has undergone a continual restoration over the last 20 years, using volunteer labour and funds donated or raised during social events. The Hall is used as a Church on the second and fourth Sunday mornings of each week with Eucharists, Bible Study and Sunday School being provided by the local Anglican Priest from the Anglican Communities of Our Lady. The PCA hosts several annual events at the hall, including an Anzac day service, a Christmas gathering, a Christmas in July, and the \"Biggest Morning Tea\" to raise money for cancer research. The major social event is the Putty Spring Fair, held at the hall usually on a weekend-day in September. Various information and training sessions are also held at the Community Hall from time to time. The hall also serves as a place of refuge during times of local disaster. Bushfire and flood can quickly isolate the town making a return home impossible if caught on the wrong side. For such occasions, the PCA operates an emergency satellite phone in the event of a failure of the local telephone system. Putty's proximity to the Wollemi National Park means it is sometimes used as a starting or finishing point for treks. Hikers often utilise old logging trails that make it possible to walk through the national park on trips of eighty kilometres or more."

By 1872, shipping trade had increased so that more capacity was required and the Great Eastern Railway obtained permission to reclaim land at Ray Farm, a mile to the west of Harwich, and build a new quay. This new quay was opened in 1883 by Charles H. Parkes, the Chairman of the Great Eastern Railway company, the port being named after him as Parkeston Quay. The port had its own railway station, and a hotel was built between the northern platform and the quay; the hotel building is now used as offices. The railway station was originally called Parkeston Quay, but was renamed Harwich Parkeston Quay in 1934 when the new Parkeston Quay West station was opened to serve the west end of the quay. It was given its current name, Harwich International, in 1995. The port remained under the ownership of the Great Eastern Railway until 1923 when the company became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). In 1939 the Admiralty requisitioned Parkeston Quay for naval purposes, naming it HMS Badger. It was released back to the LNER in 1946. On 1 January 1948 the LNER was nationalised and the port came under the ownership of British Railways (BR). In 1984, as part of the privatisation of BR's Sealink ferry services, the port was sold to Sealink's new owners Sea Containers, which sold it on to Stena Line in 1989. In 1997 Parkeston Quay was acquired by Hutchison Port Holdings, which renamed the port Harwich International Port."

Previously, DFDS Seaways operated services to Esbjerg, Denmark (ceased 29 September 2014), Cuxhaven (and before that to Hamburg), Germany, and Gothenburg, Sweden; the latter two services were discontinued by 2005. Cruise ships once called regularly at the port during the summer months, although in recent times these calls have become more and more infrequent. The year 2016 saw 12 visits \u2013 the lowest since the service started. While the majority of opinion puts this down to the recent economic downturn, others feel the reason is due to the lack of facilities for visitors when compared to the likes of Southampton or Dover. Tankers call at the Carless refinery, and some general cargo and bulk cargos are worked at the port. As of May 2010, the port was the base for the installation of the offshore Greater Gabbard wind farm and Thanet Wind Farm in the southern North Sea, and has also been used for Gunfleet Sands Offshore Wind Farm.

The seaport will be linked to a port in Songkhla on the Gulf of Thailand. The port will be capable of accommodating 825,000 TEU of cargo per year as well as supertankers. It would mean that vessels would not have to sail through the Malacca Straits, notorious for pirate attacks, to reach deep seaports at Laem Chabang or Bangkok. Construction of the port would involve the creation of an artificial island 430 m wide and one kilometre long, an area of 292 rai about four kilometres offshore connected by a bridge. The project includes the construction of roads, port facilities and railway lines, all totalling about 4,734 rai (757 hectares). In his televised address of 17 April 2014, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, once again proposed that the project go ahead. The project has been vociferously opposed by environmental groups and many local residents. Prayut said the port would be Thailand's gateway to the Andaman Sea, linking the country with Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. He went on to say, \"I ask that conflicts in this area be halted. The government will help those affected by this project.\" Locals say marine traffic, pollution and contamination from logistic and petroleum activities will ruin the environment. The seaport and shipping lanes encroach on Mu Ko Phetra National Park, a source of local food and tourist revenue for locals. Construction of the seaport would mean that some of the national park would lose its protected status. A strategic environmental assessment (SEA) was initiated in 2003, to be submitted in April 2016 at a cost of 50 million baht. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was completed and approved in June 2009. At that time the project's owner, the Marine Department, was ordered to conduct an environmental and health impact assessment (EHIA), budgeted at 118 million baht. The EHIA was started in March 2015. In July 2018 the Ministry of Transport \"shelved\" the 9.7 billion baht project \"...to avoid fuelling conflicts between residents and state officials,...\" The port's construction would have required the expropriation of about 7,400 rai of land close to Ko Petra Marine National Park. A government source said, \"...it is about time to shelve the project because we cannot proceed with conducting an environmental impact assessment and public hearings as local villagers usually refuse to participate,...\" The suspension of the project immediately raised suspicions that the move was a ploy by the government to revive its popularity ahead of the 2019 elections after a series of public relations set-backs. A Bangkok Post editorial explained that, \"...in Thailand, 'being shelved' is a synonym for buying time\u2014most controversial projects re-emerge after public attention fades.\" As predicted by the Bangkok Post, in December 2019, the project was revived."

        "content": "The castle was built between 1123 and 1139 by Alexander de Blois, Bishop of Lincoln from 1123 to 1147. Alexander built a quadrilateral castle, akin to his construction at Newark Castle, with square towers and massive keep. He sited it on flat fen rather than on high ground, perhaps even replacing an earlier moated manor house on the site. This shows he intended it for a manor house (for storing the produce from episcopal land, administering episcopal estates and providing accommodation for the bishop and his entourage when he visited the area) rather than for defence, though the flatness of the fen site would make it very hard for an enemy to approach unseen. The building fulfilled its manor house function for most of its life, never withstanding an armed attack or siege but becoming one of the chief episcopal strongholds and an agricultural focus for the Bishop\u2019s estates in Sleaford and elsewhere. An outline of a 40 by 15 metre tithe barn (said to be the largest in Lincolnshire, and with a cattle shed and hay loft attached) can still be seen in the southern half of the castle - local inhabitants would pay their tithe (or rent for farming the land) to the bishop, either by time working for the bishop (either on his land or serving in his army or castle  garrison), a share of their crop, or a cash sum. A dam was placed across the river Slea at the end of Westgate, with a two-wheeled watermill behind it, producing a large pond to provide fresh fish for episcopal celebrations (an orchard just outside the castle provided fruit, and a dovecote to the east of the barn meat) along with rushes and thatch for roofing. The nearest the castle came to a siege were on two occasions when the bishop was forced to hand over his keys to King Stephen during the Anarchy (by Alexander himself, to buy his release after Stephen's successful siege of Newark Castle) and to Edward II in the 1320s when his loyalties were doubted. King John spent a night in the castle in October 1216 just after his disastrous crossing of the Wash and just before his death, and in 1430 Bishop Richard Fleming died in the castle."

The castle passed into the hands of the Duke of Somerset in 1544, from whom it was confiscated by the crown in 1546.  On both occasions, and in 1555, it was still said to be defensible and habitable.  John Leland described it at this time as well maintained with a gatehouse, which housed two portcullises, and a high central tower, 'but not sette upon a hille of raised yerth'. The castle began to fall into disrepair during the second half of the 16th century with the timber and lead roof being removed to be reused in buildings in the town, some of which survives to the present day.  The process of decline continued under the ownership of the Carre family. In 1604 it was described as \u2018the late fair castle\u2019, suggesting it had been largely or even fully dismantled before 1600. An early 18th-century engraving of the castle shows a ruin with a considerable amount of stonework still visible."

An engraving of the town in 1818 is described as showing a place which was \"distinctly Arcadian, reminiscent of a landscape by Claude sprinkled with civilised Georgian architecture\". However, the growth of the metallurgical industry was to transform the town. The Lower Swansea valley was a favourable area for industrial development because of the proximity of Swansea's port, easy access to coal deposits, and a supply of cheap labour. While lead and zinc were also smelted in west Glamorgan, Swansea's signature industry was copper. The first copper works was built at Landore in 1717. Initially copper ore was imported from Cornwall, Cardiganshire and Ireland, but by the 1820s Swansea was receiving shipments from as far afield as South America, Africa and Australia. The copper industry reached a zenith in the 1880s, when the majority of copper ores imported to Britain were shipped to Swansea and local works employed around 3000 men at any given time. From the 1870s, tinplate also became a major local industry, pioneered by the Siemens works at Landore. Tinplate production stimulated the further expansion of Swansea port with the opening of the Prince of Wales dock, to be used mainly for tinplate export, in 1882. The location of new tinplate works confirmed the steel industry's increasing preference for coastal sites near ports. However, the Welsh tinplate industry was dependent on exporting to the American market, and suffered serious implications from the imposition of the McKinley tariff in 1890."

A peculiarity of Swansea is the lack of employment in the city centre, relative to other towns and cities of similar size. Many major employers have moved to the Enterprise Park or other fringe locations. Only 4,510 office jobs are now located in the city centre, compared to 13,910 in Cardiff. This reduces spend in the city centre economy and underpins the weakness of the local retail sector. Low demand prevents speculative development of new commercial premises, which has created a vicious circle of city centre decline. In January 2008, developers were appointed to lead the regeneration of several major sites in the city centre and the waterfront. Proposals include  of additional retail space, 1,000 residential units and new leisure, office, hotel and conference facilities. The regeneration programme will take an estimated 15\u00a0years. The Welsh Development Agency (and now the Welsh Government) have been promoting the SA1 Swansea Waterfront development on the edge of the city centre, intended to become a \"lively, attractive waterfront destination... using an imaginative mix of land uses\". The WDA's Technium concept of incubator space for high technology firms (often spin outs from the local university) was launched at SA1, and additional facilities have now been constructed there and on the university campus. The Assembly and IBM are supporting a new Institute of Life Sciences at the university, which it is hoped will generate more highly skilled, high value-added jobs."

Records indicate that it was bounded to the north by Beira Lake, the ramparts of Colombo Fort and the city's cemetery (established in 1803), to the west by the Indian Ocean, whilst to the south by the Galle Face Hotel (established in 1864, although the original building on the site was a Dutch villa) and to the east by St Peter's Church (consecrated in 1821). The Galle Face Green was initially laid out by the Dutch as a means to enable their cannons a strategic line of fire against the Portuguese. One version of how the name Galle Face is derived, is that it is from the original Dutch name for the fortifications, in that the gateway which gave access to the Colombo Fort was called the Gal Gate, as it faced southwards to Galle and faas means front, so it literally means in front of the fortification that faced toward Galle. Another version is it is a corruption of the original name for the area's rocky shoreline, Gal Bokka, Gal being the Sinhalese for rock and that Gal Gate actually meant rock gate. In 1856 the then Governor of British Ceylon, Sir Henry George Ward (1797\u20131860) authorised the construction of a  promenade along the oceanside of the Galle Face Green, for ladies and children to saunter and \u2018take in the air\u2019.

The esplanade in front of the fort, previously a marshy area, was filled with earth and levelled for the purpose. The race course was approximately one and a half miles long. The area became known as the Colpetty Race Course, and was used for horse races until 1893 when horse racing moved to the Colombo Racecourse. The Turf and Sporting Club was also founded in the early 1820s, with the first officially recorded horse racing meet held on the Green in the 1821. In order to view the races a pavilion was erected at the highest point of the green, it was circular in shape, with wooden framework and a thatched cadjan roof. As the years went by, the pavilion building was improved, with wooden walls replaced by bricks and made larger. A more spacious building, known as the \u2018Race Bungalow\u2019, was subsequently built on the same spot. In September 1870 a viewing gallery was added, which came to be called the \u2018Grand Stand\u2019. Later a two-storey grandstand was built for members. In 1871 the Race Bungalow became the venue for the Colombo Club and since then it was referred to as the Colombo Club building. This building still stands today, with all its colonial grandeur, and is now the Crystal Ballroom of Taj Samudra Hotel."

Estate of Baniachong was so vast it crisscrossed all districts of Sylhet region as well as the greater Mymensingh, Dhaka and Comilla. In accordance with the Pargana system introduced by Murshid Quli Khan in 1722, Anwar Khan claimed tenure of 28 Parganas of Muazzamabad, but his claim was rejected after an investigation by the revenue office, as these Parganas belong to the posterity of Shah Muazzam Uddin Qureshi, who assumed the name of Muazzam Khan when he ascended the throne of Muazzamabad. Hence, these 28 Parganas: Banshikunda (Vamshikunda), Ranadigha, Shelvarsh, Sukhaid, B\u00e9taal, Palash, Laxmanshree, Chamtala, Pagla (Paragala), Dohaliya, Bazu Jatua, Sinchapaid, Shafahar (Shaharpara), Sik Sonaita (Sonauta), Atuajan (Atuajahan), Aatgaon, Kuwazpur, Joar Baniyachung,  Kasba Baniyachung, Jalsuka, Bithangal, Joanshahi, Mudaikaid (Mudakadi), Kuresha, Jantari (Yantri), Haveli Sonaita, Satar Sati and Paikuda, were allotted to new landholders that created numerous zamindars and taluquedars in former Muazzamabad (districts of Sunamganj and Habiganj). The history of the battle between Anwar Khan and his brother Hussain Khan (Bara Bhuiyans of Baniachang) with the Mughal army in the first decade of the seventeenth century is found in the Baharistan-i-Gayebi. Zamindars of Banyachung was renowned for their generosity, but the last zamindar was more than generous; he was well known for his  gullibility and his aged but adept and calculating servants such as dewans and chaudharies swindled him left, right and centre.  By the time of the retirement, dewans and chauddharies working for Banyachung zamindar ended up holding more lands than the zamindar himself. This was achieved through a severance scheme conjured up by a shrewd dewan; this scheme made the zamindar honour-bound to grant land (taluque) to his servants on retirement and there were two categories of taluque: (i) Khalisa and (ii) Mujrahi, aka Mujrai. The first category of taluque, i.e. Khalisa, was reserved for the male servants and the second category of taluque, i.e. Mujrai, was reserved for zamindar's courtesans.  This scheme ruined the zamindary of Baniyachung within a very short span of time and created numerous Khalisadar and Mujraidar in the region, who nowadays style themselves as chowdhury in Sylhet region."

There are three main theories behind its etymology: When British rule was firmly established, the indigo planters set up indigo factories in different places to satisfy their own interests. After setting up an indigo factory in the area (known as Neelkuthi), the indigo planters used to go out hunting from time to time. In the forest they faced tigers and bears. The word for bear in the Bengali language is \u09ad\u09be\u09b2\u09c1\u0995 (Bhaluk) and so Bhaluka is considered a corruption of Bhaluk. As the revenue office (kachari bari) of the eastern bazaar was under the name of Bhawal's zamindar, it was known as Bhawal-er Kachari. Some have theorised that this was shortened to Bhaluka. As the area is home to the Koch, another theory is that Bhaluka was named after the tribal Koch chief Bhaluk Chand Mandal."

It came under Muslim rule during the reign of Sultan Alauddin Husain Shah in the early fourteenth century. Khan Saheb Abedullah Chowdhury was a notable zamindar of Bhaluka. He and his wife, Halimunnesa Chowdhurani, made notable contributions to the development of Bhaluka. Under the orders of Abedullah Chowdhury and the help of Mansur Ali Khan, Zayed Ali and Zayed Khan, the Bhaluka Bazar (marketplace) was established. The Bhaluka Bazar area however was divided into two parts as two different zamindars (landowners) were in control. The western bazaar was under Maharaja Shashikanta of the Muktagacha Zamindari. The entirety of Bhaluka along with the eastern bazaar was under the Bhawal Zamindari. In the forests of the former part, there was a mazar whose custodian was Innat Faqir, the father of Wahid Ali Faqir. There was a courthouse in the eastern bazaar, and so rent was collected for the Zamindar of Bhawal. The village next to the marketplace also came to be known as Bhaluka. Separating from the Gafargaon Thana, Bhaluka was made its own administrative thana of Mymensingh Subdivision in 1917. Maulvi AKM Nazir Hosain was made the Sub-Registrar of Bhaluka. Their son Aftabuddin Chowdhury was a member of the National Assembly for the term 1965-1969 from the Pakistan Muslim League, and later an MP in Bangladesh from the same party. The Dhaka-Mymensingh highway was built in the regime of Ayub Khan because of the proposal given by Chowdhury. During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, Afsar Uddin Ahmed (Sub-sector Commander of Sector 11) collected arms and ammunition, and founded the Afsar Bahini - challenging the Pakistan Army. Mohammad Abdul Mannan, studying Civil Engineering and also the vice president of Rajshahi Engineering College student wing then, was the first to collect three units of 303 rifles from nearest thana and request Afsar Uddin to train all.Late Shah Ali Akbar was also a valiant freedom fighter of Bhaluka.He, along with Mohammad Abdul Mannan and Afsar Uddin Ahmed organized mukti bahini(freedom fighter) at Bhaluka. The Pakistan Army established military camps at Mallikbari, Ashka, Tamat, and Bhaluka Bazar. A memorial monument was established in Bhaluka Bus Stand. Bhaluka Thana was upgraded to an upazila in August 1983. In 2010, work started for the Kadigarh National Park located in Palgaon, Kachina Union."

It was founded as a medical facility in 1849 and named for St. Vincent de Paul, a seventeenth-century French priest, whose religious congregation of the Daughters of Charity inspired the founding in Maryland in 1809 of the Sisters of Charity by St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, a native New Yorker and Roman Catholic convert. St. Vincent de Paul is the patron saint of all charitable societies. Drawing on its Catholic heritage, SVCMC's emphasis was on patient-focused healthcare, with a special mission to provide care for the poor and disenfranchised. \"Respect: The basic dignity of the human person is the guiding principal in all our interactions, policies and procedures. Integrity: Integrity is the consistency between the Catholic identity we profess and the ways in which we act it is that quality of truthfulness, which fosters trust. Compassion: Compassion is the way we share deep concern, love and care toward each person. Excellence: Excellence is our way of demonstrating that we can always be more, always be better.\" In 1817, four Sisters of Charity from Emmitsburg, Maryland arrived at the request of Bishop John Connolly to establish an orphanage. As the congregation grew, the sisters opened more orphanages and began to staff parochial schools. In 1846, the Sisters in New York incorporated as a separate entity from the Sisters of Charity based in Maryland. They then set up a charity hospital to meet the demands of the poor and disadvantaged. It began as a thirty-bed hospital in a small brick house on East 13th Street. St. Vincent's served the poor as one of the few charity hospitals in New York City. The hospital opened on November 1, 1849, during a cholera epidemic, under the direction of Sister M. Angela Hughes, sister of Bishop John Hughes. With almost every room occupied by patients, the sisters ate, slept, and rested in a single room, or had their beds at the ends of the halls. A typhoid epidemic in 1852, filled the hospital to capacity. After outgrowing those quarters in 1856, the sisters moved to a former orphanage at the then undeveloped corner of West 11th Street and Seventh Avenue. In 1859, a fair was held at the New York Crystal Palace to raise funds to renovate the former orphanage and erect two additional wings. In 1870, the hospital introduced its first horse-drawn ambulance. In October 1892, it launched its School of Nursing. The Sisters admitted patients regardless of religion or ability to pay. The doctors from Bellevue also worked there. St. Vincent's also operated a soup kitchen. According to an 1892 New York Times article, St. Vincent's was distinguished from other hospitals in the city by its feeding of \"a large number of tramps and other destitute persons\". The poet Edna St. Vincent Millay got her middle name from the hospital, where her uncle's life was saved in 1892 after he was accidentally locked in the hold of a ship for several days without food or water."

        "content": "The school received its certification from the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York in 1905, one of the first such schools to be so recognized. In 1911, St. Vincent's Ambulance, manned by hospital interns, responded to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Manhattan, where the attendants watched helplessly as those trapped in the fire jumped to their deaths onto the street below. In 1912, St. Vincent's received and treated victims after the sinking of the , while mourning the loss of attending physician Francis Norman O'Loughlin, who died in the disaster. A plaque honoring his memory stood in the hospital's main entrance as a reminder of his dedication and sacrifice. In 1968, under William Grace, Director of Medicine at St. Vincent's, and his associate John A. Chadbourn, the hospital established the nation's first Mobile Coronary Care Unit (MCCU) following an example in Ireland. It was configured on a white over red 1968 Chevrolet Step-Van and utilized a portable battery-powered defibrillator/monitor; a battery-powered electrocardiograph, I.V. kit, resuscitation/oxygen kit, and a drug kit. The success of the St. Vincent's MCCU project inspired the development of the \"HeartMobile\" in Columbus, Ohio, and similar programs in Marietta, Georgia, Montgomery County, Maryland, and Los Angeles in 1970. In 1975, when the Puerto Rican extremist nationalist group FALN bombed Fraunces Tavern in the Wall Street area, St. Vincent's paramedics and responders from multiple other EMS agencies transported patients to St. Vincent's Hospital for trauma care. In the 1980s, as the gay population of Greenwich Village and New York began succumbing to the AIDS virus, St. Vincent's established the first AIDS ward on the East Coast and second only to one in San Francisco, and soon became \"Ground Zero\" for the AIDS-afflicted in NYC. The hospital \"became synonymous\" with care for AIDS patients in the 1980s, particularly poor gay men and drug users. It became one of the best hospitals in the state for AIDS care with a large research facility and dozens of doctors and nurses working on it. ACT UP protested the hospital one night in the 1980s due to its Catholic nature. They took over the emergency room and covered crucifixes with condoms in an effort to both raise awareness and to offend Catholics. Instead of pressing charges, the sisters who ran the hospital decided to meet with the protesters to better understand their concerns."

        "content": "The SVCMC network was formed in 2000, when St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, formerly the St. Vincent Hospital and Medical Center of New York, merged with the Catholic Medical Centers of Brooklyn and Queens and Sisters of Charity Healthcare on Staten Island, which included St. Vincent's Hospital (Staten Island), Mary Immaculate Hospital in Queens, St. John's Queens Hospital, Saint Joseph's Hospital in Queens, St. Mary's Hospital of Brooklyn, and Bayley Seton Hospital in Staten Island. The mergers were intended to reduce costs by improved efficiency and elimination reductant administration, however, it also brought increased debt with the member hospitals. St. Vincent's was the primary admitting hospital for those injured in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. A physician who worked at St. Vincent's, Sneha Ann Philip, was declared missing on September 10, and later declared as the 2,751st victim of the collapse of the towers. Pictures of the missing collected in such large numbers that the hospital dedicated an entire outside wall to protect them. The Wall of Hope and Remembrance was maintained for years. Many hospitals closed soon afterward. In 2003 St. Clare's Hospital was affiliated, and renamed St. Vincent's Hospital (Midtown), but it closed on August 1, 2007. St. Mary's Hospital of Brooklyn closed on September 23, 2005; Mary Immaculate and St. John's closed on March 1, 2009, after being sold to Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in 2006."

        "content": "In 2005, under financial pressure from its charity involvements and rising costs, the SVCMC system filed for bankruptcy.  The system launched an aggressive reorganization effort, selling or transferring its money-losing facilities and focusing development on its main hospital, which allowed it to emerge from bankruptcy in the summer of 2007.  In the name of modernizing and restructuring, it also announced plans to build a new Manhattan hospital across the street, with a planned opening set for 2011. Part of this redevelopment was to include construction of a billion-dollar residential condominium by the Rudin real estate family. The plan was a source of contention with several neighborhood groups, such as the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation and the Municipal Art Society. The Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the residential components of the plan in July 2009, but by then residential development financing was no longer available because of the global financial crisis. The New York State Department of Health said there is no need for an acute care hospital in Greenwich Village. St. Vincent's announced on January 27, 2010, that its financial situation had soured further and desperate measures would be required to keep the hospital open.  Senators, city council members and congressional representatives all became involved in attempting to save the hospital. A Greater New York Hospital Association spokesman pointed to health budget cuts in Albany.  The hospital entered discussions with Continuum Health Partners (the parent corporation of Beth Israel Medical Center, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, and New York Eye and Ear Infirmary) and with Mount Sinai Hospital to consider taking ownership of the hospital, but both ultimately declined. On April 6, 2010, the board of directors voted to close inpatient care services at St. Vincent's Catholic Medical Center, and to sell its outpatient services to other systems.  The emergency room stopped accepting ambulances on April 9, 2010, and delivered its last baby on April 15, 2010.  On April 19, 2010, more than 1,000 staff, representing approximately one-third of the hospital workforce, received notice of lay-off. On April 14, 2010, St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The petition, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, showed liabilities of more than $1 billion. On April 30, 2010, the emergency room at St. Vincent's closed, officially shuttering the hospital after 161 years. Hospital administrators said that the vote to close came after a six-month-long effort to save the financially troubled institution, but August 21, 2011, prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office were reported to have launched an investigation to determine whether administrators intentionally ran St. Vincent's into the ground. The remaining parts of Saint Vincent Catholic Medical Centers, including its nursing homes, home health agency, St. Vincent's Hospital Westchester, and US Family Health Plan, were to continue to operate without interruption, but these entities were sold to other providers' systems."

CBRE Group represented the seller, Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Centers. Eyal Ofer's Global Holdings assisted the buyer in the sale. At the time of its closure, St. Vincent's occupied a large real-estate footprint in Greenwich Village; it consisted of several hospital buildings and a number of outpatient facilities, had more than 1,000 affiliated physicians, including 70 full-time and 300 voluntary attending physicians, and trained more than 300 residents and fellows annually. As a Catholic hospital, St. Vincent's was officially sponsored by the Sisters of Charity and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn. St. Vincent's was the last Catholic general hospital in New York City. The St. Vincent de Paul stained glass window from the hospital was donated to St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center in Paterson, New Jersey, in honor of its legacy of charity. It is on display in the main lobby of the medical center. The building was completely demolished by early 2013. New York City has announced a deal that preserves a historic building and creates a new school on the site. Former City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said that the plan also calls for a reduction in the number of new apartments, funds for affordable housing and arts education in local schools."

During World War II, the Higgins plant occupied most of the land. At the factory there were homes constructed of plywood that employees were reported to have occupied during the war effort, they were aptly named Higgins Huts. With the growth of the city after the war and the need for new housing, Gentilly Woods was developed. A corporation founded by W.H. Crawford and Associates began work, in early 1951, with a plan to construct more than 1400 homes designed to meet the booming post-war housing market. The City of New Orleans made arrangements for public transportation and the developers signed contracts for city sewerage, drainage, water mains, and other site improvements before a single house was begun. Land was secured along Gentilly Boulevard for a shopping center, to serve the new community, and approximately  were reserved for school (Saint Gabriel the Archangel and W.C.C. Claiborne grammar schools) and playground use."

In 2005, MOCCA relocated to a repurposed textile factory in the West Queen West Art + Design District in downtown Toronto. The City of Toronto government funded the half-million-dollar renovation of the building. In 2015, with its building about to be demolished and replaced by condominiums, MOCCA hosted an interactive exhibit by Dean Baldwin entitled Queen West Yacht Club. At its former location on Queen West, the museum functioned as a hub for creative exchange and played a critical role in shaping the city's contemporary art scene. Through a commitment to collaborative partnerships with leading like-minded artists, organizations, institutions, and festivals from Toronto and further afield, MOCCA connected the city to a national and global network of peers. MOCCA featured the work of over 1,100 Canadian and other international artists, hosted 200+ exhibitions, and welcomed 40,000 annual visitors. As the lease on Queen West wound down, the need to move provided an opportunity to seek a larger space that could accommodate the museum's ever-growing aspirations and significance. In 2016, the museum changed its name to the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto Canada (MOCA). In September 2018, MOCA moved into a 55,000 square foot facility in a renovated former factory in the Lower Junction district. The museum received funding from the Canada Cultural Spaces Fund. The museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association, the Ontario Museum Association, and the Ontario Association of Art Galleries."

However, successive excavations on the Acropolis uncovered many new artifacts which significantly exceeded its original capacity. An additional motivation for the construction of a new museum was that in the past, when Greece made requests for the return of the Parthenon Marbles from the United Kingdom, which acquired the items in a controversial manner, it was suggested by some British officials that Greece had no suitable location where they could be displayed. Creation of a gallery for the display of the Parthenon Marbles has been key to all recent proposals for the design of a new museum."

        "content": "The first architectural competition to design a new museum was held in 1976 and was limited to participants from Greece. Both the 1976 competition and one that followed it in 1979 failed to produce any results mainly because the plots of land selected for the proposed constructions were deemed unsuitable. In 1989, a third competition for the design of the new Acropolis Museum was announced that would be international. A choice of three possible sites was provided. This competition was won by the Italian architects, Manfredi Nicoletti and Lucio Passarelli. After delays throughout the 1990s, work on the construction of the museum based on this third design progressed to the stage of excavations for the foundations, but these were stopped due to apparently sensitive archaeological remains on the site, leading to annulment of the competition in 1999.  In retrospect, the location of the new museum was rather straightforward: the large lot of the unused \"Camp Makrygianni\" gendarmerie barracks, opposite the Theater of Dionysus.  The barracks were built on public land and a limited number of expropriations of surrounding private houses were needed to free up the necessary space.  The main building of the old barracks, the neoclassical \"Weiler Building\", has been renovated and houses the Museum of the Center for the Acropolis Studies. The fourth competition had made no provision for the preservation of the ancient site. These were met to a degree only after local and international (ICOMOS) campaigners exposed this oversight and it became the final competition. The new plans were adjusted so that the building was elevated above ground, on pillars. Competition was open only to architectural practices by invitation and it was won by New York\u2013based architect, Bernard Tschumi, in collaboration with the Greek architect Michael Photiadis.  Excavation has revealed two layers of modest, private roadside houses and workshops, one from the early Byzantine era and another from the classical era.  Once the layout and stratigraphy of the findings were established, suitable locations for the foundation pillars were identified.  These traverse the soil to the underlying bedrock and float on roller bearings able to withstand a Richter scale magnitude 10 earthquake. As construction work neared completion, the operation to move the historic artifacts the  distance from the Acropolis rock to the new museum started in October 2007, took four months, and required the use of three tower cranes to move the sculptures across the distance without mishap. Greek officials expressed their hope that the new museum will help in the campaign for the return of the Parthenon Marbles."

        "content": "The design by Bernard Tschumi was selected as the winning project in the fourth competition. Tschumi's design revolved around three concepts: light, movement, and a tectonic and programmatic element. The collections of the museum are exhibited on three levels while a fourth middle level houses the auxiliary spaces such as the museum shop, the caf\u00e9, and the offices. On the first level of the museum, there are the findings of the slopes of the Acropolis. The long and rectangular hall has a sloping floor, resembling the ascension to the rock. Following the hall is a large trapezoidal hall that contains the archaic findings. On the same floor, there are artifacts and sculptures from the other Acropolis buildings such as the Erechtheum, the Temple of Athena Nike, and the Propylaea and findings from Roman and early Christian Athens. Visitors are intended to see the latter during descent in order to keep the chronological order: they will first be directed to the top level, which displays the Parthenon marbles. The top level of the Museum sits askew on the lower levels to achieve the same cardinal orientation of the ancient temple on the Acropolis.  The spacing of the columns of the Parthenon hall is the same as that of the ancient temple and the use of glass walls on all four exterior walls allows the natural light to illumine the Parthenon marbles as they do on the ancient temple.  The 48 columns in the Parthenon hall mark the outline of the ancient temple and form a colonnade for the display of the Parthenon marbles. For ease of viewing, the pediment marbles are displayed at eye level in front of the end columns; the metopes are displayed on the columns, two per column, but not as high as in the ancient temple; and the frieze are displayed behind the metopes, forming a continuous band around the walls of a rectangular space set inside the columns, as in the ancient temple but not as high, again for ease of viewing.  From the north side of the Parthenon hall, one can see the ancient temple above on the Acropolis. As the museum is built over an extensive archaeological site, some parts of the floor uses glass to allow visitors to see the excavations below. The museum also has an amphitheatre, virtual theatre, and hall for temporary exhibitions."

Apart from Adalberto's residence, it included a convent with 12 Benedictine monks and the church of Sant'Apollonio. It was protected by a triple line of walls; between the two lower lines were the barracks and the residence of the servants. During the Middle Ages, it was one of the most impregnable castles in Italy. Here in 950 Adelaide of Italy, the widow of King Lothair II, took refuge; Berengar II of Ivrea besieged her for three years, but in vain. The next most relevant episode is the famous reconciliation between Henry IV and Gregory VII, who was a friend of Matilda of Tuscany, who had inherited the castle, the centre of an impressive chain of watch towers and castles. Matilda established that her lands would be assigned to the Church after her death (1115), but her heirs did not accept it. In 1255 the men of Reggio destroyed the castle and the church. Later it was returned to the Canossa family. After the death of Giberto da Correggio in 1321, it was again a possession of Reggio until 1402, when Simone, Guido and Alberto Canossa gained it back; in 1409, however, they ceded it to the House of Este, who (apart a short period under Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma in 1557) held it until 1796. In 1502 Ercole I d'Este named the poet Ludovico Ariosto castellan. He resided here for six months. In 1593 Canossa was assigned as fief to the Counts Rondinelli. In 1642 Duke Francesco I entrusted it to the Valentini. The latter were ousted in 1796 by the rebellious local population, who joined the Republic of Reggio. After being returned to the Valentini, in 1878 the Castle was acquired by the Italian State, and was declared a national monument."

In 1872, SFTS began with four professors and four students meeting for instruction at the Presbyterian City College and Calvary Presbyterian Church, located at what now is Union Square, and St. John's Presbyterian Church. Six years later, the seminary moved to its own building next to the City College building on Haight Street. The seminary moved in 1891 to a  hilltop site in Marin County about  north of the Golden Gate Bridge. A new charter issued in 1900 gave the seminary power to grant degrees, and jurisdiction over the seminary was transferred from the synod to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in 1913. In the post World War II era under its president, Jesse Hays Baird, SFTS enjoyed unprecedented expansion, with enrollment increasing to more than 300 and new buildings rising all over the San Anselmo campus. SFTS joined in 1962 with neighboring graduate schools and academic centers in founding the Graduate Theological Union in  Berkeley. The GTU developed joint M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in cooperation with the graduate school at the University of California Berkeley. In 1990, SFTS opened its second campus in Pasadena, which was housed in the Pasadena Presbyterian Church. Due to seminary budget cuts, the board of trustees voted to close the Pasadena campus in February 2011. However, despite the announced closure, the seminary continued to consider alternative opportunities to expand their programs in Southern California. In February 2019, SFTS announced its intention to become part of the University of Redlands, based in Southern California's Inland Empire region. The merger was complete on July 1, 2019, and SFTS was embedded within a new Graduate School of Theology that carried SFTS programs forward and expanded opportunities for its students. In consequence of the merger, the PCUSA General Assembly's Committee on Theological Education (COTE) removed SFTS from its roster of Presbyterian Seminaries, and the Presbyterian Foundation withheld payments from a portion of SFTS endowment that it held in trust, on the grounds that the seminary no longer exists as an incorporated entity. While SFTS maintained its commitment to  Presbyterian 'theological education', the PC(USA) was unconvinced. \u201cAfter six years, there is no requirement of any Presbyterians on the UR Board, and after five years the proceeds from any sale of former SFTS assets may be used as determined in the discretion of that board, who are fiduciaries for the University of Redlands and not for the former SFTS. In short, COTE is concerned that the distinguished legacy of the former SFTS could disappear after five years.\u201d.. The co-moderators of the 224th General Assembly appointed a mediator, and after a year of negotiation, COTE, SFTS representatives, and the University of Redlands concluded an agreement \"reaffirming SFTS as a Presbyterian theological seminary related to the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)\" . COTE will present the agreement to the 225th General Assembly of the PCUSA in July 2022, with a recommendation for the Assembly to approve."

Other works are displayed on long-term loan, many on the understanding that they will be donated to the gallery in due course. As well as modern British art, the Gallery had one of the world's outstanding collections of 18th-century Bow porcelain, donated by Geoffrey Freeman, but it has since been transferred to the Holburne Museum in Bath."

        "content": "Pallant House is a Grade I listed Queen Anne townhouse built in 1712 for wine merchant Henry \"Lisbon\" Peckham and his wife Elizabeth.  It is a fine, brick-built building with large windows, with stone ostriches from the Peckham family arms guarding the entrance gateway, and a fine oak staircase inside. Its urbane design from a London architect was the subject of a suit in Chancery, for William Smart, mason of Chichester, provided a design about 1711, but the Peckhams went to London and obtained another design, designated \"the London modell\" in court papers. The architect was not identified. The building had been used as council offices since 1919. The building was restored in 1979, and the gallery opened in 1982.  It has been managed by an independent trust since 1985. A new wing was opened in June 2006, designed by Sir Colin Wilson and Long & Kentish.  The \u00a38.6\u00a0million project was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Arts Council England, the local council, and other donors.  The unashamedly modern block, which stands next to and integrates with the original Queen Anne building, won the 2007 Gulbenkian Prize; in the words of the judges, the juxtaposition creates \"a vibrant relationship between old and new ... continued in a series of inspired contemporary installations\" which are housed within. The extension was also listed for a 2007 RIBA award. It is believed to be the first art gallery in the UK which is heated and cooled by a geothermal system, using water pumped through 69 pipes descending 35\u00a0metres under the building, connected to reversible heat pumps, which roughly halves its carbon emissions. To the rear is a new courtyard garden, designed by Christopher Bradley-Hole, a Chelsea Flower Show gold medallist."

        "content": "Founded in 1966 by Donald E. Benson's Mighty-Mac Broadcasting Company, WIDG was just the second radio station to launch in the Eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan (following WSOO in Sault Ste. Marie.) The station was known for many years as \"Widge by the Bridge\" and aired mainly middle of the road music, at times a blend of top 40. The nickname \"Widge by the Bridge\" was coined by a longtime friend of station founder Donald E. Benson, a Lansing-based dentist who thought WITL-Lansing's slogan \"Whittle while you work\" was something that WIDG needed.  The original CP for the station had the call letters WSTI, \"St. Ignace\" but Benson felt the call letters looked like \"Stye\". In the late 1970s, Benson obtained a construction permit for an FM station that would become WMKC. Construction on the new FM station began shortly after the license was granted on July 30, 1979; and in December of that same year, Benson also obtained a dark license for WIDG and kept the station dark until April 1981, when he was required to return WIDG to the air in order for WMKC to come on the air.  WIDG returned with an MOR format until a format change to Big Band and standards and the call letters WLVM (\"We Love Michigan\", with the station's music format provided by TM's \"TMOR\" package). In 1985, the station returned to the WIDG calls with a top 40 oldies format until 1988, when WIDG simulcast sister FM's WMKC St. Ignace and WCKC-Cadillac's country music format. Eventually, in the early 1990s, WIDG once again adopted separate programming from WMKC, airing first oldies (as \"Cool 940\") and then classic country (as \"Classic KC Country\") before the sports-talk format was introduced. WIDG was initially an affiliate of One-on-One Sports (which later became Sporting News Radio) before switching to the ESPN Radio feed. WIDG operates with an omnidirectional antenna and with very low power after local sunset to avoid interference with the now-defunct CINW (formerly CBC Radio-owned CBM-AM) in Montreal. In WIDG's heyday, it constantly fought for a good signal into the north and was stymied by 10\u00a0kW CKCY-920 Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.  WIDG's signal was obliterated by CKCY north of Rudyard.  When CKCY went dark, WIDG finally got the full potential of its 5\u00a0kW signal and can be heard well into the province of Ontario. Though CINW (the former CBC Radio-owned CBM) has been silent since 2010, WIDG must still power down from 5,000\u00a0watts to 4\u00a0watts at sunset per FCC rules. On December 11, 2019, WIDG and its sister stations were acquired by Immaculate Heart Media, bringing Relevant Radio programming to Northern Michigan."

Since its inception, Le Rocheton has served a number of different purposes. Through the 19th century the estate belonged to the Rochefoucauld family until being purchased in 1816 by Saint-Joseph de Lyon nuns. Their prime mission was to offer education and health care to children. In 1946 the estate was acquired by the YMCA. Because of its close proximity to Paris, the American army and the YMCA had used Le Rocheton as a halfway house during World War II. American soldiers who had been taken captive by the German army would stay at Le Rocheton prior to returning home to America. In the 1950s, the centre began to accommodate asylum seekers from all over the world.  To this day it is still owned by the YMCA.  Its primary purpose is to serve as a hotel for tourists, families, and groups.   Educational and professional training programs are also offered."

The route runs  from PA\u00a0263 in Hatboro, Montgomery County east to PA\u00a032 in Yardley, Bucks County. PA\u00a0332 runs through suburban areas to the north of Philadelphia, serving Warminster, Ivyland, Richboro, and Newtown. The route is two lanes wide most of its length, with the bypass around Newtown a four-lane divided highway. PA\u00a0332 intersects PA\u00a0132 in Warminster, PA\u00a0232 in Richboro, PA\u00a0413 and PA\u00a0532 in Newtown (all three run concurrently on the Newtown Bypass), and Interstate\u00a0295 (I-295) in Lower Makefield Township. What would become PA\u00a0332 between Newtown and Yardley was designated part of Legislative Route\u00a0252 in 1911.

        "content": "PA\u00a0332 begins at an intersection with PA\u00a0263 (North York Road) in the borough of Hatboro in Montgomery County, heading east on East Montgomery Avenue, a two-lane undivided roadway. The road passes through residential areas, crossing SEPTA's Warminster Line at-grade. Immediately after crossing the railroad tracks, the route turns northeast onto Jacksonville Road and runs through industrial areas with some homes and businesses. PA\u00a0332 intersects East County Line Road and it enters Warminster Township in Bucks County, gaining a center left-turn lane. The road passes between the Warminster station that serves as the terminus of SEPTA's Warminster Line to the west and the neighborhood of Warminster Heights to the east. The route loses the center turn lane before it widens to four lanes and crosses PA\u00a0132 near businesses as it continues near industrial parks. The road narrows back to two lanes past the Johnsville Boulevard intersection and enters the borough of Ivyland, heading past homes. The route becomes the border between Ivyland to the northwest and Warminster Township to the southeast prior to crossing Bristol Road into Northampton Township. PA\u00a0332 continues between industrial areas to the northwest and residential areas to the southeast, reaching an intersection with Almshouse Road in the community of Jacksonville. PA\u00a0332 turns southeast onto Almshouse Road and runs through a mix of farm fields and residences. Past the Hatboro Road intersection, the road curves to the east and gains a center left-turn lane, heading into the community of Richboro. In Richboro, the route passes through business areas and intersects PA\u00a0232. Upon crossing PA\u00a0232, PA\u00a0332 changes its name to Newtown Richboro Road and continues past more homes as a two-lane road. The road forms the southern boundary of Tyler State Park, running between areas of fields and woods in the park to the north and residential subdivisions to the south and intersecting Holland Road. The route curves northeast and then east before crossing the Neshaminy Creek into Newtown Township, where the name changes to Richboro Road. In this area, the road briefly widens into a divided highway before it comes to an intersection with PA\u00a0413/PA\u00a0532 at the Newtown Bypass, a road that provides a bypass of the borough of Newtown. At this point, PA\u00a0332 turns south onto the four-lane divided Newtown Bypass, forming a concurrency with PA\u00a0413/PA\u00a0532. The road heads through wooded areas with nearby residential development, with PA\u00a0532 splitting southwest onto Buck Road toward Holland. PA\u00a0332/PA\u00a0413 curve east, passing over Newtown Creek and coming to a bridge over Freedom Drive and the abandoned Fox Chase/Newtown railroad line. The road enters Middletown Township before PA\u00a0413 splits from the bypass by turning south onto Newtown Langhorne Road toward the borough of Langhorne. PA\u00a0332 continues east near residential and commercial development as it crosses back into Newtown Township and runs a short distance to the north of the border between Newtown Township and Middletown Township, passing north of a shopping center that is served by an eastbound ramp. The road curves to the northeast at the Penns Trail/Woodbourne Road junction before turning east past the intersection with Newtown Yardley Road. Upon intersecting Lindenhurst Road/Campus Drive north of the Newtown Campus of Holy Family University, the route enters Lower Makefield Township and becomes Newtown Yardley Road. The road passes through farmland before heading north of an office park and reaching a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-295. Following this interchange, PA\u00a0332 becomes a two-lane undivided road and intersects Mirror Lake Road before it enters residential areas and crosses Buck Creek. The route reaches a junction with Yardley Langhorne Road and turns northeast onto Afton Avenue. PA\u00a0332 crosses into the borough of Yardley, where it is known as West Afton Avenue. The road heads into the downtown area and crosses Main Street, where the road name changes to East Afton Avenue, and the Delaware Canal. PA\u00a0332 comes to its eastern terminus at an intersection with PA\u00a032, which runs along the west bank of the Delaware River."

Between Ivyland and Newtown, the road remained an unnumbered road that was paved with the exception of a portion west of Newtown. PA\u00a0332 was extended from Ivyland east to end at PA\u00a0113 (State Street) in Newtown in 1937, with the entire route paved by 1940. PA\u00a0332 entered Newtown from the west on Richboro Road. In 1943, PA\u00a0332 within Warminster Township was widened as part of a military access road to Naval Air Development Center, Johnsville, costing $93,789. In 1946, PA\u00a0332 was extended east to Yardley, replacing that portion of PA\u00a0532. The route continued north from its previous eastern terminus on PA\u00a0413 (former PA\u00a0113, State Street) before turning east on Washington Street and leaving Newtown on Newtown Yardley Road. The portion of the Newtown Bypass carrying PA\u00a0332 west of PA\u00a0413 (Newtown Langhorne Road) was completed as part of a western bypass of Newtown for PA\u00a0413 in 1977. In September\u00a01989, construction began to extend the Newtown Bypass east to the interchange between PA\u00a0332 and I-95 (now I-295). Construction on this bypass was completed in November\u00a01991 at a cost of $16.6\u00a0million.  With the completion of this bypass, PA\u00a0332 was routed to bypass Newtown. On April\u00a022,\u00a02014, the portion of PA\u00a0332 along the Newtown Bypass west of the PA\u00a0413 split at Newtown Langhorne Road was renamed the Officer Gregg Memorial Bypass in honor of Brian S. Gregg, a borough of Newtown police officer who was killed in the line of duty on September\u00a029,\u00a02005."

There are hundreds here, built by the Treveri, a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived. Among the most important archaeological finds unearthed at one of the two barrows where digs have been undertaken is a beak-spouted clay ewer. Buried with Celtic princes in the time around 400 BC (La T\u00e8ne A) were Etruscan bronze beak-spouted ewers, a luxury that few could afford. These were for serving Celts as festive wine vessels, even in the afterlife. Grave goods from ordinary people's graves, however, were humbler things, mostly made of clay. Nowhere had a clay imitation of a bronze Etruscan ewer ever been unearthed, which was somewhat against expectations, until 1972. That year, in Sien, a Celtic warrior's grave yielded up such a vessel. The humble potter had not merely slavishly copied the Etruscan model, but had also thrown the 29\u00a0cm-tall piece on his wheel in such a way that he gave it a thoroughly unique artistic form. The original is to be found at the Trier State Museum, while a replicas are on display at the local history museum in Birkenfeld and in Sien."

The column, unearthed in 1973, was carved out of a single block of stone (a monolith). With the capital and the abacus, it measures some 2\u00a0m tall. It tapers slightly towards the top and has a diameter of roughly 36\u00a0cm. The column's surface is, given sandstone's characteristics, rough. In two places, just above the base and also just below the necking, is a fine groove turned on a lathe. On the whole, it could be an example of the Tuscan style. The column can nowadays be found being used as a support for the little porch at the entrance to the Evangelical church in Sien."

        "content": "Today's village of Sien was founded by Germanic, namely Frankish, settlers who made it their home after the Roman Empire had fallen. Bearing witness to this is the village's own name, Sien, which likely derives from the Old High German word sinithi (\u201cgrazing land\u201d). Since the parish of Sien is considered one of the oldest ones in the area, the village may well have been one of the earliest Frankish foundings in the time between the 6th and 10th centuries. Moreover, Sien was the hub of a high court district, witnessed as early as 970, and a fief granted by the Salian emperor to the Emichones, gau counts in the Nahegau, who later called themselves the Waldgraves and Raugraves. The Nahegau was divided into administrative zones called Hochgerichte (\u201chigh courts\u201d). The one whose seat was in Sien was called the Hochgericht auf der Heide (\u201cHigh Court on the Heath\u201d). The Hochgericht comprised a vast area (18\u00a0650\u00a0ha) between the Nahe and the Glan with all together 50 population centres, although some of these later vanished. Court was held at least once a year on the heath near Sien (hence its name). The count or the Schulthei\u00df, as the king's representative, administered justice along with 14 Heidesch\u00f6ffen (\u201cheath Sch\u00f6ffen\u201d, or, roughly \u201cheath lay jurists\u201d). Today the cadastral names K\u00f6nigsw\u00e4ldchen (\u201cKing\u2019s Little Wood\u201d) and Galgenberg (\u201cGallows Mountain\u201d) recall the former execution places."

        "content": "In 1128, Sien had its first documentary mention in the so-called Adalbert Document, in which it says that Archbishop of Mainz Ruthard had bestowed upon the Disibodenberg Monastery \u2013 quite possibly as an economic hedge \u2013 one Hufe of land (this was between 30 and 60 Morgen, and a Morgen itself could be between 0.2 and 1\u00a0ha) in Sien (\u201c\u2026et in Sinede hubam\u201d). In this same document, the namesake Archbishop of Mainz Adalbert (1109-1137) confirmed his predecessor's donations to Disibodenberg. The donation of the Hufe of land might have taken place about 1108, for it was then that building work on a new Benedictine monastery began at the forks of the Nahe and Glan, after the old one had been destroyed in the 10th century and forsaken by the monks. The Adalbert Document is reproduced in the Disibodenberg Monastery's cartulary, now kept at the state archive at Darmstadt. Over the course of history, the village has been known as Sinede, Synede, Synde, Syende, Siende and Syne, among other names, before settling on the currently customary form, Sien. Divisions of inheritance and feuds led to an ever-greater splintering of the gau counts\u2019 formerly unified holding. Thus, Sien passed by way of inheritance in 1112 to the Counts of Veldenz, the Emichones\u2019 successors. From the 13th century, Sien itself was even divided. One part belonged to the Waldgraves of Grumbach \u2013 and as of 1375 to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Kyrburg \u2013 while the other part was held by the Counts of Loon (a place nowadays in Belgium), who were offspring of the V\u00f6gte and prefects of the Foundation of Mainz, and thereby also possibly heirs to the Mainz church estate in Sien. In 1325, the Counts of Loon, who in the late 13th century built a moated castle on their part of Sien, enfeoffed the knight Kindel von Sien with the castle and half the village of Sien, as well as with further, considerable holdings. The small castle was known in documents as Festes hus (\u201csteadfast house\u201d), but for all its steadfastness, on 28 September 1504, it was destroyed in the Landshut War of Succession and was never restored. All that is left of it now is the former castle well. There is also a memorial plaque on Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe (\u201cCastle Street\u201d) in the village. Two local cadastral names also recall the old castle: \u201cSchlosswies\u201d (\u201cCastle Meadow\u201d) and \u201cAm Weiher\u201d (\u201cAt the Pond\u201d \u2013 meaning of course the former moat). The part of the municipal area where the castle once stood was officially known as Sienerh\u00f6fe (\u201cSien Estates\u201d), but it was never locally known as anything other than the Schloss (\u201cCastle\u201d), and accordingly, the inhabitants were called the Schl\u00f6sser. The Counts, though, ceded the feudal overlordship over their Sien holdings in 1334 to the Waldgraves of Dhaun. The then Count of Loon and Chiny, Ludwig, issued a writ releasing all his vassals and subjects who were part of the castle holding from any and all duty and loyalty to him, but in the same breath, Ludwig reminded them that they now owed their new overlord, the Waldgrave of Dhaun, Johannes, the same as they had owed their old overlord. The writ bore Ludwig's seal on the back. An enfeoffment document gives information about the fief. It apparently comprised the castle, half the village of Sien, half the village of Sienhoppst\u00e4dten, the lordly rights as they pertained to the church and the tithes from Sien, Sienhoppst\u00e4dten, Schweinschied, Selbach, Reidenbach, Oberhachenbach and Niederhachenbach. In 1431, the Knights of Sien died out in the male line. Schonetta von Siende, the last knightly feudal lord's niece, brought the Sien fief by marriage to Reinhard von Sickingen to the Lords of Sickingen, whose best known family member was her grandson, Franz von Sickingen. Schonetta von Siende was the last of the knightly house of Sien. Her first marriage was to the knight Hermann Boos von Waldeck, but he died young. A son that she bore in this union inherited parts of Dickesbach and Schmidthachenbach from the Sien fief. Schonetta married her second husband in 1449, and bore him a son, Schwicker von Sickingen, who later became Franz von Sickingen's father. Schonetta died on 1 January 1483 in Kreuznach. In the upheaval of the Reformation, her bones were transferred from Kreuznach to Ebernburg, where the family Sickingen kept its seat. Thereafter, however, the trail is lost, and the whereabouts of Schonetta's bones is now unknown. There is, however, still a stone to her memory at the parish church in Sien. It dates from roughly 1560."

        "content": "In 1765, the Sickingens sold off their holdings in Sien to Johann XI Dominik Albert, Prince at Salm-Kyrburg (known as Prince Dominik) and owner of the other half of Sien, thereby ending the age of two lords holding the village as a condominium. One thing left over from that age, though, was the denominational split between Catholics and Protestants that had arisen from the two lords\u2019 different policies. On the other hand, under Prince Dominik's enlightened rule, trade and crafts blossomed, which was something sorely needed. Hardly needed, though, were some of the subsequent events, such as the Plague, the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) and the Nine Years' War (1688-1697; known in Germany as the Pf\u00e4lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), which laid the land waste and sharply decimated the local population. According to one memorandum, in 1698, Sien comprised no more than 15 houses. Prince Dominik was one of the most important rulers among the Lords of Salm, to whom the Oberamt of Kirn passed after the Waldgravial-Rhinegravial line of Kyrburg died out. He was born in 1708 in Mechelen, nowadays in Belgium, and despite being orphaned at the age of eight, this Jesuit-educated boy lived what was at that time a relatively charmed life as an heir to the Salm estates. His father's death, of course, meant that he inherited his father's holdings, the lordship of Leuze in the County of Hainaut (nowadays mostly in the Belgian province of Hainaut, but with parts in the neighbouring French Department of Nord). Thus, even as a youngster, he could enjoy a carefree life of leisure in Vienna, the more so when he and his brother Philipp Joseph received the Oberamt of Kirn in 1743. This included the Schulthei\u00dferei of Sien, along with half the village of the same name. Two years later, both brothers were raised to princely status. Dominik now underwent a gradual shift in his ways of thinking and in his attitude towards life, which was helped along by various educational travels, whereafter he permanently moved house in 1763 to Kirn so that he could quite humbly live amongst his subjects. As an enlightened prince, he was very concerned about their welfare, and worried particularly about their education and religious upbringing. Prince Dominik built himself many lasting monuments, mostly ecclesiastical buildings. In Sien, he had the old church, which had fallen into disrepair, torn down in 1765, and on the same site, he had built a new church in plain, rustic Baroque style with a tower topped with an onion dome. Today, this is the Evangelical church. However, at the time it was built, Prince Dominik stipulated that it was to be open for use by both Catholics and Protestants, thus creating a simultaneum. The hunting lodge in Sien, now run as an inn, is also one of Prince Dominik's projects. In 1770 he had it built by his court master builder, Johann Thomas Petri. It features a triaxial middle risalto under a triangular spire light, a slated mansard roof and above the doorway a sandstone relief by Bernkastel sculptor Johann Philipp Maringer showing two wildmen bearing the princely coat of arms. When Johann XI Dominik Albert, Prince at Salm-Kyrburg, died on 2 June 1778, there was great and sincere mourning. His remains lie in the quire at the Evangelical Kirche am Hahnenbach (\u201cChurch on the Hahnenbach\u201d) in Kirn."

        "content": "The 1789 French Revolution marked the end of princely rule in the little Principality of Salm-Kyrburg, to which Sien belonged. The ideals of Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9 were brought into the territorially splintered land of Germany by French Revolutionary troops. Soon, la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise stretched all the way to the Rhine\u2019s left bank. On 10 March 1798 the liberty pole was put up in Sien. Sieners were no longer serfs, but rather free French citizens. The properties formerly held by the last Salm-Kyrburg Prince, Friedrich III, Prince Dominik\u2019s nephew, who had already been put to death by guillotine in Paris by 1794, were confiscated and auctioned off to the highest bidder. Even the Prince\u2019s hunting lodge got a new, untitled owner. Sixteen years French times lasted (1798-1814), during which Sien was raised to a mairie (\u201cmayoralty\u201d) for the surrounding villages of Sienhachenbach, Oberreidenbach, Dickesbach, Kefersheim, Illgesheim, Hoppst\u00e4dten, Oberjeckenbach and Unterjeckenbach. The lands acquired by France on the Rhine's left bank were subdivided on the French model into departments, arrondissements and cantons. The Mairie of Sien belonged to the Canton of Grumbach, the Arrondissement of Birkenfeld and the Department of Sarre, whose seat was at Trier. Even after the German campaign that put an end to the War of the Sixth Coalition in the Napoleonic Wars, Sien remained a mayoralty in the Saxe-Coburg-ruled Principality of Lichtenberg with its capital at Sankt Wendel. This territorial arrangement was set forth at the Congress of Vienna. It retained the status when the Prussians took over in 1834. In Saxe-Coburg times, and Prussian times, too, the B\u00fcrgermeisterei (\u201cMayoralty\u201d) of Sien comprised Sien and Sienerh\u00f6fe (where the castle had been), Sienhachenbach, Schmidthachenbach, Mittelreidenbach, Oberreidenbach, Weierbach, Dickesbach, Zaubach, Kefersheim, Wickenhof, Ehlenbach, Wieselbach, Kirchenbollenbach, Mittelbollenbach and Nahbollenbach. In Prussian times, the Amtshaus (administrative centre for the Amt) was built. With the new lords, a gradual economic upswing set in, reaching a peak in the latter half of the 19th century. Many urban-style houses and the Gothic Revival Catholic church, upon whose consecration in 1892 the simultaneum ended, still bear witness to the wealth at that time. Sien's small Jewish community enjoyed a heyday in the 19th century, too, which found architectural expression in the synagogue, built about 1845. Despite the favourable economic development, however, many Seiners chose to emigrate, with most going to the United States. The economic upswing brought along with it a building boom. As well as the houses and the Catholic church mentioned above, the Evangelical parish built a new schoolhouse in 1838 out of its own financial resources. A Catholic schoolhouse followed in 1868. In 1871, Sien had roughly 600 inhabitants, of whom some 70 were of Jewish background. There was a vast array of retail businesses, as well as four inns and a brewery. A major knitting mill, a brickyard and a construction company also set up shop in the village. A full range of craft businesses was also available then. The late 19th and early 20th centuries also saw improvements in infrastructure. Streets were cobbled, and lit by lanterns at night, modern (for that time) firefighting equipment was secured, as well as a steam-powered threshing machine, and a watermain was built. In the 20th century, though, Sien suffered several unfortunate blows. The railways through the Nahe and Glan valleys bypassed the village, stripping it of its hitherto enjoyed status as an economic centre of sorts. This led in turn to the loss of the mayoralty, which had to be yielded to Weierbach in 1909. The structural shift in agriculture and the expropriation of land by the Third Reich for the new Baumholder troop drilling ground in 1938, displacing roughly 4,000 people and stripping Sien of a great deal of its outlying municipal area, led to a further loss for the municipality's position as an economic and political force locally. The once well attended markets held in the village died out, and the population figure began to shrink. On 1 April 1939, Sienerh\u00f6fe, which until this time had been a self-administering municipality, was amalgamated with Sien. In the early 21st century, the economic downturn has been turned round somewhat with the location of modern industrial operations in the municipality."

Although the Jewish population had been rising in the earlier half of the 19th century, in the latter half, it shrank. This trend continued after the turn of the century. There were 36 in 1895, and only 10 by 1925. Sien's last six Jews were deported by the Nazis in 1942 and murdered in the Holocaust. Sien's Jews belonged mostly to two families, Rothschild and Schlachter. To be sure, there were other surnames, but these two predominated. Recalling the former Jewish community and its culture today are very few things. Among these are the graveyard, a mikveh and a Jewish livestock merchant's account book."

This drainage area contains a high diversity of plant and animal life. A variety of aquatic plants have been identified including sedges, bull rushes and bladderwort. Many species of trees and shrubs common to the boreal forests of eastern Newfoundland thrive on the shoreline and hillsides of the river valley. White birch, cherry, and larch provide spectacular fall colors while fir, black spruce and juniper support the blanket of winter snowfall. Over thirty different species of wild flowers grow along the edge of the river or under the forest canopy. These include yarrow, thistle, sheep laurel, wild mint, goldenrod and the showy blue flag iris. Small and large mammals call Manuels River their home. Moose, red fox, and barren ground caribou inhabit the upper reaches of the watershed while hare, squirrels, beaver and muskrat prefer the lower river channel or the mouth. The variety of bird life spotted along the river or at its mouth include sandpiper, crow, pigeons, juncos, gulls, and the belted kingfisher. The kingfisher enjoys the distinction of being the emblem for the Manuels River Natural Heritage Society."

        "content": "The \"maze\" consists of two rectangular boxes\u2014one large and containing the other; centered. If one traces the patterns with different colored markers, one would find that between the boxes are two contiguous geometric patterns that resemble a maze. One \"maze\" is contained by the other on the left hand side. The swastika that appears in the lower left hand corner is not part of the original work as evidenced by a 1930s era photo featured in the Hemet Centennial calendar (featured photo of July 2010; available from the Hemet Museum located at the old train depot on the northwest corner of State and Florida). The stone and its surrounding land became a California state landmark in 1956, and sometime thereafter a vandal added a counter-clockwise swastika to one corner of the carving. This is not the same swastika that the Nazis in Germany appropriated after WWI; the Nazis used the clockwise version of the swastika. Swastikas were used in Oriental and Native American art long before the symbol became associated with Adolf Hitler. The stone is now protected by a pair of chain-link fences. The maze petroglyph, depending upon interpretation, could show four walled structures or areas, consisting of two simple objects and two \u201cmaze-like\u201d complex objects. There is an inner and outer object for each type of simple or complex object. To reference the diagram called \u201cConceptual Approximation of the Maze Stone near Hemet, California,\u201d the \"simple\" objects are denoted by the square/rectangular black (outer) and gray/beige (inner) lines. The gray/beige area is filled in and appears as a rectangular object.  What the computer considers a gray color, other people say is the color beige. The \"complex\" objects are blue (outer) and purple (inner). Notice how the purplish complex object is completely surrounded by the blueish complex object. The inner objects are completely surrounded in the space created by the outer objects. The blueish object seems to surround the simple gray object in the center, but is unable to completely do so, and the gray/beige object is either directly attached and is completely surrounded by the space associated with the outer black boundary wall that surrounds the whole \u201cmaze.\u201d Taking away or adding the blue and purple areas makes no difference to the relationship between the inner gray/beige object and the outer black boundary line, as the space between them is still connected. The space inside the black line was left white/blank.  Be aware the diagram was created with visual guesswork from multiple pictures using a computer graphics program to draw straight, colorized lines without measurements. The petroglyph appears to be a square, although the attempt to redo the diagram by computer produced better results when slightly elongated into a rectangle. Also the original is on the slightly curved surface of a stone, although there were flatter stones that could have been chosen in the region. Whether the maze can be recreated in a square while attempting to keep all the lines uniformly separated on a flat surface is a question that arose while creating the conceptual approximation diagram. Since there are ten lines to be crossed on the top, bottom, left and right of the original petroglyph, it stands to reason the idealized version of the \u201cmaze\u201d could fit into a square. The original design constraints and reasoning behind the prehistoric design remain unclear even today, but show in the choices made while creating the \u201cmaze.\u201d To give a few examples, at any given spot in the blueish space, there are up to three possible directions to follow, not the four directions possible when 90 degree line segments join together. The outside edge of the outer complex object shows the outline of the inner complex object three times. There are three \u201cdead ends\u201d (in maze terminology) to the blueish-object\u2019s area. If one looks at the spot where two of the blueish ends meet before reaching the inner complex object on the left side, one would have to transverse six straight segments to reach that point \u2013 from either end point. The analysis discussion can also be changed by switching the walls to pathways and the pathways to be impassable areas, but the \u201cmaze\u201d has design features that have nothing to do with a conventional \u201cmaze\u201d where the objective is to go from a starting point to an ending point through a confusing set of passageways. The Maze Stone is certainly not what might be considered a regular maze, even though it may look like one. Without knowing the original intent of the creator, it is difficult to know if the maze represents an engineering drawing, a symbol, an artistic concept or something else. This petroglyph is classified as California Engraved, within the California Tradition of rock art."

A marina, hotel, restaurants, condominiums and townhouses have now been built on Nanny Cay. It also holds a minor footnote in legal history, having been the subject of a receivership for over 12 years during the 1980s and 1990s, and is the longest ever receivership in the history of Barclays Bank PLC.  The current owners, Cameron McColl and John McCoach and Graeme Scott purchased it from Barclays. Today, Nanny Cay has a marina and boatyard which has berths for 180 motor cruisers and yachts and two boat lifts of 50 and 70 tons capacity with storage for 200 boats.  It also includes a 40-room hotel and new waterfront townhouses for purchase and rental, two restaurants, a small supermarket, shops and boutiques, a dive shop, a water sports center, and a gym and spa.

Together with the Pulvermaar and the R\u00f6merberg, it forms a nature conservation area, which became protected in 1984. In the village itself sits a lava bomb, a basalt globe formed by volcanic activity. It has a diameter of some five metres and a weight of more than 120 metric tons. It formed not through a single expulsion from the volcanic vent, but rather by being shot upwards several times and then sliding back down into the crater, getting a new coating of lava and cinder each time until it got stuck at the edge of the crater and cooled permanently. It came to light in 1969 during blasting at a quarry on the volcanic cone, and in the winter of 1980 and 1981 was towed on an iron plate over a compacted layer of snow with a bulldozer into the village centre."

        "content": "As early as Roman times, there was a settlement at what is now Strohn named Struhna. The view into the distance from the Wartgesberg (mountain) as far as the Altburg and the heights of the Hunsr\u00fcck was used by the Romans, who built watchtowers on its heights. Emperor Heinrich VI, who was the great Emperor Barbarossa's son, transferred lordship over Struhna and the estate of Drucksbersch (Trautzberg) to Springiersbach Abbey. This monastery maintained a monasterial estate here with huge forest and land areas. The estate buildings stood in what is today's outlying centre of Sprink. Even today, Springiersbach's coat of arms can be found preserved on a house in Sprink. Among the places named in a confirmation document issued by Heinrich VI to Abbot Absalon von Springiersbach are cropfields and meadows at Struhna. In 1297, Count Heinrich of Luxembourg enfeoffed the knight Richard, Lord of Daun, with the tithes from Stroin. In 1299, the fief was expanded to include the whole village, which hitherto had only been an allodial holding. A newly built house \u2013 a fortified one \u2013 was owned in 1336 by Aegidius, Lord of Daun, who, because of this house, had to assume obligations to the Archbishop. In later centuries, the monastery's estate was forsaken. The lands and woods were sold off, and bought up by the villagers. The estate buildings in Sprink were acquired by three families. Even today, there are agricultural businesses being run there. In the Middle Ages, Strohn was also the site of a high court. In the 19th century, Strohn found itself under the lordship of the Count of Daun and thereby belonged to the County of Daun. A great fire struck the village in 1760, and it burnt down utterly. Only one house was left, the Justenhaus owned by the family Schmitz. Even the church's nave burnt down; only the tower remained standing. From inside, the old Marien Glocke (bell) still sounds. It bears the year 1483 and this inscription, in archaic German: Maria hei\u00dfen ich, alle Weder verdriffen ich Claus von Enen gos mich (\"Maria is my name, all weather I drive away, Claus von Enen poured me\"). During the time of French rule, Strohn was the seat of a mairie (\"mayoralty\") in the Canton of Manderscheid and the Arrondissement of Pr\u00fcm, and even into Prussian times, this was still a B\u00fcrgermeisterei (also \"mayoralty\"). On 22 August 1841, with ministerial permission, the B\u00fcrgermeisterei of Strohn was amalgamated with that of Gillenfeld. The B\u00fcrgermeisterei of Strohn included until 1841 Brockscheid, Immerath, mit dem Heckenhofe, M\u00fcckeln mit Schutzalf, Niederwinkel, Oberwinkel, Sprink, Trautzberg and Strotzb\u00fcsch. On the road from Strohn to M\u00fcckeln lies the Herrenb\u00fcsch where graves from Roman times can still be found. Some officers who were here on manoeuvres in 1875 had one such grave right at the roadside opened. Inside, they found jugs still filled with ashes, old coins, swords, amulets and lance heads."

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Tierced in mantle, dexter vert a lion's head couped Or langued gules, sinister vert a millstone argent surmounted by three ears of wheat laid per pall reversed of the second, in base argent balances of the third. The lion's head refers to Strohn's former status as a Springiersbach Abbey holding. The lion was a common charge in arms borne by abbots. Lions may still be seen in the sandstone coat of arms on a house in the outlying centre of Sprink, which was also a monasterial landholding, and on the hearth heating plate in the same house. The millstone and ears of wheat refer to Strohn's mills, of which one is still working today. The three ears also refer to agriculture, which is still important in the municipality. The balances are meant to stand for the high court at Strohn, belonging within whose jurisdiction were not only Strohn, but also M\u00fcckeln and Oberscheidweiler as well as the estates of Sprink and Trautzberg. The tinctures gules and argent (red and silver) stand for the Electorate of Trier; Strohn for centuries belonged to the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun. The tincture vert (green) in the two upper divisions was chosen to stand for the \"Strohn Switzerland\" (Strohner Schweiz) \u2013 the Strohner M\u00e4rchen and its scenic charm."

Although several union demands were contentious issues, the two main demands of the UAW Local 200 were \"union shop and checkoff,\" which became a rallying cry for the strikers. Negotiations for a new contract had spanned 18 months and officially ended with the exodus of Ford workers at 10 a.m. on the morning of September 12. The Strike included picketing and eventually led to a two-day blockade of vehicles surrounding the Ford plant on November 5. The strike ended on December 19 as both sides agreed to a temporary agreement proposal, while arbitration regarding the implementation of a fully unionized shop and medical coverage continued under Justice Ivan C. Rand. His report was released on January 29, 1946. The Rand Formula, as it became known, was one result of his report. This gave the UAW formal recognition as the sole negotiators representing all employees of Ford Motor Company. This changed both collective bargaining and labour relations by legitimizing unions."

        "content": "In August 1941 an agreement between the American UAW and Ford Motor Company had given American Ford workers union shop and checkoff. Ford did not extend these same provisions to their Canadian workers, this resulted in \"bad faith\" between the company and the Canadian UAW. Following the ratification of a company recognized UAW Canadian union on January 15, 1942, periodic work stoppages took place. In response to company continuance of making decisions as it had prior to the formalizing of the union, walkouts took place in November 1942, April 1943 and April-May 1944, these were all precursors of the Ford Strike of 1945. Throughout 1945 negotiations for a new company-union agreement were conducted. On January 22, 1945 the Ontario minister of Labour Charles Daley, upon request from the Ontario Labour relations Board, appointed Louis Fine as conciliation officer in an attempt to reach an agreement in the contentious negotiations. On March 28 Fine reported back stating: \"...in his opinion an agreement was impossible and the situation was very complicated and difficult.\" On August 31 Ford notified the union that 800 workers were to be laid off, on September 4 tensions were further exacerbated when an additional 1656 layoffs were projected to occur by September 14. Essentially these layoff announcements ended any hopes for a non-strike agreement to be reached. On the morning of September 12, 1945 at 10 a.m., after 18 months of failed negotiations, UAW workers took part in a wildcat strike leaving their work at the Ford plant in Windsor, Ontario. At a September 12 meeting at the Market Hall Windsor Mayor Art Reaume declared his support for the striking auto workers stating: \"Every member of my city council stands prepared to see that no man or woman is starved in this land of plenty. Heads have been smashed in other places by imported police, but let me pledge to you that it will not happen here.\" During the Ford Strike of 1945, a huge barricade of workers\u2019 cars and trucks were assembled on November 4, 1945 along Drouillard and Riverside. Some 1500 to 2000 vehicles reinforced the United Autoworkers picket line and prevented an violent assault by a joint force of  Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers. This police intervention resulted when the Windsor Police Commission (WPC) asked Ontario Attorney-General Leslie Blackwell for additional reinforcements, in an effort to aid in \"maintaining law and order.\" Mayor Reaume, based on his  support for the striking workers had opposed this action. Nonetheless, Blackwell approved the mobilization of 125 OPP officers into Windsor. In addition approximately another 125 RCMP officers were sent by the Government of Canada. The mobilization of some 250 OPP and RCMP officers authorized by Blackwell and Progressive Conservative Premier George Drew went against assurances they had made to Reaume, as David Moulton writes: \"that no police would be sent to Windsor.\" In addition the federal government was preparing armoured tank units in CFB Borden to break up the barricade. On November 5, Windsor City Council issued an ultimatum \"calling for the Ford strikers to remove the motor-car barricade outside the Ford plant or troops may be called in to remove the vehicles.\" Reaume consistently bucked decisions involving the use of police or force against the picket lines and others. United Auto Workers Local 200 President Roy England declared the WPC's recruitment and mobilization of the OPP and RCMP personnel  was an \"attempt at strikebreaking.\" In response Chrysler Local 195 voted to walkout in sympathy of the UAW Local 200 strike. The sympathy strike began 5 November 1945, this led to a mass exodus of workers from  twenty-five different plants, as a result another eight thousand workers flocked to the picket lines in support. Cross-Canada solidarity for the striking autoworkers was seen in places such as: Sarnia, Brantford, St. Catharines, Oshawa, Fort William, Ottawa, Kitchener, Hamilton, and even as far away as Nova Scotia. This support varied in nature, from rallies, to other UAW locals stopping work, to American locals sending financial aid."

While the Redbank area is known for its agricultural and pastoral origins, it has a more varied history. In the late 1850s, the first farmers in the area settled on the river flats situated to the north of the current railway station. This settlement featured a brickworks, sawmill, stores, cottages, a school and nondenominational church, though due to severe flooding, it was relocated south of the railway station some years later. In the early years, the rich black loamy soil of the plains supported crops of maize, potatoes and fodder, while cotton became a significant crop in the 1860s and 1870s. By the beginning of the 20th century, dairying became more important with the establishment of several creameries in the area. The late 1850s saw the establishment of the first secondary industry in the area, with a boiling down works and fellmongery owned by Mr John Campbell and Mr Town. Redbank's school was originally opened on July 1865 by the Roman Catholic Church on a  land parcel with an initial enrolment of 31 students. The building was used as both a school and a church. In 1881, it became Redbank State School. It closed on 30 September 1895, but reopened on 6 September 1897. In 1951, a further  of land was acquired to expand the school site. The Redbank - Bundamba Loop Line comprised a series of railway sidings serving coal mines in the area. Redbank Rifle Range operated from 1912 to 1980 south of the Redbank railway station. It was the home of a number rifle clubs over the years including Ipswich Railway Rifle Club, Ipswich City Rifle Club, Ipswich and District Rifle Club, which were invoved in competitive target shooting. The  firing mound was about  from the railway station with the targets  away (approx ). During World War II, there was a large military camp and training area at the range with up to 6,000 Australian and American troops. The development of the Ipswich Motorway reduced the length of the rifle range which led to the relocation of the Ipswich and District Rifle Club to South Ripley in 1972. The Redbank Railway Workshops has been operating in the suburb since 1958. The current Redbank Plaza Library was opened in 1998 and had a major refurbishment in 2010. In the , Redbank had a population of 1,834 people. Redbank had an unemployment rate of 14.5%, more than double the Australian unemployment rate of 6.9%."

There had been at least two prior observation towers on the site during the 19th century. One burned and another was destroyed during the infamous Portland Gale of 1897. It was agreed that the new tower should be more durable and made from stone and cement. The stone was quarried from the mountain itself. Funding was obtained primarily through entertainments staged in Shelburne Falls. The tower is 60 feet tall. Although the tower was originally constructed for recreational purposes, in 1911 the Massachusetts fire warden's department began using it as a fire lookout tower to watch for forest fires. A formal agreement was signed with the original private owners in 1912 to allow this use and the state was given further permission to construct an enclosed stone and glass cab at the top of the tower. This original cab was destroyed in 1947 by a lightning strike and fire. It was replaced by the state in 1967 with the present wood and glass cab. The tower now belongs to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and serves as an active fire tower operated by the Massachusetts Fire Marshall with the designation of Massachusetts State Tower #40.

There are remains of a Celtic cross of the period, and also part of an apparently Saxon doorway, but essentially the original church was late Norman in date.  By 1254 it belonged to the small priory of St. Kingsmark or Cynmarch. It was enlarged between 1813 and 1823, and extensive restoration work was carried out in the 1880s and again in the 1980s. The octagonal tower was the gift of local property-owner Nathaniel Wells. The village has a large village hall, the Memorial Hall, opened in 1924.  There is also a cast iron drinking fountain constructed in 1893.  The centre of the village is designated as a Conservation Area.

Licensed to Farmington, New Hampshire, the station's transmitter is located in New Durham, and studios are located in Rochester. The station serves the Portsmouth, New Hampshire area, and is currently owned by Educational Media Foundation. The station signed on in 1999 with a deep oldies format as WZEN, competing with WQSO. WZEN adopted the WMEX letters shortly after they were dropped by what is now WQOM (1060 AM) in 2001. The WMEX call letters, which were also used during the 1980s on what is now WWDJ (1150 AM) in Boston as well as WCLX in Westport, NY in the Burlington, VT market, refer to a popular top-40 station of the 1960s and 1970s on 1510 AM in Boston, Massachusetts (which has since reclaimed the WMEX call sign). In 2005, the station adjusted to hot AC as \"X106\", but returned to a more mainstream oldies format as \"106.5 WMEX\". On January 28, 2008, AllAccess.com reported that the station was in the process of being sold to the Educational Media Foundation for $1 million. When the sale was finalized, the station had been expected to change call letters and become the first New Hampshire affiliate of EMF's K-LOVE Christian contemporary music network. On June 2, 2008, the station went out with the Righteous Brothers' \"Rock n Roll Heaven\" as its last tune. While the station changed its call letters to WKHL, implying that it would join K-LOVE, the station ended up joining sister network Air 1 instead. A few weeks later, the call sign was again changed, this time to the current WNHI. The WMEX call sign was subsequently assigned to a construction permit for a station at 88.7\u00a0MHz in Edgartown, MA (now WMVY), and is now used on WMEX-LP (105.9 FM) in Rochester and WMEX (1510 AM) in Boston."

Built by Marc Seguin and his brothers, it crossed the Seine to the \u00cele Saint-Louis.  It was opened to traffic one year later, on 26 July 1834.  After the French Revolution of 1848 (during which the bridge and its tollhouses were burnt down), it was restored and renamed \"Pont de la R\u00e9forme\", a name it held until 1852. In the face of increased traffic (the tollhouses had not been restored), it was demolished to be replaced by the present structure in 1860.  This new structure, an arch bridge, was built by the engineers, Edmond-Jules F\u00e9line-Romany and Jules Savarin, between August 1860 and April 1862, a little further upstream than its predecessor.   The Pont Louis-Philippe was inaugurated in April 1862.  The spandrels above the four-metre-wide piers in the Seine are decorated with stone laurel wreaths surrounding metallic rosettes. The only modification since then (unlike its much-modified contemporary, the Pont de Bercy) was the replacement of the stone guardrails (badly damaged by pollution) with replica railings in 1995."

The settlement and port of Abu Hail were bombarded on 18 January 1820 by British forces during the Persian Gulf campaign of 1819, following the fall of Ras Al Khaimah. The action resulted in the General Maritime Treaty of 1820, which led to the recognition of the coastal emirates as the Trucial States and, eventually, to the formation of the United Arab Emirates in December 1971. By the turn of the 20th century, Abu Hail was effectively abandoned and only occupied, by people from both Al Khan and Dubai, during the date harvest."

Tsaghkavank overlooks the village of Lichk, and the remaining lower walls are cylindrical walls with a very small entry. The reasoning behind this is that one would technically be forced to bow in respect upon entering the church. The church of St. Astvatsatsin is a small basilica with some broken khachkars and gravestones embedded into its walls. It is currently in disrepair as the roof has collapsed. Surrounding the two churches is a 13th-century cemetery with numerous interesting khachkars. Nearby is a cyclopean fort. Between 1950\u201360, an Aramaic inscription was found nearby."

Many had used the naturally carbonated spring daily, as a main source of drinking water or in hopes of curing certain ailments. A contract was secured through the local government by a businessman to construct a bottling plant at the site to produce soft drinks. Construction began in early-August and the dome of the spring, created by minerals in the water, was destroyed. Residents protested the move made by the local government and took back control of their water source.  Restoration efforts were soon underway so that residents could once again use the source of water again. On June 12, 2015 the artesian well was uncapped through the  efforts of residents in Lichk and is once again open for use."

After Crete fell to the Republic of Venice, the settlement became known as the Castel Vecchio or Antico Castello, which both mean \"old castle.\" Under Venetian rule, a small harbour was built in Rethymno, which became the third most important city on Crete after Heraklion and Chania. On 8 April 1540, a line of fortifications began to be built around the city. The walls were designed by the architect Michele Sanmicheli, and were completed in around 1570.

Since Rethymno had been sacked, it was decided that new fortifications needed to be built to protect the city and its harbour. The new fortress, which was built on the Paleokastro hill, was designed by the military engineer Sforza Pallavicini according to the Italian bastioned system. Construction began on 13 September 1573, and it was complete by 1580. The fortress was built under the master builder Giannis Skordilis, and a total of 107,142 Cretans and 40,205 animals took part in its construction. Although the original plan had been to demolish the old fortifications of Rethymno and move the inhabitants into the Fortezza, it was too small to house the entire city. The walls along the landward approach to the city were left intact, and the Fortezza became a citadel housing the Venetian administration of the city. It was only to be used by the inhabitants of the city in the case of an Ottoman invasion. Over the years, a number of modifications were made to the fortress. Nonetheless, it was never truly secure as it lacked a ditch and outworks, and the ramparts were rather low."

At the top of the Hencote downhill gradient, freight trains of Class 5 (modern equivalent Class 7) such as this one were required to obey a stop sign, but the train passed the sign and entered the Coton Hill goods loop at speed. Despite emergency brake applications being made, the train eventually derailed on the trap points at the exit of the goods yard and continued for a further 70 yards before finally crashing into the Coton Hill South signal box, destroying it completely. The first 11 wagons followed the locomotive, but the destruction of the signal box opened a set of points which sent 24 further wagons into a siding, where they derailed and some collided with a second Class 47 diesel which was waiting to leave the yard. The destruction was widespread and the cleanup operation was further hampered by hydrochloric acid leaking from a damaged wagon.  Normal service was not restored until 14 January."

        "content": "The Department of Transport inquiry found that, due to the damage caused to the locomotive and train (the locomotive was later scrapped, despite being only 8 months old), it was impossible to ascertain whether a brake failure had impaired the driver's ability to stop the train.  However, the driver was found to be responsible for the accident, as had he stopped at the top of the incline, as was required, he would have been able to stop the train even if a brake failure had occurred.  The driver did not have any recollection of the accident, and it was thought logical that he had assumed that the points were set for the main line and not the goods loop. When the locomotive was being broken up some months later, it was found that its Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment had been isolated, despite appearing to be in working order.  The driver would therefore have had no warning that the points were set for the goods loop ahead, though given the failure to stop, this would probably not have prevented the accident."

Bammel, eighteen miles north of downtown Houston at the intersection of Farm-to-Market Road 1960 (FM 1960) and Kuykendahl Road in north central Harris County, was established after the neighboring towns of Klein, Westfield, and Spring. It was named for Charles Bammel, a German Houstonian who built the Bammel and Kuehnle Merchandise store with his partner in 1915 and moved to the community for health reasons. A Bammel post office, at which Herman Kuehnle was the first postmaster, operated from 1916 until 1929. Bammel's store burned in 1927 but was later rebuilt to serve the new Bammel Forest subdivision. The town's population was reported as roughly fifty from 1929 until oil was discovered in the area in 1938. In 1943 the community reported two stores and a population of 200, but in 1949 its population was estimated at twenty. During the 1980s Bammel's residents were mainly commuters who worked in Houston. The community included two shopping centers, several schools, a hospital, and nearby cemeteries."

        "content": "The location of the venue was decided in January 1990, following Lillehammer's successful bid to host the 1994 Winter Olympics. Construction was managed by the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC). Architects were 2\u00d8 Arkitekter and the main consultant was Tonning & Lieng. Construction started in early 1991, before planning was completed, and lasted until 1993. The construction work was subcontracted to several companies. Landscaping was completed in 1994. The facilities used concrete and wood as the main materials. The stadium included  of temporary buildings, a  building converted to a riding center after the Olympics, and a  tent. The land around the venue is a swamp, and most of the surface soil had to be removed and replaced with harder earth. The soil was used as fertilizer or fill in other parts of the arena. A creek had to be bypassed with a  long pipe. The arena is also so flat that a drainage system had to be installed. After the Olympics, four temporary overpasses were removed. Construction of the tracks was done to minimize the impact on the forest. The venue cost NOK\u00a083.6 million, and was inaugurated on 28 November 1992 with an international biathlon competition. In December 1992, the LOOC stated that they wanted to upgrade the stadium spectator capacity, but that the transport systems would not allow more people. In 1993, the stadium had World Cup tournaments in biathlon and cross-country skiing as a trial before the Olympics. During several events, the computer system controlling the scoreboard and television scores collapsed. President Johan Baumann of the Norwegian Ski Federation criticized the venue and demanded that a new stadium be built. He stated that the stadium had been built to optimize television pictures, and that it had insufficient facilities for the spectators. In particular, he criticized the fact that the spectators were too far away from the skiers and the lack of a television screen and more scoreboards. In May, the LOOC announced that the stadium would be expanded for another 6,000 people before the Olympics. On 7 September, the ownership of the venue was transferred from the LOOC to Lillehammer Municipality via the subsidiary Lillehammer Olympiavekst, which later changed its name to Lillehammer Olympiapark. In October, the forest along the tracks were partially cleared to allow spectators without tickets to watch the events."

In 1936 construction of an air field for the Luftwaffe was completed. However, no permanent buildings and structures were erected, indicating that there were no plans for a permanent air field. The base was used during World War II by several Luftwaffe units including night fighters. After the end of World War II  the air field was abandoned. Beginning in 1957 works started to convert the former air force base into an air base to house units of the recently formed German Army's Aviation Corps, utilising the facilities of the previous occupant. These final works were completed in 1962 after which numerous units were stationed at Niederstetten Air Base. Currently, the air base is home of Army Aviation Transport Helicopter Regiment 30 of the German Army. The regiment, which was relocated to Niederstetten in 1980, was part of German Army's Airmobile Operations Division, the division's headquarters being in Veitsh\u00f6chheim. The division was dissolved in 2014, and Army Aviation Transport Helicopter Regiment 30 was subsequently integrated into Rapid Forces Division. Approximately 750 members of the armed forces are at present employed at the air base. However, due to further restructuring within the German Army Aviation Corps this number was increased by 600 in 2011. Army Aviation Transport Helicopter Regiment 30 is equipped with helicopters of the type Bell UH-1D. These helicopters are being replaced by medium-sized NH90s, 32 of which will be stationed at Niederstetten Air Base. To accommodate the new aircraft an extensive building program started in 2007, the first result of which was the completion of a hangar to house 8 helicopters of the type NH90 in February 2008. The air base is also used for civilian purposes, particularly for business flights and recreational purposes. In order to comply with EU regulations and to retain permission for civilian use, the runway was extended by 200 metres in 2011. To accommodate the new aircraft an extensive building program started in 2007."

        "content": "South Congress (abbreviated SoCo) is a neighborhood located on South Congress Avenue in Austin, Texas, United States. It is also a nationally known shopping and cultural district known for its many eclectic small retailers, restaurants, music and art venues and, more recently, food trucks. South Congress begins at the Colorado River and Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge and runs due south towards Ben White Boulevard/TX-71. The area bordered by two historic South Austin neighborhoods: Travis Heights to the east and Bouldin Creek to the west. Since its humble beginnings in the 1850s, South Congress Avenue has been transformed from a rural country road to the capital city gateway and, finally, to the shopping district that it is today. Some Austinites attribute its enduring popularity to the unobstructed view of the Texas State Capitol."

        "content": "Edwin Waller designed Congress to be Austin's most prominent thoroughfare in the 1830s. However, Congress did not extend south of the Colorado River until 1852 when James Gibson Swisher donated land for a road that was both the postal route to Austin and the main highway to San Antonio. Growth along South Congress slowed during the 19th century; it was not until the completion of a concrete bridge in 1910 that South Austin had reliable transportation over the river. Rapid growth finally came to South Austin in the 1920s, as the streetcar was expended down South Congress. As hundreds of bungalows were built in South Austin, more commercial enterprises began appearing south of the river - especially on South Congress. By 1931, South Congress was finally paved all the way from the river to the railroad at present-day Ben White Boulevard. Many of South Congress's icons opened their doors between 1930 and 1960. The Austin Motel opened in 1938 and the Hotel San Jos\u00e9 shortly thereafter. The hamburger stand that would eventually become the legendary Night Hawk opened on South Congress in 1932. Another major development was the Twin Oaks Shopping Center at the northeast corner of Oltorf Road and South Congress. It was one of Austin's first \"strip\" shopping venues when it opened in 1954. South Austin opened further during the 1950s, as the Congress Avenue Bridge was widened and the construction of Interstate 35 provided an alternative north\u2013south route. During the 1970s, South Congress became a mecca for artists, musicians and their supporters. The legendary Armadillo World Headquarters opened at the corner of South Congress and Barton Springs Boulevard in 1970. Tourist traffic declined on South Congress with the rise of I-35 and many businesses fell into disrepair. By the late 1980s, small eclectic retailers began popping up along the South Congress Corridor, attracted by cheap rent. The area's renaissance began at the intersection of South Congress and Monroe by putting their historic buildings to good use to attract eclectic retail business, arts and music venues and restaurants to the area. South Austin's first skyscrapers appeared at South Congress and Riverside Drive when two new hotels opened. 1988 was a watershed moment for the area, as Kent Cole and Diana Prechter fixed a beat-up wood-frame building that had operated as Flossie's bar and the Austex Lounge, and reopened it as Magnolia Cafe South. Said they were attracted by the \"colorful people\" and cheap rent. Memories of drug dealers and prostitutes began to fade in the 1990s. Austin, a relatively small city for most of its history, suddenly enjoyed a tremendous economic boom that attracted new residents and drove an increased demand for older housing stock in the Travis Heights and Bouldin Creek neighborhoods. That in turn spurred massive renovation along South Congress and throughout old South Austin. The 1990s witnessed the redevelopment of the Austin Theatre, the H-E-B at Oltorf and South Congress and more. Perhaps the most ambitious renovation undertaken was the redevelopment of Penn Field from an industrial plant to a multi-use complex that includes office space, retail and residences. By the end of the decade, South Congress was well on its way to becoming a nationally known shopping and cultural district."

        "content": "The park was originally established in 1900 as Taihoku New Park(\u81fa\u5317\u65b0\u516c\u5712) during the Japanese colonial period, on former temple grounds. It was the first European-style urban park in Taiwan, placed on the grounds of the Governor-General's Office. In 1930, Taiwan's Japanese authorities established a radio station at the site designed by Kuriyama Shunichi (\u6817\u5c71\u4fca\u4e00). The station initially housed the Taihoku Broadcasting Bureau, an arm of the Government-General Propaganda Bureau's Information Office. The following year, the Taiwan Broadcast Association was formed to handle island-wide broadcasts. The Taihoku Park radio station became the center of broadcast activity for the Association. In 1935, it was one of the sites used for The Taiwan Exposition: In Commemoration of the First Forty Years of Colonial Rule. After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, the park was subsequently renamed Taipei New Park by the government. They renamed the broadcasting agency the Taiwan Broadcasting Company. The station became the primary broadcast organ of the Kuomintang government and military. In 1947, a group of protesters, angry over a brutal police action against Taiwanese civilians, took over the station and used it to broadcast accusations against the Kuomintang government. The action formed part of a chain of events now referred to as the February 28 Incident. A subsequent, more severe crackdown by the Nationalist government restored the station to Kuomintang control and ushered in  Taiwan's period of white terror. Two years later, the Kuomintang lost ground in the Chinese Civil War and its leaders retreated to Taiwan. Trying to establish themselves as China's true national government in exile, they renamed the bureau the Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC). The Taipei City government took over operation of the radio station building when the BCC moved in 1972. City officials made it the site of the Taipei City Government Parks and Street Lights Office. As Taiwan entered its modern democracy period in the 1990s, President Lee Teng-hui offered an official apology in 1995 and invited free discussion of Taiwan's past. For the first time the February 28 Incident of 1947 was officially acknowledged and its significance openly debated. In 1996, the Taipei City Government designated the former radio station building a historical site. Two years later, the building was made the home of the Taipei 228 Memorial Museum and the park was rededicated as 228 Peace Memorial Park. The 228 Memorial Monument was designed by Taiwanese architect Cheng Tzu-tsai, who was convicted of attempted murder in 1971 following a 1970 assassination attempt on Chiang Ching-kuo. After serving his sentence, he was imprisoned for illegal entry to Taiwan in 1991 and filed his design entry from prison. The Monument is inscribed with an exhortation for peace and unity. On 25 November 2019, the museum was declared as a cultural asset by the Bureau of Cultural Heritage."

As of November 16, 2013, Chester State Park also offers the first SC State Park tournament sanctioned disc golf course.  This 27 hole course has three loops suitable for professional, tournament play with 18 of these holes having alternative tee's for beginner/amateur level players. Lakeview Hall, a fully enclosed meeting facility overlooking the park lake, is regularly used for weddings, reunions, and corporate meetings. Boy Scouts, church groups, and many other organized groups frequent the primitive group camping area throughout the year. Chester State Park's 25-site campground is open year-round and has many sites that may accommodate anything from single tents to  RVs."

Its territorial area is 2 207,612 square kilometers, the headquarters's area occupyin 2 174 square kilometers, have altitude of 454 meters. According to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2020 its population was estimated at 67,335 inhabitants. The Human Development Index (HDI) is 0.656 (average). A survey by the Federation of Industries of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FIRJAN) found that Brumado is considered to be the sixth most developed municipality in Bahia, based on the FIRJAN Municipal Development Index (IFDM 2013) published in 2015. A query made exclusively by Urban Systems, in January 2016, for Exame Magazine, concluded that the city is among the 100 best in Brazil to invest, ranking 84th in the ranking, totaling 2 306 points. A study carried out by IBGE, in 2012, concluded that of the 64 602 inhabitants, 50 899 were literate, 31 747 were men and 32 855 were women. The per capita income was R$12,144.11, and in distribution between rural and urban areas, in the private households in the rural area, it was R$217.00, and in the urban area it was R$333.33. The fleet of motor vehicles, such as road transport, including motorcycles, as well as tractors and trucks totaled 31 000. The city is notorious as the \"Capital of Ore\", Because it has a large amount of minerals in its subsoil, which is the basis of its economy, and has large mining companies that carry out their extractive activities in Serra das \u00c9guas. (Das \u00c9guas Mountain), which, by the way, also is one of the tourist points of the municipality, to form mountainous landscapes. Brumado makes municipal boundaries with Livramento de Nossa Senhora, Dom Bas\u00edlio, Aracatu, Rio de Contas, Malhada de Pedras, Tanha\u00e7u, Itua\u00e7u, Rio do Ant\u00f4nio, Lagoa Real and Cara\u00edbas.

According to Teodoro Fernandes Sampaio, the name \"Brumado\" originates from a Tupi expression: Itimbopira (Y-timb\u00f3-pyra), which means misty, covered with haze. According to Jose Dias, former priest of the region, the name originates as fog in the morning descends from the mountains to the north, Serra Geral and Chapada Diamantina, covering the city. Another theory says the origin of the name Brumado is attributed to the word bromo - a word that during the times of mining in the Brumado River was used by the miners and bandeirantes to distinguish loss or deception, mystification or disappearance of the gold in the mining or stream that was supposedly rich in that ore."

It was the first part taken and was named \"Conquest\", then founded a farm called Serra das \u00c9guas. Although these Indians strongly resisted the attacks of the captain and his group, they gradually dispersed, troubled by the presence of white men. In the future, the Serra das \u00c9guas farm was acquired by Jo\u00e3o Antunes Moreira, who in turn left for his son, the catholic priest Andr\u00e9 Antunes da Maia; who finally sold it on June 30, 1749 to Jos\u00e9 de Souza Meira, son of Francisco de Souza Meira, for $462,700 (1 million, 462 thousand and 700 r\u00e9is), with 232 heads of cattle, 105 heads of equine cattle and a slave named Manuel. In this way, the lands returned to the hands of the Meiras. In 1755, Campo Seco farm was bought by the Portuguese Miguel Louren\u00e7o de Almeida (family of the Holy Office), a clan of the Cangu\u00e7u family in the municipality. The Serra das \u00c9guas farm was near the area that is today the city of Brumado. It was located on the south side, lower part of a mountain range, today called Serra das \u00c9guas, known for the deposits of magnesite and mineral talc. Over the years, a small settlement grew more or less ten kilometers by the same margin of the river, thanks to the successes of the adventurers who worked hard to farm and To livestock, giving life to the town that would later be the seat of the municipality."

On June 19, 1869, still under the name of Bom Jesus dos Meiras, the then vice president of the province of Bahia, Ant\u00f4nio Ledeslau de Figueiredo Rocha, signed Provincial Decree-Law No. 1091, thus transforming Bom Jesus dos Meiras in a district of the same name, annexing it to Caetit\u00e9, who was already emancipated. Soon after, Ant\u00f4nio Pinheiro Pinto Cangu\u00e7u, the second master of Sobrado do Brejo, contributed financially and with labor to build the Chapel of Bom Jesus, attending the requests of the inhabitants; Today, the old chapel is the mother church of Brumado, that at that time was called Church Senhor do Bonfim, in honor of the patron of the city, Bom Jesus, and had like first vicar the priest Jose Mariano Meira Rocha. Bom Jesus dos Meiras separated from Caetit\u00e9 in 1877, receiving the title of village. The author of the project was a deputy from the province of Bahia, Marcolino Moura. The political leader at that time was Colonel Exup\u00e9rio Pinheiro Cangu\u00e7u, the fourth and last lord of Sobrado do Brejo. Political emancipation occurred on June 11, 1877, with the creation of Provincial Law n \u00b0 1756. The first City Council of Bom Jesus dos Meiras was created on February 13, 1878, composed of the following persons listed below and their Respective positions: President: Colonel Exup\u00e9rio Pinheiro Cangu\u00e7u; Secretary: Belarmino Jacundes Lobo; Prosecutor: Rufiniano de Moura Amorim; Supervisor: Pl\u00e1cido Guedes d'Oliveira; Porter: Francisco Alves Piranha. In 1948, Armindo dos Santos Azevedo took office as the first mayor elected by direct vote. The merchant and cattle rancher was elected in three terms: 1948 - 1950, 1955 - 1958 and 1963 - 1966. In its management, the municipality achieved great advances, such as water supply, electricity and paving of many streets and squares in the city center. The energy in Brumado in the 1940s to 1970s only worked until 9:30\u00a0p.m. It was from then on that the energy began to function in an integral way. In 1962, the districts of Santa B\u00e1rbara dos Casados, Olhos d'\u00c1gua and S\u00e3o Pedro would have their toponyms changed to Ubira\u00e7aba, Itaquara\u00ed and Aracatu, respectively. From 1967 to 1970, the mayor was elected doctor Juracy Pires Gomes, with the support of partner Armindo dos Santos Azevedo. In his mandate important works were carried out, such as the new city hall, the new municipal market, the city's first public library; The main one was the dam of the River of the ant\u00f4nio that would supply the city until the year 2010."

        "content": "At the beginning of the 20th century, the economy was based on agriculture: large-scale cotton farming, coffee and cereals, and cattle raising, goats, sheep and cattle, favoring the export of sheep skins raw or tanned, dry leather and salty, as well as lump cotton and live cattle. Cotton was the culture that most contributed to the economic development of the municipality. Between 1930 and 1955, the production was so great that the producers started to benefit it in the field even using handmade machines. Faced with the success of cotton growing, modern cotton factories were installed in the city. The municipality had six plants in operation. Since 1980, the crop has declined, due to several factors, as an interruption of financial aid by the government, (such as crop insurance), cotton boll weevil (pests that destroy crops), high interest rates for production financing, and of the processing. Currently, the production of passion fruit has been outstanding, in the district of Itaquara\u00ed, one of the largest production locations in Brazil. In 1930, two important events marked the economic history of the municipality: the arrival of the mining company Magnesita S.A., founded by two French friends naturalized Brazilian and resident in Brazil, Miguel Pierre Cahen and Georges Louis Minviele - in partnership with Ant\u00f4nio Mour\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es -, a politician of the time, and the construction of the Federal Railroad Network (RFFSA), which would facilitate the transportation of the newly discovered ore to the port of Aratu in Salvador. Both events occurred in 1939. The Magnesita company was authorized to operate in 1940 through Decree n\u00ba 6220 and since then, it has exploited most of the magnesite and mineral talc reserves contained in Serra das \u00c9guas. In the 1970s Brumado arrived at the Brazilian Refractory Products Industries (IBAR S.A.). The company interested in extracting magnesite has established its facilities in the northern part of the saw. In the following years, the municipality witnessed great changes, such as large-scale population growth, construction of houses and commercial establishments. Faced with this great attraction, people from other cities were arriving, commerce strengthened, and the city of Brumado became known by recent events. To the south of the former Serra das \u00c9guas farm was formed a kind of closed condominium: the Catiboaba village; The Presidente Get\u00falio Vargas village was also formed around the company, fruit of the flow of workers who came from the most varied places to work in the mines of magnesite and mineral talc. In 1969, it was the turn of Xilolite S.A., which also settled on the north side of the mountain range and has since exploited magnesite and mineral talc, with the acquisition of one of the mines in 1973. In 1993, Matsulfur, a cement factory, later acquired by Lafarge, under the name Cement Brumado, today Cimpor, Cimento de Portugal (Cement of Portugal), belonging to InterCement (Camargo Corr\u00eaa Group)."

The relief of Brumado is very bumpy, presenting mountainous areas denominated mountains and/or altomontanas, like the Mares sierra (Serra das \u00c9guas) and Black stone hill (Morro da Pedra Preta). There are also level areas, which are flat and / or wavy forms, which make the transition between the upper and lower areas, forming species of stairs. Also has flat and flat relief shapes. In general, the Brumadian relief is quite rugged, slightly undulating and presents erosions due to the floods, favorable characteristics for biodiversity, contributing to a wide variety of species, both in flora and fauna. The municipality of Brumado is part of the De Contas River basin and the Of Ant\u00f4nio River sub-basin, which also includes the municipalities of Cacul\u00e9, Rio do Ant\u00f4nio, Lic\u00ednio de Almeida, Guajeru and Malhada de Pedras. The main drains of the Do Contas River basin are: Brumado River, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o River, Santa Maria Stream, River of the ant\u00f4nio and Gavi\u00e3o River; The main tributaries of River of the ant\u00f4nio are: Paiol River, Do Salto River and Do Quirino Stream. The Ant\u00f4nio River Basin has an area of 6,540 square kilometers. Two of the great tributaries are born in very different places: the Brumado River, affluent of the Contas, is born in the Saw of souls (Serra das Almas) and River of the ant\u00f4nio in General Saw (Serra Geral), in the municipality of Lic\u00ednio de Almeida. In De Contas River is inserted the dam of Cristal\u00e2ndia Which supplies the city, and in River of the ant\u00f4nio, the dam of the River of the ant\u00f4nio, which supplied the urban population by 2010. Most rivers are temporary, such as River of the ant\u00f4nio and S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o River. The De Contas River Basin has annual precipitation between 700 and 800\u00a0mm, with little possibility of major floods. The average temperature is 22\u00a0\u00b0C. It is characterized by two biomes: Caatinga and Atlantic Forest (Mata Atl\u00e2ntica), which have suffered deforestation, to give way to agriculture and urbanization. It covers an area of 4 477.62 square kilometers. The municipality that most demands water from the basin is Jequi\u00e9. The sub basin of the Of Ant\u00f4nio River has suffered over time with water degradation, due to the intense pollution of its waters, deforestation of the riparian forests and the excess of dams that are built. The main drainage of the sub basin, the river of the same name, has as its main function human supply, with minimum use for irrigation."

In these areas, the rocks are formed by metavulcanic sequences, that is to say of very old volcanic actions, which favored the formation of metamorphic rocks of a great quantity of minerals, metals and nonmetals such as iron, manganese, emeralds, quartz, granites and different types of ornamental stones. The chart below shows the main occurrences of minerals in the Brumadian basin and their corresponding percentages. In geochronology studies it was verified that the oldest rock formations of South America, with the age of 3.4 to 3.5 billion years, are between the municipalities of Brumado and Vit\u00f3ria da Conquista. In the geological scale, the soil is from the Paleoproterozoic Age or the Lower Proterozoic Age, equivalent to 1.6 and 2.5 Gigaannum. It was at this age that the oldest rocks and the richest soils in any and every type of ore were formed. This explains why Serra das \u00c9guas (Das \u00c9guas Saw) is so rich in minerals. In addition to magnesite, Brumadian soil contains all these minerals already mentioned above, which leads us to conclude that it is one of the richest soils in Brazil and one of the oldest in the world, making it one of the most studied by geologists."

        "content": "Along the municipality, there are four types of vegetation existing in all Brazilian territorial extent: Ciliar Forest, Cerrado, Rupestre Field and Caatinga, which is the predominant vegetation. In the ridges of the hills and mountains, such as Das \u00c9guas Saw and Da Pedra Preta Hill, and on the banks of the rivers are closed and small tropical forests, called \"generals\". Campos rupestres, vegetation typical of montane and higmontanes environments, occur at altitudes above 900 m, as is the case again in the Das \u00c9guas Saw and Da Pedra Preta Hill; Is characterized by the predominance of shrubs and/or herbaceous plants, precisely in the mountainous summits of the mountains. The species occurring in the Caatinga are very diversified, some with important commercial and ecological value, such as aroeira (Astronium urundeuva) and bra\u00fana, or bara\u00fana (Schinopsis brasiliensis), angico and black angico (Anadenanthera macrocarpa) and umbuzeiro (Spondias tuberosa), one of the which is protected by Municipal Law No. 1030 of 1992. Other notable species are the juazeiro and jatob\u00e1, and other species: cassutinga (Caesalpinia microphylla), black maria (Vitex sp.), umburana or northeastern cumaru (Amburana cearensis), white jurema (Mimosa sp.), among many other creeping and shrub plant. Although the municipality has small forest islands called Riparian Forests, often located on the banks of the rivers and streams of the region, the fauna is composed of animals adapted to the Caatinga. Animal biodiversity often ends up having its natural habitat threatened by miners, ranchers and hunters, who aim at territorial expansion, exploitation of natural resources and also illegal trade in animals; Consequently, it ends up entailing a predatory activity unrestrained and without any control with respect to the ecological imbalance that this action can cause. Brumado has a very wide biodiversity, both vegetal and animal, ranging from small specimens to medium-sized animals threatened with extinction. In the fauna, a reasonable amount of mammals prevails; At least 148 species were cataloged in the interior of the municipality and in the surrounding regions, practically all threatened with extinction. They are distributed between Cerrado and Caatinga; As the highlight is the puma known as su\u00e7uarana (or Jaguarundi), being one of the species most endangered and the mocca (Kerodon rupestris), because it is endemic (exclusive of the region). Other examples are: caatinga deer, armadillo or tatupeba (Euphractus), paca (Agouti paca), possum (Conepatus semistriata), fox and raccoon (Dusicyon thous), mallard cat or puma yagouaroundi (Herpailurus yaguaroundi), ferret (Galictis vittatus), coati (Nasua nassua), among others. Disordered hunting of these animals for food consumption is the factor that most contributes to putting animals on the extinction list. There are also a myriad of birds that are part of the fauna; Most of them are targeted by breeders and collectors, favoring the trafficking of these animals. Among the most common and well-known are: canary, quail, partridge, northeastern cardinal (Paroaria dominicana), Caatinga bacural (Chordeiles pusillus), canan crow (Cyanocorax cyanopogon), mustache(Sporophila lineola), cowgirl-heron (Bubulcus ibis), Great Blue Heron (Casmerdius albus), garrincha (Thryothorus genibarbis), seriema (Cariama cristata), fire sanha\u00e7o (Piranga flava), blackbird or coqui (Gnorimopsar chopi ), white anu (Guira guira), black anu (Crotophaga ani), woodpecker (Dryocopus lineatus), crack iron (Saltador simillis), vi-vi or fim-fim (Euphonia clorotica) Caatinga (Aratinga cactorum), sofr\u00ea (Icterus jamacaii), canary of the kingdom, canary of the earth, sabi\u00e1 and many others. Due to size, quail and partridge are hunted constantly inside the municipality. The species of amphibians and reptiles present in the local fauna are small animals, like calango (Tropidurus torquatus). Of these species, the green calango (Ameiva ameiva) is the most commonly seen because it has no commercial value, is not edible, nor is venomous. The tei\u00fa (Tupinambis merianae) and the armadillo are well-hunted animals. The best-known snake species are rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus) and jararaca (Bothrops jararaca), both are venomous."

Nevertheless, many who attend catholic cults also attend cults of religions of African matrices, such as umbanda and candombl\u00e9. In Brazil, all who are baptized in the Catholic Church are considered Catholic, even if they practice another religion. In Brumado, in 2012, according to data from the IBGE, 50 869 people professed Catholicism, 7 422 identified themselves as evangelicals and 994 people identified themselves as spiritists. Of those who professed umbanda or candombl\u00e9, they were not even mentioned; But this does not mean that religions of African matrices are not present. There are no numbers on these religions in Brumado, but they do exist, and there is information in the city that is the largest center of candombl\u00e9 in the world, in the shape of a castle. For Catholics, they have the traditional processions, such as the procession of St. Sebastian, patron saint of the city. Since 1960, every January 20, Catholic faithful have celebrated St. Sebastian's Day, walking several streets in the city center. It is also celebrated the Day of Santa Rita, with processions. Many other religious manifestations are held, mostly by Catholics and sympathizers. For evangelicals, the greatest festive religious event is the March for Jesus, which usually takes place in September. Many evangelicals gather in the center of the city to fraternize with their brothers to the sound of gospel music. Also on Evangelical Day, June 11, which coincides with the date of Brumado's birthday, supporters celebrate in a double dose, reconciling the dates to the two celebrations, with musical shows"

The municipal administration is in charge of the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch. Until 1930, the Brazilian municipalities were governed by the mayor of the corresponding municipality, called intendants or executive agents. After the Revolution of 1930, the municipal powers were divided between executive and legislative. In 1877, the provincial deputy Marcolino Moura elaborated a project calling for the political emancipation of Brumado, then called Bom Jesus dos Meiras. Brumado, then, emancipated himself from Caetit\u00e9 at the time of coronelism, on June 11 of that year. The city council was created on January 13 of the following year, when Colonel Exup\u00e9rio Pinheiro Cangu\u00e7u, the fourth and last lord of Sobrado do Brejo, became the first intendant. Currently Brumado is part of the 90th electoral zone of Bahia with more than 66 061 voters, counting with the voters of the municipalities of Aracatu and Malhada de Pedras, of which 47 845 are in Brumado. The legislative chamber is composed of 13 councilors elected from among the 72 candidates who ran in the 2012 elections. To better serve the electorate, the new headquarters of the electoral forum was inaugurated in 2013."

In 2006, the Superintendency of Economic and Social Studies of Bahia (SEI) published data, where agriculture and cattle raising appeared in that year with only 5.04% of the municipal GDP. Although this sector has a minimal contribution, it can highlight some important activities. In agriculture, crops such as cotton stand out, with 800 hectares planted and harvested; Beans with 2 000 hectares planted and harvested; ricinus or mamona, 200 hectares planted and harvested; watermelon 350 hectares, planted and harvested; And umbu, which is cultivated naturally, without human intervention, for being native, therefore, present in all extension of the municipality. Other low-productivity crops are: mango, with 25 hectares planted and harvested, and coconut-bay with 20 hectares planted and harvested. These data are from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in 2014. In livestock, cattle with 45 105 heads and galiform with a total of 87,654 heads, 37,657 heads of chickens. The goats totaled 29,654 heads; Sheep, 13 534 heads; 16 326 heads, according to IBGE data in 2014. According to the (SEI), in 2006 the industry accounted for 52.31% of the municipality's GDP. This percentage is obtained as a function of mineral extractive activities by the companies Magnesita S.A., Xilolite S.A., Ibar Nordeste S.A. and Cimento Cimpor. Mining is the largest source of wealth in the municipality and generates employment for the majority of the population. Brumado has rich deposits of magnesite, mineral talc and other minerals such as vermiculite, dolomite, rock crystal and granites of the most varied types. The mineral magnesite is the main product of the mining industry, and of all the mines of this open-air ore existing in the world, Brumado is the third largest. It also has the second largest mineral talc mine in Brazil."

However, mineral extraction potential is not added to 5.04% of the primary sector, but to the secondary sector; If this happened, the primary sector would have a higher percentage. The miners, in addition to extracting the primary resources, manufacture some products for direct consumption, such as medicinal talc, cosmetic talc and processed mineral talc for the manufacture of pulp and an infinity of products for consumption in agribusiness. Given that 52.31% of municipal GDP is mixed with extraction and transformation, it is assumed that this percentage is technically divided between the secondary sector and the primary sector."

Service companies that performed federal and state works beginning in 2011 employed large numbers of people, including from other municipalities. The largest employers of these companies were Grupo Andrade Gutierrez and VALEC, responsible for the construction of the West-East Integration Railway (FIOL). Until 2013, these companies and their subcontractors played an important role in the local economy, in addition to the miners who invested in their facilities between 2011 and 2015, generating employment for the city's population and also for other neighboring cities.91 In the 2014 and 2015, some companies that provided services to the State had their works suspended several times, which caused financial insecurity for employees and for commerce. Service delivery has a greater share absorbed by the mining industry, either by constant services, or by temporary services resulting from casual investments. Civil construction has also contributed a lot to economic growth and since 2009, projects have been carried out and, although they slowed down in 2015, the city still sees works being carried out, with expectation of other civil construction projects to be executed. The northern part of the city is the one that has contributed the most to small works, due to the large number of houses built recently."

Like similar names (e.g., \u010ce\u0161njice, \u010ce\u0161njevek, \u010cre\u0161njevci, etc.), the name is derived from the common noun \u010de\u0161nja 'wild cherry', referring to the local vegetation.

It lies by the source of the River Tame, high amongst the Pennines above the village of Delph,  northeast of Oldham, north-northwest of Uppermill and Shaw and Crompton. It has a population of around 500. Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Denshaw and its surroundings have provided archaeological evidence of Stone and Bronze Age activity in the area. The name Denshaw is of Old Norse derivation, and the oldest part of the village is an ancient hamlet. Built up around the junction of five major roads, until the 20th century, Denshaw consisted mainly of smallholdings and a few public houses such as the Junction Inn, originally built as a coaching house for travellers. Denshaw is noted for its annual Whit Friday brass band contest."

        "content": "There is evidence of Stone Age activity around Denshaw; in 2004 Saddleworth Archaeological Trust objected to the construction of a wind farm on a site on Denshaw Moor which had produced more than 200 Mesolithic artefacts. Human activity in Denshaw continued in the Bronze Age, as demonstrated by the discovery of a palstave on Wall Green in 1932, when a trench was being dug for a water pipe, and some tools from Denshaw Moor, on the site of the proposed wind farm, which include a ceremonial flint dagger. A Roman road may also cross the site. The name Denshaw is derived from Old Norse, suggesting a settlement may have existed there during the period of the Danelaw. Denshaw Fold, the oldest part of the village, is an isolated hamlet of ancient origin. Many of the traditional stone dwellings are listed buildings and are descendants of the cluster of houses first built in the locality during the 16th century. Around 1795, the Junction Inn at Denshaw was erected. It served as a posting house on the Ripponden-to-Oldham turnpike road (opened in 1798) for the changing of horses and the provision of refreshments. Denshaw did not experience the same rate of urbanisation and industrialisation as its surrounding settlements during the Industrial Revolution, and it did not become a mill town or a centre of the local cotton mill boom as did nearby Rochdale, Milnrow and Oldham. However, Denshaw Vale was a calico printing factory which was \"an important concern that employed a workforce of 150\" during the 19th century. Furthermore, Denshaw was chosen as the site of a reservoir which local mills were to contribute monies and thereby use; In 1828, Rackenden Deign Reservoir was built by Denshaw to provide for 24 watermills. In 1818 an Oddfellows Lodge was erected in the village. In 1887, Denshaw was documented having a population of 1,279. In 2003, energy company E.ON UK proposed the installation of seven  wind turbines at Denshaw. This was met with opposition from the local and wider communities, culminating in the Saddleworth Moors Action Group, who were joined by environmentalist David Bellamy. The council received over 1,000\u00a0letters objecting to the proposed wind farm, and although initially accepted by the former Liberal Democrat local authority, the application was rejected by Labour-controlled Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council on 1 March 2006. On 23 May 2007, Denshaw's post office (which doubled-up as the village's only shop) was the centre of a robbery. The \"tiny premises\" had been under threat of closure owing to Post Office's modernisation plans and has since closed. On 17 April 2008, local, national and international media reported on Denshaw's entry on Wikipedia which had been vandalised with spoof information, although the offending material was removed after initial reports were published. The story featured on the BBC's North West Tonight, a regional news programme, and later picked up by news services as far away as Pakistan."

Like the other Yorkshire areas of the ancient parish, it was in the wapentake of Agbrigg in Yorkshire, with the Lancashire areas of the ancient parish being in Salfordshire. The Byrons (including Romantic poet George Gordon Byron) were prominent land owners in Denshaw. Denshaw was created an ecclesiastical parish in 1864, out of the former Friarmere parochial chapelry. It was in the deanery of Ashton-under-Lyne from 1864 to 1872. It then became part of Rochdale deanery until 1881 when it again became part of Ashton-under-Lyne. In 1929, it transferred to Oldham deanery. It is currently in Saddleworth Deanery, part of the Archdeanery of Rochdale, in the Anglican Diocese of Manchester. From 1894 to 1900, Denshaw lay within Saddleworth Rural District, a local government district in the administrative County of York, West Riding. In 1900, Denshaw was merged into Saddleworth Urban District, where it stayed until 1974. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Saddleworth Urban District was abolished, and Denshaw has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, within Greater Manchester. Denshaw lies within the Saddleworth North electoral ward. Since 1997, Denshaw has formed part of the parliamentary constituency of Oldham East and Saddleworth, and is represented in the House of Commons by Debbie Abrahams, a member of the Labour Party. Between 1983 and 1997 it was in the Littleborough and Saddleworth constituency."

The US Congress passed the 1984 California Wilderness Act that set aside the Mount Shasta Wilderness. The US Forest Service is the managing agency  as the wilderness  is within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The area is named for and is dominated by the Mount Shasta volcano which reaches a traditionally quoted height of  above sea level, but official sources give values ranging from  from one USGS project, to  via the NOAA.  Mount Shasta is one of only two peaks in the state over  outside the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. The other summit is White Mountain Peak in the Great Basin of east-central California. The Wintun Glacier is located on Mount Shasta and is the lowest-elevation glacier in the state, lying at  elevation and extending to the summit. The  smaller volcanic cone of Shastina (12,270\u00a0ft) lies one mile (1.6\u00a0km) west of Mount Shasta and was formed after the ice-age glaciers melted. The wilderness protects both pristine forests and areas that were intensively logged and roaded in the past. Although less than half of the mountain remains roadless,  Mount Shasta Wilderness is still the premier destination for a variety of activities from mountaineering, day-hiking, and  backpacking to cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and ski mountaineering. It is valued for the many scenic, geologic and recreational attributes including glaciers, lava flows, hot springs, waterfalls and forests of Shasta red fir, sugar pine and other conifers."

Also, falling rocks are a major danger above timberline. The best time of year for hiking Mount Shasta is June and July, when routes are still snow-covered. Although there is no designated trail to the summit, many cross-country routes ascend to the mountaintop and all require experience in traversing ice and snow. There are ten trailheads giving access to the wilderness and several short trails leading up the slopes of Mount Shasta with the so-called  Shasta Summit Trail (or Avalanche Gulch) being the most popular. This trail, although the \"easiest\" of the routes, still requires the use of ice axe and crampons.  There are four major glaciers and three smaller glaciers radiating from the summit in addition to lava flows on the northern flank composed of andesite and basalt. A parking permit is required as well as a free wilderness permit and, if attempting a hike above , a  Summit Pass for each climber must be purchased. Human waste must be packed out, and all principles of Leave No Trace etiquette employed. Some restrictions include no dogs in the wilderness, a limit of 10 people in a group and no wood campfires."

From  to timberline are krummholz forms of whitebark pine. Wildlife include the ubiquitous black bear, coyote, ground squirrel, deer, golden eagles, prairie falcons and red-tail hawks. Common wildflowers are  Shasta lily, miner's lettuce, showy phlox and mountain violet among others. Notable rare plants in the Mount Shasta Wilderness and surrounding area include Mt. Shasta arnica (Arnica viscosa), Siskiyou Indian paintbrush (Castilleja miniata ssp. elata) and Shasta owl's clover (Orthocarpus pachystachyus). The Siskiyou Indian paintbrush is hemiparasitic, meaning  that the plant obtains water and nutrients from the roots of other plants, then manufactures food by photosynthesis. The Shasta owl's clover (Orthocarpus pachystachyus) of the family Scrophulariaceae is critically imperiled and was believed to be extinct. First described in 1848 by  Harvard University botanist Asa Gray, the plant was not collected again until 1913. Known only from  two reports from the Shasta Valley of northern California, it could not be relocated despite repeated searches of the moist meadows and vernal pools where it was thought originally to have been found. In May, 1996,  botanist Dean Taylor of the University of California, Berkeley, rediscovered the evasive plant on the higher, drier ground of a sagebrush-covered hillside. But even in this habitat the wildflower appears to be extraordinarily rare. Taylor was able to find only eight individual plants of the owl\u2019s-clover."

It is a -story gambrel-roofed brick house, laid in English bond. It has a traditional two-room plan with central hall. It still has original paneling in the west room and central hall. There were later twentieth-century additions to the house, of a -story wing and connecting hyphen. The creek side has a long screened porch. The property is also significant for its associations with Richard Bennett, Puritan governor of the Virginia colony from 1652 to 1655, during the reign of Oliver Cromwell. He had a plantation in Isle of Wight County, Virginia, as well as other properties. Also involved in the colony of Maryland, in 1665 Bennett patented 2500 acres on the north side of Wicomico Creek. His grant was large enough to be classified under the Maryland system as a manor. The property was bought in 1721 by George Dashiell (1690\u20131748) from one of Bennett's grandchildren; he patented 1740 acres after a re-survey. A wealthy planter, Dashiell is believed to have built the house that currently stands on the property. He served in the Lower House of the Assembly in 1724, 1745, and 1746. He attained the rank of Colonel in the Maryland militia by 1736. His family retained the property until 1791. Bennett's Adventure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975."

There are reports of  Bangladeshi infiltrators entering Murshidabad district. An estimate made in 2000 places the total number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in India at 1.5 crore, with around 3 lakh entering every year. The thumb rule for such illegal immigrants is that for each illegal person caught four get through. While many immigrants have settled in the border areas, some have moved on, even to far way places such as Mumbai and Delhi. The border is guarded by the Border Security Force. During the UPA government, Sriprakash Jaiswal, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, had made a statement in Parliament on 14 July 2004, that there were 12 million illegal Bangladeshi infiltrators living in India, and West Bengal topped the list with 5.7 million Bangladeshis. More recently, Kiren Rijiju, Minister of State for Home Affairs in the NDA government has put the figure at around 20 million. Critics point out that the Bengali politicians, particularly those from the ruling Trinamool Congress and the CPI (M), believe that a soft approach to the problem help them to win Muslim votes."

It provided accommodations for staff employees.  In the early 1970s, the townsite became abandoned as all the houses were relocated to empty lots in Elliot Lake or transported to other communities along the North Shore of highway 17. Although the mine closed in the mid 1960s' many of the buildings including the mill, 2 head-frames and some offices remained in place well into the 1990s.  Several of the offices were used by the Equestrian Club in the 1970s and 1980s. The abandoned mill, during the 1970s and 1980s, became a periodic adventure destination for youngsters from the town of Elliot Lake.

In 1754, the estate was given the status of a fief. The house and estate fell into ruins during the 19th century.  It was purchased in 1977 by Jean-Louis Chancel. Between 1979 and 1999, he planted 186 hectares of vines. He also commissioned the architect Jean-Jacques Pichoux to build a modern winery building, inspired by the architectural style of the Dominican Order. In 1978, C\u00e9cile Chancel decided to build a garden in the style of a 17th-century kitchen garden. She had terraces dug on the hillside next to the vineyards, researched different garden styles, and, with the assistance of landscape gardener Tobie Loup de Vian, began building. The garden reached its present form by 1990. It was classified as a Remarkable Garden of France in 2005."

        "content": "Hafez was born in Shiraz in 1315 and died there in 1390.  A beloved figure of the Iranian people, who learn his verses by heart, Hafez was prominent in his home town and held a position as the court poet.  In his memory, a small, dome-like structure was erected in Shiraz near his grave at Golgast-e Mosalla in 1452 at the order of Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza, a Timurid governor.  The Golgast-e Mosalla were gardens (now known as Musalla Gardens) that featured in Hafiz's poetry.  With a surface of over 19,000 square metres, the gardens were also home to one of Shiraz's cemeteries, and Babur had a pool built here at the same time as the memorial.  Believing they were ordered by omens in Hafez's poetry, Abbas I of Persia and Nader Shah both carried out separate restoration projects in the following 300 years. A much more substantial memorial was constructed in the gardens in 1773 during the reign of Karim Khan Zand.  Situated on the north bank of the seasonal Rudkhaneye Khoshk river in the Musalla Gardens, the H\u0101fezieh consisted of four central columns, with two rooms built at the east and west end and with the north and south sides remaining open.  The building split the gardens into two regions, with the orange grove in the front and the cemetery in the back.  The actual tomb was outside of the structure, in the middle of the cemetery, with a marble slab placed over the grave.  The marble was engraved by a calligrapher with excerpts from Hafez's poetry. The tomb was restored in 1857 by a governor of Fars, and a wooden enclosure was built around the tomb in 1878, by another governor of Fars.  Following this, the site became a subject of controversy, when, in 1899, Ardeshir, a Parsi from India began to build a shrine around Hafez's grave.  Although the philanthropist Parsi had obtained permission from an ulema of Shiraz to build the iron and wood shrine, a doctor of religious law with some authority in Shiraz, \u02bfAli-Akbar F\u0101l-Asiri, objected to a Zoroastrian building over the grave of a Muslim.  With his followers, he destroyed the half-built construction.  The people of Shiraz protested the destruction and the government ordered the rebuilding of the monument, but F\u0101l-Asiri opposed them and pronounced that he would destroy any building raised there, even if it were erected by the king himself. The site remained in ruins for two years, until 1901 when Prince Malek Mansur Mirza Shao es-Saltaneh placed a decorative iron transenna around Hafez's tomb.  It was inscribed with verse and the names of the patrons of the transenna."

Additional improvements were delayed until the Ministry of Education organised for a new building to be built, in 1935.  Andr\u00e9 Godard, a French archaeologist and architect, was the technical director of the Department of Antiquities at the time, and was commissioned to design the new buildings. Other sources however attribute the design to Maxime Siroux. Alterations to Hafez's tomb involved elevating it one metre above ground level and encircling it with five steps.  Eight columns, each ten metres tall, support a copper dome in the shape of a dervish's hat.  The underside of the dome is an arabesque and colourful mosaic. The original, four-columned memorial hall built in 1773 by Karim Khan Zand was extensively expanded.  Sixteen pillars were added to the four original, creating a long verandah, and on several fa\u00e7ades are engraved ghazals and other excerpts from Hafez's poetry."

        "content": "The Yates field is the southernmost of the large oil fields on the eastern rim of the Central Basin Platform in the Texas Permian Basin, the most productive petroleum-producing region in the continental United States.  The Permian Basin is a geologic region, about  long and  across, which was downwarped during the Permian period.  During this time it filled with water and became a sea, while the subsidence continued.  Over tens of millions of years the sea filled with sediments \u2013 principally limestones and dolomites in the area of the Yates Field \u2013 and then as the sea evaporated, those sedimentary rocks were capped with a large layer of evaporites, such as potash and sea salt.  These stratigraphic sequences are among the thickest collections of Permian rocks in the world.  In areas where large anticlines formed, oil from deeper-lying source rocks was trapped in permeable rocks such as the limestone and dolomite underneath the impermeable cap of evaporite sediments. In the Yates Field, the two richest oil-bearing rocks are the Grayburg Dolomite and San Andres Formation.  The Grayburg is cavernous, having once been a tropical island with fresh water carving holes in the limestone, creating a karst terrain; the San Andres consists of fractured, dolomitized carbonates, and like the Grayburg contains copious free space in which petroleum accumulated over the eons.  Some of these oil-filled caverns are as high as .  In addition to these two units, the Queen Formation, which contains interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and dolomite, and the complex Seven Rivers Formation, contain recoverable quantities of oil.  Capping all four units is a salt layer in the Seven Rivers Formation."

        "content": "The land which the field underlies was owned by Ira and Ann Yates, ranchers in the hardscrabble Trans-Pecos region of West Texas (the town of Iraan is named for them: Ira+Ann).  Yates had recently purchased the ranch, and was having difficulty making sufficient profit to pay the mortgage and taxes; on a hunch, he invited Michael Late Benedum's Transcontinental Oil Company to explore his land for oil.  In 1926, a partnership consisting of Mid Kansas Oil Company (part of The Ohio Oil Company, the ancestor of Marathon Oil) and Transcontinental Oil, drilled an exploratory well, the Yates No. 1-A, on the Yates ranch into the San Andres formation approximately  below ground surface, and hit a rich productive zone, producing a \"gusher\" \u2013 an uncontrolled spew of crude oil, under intense pressure, into the air.  Lacking any other means of containment, the crew dammed a nearby draw to build a holding pond for the oil.  Other wells drilled nearby also hit substantial quantities of oil \u2013 it seemed to be everywhere.  Both Yates and the oilmen immediately recognized the significance of their find. Unfortunately for the early development of the field, oil production and transportation infrastructure was lacking nearby.  Early drillers needed huge holding tanks, pipelines, or rail sidings; until these could be built or supplied, no oil could be transported to buyers.  Humble Pipe Line Co., an ancestor of Exxon Company, was the nearest to have any facilities at all \u2013 a pipeline that went to McCamey, in Upton County, about  northwest of the production area.  Humble began construction of a  storage tank to hold the oil, but even that was insufficient for the colossal quantities of crude that flowed from the field. Many of the early wells on the Yates Field were phenomenally productive; the first five wells, by spring 1927, together produced an average of , far more than could be stored or moved.  The sixth well drilled, Yates 6-A, blew out due to extreme gas pressure, and  blew through the damaged well onto the ground, pooling in nearby canyons.  Operators were able to retrieve most of it by damming the canyons and sucking the oil up with pumps. Environmental standards were lax to nonexistent in the early days of the industry, and poorly constructed wells in the field often leaked crude from unsealed portions of the casing.  Much of this oil migrated upwards, contaminating the Pecos River.  Thousands of barrels per day were recovered by skimming the river, as well as drilling shallow wells, above the capping geologic formation, capturing oil before it reached ground surface.  Over  of oil was eventually recovered, all from seepage from poorly cased wells. Production from the field peaked in 1929, with a total production of  of oil.  That year also saw the spudding of well Yates 30-A, which blew out with the spectacular flow of  per hour, and over 200,000 in a day, setting the world record; even the Lakeview Gusher at the Midway-Sunset field in California, which spewed a total of approximately  in its 18-month uncontrolled run, only attained half of that daily flow rate.  Because of the high production rate from the field and lack of storage and transport, the State of Texas Railroad Commission \u2013 the entity that oversees petroleum production \u2013 required a proration of the field for the first time in Texas history.  Under this rule, all operators were given an equal share in the pipeline outlet based on what their wells could produce, based on the total field production.  Additionally, operators were restricted in the depth they could drill into the prolific reservoir, to give each an equal advantage. When the field was discovered, an instant boomtown sprung up in the form of tents and shanties around a red barn on the Yates Ranch, about three miles (5 km) south of present-day Iraan.  This town, unsurprisingly named Redbarn, acquired a post office, general store, hotel, filling station, and restaurant, but never had a permanent population greater than 75.  Ira Yates, owner of the ranch and oil field, donated  of his land for the townsite of Iraan, which town survives to the present day.  Redbarn was abandoned in 1952. The two major early operators of the field, Ohio Oil and Mid-Kansas, merged in 1962 to form Marathon Oil, which ran the field until 2003.  By 1966 production had diminished due to depletion of many of the major reservoirs, and between 1968 and 1972 Marathon operated a waterflooding program on the west side of the field, along with a CO2-injection regime.  Both of these enhanced recovery technologies increased pressure in the field, allowing increased oil recovery, which approximately doubled as a result.  In the late 1970s, production again dropped, and Marathon commenced another waterflood project, this time followed closely by a pattern polymer flood.  The polymer flood was ended in 1989.  The 1 billionth barrel of oil was produced on January 11, 1985. Between 1985 and 1991, Marathon injected more CO2 into the central, eastern, and northern parts of the field; all of these activities improved production. In 1992 there were 1,100 active production wells, along with 57 injection wells.  Careful study of the fractured nature of the oil-bearing geologic units allowed operators to shut down almost 400 of the least efficient wells without diminishing the overall output of the field. The current operator of the field is Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, who acquired it from Marathon Oil in 2003.  Currently there are over 360 productive oil wells."

Up to around 1951, two-fifths of the refugees settled in South Bengal, the balance settled in the North Bengal districts of West Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar. Erstwhile West Dinajpur alone received around 6.5% of the early entrants. The steady flow of people into Dakshin Dinajpur has continued over the years from erstwhile East Pakistan and subsequently from Bangladesh."

It is probable that James Wallis built the centre part of the house, with the pillared portico and bowed wings being added at a later stage.

When he died in Demerara he was the owner of five coffee plantations, worked by some 2000 slaves. Andreas came to England and married the daughter of the rector of Liverpool. On her death he bought Lucknam Park and moved there with his two children Phebe and John. It is at this time that he added the pillared portico and bowed wings to the house. Country land was also added to the estate. His son proved to be a great traveller and after university he set off for Italy, Russia, Palestine, Egypt and Turkey. He married Clemetina in 1834 and a few days after the marriage there were celebrations at Lucknam. Eight hundred people sat down at tables to the side of the house and a cannon signalled the start of the feast (an artist impression of the occasion can be seen in Reception). The newlyweds travelled to Italy spending a year in Florence. They had four daughters, two of whom died in infancy. Unusually for the time Clementina left John and there was a divorce. John remained at Lucknam Park with his daughters. The interior of the house was much altered at this time. The Hall was panelled in dark oak, with carved beams, and coats of arms on the ceiling. There was a large Library which is now the Drawing Room. The present hotel's restaurant was a conservatory. Upstairs the boudoir was a very heavily furnished room, with Jacobean panelling, and stained glass windows. Soon after John's death in 1870 the estate (now 1,100 acres) was sold."

When Eion married in 1932 he and his wife Jean moved from Scotland to Lucknam. They made many alterations to the inside and outside of the house. In 1933 the blacksmith from the nearby village of Crudwell made wrought iron gates for the walled garden that are still at the hotel today. The drawing room was decorated in blue flock paper (silk finished paper overlaid with velvet designs). The family was given a green and white marble fireplace for the drawing room from the father of Davina's aunt, Alice Crichton. He had bought it from the Crichtons home in Dublin in exchange for a bottle of whisky. In the library, the red flock paper was removed and the current panelling was installed by the great decorators of that era, Lenygon. Cars were parked in the courtyard. Around the fountain was a ring of cherry trees. The groom and his wife lived in one of the courtyard buildings and the gardeners in the cottages leading to the Hotel's leisure spa. Race horses and hunters were stabled in the farm buildings and Snowdrop bedroom in the courtyard was a saddle room. Apples were stored in the dovecote. For a short time at the start of the war, the house was home to hundreds of evacuees before being transformed into a bustling informal headquarters for airmen from the neighbouring aerodrome. They used Lucknam Park's beech and lime tree lined driveway to park their Spitfires and Hurricanes \u2013 the huge trees providing camouflage. The main hotel dining room (then used as a billiard room/junk room) had side cupboards filled with tinned food, a billiard table and a large dolls house (now displayed at Longleat House). All its windows were covered with brown paper to block out light and netting to catch splinters of shattered glass. The entire house was heated by just three fires in the hall, library and drawing room. During an air raid, everyone in the house raced to the dining room and hid under the billiard table. Among the many visitors to Lucknam during the war was Queen Mary of England who was staying at nearby Badminton House. When Eion Merry died in 1966 at 63 years, the family could no longer afford the upkeep of the country house. Faced with the option of either demolishing both wings of the historic house to scale down the size they decided to sell to neighbour, Mr. Stevens. In 1987, Lucknam Park was bought by Lucknam Park Hotels Ltd. As of October 2016, the hotel has been under the ownership and control of a private family since 1994."

        "content": "In 796 Charlemagne, by permission of Pope Leo III, founded on ground adjoining this spot a hospice for pilgrims, which was intended for the people of his empire. In connection with the hospice was a church dedicated to the Saviour and a graveyard for the burial of the subjects of Charlemagne who died in Rome. From the beginning, this foundation was placed under the care of the ecclesiastical authorities of St Peter's. The decline, soon after this period, of the Carolingian empire, brought the hospice, the Schola Francorum, entirely under the jurisdiction of the basilica; at the same time, the original intent of a place for pilgrims and the poor was preserved. In the complete ruin which overtook Rome during the Avignon Papacy (1309\u20131378), and during the following decades of the Western Schism, the ecclesiastical foundations in the vicinity of St. Peter's sank into decay. After the return of the popes, new life sprang up, and the enthusiasm for building and endowing foundations in the Borgo was rekindled under Popes Martin V, Eugenius IV, and Nicholas V. The remembrance of Charlemagne and his hospice revived in the mind of the large and influential German colony then residing at Rome, and during the reign of Martin V (1417\u20131431) the enlarged cemetery was surrounded with a wall built by Fredericus Alemannus, who also erected a house for its guardians. During the plague outbreak of 1448, Johannis Assonensis, a German confessor attached to St. Peter's and later Bishop of Wurzburg, assembled his countrymen there  and founded among them a brotherhood, the object of which was to provide suitable burial for all poor Germans dying in Rome. When the Holy Year 1450 brought many pilgrims to Rome, the brotherhood built a church, a new hospice for German pilgrims on the adjoining land, and developed the Campo Santo into a German national institution. In the 15th, 16th, and even in the 19th century the German nation was represented at Rome by numerous officials at the papal court and by guilds of German bakers, shoemakers, and weavers; in these ages Germans were to be found in every industry of ordinary life, and German bankers and inn-keepers were especially numerous. Nevertheless, the steadily decreasing German population of Rome during the 17th and 18th centuries caused the Campo Santo, as a national foundation, and the brotherhood to sink into neglect. The church was progressively eclipsed by the church of Saint Maria dell' Anima. In 1876 Pope Pius IX founded a seminary for German-speaking priests for the special study of archaeology and church history to replace the Schola Francorum. Today, the church is still an important gathering place for the German-speaking community in Rome."

Access to the Church (from the cemetery) is through a portal by sculptor Elmar Hillebrand of Cologne, given in 1957 by the President of the Republic of Germany Theodor Heuss. During the Sack of Rome (1527), the Swiss Guard made their last stand in the Teutonic Cemetery, holding off the invading troops long enough for Pope Clement VII to escape over the Passetto di Borgo to Castel Sant'Angelo. The Chapel of the Swiss served as a burial place for the fallen guards. A guide from the early 19th century mentions a main altarpiece depicting a Deposition by Polidoro di Caravaggio, flanked by painting by Giacinto d'Hasse. This latter painter's tomb monument, located inside the church, was sculpted by Francois Duquesnoy. The lateral altars housed a St Erasmus by Giacinto Gimignani and Epiphany by Scarsellino; the altar dedicated to St Charles Borromeo had an altarpiece depicting the Flight to Egypt by Arrigo Fiammingo; St John Nepomunk by Ignazio Stern; and the sacristy held an Immaculate Conception by Luigi Garzi."

St. Thomas' Church also grew, reaching the point that the old frame church was becoming too small for the number of parishioners.  Accordingly, the cornerstone was laid for a new brick church in 1883.  In this same year, the parish was rededicated for Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland; the cemetery retained its former name. Architectural historians have divided the Precious Blood-related churches of western Ohio into multiple generations.  Only a few buildings remain from the first generation, which consisted primarily of small wooden churches, and only St. John's Church in Fryburg to the east remains essentially unchanged.  Replacing these wooden buildings were the churches of the second generation, which were generally small brick buildings without tall spires.  St. Patrick's occupies of a transitional place between the churches of the second and third generations; although it is a small brick building that replaced an early wooden church, its tower resembles those of the High Gothic Revival churches of the third generation."

        "content": "Apapelgino was used primarily to meet the administrative needs of the Pevek Airport, as well as for housing the airport's workers. In the 1950s, the airfield was developed as a part of the Soviet Air Forces' plan to create a ring of air bases around the Arctic for the use of its strategic bomber fleet during the Cold War. During the Cold War, this airfield formed a network of forward staging bases inside the Arctic Circle, the need for which was dictated by geography and weather. The northern parts of the Soviet Union closest to the United States are in the Arctic, with hostile weather conditions. Consequently, Soviet strategic bombers were normally stationed at bases in more temperate parts of the Soviet Union, flying training missions from these forward staging bases. However, the focus on intercontinental ballistic missiles as opposed to bombers meant that the airfield became less important and this was reflected by a gradual reduction in the local population. Following the 1957 expansion of the airport, construction of a road linking Apapelgino to Pevek began in 1959; in 1961, a bridge was constructed over the Apapelgyn River to complete the link. As Apapelgino grew, a boiler house, greenhouses for growing vegetables, a complex for the lower secondary school, cafeteria and library, a nursery, kindergarten, and a series of apartment buildings were built. By the beginning of the 21st century, however, the reduction in the population was such that it was decided that the remaining residents would be resettled to Pevek, with most residents leaving in 2001. Nevertheless, some refused to be resettled and, for the fear of losing the privileges allotted to the residents of localities in the process of liquidation, continued to reside in Apapelgino even after central heating was turned off. Most of those residents moved out in 2002. Even after Apapelgino was mostly abandoned (with only five people remaining in residence as of 2005), the airport still serves as the main transport hub for Northern Chukotka and the local infrastructure is being maintained."

        "content": "The Battle of Binnion Hill was fought in 1557 just a short distance from Porthall, approx. 2.5 miles (4 kilometres) North West. The battle came about when John O\u2019Neill, the Grandson of Con O\u2019Neill assembled an army to attack Tirconnell, modern day County Donegal. O\u2019Neill's plan was to defeat Manus O'Donnell from the Kinel-Connell and thus be the only King in Ulster. On the O\u2019Neills side were people from Oriel, modern day Counties Armagh, Louth and Monaghan and from Dundalk, County Louth, also part of O\u2019Neill's army was Hugh O\u2019Donnell (brother of Calvagh) and his followers. The Kinel-Connell was in turmoil at this time as Calvagh O'Donnell had his father locked up for two years so that he himself could be ruler of the O\u2019Donnells and O\u2019Donnell lands. Calvagh, unsure of what to do in the event of an attack from the O\u2019Neills consulted with his father who advised not to attack the O\u2019Neills but to wait until they crossed the river and then to attack their camp at Carraig Laith (Carrickalee, Strabane, County Tyrone). Carraig Laith is close to where the two rivers meet to create the River Foyle. O\u2019Neill and his army left their camp in Tyrone, crossing the River Finn and marched towards Raphoe then along the Laggan to a place called Baile-aighidh-chaoin, where they set up a new camp. This is now known as Balleeghan townland, close to the banks of Lough Swilly in Raymoghy Parish. Calvagh was at a meeting on the summit of Bennin (Binnion). Others with Calvagh were his son Con and Walter McSweeney who had brought two companies of gallowglasses of the McSweeneys of Fanad. Also there was Donnell Gorm McSweeney and his followers who were the descendants of Donnell. Two members of Calvagh's party were sent to spy on the O\u2019Neill camp and report back to Calvagh at Binnion. On hearing the testimony of the spying mission Calvagh decide to attack John O\u2019Neill and his forces at his camp immediately. The troops of Calvagh numbering two battalions marched on the O\u2019Neill camp and began killing and slaughtering all before them. John O\u2019Neill on hearing the commotion in his camp realised that he was under attack and fearing for his life slipped out of the back of his tent. Two other people escaped with O\u2019Neill that night, Hugh O\u2019Donnell (son of Manus) and Donough O\u2019Gallagher (son of Felim Finn). The three men in their retreat back into Tyrone had to cross the River Deele, River Finn and the River Derg by swimming across them and as it had been raining heavily that night the rivers were very swollen, making it even more dangerous. On reaching Tearmonn-Ui-Moain, he bought a horse and made his way to Aireagal-da-Chiarog  by morning. Meanwhile, back at the battle site Calvagh and his men were in high spirits and enjoying the spoils of war. In the morning when the booty was being divided up Con (son of Calvagh) got as his portion eighty horses, the prize of all the horses was Shane O'Neill\u2019s (son of John) own horse called \u2018The Son of the Eagle\u2019. It is said that the spoils from the battle were the most from any battle between the O\u2019Neills and O\u2019Donnells."

        "content": "Port Hall, after which the village is named, is located on the west bank of the River Foyle. Built in the mid 18th century in the Georgian style, it was once owned by Tony Marreco. Mr Marreco was Junior Counsel at the Nuremberg Trials just after the Second World War. He later became a founding director of Amnesty International. Port Hall is now a stud farm situated on the northern end of the village. Long Vale House (previously known as Clonfade), parts of which were built in 1611, is one of the oldest houses in County Donegal. It was built by a Thomas Keyes who served under Sir Richard Hansard, and when Hansard was appointed Governor of Lifford, Thomas Keyes received from him a plot of land on which to build a house. This land was Clonfade. Thomas Keyes was High Sheriff of Londonderry City in 1623 and owner of the estate of Clonfade, after which the house is named. It is now known as The Hall Green. The house is located on the outskirts of the village on the R265 road to Lifford. Mongevlin Castle (also known as Mongavlin Castle) is a ruined castle which lies on the west bank of the River Foyle, approx 4\u00a0km north of Porthall. In the sixteenth century Mongevlin was the chief residence of Ineen Dubh, she was the daughter of MacDonnell, Lord of the Isles and mother of Red Hugh O'Donnell. The State Paper recording her possession of the castle: \"From Cul-Mac-Tryan runs a bogg three myles in length to the side of Lough Foyle in the midst of the bog is a standing loughe called Bunaber here at Bunaber dwells O'Donnell's mother (Ineen Dubh M'Donnell). Three miles above Cargan stands a fort called McGevyvelin (Mongivlin) upon the river of Lough Foyle O'Donnell's mother's chief house\". The castle was recorded by Captain Nicholas Pynnar in his Survey of the Escheated Counties of Ulster in 1619 where he wrote that Sir John Stewart had built a very strong castle at \u2018Magerlin\u2019 with a flanker at each corner. There had been a flag stone over the archway with the inscription 'J.S.-E.S.T.-1619' which went missing in the early eighteenth century. Though the account that the castle had been completed in 1619 is contradicted by a later Survey (in 1622) of the Escheated Counties of Ulster that reads; Sir John Stuart, assignee of the Duke of Lennox \u2018has built a castle of lime and stone on the banks of the River Foyle 50\u2019 x 25\u2019 x 3\u00bd stories, slated, with 4 flankers at the top thereof. And an iron door portcullis wise; the principal timber and joists of the floor being oak are laid but not boarded or the partitions made, the iron grates for the windows being within the castle ready to be set up\u2019. There is a wonderful pencil drawing showing the castle at that time available here. King James visited here on his way to the siege of Derry in 1689. From here he sent a letter proposing surrender, it was rejected. The castle later became the property of The Hon. Elizabeth Hamilton whose eldest son, James, Earl of Abercorn, and Viscount Strabane erected a plaque in her memory in 1704. The castle is now in ruins with only a small proportion of it left standing."

The remaining male occupations in Ramsden Crays like gamekeeper, carpenter and blacksmith were occupied by 1\u20132 people maximum, highlighting the dominance of agriculture in the parish. The female occupational structure was dominated by women who did not work or did not have a listed occupation, making up more than half of women. Women were also excluded from many occupations such as agriculture, commercial and vegetable substance services. In contrast, educational and dress making occupations were only occupied by women. The occupational structure between men and women in 2011 compared to that of men and women in 1881 is very different. For men, in 2011, there where a wider range of industries people worked in, increasing from 11 in 1881 to 17 in 2011. Agriculture, which had been the dominant occupation in 1881, employing 33 people employs only 4 in 2011, showing agriculture is no longer the dominant industry in the parish. Construction and the Repair of Motor Vehicles and Motor Cycles are now the most dominant industries, making up just under a half of occupations, showing that for males there is a wider range of employment opportunities. The employment opportunities for females have also increased from 11 in 1881 to 17 in 2011. In 1881, women working in Domestic Offices and Services made up more than half of the female working population, with the number of women without a listed occupation made up a quarter. By 2011, women were working in wide range of occupations, similar to that of the male occupation structure. Education and Human Health and Social Activities are the dominant female occupations, but, together they make up less than a third of the female occupations."

        "content": "The chamber dates to between 2500\u20131500 BC and is one of eight remaining quoits on the West Penwith moors. Archaeological evidence unearthed on the site has indicated that the chamber was used for the burial of bodies which at some point would be cremated and removed and replaced with others. The purpose of the exterior stones are believed to have been for resting the dead bodies against for the flesh to be devoured by birds before burial.  Excavations at the site have revealed flint and Neolithic style pottery and cremated bones. A local legend is associated with the chamber in that it is said  that the quoit possesses mystical powers and that removed stones from the structure would soon mysteriously find their way back in the middle of the night. In 1754 and in 1769, before the roof had fallen, the quoit was analysed by the antiquary Dr. William Borlase (1695\u20131772), who described and provided detailed drawings of it and published some of his findings in his Antiquities of Cornwall (1769). In 1861, a local farmer proposed to convert the monument into a cattle\u2013shed by removing one of the upright pillars and drilling a hole in the sloping capstone. The vandalism soon reached the disapproving ears of the villagers of Zennor and the local vicar, William Borlase (a great grandson of Dr. William Borlase), intervened and successfully offered a financial incentive of five shillings to the farmer to build it elsewhere, although he had already built stone posts on the site to erect it. Traces of drill\u2013holes can still be seen in the stone In 1882, a member of the Borlase family came to the defence of the quoit again when the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society visited the site. The following account was reported: Every year, the Old Cornwall Society meets behind the chamber on Midsummer's Eve and lights a ritual bonfire."

The Quill / Boven National Park comprises two different areas or subsectors. One is the dormant stratovolcano known as the Quill, which is in the southern part of the island. The other area is a group of five hills in the northern part of the island: Bergje, Boven (the highest of the five), Venus, Gilboa Hill and Signal Hill. These five hills are the remnants of another stratovolcano. The Miriam C. Schmidt Botanical Garden was started in 1998. The main emphasis is on species that are or were native to the island and the surrounding islands. There is also an experimental area where researchers are studying methods of controlling the problematic invasive species Antigonon leptopus, the corallita vine."

This border is ancient, largely following the old divide between the western parish of Saint Marylebone and the parish of Saint Pancras to the east and can be traced back as far as 1792. The street was also a boundary between large estates, such as the Bedford Estate and the Berners Estate. Maps show that the southern end of modern Cleveland Street, beyond Riding House Street, was known as Upper Newman Street and then Norfolk Street. The northern section was once known as Upper Cleveland Street and Buckingham Place. It became Cleveland Street for its full length after a renumbering was ordered by the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1867. The name comes from the Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Cleveland whose estate was connected in the 19th century with the Southampton (Wriothesley) property  via Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton. The Southampton property later  became the Bedford Estate. Cleveland Street is renowned for several historical events and buildings, the most notable recent one being  the BT Tower."

The scandal was rumoured to involve Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, an heir to the throne of Great Britain, though this allegation has never been substantiated. A show inspired by the Cleveland Street scandal and titled Cleveland Street The Musical - with book and lyrics by Glenn Chandler - ran in London between April and May 2011. In his book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution, Stephen Knight mentions Cleveland Street in conjunction with two houses in the street. According to Knight's theory, the royal family was connected with the Jack The Ripper murders from 1888, via the same Prince Albert Victor who he claims met his later wife, Catholic prostitute Annie Elizabeth Crook, at the studio of the painter Walter Sickert at  15 Cleveland Street. After their secret wedding, Annie Elizabeth Crook was allegedly settled in a flat at 6 Cleveland Street.  The conspiracy theory behind the murders described in Knight's book has been loosely adapted into From Hell (1999), a graphic novel by Alan Moore from which a movie with the same title was adapted in 2001. Several scenes in the movie take place in Cleveland Street, although they were not shot on location."

The frontage building of the former Cleveland Street workhouse later Middlesex Hospital annexe and outpatient department on the eastern side of the street at 44  c.1776. Over the years from 1778 until 2005 the building operated as a workhouse then a workhouse infirmary and more recently as a hospital.  UCLH NHS Foundation Trust in 2010 proposed the building's demolition in a planning application (and conservation area consent) submitted to Camden London Borough Council to replace it with a large building mixing private accommodation with commercial space. However adjoining Westminster City Council objected on three grounds on 2 December 2010. The Cleveland Street Workhouse is of particular importance in light of the fact that Charles Dickens is known to have lived nearby in what is now 22 Cleveland Street.  Dickens lived there as a young child between 1815\u20131816 and then again as a teenager between 1828 and 1831. His residence in the street has led to the suggestion that the nearby workhouse was probably the inspiration for Oliver Twist. Cleveland Street hosted the Middlesex Hospital, closed in 2005 and since demolished. The hospital occupied an entire block on the western side of the southern section of the street. The future of this site is currently uncertain, despite its sale by nationalised Icelandic Kaupthing Bank to Aviva Investors and Exemplar Properties. Cleveland Street was described as an area of special architectural and historic interest when it was designated a Conservation Area on 20 November 1990. Anomalously on its Camden side Cleveland Street is part of two conservation areas: the Fitzroy Square conservation area, and the Charlotte Street conservation area.

The rock shelter was constructed by tunneling into a naturally eroded cliff face that created a  sub-horizontal ceiling ranging in height from  above floor level, the roof is supported by 36 pillars created by the natural erosion of fissure lines in the bedrock. Investigation has shown that some pre-existing pillars were removed, some were reshaped and some moved to new positions. In some areas ceiling slabs were removed and repainted by the people who used the cave. Tool marks on the ceiling and pillars clearly illustrate that the modifications served dual purposes, to providing a living space and to facilitate the removal of rock which was discarded down a talus slope. The floor is covered with soil, a mix of ash from fires, fine sand, silt, and locally fragmented rock to a depth of approximately  which lies in seven distinct horizontal stratigraphic layers. Completely open to the north and south, construction has left the shelter entirely protected from rainfall. The rock shelter features prehistoric paintings of fish, including the Barramundi, wallabies, crocodiles, people and spiritual figures. Most of the paintings are located on the shelter's ceiling, but many are found on the walls and pillars of the site."

The congregation first met in a Bethaus (oratory) in the Marktstra\u00dfe. It soon became too small for the growing number of Catholics in the town, which prospered as a spa and Residenz of Nassau. The parish received grounds adjacent to the Luisenplatz from the Duke of Nassau, and from 1829 to 1831 Friedrich Ludwig Schrumpf built a rigidly Neoclassical church, in keeping with the buildings around the square. Soon after the building was completed, it collapsed on 11 February 1831. A likely reason is insufficient foundation on ground which had previously been ponds."

His design is reminiscent of Gothic architecture, but also includes elements of Romanesque architecture and naturalistic ornaments to be found later in the Jugendstil. The foundation was laid on the day of the patron saint St. Bonifatius, on 5 June 1845. The interior was consecrated by the Bishop of Limburg Peter Josef Blum on 19 June 1849. A rib vault is supported by 22 columns. The facade was completed in 1856, and the towers in 1866. In World War II the church suffered severe damage. An air raid on 2\u00a0February 1945 destroyed all the windows, the roof, and part of the vault. Repairs made in 1949 replaced the vault with a simple construction. The vault was re-built in a general restoration in 1965, which also took into account the changes of the Second Vatican Council. A new altar by Elmar Hillebrand was added in 1967. The new windows are stained glass in mainly white, red and blue, designed by Johannes Beeck. Sculptor Karl Hoffmann created a crucifixion scene and a sculpture of both St. Francis and Teresa of \u00c1vila."

It was in the hundred of Newton and the tenant-in-chief was William of Mohun. The Church of England parish church of St Paul dates probably from the late 12th or early 13th century, though only the north wall of the nave is original. The first building was likely only about  wide, and in the mid 13th century the chancel and south wall of the nave were rebuilt to a slightly larger floorplan; the nave's north wall should also have been rebuilt at this time, but the work was not completed. New windows were installed in the north wall in the 15th century. The nave's west wall was rebuilt in 1885, extending the building westwards. The parish was the first incumbency of the academic and clergyman Humphrey Gower (1638\u20131711), who later went on to become Master of Jesus College, Cambridge and then St. John's College, Cambridge. Near St. Paul's is the thatched and mullioned manor house, which dates from the 16th century and which Sir Frederick Treves described in 1906 as \"the most picturesque of its kind\". It has an L-shaped plan and has had several changes since first construction, including the addition of a classical porch around 1600. According to Pevsner the building overall has \"an air [...] of simple innocence under its thatched roof\". It is listed by English Heritage as Grade\u00a0II*. The old open fields of the parish were enclosed before 1771. Hammoon House was built in the 1890s for use as a hunting lodge by the 2nd Viscount Portman of nearby Bryanston. It is an early example of the use of shuttered concrete as a building material, though the exterior was finished to give an appearance of stone. It is now a private residence."

Nicknamed the \"Fighting Fourteenth\" and the \"Red-Legged Devils\", the 14th Regiment participated in numerous battles during the American Civil War. Concerns about the readiness of volunteer militia led to the passage of an \"Armory Law\" in 1862, during the Civil War, which called for the construction of armories statewide. However, the effort stagnated after the end of the war. The 14th Regiment moved to the Gothic-style Second Division/North Portland Avenue/State Arsenal in 1877\u20131878, whereupon the facility was renamed to \"State Armory\". The Second Division Armory, now demolished, was located at Auburn Place and North Portland Avenue in what is now Fort Greene. In 1890\u20131891, the 14th Regiment Armory Commission made plans for a new armory building in the present-day neighborhood of Park Slope, along Eighth Avenue between 14th and 15th Streets, near Prospect Park. The lot measured  on Eighth Avenue and  on the side streets. At the time, the site contained a few industrial buildings. On November 25, 1890, the commission decided to buy the site. The purchase was concluded on March 11, 1891, with the Kings County government paying the Nassau Land and Improvement Company a little over $79,000. William A. Mundell was the building's architect."

The commission asked for another $100,000 appropriation in early 1892. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle called the drastic cost increases as \"a scandal of no common dimensions\", and The New York Times described the armory as one of three Brooklyn armories facing extreme cost overruns, the others being the 13th Regiment Armory in Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant and the 23rd Regiment Armory in Crown Heights. When the Commission asked for a third appropriation of $200,000 in 1893, members of the public filed lawsuits, alleging that individual counties might not have the authority to issue bonds to finance the armories' construction. Construction was delayed for a year and the total cost ended up being $650,000, over twice the original allocation. The cornerstone of the building was laid on December 6, 1894, when the building was nearly complete. The building was substantially complete on August 15, 1895. Twelve days later, the Fourteenth Regiment moved into the new armory building. In 1900, Horgan & Slattery added a new floor and added mezzanine pilings at a cost of $30,000. Six years later, further improvements to the interior were performed for $35,600. The doughboy memorial in front of the Eighth Avenue facade was installed in 1921-1922.

The shelter, one of twenty planned by mayor Ed Koch to provide facilities for 7,000 homeless people, was controversial among residents of Park Slope, who feared that the opening of the shelter would result in an increase in crime. However, by the end of the year, the Times reported no significant increases in crime around the shelter, and that there had been no incidents involving homeless women and the schoolchildren at nearby  107. The armory continued to operate until the state's Division of Military and Naval Affairs took out most of the military presence in 1992. In 1993, the state announced that the National Guard unit at the 14th Regiment Armory would be relocated, but governor George Pataki allocated funds to keep the 8th Regiment and 14th Regiment Armories open. It was officially given to the city in April 1996. The following year, a lawyer who lived in the neighborhood started an unsuccessful campaign to close the shelter.

The front facade, along Eighth Avenue, is flanked by a pair of towers 3 and 4 stories tall. Upon the 13th, 14th, and 23rd Regiment Armories' completions in the mid-1890s, the New-York Tribune stated that \"these three armories are the product of a lavish expenditure ... for the support and encouragement of the militia that has perhaps never been excelled.\" The lot measures  on Eighth Avenue and  along 14th and 15th Streets. The building is set back slightly on its main (eastern) side, along Eighth Avenue. The intervening space is filled by a lawn, surrounded with a wrought iron fence. Both sections of the armory take up the entire 200-foot width between 14th and 15th Streets: the administration building takes up  on the eastern portion of the site, while the drill room took up the area  on the western part of the site."

On the facade, there are clusters of windows spaced at regular intervals, with between one and three round-arched windowpanes in each window cluster. Many of these window openings contain metal grilles above them. There is a rectangular, slightly protruding pavilion in the center of the administration building's Eighth Avenue facade, flanked by a pair of side pavilions containing five bays each. The first story of the central pavilion is faced with bluestone, and contains a large round-arched sally port on the first floor. A short flight of steps underneath the sally port lead to three recessed wooden doors at the entrance. The second floor, above the sally port, contains a slightly recessed balcony. Two asymmetrical towers, both containing a brick cornice with machicolation, are located beside the central pavilion. A four-story tower is located on the left (south) side of the central pavilion, and contains a bartizan or small turret projecting from the corner, while a three-story tower is located on the right (north) side of the central pavilion. The towers' first floors are also faced with bluestone. The 14th and 15th Street facades of the administration building include corner bastions; short projecting towers that roughly bisect this portion of the facade; and chimneys at either western corner. Each side contains nine architectural bays, and each bay contains one window on the second floor and two windows on the first floor. Counting from east to west, the short towers are located between the fifth and sixth bays on each side. These towers, as well as the corner bastions, contain one window on the second floor and three windows on the first floor. The facades of the drill shed that face 14th and 15th Streets contain shallow buttresses, with three round arches in each buttress. On each floor, there are windows only in the buttresses' central arches. Projecting sally port entrances are located on the eastern portions of the drill shed facades and contain rough-faced stone. The drill shed's western facade consists of two sections: a windowless wall on the first floor, and a slightly set-back vaulted upper portion. There are seven architectural bays on the top section, with the three central bays each containing a large arched window."

The second floor contained rooms for the quartermaster, board of officers, and veterans; a gymnasium; various rooms for both non-commissioned and commissioned officers, including an officers' lounge; a surgeon room; officers' and ladies' restrooms; and a lecture & examination room. The third floor tower included a dining room and the superintendent's three-room residence.   The drill room contains a gymnasium with a floor area of , which contains several bricked-up apertures from the second floor. A second set of restrooms, as well as a cue sports room and a bowling alley, were located in the basement under the drill shed. The basement also included an extensive multi-level shooting range, housed in one of the barrel-vaulted spaces. A tunnel led from the basement one block east to Prospect Park, but may have been cut off by the construction of the New York City Subway's Culver Line (carrying the ), which runs under the western border of Prospect Park. According to the National Register of Historic Places nomination for the Armory, the administration building's distinctive architectural features included an \"imposing entrance hall and main corridors with wood floors, wainscotted and plaster walls, beamed ceilings sheathed with pressed metal, and chestnut display cases.\" Some of the display cases still survive in the drill room. Other architectural features included Corinthian columns supporting the interior; wooden doors and ornamentation; and a Louis Comfort Tiffany stained-glass window in the main staircase, which was relocated to Staten Island in the late 1990s. Besides housing the 14th Regiment, the Armory had previously been used for training the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1955-1956 when their regular practice grounds were too wet for training. The space was also used to store balloons for at least one Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and was used as a filming location for Goodfellas (1990), Donnie Brasco (1997), and Meet Joe Black (1998). Today, a veterans' museum is located within the armory, as well as the Prospect Park YMCA's sports facility. A large part of the armory is also used for a women's homeless shelter, which is operated by CAMBA, a non-profit organization based in Flatbush."

        "content": "Supposedly, the castle was built by the brothers Adolf and Everhard von Berg around the year 1108 after Henry V granted them land in Sauerland for their loyal services. On Wulfseck Mountain they built their castle, which they named Wulfeshagen, later Altena. This is one of the several legends of the establishment of the county of Altena and the building of the castle. After the acquisition of the parish land of Mark near the city of Hamm in 1198, the counts of Altena took Mark Castle as their primary residence and called themselves the Counts of the Mark. They continued to only occasionally inhabit Altena Castle and from 1392 onward it was only used as a residence for the county bailiff (Amtmann). Count Engelbert III of the Mark gave the small settlement at the base of the mountain the rights of liberty (such as self-governance). In 1455 the castle burned down and was only re-erected partially. In Brandenburg-Prussian times the castle became a garrison and was sold to the town of Altena in 1771. In the following years an almshouse and a workhouse was established there. This existed until 1840. From 1766 to 1811 there existed a criminal court and prison in the castle. By 1834 the castle was greatly deteriorated and was to be reconstructed. Due to lack of funds, however, this was not carried out. The Johanniter Orde set up a hospital in the buildings. Due to the 300th anniversary of the membership of the County of Mark to Brandenburg-Prussia in 1909 plans for a reconstruction of the castle began. In 1914 this was completed, apart from the outer bailey and lower gatehouse. There was a controversial debate about the modes of reconstruction, where the preference of historic designs over the medieval and early modern architecture was criticised. In 1918 the last works were completed. In 1914, Richard Schirrmann established the world's first youth hostel within the castle, which is still in use today (Jugendherberge Burg Altena). The original rooms are a museum today. The youth hostel continues to run at a location on the lower castle court yard, opened in 1934. Today the castle is symbol  of the town of Altena and a tourist attraction. The entry ticket is also valid for the nearby Deutsche Drahtmuseum (German Wire Museum). During the first weekend of August a yearly Medieval Festival takes place in the castle and town. Part of the castle is used as a restaurant."

While the house was abandoned for years thereafter, there was some interest in demolishing it and converting the land into a shopping center, though this fell through due to zoning issues.  In the meantime, the house was ransacked for what was left behind, including its furnishings, wooden banisters and even the toilets, becoming a victim of vandalism and negligence. The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 17, 1980, but was left derelict for many years, before being purchased by Sharyn and George Luedke in an auction in 1994. They had intended to convert it into a hotel, but contrary to earlier assurances at auction, they were unable to secure restoration grant money from any federal, state, or local agencies. Despite this, the Luedkes have overseen a restoration process, funded through donations and tours. In 2017, the Alton Historical Commission presented them with an award in preservation for work done on the front porch and conservatory."

        "content": "Life School was founded by Dr. Tom Wilson in 1989. Prior to that time, Wilson was employed in the educational system since 1966, serving as a pastor, speaker, and director of private schools. Wilson began Life School in Dallas as a conduit to train adults who were unemployed and had no employable skills, while at the same time offering activities for youth and children.  Wilson reorganized the school's objective after finding a low success rate regarding people whose lifestyles changed permanently. During the 1990s, Wilson worked to make Life School a free tuition school. This was in response to the gang activities in the Dallas area that made the city the murder capital (per capita) of the United States. Wilson's goal was to teach and train children before they became involved in gang activities. Life School filed a charter school application with the Texas Education Agency in 1997. The application was completed by Wilson along with other community leaders that included educational lawyers and other educators. In March 1998 the school was granted the charter and began open enrollment as a free tuition public school in August that same year. The school became popular in the communities it served and parents camped out overnight to enroll their children. The first Life School campus to open was in Oak Cliff, Texas in Dallas County. Life School became the first charter school in Texas to access Permanent School Funding. This took place in 2014 after the Texas State Board of Education expanded such funding to include charter schools. It eliminated its high rate of financing with the Permanent Education Fund now guaranteeing its bonds. Life School sold approximately $100 million in tax-exempt and taxable bonds to refund debt and build a new high school, which it broke ground for in 2014. Located in Waxahachie, Texas, the school is 125,000 square feet and has educational facilities that include science labs, computer labs, athletic practice fields and extracurricular activities. The high school campus is also Life School's seventh campus, with the school saving approximately $13 million through its first bond sale guaranteed by the Permanent School Fund."

There was half a hide of land and land for four ploughs. There were three and a half ploughs, two villeins and six smallholders. The value of the manor was 15 shillings. In 1193 the manor was described as \u2033this desirable manor...\u2033 and the property of Walter Reynell who was castellan of Launceston Castle. Trebarth passed from the Reynells to the Carews and then to the Spoures. Henrie Spoure (died 1603) was one of the owners and in circa 1700 when Edmond Spoure (married to Mary n\u00e9e Rodd) died, the estate passed to his daughter Mary. She married Renatus Bellott of Bochym and they had one son, who died at the age of 8 in 1712. Mary outlived her husband and married Charles Grylls of Court and, was widowed a second time. Mary than met Captain Francis Rodd (1683 \u2013 August 1736), her cousin. In a relationship (but not married, despite rumours) the childless Mary died, leaving Trebartha to her cousin, who was the first Rodd to own Trebartha. In 1730 Francis Rodd married Allice, daughter of William Sandford of Exeter. Edward Rodd (1768 \u2013 1842) succeeded to Trebartha Hall in 1836 and in 1870 the house was in the residence of Francis Rodd (his son). It was demolished in 1949. In summary, Trebartha was in the possession of the Trebartha family from the 12th to the 15th-century; from the late 15th-century to 1730 it was held by the Spoure family and from 1730 to 1940 by the Rodd family. The bird collection of Edward Hearle Rodd which contained at least forty-five cases with 270 specimens, mostly from Cornwall, passed to his nephew Francis R Rodd and all were lost when Trebartha was destroyed by fire in 1949. Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded a Cornish cross in the grounds of Trebartha Hall; it had been found built into the gable of a nearby cottage."

After some years in the brewery business at several locales in North Hudson, he established the William Peter Brewing Company in 1862 at Hudson Avenue and Weehawken Street in what was then Union Hill. Parts of the imposing structure remained, and were repurposed as a storage facility. While he and his family lived for a time across the street at the since demolished Fausel Mansion, Peter eventually built a mansion across the valley on the  cliff where the library now stands. Completed in 1904 at the cost of $75,000, the home was designed like a German-style castle with 17 rooms and  elaborately decorated with ornate woodwork, marble, stained glass, and several fireplaces. A successful businessman, Peter was also a painter encouraged by Hudson River School artist Max Eaglau and maintained a studio as his home for himself and others use, The gallery in the house included many works inspired by his native Black Forest and the Catskill Mountains, where he summered. After Peter's death, the house changed hands and was owned for a time by the Arnoldi family. In the 1930s, to make way for the construction of the Midtown-Hudson Tunnel (today's Lincoln Tunnel), the building and others in the neighborhood and along Boulevard East were acquired by the Port Authority. Many were demolished, but the Peter Mansion was spared and later given to the township. The library opened in 1942 with books and memorabilia donated by local residents. In 1997\u20131998, it closed  for enlargement and renovation and re-opened in 1999."

        "content": "After the sixteenth century, Monmouth was a centre for recusancy.  The town had, in 1773, one of the highest proportions of Catholics in England and Wales. The Penal Laws against Catholics were relaxed in 1778, through the Papists Act, and Monmouth magistrates were petitioned to erect a \"Public Catholick Chapel in the Town\". One of the petitioners, Michael Watkins, was then the landlord of the Robin Hood Inn in Monnow Street, where Mass had been celebrated hitherto in an upper room.  Lobbying resulted in permission being given for this church three years before a similar church in Chepstow.  However, because of a local by-law aimed at making Nonconformist and Catholic buildings as inconspicuous as possible, it had to concede that the building should not look like a church.  The entrance was not allowed to open on to the highway and Catholic worshippers were required to arrive at the chapel one at a time.  The church was originally set back discreetly from the road, concealed by a row of cottages.  The cottages were demolished in Bucknall's rebuilding, after discrimination against Catholics had been eased. The original building forms the area of the present sanctuary and sacristy, and the stained glass window to the left of the sanctuary is Georgian Gothic in style.  The earliest part of the church is the east end, of 1793.  In 1829 came Catholic Emancipation, and the chapel was extended in 1837 with the completion of the chancel, half the length of the present nave. This was followed in 1871 by an extensive rebuilding by Benjamin Bucknall.  This included the demolition of the cottages fronting the church and the erection of the tower and an elaborate frontage in Old Red Sandstone.  Newman describes the \"double bellcote crowned by a precipitously steep slate roof.\"  Internally, the font depicts the serpent of Eden entwined around the stem. From 1835 to 1851 the Roman Catholic priest in Monmouth was Thomas Burgess who went on to be the Bishop of Clifton."

        "content": "The church includes many features, but of especial note is its association with Saint John Kemble, who was a missionary in Monmouthshire and Herefordshire.  He was martyred for his faith at Hereford on 22 August 1679 and lies buried at nearby Welsh Newton.  The Marches were an area where the old faith continued long after the Reformation, and many of the local big houses gave sanctuary to Catholic services conducted clandestinely by priests who could suffer extreme penalties if they were discovered.  The parish of St Mary's organises a pilgrimage to St John Kemble's tomb on the Sunday nearest to the date of his martyrdom.  The church also includes an altar dedicated to the saint's memory, which was used for the celebration of Mass during penal times at Pembridge Castle: this consists of two benches that could be separated to disguise its purpose. These historic buildings were refurbished in 2009/2010. The church possesses a fourteenth-century processional cross; an embroidered red chasuble dating from about 1502; and a hinged cross, possibly of Spanish origin, dating from the seventeenth century."

The administrative region coincides territorially with modern-day census division Region 1; the census division included all of the modern-day Region 1 as well as a part of Region 2. For example, the border of the former Inuvik and Fort Smith census divisions ran through the middle of Great Bear Lake, but the lake is entirely outside of the Inuvik administrative region. The communities of Norman Wells, Colville Lake and Fort Good Hope were part of the census division, but not the administrative region. It comprised the northern and western part of the Northwest Territories, with its main economic centre in the town of Inuvik. The 2006 census reported a population of 9,192 and a land area of .

In 1138, the L\u00fctzel Abbey sent settlers to Frienisberg to found a new abbey.  The new abbey remained small and struggled until the first half of the 13th century, when a number of donations allowed it to expand.  In 1233 it owned land in Frienisberg, Allenwil, Ried, Tedlingen, Niederwiler, Werd, G\u00e4serz bei Ins and Montils bei Nugerol.  At its peak, about 300 farmers worked 5,000 Juchart (a measurement of acreage related to the Roman Jugerum, 1 Juchart was  for a total of ) in 45 villages west of Bern.  It also owned vineyards on the shores of Lake Biel and had 282 men working on the vines.  Finally it controlled the patronage and the right to appoint parish priests in Rapperswil, Seedorf, Nieder-Lyss, Bargen, Sch\u00fcpfen and Grossaffoltern. Initially, the majority of the Abbey's income came from rents or produce from its farms and estates.  Starting in the middle of the 13th century the economy of the monastery began to slowly change.  It moved away from land rents and now began to survive on tithes and offerings.  In the second half of the 13th century, the abbey founded the nunneries of Fraubrunnen, Steinen and Tedlingen. In 1386, the Abbey tied itself closely to Bern, when it accepted Bernese citizenship for its monks and farmers.  This close connection with Bern led to the Abbey's downfall.  When Bern embraced the Protestant Reformation, many Bernese monasteries, including Frienisberg, were secularized.  The last abbot, Urs Hirsinger, fled to Hauterive in the Canton of Fribourg rather than remain in Bern.  In 1534, the abbey church was demolished.  The former convent building was converted into a hospital in 1533 and it housed the local Bernese bailiff until 1798.  In 1834 it was converted into a home for the deaf-mute.  In 1889 it was converted into a nursing home, a role that it still fills today."

        "content": "The abbey grew into a major centre of learning, commerce and agriculture. Among the monks from the abbey was St. Virgilius (Feargal or Farrell), a noted geometer and astronomer who was abbot before he left Ireland and built the cathedral at Salzburg in Austria in the 8th century.  He was canonized in 1233. The Annals of Inisfallen note that \"Repose of Scandl\u00e1n grandson of Tadc, abbot of Achad B\u00f3\" happened in the year 782. A daughter house of Aghaboe was later built at Kilkenny, the capital of Osraige. The Synod of Rathbreasail in 1111, which first divided Ireland into territorial dioceses, included both Aghaboe and Kilkenny in the Diocese of Ossory, with the episcopal see at Kilkenny, whose abbey church became St Canice's Cathedral. The erroneous belief that the see was originally at Aghaboe and later transferred to Kilkenny is traced by John Bradley to a 16th-century misinterpretation of a 13th-century property transfer. The original Aghaboe monastery burned in 1234, and was rebuilt as an Augustinian priory. In 1346 \"The one eyed Diarmaid Mac Giollaph\u00e1draig ... aided by the U\u00ed C\u00e9arbhail ... burned the town of Aghaboe and the cemetery and church and cruelly forsaking St. Canice, abbot, patron of the neighbourhood and found of the place, he, like a degenerate son to his father, burnt and completely destroyed with the crullest fire, the saint's shrine with his bones and relics.\".  This event was very likely accidental; Aghaboe Abbey had been long under the protection of the Mac Giollaph\u00e1draigs of Upper Ossory and its burning occurred during a Mac Giollaph\u00e1draig attack on the Norman fortifications which had been built next to the abbey, and which can still be seen today.  The ruins on the site belong to a Dominican friary founded in 1382 by Finghan MacGillapatrick, Lord of Upper Ossory. The church, which was conserved by the local community, contains a beautifully carved three-light window in the east wall. The abbey was suppressed in 1540.  In 1984, Dr. Jakob Mayr archbishop of Salzburg visited the abbey, in honour of St. Vergilius.  In 1994, Irish President Mary McAleese visited the abbey, and in 2001 the Austrian ambassador, Dr. Paul Leifer also visited.  It has also been a place of recurrent heritage pilgrimage by the members of the Fitzpatrick-Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig Clan Society. The civil parish of Aghaboe and the Roman Catholic parish of Aghaboe, which differ greatly from each other in extent, are both named after the abbey."

        "content": "At the start of World War I Fairbanks-Morse was Beloit's largest employer, producing engines. In 1914 the company began to produce a marine diesel engine, requiring more workers. To meet labor needs, F-M brought in black factory workers, many from the Jim Crow South. Six families came in 1915 - 250 by 1917. Many of the arrivals were unskilled laborers, but there were also blacksmiths, molders, oilers, and a foreman. The influx of new workers produced a housing shortage and Fairbanks-Morse worked to solve the problem. Its subsidiary Eclipse Home Makers, Inc. bought the land that Fairbanks Flats now occupies on the west side of the Rock River across from the factory and planned the rather plain flats there, aiming to contain \"the large number of negroes in one place\" on what was then the edge of town. Meanwhile, the company was planning a separate development for its white employees with single-family homes and curved streets - Eclipse Park - designed by New York architect George B. Post. Segregation wasn't a huge concern then, but the purchase of land for Fairbanks Flats was, because F-M snapped it up just before the city planned to acquire it to be part of a city park/boulevard system. Many felt the tract of land was key to the park system, and the city threatened to condemn the land to stop the land deal. The mayor of Beloit warned that the project could create \"class bitterness that will be enduring and most undesirable for years to come.\" Nevertheless, F-M went ahead with its project. Construction began in late 1917.  Four apartment blocks were built - each with six 2-story apartments. Each building has walls of concrete block, shed roofs, and parapets topping the side walls. The double doors in the front middle of each building is sheltered by a canopy. A simple band of protruding block connects the tops of the windows on each story, but otherwise the buildings are not decorated. In following years, Fairbanks-Morse brought in J.D. Stevenson from Tuskegee Institute to start a YMCA for black youths nearby. The apartments came to be called the Edgewater Flats, but were still administered by F-M officials as late as 1929. Ownership changed after WWII, and people outside of Fairbanks-Morse could rent there. Nevertheless, the Flats remained predominantly black. The NRHP nomination considers the Flats significant as \"an example of the role of private corporations in community planning during an era of rapid industrialization\" and as \"the nucleus of Beloit's twentieth century black community.\""

In front of the island, the Miguick River (Quebec) mouth is very quiet and winding; it was particularly favorable for hunting moose and beavers. This legendary island of Batiscanie, also served as a landmark on expeditions on the river. Among the early explorers French Canadian to visit the area of the island, there were fur traders who practiced trade, Catholic evangelists and explorers designated by the civil and religious authorities. Annually, at the end of spring, loggers went around the banks of the river, including the island to the Cross to return to the water the logs coming down the river to sawmills downstream, including Saint-Stanislas. Log drives ended in 1963 on Batiscan River. After the season of logs driving many workers became \"cageux\" (cage workers) for sawmills, others often went to work on farms in the Lower or Middle-Batiscanie. In the 19th century, the government was granting logging on public lands more distant from the Lower Batiscanie. Prior to the 1888-1889 construction of the railway to Upper Batiscanie, every winter, ice roads were constructed on the Batiscan River by forest contractors to bring hundreds forest workers at a time, accompanied with their herds of horses (sometimes over 100 horses), their sleights, all required rigging and provisions for the use of forest sites in Middle or Upper Batiscanie Batiscanie. These men and their horses coming back down in the spring by the same ice roads before the great debacle. These ice roads should avoid areas where the ice was weak (especially in the rapids or falls) by clearing the pathways on the mainland. The construction of the railway along the Batiscan River and roads (public or private), have reduced the need to use these long ice roads. However, the ice roads continued to be appointed at various places for local needs to cross the river."

The castle's original name, \"tower of the snake\", and the fact that it had seven towers, led to the current name of the city and its coat of arms. In 1963, the Ministry of Culture declared the site a Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural monument.

The infrastructure of \"traditional\" crops is affected, but that is where the widespread use of hydroponic crops is relevant; the main concern with them is actually cost, since indoor structures should be safe from nature. Experts from the University of Puerto Rico argued that these crops could cover approx. 30% of the local demand, particularly that of smaller vegetables such as tomatoes, lettuce, etc. and several kinds of tubers that are currently being imported, opening the door to eventual exportation. The existence of a thriving agricultural economy has been prevented due to a shift in priorities towards industrialization, bureaucratization, mismanagement of terrains, lack of alternative methods and a deficient workforce. Its geographical location within the Caribbean exacerbates these issues, making the scarce existing crops propense to the devastating effects of Atlantic hurricanes."

Coffee production, and sugar cane production in Puerto Rico has had a history of ups and downs, affected by hurricanes and by its isolated location, and its political status as a colony of Spain and of the United States. In 1900, the most important agricultural products in Puerto Rico were \"cotton, rice, cacao, corn, coconuts, pepper, bananas, tobacco, vegetable dyes, coffee, sugar, pineapples and vanilla\". Disaster struck in August 1899, when two hurricanes ravaged the island: the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane on August 8, and an unnamed hurricane on August 22. Approximately 3,400 people died in the floods and thousands were left without shelter, food, or work. The effects on the economy were devastating: millions of dollars were lost due to the destruction of the majority of the sugar and coffee plantations. Afterwards, nearly 5\u201a000 Puerto Ricans migrated to Hawaii by 1910 to work in the sugar plantations of Hawaii. In the 1950s agriculture continued to play a crucial role in the island's economy with the cultivation of pineapples until the 1990s when the main buyer Lotus juice company closed. In 2012, there were 13,159 farms in Puerto Rico. While not a state, Puerto Rico is a member of the Southern United States Trade Association, a non-profit organization that assists the agriculture industry in developing its exports.

Maeght visited the artist in Cala Major (Majorca), and entrusted Josep Llu\u00eds Sert \u2014 the architect who designed Barcelona's Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3 \u2014 with building a museum  and a garden with space for artworks by Mir\u00f3. Mir\u00f3 designed the garden as a labyrinth. He worked with Josep Artigas and Joan Gardy Artigas to create the ceramic artworks for the garden, and with Sert to design the building and surrounding space. Mir\u00f3 prepared several mockups of the artworks, which were finally built in marble, concrete, iron, bronze, and ceramics. These include La fourche (\"The Fork\", built in bronze in 1973) and Le Disque (\"The Disk\", built in ceramics that same year)."

It is organised along three axis: the highest terrace, dominated by a massive concrete arch; a fork on the head of a person suspended in the air overlooking the walkway; and a masonry tower with a ceramic wall made by the artist. The labyrinth can be traversed in any direction, and an hommage to Antoni Gaud\u00ed can be found (a round grey ceramic table reminiscent of Barcelona's Park G\u00fcell). The sculptures include the Solar bird and the Lunar Bird, which neighbour the figure of a giant goddess whose genitalia are covered with the shell of a giant tortoise. There is also a giant egg, the giant cosmic egg:"

        "content": "The Park Hotel was a railway-owned hotel at East Cliff, Preston, Lancashire, England, used for many years as offices, but now being restored as a hotel. The hotel opened in 1883 and was operated jointly by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and London and North Western Railway. In the 1923 grouping of railway companies, ownership passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. When the UK's railways were nationalised in 1948, it passed to the British Transport Commission's Hotels Executive, and thence to British Transport Hotels, who sold it in 1950. It has subsequently been, and as of September 2014 remains, used as offices, and renamed \"East Cliff County Offices\", by Lancashire County Council, who also had a modern annexe, adjacent. Located on a small hill, the red-brick building overlooks Preston railway station, on the West Coast Main Line, to its north-west and Miller Park and the River Ribble to its south-east. In its heyday, the hotel was connected to the southern end of the main south-bound platform (the modern-day platform 4) at Preston station by a covered footbridge Various pre-1923 objects from the hotel are in the National Railway Museum at York. These include Mappin & Webb cutlery and Elkington & Co. tableware and candlesticks, the latter marked with the initials \"P.P.\" and a lamb and flag, the coat of arms of the city. The historic hotel structure was used for many decades as an office building for the Lancashire County Council, along with an adjoining tower, constructed in the 1960s. In 2020, the modern office tower was demolished as part of a plan by the Council to restore the hotel to operation."
